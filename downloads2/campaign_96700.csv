<h3>Gamebook is a hybrid, both an interactive book and a collection of board games.</h3>
<p>Gamebook contains eight abstract strategy board games, carefully selected from the rich gaming heritage that represents human history, our intelligence, wit, strategy and appetite for fun, play and socialising - all gathered in one uniquely designed interactive book, <strong>for you to see, to read and most importantly - to play</strong>. Unlike most board games, Gamebook does not come in a box. Our quest was to think outside the box, pushing boundaries away from both traditional board game packaging and traditional book design. We aim to create a highly unique collection of board games for an international audience using high-quality design and production standards.</p>

<h3>Making Gamebook prototypes</h3>
<p>Gamebook is mostly handcrafted. We have made several prototypes to find the best materials and a suitable shape for the book. Almost the entire book is made using recycled materials.

<h3>Gamebook trilogy</h3>
<p>Research about board games has revealed a whole new world. The history of board games is full of mysteries, myths and secrets. We have created a collection of forgotten board game classics. These games are the foundation of so many modern board games. We have chosen eight board games for the first edition of Gamebook, but we would love to continue our investigation and search for lost board games around the world. There are so many more games to find, explore, study and publish. We want to make a Gamebook collection — possibly a Gamebook trilogy.</p>

<li>Hana Jesih (founder of Gamebook) is a book designer &amp; illustrator who loves to make mind-maps, travel and is taller than Peter. You can see her other book design projects on her <u><a href=""http://www.hanajesih.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>.</u>
</li>
<li>Peter Plantan (cofounder of Gamebook) is an architect who hates and loves everything at the same time and is a fan of Anthony Bourdain.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Video Credits:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Nejc Gazvoda is a film director and writer. He was in charge of the script and directing the video. He wanted to use slider in the video, we made his wish come true.</li>
<li>Marko Pirc takes credit for photography and shooting the presentation video. His favourite sandwich is chips with sausage and chips on the top.</li>

<h3>THANK YOU</h3>
<p><i>Special thanks to NEJC GAZVODA, friend no.1. Big thanks to STAŠ STANKOVIČ and MARKO PIRC from LUMULABS for all advices. They also let us work on the presentation in their office and lent us their equipment and gadgets. MARUŠA HREN for all her tips and help with bookbinding, MILENA JAKOVLJEVIČ from MEDIODROM for tips in mediamarketing, JURE TURK for IT support, NIKO KLANŠEK for business support, GREGA PLANTAN for legal advice, SAMO KRALJ for producing wooden playing sticks, IVO VESELIČ for his own versions of texts and our FAMILY for moral support and food. Thanks also to all other friends who helped us in any kind of way. ;)</i></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>During the process of making the Gamebook prototypes, we collaborated with different print shops and book manufacturers. On a technical level, the pages and binding, even though they are innovative, shouldn't present any major manufacturing difficulties. The final look and materials may change a little bit in the production process, but only to improve the durability and sustainability of the product. The main task will be to manufacture a box for figures and dice that satisfies the level of craftsmanship we stand for. Considering all the facts, we believe that everything is possible if you stand by your goals and believe in your product. We believe in ours. We will try to keep the process as simple as possible. Support our project, and in return we'll send you your own edition of Gamebook. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to post them in the comment section.</p>

Timetable
We have spent the last year researching board game history and designing and testing our Gamebook. All aspects of our designs have been thoroughly considered at each stage of the product creation process, from concept design, materials and technical aspects to numerous prototypes. It’s been a wonderful journey, and now we’re almost ready for the manufacturing stage. If you know any friends, family, colleagues or random strangers who may be interested in our project, please help us spread the word! You can expect to receive your order by December 2018.
 

 
Gamebook trilogy
Research about board games has revealed a whole new world. The history of board games is full of mysteries, myths and secrets. We have created a collection of forgotten board game classics. These games are the foundation of so many modern board games. We have chosen eight board games for the first edition of Gamebook, but we would love to continue our investigation and search for lost board games around the world. There are so many more games to find, explore, study and publish. We want to make a Gamebook collection — possibly a Gamebook trilogy.

Risks and challenges
During the process of making the Gamebook prototypes, we collaborated with different print shops and book manufacturers. On a technical level, the pages and binding, even though they are innovative, shouldn't present any major manufacturing difficulties. The final look and materials may change a little bit in the production process, but only to improve the durability and sustainability of the product. The main task will be to manufacture a box for figures and dice that satisfies the level of craftsmanship we stand for. Considering all the facts, we believe that everything is possible if you stand by your goals and believe in your product. We believe in ours. We will try to keep the process as simple as possible. Support our project, and in return we'll send you your own edition of Gamebook. If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to post them in the comment section.",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

In another crazy project! Yes, this time the project is really peculiar!In our family we have 4 nieces and of course they are super in love with princesses, and various fairy tales, that they make us read or see on repeat! At a certain point we asked ourselves what would happen if the princesses weren't so sweet and cute anymore, but they would get angry and go crazy? And here is the result! In addotion we discovered that the classic fairy tales, the original ones, are anything but cheerful, they are dark and disturbing!Another good reason for our girls to go crazy! By now 3D miniatures are an established reality.When in 2017 we launched the first kickstarter with this formula many called us heretics, avant-gardists and dreamers. Today, just 4 years later, it is a widespread market and a reality that is increasingly entering people's homes. And we are proud to have been the forerunners of this new technology and therefore also on this occasion we offer our sculptures in stl version ready for your 3D printer! PLEASE NOTE - This Kickstarter is for digital files (STLs) to make all these items on your own home 3D printer - these are not physical goods **  All models have been presupported (where necessary)Several printing tests have been carried out to get the Best result possible, and we hope that you will also get an optimal result with your printers. cross lances is committed, as always, to solving any problem you may encounter in printing, fixing the files and creating together with you an ever-improving product. Also this project has many sculptures and many varieties: we thought to satisfy as many people as possible: from collectors who love to print their miniature in resin and paint it, from fantasy football players who in recent years have often supported us, and also to those who are dedicated to filament printing and love scenery and decorative elements. So let's go to present all our sculptures! The first set is about Alice's fantastic adventure in Wonderland! We decided to accompany it with three classic characters: cheshire cat , queen of hearts and mad hatter.Here we introduce a new famous fairy tale: Beauty and the Beast.It seems that its origin is inspired by an event that really happened in Italy, in Viterbo in 1550.But then various versions have followed in history.Sleeping Beauty is another classic fairy tale that has been passed down through time and come down to us.We have documented a bit on the history of this fairy tale, and the first versions are anything but cheerful, indeed they are very disturbing and not suitable for children, if you are curious I recommend you to document and you will be amazed, and perhaps horrified Little Red Riding Hood It's not a princess, no that's true, but it's perhaps the most famous fairy tale of all! This story also underwent several changes in the story going to cut very bad scenes and inserting a happy ending.In the past the stories didn't end very well I would say....From what we have been able to learn, this is the oldest fable that we are going to discuss.It seems in fact that the origins date back even to the Egyptians, and over three hundred versions have been made in history.Traveling around the world has collected variants from China, Persia, Russia, England and who knows how many others up to the present day.Another traditional fairy tale.This time the origins are Danish and we can say that it has more recent origins, in fact it was published for the first time in 1837.But even here the story is a little different from what we remember, and the ending is rather sad.This story has also undergone numerous variations over time and has traveled throughout Europe, there are many ways in which the prince becomes human again. The most famous is surely, as often happens, the one created by the Grimm brothers. Rapunzel is another classic in the history of fairy tales.The myth of the maiden locked in the tower has its origins in ancient Greece with the mythological figure of Danae.But it seems that the true origins of the story come from Italy from a racocnto of 1634.Also here multiple versions and variations, some more alelgre, others decidedly less happy. And here's the prince!Yes, because in every good fairy tale there is a prince!But we wanted to interpret him in a nice way:Going to know more about the classic fairy tales and how they have evolved in history we discovered that these princes were often not so beautiful, good and kind.So we imagined that the princesses got in the way of the prince in revenge for his misdeeds, and he was put to ""work"". Hoping this is nice and doesn't offend anyone! We decided to dedicate a small area also to lovers of scenic and filament printing. We created this castle, partly modular, in fact you can freely assemble the pieces in order to create the composition you prefer. The castle is in fact composed of 16 elements! inspired by the most famous fairy-tale castles in northern Europe. We said we would make a small dedication to our Fantasy Football supporters as well and here it is! Sculpting the seven dwarves from Snow White we realized that a team of dwarves with this design would be beautiful!  Pumpkin carriage.Maybe it would have been better on halloween but we liked carving it anyway. Inside we left it open for those who wish to turn it into a lamp. This time it's Sissi's turn, when we talk about princesses, we can't help but think of her, even if she doesn't belong to a traditional fairy tale but is a historical character who really existed. Here is our interpretation of Princess Sissi!  Here is the dice throwing tower!   Here is the white rabbit! We went to sculpt another of the most famous princesses: the princess on a pea! We have made another of the most famous fairy tales in the world: the three little pigs! Okay, they're not exactly princely, but we think they might like it! Also this time we have moved away from the world of princesses, but it is a fairy tale that is very close to our heart, from the tales of Collodi here is Pinocchio and the Turquoise Fairy!  A whole new team made of many little pinocchios.We really liked the pinocchio sculpture so much that we decided to make a whole team.With the addition of a fire-eater!We hope you like it too!What would a fairy tale be without a dragon?And finally here it is for you, all our princesses (but not only) without weapons.By buying the rights of these files you will be allowed to:- print the 3D miniatures- print them for friends- Print in 3D and resell the printed

Although this is a myth, the design is really quite spectacular and offers a great opportunity to understand other bridge designs. We’re very passionate about bringing the bridge’s unique design into the hands of those interested in the complexities of engineering, fascinated by structural design or just to anyone who’s fond of Cambridge and the beauty of the bridge in real life. The concept of the bridge can be related to countless other bridge designs around the world and for this reason it is invaluable information for anyone interested in bridges and architecture.  We are offering the chance to come along to the River Cam for a bespoke tour by the creator of the bridge. You will see all of the main sights including Kings College, Trinity College, and of course The Mathematical Bridge. You can redeem the punt tour whenever the campaign is over, but we will be in contact once it is so we can organise a time that suits you best. Punting is a great way to spend the day with family and friends, so come along and learn all about the history of Cambridge. Many parents want to get their children into STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics). With that in mind, we believe that outside of the professional industry it’s important for youngsters to practice the skill of modelling from a young age to enhance their engineering minds. This gives them a foundation of knowledge that they can draw on throughout their lives.We are passionate about getting people young and old into Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.We believe it's best to get kids into engineering from a young age using interesting and goal-driven activities. What started with Lego and Meccano should carry on and should give a solid, inspiring goal for all people who like being creative.   We currently have all the manufacturers, printers and infrastructure secured for The Mathematical Bridge Project.Now that these important initial steps are finished, we are looking to launch the kit to as many people as possible. We need funding to get the units made, finalised and sent out to our customers worldwide. This will enable us to bring you more projects in the future and involve more people from around the world in creating them.We felt this would present the perfect opportunity to offer a discounted price for end users, possible suppliers and international clients as it is currently up for sale in Cambridge only.So don't miss out on the chance to buy one before it’s too late!   About the creator:  I am an aerospace engineering graduate and I am looking to find a rewarding place to fit in within the industry of engineering by helping people realise their engineering and modelling interests. I have worked in education (teaching young children), engineering (CAD/ CAM) and also tourism in Cambridge punting around the mathematical bridge, where I came upon the inspiration to create the Mathematical Bridge model. I am interested in creating an excitement for structural design, engineering and manufacturing and I believe this product is a great resource to educate and entertain.",22.0,0,"1 Campaign

<strong>The City that Dripped Blood</strong><br/><strong>An Adventure for Fifth Edition and Swords &amp; Wizardry!</strong>
</h3><p>Frog God Games is proud to announce <i>The City that Dripped Blood</i>, the first in a four part series centered in and around the city Temelpa<i>. </i> This mid-level adventure is written by D &amp; D Legend Steve Winter, whose <a href=""https://rpggeek.com/rpgdesigner/562/steve-winter"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">credits</a> include over 30 years of best selling games, adventures, and supplements for some of the most popular RPG companies in the industry.  He has played a part in many of the most beloved titles from Star Frontiers to the Fifth Edition rule books. He was a contributor most recently to the Frog God Games' <i>Quests of Doom 4 </i>series. Steve's incredible legacy and experience in the RPG world makes <i>The City that Dripped Blood</i> a perfect Indiegogo project debut title. </p><h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3><p><i>Temelpa, an ancient walled city on a forgotten trade route, thought to be abandoned ages ago, and now, the adventurers find themselves besieged within. </i></p><p><i>Unable to leave their refuge, the adventurers will quickly discover the city is inhabited, not deserted as initially believed, by an ancient society.

</ul><p>Since 2012 our crowdfunding approach has been extravagant in every way. Ambitious with massive page counts, plus numerous add-on options and stretch goals. All supporting a primary title itself as many as 990 pages.</p><p>This has resulted in Kickstarter's with memorable pledge rewards that include top-quality hardcover books with sometimes dozens of stretch goal bonuses and add-on extras. These are awesome AND they are expensive.</p><p><i>Is Frog God Games giving up on Kickstarter?</i></p><p>No. Far from it, in fact these smaller projects are happening in response to the feedback we have heard from both fans and 'almost' fans alike. We hear the request for less expensive options for our projects and products all the time. A second frequent desire expressed to us, whether at conventions, on social media or in email, is for a larger selection of smaller, faster-paced adventures that can be completed in 2-3 sessions and not necessitate a full two year campaign.</p><p>Additionally,  Frog God Games has grown in both sales and audience awareness.  This opportunity will give us the additional resources to invest in the very best books in all of our formats. Thus we have launched the first of, what we hope are frequent, 'Tiny Print Run' campaigns on Indiegogo.</p><h3><strong>Project Reward</strong></h3><p>With the wishes of the fans in mind, this and future Indiegogo projects will fund standalone projects that are both affordable and fun. This project, as well future Tiny Print Run projects, is narrowly focused. This means<i>The City that Dripped Blood</i>  will only have two reward options-</p><p style=""margin-left:30.0pt;"">1. A softcover, full-color copy of <i>The City that Dripped Blood </i>which is at least 24 pages long and includes the PDF version</p><p style=""margin-left:1.25in;"">or</p><p style=""margin-left:30.0pt;""><i>2. The City that Dripped Blood</i> in PDF</p><p>There will be <strong>no paid add-on options</strong> and all additional funds raised focus on making the highest quality module the funding can buy.  Supporters will select a rules system when they make the reward selection. For <i>City that Dripped Blood</i> that is a choice between Fifth Edition or <i>Swords &amp; Wizardry</i> (other systems or system agnostic content is possible with future projects).</p><p>As of the project launch <i>The City that Dripped Blood</i>  manuscript is complete for Fifth Edition. It is currently being edited and converted to <i>Swords &amp; Wizardry</i>. The module will be published, what is unknown is how much we raise to improve this release for everyone.</p><h3><strong>What more supporters will mean for the project</strong></h3><p>The level of quality we want to bring to <i>The City of Dripped Blood</i> is, at a minimum, similar softcover releases from larger companies. An example of this is a Wizards of the Coast Adventurer's League softcover. We have the potential to do even better and that is what 18 days will be focused on.</p><p>The best way surpass our quality goal for every supporter (PDF only and/or Print and PDF) is-</p><ul>
<li>Commission more art from top artists</li>
<li>Create more cartography pieces/offer more mapping resources</li>
<li>Create PDF player handouts like creature cards or treasure maps</li>
<li>Other options that are cutting edge and unique which only funding makes possible</li>
</ul><p>The first and most important is to invest in top-quality, custom color art beginning with the cover. At Frog God we have a dedicated gentleman named Casey Christofferson whose job it is to procure great art. His only constraint is his budget, which is were supporters like you come in.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533610870/hbumyowuxgbu0wlefinn.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The biggest milestone will be upgrading from a planned half-page illustration to a full-page color cover by a top artist similar to the examples above. After we have enough funding for the cover we will add additional internal art pieces (possibly full page).</p><h3><strong>Softcover Specific Goals</strong></h3><ul>
<li>The best paper we can afford. Glossy durable pages that showcase the art as it deserves.</li>
<li>A thick, glossy cover stock</li>
<li>Maps/charts/tables reprinted on the interior covers for reference (duplex cover printing)</li>
<li>Signed copies</li>
<li>and a few really special options if the funding really takes off</li>
</ul><p><strong>NOTE ON AVAILABILITY</strong>: The softcover is likely to be a single print run. The number of units we print will be determined by how many supporters choose the <i>The City of Dripped Blood </i>softcover. We have no plans to offer the softcover for general sale after this project ends, so this is the best way to guarantee a copy for yourself in print.</p><h3>Shipping and Distribution</h3><p>Shipping is simple for those who select the a softcover copy of <i>The City of Dripped Blood. </i></p><p><strong>Softcover Shipping</strong></p><ul>
<li>$5 shipping fee will be added upon checkout for supporters in the United States.</li>
<li>$15 shipping fee will be added upon checkout for supporters in the European Union, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.</li>
<li>The PDF that comes with the softcover option will be fulfilled as outlined below.</li>
</ul><p><strong>PDF Distribution</strong></p><ul>
<li>The digital copies will be fulfilled using the Frog God Games Website.</li>
<li>There will be no pledge manager so once the book or PDF is ready we will fulfill using contact information from Indiegogo.</li>

A second frequent desire expressed to us, whether at conventions, on social media or in email, is for a larger selection of smaller, faster-paced adventures that can be completed in 2-3 sessions and not necessitate a full two year campaign.Additionally,  Frog God Games has grown in both sales and audience awareness.  This opportunity will give us the additional resources to invest in the very best books in all of our formats. Thus we have launched the first of, what we hope are frequent, 'Tiny Print Run' campaigns on Indiegogo.Project RewardWith the wishes of the fans in mind, this and future Indiegogo projects will fund standalone projects that are both affordable and fun. This project, as well future Tiny Print Run projects, is narrowly focused. This meansThe City that Dripped Blood  will only have two reward options-1. A softcover, full-color copy of The City that Dripped Blood which is at least 24 pages long and includes the PDF versionor2. The City that Dripped Blood in PDFThere will be no paid add-on options and all additional funds raised focus on making the highest quality module the funding can buy.  Supporters will select a rules system when they make the reward selection. For City that Dripped Blood that is a choice between Fifth Edition or Swords & Wizardry (other systems or system agnostic content is possible with future projects).As of the project launch The City that Dripped Blood  manuscript is complete for Fifth Edition. It is currently being edited and converted to Swords & Wizardry. The module will be published, what is unknown is how much we raise to improve this release for everyone.What more supporters will mean for the projectThe level of quality we want to bring to The City of Dripped Blood is, at a minimum, similar softcover releases from larger companies. An example of this is a Wizards of the Coast Adventurer's League softcover. We have the potential to do even better and that is what 18 days will be focused on.The best way surpass our quality goal for every supporter (PDF only and/or Print and PDF) is-
Commission more art from top artists
Create more cartography pieces/offer more mapping resources
Create PDF player handouts like creature cards or treasure maps
Other options that are cutting edge and unique which only funding makes possible
The first and most important is to invest in top-quality, custom color art beginning with the cover. At Frog God we have a dedicated gentleman named Casey Christofferson whose job it is to procure great art. His only constraint is his budget, which is were supporters like you come in.The biggest milestone will be upgrading from a planned half-page illustration to a full-page color cover by a top artist similar to the examples above. After we have enough funding for the cover we will add additional internal art pieces (possibly full page).Softcover Specific Goals
The best paper we can afford. Glossy durable pages that showcase the art as it deserves.
A thick, glossy cover stock
Maps/charts/tables reprinted on the interior covers for reference (duplex cover printing)
Signed copies
and a few really special options if the funding really takes off
NOTE ON AVAILABILITY: The softcover is likely to be a single print run. The number of units we print will be determined by how many supporters choose the The City of Dripped Blood softcover. We have no plans to offer the softcover for general sale after this project ends, so this is the best way to guarantee a copy for yourself in print.Shipping and DistributionShipping is simple for those who select the a softcover copy of The City of Dripped Blood. Softcover Shipping
$5 shipping fee will be added upon checkout for supporters in the United States.
$15 shipping fee will be added upon checkout for supporters in the European Union, Australia, New Zealand and Canada.
The PDF that comes with the softcover option will be fulfilled as outlined below.
PDF Distribution
The digital copies will be fulfilled using the Frog God Games Website.
There will be no pledge manager so once the book or PDF is ready we will fulfill using contact information from Indiegogo.",2.0,0,"21 Campaigns

<h3>The Savage Kingdoms RPG</h3>
<p>Now entering its 3rd edition after extensive (and highly successful!) playtesting, the Savage Kingdoms heroic sword-and-sorcery is created and designed by Mike Yow, a professional actor and dabbling game designer who has always been passionate about medieval fantasy, roleplaying games, and interactive storytelling. Mike's small indie press company is Fire In The Head Productions based out of the beautiful mountains of Asheville, NC.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1587502825/aitj165jp8a0vgcvb5hv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Savage Kingdoms (and Fire In The Head Productions) needs your help in raising enough funds to adequately pay talented artists and graphic designers to help bring to vivid life its full-color hardcover core rulebook for the new and improved 3rd edition. Offering streamlined and more comprehensive rules, but still maintaining its robust (and yet simple) game system and detailed setting, SK III aims to keep the dream of grittier, immersive, interactive storytelling alive.</p>
<h3>What's Needed &amp; What You'll Get In Return</h3>
</div><div>
<p>At minimum, this project needs a generous $3,000 in order to, as mentioned above, to hire skilled illustrators and graphic designers. This will leave next to nothing for the creator, but that's fine - he's perfectly okay with simply seeing this project succeed and get the attention that it deserves. Any more than $3,000, well, that'd be nice for sure, which would then go to even more artwork - perhaps even affording some famed fantasy illustrators - and maybe even a few bucks for the creator's myriad work-hours (but it's a labor of love, folks!).</p>
<p>For those backing this project, some excellent perks await you - digital files of the complete core rulebook, full-color hardcover books, digital versions of The Savage East campaign supplement (not yet even released!), T-shirts, and our eternal gratitude and further confirmation how wonderful gamers and lovers of medieval fantasy tend to be. </p>

<h3>Impact &amp; The Future</h3>
<p>A successful goal-reaching campaign would mean, not only the production of the full-color hardcover core rulebook, but with enough additional funding - including a potential future Indiegogo campaign - additional productions in the Savage Kingdoms game line will likely be possible. This is includes a full-color hardcover version of The Savage East campaign expansion guide, a potential Game Master's supplement, and other possibilities such as published adventure modules, a Savage Bestiary, and more.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div><p>Naturally, with any crowd-funding campaign, there are always risks that supporters take in somewhat blindly putting their monetary faith in another, and more often than not, someone they don't even personally know. As producers of past crowd-funding projects, we understand this the value of hard-earned money. Moreover, stuff happens in peoples' lives and emergencies occur, our current pandemic situation being a prime example. We, however, enjoy a past track record of crowd-funding successes and have delivered our promises on-time, something we most certainly aim to do again here. </p></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute monetarily, then we'd still love your help in other capacities: spreading the word verbally and on social media, including the tools provided by Indiegogo for sharing and such. Anything (within reason ;)) you can do help make this campaign a reality is more than welcome! </p>

<p>Scenery always adds a lot of atmosphere to any game and greatly contributes to the gaming experience.</p>
<p>We at <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pg/gregsters6mm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><strong>Gregster's Lab</strong></a> have created this building system to be a nice addition to any <strong>3mm, 6mm, 8mm or other small scale</strong> tabletop wargame. Having already made other terrain for small scale miniatures, this line hopefully will also serve many players around the globe.</p>
<p>With this campaign we wish to collect funds to buy all the the rubber necessary for the molding process of these prototypes and enable us to cast them as one-piece buildings. We need to buy also a large quantity of resin for mass production.<br/><br/>We also plan to print some more parts at <strong>Shapeways</strong> in Frosted Ultra Detail quality. We have used this material before and it works fine for master models. </p>
<p>As we reach stretch goals, we can print, mold and cast even more models, building types, accessories and even add bonus items for the contributors. </p>
<h2>The background</h2>
<p>I have previously created several building systems but now it was time to do a better one, with more options and bigger size. Some did not like the smaller <i>GreyDark Research stations</i>, as they were too small for 6mm, but perfect for 3mm. Totally true, so this was one of the reasons I wanted to create taller buildings with enough variety to be able to build diverse terrain for wargames. </p>
<p>I created several panel types from which we built several complete buildings and these will be single cast structures. This way people do not have to spend a considerable time assembling and gluing.  </p>
<p>The different sizes will enable the players to stack these buildings to create more line of sight blocking obstacles and a better looking table. These are the first structures we built, and if people like them, we can create more versions.</p>
<h2>The buildings</h2>
<p>The size of these buildings will enable to use them in multiple scales. Wargames of <strong>3mm, 6mm, 8mm</strong> or even larger scales could benefit from using these on tabletop.</p>
<p>As a starter we have created these buildings and created packs from these for the people to chose from. The buildings are not available individually for the moment.</p>
<p>The buildings are <strong>single cast, hollow pieces</strong>. They will need <strong>no assembly</strong> or gluing. The roof is flat to enable <strong>stacking</strong> them to multiple levels. We also provide <strong>decoration pieces </strong>if you want to spice them up to create a better look. </p>
<h3>PLEASE NOTE: ALL BUILDINGS PICTURED BELOW ARE PROTOTYPES WITH A TEMPORARY ROOF. THE FINAL PRODUCT WILL HAVE THE ROOF CAST TOGETHER WITH THE WALLS THEMSELVES, NOT AS A SEPARATE PIECE!<br/>Only the painted example is a single cast, hollow test piece.<br/> </h3>

<p><strong>At each pledge, you can find the weight of the pack in grams.</strong><br/><br/>The invoice for the shipping needs to be paid after the campaign closes.</p>
<p>Each contributor will be contacted individually and informed about the cost and payment.<br/><br/>If multiple items are bought, we need to check the final weight (including packaging) to charge you correctly. We wish to avoid overcharging anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Approximate</strong> shipping prices (based on the data from the post)</p>

<p>250 - 500 gr -- Within EU: 15 USD, Outside EU: 20 USD</p>

<h2><strong>Who we are</strong></h2>
<p>We are two guys from Hungary, Budapest who love creating things for our tabletop wargame hobby.</p>
<p>My name is Gergely. I am running the Facebook page ""<strong><a href=""/www.facebook.com/gregsters6mm/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Gregsters's Lab in 6mm</a></strong>"" where you can already see some of my other creations. </p>
<p>I did the 3D design of the buildings and my friend, Daniel is doing the resin casting. <br/>I am an active Epic: Armageddon player, painter, scratch-builder who ventured into the world of digital creation and I am having fun creating things. </p>
<p>My friend Daniel has lot of experience in resin casting. On his <strong><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/sebitarworkshop/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook page</a></strong> you can check all the things he has been commissioned to cast. Without him, this would stay in digital form only.<br/>We have already used Indiegogo to make the creations available to gamers like us and to collect funds to be able to print and cast as many parts as possible. If you support us, we will be able to realize more and more designs and launch more campaigns in the future.</p>

We at Gregster's Lab have created this building system to be a nice addition to any 3mm, 6mm, 8mm or other small scale tabletop wargame. Having already made other terrain for small scale miniatures, this line hopefully will also serve many players around the globe.
With this campaign we wish to collect funds to buy all the the rubber necessary for the molding process of these prototypes and enable us to cast them as one-piece buildings. We need to buy also a large quantity of resin for mass production.We also plan to print some more parts at Shapeways in Frosted Ultra Detail quality. We have used this material before and it works fine for master models. 
As we reach stretch goals, we can print, mold and cast even more models, building types, accessories and even add bonus items for the contributors. 
The background
I have previously created several building systems but now it was time to do a better one, with more options and bigger size. Some did not like the smaller GreyDark Research stations, as they were too small for 6mm, but perfect for 3mm. Totally true, so this was one of the reasons I wanted to create taller buildings with enough variety to be able to build diverse terrain for wargames. 
I created several panel types from which we built several complete buildings and these will be single cast structures. This way people do not have to spend a considerable time assembling and gluing.  
The different sizes will enable the players to stack these buildings to create more line of sight blocking obstacles and a better looking table. These are the first structures we built, and if people like them, we can create more versions.
The buildings
The size of these buildings will enable to use them in multiple scales. Wargames of 3mm, 6mm, 8mm or even larger scales could benefit from using these on tabletop.
As a starter we have created these buildings and created packs from these for the people to chose from. The buildings are not available individually for the moment.
The buildings are single cast, hollow pieces. They will need no assembly or gluing. The roof is flat to enable stacking them to multiple levels. We also provide decoration pieces if you want to spice them up to create a better look. 
PLEASE NOTE: ALL BUILDINGS PICTURED BELOW ARE PROTOTYPES WITH A TEMPORARY ROOF. THE FINAL PRODUCT WILL HAVE THE ROOF CAST TOGETHER WITH THE WALLS THEMSELVES, NOT AS A SEPARATE PIECE!Only the painted example is a single cast, hollow test piece. 
Building ASize 1x1 panel with large fins on the sides + 1 single doorApproximate size: 60x60mm, 45mm tall

Building BSize 3x1 panels with large fins on the sides + 2 single doorsApproximate size: 60x110mm, 45mm tall

Building E
Dwarfing the other buildings, this massive piece is a perfect base for huge constructs.Approximate size: 160x190mm, 45mm tallApproximate weight: 450gBuilding E comes together with some extra items:

1x Building M (gas container)

Other items
Building O
Landing pad
The landing pad we can show you best as the screenshot of the 3D model to be better visible.

We had a similar landing pad in one of our campaigns, but his one is double sized.Without the extra details, the landing pad is 120x90mm
Building P
Perimeter defense tower
The tower serves as protection for your facilities. You can place them on the buildings or around them. Two turret versions are included. One normal, and one AA gun.Size is 20x20x16mm.It is very hard to take pictures of the transparent 3D model, so I also added here the 3D view. 
  
Example of use:

Who we are
We are two guys from Hungary, Budapest who love creating things for our tabletop wargame hobby.
My name is Gergely. I am running the Facebook page ""Gregsters's Lab in 6mm"" where you can already see some of my other creations. 
I did the 3D design of the buildings and my friend, Daniel is doing the resin casting. I am an active Epic: Armageddon player, painter, scratch-builder who ventured into the world of digital creation and I am having fun creating things. 
My friend Daniel has lot of experience in resin casting. On his Facebook page you can check all the things he has been commissioned to cast. Without him, this would stay in digital form only.We have already used Indiegogo to make the creations available to gamers like us and to collect funds to be able to print and cast as many parts as possible. If you support us, we will be able to realize more and more designs and launch more campaigns in the future.

Other issues
For the time being we have limited the number of available perks. If there is a bigger interest, we could open new perks but we do not want take on a task that we cannot handle on time. Also, when the campaign is over, our products would be later available in a webshop.

After our successful campaign in Kickstarter, we wish to present an opportunity to all those backers who missed the initial campaign to pre-order and buy our products. We've designed and hand-crafted two complete sets of stadium scenery, compatible with the new(2016) and old 'Blood Ball' games and re-invented the Dice Tower. These sets are molded in high detail resin and include multiple modular components which are easily assembled / dis-assembled using OpenLOCK interlocking widgets.</p><p><strong>Dice Tower</strong></p><p>Our project brainstorms allowed us to come up with many innovative design elements, but amongst the most outstanding are our incredible Dice Towers. We needed a dice mechanism for our fantasy football game that would integrate well with our scenery options, but at the same time perform their required function. To this end we racked our brains and came up with a completely new dice tower mechanism, the Funnel System. Our Funnel System Dice Towers allow for the design of extraordinary towers well beyond what has been seen up to now, whilst optimizing its mechanism for even better dice rolling results.</p><p><a href=""http://i-lovecraft.com/index.php/2017/05/01/patent/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The science behind it.</a></p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/zYRZDMhN4js?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1507038230/edrrqfmf6uezkax4zde9.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>Stand Alone Dice Towers</strong></p><p>We thought it would be unfair to create such wonderful Dice Towers and limit them to fantasy football, so we then decided to go one step further for our backers and created Stand Alone versions for them.

Shipping rate will be made available to our backers as our project progresses and we receive quotes and information on the best logistic deals for your area.</p><p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p><p>We have already created all the master models for the project and associated molds, but we want to invest time and resources in creating superior high resolution molds that will allow us to mass produce the product effectively. We have a lot of experience in this field and this should pose no problem at all.</p><p>Backers have to take understand that this product is essentially hand crafted. The products go through a machine process where the parts are molded, but then each piece is reviewed and modified were needed by our craftsmen. We file away burs, assemble parts and make sure each part meets our quality standard. The fact that the parts are finished by hand means that there might be slight variations between parts which are a reflection of the artisanal work which makes each model unique. Although this is true, all measurements are kept to less than a 1mm precision tolerance were needed to slot or fit.</p><p>The parts come unpainted although some parts require a finishing coat of acrylic to homogenize and protect the assembled product. This protection coat serves for a better visual finish of the product and in no way will affect the application of future paint works by the user, on the contrary, it will help and aid as a primer increasing adhesion and protecting the surface.</p><p>Models will be cast in grey pigmented resin as default, which is a nice neutral colour to paint on.

After our successful campaign in Kickstarter, we wish to present an opportunity to all those backers who missed the initial campaign to pre-order and buy our products. We've designed and hand-crafted two complete sets of stadium scenery, compatible with the new(2016) and old 'Blood Ball' games and re-invented the Dice Tower. These sets are molded in high detail resin and include multiple modular components which are easily assembled / dis-assembled using OpenLOCK interlocking widgets.Dice TowerOur project brainstorms allowed us to come up with many innovative design elements, but amongst the most outstanding are our incredible Dice Towers. We needed a dice mechanism for our fantasy football game that would integrate well with our scenery options, but at the same time perform their required function. To this end we racked our brains and came up with a completely new dice tower mechanism, the Funnel System. Our Funnel System Dice Towers allow for the design of extraordinary towers well beyond what has been seen up to now, whilst optimizing its mechanism for even better dice rolling results.The science behind it.  Stand Alone Dice TowersWe thought it would be unfair to create such wonderful Dice Towers and limit them to fantasy football, so we then decided to go one step further for our backers and created Stand Alone versions for them. These Stand Alone versions come with beautiful inlay wooden bases that allow for a larger dice capacity and to be used with any dice rolling game.  The wooden base is around 25cm in diameter and will have a Walnut/Sapeli base and Oak/Pine inlay finish. Material and finish depends on availability but the renditions above demonstrate the planned finished look we propose for our product. Dice are not included and model comes unpainted in resin colour as demonstrated above.The inlay shown above on the Dice Tray, the Triquetra, is the Default inlay, but there is the option for no inlay on their base.Scenery Themed Bundle AssemblyWe have opted to use OpenLOCK as our system to interlock all pitch scenery modules. We include with the bundle a widget pack which contain 20 pieces of OpenLOCK widgets that allow to fit or release the modules together. Workshops, Production and ShippingWe will try to produce orders were possible, in our Europe and USA workshops respectively. This will reduce the shipping cost for our customers on both these continents. That give us different options and we are confident we will be able to provide fair shipping rates, that will be calculated and charged when the production is finished.We still don't have enough information on packaging and total weight of the project to be able to issue shipping rates. Shipping rate will be made available to our backers as our project progresses and we receive quotes and information on the best logistic deals for your area.Risks and challengesWe have already created all the master models for the project and associated molds, but we want to invest time and resources in creating superior high resolution molds that will allow us to mass produce the product effectively. We have a lot of experience in this field and this should pose no problem at all.Backers have to take understand that this product is essentially hand crafted. The products go through a machine process where the parts are molded, but then each piece is reviewed and modified were needed by our craftsmen. We file away burs, assemble parts and make sure each part meets our quality standard. The fact that the parts are finished by hand means that there might be slight variations between parts which are a reflection of the artisanal work which makes each model unique. Although this is true, all measurements are kept to less than a 1mm precision tolerance were needed to slot or fit.The parts come unpainted although some parts require a finishing coat of acrylic to homogenize and protect the assembled product. This protection coat serves for a better visual finish of the product and in no way will affect the application of future paint works by the user, on the contrary, it will help and aid as a primer increasing adhesion and protecting the surface.Models will be cast in grey pigmented resin as default, which is a nice neutral colour to paint on. Some parts may show very slight variations of this grey according to the process the particular part has undergone.In some circumstances, it will be possible to match the resin colour to other hues other than the default grey. For example, wood coloured objects, such as barrels may be presented in brown pigment to reflect the wood material they are trying to simulate as a model. We will try to do this if and where possible.Our Company Follow us on social media:Website    : http://www.i-lovecraft.com/Facebook : https://www.facebook.com/lovecraftproductions/Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/i.lovecraft/Twitter      : https://twitter.com/I_LovecraftTeam/",6.0,4,"1 Campaign

Kerrotaan, että muinaisina aikoina astraterralaisten esi-isät olisivat rakentaneet valtavan renkaan muotoisen maailman, joka tuhoutui Muinaisten Sodassa ja pirstaloitui tuhansiksi ja tuhansiksi pienemmiksi kappaleiksi, jotka tunnetaan nykyään <i>taivaankappaleina</i>. </p><p>Taivaankappaleita yhdistää tähtimeri, joka on kuin ääretön sinitaivas, jossa aurinkotuulten avulla lentävät aurinkopurjelaivat seilaavat.

Nämä saaret ovat muodostaneet pyörteisiä haaroja, jotka kurottavat Vyöltä kuumaa aurinkoa ympäröivää Kurimusta kohti. </span></p><p>Kurimuksen ja Pyörteen välissä on kuitenkin omituinen alue, joka tunnetaan Myrskynä. Se on rengasmainen tähtisumu, joka toisaalta himmentää auringon valoa niin, etteivät auringon kuumat tuulet paahda pyörteen ja Vyön taivaankappaleita karrelle, kuten Kurimuksen saarille on käynyt. Toisaalta se on omituinen ja vaarallinen paikka, jossa kasvit ja hyönteiset kasvavat jättimäisiksi ja siellä valllitsee ankarat sään vaihtelut ja meteoriittisateet ovat tavallisia. </p><p>Suurin osa Myrskyyn lipuneista saarista on hylätty aarteineen jo vuosisatoja sitten ja nyt niille suoritetaan uskaliaita löytöretkiä alati ehtyvän eteriumin ja kallisarvoisten teknoaarteiden ja jalohopean löytämisen toivossa. Eterium on arvokas ja harvinainen aine, jonka avulla voidaan käyttää muinaisten teknotaarteita sekä tuottaa tehokkaasti höyryvoimaa. Jalohopea puolestaan on muinaisten luoma metalli, joka on uskomattoman kestävää, mutta helposti muokattavaa ja korjaantuu itsestään. </p><p>Joka puolella tätä eriskummallista ja ihmeellistä maailmaa on kaukoportteina tunnettuja mustia kivipylväitä, jotka vuosituhansien ajan ovat seisseen paikallaan ylväinä ja vaitonaisina. Kunnes yllättäen kaksitoista vuotta sitten, eräänä aivan tavallisena päivänä mustaan kiveen ilmestyi vaimeasti hehkuvia kaiverruksia ja ensimmäiset portaalit kaukoporttien välillä avautuivat ilman mitään ilmeistä syytä. Valkoisena hehkuvat kiekkomaiset portit odottivat hiljaa humisten, kunnes ensimmäiset uskaliaat tutkimusmatkailijat astuivat niiden läpi ja palasivat takaisin mukanaan ensimmäiset uudet porttikordinaatit.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475833144/irt03xfsqc63wwmrqc1p.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1475833241/tva8lc8arowuukq6mlag.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><p>Astraterrassa pelaajien sankarihahmot ovat rohkeita löytöretkeilijöitä, jotka suorittavat tutkimusretkiä eri puolille Astraterraa uudelleen käynnistettyjen kaukoporttien kautta. kaukoportit ovat olleet poissa käytöstä vuosisatojen ajan ja  ne ovat hajonneet ympäri Astraterraa.

Tänä vuonna minulla oli kunnia ottaa vastaan vuosittain jaettava kotimaisen roolipelialan merkittävin tunnustuspalkinto, <i>Kultainen lohikäärme</i>. Olen työskennelyt aiemmin 8 vuotta projektipäällikkönä media-alalla ja tuottajana pelialalla, jonka vuoksi minulla on hyvä ote projektinhallintaan ja pelituotantoon. Nykyään työskentelen Senior Game Designerina pelialalla PC-simulaatio pelien parissa.</p>

<h3>Apulaissuunnittelijat, kommentointi ja testaus</h3>
<p>Astraterran suunnittelussa on ollut mukana myös minun kolme vanhinta lasta ja koko perhe jossain määrin. Astraterra onkin siinä mielessä omalaatuinen roolipeliteos, että sitä on ollut mukana tekemässä lapset, jotka myös edustavat pelin pelaajakuntaa. Lapset ovat ideoineet pelimekaniikkoja ja useita otuksia olentopediaan sekä yksityiskohtia pelimaailmaan.</p>
<p>Pelisuunnittelussa on ollut tukena myös useita muita kotimaisia roolipelisuunnittelijoita, kuten <i>Jukka Sorsa</i>, <i>Samuli Ahokas</i>, <i>Ville Takanen </i>ja<i> Jukka Särkijärvi</i>. Lisäksi olemme saaneet korvaamatonta palautetta kymmeniltä Astraterran pelaajilta.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Kuvitus</h3>
<p>Pelin kuvituksesta vastaa koko joukko lahjakkaita kuvittajia. Suurin osa kuvituksesta on <i>Olli Hietalan</i>, <i>Olli Juutilaisen</i>, <i>Jari Paanasen</i>, <i>Hans Zenjugan</i>, <i>Simo Latvasen</i> ja <i>Oskari Wäänäsen</i> aikaansaannosta.   </p>

<h3>Miksi Indiegogo ja ennakkomyynti?</h3>
<p>Roolipelien suunnittelu ja julkaisu on minulle sivutoimista toimintaa, joka on enemmän vakavaa harrastelua, kuin varsinaista yrittämistä. Ennen kaikkea teen tätä intohimosta roolipeleihin ja pelisuunnitteluun. Minulle paras palkkio on, kun saan kuulla, että joku on viihtynyt ja kokenut hienoja hetkiä pelatessaan pelejäni. Astraterran suhteen erityisen hienoa on ollut jakaa oma roolipeliharrastus yhdessä lasten kanssa. </p>
<p>Kaikkihan oisi mutkatonta, jos pelien tuottaminen olisi ilmaista hommaa, mutta roolipelien tuotantokustannukset voivat vaihdella suuresti riippuen muun muassa painosmäärästä ja painotekniikasta. Kovakantisten ja värillisten kirjojen painatuksen kohdalla puhutaan lähtökohtaisesti vähintään 500 kappaleen painoseristä ja useiden tuhansien eurojen kuluista (per kirja) jo pelkkien välttämättömien paino- ja kuvituskulujen kanssa.</p>
<p>Ennakkomyynti onkin kaltaiselleni mikroyrittäjälle erinomainen tapa ottaa selville tuotteen mahdollinen menekki ennen sen painatusta jolloin voin käyttää ennakkomyynnissä kerätyt varat mahdollisimman tehokkaasti kirjan tuottamiseen parhaalla mahdollisella laadulla. </p>
<p>Indiegogota valitsin käyttää, koska <i>Kickstarter</i>-kampanjaa ei voi Suomesta käsin käynnistää ilman välikäsiä ja olen käyttänyt Indiegogota aiemmin jo kahteen muuhun vastaavaan ennakkomyyntikampanjaan (<a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/astraterra-seikkailuroolipeli-kaikenikaisille"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Astraterran 1. laitos</a> ja <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sotakarjut-poytaroolipeli-tulevaisuuden-sotilaista-rpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sotakarjut</a>) ja se on mielestäni toiminut hyvin ja luotettavasti.</p>

</div></div>","Tervetuloa tutustumaan Astraterran 2. laitoksen joukkorahoitukseen!Piiiitkän harkitsemisen ja pähkäilyn ja suunnitelun jälkeen minulla on ilo ilmoittaa, että ​huippusuosittu kaikenikäisten seikkailuroolipeli, Astraterra, palaa uudistettuna kaikkien saataville!Ole hyvä ja katso oheinen video (jos et sitä jo katsonut), tai lue alta lisää Astraterran 2. laitoksesta ja sen joukkorahoituksesta. Mutta ihan ensiksi lyhyt katsaus Astraterran uuteen laitokseen.   Astraterra on koko perheen seikkailupeli, jossa löytöretket, höyrykoneet, aurinkotuulilla purjehtivat aurinkopurjelaivat sekä ihmeelliset teknoaarteet ovat sankareiden arkipäivää. Astraterran sankarit ovat löytöretkeilijöitä, joiden tehtävänä on tutkia ja uudelleen kartoittaa sirpaleisen maailman unohdettuja kolkkia. Seikkailuillaan sankarit tulevat kohtaamaan mitä omituisempia otuksia, myrskyrosvoja ja ihmeellisiä paikkoja. Astraterrassa pelaajat roolipelaavat kukin omaa sankarihahmoaan ja pelaamisen tuloksena syntyy tarina sankarien seikkailuista.Peli soveltuu lähes kaiken ikäisille, niin aloittelijoille kuin hieman kokeneemmille roolipelikonkareillekin. Astraterra on suunniteltu yhdessä lasten kanssa, joten se on varmasti lapsille sopiva.Astraterran 2. Laitos on yhteensopiva ensimmäisen laitoksen kanssa, mutta myös uudistaa peliä monella tapaa. Näkyvin uudistus on kirjan jakaminen kahteen erilliseen kovakantiseen kirjaan: pelaajien Löytöretkeilijän oppaaseen ja pelinjohtajan Kertojan käsikirjaan.Tämän ohella sääntöjä on muun muassa jäsennelty uudelleen ja hahmojen kehitykseen on tuotu lisää vaihtoehtoja. Pelimaailman kuvausta, olentopediaa, lemmikkivalikoimaa ja varustelistaa on myös laajennettu entisestään. Tältä Astraterran 2. laitoksen kirjat saattaisivat näyttää. Pelaajan kirja – Löytöretkeilijän opas
Pelaajan kirja on Astraterran 2. laitoksen peruskirja ja tarvitsen sen pelataksesi Astraterraa. Tästä kirjasta löytyy: 


Johdanto: kirjan alussa on lyhyt johdatus roolipelaamiseen ja Astraterran maailmaan ja sen tärkeimpiin valtakuntiin, paikkoihin ja muihin yksityiskohtiin ja listattuna muutamien tavallisimpien otusten tiedot lyhyesti.

Säännöt: pelaamiseen tarvittavat säännöt 

Lajit ja Roolit: kuusi eri pelattavaa lajia ja roolia.

Sankarit: hahmonluonti ja -kehityssäännöt

Varusteet: varusteita, aseita ja suojuksia aina kolmen metrin seipäästä pasautuspyssyihin ja höyryhaarniskoihin.

Lemmikit: lista lemmikkejä sekä säännöt lemmikkien kouluttamiselle ja villieläinten kesyttämiselle.  


 
Pelinjohtajan kirja – Kertojan käsikirja
Kertojan käsikirja on tarkoitettu pelinjohtajan työkalupakiksi ja apuvälineeksi omia seikkailuja ja pidempiä pelikampanjoita suunnitellessa. Kertojan käsikirja sisältää seuraavat osiot:

Astraterran atlas: maailman historiaa ja maailman eri osien ja tärkeiden paikkojen kuvauksia.


Muinaisten salaisuudet: Tietoa astratekistä, eli teknoaarteista, elokoneista ja muista Muinaisten jäänteistä. Tässä osiossa kerrotaan salaisuuksista, jotka avaavat muun muassa Myrskyn, eteepien ja eteriumin merkitystä Astraterran maailmassa.


Löytöretket: ohjeita omien seikkailujen suunnitteluun.


Kohtaamisia: ohjeita mielenkiintoisten olentojen ja sivuhahmojen suunnitteluun.


Konkarisääntöjä: erilaisia tapoja syventää ja maustaa pelin sääntöjä oman maun mukaan.


Olentopedia: Astraterrassa kohdattavien kummallisten olentojen ja villieläinten tietoja sekä ohjeita olentojen muuttamiseen ja omien olentojen suunnitteluun.

 Strategiset mitatLähtökohtaisesti sekä pelaajan että pelinjohtajan kirjat ovat noin 100-120 sivuisia kovakantisia kirjoja, joissa on värikuvitus. Sivumäärä voi vielä muuttua, kun saavutamme  jatkotavoitteita, tai jos kirjan paperikoko vielä muuttuu. Kooltaan kirjat ovat letter-kokoa (8,5"" × 11"" / 216 x 279 mm).   Astraterra sijoittuu maailmaan joka koostuu eri kokoisista pohjattomalla taivaalla leijuvista kivisaarekkeista. Pienimmät näistä ovat kareja ja saaria, mutta suurimmat ovat mantereiden kokoisia ja omia maailmoja itsessään. Kerrotaan, että muinaisina aikoina astraterralaisten esi-isät olisivat rakentaneet valtavan renkaan muotoisen maailman, joka tuhoutui Muinaisten Sodassa ja pirstaloitui tuhansiksi ja tuhansiksi pienemmiksi kappaleiksi, jotka tunnetaan nykyään taivaankappaleina. Taivaankappaleita yhdistää tähtimeri, joka on kuin ääretön sinitaivas, jossa aurinkotuulten avulla lentävät aurinkopurjelaivat seilaavat. Tähtimeren rajat sanelevat missä laivat voivat seilata, sillä tähtimeren reunalla ilma ja lämpö alkavat haihtua olemattomiin ja lopulta painovoimakin katoaa. Tähtimeren äärien tuolla puolen on vain lohduton pimeys, jossa ei ole elämälle sijaa.  Suurin osa taivaankappaleista on asettunut rengasmaiselle radalle kiertämään kaiken keskellä olevaa aurinkoa, mutta osa pienemmistä saarista lipuu vääjäämättä aurinkoa kohti. Nämä saaret ovat muodostaneet pyörteisiä haaroja, jotka kurottavat Vyöltä kuumaa aurinkoa ympäröivää Kurimusta kohti. Kurimuksen ja Pyörteen välissä on kuitenkin omituinen alue, joka tunnetaan Myrskynä. Se on rengasmainen tähtisumu, joka toisaalta himmentää auringon valoa niin, etteivät auringon kuumat tuulet paahda pyörteen ja Vyön taivaankappaleita karrelle, kuten Kurimuksen saarille on käynyt. Toisaalta se on omituinen ja vaarallinen paikka, jossa kasvit ja hyönteiset kasvavat jättimäisiksi ja siellä valllitsee ankarat sään vaihtelut ja meteoriittisateet ovat tavallisia. Suurin osa Myrskyyn lipuneista saarista on hylätty aarteineen jo vuosisatoja sitten ja nyt niille suoritetaan uskaliaita löytöretkiä alati ehtyvän eteriumin ja kallisarvoisten teknoaarteiden ja jalohopean löytämisen toivossa. Eterium on arvokas ja harvinainen aine, jonka avulla voidaan käyttää muinaisten teknotaarteita sekä tuottaa tehokkaasti höyryvoimaa. Jalohopea puolestaan on muinaisten luoma metalli, joka on uskomattoman kestävää, mutta helposti muokattavaa ja korjaantuu itsestään. Joka puolella tätä eriskummallista ja ihmeellistä maailmaa on kaukoportteina tunnettuja mustia kivipylväitä, jotka vuosituhansien ajan ovat seisseen paikallaan ylväinä ja vaitonaisina. Kunnes yllättäen kaksitoista vuotta sitten, eräänä aivan tavallisena päivänä mustaan kiveen ilmestyi vaimeasti hehkuvia kaiverruksia ja ensimmäiset portaalit kaukoporttien välillä avautuivat ilman mitään ilmeistä syytä. Valkoisena hehkuvat kiekkomaiset portit odottivat hiljaa humisten, kunnes ensimmäiset uskaliaat tutkimusmatkailijat astuivat niiden läpi ja palasivat takaisin mukanaan ensimmäiset uudet porttikordinaatit.   Astraterrassa pelaajien sankarihahmot ovat rohkeita löytöretkeilijöitä, jotka suorittavat tutkimusretkiä eri puolille Astraterraa uudelleen käynnistettyjen kaukoporttien kautta. kaukoportit ovat olleet poissa käytöstä vuosisatojen ajan ja  ne ovat hajonneet ympäri Astraterraa. Tämän vuoksi aina ei voi olla varma, mitä kaukoportin määränpäässä on. Löytöretkeilijät saattavat yhtä hyvin päätyä asuttamattomalle villipetojen täyttämälle saarelle, muinaisen linnan raunioon tai muinaisten avaruuslaivan hylyn sisälle.Löytöretkiltään hahmot voivat löytää ihmeellisiä teknoaarteita, eteriumia ja muita arvoesineitä. Yleensä sopimus menee niin, että löytöretkeilijät saavat pitää löytöretkiltään niin paljon aarteita, kuin jaksavat kantaa, mutta määränpäästä löytyvä eterium sekä muut aarteet ja luonnonrikkaudet kuuluvat Porttikillalle.Usein nämä aarteet eivät kuitenkaan tule ilman haasteita. Löytöretkillä hahmot voivat kohdata monenlaisia vaaroja ja pulmia, joiden selvittäminen kysyy rohkeutta ja nokkeluutta sekä joskus ihan pelkkää raakaa voimaa. Tästä syystä löytöretkille eivät lähdekään ketkä tahansa, vaan ainoastaan oikeat sankarit.Astraterran 2. laitoksessa on kuusi lajia ja roolia, joita yhdistämällä voi rakentaa oman hahmonsa. Voit lukea lisää Astraterran maailmasta ja sankareista TÄÄLTÄ.  Astraterran säännöt käyttävät tavallisia kuusitahoisia noppia. Yleensä, jos hahmo kohtaa haasteen, jossa onnistuminen on epävarmaa tehdään kykyheitto.Kykyheitto tehdään heittämällä tietty määrä noppia kerralla ja heitettävien noppien määrä määräytyy tavallisesti hahmon kykyjen ja olosuhteiden mukaan. Jotkin erityisvarusteet tai toisten hahmojen apu voivat myös antaa lisänoppia heittoihin. Kun heitettävien noppien määrä on selvillä, ne kaikki heitetään kerralla. Nopat joiden tulos on 1, 2 tai 3 poistetaan pöydästä. Nopat joiden tulos oli 4, 5 tai 6 ovat onnistumisia ja ne jäävät pöytään. Lisäksi nopat, joiden tulos oli 6, antaa heittää yhden lisänopan kutakin kuutosta kohden. Mutta tässä on riskinsä. Omien kykyjen puskeminen äärimmilleen saattaa nimittäin johtaa noloihin kommeluksiin.Jos onnistumisia on vähintään tehtävän vastuksen verran tai enemmän kuin vastustajalla, hahmo onnistuu pyrkimyksissään.  Voit tilata jonkin saatavilla olevista tuotepaketeista (Perk) ja, jos tuotepaketti jättää yksityiskohtia auki (kuten t-paidan koko tai malli), ne hoidetaan jälkikäteen Backerkit -nimisen palvelun kautta. Tarkempaa tietoa Backerkitistä löydät alempaa tuotepakettien jälkeen.
 

 
 

Postikulut
Kaikkiin postitettaviin tuotteisiin lisätään toimituskulut. Toimituskulut ovat yhdestä kirjasta 5€ ja kahdesta tai useammasta kirjasta 8€ per lähetys. Tuotepaketin toimituskulut kattaa kaikki tilatut tuotteet, myös oheistuotteet, ellei toisin mainita.
 
Tilaaminen ja Maksaminen
Astraterran 2. laitoksen tilaaminen ja maksaminen tapahtuu Indiegogon kautta. Voit maksaa tilauksesi Paypal-tilisi kautta tai luottokortilla Paypal-palvelussa, jos sinulla ei ole Paypal-tiliä (ks. kuva alla). 
 

 
Kampanjassa on niin sanottu kiinteä rahoitus, eli jos kampanja ei kerää tavoiteltua summaa, rahat palautetaan tilaajille joukkorahoituksen päättymisen jälkeen. 
 
Backerkit
Backerkit on palvelu, joka auttaa meitä keräämään tilaukset ja pitämään niistä kirjaa Indiegogon ennakkomyynnin jälkeen. Se auttaa meitä myös pitämään Sinun toimitusosoiteesi ajantasalla. Backerkit ei aiheuta Sinulle minkäänlaisia lisäkuluja. 
Saat ennakkomyynnin jälkeen sähköpostilla linkin kyselyyn, jossa pääset tarkistamaan tilauksesi. Yksinkertaisimmillaan tarkistat vain, että tilauksessasi on oikeat tuotteet ja oikea toimitusosoite, kuten missä tahansa verkkokaupassa asioidessasi. 
 
Aikataulu
Varaamme 3-4 kuukautta tuotteiden viimeistelyyn ja toimitukseen kampanjan päättymisen jälkeen. Toimitusaikaan vaikuttaa mm. Se tuotetaanko kirjat tarvepainatettuina vai offset-painossa tai tuleeko kamppanjassa kahden sääntökirjan lisäksi muita painotuotteita, jotka vaativat omat valmistelunsa. Offset-painotalot kykenevät käsittelemään tilaukset ja vedokset huomattavasti nopeammin.
 
Nimi kirjaan
Kaikki joukkorahoitukseen osallistuneet saavat halutessaan nimensä kirjaan. Kirjaan tuleva nimi vahvistetaan Backerkit-kyselyn yhteydessä joukkorahoituksen jälkeen. 
 

Löytöretkeilijäin seuran jäsentodistus
Ensimmäiset 100 kovakantisen pelikirjan tilannutta saa nimikoidun ja numeroidun Löytöretkeilijäin seuran jäsentodistuksen tilauksen mukana.
 
Entäs oheistuotteet?
Oheistuotteet tulevat saataville viimeistään, kun Backerkit-palvelu avataan joukkorahoituksen jälkeen. 
 
 
 
 


Tavoitteena oli kerätä 4000€ ennakkomyyntiä kattamaan mm. kirjojen painoon, taittoon, kuvitukseen ja ohjelmoistoihin liittyviä tuotantokuluja. Tämä on nyt saavutettu ja joukkorahoitusjakson aikana kerättiin ennakkomyyntejä kaikkiaan 7000€ edestä. 
Aikataulusyistä muut jatkotavoitteet on nyt lukittu, mutta Astraterra on edelleen tilattavissa ennakkoon ja kaikkiin ennakkotilauksiin kuuluu kaikki tähän saakka saavutetut edut!
Merkinnät ja muuta huomioitavaa

– Sisältyy kaikkiin tilauksiin, joissa on Löytöretkeilijän opas (pelaajan kirja) ja/tai Kertojan käsikirja (pelinjohtajan kirja).
 

 – Erillinen lisäosa tai oheistuote, joka julkaistaan printtinä ja/tai PDF-versiona.
 

– Tämä päivitys sisältyy vain tietyn hintaisiin ja sitä arvokkaampiin tuotepaketteihin. Muihin paketteihin nämä tuotteet voi ostaa erikseen oheistuotteina, heti kun ne on saavutettu.
 

Pehmeäkantiset kirjat – Kaikki pehmeäkantiset kirjat ovat tarvepainatettuja, joten niihin ei ole mahdollista saada sisäkanteen kuvitusta, parempilaatuista paperia tai muita parannuksia kirjan laatuun. Pehmeäkantisia kirjoja siis koskevat ainoastaan sivumäärään vaikuttavat jatkotavoitteet.

Apulaissuunnittelijat, kommentointi ja testaus
Astraterran suunnittelussa on ollut mukana myös minun kolme vanhinta lasta ja koko perhe jossain määrin. Astraterra onkin siinä mielessä omalaatuinen roolipeliteos, että sitä on ollut mukana tekemässä lapset, jotka myös edustavat pelin pelaajakuntaa. Lapset ovat ideoineet pelimekaniikkoja ja useita otuksia olentopediaan sekä yksityiskohtia pelimaailmaan.
Pelisuunnittelussa on ollut tukena myös useita muita kotimaisia roolipelisuunnittelijoita, kuten Jukka Sorsa, Samuli Ahokas, Ville Takanen ja Jukka Särkijärvi. Lisäksi olemme saaneet korvaamatonta palautetta kymmeniltä Astraterran pelaajilta.
 
Kuvitus
Pelin kuvituksesta vastaa koko joukko lahjakkaita kuvittajia. Suurin osa kuvituksesta on Olli Hietalan, Olli Juutilaisen, Jari Paanasen, Hans Zenjugan, Simo Latvasen ja Oskari Wäänäsen aikaansaannosta.

Blogikirjoitus: Miksi kaksi kirjaa?

 
 

 Kaikkiin projekteihin sisältyy riskejä. Tämä on kuitenkin 10 vuoden aikana seitsemäs roolipelini ja kolmas Indiegogon kautta järjestettävä ennakkomyyntikampanjani, joten perusasiat alkavat olla aika hyvin hallussa. Olen kuitenkin tavallinen ihminen, jolla on perhe, päivätyöt (kyllä, roolipelien suunnittelu ja kustantaminen on minulle vain “harrastus” ;D ) sekä muita velvotteita, jotka saattavat sotkea suunnitelmat.
Teen kuitenkin parhaani, että tuote valmistuu ajallaan parhaalla mahdollisella laadulla valmistettuna ja toimitettuna. Ongelmatapauksien sattuessa tunnen useita lahjakkaita kuvittajia ja hyviä kirjoittajia, jotka voivat varmasti hädän hetkellä tarjota apuaan.

</div></div>","Ethnographic References are at the core of the worldbuilding - it’s philosophy, culture, and politics underlie the narrative of places, it’s characters and events. Ethnography lets you interpret and dive into the rich folklore and explore the underlying motives of the characters and their customs. With this book we aim to dig beyond the surface and explore roots and meanings of the pulsating worlds. 
Whether it is a clash of opposing philosophies, or a conflict between the  underrepresented society and the rulers, or maybe a decline of the ancient and the emergence of new technologies, this book provides inspiring narrative for exploration.
The book is made up from three chapters with specific theme: Branches of Philosophy, Facets of Culture, and Masters of Politics, each with three key parts: in-depth lore (including descriptions of cultural phenomena and events), detailed references (including 3d maps of places, drawings and cross sections) and campaign starters (including NPCs and quest hooks). Every chapters is exploring an essential step for the campaign worldbuilding, and provides references that can be used directly in your game, or provide you a sources for inspiration.


Ethnographic References for Fantasy Campaigns will be an 8.5"" x 11"" E-book, with full-colour pages and extra pages in the form of technical references and 3d art (containing print-ready high resolution maps and worldbuilding charts). As this is a reference book, the emphasis will be given on the quality of the detailed design of items and places.


 
Pages from the book © Craftmastery
The finished book will be approximately 100+ pages, although it could be longer depending on the crowdfunding success. The e-book will contain 3 campaign starters with adventure hooks, character backgrounds, ship designs, NPCs and more.

The woods have become too dangerous for the trappers who once caught animals for fur, and merchants no longer travel the poorly-maintained road.</p><p>What great evil and what fabulous treasures are to be found in these lands?

The village’s half-ruined temple of Law, dilapidated inn, drunken blacksmith, exiled trader and a few fur-trappers are enough to keep the bloody-minded denizens of the dark forest at bay, but nobody really expects the village to still be there in another ten years. The woods have become too dangerous for the trappers who once caught animals for fur, and merchants no longer travel the poorly-maintained road.What great evil and what fabulous treasures are to be found in these lands? A brave band of adventurers might make their fortunes here. Or perhaps they might never return … What's Inside?
A small village with map, key, and information for the characters to learn about the area
A wilderness map and key for outdoor adventures
A temple and underground complex with a dark mystery
A variety of new monsters
 COVID-19 Effect: The printing for this adventure is done by a family-owned shop in Arizona, where a shelter-in-place order is in effect, making us one of their largest customers. Sales like this also allow us to keep a stream of income moving to our freelance artists, authors, layout artists, and editors during the shut-downs. Frog God will come out of this crisis intact, so this isn't a ""keep the doors open"" plea, but we want to let you know that your purchase is one that you can feel comfortable about. It directly affects small businesses and households. We hope that all of you remain safe and well for the duration!The Project Frog God Games projects on Indiegogo are simple, focused, and short.
Short in duration (2-3 weeks)
Fast delivery of PDF once funding is completed
Limited to a single title
Have options priced between $5-$30
Stretch goals and project bonuses (if any) affect the principle reward only (usually both the PDF and the softcover).
Are the only guaranteed method to get the premium* print copy (NOTE: the softcover versions  in this printing will not be sold on our website: see FAQ for explanation).
Have a simple fulfillment process that does not use Backerkit
*Premium means heavyweight glossy interior pages enhancing the art and color elements. The  thick, glossy cardstock brings out the vibrant color of the cover illustration. These are the nicest softcover books we have ever sold and we only print a title this way once.Any reprint would use print on demand service that, although nice, do not approach the quality of our INDIEGOGO funded books. Why the Tiny Print Run?Since 2012 our crowdfunding approach has been extravagant in every way. Ambitious with massive page counts, plus numerous add-on options and stretch goals. All supporting a primary title itself as many as 990 pages.This has resulted in Kickstarter's with memorable pledge rewards that include top-quality hardcover books with sometimes dozens of stretch goal bonuses and add-on extras. These are awesome AND they are expensive to buy for customers like you because they are very expensive to make for publishers like us.Why not use Kickstarter?We will still be using Kickstarter, frequently, for our large-scale projects, but we hear the request for less expensive options for our products all the time, especially smaller, faster-paced adventures that can be completed in 2-3 sessions.Product enhancements tied to project success During the funding period for Lost Menagerie and after the funding goal is met we will  improve the delivered product based on additional sales. There are no special tiered collectors editions or add-on purchase extras. Thus, as total project funding increases, the better the final product will be for everybody.Examples of improvements made to earlier products:
Additional commissions for interior color art specific to the adventure. 
The previous Indiegogo project added an interior art piece and 2 extra creature illustrations for its appendix.
Downloadable Options designed for use with popular virtual table-top software (The rewards for both How Orcus Stole Christmas! and In Vino Gigantus included the new creature/NPC tokens and player maps). 
High-resolution files of illustrations to share with players at the table.
Project DeliveryPDF PerksWe will email the instructions to all eligible supporters with instructions on accessing PDF items. The PDF files are distributed using Constant Contact service and our web store. You will need to have a customer account on the Frog God Games website to get your PDF; it's how we keep track of everything and grants unlimited access by you to your reward.The Indiegogo perk PDF files are 'purchased' at zero cost by supporters (as they are paid for during the Indiegogo promotion) at the Frog God Games web store using a coupon code. That code we will be sent via Constant Contact to the address provided by Indiegogo. Please contact us with any questions/requests about this.Softcover PerksSoftcover perks will be mailed to the address provided by us via Indiegogo.  Overseas ShippingNOTE TO INTERNATIONAL BACKERS: Shipping international has become very expensive. We understand this. Likewise, some countries charge VAT tax or other fees to our customers on receipt. We cannot fraudulently lie about the value of materials we mail out. We are happy to ship you anything regardless of where you live, but we have to stay in business at the same time thus even our lightest books are affected. In the near future we expect to have a print on demand system in place for everyone overseas, It is not ideal, as the final book is not printed at the highest-quality when compared to the ones we fulfill in Indiegogo.To explain what we mean, please see the shipping calculator for UPS.",3.0,0,"21 Campaigns

<p>These Cool and Unique dice are made by machining around the edges of every side of the dice. Each side is machined to the depth where it intersects the other machined sides. By doing this the center is now able to float around and be separate from the outer cage.  The Aluminum dice are milled to shape and then anodized. That way the numbers and the floating feature machined into each side will show off the bare aluminum and give a really good contrast to the anodized surface!</p>

<h1>How to Add-on Additional Dice  </h1>
<p>I get asked a lot about how you can order more than one set of dice. Indiegogo only allows you to select one reward but you can increase your pledge amount to include an extra award, or two, or three, or etc. Then you can select what you ordered through the Backerkit system. </p>
<p> <b>Please note that Early Bird Levels can not be an Add-On.</b> </p>
<p> When you are pledging and choosing your reward please choose the highest reward level 1st then increase your pledge by the amount of the lower pledge level(s) that you want to add-on. </p>
<p> International backers because these dice are basically heavy chunks of metal so an extra $5 international shipping charges will be applied in Backerkit for every add-on you order. </p>
<p> You can add these additional funds through Indiegogo or you can add additional funds to your order through Backerkit to pre-order more dice than what is offered in just one selected reward level.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>My name is Nastya, and I am the owner of <a href=""http://tiny-furniture.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tiny Furniture Store</a>. I'm passionate about creating, manufacturing and painting miniature accessories for tabletop games.</p>
<p>In addition to “Warhammer”, “Dungeons and Dragons” and “Frostgrave”, I really love computer games from the Fallout series and for a long time I dreamed of creating new miniatures in a post-apocalyptic - retro - futuristic style. That's why I decided to run a crowdfunding project and asking you for support.</p>
<p>My friends from  “MyWayMiniatures” company already developed 3-D models of 15 miniatures: computer panels, racks, desktop consoles, garbage cans and others. The entire set of models you can see in the description of the project below.</p>
<p>All these models will be printed on a high-quality industrial printer, and then cast in resin.</p>
<p>We have been professionally casting miniatures for a 2 year period. We have a workshop, pressure chambers, pumps and high-quality materials. We are deeply committed to ensuring miniatures that each client buys are the best quality.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
</div><div>
<p>3-d sculpting and specially 3-d printing in the best quality is very expensive. The total cost of one finished master-model is about $200-$300. That's why I need your support, folks. Without you, it will take me about one year to produce all of these miniatures. </p>
<p>To this day we have sculpted, print and cast the Grocery Stand miniature to give you a taste of the game visuals. If the campaign will be successfully funded, we will produce more according to the plan below.</p>
<p>We aim to provide not just decorative items, but highly functional tools to help people enhance their hobby experience in a multitude of ways.</p>

<p>The small village of Teganhsire is in disarray as the workers sent to repair the bridge never came back to town, and rumors spread that a monster has killed them all. Hired PCs investigate the situation, but find themselves thrown into a maelstrom of druidic intrigue and repercussions of an old feud between the village and forest spirits.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593644178/emvkjtysgnfg2i84xqjc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Burials of Teganshire is a module for level 1-3 characters that can be used in any campaign setting (commercial or homebrew). It is the first module of the <strong>Circle of the Blood Moon</strong> adventure path that will take characters to level 10, through a long campaign filled with complex encounters and ancient mysteries. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>A few things that are important to us in the design of this adventure:</p>
<p><strong>Campaign Setting Agnostic.</strong> We wanted to propose a module that can be inserted in any campaign world. <strong><i>The Kingdom of Lothmar</i> </strong>is our own setting, and in the appendix of the module, we provide guidance on how to play this adventure in this setting.

First off the action of the module is local, it spans an area of about 15 miles wide, that you can easily plug into your preferred setting. Also, we made sure to strip any lore or NPC behavior that would not be applicable to most settings, offering the possibility to play it as it is, or DMs to add their custom lore-specific content to their liking.</p>
<p><strong>Heroic Story Centric</strong>. We want players to feel like heroes. Our modules are tough and complex because players do not like to feel their progression is undeserved. Nothing beats a party of players cheering at each other after a tough battle. We also believe that actions should have consequences and our modules include many different possible endings based on how the players behaved. Compelling stories are supported by motivated and plausible NPCs. We have designed this module so that every NPC's motivations and perspectives are described, giving DMs the tools to bring the environment to life.</p>

<p>Griffon Lore Games was started by Christophe and Anthony about two years ago, though this is our first IndieGogo campaign.

<p>Christophe was born in France and has lived in the US for the last 15 years. He started RPGs with the D&amp;D Red Box, played a lot of 2E and ran years-long campaigns in Ars Magica and Vampire as well.</p>
<p>Anthony grew up in Washington State, and played all editions of D&amp;D. He remains locally famous for DMing his 20+ years D&amp;D campaign in the Greyhawk setting.</p>

<p>This module comes with <i>maps-you-can-play-with.</i> Our maps are not only meant to be fancy illustrations for the book. They are immersive tools for players and DMs to use. The maps presented in the module are of small enough scale that, again, you can plug them in any world you want to use. We think of maps as story generators: when characters need to travel from one locale to another, a rich and detailed map turns that journey into an adventure.</p>

<p>Addon products and freebies to the module will include <strong>Map Packs</strong> that will provide high-resolution files for the maps so you print them and/or use them on VTT platforms. Anna Meyer authored all the maps for the campaign setting.

<h4><strong>Why Indiegogo?</strong></h4>
<p>This is our first campaign on Indiegogo - but not our first crowd-funding campaign. We have been looking at Indiegogo for a while. From our perspective, its one of the remaining platforms that stayed true to the original purpose of crowd-funding: get guys like us in contact with folks like you and enable our ideas and projects to come to life. It has been a frustrating journey on other platforms that turned into marketplaces and online stores where large companies come to score high sales numbers and leave crumbs for the Indie publications.</p>
<p>We hope this campaign is the first of many as we bring the collection to life. We aim for these campaigns to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only run for a couple weeks</li>
<li>Have options priced between $5 and $30</li>
<li>Flexible goals so you know the campaign is a go whatever happens</li>
<li>We seek to cover our costs - if the campaign should get funded beyond our goal, this money will go towards improving the product and help finance the products to come. We will find our profit as a company outside of IndieGogo.</li>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","The road through Tegan's Bridge is not safe anymore.
The small village of Teganhsire is in disarray as the workers sent to repair the bridge never came back to town, and rumors spread that a monster has killed them all. Hired PCs investigate the situation, but find themselves thrown into a maelstrom of druidic intrigue and repercussions of an old feud between the village and forest spirits.

Burials of Teganshire is a module for level 1-3 characters that can be used in any campaign setting (commercial or homebrew). It is the first module of the Circle of the Blood Moon adventure path that will take characters to level 10, through a long campaign filled with complex encounters and ancient mysteries. 
 
A few things that are important to us in the design of this adventure:
Campaign Setting Agnostic. We wanted to propose a module that can be inserted in any campaign world. The Kingdom of Lothmar is our own setting, and in the appendix of the module, we provide guidance on how to play this adventure in this setting. However, we designed it so that if you want to play the module in your own setting, you totally can. How do we achieve that? First off the action of the module is local, it spans an area of about 15 miles wide, that you can easily plug into your preferred setting. Also, we made sure to strip any lore or NPC behavior that would not be applicable to most settings, offering the possibility to play it as it is, or DMs to add their custom lore-specific content to their liking.
Heroic Story Centric. We want players to feel like heroes. Our modules are tough and complex because players do not like to feel their progression is undeserved. Nothing beats a party of players cheering at each other after a tough battle. We also believe that actions should have consequences and our modules include many different possible endings based on how the players behaved.

He dresses in the traditional garb of the magically inclined, favouring long flowing robes that match his long flowing beard. Often, he is seen wearing a pointy hat, which is purple and adorned with silver stars. While other wizards may scoff at his choice of attire, Humbert revels in it, feeling that it gives him an air of classic representation.</p><p>Humbert was once considered a wise scholar, but years of arcane invocations have left somewhat of a mark on his mind. After a magical incident, Humbert has been suspended from his chair at the local magical university (""But I'm still a professor, dammit!""). Humbert’s peers agree that his incompetence makes him an embarrassment, but he is so oblivious that many consider him blameless. </p><p>Humbert makes friends with nearly everyone he meets, seemingly having lost the ability to be cautious long ago (likely due to an early magical mishap). Humbert often barrels forward with delight, leading him to become (for better or worse) the center of attention at cocktail parties. Regardless of the latest mishap, he pursues his magical research with reckless abandon and rushes towards with his latest (and greatest!) discovery. He fails to consider that the common element in every disaster is himself. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1552264931/vkxdisiwoe5hncv6lxvk.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Want to get your hands on one of the adventures in the Codex? <a href=""https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/263661/Oh-I-Hate-Spiders--A-short-5e-adventure"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Check out Oh, I Hate Spiders!, available free over at DriveThruRPG</a></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553088796/r0ypn2wi17lnsnelc2kh.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Oh, I Hate Spiders! is a 2-hour 5e OGL adventure, suitable for 3-5 characters at 3rd level.

He leans hard into the familiar fantasy tropes, and he brings along his special brand of kooky arcane accidents and unrelenting eldritch errors. You can use him to provide comic relief between major adventures, or to introduce your own quest hooks and plot points.The finished Codex will be approximately 80+ pages in a 5.5 by 8.5 inch format. It will contain 10 short adventures, a character write up, statblocks, magic items, and more! The Codex is fully written and has seen a first round of editing. Illustrations have also been secured, using some top-notch artists from both in and outside the industry. Playtesting is ongoing, and we're looking forward to trying everything at the table before it's delivered to you.Professor Humbert Drumsley is an aging wizard who is confined largely to his tower and estate. He dresses in the traditional garb of the magically inclined, favouring long flowing robes that match his long flowing beard. Often, he is seen wearing a pointy hat, which is purple and adorned with silver stars. While other wizards may scoff at his choice of attire, Humbert revels in it, feeling that it gives him an air of classic representation.Humbert was once considered a wise scholar, but years of arcane invocations have left somewhat of a mark on his mind. After a magical incident, Humbert has been suspended from his chair at the local magical university (""But I'm still a professor, dammit!""). Humbert’s peers agree that his incompetence makes him an embarrassment, but he is so oblivious that many consider him blameless. Humbert makes friends with nearly everyone he meets, seemingly having lost the ability to be cautious long ago (likely due to an early magical mishap). Humbert often barrels forward with delight, leading him to become (for better or worse) the center of attention at cocktail parties. Regardless of the latest mishap, he pursues his magical research with reckless abandon and rushes towards with his latest (and greatest!) discovery. He fails to consider that the common element in every disaster is himself. Want to get your hands on one of the adventures in the Codex? Check out Oh, I Hate Spiders!, available free over at DriveThruRPGOh, I Hate Spiders! is a 2-hour 5e OGL adventure, suitable for 3-5 characters at 3rd level.

Ok fine, just one more time!Humbert was studying a sac of phase spider eggs in the basement of a local tavern, when he suddenly had to abandon his research. Because they were about to hatch. But don't worry, he didn't tell anyone. Probably everything is just fine, these things have a way of working themselves out. Well, now the entire place is infested, the tavern is empty, and the building is filled with ethereal fog!""Just bring back a few live specimens,"" he says. ""It'll be easy,"" he says. Humbert.

<p>Act 2: Ha'Ot - the Undergrowth Birth of the Blight Root</p>
<p>In this campaign, we descend into the rooted cave system of the Undergrowth.</p>
<p>The Undergrowth is an all but forgotten cave system that is now entrenched with corrupted roots from the Ironwood forest above.  </p> <p>This project was successful on Kickstarter and now we are using the Indiegogo InDemand feature to  offer packages </p> <p><strong><i>Story Prologue -</i></strong></p>
<p>The journey begins with our adventurers who were commissioned with an assignment from Leordric, Lord of the Ironwood Citadel.  The adventurers were given four tasks.  First, find the source that caused the corruption in the Ironwood Forest.  Second, interview an order of Druids who's dark practices have recently been outlawed.  Third, search for a hermit named Olson J. Sapson whom fled justice after committing a despicable crime.  Fourth, if the rumors are true, find and exterminate the hag in the forest.   </p>
<p>The order of Druids were easy to track down.  When encountering a handful of them they spoke plainly at first.  It certainly appeared there was a sense of fear among some of them.  When the conversation ended and the members of the order of Druids dispersed, the last member to leave looked back at the adventurers and whispered a riddle in a cold voice ""look for the mark, the cave under the tree, under the tree... is corruption"".</p>
<p>While searching the expansive Ironwood forest for over 3 moons, the adventurers found a barren cottage. Cumulative evidence framed the picture that Olson J. Sapson dwelled there.  Yet, Olson was no where to be found.  Much of Olson's belongings are still in the cottage including some exquisite valuables.  The adventurers were careful not disturb or to take anything from the cottage, but did set up hidden markers in and around the cottage parameters.  These indicators would serve to identify if Olson was still occupying the residence. </p>
<p>The adventurers continued deeper into the Ironwood Forest and the corruption was unmistakably thick.  It was, as if, they were in a darkness... that could be felt.  It was just then a second cottage was spotted, but this time the chattering of children could be heard.  The adventurers were not deceived by the voices...  the Hag had spotted them.  Knowing they were being watched by the Hag, they planned a trap to trap their trapper.  All things come to pass and the Hag... was no more.</p>
<p>The darkness in the Ironwood Forest diminished only but a little.  They continued and the adventurers remembered the cold words of the last Druid.  So they continued to search... and search... </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1557543008/heokl6fbr6ozmo02cm7q.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong><i>the Undergrowth Story Begins -</i></strong></p>
<p>In the space of the fourth moon the adventurers found something unmistakable.  A tree so grotesque that all the trees around it seems to have moved away.  This beastly tree had ripped the ground open, enlarging the mouth of a mysterious cave for all to see.  The cave's mouth is now part of the tree and the tree opened its mouth to anyone brave enough to enter.</p>
<p>The adventurers investigate the opening before entering.  A glowing low lit light pierces the darkness inside the cave.  Holding onto roots and stepping into the muddy foundation the adventurers feet quickly meet solid ground.  A formation of stones suspended and held together by roots nearly create a half circle around a pool of water.  Careful not to disturb the water the party moves into a cave system.</p>
<p>Immediately the adventurers find several ancient runic pillars and the adventurers contemplate the lore of the Na'Hash.   It is said that an ancient reptilian race known as the Na'Hash built a cave system in these very parts in the beginnings of creation.  Until the corruption of the Ironwood forest this very cave system and the Na'Hash were considered a myth.  </p>
<p>Just then the adventurers notice something ever so slightly move in the midst of the roots.  ""What is it?"" an adventurer whispered.   Holding very still the adventurers plan their next steps. Carefully approaching the roots the adventurers find themselves surrounded by roots.  The roots with all their twist and turns made it very difficult to notice at first.  Once the adventurers eyes locked on the eyes of the Blight Root creature they quickly reacted before the creature could entangle them.</p>
<p>The adventures now believe they understand the riddle of the Druids.  They believe the Druids didn't cause the corruption but when they found the sanctuary they saw the opportunity to create the Blight Root creatures.   The lord over these lands was right to want to put a stop to this dark order of Druids.</p>

<p><strong>Act 2: the Undergrowth Birth of the Blight Root </strong><br/>In this campaign, we are introducing an all new set of terrain.  We are officially releasing our new Jericho Wall System [edges], Undergrowth root floors, Multi-Level terrain, Multi-Level cave system, Sanctuary root floors, Sanctuary Pillars &amp; Altar, corrupted grotesque tree, mushroom creature, Purple Musk Vine and Blight Root creatures!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1557543516/kc5epbr7tvlgbnx9am1o.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Jericho Wall System - Rises the floors, lowers the walls and increases thematic experience</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1557543538/r86lasheapjua3ddz8vk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Jericho Wall System - </strong><br/>This is our vision on how we increase the visual theme and lower the exterior floor walls.  Terrain floor walls looks amazing yet sometimes they get in the way visually.  Our Jericho Wall System decreases the wall height then lowers the walls under the floor.  By doing this we increase viability and expand the immersive themed appearance.  We carve deeper into the wall system making very unique looking edge walls.   This method also raises the floors off the gaming table and it looks fantastic!</p>
<p>One of the things we contemplated for a long time was ways to make pools of water at the floor level and below.   We didn’t want water effects like nail polish simply brushed over the top surface of a floor tile [which is fine in most cases].  We wanted depths of water similar to our Water Feature Collection.  </p>
<p><strong><i>It really wasn’t possible, until now. </i> </strong></p>
<p>Thanks to our Jericho Wall system it's now possible to add a pools of water at the floor level with the depth of the pool below the surface of the floor.  The Jericho Wall system also made it possible to create a pit trap below the floor surface as well.  Check out the pit trap in our opening Undergrowth video.  </p>
<p>These are just a couple more examples why we designed our Jericho Wall system.  Opening the realm of possibilities.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Multi-Level Terrain - </strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1557674012/oedirakfvlkujodrrfbu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>DM ""Climbing up Multi-Level Terrain requires a Dexterity check""</i></p>
<p>We are also introducing Multi-Level terrain where players and NPC's can climb up the terrain and find another playable surface.  The top surface of the terrain could be used to create an upper path.  Stack two piece and gain even more height or perhaps the path may lead to another level in the cave system.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Multi-Level Cave System -</strong></h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1557543925/i3kwbfdoq0dfsyzwb6pb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Root Pillars are stackable</i></p>
<p><br/>It just keeps growing!  We are also introducing our Root Pillars which connect to our Mystic-Lock bases.  Root Pillars create the opportunity to make upper cave rooms and passages.  DM's at any time can increase the size of the Undergrowth by simply making an upper expansion.  The upper expansion can easily be added to the table or removed when not in use.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>
<strong>The Sanctuary -</strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1557544050/nfdqf37wlnfescy5rmfs.jpg"" src=""""/>

<p><br/>The sanctuary floors, pillar and altar are overgrown with corrupted roots that seem to be alive. This is the center where the first Blight Root was birthed.</p>

<p><br/>NEW CREATURES!  Those vile Druids birthed unnatural creatures from the roots of the Ironwood Forest.  The perfect creature for this adventure.  They blend into the environment and characters climbing up Multi-Level terrain might be in for a surprise when they mistakenly grab part of a living creature.  The Blight creatures also include the grotesque tree, monstrosity mushroom and an interesting mushroom that exploded and a Purple Musk Vine is growing out of it.</p>
<p><strong>Purple Musk Vine -</strong><br/>The Purple Musk Vine usually have some sort of adventure equipment and or treasure near or within it.</p>
<p>The Purple Musk Vine latches onto creatures that comes into range [5 feet] and inject them with a brain eating serum.  At the beginning of the victims round a successful strength save of 15 must be made to break free from the grasp.  A constitution save of 15 also must be rolled each round [even after breaking free] or suffer the consequences of the injected brain eating serum.  Even if a victim broke the grasp in the first round this constitution save must be rolled each round until a successful constitution save is made. The injected serum loaded with microbial seed eat 1 intel point per round for each failed constitution save.  </p>
<p>If the victim reaches 0 intel it is permanently transformed into a Purple Musk Bondservant [NPC] for the reminder of its now shortened miserable life.  When the Purple Musk Bondservant dies a new Purple Musk Vine will grow from its corpse.  The corpse and all of its gear set the trap for the next set of creatures attempting collect the armor, weapons and treasure left behind.</p>
<p>There is no cure to recover diminished intelligence point.</p>
<p>The heart of a Purple Musk Vine is a large 1-2 foot bulb [AC12] that sits 1 foot somewhere under the surface of the creature.  The bulb has 4 health points.   Purple Musk Vines can be cut [AC12] but any attached vines will continue grasping onto their victim for 1d4+1 rounds or if a strength saves is successful.  Anyone attempting to pull off a vine must also make the strength and constitution saves as the vine will quickly grab anything touching it.</p>
<p><strong>Purple Musk Bondservant -</strong><br/>Purple Musk Bondservants retains the AC of its former self and lives 1d4 hours before it appears to die on its own.  The eyes of a freshly turned Purple Musk Bondservant will become full of red veins and random visible flesh areas will move like worms are just under the surface of the flesh.  </p>
<p>Aside from wondering behind its former party this creature has no memory of its past life, can only speak gibberish and is functioning as a botanical reproduction host.  During its short life it will continuously attempt two mindless tactics.  The Purple Musk Bondservant will try to lure other creatures into the grasp of a nearby Purple Musk Vine or stare mindlessly into the eyes of another creature giving the impression it needs help.  It will appear completely hopeless.  </p>
<p>Just before death the Purple Musk Bondservants will lay down on its back, its eyes will turn completely black before liquifying, its skin will crack and curl away and it will attempt to die in the presence of creatures trying to help it.  While this is taking place a bulb forming off the lower back of the Purple Musk Bondservant will bury into the ground so new life can spring forth.</p>
<p>Upon death, a new Purple Musk Vine shoots forth from the corpse of the Purple Musk Bondservant grasping all creatures with in range [5 feet].  </p>
<p>If the Purple Musk Bondservant is killed by a creature before it dies on its own the new internal Purple Musk Vine will be premature. Premature Purple Musk Vines will not reveal themselves and are not be able to grasp near by victims until the Purple Musk Vine has completed its full term [remaining hours] and its bulb is buried.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Mystic-Lock v3 - </strong></h3>

</div><p> </p></div>","Act 2: Ha'Ot - the Undergrowth Birth of the Blight Root
In this campaign, we descend into the rooted cave system of the Undergrowth.
The Undergrowth is an all but forgotten cave system that is now entrenched with corrupted roots from the Ironwood forest above.   This project was successful on Kickstarter and now we are using the Indiegogo InDemand feature to  offer packages  Story Prologue -
The journey begins with our adventurers who were commissioned with an assignment from Leordric, Lord of the Ironwood Citadel.  The adventurers were given four tasks.  First, find the source that caused the corruption in the Ironwood Forest.  Second, interview an order of Druids who's dark practices have recently been outlawed.  Third, search for a hermit named Olson J. Sapson whom fled justice after committing a despicable crime.  Fourth, if the rumors are true, find and exterminate the hag in the forest.   
The order of Druids were easy to track down.  When encountering a handful of them they spoke plainly at first.  It certainly appeared there was a sense of fear among some of them.  When the conversation ended and the members of the order of Druids dispersed, the last member to leave looked back at the adventurers and whispered a riddle in a cold voice ""look for the mark, the cave under the tree, under the tree... is corruption"".
While searching the expansive Ironwood forest for over 3 moons, the adventurers found a barren cottage. Cumulative evidence framed the picture that Olson J. Sapson dwelled there.  Yet, Olson was no where to be found.  Much of Olson's belongings are still in the cottage including some exquisite valuables.  The adventurers were careful not disturb or to take anything from the cottage, but did set up hidden markers in and around the cottage parameters.  These indicators would serve to identify if Olson was still occupying the residence. 
The adventurers continued deeper into the Ironwood Forest and the corruption was unmistakably thick.  It was, as if, they were in a darkness... that could be felt.  It was just then a second cottage was spotted, but this time the chattering of children could be heard.  The adventurers were not deceived by the voices...  the Hag had spotted them.  Knowing they were being watched by the Hag, they planned a trap to trap their trapper.  All things come to pass and the Hag... was no more.
The darkness in the Ironwood Forest diminished only but a little.  They continued and the adventurers remembered the cold words of the last Druid.  So they continued to search... and search... 

the Undergrowth Story Begins -
In the space of the fourth moon the adventurers found something unmistakable.  A tree so grotesque that all the trees around it seems to have moved away.  This beastly tree had ripped the ground open, enlarging the mouth of a mysterious cave for all to see.  The cave's mouth is now part of the tree and the tree opened its mouth to anyone brave enough to enter.
The adventurers investigate the opening before entering.  A glowing low lit light pierces the darkness inside the cave.  Holding onto roots and stepping into the muddy foundation the adventurers feet quickly meet solid ground.  A formation of stones suspended and held together by roots nearly create a half circle around a pool of water.  Careful not to disturb the water the party moves into a cave system.
Immediately the adventurers find several ancient runic pillars and the adventurers contemplate the lore of the Na'Hash.   It is said that an ancient reptilian race known as the Na'Hash built a cave system in these very parts in the beginnings of creation.  Until the corruption of the Ironwood forest this very cave system and the Na'Hash were considered a myth.  
Just then the adventurers notice something ever so slightly move in the midst of the roots.  ""What is it?"" an adventurer whispered.   Holding very still the adventurers plan their next steps. Carefully approaching the roots the adventurers find themselves surrounded by roots.  The roots with all their twist and turns made it very difficult to notice at first.  Once the adventurers eyes locked on the eyes of the Blight Root creature they quickly reacted before the creature could entangle them.
The adventures now believe they understand the riddle of the Druids.  They believe the Druids didn't cause the corruption but when they found the sanctuary they saw the opportunity to create the Blight Root creatures.   The lord over these lands was right to want to put a stop to this dark order of Druids.
 
Our Ideas and Innovations

 
Act 2: the Undergrowth Birth of the Blight Root In this campaign, we are introducing an all new set of terrain.  We are officially releasing our new Jericho Wall System [edges], Undergrowth root floors, Multi-Level terrain, Multi-Level cave system, Sanctuary root floors, Sanctuary Pillars & Altar, corrupted grotesque tree, mushroom creature, Purple Musk Vine and Blight Root creatures!
 

Jericho Wall System - Rises the floors, lowers the walls and increases thematic experience

 
Jericho Wall System - This is our vision on how we increase the visual theme and lower the exterior floor walls.  Terrain floor walls looks amazing yet sometimes they get in the way visually.  Our Jericho Wall System decreases the wall height then lowers the walls under the floor.  By doing this we increase viability and expand the immersive themed appearance.  We carve deeper into the wall system making very unique looking edge walls.   This method also raises the floors off the gaming table and it looks fantastic!
One of the things we contemplated for a long time was ways to make pools of water at the floor level and below.   We didn’t want water effects like nail polish simply brushed over the top surface of a floor tile [which is fine in most cases].  We wanted depths of water similar to our Water Feature Collection.  
It really wasn’t possible, until now.  
Thanks to our Jericho Wall system it's now possible to add a pools of water at the floor level with the depth of the pool below the surface of the floor.  The Jericho Wall system also made it possible to create a pit trap below the floor surface as well.  Check out the pit trap in our opening Undergrowth video.  
These are just a couple more examples why we designed our Jericho Wall system.  Opening the realm of possibilities.
 
Multi-Level Terrain - 

DM ""Climbing up Multi-Level Terrain requires a Dexterity check""
We are also introducing Multi-Level terrain where players and NPC's can climb up the terrain and find another playable surface.  The top surface of the terrain could be used to create an upper path.  Stack two piece and gain even more height or perhaps the path may lead to another level in the cave system.
 
Multi-Level Cave System -

Root Pillars are stackable
It just keeps growing!  We are also introducing our Root Pillars which connect to our Mystic-Lock bases.  Root Pillars create the opportunity to make upper cave rooms and passages.  DM's at any time can increase the size of the Undergrowth by simply making an upper expansion.  The upper expansion can easily be added to the table or removed when not in use.  
 

The Sanctuary -

The sanctuary floors, pillar and altar are overgrown with corrupted roots that seem to be alive. This is the center where the first Blight Root was birthed.
 
Blight Root & Creatures - 


NEW CREATURES!  Those vile Druids birthed unnatural creatures from the roots of the Ironwood Forest.  The perfect creature for this adventure.  They blend into the environment and characters climbing up Multi-Level terrain might be in for a surprise when they mistakenly grab part of a living creature.  The Blight creatures also include the grotesque tree, monstrosity mushroom and an interesting mushroom that exploded and a Purple Musk Vine is growing out of it.
Purple Musk Vine -The Purple Musk Vine usually have some sort of adventure equipment and or treasure near or within it.
The Purple Musk Vine latches onto creatures that comes into range [5 feet] and inject them with a brain eating serum.  At the beginning of the victims round a successful strength save of 15 must be made to break free from the grasp.  A constitution save of 15 also must be rolled each round [even after breaking free] or suffer the consequences of the injected brain eating serum.  Even if a victim broke the grasp in the first round this constitution save must be rolled each round until a successful constitution save is made. The injected serum loaded with microbial seed eat 1 intel point per round for each failed constitution save.  
If the victim reaches 0 intel it is permanently transformed into a Purple Musk Bondservant [NPC] for the reminder of its now shortened miserable life.  When the Purple Musk Bondservant dies a new Purple Musk Vine will grow from its corpse.  The corpse and all of its gear set the trap for the next set of creatures attempting collect the armor, weapons and treasure left behind.
There is no cure to recover diminished intelligence point.
The heart of a Purple Musk Vine is a large 1-2 foot bulb [AC12] that sits 1 foot somewhere under the surface of the creature.  The bulb has 4 health points.   Purple Musk Vines can be cut [AC12] but any attached vines will continue grasping onto their victim for 1d4+1 rounds or if a strength saves is successful.  Anyone attempting to pull off a vine must also make the strength and constitution saves as the vine will quickly grab anything touching it.
Purple Musk Bondservant -Purple Musk Bondservants retains the AC of its former self and lives 1d4 hours before it appears to die on its own.  The eyes of a freshly turned Purple Musk Bondservant will become full of red veins and random visible flesh areas will move like worms are just under the surface of the flesh.  
Aside from wondering behind its former party this creature has no memory of its past life, can only speak gibberish and is functioning as a botanical reproduction host.  During its short life it will continuously attempt two mindless tactics.  The Purple Musk Bondservant will try to lure other creatures into the grasp of a nearby Purple Musk Vine or stare mindlessly into the eyes of another creature giving the impression it needs help.  It will appear completely hopeless.  
Just before death the Purple Musk Bondservants will lay down on its back, its eyes will turn completely black before liquifying, its skin will crack and curl away and it will attempt to die in the presence of creatures trying to help it.  While this is taking place a bulb forming off the lower back of the Purple Musk Bondservant will bury into the ground so new life can spring forth.
Upon death, a new Purple Musk Vine shoots forth from the corpse of the Purple Musk Bondservant grasping all creatures with in range [5 feet].  
If the Purple Musk Bondservant is killed by a creature before it dies on its own the new internal Purple Musk Vine will be premature. Premature Purple Musk Vines will not reveal themselves and are not be able to grasp near by victims until the Purple Musk Vine has completed its full term [remaining hours] and its bulb is buried.
 
Mystic-Lock v3 - 

Our Mystic-Lock is OpenLOCK compatible.  The system has a circular top connection to allow different texture top to be attached to the Mystic-Lock.  This means you can use our Grass Tile Collection from the Ironwood Forest or the Undergrowth floor tile to mount to the very same Mystic-Lock bases.  This will save plastic and time because once we have enough bases printed we only need to print texture tops to match the realm we are playing.  
NEW Version 3 has eight slots for our LED system*.  This means our new Undergrowth floor tile with brazier can be lit up!   It also means when the floor is raised up via Root Pillars LED's can be inserted upside down casting light onto the terrain below!

We live for our board games and we are passionate about modelling and creating new things for the table-top. We have always enjoyed bringing the table-top to life through battle maps and scenery. </p><p>Some of you will already know who we are and what we do. But for those of you who are new to the DMB train, I’ll explain, no wait we don't have enough time for that I’ll just sum up!</p><p>Two years ago, I started a little company making 3D terrain for D&amp;D games. I saw what was out there and it didn't quite fit what i wanted, so I started making my own. It's proved popular enough for me to give up working in IT full time and to make it my main job, that is down to everyone who has purchased the tiles up to this point, and I can't thank you enough!</p><p>Now I can expand the range and the company but I need your help to do so. There are some exciting things ahead, let’s get them released!</p><h3><strong>What's the story, and why do I need help?</strong></h3><p>Well to lay my cards on the table as it where, I need some help to raise money to expand the company and get it to the next stage, which is quite an exciting step for me.</p><p>There are two things I want to achieve from this campaign:</p><ol>
<li>Release new tiles, including some brand-new ranges as well as accessories and tiles for our existing ranges.</li>
<li>Expand the company to include other members of staff and a new workshop to help with promotion, production and all the other tasks I currently do myself.</li>
<li>Revamp the website and improve the photography that is on it now.</li>
</ol><p>O.K. so that is three things, but the third one was an afterthought and would only be considered if the campaign was very successful.</p><p>I have poured not only money in to the business to get the original molds, the silicone, get us to shows, and the packaging, but my heart and soul into making a product that is great to look at but is also practical and usable for gaming, which at the end of the day is what it is all about.</p><h3><strong>What are we offering you if you decide to support us?</strong></h3><p>We have several Pledge Levels for you guys to chip in on if you would like to. if you look on the Right hand of your screen - That's it just over there... you will see a list of campaign cards. They tell you everything you can get for your pledge levels. I'll also post a pictographic thing down the page a bit that shows you what you will be getting as well.  </p><p>But as an overview there are two things you'll get:</p><ol>
<li>Access to our existing range at a reduced cost</li>
<li>Access to new range as its unlocked throughout the campaign at the same reduced cost.</li>
<li>Some cool free DMB Goodies along the way</li>
</ol><p>Ok again I know that's 3 things again... but mugs, dice bags, game bags and other paraphernalia don’t count...</p><p>Here is a list of the rewards and the pictographic thing I promised showing what you can get, and what our first set of stretch goals are:</p><h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Perks</strong></h2><p>The following is a list of the Perks currently available to you on the campaign.</p><h3>£1+ - Show Us Your Support! </h3><p>At this level, you can pledge however much you want to support us expand our scenery range, but won't actually receive anything other than our heartfelt thanks, and a mention on our website!</p><h3>£20 - Accessory Pack</h3><p>This perk will get you 20 pieces of scatter scenery.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481025042/dp1uxvhwdlfv4esddksp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>You will receive a choice of 4 sets each containing 5 pieces of scatter sceenry.

<li>All Tile masters are hand made from Hirst Arts molds (we are fully licenced) and then cast in to solid pieces using silicone mold, for strength and ease of use.</li>
<li>Each piece you receive is:<ul>
<li>Hand Cast</li>
<li>Hand Painted</li>
<li>Hand finished</li>
<li>Hand Packed</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You can pick from the color variations we do, if you don't want grey then don't have it grey!</li>
<li>You can pick from any tile or Wall finish that we currently have or that is unlocked as we go through the campaign</li>
</ul><h3><strong>What are you going to use the Money for?</strong></h3><p>Well, that’s a great question, and here is how I see it working.</p><p>First and foremost, I am going to buy as much RTV Silicone as I can. We use this to make the molds that we cast from, and with so many new floor tiles, and accessory sets that we want to release we are going to need a lot of it.</p><p>5Kg of Silicone costs about £90 and the amount of molds we can get out of one box varies depending upon the size of the molds.</p><p>We can roughly produce one core set out of 2 box’s Silicone. So, for every 2 “Core set” pledged on this campaign will see the equivalent of a new set of floor tiles &amp; wall tiles produced.</p><p>Obviously on top of that we have the cost of the plaster and the packaging but you get the idea.</p><p>I have a list of nearly 70 Accessory sets I’d like to get in to production, and then there are the completely new sets, the Tavern, the Sci-fi, The sewers and the Wilderness sets.</p><p>The Accessory sets would benefit from being made from resin, so that would be an additional expense, and we would need to procure a vacuum chamber to ensure there are no bubbles.</p><p>We also currently have a 3D printer sitting in the corner of the office gathering dust so who know what we could do with that as we progress.</p><p>There are then some new tiles that should have been launched ages ago that feature in the video at the top of the page, the patterned and runic ones. Then we have wooden floors and cobblestone floors to release.</p><p>Moreover, there are special tiles I want to create, cavern tiles with resin lake pieces, so many pieces, we have over 300 new tiles in our list of tiles waiting to be created and produced.</p><p>Then there are room and corridor sets that we want to produce like the Arched hall way and the Chapel.</p><p>All of that is a lot of work for one person, and will require a larger work space, so this is where I need you guys to dig as deep as you can.</p><p>If we can hit £1000 the extra money raised will go on kitting out my garage as a work space. I need to buy worktops, shelving and flooring to go in there.</p><p>The Garage is large enough for me to get three people working in there, and will stop me having to spray paint in the back garden on the garden furniture!</p><p>It means we can get properly organised, have space for stock to be stored so it’s ready to ship when people order it and to enable us to prepare for shows in an easier fashion.</p><p>And if the campaign reaches the £5,000 I will be able to hire a part time assistant to help me cast and paint, allowing me to produce new pieces with more regularity, and work on the website as well.</p><h3><strong>What if we can’t contribute?</strong></h3><p>I understand not everyone will be able to pledge the money for a core set, but there are a few lower level pledges that you can pledge on, and if you can’t do that, then any think you can do to help spread the word would be greatly appreciated.</p><ul>
<li>Share the link on social media</li>
<li>email friends and colleagues</li>
<li>Talk about the campaign at your local games cub/school/pub</li>
<li>Hire a plane to skywrite the info so everyone in your neighbourhood can see it</li>
</ul><p>Ok maybe not the last one but you get the idea, any way you can share the campaign and raise awareness is excellent.</p><h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3><p>There are always risks to any project, especially one where everything is hand made, but we have spent 2 years mitigating what we can, where we can.</p><p>I have chosen to go with the flexible funding on the campaign, which means, if you pledge you will receive something, <strong>EVEN IF WE ARE NOT FULLY FUNDED!</strong></p><p>So, you don’t have to worry about that, you’ll get your pledge no matter what happens.</p><ul>
<li>
<strong>Current Product Range</strong><ul><li>We have all the moulds for our current sets, and the space to churn them out and paint them, as we need to. We have all the Hirst arts moulds we need to make the new sets, as well as the licence from Bruce to enable us to do so.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Resin Casting</strong><ul><li>The resin piece is new, but I have access to people who have used resin and vacuum chambers before, so that shouldn’t be a problem.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Casting Time</strong><ul><li>Hand Casting everything can be a long process. We will mitigate this by producing out standard stock as the campaign progresses, and then the new unlocked pieces at the end, so we should be able to cover everything that everyone wants easily.<br/><br/>The only thing that could affect the dispatch of the tiles at the end of the campaign is if everyone wants the new tiles, but we plan to contact backers towards the end of the campaign and see what people are thinking about getting to help us cope with the demand.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>New Range</strong><ul><li>We are currently working on the moulds for the first few new sets, so this should help us keep up with demand, but as mentioned above we will be keeping in touch with everyone to make sure we prepare the correct moulds as the campaign goes along.</li></ul>

</h3><p><strong>Are your tiles compatible with other systems?</strong></p><p>In Short, YES!</p><p>Our tiles are set on a 1 inch by 1 inch grid that is compatible not only with other terrain tile systems out there, but also with the various battle maps, flip mats and other gaming aids out there. Our Tiles are double thickness to make it easier for the tiles to integrate with the other systems out there.</p><p><strong>Why Plaster and not Resin?</strong></p><p>For starters, it gives the tiles a stone feel, and a weight to help them not slide around on the table when your using them The Plaster has a very high PSI rating at 18,500, which is extremely high.</p><p>This makes the tiles very durable and resilient to accidental damage and breakage.

Why are you trying to sell his bits as your own?</strong></p><p>That's a very good question!<br/><br/>Firstly we are not trying to sell the Hirst Arts bits as our won, we are selling Dungeon Terrain made from the Hirst Arts Moulds, and we are fully licensed to do so.<br/><br/>Secondly, the pieces we are making are solid pieces. This means we create the original from the Hirst Arts moulds, and then create our own silicone moulds of the pieces. We do this for two reasons:<br/><br/>1) Durability - the crossroads floor piece alone has 40 individual 1 inch square tiles in it. if we made the production piece out of single tiles you would have so many places that the tile could break it would eventually break. One 6-inch by 6-inch piece of plaster is much sturdier than lots of smaller pieces stuck together.<br/><br/>2) Production speed. To create the core set we have used over 500 individual tiles! For one core set you would need to cast up the individual moulds around 35 times to get all the pieces needed to create the pieces.<br/><br/>For you to make this set in all of the finishes we are offering would require you to purchase quote a few different moulds from Hirst Arts, which if that's what you want to do or already have done, we think that's awesome, as we wouldn't be doing this without the amazing moulds that Bruce produces, but we wanted to offer an easier and cheaper way for you guys to get your dungeon terrain.<br/><br/>Obviously if you already have your own moulds, you could still pledge for a core set or two and use your moulds to make accessories or additional pieces, which would also be pretty great!</p></div>","IntroductionHere at DMB we games love our RPG and table-top games. We live for our board games and we are passionate about modelling and creating new things for the table-top. We have always enjoyed bringing the table-top to life through battle maps and scenery. Some of you will already know who we are and what we do. But for those of you who are new to the DMB train, I’ll explain, no wait we don't have enough time for that I’ll just sum up!Two years ago, I started a little company making 3D terrain for D&D games. I saw what was out there and it didn't quite fit what i wanted, so I started making my own. It's proved popular enough for me to give up working in IT full time and to make it my main job, that is down to everyone who has purchased the tiles up to this point, and I can't thank you enough!Now I can expand the range and the company but I need your help to do so. There are some exciting things ahead, let’s get them released!What's the story, and why do I need help?Well to lay my cards on the table as it where, I need some help to raise money to expand the company and get it to the next stage, which is quite an exciting step for me.There are two things I want to achieve from this campaign:
Release new tiles, including some brand-new ranges as well as accessories and tiles for our existing ranges.
Expand the company to include other members of staff and a new workshop to help with promotion, production and all the other tasks I currently do myself.
Revamp the website and improve the photography that is on it now.
O.K. so that is three things, but the third one was an afterthought and would only be considered if the campaign was very successful.I have poured not only money in to the business to get the original molds, the silicone, get us to shows, and the packaging, but my heart and soul into making a product that is great to look at but is also practical and usable for gaming, which at the end of the day is what it is all about.What are we offering you if you decide to support us?We have several Pledge Levels for you guys to chip in on if you would like to. if you look on the Right hand of your screen - That's it just over there... you will see a list of campaign cards.

Each piece you receive is:
Hand Cast
Hand Painted
Hand finished
Hand Packed


You can pick from the color variations we do, if you don't want grey then don't have it grey!
You can pick from any tile or Wall finish that we currently have or that is unlocked as we go through the campaign
What are you going to use the Money for?Well, that’s a great question, and here is how I see it working.First and foremost, I am going to buy as much RTV Silicone as I can. We use this to make the molds that we cast from, and with so many new floor tiles, and accessory sets that we want to release we are going to need a lot of it.5Kg of Silicone costs about £90 and the amount of molds we can get out of one box varies depending upon the size of the molds.We can roughly produce one core set out of 2 box’s Silicone. So, for every 2 “Core set” pledged on this campaign will see the equivalent of a new set of floor tiles & wall tiles produced.Obviously on top of that we have the cost of the plaster and the packaging but you get the idea.I have a list of nearly 70 Accessory sets I’d like to get in to production, and then there are the completely new sets, the Tavern, the Sci-fi, The sewers and the Wilderness sets.The Accessory sets would benefit from being made from resin, so that would be an additional expense, and we would need to procure a vacuum chamber to ensure there are no bubbles.We also currently have a 3D printer sitting in the corner of the office gathering dust so who know what we could do with that as we progress.There are then some new tiles that should have been launched ages ago that feature in the video at the top of the page, the patterned and runic ones. Then we have wooden floors and cobblestone floors to release.Moreover, there are special tiles I want to create, cavern tiles with resin lake pieces, so many pieces, we have over 300 new tiles in our list of tiles waiting to be created and produced.Then there are room and corridor sets that we want to produce like the Arched hall way and the Chapel.All of that is a lot of work for one person, and will require a larger work space, so this is where I need you guys to dig as deep as you can.If we can hit £1000 the extra money raised will go on kitting out my garage as a work space. I need to buy worktops, shelving and flooring to go in there.The Garage is large enough for me to get three people working in there, and will stop me having to spray paint in the back garden on the garden furniture!It means we can get properly organised, have space for stock to be stored so it’s ready to ship when people order it and to enable us to prepare for shows in an easier fashion.And if the campaign reaches the £5,000 I will be able to hire a part time assistant to help me cast and paint, allowing me to produce new pieces with more regularity, and work on the website as well.What if we can’t contribute?I understand not everyone will be able to pledge the money for a core set, but there are a few lower level pledges that you can pledge on, and if you can’t do that, then any think you can do to help spread the word would be greatly appreciated.

Ok maybe not the last one but you get the idea, any way you can share the campaign and raise awareness is excellent.Risks & ChallengesThere are always risks to any project, especially one where everything is hand made, but we have spent 2 years mitigating what we can, where we can.I have chosen to go with the flexible funding on the campaign, which means, if you pledge you will receive something, EVEN IF WE ARE NOT FULLY FUNDED!So, you don’t have to worry about that, you’ll get your pledge no matter what happens.

Current Product RangeWe have all the moulds for our current sets, and the space to churn them out and paint them, as we need to. We have all the Hirst arts moulds we need to make the new sets, as well as the licence from Bruce to enable us to do so.


Resin CastingThe resin piece is new, but I have access to people who have used resin and vacuum chambers before, so that shouldn’t be a problem.


Casting TimeHand Casting everything can be a long process. We will mitigate this by producing out standard stock as the campaign progresses, and then the new unlocked pieces at the end, so we should be able to cover everything that everyone wants easily.The only thing that could affect the dispatch of the tiles at the end of the campaign is if everyone wants the new tiles, but we plan to contact backers towards the end of the campaign and see what people are thinking about getting to help us cope with the demand.


New RangeWe are currently working on the moulds for the first few new sets, so this should help us keep up with demand, but as mentioned above we will be keeping in touch with everyone to make sure we prepare the correct moulds as the campaign goes along.


​FAQ
Are your tiles compatible with other systems?In Short, YES!Our tiles are set on a 1 inch by 1 inch grid that is compatible not only with other terrain tile systems out there, but also with the various battle maps, flip mats and other gaming aids out there. Our Tiles are double thickness to make it easier for the tiles to integrate with the other systems out there.Why Plaster and not Resin?For starters, it gives the tiles a stone feel, and a weight to help them not slide around on the table when your using them The Plaster has a very high PSI rating at 18,500, which is extremely high.This makes the tiles very durable and resilient to accidental damage and breakage. The unpainted tiles can be swept of a table and in to a backpack and carried around, ready for the next session.Why should I Buy from you when these are just made from the Hirst Arts Moulds and i Can Buy them from Hirst arts? Why are you trying to sell his bits as your own?That's a very good question!Firstly we are not trying to sell the Hirst Arts bits as our won, we are selling Dungeon Terrain made from the Hirst Arts Moulds, and we are fully licensed to do so.Secondly, the pieces we are making are solid pieces.

</h3><p class=""imagetext""><span style=""color: windowtext;"">My name is Dirk Laureyssens,
I am a Belgian inventor. My background: I am MS in Political and Social
Sciences. In 1986 I invented a new type of flat-to-cube foam puzzles (<a href=""http://www.happy.be/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span style=""color: windowtext; text-decoration: none;"">http://www.happy.be</span></a>). With these puzzles I was
able to give kids worldwide a fun puzzle that brings 3D thinking and gives kind
of logic and math at the same time. </span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""imagetext""><span style=""color: windowtext;""> </span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""imagetext""><span style=""color: windowtext;"">In 1993 I invented another
toy: A changeable dice. The basic idea is quiet simple: A cube frame has six
empty spaces in which fit small face-disks with various kind of information
(dots, numbers, symbols, logos, actions, images, rules). The fun thing: these
disks can be removed and replaced by other face-disks with other information.
So you get a different dice, completely at your wish. Thus it is a changeable
dice. Check the website: <a href=""http://www.zapdice.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span style=""color: windowtext;"">www.zapdice.com</span></a> to see what this campaign
is in general about. </span></p><p></p><p></p>

<p class=""imagetext""><span style=""color: windowtext;"">This Zap concept brings a
revolution in toptable games since you can adapt famous games, like Monopoly®
or Parchisi, the personal way you want yourself, or you can create yourself new
personal table games. I wrote three technical books about the changeable
concept to protect the copyrights. So I received official USA-copyrights (VA
637632 and VA 637629, Tx 3747990, Tx 3884658)</span><span style="""">  </span><span style=""color: windowtext;"">and similar in Belgium. In
these books I described several ways to play, how the most famous toptable
games can be adapted, a number of new board games and how the disks can be
transferred also into other game tools the like of checkers, pawns, stratego
pieces, etc.</span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""imagetext""><span style=""color: windowtext;"">Thus the Zap concept is all
about “information transfer” between game tools. This is similar like software
that can run on several Operating Systems. You are able to change information,
a value, an instruction, … parameters of your own dice/pawn/checker, but also
hack the zap dice or zap pawn of your opponents!</span></p><p class=""imagetext""><span style=""color: windowtext;""></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/522716/files/20140421100118-transfer_system.jpg?1398099678"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p class=""imagetext""><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">In 1993/1994 I started
production of the changeable dice in China. I had about 20 different moulds. With
a large dice distributor in USA an agreement was signed for the USA-market.
Together we designed various dice, the like of a weather dice, a sports dice, a
power dice, a medical dice, etc. So the basic fundament was ready to create a
revolution in toptable games. However then a disaster happened. The factory in
China had a giant fire and was destroyed completely, including my moulds and
the stock with dice-frames, pawn-frames, checker-frames and disks.</span></p>

<p class=""imagetext""><span style=""color: windowtext;""> </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">Because the changeable dice
concept is that exciting and offers so much fun and freedom to gamers, I want
now to introduce my zapdice campaign here on Indiegogo, to give it a second
life. This zap approach is so innovative and original too good to
disappear. Further it has educational aspects too. The zap parts can be an
excellent tool to learn words and grammatical rules/mechanics of other
languages.</span></p>
<p class=""imagetext""><span style=""color: windowtext;"">I know that the zap approach
for toptable games will bring very exciting new game concepts and games because
it triggers your creative imagination. Just imagine you can create a high-speed
dice, where you can replace in your dice the 1-dot-face by a disk with 9 dots!
But there comes also strategy! Because a high-speed dice may not be that smart
in a game like Monopoly</span><span style=""font-size: 12.0pt; color: windowtext;"">®</span><span style=""color: windowtext;""> because you will run too fast to buy the best houses!
In Zap Moneypoly all four stations receive a “change-a disk” sticker. But think
about another way: speed-up the pawn of your competitor by putting a disk with
+9 on the top. That pawn becomes a high-speed runner! That player can solve his
problem only by landing on a station! Real fun! Real emotions and tension to
remove the +9 disk.</span></p>

complicated since all faces were locally printed with dots and designs. However

<p class=""imagetext""><span style=""color: windowtext;"">Our goal is to have at least
5 production moulds with multi-units (1 zapdice frame + 12 disks + 1 second zap
frame + 1 help-remove spoon). These parts are all connected to a small central
plastic connector-beam. The users can easily remove each separate part from the
connector by a simple turn of the hand.</span></p>
<p class=""imagetext""><span style=""color: windowtext;""><span style=""""> </span></span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""imagetext""><span style=""color: windowtext;"">1) The first mould where the
second zap frame is a pawn (zap pawn). </span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""imagetext""><span style=""color: windowtext;"">2) The second mould where the
second zap frame is a checker (zap checker). </span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""imagetext""><span style=""color: windowtext;"">3) The third mould where the
second zap frame is a stratego mover (zap stratego).</span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""imagetext""><span style=""color: windowtext;"">4) The fourth mould where the
second zap frame is another dice + 20 disks + 1 remove spoon (double zapdice).</span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""imagetext""><span style=""color: windowtext;"">5) The fifth mould just has 30
face-disks.</span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""imagetext""><span style=""color: windowtext;""> </span><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"">The average price per mould
is 18,750 $. That is a total cost of $93,750 for these 5 moulds.</span></p>
<p class=""imagetext""><span style=""color: windowtext;""> </span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""imagetext""><span style=""color: windowtext;"">Other costs: In addition to
the costs for the moulds there are variable and fixed costs related to the
initial stock of the zap dice, new 3D and 2D designs, Packaging design and
stock, Office rent in Hong-Kong, Travel, Administration, handling and cost of
EMS postal services for our perks. These additional costs are budgeted on
125,000$.</span></p><p></p><p></p>

</div>","My name is Dirk Laureyssens,
I am a Belgian inventor. My background: I am MS in Political and Social
Sciences. In 1986 I invented a new type of flat-to-cube foam puzzles (http://www.happy.be). With these puzzles I was
able to give kids worldwide a fun puzzle that brings 3D thinking and gives kind
of logic and math at the same time. 
 
In 1993 I invented another
toy: A changeable dice. The basic idea is quiet simple: A cube frame has six
empty spaces in which fit small face-disks with various kind of information
(dots, numbers, symbols, logos, actions, images, rules). The fun thing: these
disks can be removed and replaced by other face-disks with other information.
So you get a different dice, completely at your wish. Thus it is a changeable
dice. Check the website: www.zapdice.com to see what this campaign
is in general about. 

This Zap concept brings a
revolution in toptable games since you can adapt famous games, like Monopoly®
or Parchisi, the personal way you want yourself, or you can create yourself new
personal table games. I wrote three technical books about the changeable
concept to protect the copyrights. So I received official USA-copyrights (VA
637632 and VA 637629, Tx 3747990, Tx 3884658)  and similar in Belgium. In
these books I described several ways to play, how the most famous toptable
games can be adapted, a number of new board games and how the disks can be
transferred also into other game tools the like of checkers, pawns, stratego
pieces, etc.
Thus the Zap concept is all
about “information transfer” between game tools. This is similar like software
that can run on several Operating Systems. You are able to change information,
a value, an instruction, … parameters of your own dice/pawn/checker, but also
hack the zap dice or zap pawn of your opponents!
In 1993/1994 I started
production of the changeable dice in China. I had about 20 different moulds. With
a large dice distributor in USA an agreement was signed for the USA-market.
Together we designed various dice, the like of a weather dice, a sports dice, a
power dice, a medical dice, etc. So the basic fundament was ready to create a
revolution in toptable games. However then a disaster happened. The factory in
China had a giant fire and was destroyed completely, including my moulds and
the stock with dice-frames, pawn-frames, checker-frames and disks.
 
Give it a second life!
 Because the changeable dice
concept is that exciting and offers so much fun and freedom to gamers, I want
now to introduce my zapdice campaign here on Indiegogo, to give it a second
life. This zap approach is so innovative and original too good to
disappear. Further it has educational aspects too. The zap parts can be an
excellent tool to learn words and grammatical rules/mechanics of other
languages.
I know that the zap approach
for toptable games will bring very exciting new game concepts and games because
it triggers your creative imagination. Just imagine you can create a high-speed
dice, where you can replace in your dice the 1-dot-face by a disk with 9 dots!
But there comes also strategy! Because a high-speed dice may not be that smart
in a game like Monopoly® because you will run too fast to buy the best houses!
In Zap Moneypoly all four stations receive a “change-a disk” sticker. But think
about another way: speed-up the pawn of your competitor by putting a disk with
+9 on the top. That pawn becomes a high-speed runner! That player can solve his
problem only by landing on a station! Real fun! Real emotions and tension to
remove the +9 disk.
 
Contributions.
 
By the support of the
contributors we will be able to order the injection moulds to have High Quality
products. Without your support we will have financial difficulties to bring the
zapdice project into reality because moulds are expensive (± 18,750 $/unit).
 
The basic mould.
The Basic zap mould has four
parts: (1) the frame of the dice (each side: 18 mm), (2) the frame of a special
game-part, (3) 12 little face-disks (Ø: 12,5 mm) which fit into the connector
parts of the dice or fit on top of the pawn/checker, and (4) a small tool
(protecting your finger nails) to help you to remove easily the disks from the
dice. 
 
With this basic mould we can
produce zap tools in any color. We plan to have zap dice/tools in next colors:
white, red, blue, green, purple, yellow, grey, orange, lime and pink.
 The production in 1995 was
complicated since all faces were locally printed with dots and designs. However
that gave assembly problems during the handling in plastic bags. Some
face-disks were mixed. Therefore we will work now with small transparent
stickers that you can glue on the face-disks. You can choose yourself which
one(s) when you compose your own zap dice.
 
Yet ten sticker sets. 
We use small stickers to be
glued on the face-disks.
 As a first step we have
designed 10 different sticker sets, each with 60 different designs. Later we
will design much more of such stickers, where people can make suggestions, or
even offer their own design(s).
We designed 10 sticker sets;
each has 60 small circular stickers. 7 sets have transparent plastic.  Six of the sets are printed in black
with images, numbers, letters, objects, signs, symbols and actions. One set is
in color.
 One set stays blank. This
blank set is not printed so you can write, design or add with a fine permanent
marker your own “information” or “value” on each of the little circular
stickers.
One set is not transparent
but based on white plastic. On that set is printed 60 times in color the “change-a-disk logo”. You can glue such small stickers on parts of the board or playfield of an existing board game to indicate that on that place you can change the disk of any dice, pawn or checker.This change-a-disk logo will also appear on one or more of your face-disks in your ""power"" or ""action"" zap dice. What We Need & What You
Get
 
Our goal is to have at least
5 production moulds with multi-units (1 zapdice frame + 12 disks + 1 second zap
frame + 1 help-remove spoon). These parts are all connected to a small central
plastic connector-beam. The users can easily remove each separate part from the
connector by a simple turn of the hand.
 
1) The first mould where the
second zap frame is a pawn (zap pawn). 
2) The second mould where the
second zap frame is a checker (zap checker). 
3) The third mould where the
second zap frame is a stratego mover (zap stratego).
4) The fourth mould where the
second zap frame is another dice + 20 disks + 1 remove spoon (double zapdice).
5) The fifth mould just has 30
face-disks.
 The average price per mould
is 18,750 $. That is a total cost of $93,750 for these 5 moulds.
 
Other costs: In addition to
the costs for the moulds there are variable and fixed costs related to the
initial stock of the zap dice, new 3D and 2D designs, Packaging design and
stock, Office rent in Hong-Kong, Travel, Administration, handling and cost of
EMS postal services for our perks. These additional costs are budgeted on
125,000$.
 
Thus the total project is
218,750$.

What is the Impact of our Zap
Dice Campaign?
 
The Zap Concept is going to
create a revolution in toptable games, with exciting variations of games like
Snakes and Ladders, Parcheesi, Monopoly®, Risk, and … Collector card games and
other RPG’s. 
 In general we can say that
Zap Concept changes completely the mechanics of toptable games, and creates new
ways to play our favorite board games and role-playing games. Did you know that
in 1994/1995 a new draft edition of D&D (Dungeons and Dragons) of TSR was
designed with the Zap dice? The stupid lawyer of TSR prevented an agreement.
The zap dice can solve a lot
of the problems D&Ds have because a number of zap die can focus on specific
tasks in RPG’s, like by a Game Master Dice, a Charisma Dice, a Level Dice, a
Battle Dice, a Map Dice, a Trap Dice, Food Dice, Wormhole Dice, two or three
weapons Die, a Spells Dice, etc., each with related zap faces. 
 With the Zap Dice the players
have suddenly a new freedom to use logic and strategy combined with “luck
dynamics” in an unprecedented way. The player is no longer dependent on the
traditional mathematical random outcome. No, the player can now adapt the dice
(the traditional randomizer) and the game pieces the way he wants. I call this
guiding luck.
But that’s not all! The
player can influence the game by the possibility to give and transfer powers,
skills, values, and properties to other parts of the game, the like of the
pawns, the checkers and Stratego movers.Just a simple example: Imagine a
chess-game where a simple pawn receives the power to jump as a knight! 
 For game-inventors the Zap
approach is a heaven. The face-disks offer the possibilities to avoid complex
problems in design, like the need to use extra cards to give instructions or
chance. Now it is possible to create a “power” dice, a “functions” dice, a
“trash” dice, a ‘chance” dice (with go-to-jail, pay-100$-tax, receive-500$
faces, etc) or a “NASDAQ” dice with tickers! And such special die can be thrown
together or … depending on the rules. So, imagination unlimited.
 
And there is more! You can
adapt your actual games with our zap stickers. Just glue some stickers on
certain spots of the board. You want to give more excitement to Hasbro’s
Monopoly®? You just glue a “change-disk-logo” on each Station. Thus on arrival
on a station that player has the right to change a face of his own zap dice or
of his zap pawn, or in the zap dice or zap pawn of one of an other player! A
special transfer or trash zap dice can contain the face-disks that were
“stolen” before and are now available for retransfer. 
 Next image shows how the
Parcheesi game can be adapted with change-a-disk-stickers.

our Zap Dice campaign. That way you help to save the zap concept for the
future, and you help to bring back the Zap tools in physical reality. The

processes in our analysis of the complex world we live in. This zap concept
even resembles real life. Most toptable games are a mini reflection of one or a
combination of the certain aspects of life in our society. When we understand that
we can guide “luck” in a limited way and if we can master it’s  mechanics by
logic, experience and lateral thinking, we can become a winner. If although we
make the wrong choice(s), we may loose. That’s one of the insights the Zap dice
and it’s zap companions learn us. That’s why this campaign is important. 
 
                                        ----------------------------- 
If you cannot contribute to
our Zap Dice campaign there are other ways you can help!
Some suggestions: 
(1) If you have artistic
skills you might want to design - copyright free - a number of original face-disks. That would be very useful. Especially sports-related zap faces and
Dungeons & Dragons designs are needed. For D&D I think about faces for
Medieval Magic Weapons, Charisma, Skills, Monsters, Worlds, Combat, Level,
Spells and the Game Master Die. Your name will be printed as “designed by:
credit your name and email
address” on such D&D or sports
sticker set. However you must keep in mind that the logo’s of sports clubs are
mostly trademarks. Please send your ideas about stickers to
zapstickers(at)zapdice.com or to dungeons(at)zapdice.com. Thank you!
(2) If you have original
ideas of special game-frames (game pieces in 3D like ships, cars, airplanes, …)
we would appreciate your suggestions. We have already the idea to make special
3D-head disks to put on top of the zap pawns. These can be perfect for D&D games and RPGs.
If you have other original
ideas or even .stl-files or .stp-files, please send them to
zapsuggestions(at)zapdice.com. Thank you!
(3) If you like the zap
concepts and if believe that this is a fundamental innovation in gaming you might want to
inform the public by publishing an entry in the dice section of Wikipedia. Thank
you!
(4) You can help also by
promoting our Zap Dice Indiegogo campaign or inform friends or people on Internet
about the Zap concepts (your web site, forums, blogs, facebook, YouTube or
other social media). You can use the Indiegogo share tools to make real noise!
Thank you!

Each discussion is focused on individual topics, kickstarter practices, and board game related issues that can be improved on. This one-on-one discussion not only gives the audience the viewpoints from both the publisher and the consumer/content creator; audience interaction is encouraged. Similar to an AMA (ask me anything), we answer questions live on the stream. In our game walkthroughs, each episode starts with a quick how to play then immediately launches into a game playthrough. As we play through games, each host talks to the audience about strategies and go further into detail of the mechanics of the game. It's Your Turn Livestream also just launched a playtest option for new game designers and publishers to aid in getting their game ready for Kickstarter. (PM us for more details)</p><p><strong>TLDR Game Series</strong> is a standalone review channel. We made this separation between our channels to keep our reviews honest. These reviews provide fun, engaging, concise, and knowledgable content for viewers to enjoy while on the go. In each video, we provide a quick overview of the game then explain what we liked and what we found could be improved on in each game. Instead of concluding each review with an arbitrary point or start system we just ask three questions:</p><ul>
<li>Would you recommend?</li>

<p>Geeetech, found in 2011 ,specializes in 3D printing， EDB(Embedded 
Development Board), MCU as well as open source hardware design, produce 
and sales. We can  provide you a  wide  range of electronic parts and 
components , especially 3D printer control boards and accessaries in 
virtue of the largest electronic market (Seg &amp; HuaQiang market) and 
the most complete chain of electronics industry in China,even in the 
world.</p>
<p>We have 3 different versions of printer designed by our engineer and 
they are are selling quiet well , the other two new printers will be 
unveiled  recently. please stay tuned .We also have different extruder 
in our company from GT1 to GT9 . For GT9, our engineers create 
distinctive designs, making this extruder more suitable for our friends 
to use. We have already produced some parts of this extruder, all of 
them works well. And now we are launching this campaign to raise funds 
for the volume purchase of raw materials to keeo our project moving 
forward and to get more people know us , this is where you come in.</p><br/><h1>
<b>About extruder:
</b>
</h1>
<p>With the increasing popularity of 3 d printing, more and more printer
 appeared in our life, printing technology update rapidly, especially in
 the design of extruder. Take our team as example; through constant 
innovation and continuous improvement, we have designed 12 models of 
extruder, standard and Bowden in 3 years. GT9s is our latest one. This 
extruder adopts high-quality aluminum alloy heat radiator and brass 
nozzle, with stainless steel pipe as feeding pipe, which ensures good 
heat insulation effect and prevents blockage. Its surface is covered 
with anodic oxide coating, which can resist oxidation corrosion and 
increase nozzle hardness and surface area of heat radiator. Besides, the
 cooling fan directly faces to operation area. All such special designs 
ensure better heat insulation as well as finer and more stable 
printing.If you are aspiring for higher stability of Print technology,  
our GT9S is a good choice for you. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/781787/files/20140812001518-2.jpg?1407827718"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p><p> Cool end: Motor-driven, simple structure, easy to assemble. The fan
 is better in heat insulation that reduce the workload for the motor, so
 that it can work more stability for a long time.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/781789/files/20140812001552-3.jpg?1407827752"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><div>
<p>Hot End : Metal J-head V2.0- hotend high temperature, stable, brass 
nozzles, fixed with cooling fan that makes heat better and more stable, 
fan mounting bracket can be connected to a nozzle heating block and 
bottom bracket, fixed more stable.</p>
<h1><b> Design

</b></h1>
<p>We are looking for a  better design that can avoid the same problem 
as traditional hotends suffer. So we add the cooling fan directly faces 
to the operating area. Besides,  PTFE and PEEK are replaced by the  
stainless steel pipe which ensures more stable printing.

to have a head start. We plan to begin shipping soon after the campaign 
completes. (first in first out)
   Our story:
Geeetech, found in 2011 ,specializes in 3D printing， EDB(Embedded 
Development Board), MCU as well as open source hardware design, produce 
and sales. We can  provide you a  wide  range of electronic parts and 
components , especially 3D printer control boards and accessaries in 
virtue of the largest electronic market (Seg & HuaQiang market) and 
the most complete chain of electronics industry in China,even in the 
world.
We have 3 different versions of printer designed by our engineer and 
they are are selling quiet well , the other two new printers will be 
unveiled  recently. please stay tuned .We also have different extruder 
in our company from GT1 to GT9 . For GT9, our engineers create 
distinctive designs, making this extruder more suitable for our friends 
to use. We have already produced some parts of this extruder, all of 
them works well. And now we are launching this campaign to raise funds 
for the volume purchase of raw materials to keeo our project moving 
forward and to get more people know us , this is where you come in.
About extruder:


With the increasing popularity of 3 d printing, more and more printer
 appeared in our life, printing technology update rapidly, especially in
 the design of extruder. Take our team as example; through constant 
innovation and continuous improvement, we have designed 12 models of 
extruder, standard and Bowden in 3 years. GT9s is our latest one. This 
extruder adopts high-quality aluminum alloy heat radiator and brass 
nozzle, with stainless steel pipe as feeding pipe, which ensures good 
heat insulation effect and prevents blockage. Its surface is covered 
with anodic oxide coating, which can resist oxidation corrosion and 
increase nozzle hardness and surface area of heat radiator. Besides, the
 cooling fan directly faces to operation area. All such special designs 
ensure better heat insulation as well as finer and more stable 
printing.If you are aspiring for higher stability of Print technology,  
our GT9S is a good choice for you. 

 Cool end: Motor-driven, simple structure, easy to assemble. The fan
 is better in heat insulation that reduce the workload for the motor, so
 that it can work more stability for a long time.


Hot End : Metal J-head V2.0- hotend high temperature, stable, brass 
nozzles, fixed with cooling fan that makes heat better and more stable, 
fan mounting bracket can be connected to a nozzle heating block and 
bottom bracket, fixed more stable.
 Design


We are looking for a  better design that can avoid the same problem 
as traditional hotends suffer. So we add the cooling fan directly faces 
to the operating area. Besides,  PTFE and PEEK are replaced by the  
stainless steel pipe which ensures more stable printing.

Suitable raw material: PLA and ABS


Printing resolution: 0.1mm


Molding form: FDM


Printing thickness: 0.1mm-0.3mm


Nozzle temperature: 180℃-260℃

<h3>How Game Club came to be</h3>
<p>I was placed at Craigmillar Library after library staff submitted a proposal for a Reading Champion to work with young people aged 10-18. The library has brilliant engagement with younger children – but when they move towards high school, they almost always stop attending the public library. </p>
<p>I didn't want to parachute in and start things without speaking to the young folk in question, so the first thing I did in post was run focus groups in the local high schools – and in other partnership organisations – to determine what they'd most enjoy and benefit from. The word that kept coming up was “games.” I took this magical word back to the library staff and we spent a while thinking about ways in which we could combine games and gaming with books and reading. Then, in June 2016, we launched Game Club.</p>
<p>At Game Club – which is free, open to anyone aged 10-18, and meets every Monday evening in the library – we play analogue, table-top games with boards, dice, cards and tokens. All the games we play have a connection to reading, writing, storytelling and literacy. We play Once Upon A Time, a beautifully illustrated card game that allows the young people to write and share their own intricate fairytales. We play Storycubes, a pictoral dice game that serves as an always-random creative writing prompt with hundreds of variations. And we play Story Stones, a game created with inspiration from the Scottish Storytelling Centre – the young people use words painted on stones to create short, tactile, beautiful poems and short stories.<br/><br/>Now, the Game Club kids and teens are creating their own table-top game. They've spent the last few months planning it, and making mock-ups. The board would be a haunted house, and be built one room at a time, with each room like a new chapter of a story. The theme would be fairy tales: playable characters in the game include vampires, fairies, werewolves, witches and ghosts. Each new room the characters move into contains a new challenge, written by the kids themselves – solve a riddle before you can go on; do battle with a bad guy; open a secret chest and read the clue inside. The aim of the game is to find the hidden treasure room, and solve the various riddles and puzzles to be the first to unlock it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What we'd like to do</h3>
<p>We'd like to take this game from its current state (played using cards and pieces made of paper, drawn on with felt pens) all the way to industry-level completion.  We'd spend money from this crowdfund on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bringing in a game artist, illustrator or designer to run workshops with the group, and -- with their collaboration -- create a full set of game artwork</li>
<li>Having the game professionally printed and boxed -- as many copies as we can afford!</li>
<li>Distributing the printed games (entirely for free) to schools, libraries and other community settings -- we'd like the Game Club members to be able to sit down and play this game with their peers, families, teachers, or anyone they wanted to challenge!</li>
<li>Creating an accompanying set of PDF printables, so the game has the potential to travel anywhere -- it could be played in schools, libraries and communities across the world!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>How this will benefit the Game Club</h3>
<p>Craigmillar is a community in flux: there are lots of big changes happening in the form of regeneration, and the arrival of new buildings, businesses and organisations.  Though things are improving, Craigmillar remains one of Edinburgh's (and indeed, Scotland's) most deprived areas.  Investment in the local community is not only needed, but truly valued.</p>
<p>One of the things I heard when I started in my job as Reading Champion was: ""the young people here don't settle to anything.  They start projects but then they drift away without finishing them.  We're currently struggling to improve that.""</p>
<p>Against the odds -- transition to high school; homework; exams; family commitments and worries, and all manner of other barriers -- the young people who come to Game Club have kept on showing up, and have worked really hard over a period of several months to create their game.  They've worked together across community and cultural lines, bonded with their gaming peers and welcomed new people into their group.</p>
<p>The group are already proud of what they have made.  But a professionally-produced version of their brilliant game would make their work all the more worthwhile.  Right now, they play the game together in the library -- we'd like them to be able to play the game in their school library, or take it to the local council office and challenge the staff there, or even take it to the Scottish Parliament and see if the First Minister fancies a go.  Not to mention -- being able to put 'game developer' on your CV at the age of eleven?  Impressive, right?  We'd like this game to be another step on the road to a bright future for these young people.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is going to be hard work.  The young people already involved know that.  But they also know that they have other commitments, and can't always be in a specific room in a specific place at a specific time.  As library staff, we're accustomed to dealing with patchy attendance, or providing pastoral support when it's needed.  One of our challenges will be ensuring that other professionals we bring in to work on the game are also flexible enough to do this.</p>
<p>We've already encountered a lot of challenges along the way.  Happily, we come to this crowdfund with working mock-ups of the game already made -- we've already ironed out the game play and game mechanics, and have a rough idea of the physical form that the game will take.  Trust me -- this was not an easy process!  But while we're hoping that the hardest part of the process is over, we're always ready to solve new problems and figure out a collaborative solution to challenges that may arise.  The young people who attend Game Club are nothing if not resilient!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We'd love it if you could give just a little bit of money to help us make this game a real thing in the world.  However, we understand that not everyone can do that.  But what you CAN do is one or all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tweet about this campaign, share it on Facebook, blog about it, or otherwise spread the word online</li>
<li>Talk to people 'IRL' (in real life!) about this campaign.  Put it in front of people who like games, people who want to support libraries, people who engage with youngsters, or anyone who might be able to help us promote it</li>
</ul>

Since I designed my first game in 2013, I have been volunteering and working with a charity to improve the quality of education and increase youth employment/participation in Nigeria.Today, I am introducing you to 14 board games made in Nigeria. This campaign is a dream come true because growing up, I only played 7 board games as there where no other. However, my team and I have been able to change all of that. We have introduced new board games by designing new ones, organizing free tabletop gaming activities and introducing new boardgames through donations by amazing gamers worldwide. And the excitement when people play these games are beyond expression.Getting these games to you will give us the opportunity to introduce African and Nigerian gaming story to you as well as understanding your perspective to our game story, mechanics, designs and production, it will also encourage us to continue improving the Tabletop gaming community in Nigeria.We are hoping to get 100 of each of the games to the global Tabletop gaming community and the profit made from the games will help us open the first Tabletop Game Café in Nigeria. If we don’t reach our goal, we will persevere till we achieve it. However, we will continue to be grateful to people who will be getting our games or supporting in sharing our story.The impact of your contribution can never be measured. Helping us reach this goal will:
Enable us open a Tabletop board game café.
Encourage us to continue building the tabletop gaming community in Nigeria.
Allow us understand your reaction to Nigerian board game design and production.In the past, we have organized 2 yearly free board game conventions known as AB Con In 2016, it was termed “arguably the first board gaming convention in West Africa” by the Nigerian Television Authority (NTA). We have also organized free board gaming workshop for children since 2016, created and published weekly game puzzles in a National Dailies (best daily newspaper in Nigeria since 2015). Our work has received international and local publicity from news agencies such as Kenyan TV, Thomas Reuters, France 24 (french), NTA, Daily Trust Newspaper and a host of online blogs and magazine.We have distributed over 6000 games that we have designed and produced in Nigeria; this has given us the avenue to change perception and introduce people to board gaming. This campaign will now help reach you too especially as we have been able to secure a ‘value for money’ shipping deal.Our PERKS are designed carefully to give as much option depending on your budget. We have designed it to enable you get value for money for shipping price. Each shipping price can take up to 2KG of the games.

What happens if target is not reachedIf we are not able to secure the fund we need, we will look for a march funding however, if that also is not achieved, we will secure an agreement with with a hotel to use their space until we can get our own space. As this is limited especially with Nigeria environment, it is because it is really important and urgent to get a gaming cafe to give people who are already showing interest in boardgaming a safe environment to play and talk about games.What happens if the target is exceeded?We will be extremely excited. Then we get back to work. If it's enough to open another cafe in a new state, we will be able to do that.

<p>Beyond the Inner Sea lie the high mountains of the Holmgard, the Roof of the World. Here the country is wild, and dangerous, sparsely settled by barbarians, dwarves and the occasional mad wizard. It is a hard land of narrow paths, deep canyons, cliffs without purchase; a land of snow and ice, that offers little comfort for those who risk her high walks. It is a land of giants, where giants once roosted, where dwarves built homes and dungeons. It is a land wholly forgotten but rich in lost treasures that echo a world long gone. It is one rich in adventure, filled with wealth beyond imagining and glory for those who do not fall.</p>
<p>Beyond the mountains lies the Gottland, the land without gods. This too is a land of imagined treasures, where giants, trolls and gods with cloven feet have walked for countless years.

  We put a lot of thought into the mechanics and design of the game to make sure it would be fun and educational at the same time.We are using larger cards (3.5” x 5.75”). These allow players to show the experiment description and illustration to other players, and question cards will be easier to read this way.
 The result is a huge deck of cards!
   We were passionate about the art used in the experiments’ illustrations. Each card has a unique illustration created especially for our game by Miki Mottes.We were fortunate to work with Miki (www.mikimottes.com), a top illustrator who created the amazing art we're using throughout the game and in our campaign. Initially, we thought about having a couple of characters who would illustrate the different experiments on the Question Cards. Miki drafted these characters for us to select from:
Mustache and Eggplant
Duck and Can
Fox and Tooth
We liked them all so much that we decided to keep all of them (except for the happy tooth, which was a bit too creepy). Then Miki added Rabtus, the Cactus Rabbit and Cumber, the cucumber. This is what the gang looked like in their first group game: Credits:

</p><p>Hello, ladies and

<p>Our company produces

<p>
</p><p>Till today we were making
and selling standalone figures, that had only 28mm scale in common.
It was fun, but we aim higher! Now we are <b>making our own tabletop fantasy
wargame</b>, and we need your help. We imagine it as a skirmish game in a
fantasy world: small armies of 2-10 miniatures fighting against each
other.</p>
<p>At first we plan to make a

and everything else that changes a figure box into a game set.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446602874/zfp1shdoqno1y52zohzp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>To this day we <b>sculpted,

takes place in the dungeons.</span><br/></p>
<p>The flesh of the earth pitted with caves
like cheese — with holes. The underground
world can compete with the sublunar both area and the amount and
variety of creatures inhabiting it. Dungeons complicated and endless,
they stretch for thousands of kilometers under the green meadows and
forests of the world, being, as it were, his reflection. Huge granite
halls in whiling away the Sisters live, replaced with
Kobold's labyrinth, those in turn
output to the black oily lakes with icy water. Ghoulish creatures
live on the shores of these lakes, feeding on pale newts picking
seashells from rock crevices. Fiery river that washed the roots of
the mountains, generate flaming salamanders and musty corridors
beneath the ruins of the ancient city became a haven for
nightmarish Flesheaters. Yet surface
dwellers come, seeking their doom: from righteous warriors of holy
orders, to unscrupulous mercenaries and treasure hunters, they seek
to bring fire and steel into the World Below, which has long become a
place of eternal war, yet the fights are won and lost in narrow
tunnels and nightmarish ruins rather than battlefields. It is here
that guile, cunning and magic are worth more than sheer numbers and
brute strength.</p>
<p>All of them have something to contend
with each other and therefore the underworld is a
field of endless war. This is what we try to tell the extent of the
forces released us by the Creator.</p>
<p>Welcome to the Dungeon.</p><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446603251/ypunwjubfzrmobx1lrmc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Dungeon
Sisters</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Deep down below the surface lands
sprawls a huge maze, a web of catacombs and tunnels where the darkest
creatures dwell and terrible acts of cruelty are committed. This is
the realm of the Dungeon Sisters, an ancient and sinister sect of
female warriors, each of them gifted with eternal beauty and sick
imagination. Cries of anguish and lust echo across these dimly lit
halls, as whips sting at ivory skin, spiked wheels slowly turn and
other, more devious, tools see macabre action. While the Sisters
delight in torture and corruption of prisoners, they often willingly
take place on racks next to their victims, gleefully embracing pain
and disgrace they so eagerly dispense <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">upon others as well. Givers and takers,
unrelenting torturers and willing slaves, they are the epitome of two
opposites, readily taking place at either end of the whip.</span></p>
<p>It is in battle where their deadly
grace truly shines, however. Barbed lashes and curved daggers,
needle-sharp heels and rending talons leave a trail of bloody
splashes in their wake as the Sisters perform the dance of death,
easily overcoming even the most barbaric or well-trained foes. As a
display of their arrogance and sinful beauty, they are barely
dressed, their succulent bodies mesmerizing hapless enemies. Any
wounds the Sisters may receive only drive them <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">further into the realm of pain-induced
bliss.</span></p>
<p>Dark of soul and evil of mind, the
Sisters are little but slaves to their very nature, as they draw
power from emotions – anguish and lust being the easiest to bring
forth, and certainly the strongest. Should their ever make a pause in
their quest for pain and pleasure, they would wither and die...
making their utmost depravity a bare necessity.</p>
<p>Come and at take a closer look at the
Dungeon Sisters… if you dare!</p><p></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>

Part 1: Dungeon Sisters

Hello, ladies and
gentlemen! I am Igor aka Brother Vinni! You probably know me, or at
least heard of me.
Our company produces
original fantasy and sci-fi 28mm miniatures, which you can find here:
http://www.brother-vinni.com/rus/shop.htm#!/~/category/id=5901131&offset=0&sort=normal

Till today we were making
and selling standalone figures, that had only 28mm scale in common.
It was fun, but we aim higher! Now we are making our own tabletop fantasy
wargame, and we need your help. We imagine it as a skirmish game in a
fantasy world: small armies of 2-10 miniatures fighting against each
other.
At first we plan to make a
line of miniatures, then - add rule and printed stuff, accessories
and everything else that changes a figure box into a game set.To this day we sculpted,
cast and painted 6 miniatures to give you a taste of the game
visuals. If the campaign is successfully funded, we sculpt more
according to the plan below.Concept, scultpting and
casting: Brother Vinni Studios

The World Below
The action of the first part of the game
takes place in the dungeons.
The flesh of the earth pitted with caves
like cheese — with holes. The underground
world can compete with the sublunar both area and the amount and
variety of creatures inhabiting it. Dungeons complicated and endless,
they stretch for thousands of kilometers under the green meadows and
forests of the world, being, as it were, his reflection. Huge granite
halls in whiling away the Sisters live, replaced with
Kobold's labyrinth, those in turn
output to the black oily lakes with icy water. Ghoulish creatures
live on the shores of these lakes, feeding on pale newts picking
seashells from rock crevices. Fiery river that washed the roots of
the mountains, generate flaming salamanders and musty corridors
beneath the ruins of the ancient city became a haven for
nightmarish Flesheaters. Yet surface
dwellers come, seeking their doom: from righteous warriors of holy
orders, to unscrupulous mercenaries and treasure hunters, they seek
to bring fire and steel into the World Below, which has long become a
place of eternal war, yet the fights are won and lost in narrow
tunnels and nightmarish ruins rather than battlefields. It is here
that guile, cunning and magic are worth more than sheer numbers and
brute strength.
All of them have something to contend
with each other and therefore the underworld is a
field of endless war. This is what we try to tell the extent of the
forces released us by the Creator.
Welcome to the Dungeon.Dungeon
Sisters

Deep down below the surface lands
sprawls a huge maze, a web of catacombs and tunnels where the darkest
creatures dwell and terrible acts of cruelty are committed. This is
the realm of the Dungeon Sisters, an ancient and sinister sect of
female warriors, each of them gifted with eternal beauty and sick
imagination. Cries of anguish and lust echo across these dimly lit
halls, as whips sting at ivory skin, spiked wheels slowly turn and
other, more devious, tools see macabre action. While the Sisters
delight in torture and corruption of prisoners, they often willingly
take place on racks next to their victims, gleefully embracing pain
and disgrace they so eagerly dispense upon others as well. Givers and takers,
unrelenting torturers and willing slaves, they are the epitome of two
opposites, readily taking place at either end of the whip.
It is in battle where their deadly
grace truly shines, however. Barbed lashes and curved daggers,
needle-sharp heels and rending talons leave a trail of bloody
splashes in their wake as the Sisters perform the dance of death,
easily overcoming even the most barbaric or well-trained foes. As a
display of their arrogance and sinful beauty, they are barely
dressed, their succulent bodies mesmerizing hapless enemies. Any
wounds the Sisters may receive only drive them further into the realm of pain-induced
bliss.
Dark of soul and evil of mind, the
Sisters are little but slaves to their very nature, as they draw
power from emotions – anguish and lust being the easiest to bring
forth, and certainly the strongest. Should their ever make a pause in
their quest for pain and pleasure, they would wither and die...
making their utmost depravity a bare necessity.
Come and at take a closer look at the
Dungeon Sisters… if you dare!
Miniatures
Descriptions regarding the
mechanics of the game, rather relative and may be changed in the
future:



YoungerSisters (5 models)Hot and conceited,
	they often ignore armor, exposing their bodies and are proud of
	them. Fighting half-naked is dangerous, but what is the risk in
	comparison with the admiring gaze that goes off in the eyes of a
	dying enemy. The last thing he sees in this life will be your
	beauty. And trust me,
	it's not the worst thing that ever imprinted in the dead pupils ..Younger
	Sisters prefer short and razor-sharp weapon. Their arsenal
	contains of a sickle, curved knives,
	blades that allow have a close look at the
	person to whom to kill.


Basic Sisters
	(5 models) The core of the underground army - quite experienced sister, protected by light armor. Their battle experience allows them to choose the weapons themselves and to the liking of the situation, but generally they prefer heavy sabers and cutlasses.


Silent Guard.
	(5 models)
Elite soldiers. Scary
	opponents, these women are protected with
	exquisite armor closing their body from the tail hair on the
	head to the heels of boots. Despite the armor, they move
	frighteningly fast, attacking like scorpions, and their black
	naginatas do not know slip, cutting bones
	like a soft cartilages. During the battle,
	no sound, no groan, no swearing you hear from under the iron mask of
	Silent Guard amazons,
	they fight and die in silence. Even the agony in his own blood
	cooling is not able to open their mouths. This terrible silence,
	accompanied by their inhuman cruelty able to scare any opponent up
	stupor.


Shadows (3
	models)
Generally, throwing
	weapons used in underground less than on
	the surface - not the distance to meke showers
	of arrows for each other. Nevertheless,
	among the Dungeon Sisters exists
	a special caste of warriors, preferring to
	shoot from ambush encounter face to face. They do not wear armor,
	dressed in matte black suits and prefer seldom to
	appear on the enemy's eyes. For masking
	they wearing their hair
	tails at the rear of the head, not on the top, like a
	boastful melee sisters who want to look
	taller on the battlefield. The main weapon of Shadows
	is a small crossbow with steel arch and a
	bowstring, woven from the hair of their own owner. Shot from this
	crossbow breaks muscles, throwing splinters of bone from the wound
	on the other side. In the melee the fight shadows are completely
	useless and almost immediately retreat.


Witches
	(2 models)
Those sisters
	who have brains in their head a little
	more than required for the endless battles and orgies, can become
	witches. Their arsenal of magic is not very wide, but several deadly
	spells they use quite confident. Almost
	all of their magic is based on the flowing blood and the suffering
	of the witch, so in close combat, they are very vulnerable and try
	to stay behind.


Executioneress
	(1 model)
The overseer with a whip
	may be added to the band of the Younger
	Sisters. This experienced lady fighting
	along with their wards, has also time to
	watch them, holding too hot-tempered  and
	urging timids with the whip. She
	increases the combat capability of the group.


Victim
	Level 1 (2 models)
The
	suffering prisoner may be added to the band
	of Younger and Basic Sisters. She does not participate in
	combat, but her suffering ignited cruelty
	and lust in her friends, that
	enhances the combat capability of the group.


Victim
	Level 2 (1 model)
Stationary unit -
	suffering sister. If this martyr is
	on the battlefield, Withces
	can enhance their spells, soaking their
	voluntarily accepted pain.


Victim 3 levels
	(altar)
Stationary unit - the
	altar with the victim. Located on the field, this
	sacred altar of Pain fills the hearts of Sisters
	with thirst for blood, and suffering of
	the victims are pushing their lust.


Medusa (3
	models)
Physiology of
	Dungeon Sisters is that they can interbreed and produce offspring
	with nearly all the inhabitants of their world. A warped mind
	sometimes pushes them to such experiments that could be born only in
	a sick imagination of a madman. The fruits of these orgies are often
	remarkably tenacious and can successfully complete the underground
	army of its parents. Medusa have absorbed all the most unpleasant
	quality of those from whom they come: a mad rage and bloodlust of
	Sisters combined them with a snake composure and quick reflexes. In
	addition, their sight has a weak hypnotic effect. They are enough
	smart to use the weapon in the battle, but otherwise they are rather
	clever animals
	than intelligent creature.
	They understand orders badly and
	often behave absolutely unpredictably.


Queen

	Actually, the commander of the underground army. It has exceptional
	fighting skills and also can use some
	spells.

<p>Cavern Tavern uses worker (dice) placement and resource management mechanics. </p>
<p>Every player has 4 dice that represents his available actions. On each turn, a player can assign his dice to 1 of the 21 locations in the tavern. These locations require different amount of dice value and each location holds a different reward. The players can choose to place 1 die on a location, combine them in groups to receive bigger rewards, or discard them to receive benefits that will help them advance in the game. So when the player rolls his 4 dice, he has a lot of options where to put them and how to use them, thus forming a strategy and reducing the luck factor to minimum.</p>
<p>The locations are divided into 6 sections: </p>
<p><b>1. Main area</b>: Players pick up Orders from guests in this section. </p>
<p><b>2. Cellar</b>: The ingredients used to complete orders are located in this section.</p>
<p><b>3. Kitchen</b>: Players can work in this section to receive rewards.</p>
<p><b>4. Chores</b>: Players can complete chores in this section to receive rewards.</p>
<p><b>5. Wizard’s Workshop</b>: Players can seek help for completing their Orders in this section.</p>
<p><b>6. Nasty the Dwarf’s Office</b>: Players can suck up to the boss and badmouth coworkers in this section.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1463420782/2b3f4478e98d05a4dbb2efe24f77fed1_original_xxziib.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>During the game, players need to complete their Orders as soon as possible. For each round an Order is late, the Order’s point value decreases.</p>
<p>Late Orders also affect the player’s reputation with the barkeep, Nasty the Dwarf, which can have dire consequences.</p>
<p>Your experience in managing in the Kitchen and doing Chores in the Tavern will be noted as well which can also influence your game advancement.</p>

<p>Before the game starts, the players will receive a Secret Task from Nasty which will grant them bonus Victory Points at the end of the game for meeting his conditions.</p>
<p>But also there are cards that will make the players' jobs in the Tavern more difficult and they are called Nasty the Dwarf Says cards. By drawing one of these cards the player must fulfill a mandatory task given by Nasty the Dwarf.</p>

 Cavern Tavern is a worker (dice) placement and resource management board game that is set in a fantasy world. Each player assumes the role of a worker in the tavern. Your job is to serve drinks, work in the kitchen, do chores, and on top of that try to keep every guest happy, including the nasty and greedy barkeep. Here's a glimpse of the story behind it.  


 

Unlocked content from the previous campaign
 
 
 




Cavern Tavern uses worker (dice) placement and resource management mechanics. 
Every player has 4 dice that represents his available actions. On each turn, a player can assign his dice to 1 of the 21 locations in the tavern. These locations require different amount of dice value and each location holds a different reward. The players can choose to place 1 die on a location, combine them in groups to receive bigger rewards, or discard them to receive benefits that will help them advance in the game. So when the player rolls his 4 dice, he has a lot of options where to put them and how to use them, thus forming a strategy and reducing the luck factor to minimum.
The locations are divided into 6 sections: 
1. Main area: Players pick up Orders from guests in this section. 
2. Cellar: The ingredients used to complete orders are located in this section.
3. Kitchen: Players can work in this section to receive rewards.
4. Chores: Players can complete chores in this section to receive rewards.
5. Wizard’s Workshop: Players can seek help for completing their Orders in this section.
6. Nasty the Dwarf’s Office: Players can suck up to the boss and badmouth coworkers in this section.  

During the game, players need to complete their Orders as soon as possible. For each round an Order is late, the Order’s point value decreases.
Late Orders also affect the player’s reputation with the barkeep, Nasty the Dwarf, which can have dire consequences.
Your experience in managing in the Kitchen and doing Chores in the Tavern will be noted as well which can also influence your game advancement.
Throughout the game the players can pick up Items that are left by the Tavern's patrons. These Items are located all over the Tavern and the players can benefit through their clever usage.

Before the game starts, the players will receive a Secret Task from Nasty which will grant them bonus Victory Points at the end of the game for meeting his conditions.
But also there are cards that will make the players' jobs in the Tavern more difficult and they are called Nasty the Dwarf Says cards. By drawing one of these cards the player must fulfill a mandatory task given by Nasty the Dwarf.
Here's a great walkthrough video made by the folks of Tantrum House.


Also, you can check out the video of the rulebook with detailed specifics of the game.



Click here to read the rules.

Coming soon. German, French, Spanish, Italian, Dutch, Serbian and Macedonian translations of the rulebook and the cards. These documents will not be printed and included in the physical copy, however they will be available for everyone to download at our website finalfrontiergames.com

<p>More than a century ago, the <i>Ragweed Tumble</i> was a mundane, ordinary sort of place called <i>Goldacre </i>forest. Then, everything abruptly changed when the benign, clement woodlands became afflicted with the kind of verdant overgrowth befitting a dense jungle. The prolific spread of plants and vegetation culminated in huge, vine-like growths that towered the height of trees emerging throughout the forest.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, and the tumble appears to be in a state of flux once more. Though this time, the metamorphosis is far more disturbing and has much more troubling implications. The forest appears to be expanding again after a century of harmonious balance. A surge of violent earthquakes and tremors shake the treetops, causing sinkholes and fissures to form in the forest floor. Scattered reports speak of vicious animal attacks. Paths are voraciously consumed by undergrowth. And, an inexplicable malaise spreads throughout the tumble like wildfire.</p>
<p><i>Linora Luddington</i>, the leader of the forest's settlement of <i>Raggers Hollow</i>, has set out the call for '<i>brave adventurers and intrepid dungeoneers</i>' to seek her out in the tumble. For reasons their own, the <i>PCs</i> have heeded that call. Though, what awaits them beneath the murky canopy of a corrupted realm of trees, magic, and fey remains to be seen.</p>

</div></div>","More than a century ago, the Ragweed Tumble was a mundane, ordinary sort of place called Goldacre forest. Then, everything abruptly changed when the benign, clement woodlands became afflicted with the kind of verdant overgrowth befitting a dense jungle. The prolific spread of plants and vegetation culminated in huge, vine-like growths that towered the height of trees emerging throughout the forest.
Fast forward to today, and the tumble appears to be in a state of flux once more. Though this time, the metamorphosis is far more disturbing and has much more troubling implications. The forest appears to be expanding again after a century of harmonious balance. A surge of violent earthquakes and tremors shake the treetops, causing sinkholes and fissures to form in the forest floor. Scattered reports speak of vicious animal attacks. Paths are voraciously consumed by undergrowth. And, an inexplicable malaise spreads throughout the tumble like wildfire.
Linora Luddington, the leader of the forest's settlement of Raggers Hollow, has set out the call for 'brave adventurers and intrepid dungeoneers' to seek her out in the tumble. For reasons their own, the PCs have heeded that call. Though, what awaits them beneath the murky canopy of a corrupted realm of trees, magic, and fey remains to be seen.


""Too good to miss, Thunder of the Thorn is packed to bursting with carefully considered materials just begging to be brought to life at your table.""
Thunder of the Thorn is...

...A 1st-to-5th-level adventure that is presented over an estimated 160-pages
...Setting-neutral/agnostic and built from the ground up for use with the 5th Edition of the world's oldest roleplaying game, Dungeons & Dragons 
 ...Complete with thorough, lavish, and intricate gazetteers on the Ragweed Tumble and the village of Raggers Hollow–exploring both in intimate detail
 ...Packed with pages and pages of entirely new, adventure-specific rules, such as those used for for the handling of mental manifestations and physical corruptions; classes, backgrounds, features, and campaign traits.
...Bursting with extensive tables and charts that provide dozens of random encounters, events, treasures, discoveries, and more besides.
...Extensive and provides lengthy appendices that contain original monsters, bespoke NPCs, and unique magic items.
...Greatly expandable and easily adaptable, providing fully-developed Side Quests; as well as quest outlines, suggestions, and guidelines–which we're calling Quest Primers.
...premium and benefits from both triple-A production values and high-quality, full-colour artwork and cartography throughout.



While you're here, why not check out our two new 5th Edition classes? We think they're awesome, and we're sure you will too! Click the banners below to grab them for FREE!

Slayers are swift-footed masters of battlefield navigation that channel the momentum from one kill into tearing other foes asunder. This complete, level 1-20 class also offers 5 unique and lethal Slayer Callings to help set each slayer apart from their deadly peers. 

Soulbound are wretched and accursed souls whose fate and very existence has become embroiled with a Cursed Artifact. One of the most wildly ambitious classes released for 5th Edition to date, each soulbound is mechanically and thematically unique based on the physical form that their artifact takes, its origin, and the concept of its creator–allowing for unparalleled customisation.





Thunder of the Thorn itself is due out in July. However, those who want the Legacy rewards offered through Everything DeepDark (Digital) and Everything DeepDark (Digital + Physical) can expect those to ship much sooner.

<p>Our mission is to make the ultimate travel playing cards. After the success of our first Air Deck campaign, we’ve been busy figuring out how we could improve on our original Air Deck. After 18 months of work, and great feedback, here are our five new designs: </p>

<p>For any game designer, the opportunity to work with Hasbro is a dream come true.  When told that Trash Pandas was one of the five finalists, we pretty much felt like Charlie with his ""golden ticket.""  This isn't just because of the cash prize, but if Trash Pandas is selected as the winner, we get to tour the Hasbro headquarters!  However, we can't do this alone.  We need your help to make this a reality, so please join us on this crazy ride and let's have some fun!</p>
<p>Hi! I'm Michael Eskue, designer of Council of Verona, Darkrock Ventures, For The Win, and some other games coming out soon. My wife, Lisa, and I have been working on Trash Pandas for a while and are excited to finally make it available. Lisa and I have enjoyed board and card games since before we met in 1999. Our love for games has grown, and is now a regular part of our lives. We use games for teaching our three children and enjoy playing with family and friends. Board gaming has opened up so many doors for us and we have met some truly amazing people along the way.</p>
<p>As the game developed, Lisa and I were in the process of moving from Tucson to the White Mountains, which led to our first encounters with raccoons, skunks, and other forest wildlife. We were discussing possible themes and the idea of raccoons collecting trash/treasure suddenly clicked – possibly due to the late-night trashcan rummaging which we've finally encountered in our own back yard.</p>

<p>Trash Pandas is one of five finalists in Hasbro's Gaming Lab Contest!  The Grand Prize winner receives $25,000, a trip to the Hasbro headquarters, and the possibility of working with Hasbro to produce the game on a larger scale.  With your help, we have a real shot of making all that come true for Trash Pandas! </p>

<h3>NOTE - When backing the project, please be sure to select the related Perk.  Otherwise, it will just show up as a donation with no shipping address and you won't be on the list to receive the game(s).  If that happens, please request a refund to re-submit the contribution.  Sorry for any inconvenience.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>To make Trash Pandas a reality, we need enough funding for a small (2000-3000 units) print run.  This includes all the costs required to get it in your hands.  We've already invested in artwork, prototypes, and other various expenses so we just need your help to put everything in motion. </p>
<p>We'd like to get the game to anyone and everyone who wants to play it and have done everything we can to make it as affordable as possible.  This means we've streamlined the components, while keeping the quality high.  With more backers, we can increase the component quality even further since the printer gives price breaks at higher quantities.</p>
<p>The main perk is a copy of the game, but Trash Pandas was meant to be shared with friends and family.  Multi-copy tiers make it possible to grab a few (or more) extras so give to your gaming buddies for their birthday.  It also makes a great stocking stuffer so stock up and start stuffing!</p>

<p>The perks of this campaign are pretty straight forward.  All backers, no matter the amount, will have our sincere gratitude.  Every supporter counts!  If you see me at a convention or anywhere out in the wild, just say ""hey SQ, I backed your game on IndieGoGo"" and bring it in for a high five, hug, or both.    All backers are included in updates, so you also get the prototype print and play files, and prototype Tabletop Simulator link.  Each copy of the game includes all stretch goals.  This means that everyone benefits as we cram more content in the box and upgrade the quality. </p>

<p>We've been huge fans of Kwanchai's work since we first encountered it in the game Zombie in my Pocket.  Kwanchai has a distinct style that is immediately recognizable.  When looking for an artist for the game, we made a list of possible artist and decided to dream big.  Not only did Kwanchai agree to illustrate the game, he was excited about it and has been amazing to work with.</p>
<p>Kwanchai Moriya is an illustrator and painter. He was born in New York and grew up in the suburbs of Chicago. He completed his education with a degree in History from the University of California and a degree in Illustration from the Art Center College of Design. Kwanchai lives and works in Los Angeles, California with his lovely lady and pet tortoise.</p>
<p>He has a passion for making fun illustrations, and has worked primarily in board games, card games, and children's books. Kwanchai is also an avid painter, working mostly in acrylics with science fiction and fantasy themes. His other hobbies include making wood toys, playing board games, and backpacking.</p>
<p>Kwanchai has illustrated quite a few board games, including: Kodama, Prospectus, Loop Inc., Days of Ire, Capital Lux, and the Catacombs family of games.</p>

<p>When backing a crowd-funding campaign, there are generally three motivating factors:</p>
<p><strong>Faster: </strong> Backers of Trash Pandas will get their copies before the game is available elsewhere.  You also get access to print-and-play files as well as the digital version on Tabletop Simulator (separate purchase of the Tabletop Simulator application itself is required).</p>
<p><strong>Better:  </strong>To keep things simple, this campaign doesn't have any ""IndieGoGo exclusives.""  However, by backing the game now, you allow us to make a larger print run, which lowers the overall cost and allows us to include more content in the final game.</p>
<p><strong>Cheaper:</strong>  The MSRP of the final product hasn't been fully determined yet, but it should be around $20.  Backers of the game will get it at a significant discount.</p>
<p><strong>Availability:</strong>  We are committed to a small print run of Trash Pandas.  However, the availability beyond this campaign is unknown.  It is not yet known if the game will make it into distribution or where you might find it once the campaign ends.  Backing this campaign is the best way to ensure Trash Pandas will make it into your collection.</p>

<p>Our goal is to cram as much value in to the Trash Pandas box as possible.  With more funding, we can make a larger print run, which makes it possible to add more stuff.  The micro games listed here are super compact, but don't let their size fool you.  <strong>There are no ""deluxe"" versions of Trash Pandas, each game will include ALL of these stretch goals.  </strong>i.e. - With each goal met, everyone gets a MORE stuff in the box.</p>

<h3>Shipping estimates:</h3>
<p>This is an estimate of the shipping costs to various locations for the different quantities.  The exact weight will depend on the component quality and how many stretch goals are unlocked.  I apologize for the higher rates for some locations.  Unfortunately that is the nature of international shipping for a small project like this.  There should not be any extra customs charges for USA, EU, or Canada backers.  The items shipped are under $500 so this should not be an issue, but of course there are elements that we cannot fully control.</p>

For any game designer, the opportunity to work with Hasbro is a dream come true.  When told that Trash Pandas was one of the five finalists, we pretty much felt like Charlie with his ""golden ticket.""  This isn't just because of the cash prize, but if Trash Pandas is selected as the winner, we get to tour the Hasbro headquarters!  However, we can't do this alone.  We need your help to make this a reality, so please join us on this crazy ride and let's have some fun!
Hi! I'm Michael Eskue, designer of Council of Verona, Darkrock Ventures, For The Win, and some other games coming out soon. My wife, Lisa, and I have been working on Trash Pandas for a while and are excited to finally make it available. Lisa and I have enjoyed board and card games since before we met in 1999. Our love for games has grown, and is now a regular part of our lives. We use games for teaching our three children and enjoy playing with family and friends. Board gaming has opened up so many doors for us and we have met some truly amazing people along the way.
As the game developed, Lisa and I were in the process of moving from Tucson to the White Mountains, which led to our first encounters with raccoons, skunks, and other forest wildlife. We were discussing possible themes and the idea of raccoons collecting trash/treasure suddenly clicked – possibly due to the late-night trashcan rummaging which we've finally encountered in our own back yard.


 

Overview:
Roll the die:

 
 
 
 
 
Take the token that matches the die result:

 
 
 
 
 
Decide to stop, or continue rolling.  As long as you stop before rolling a duplicate result, you don't ""bust"" and may then activate all the tokens you have collected. 

With each successful roll, your options increase, but so do your chances of failure on subsequent rolls.

For each token you activate, you gain more cards, or stash cards from your hand.  During your turn, you may use cards for their action, or stash them for points at the end of the game. 

When the deck runs out, players count the cards in their stash and score points based on majority.  The player with the most points wins!

Trash Pandas is one of five finalists in Hasbro's Gaming Lab Contest!  The Grand Prize winner receives $25,000, a trip to the Hasbro headquarters, and the possibility of working with Hasbro to produce the game on a larger scale.  With your help, we have a real shot of making all that come true for Trash Pandas! 
 

NOTE - When backing the project, please be sure to select the related Perk.  Otherwise, it will just show up as a donation with no shipping address and you won't be on the list to receive the game(s).  If that happens, please request a refund to re-submit the contribution.  Sorry for any inconvenience.
 
To make Trash Pandas a reality, we need enough funding for a small (2000-3000 units) print run.  This includes all the costs required to get it in your hands.  We've already invested in artwork, prototypes, and other various expenses so we just need your help to put everything in motion. 
We'd like to get the game to anyone and everyone who wants to play it and have done everything we can to make it as affordable as possible.  This means we've streamlined the components, while keeping the quality high.  With more backers, we can increase the component quality even further since the printer gives price breaks at higher quantities.
The main perk is a copy of the game, but Trash Pandas was meant to be shared with friends and family.  Multi-copy tiers make it possible to grab a few (or more) extras so give to your gaming buddies for their birthday.  It also makes a great stocking stuffer so stock up and start stuffing!

Game contents:
53 cards
1 custom die
6 cardboard tokens
1 player aid
Rules
PLUS:  Any stretch goals from this campaign

More to come...
 
 

The perks of this campaign are pretty straight forward.  All backers, no matter the amount, will have our sincere gratitude.  Every supporter counts!  If you see me at a convention or anywhere out in the wild, just say ""hey SQ, I backed your game on IndieGoGo"" and bring it in for a high five, hug, or both.    All backers are included in updates, so you also get the prototype print and play files, and prototype Tabletop Simulator link.  Each copy of the game includes all stretch goals.  This means that everyone benefits as we cram more content in the box and upgrade the quality. 
 

We are super stoked to showcase the massive talents of Kwanchai Moriya! 

http://www.kwanchaimoriya.com/
We've been huge fans of Kwanchai's work since we first encountered it in the game Zombie in my Pocket.  Kwanchai has a distinct style that is immediately recognizable.  When looking for an artist for the game, we made a list of possible artist and decided to dream big.  Not only did Kwanchai agree to illustrate the game, he was excited about it and has been amazing to work with.
Kwanchai Moriya is an illustrator and painter. He was born in New York and grew up in the suburbs of Chicago. He completed his education with a degree in History from the University of California and a degree in Illustration from the Art Center College of Design. Kwanchai lives and works in Los Angeles, California with his lovely lady and pet tortoise.
He has a passion for making fun illustrations, and has worked primarily in board games, card games, and children's books. Kwanchai is also an avid painter, working mostly in acrylics with science fiction and fantasy themes. His other hobbies include making wood toys, playing board games, and backpacking.
Kwanchai has illustrated quite a few board games, including: Kodama, Prospectus, Loop Inc., Days of Ire, Capital Lux, and the Catacombs family of games.

 

Enjoying a prototype version of Trash Pandas at Flying Rook Games

When backing a crowd-funding campaign, there are generally three motivating factors:
Faster:  Backers of Trash Pandas will get their copies before the game is available elsewhere.  You also get access to print-and-play files as well as the digital version on Tabletop Simulator (separate purchase of the Tabletop Simulator application itself is required).
Better:  To keep things simple, this campaign doesn't have any ""IndieGoGo exclusives.""  However, by backing the game now, you allow us to make a larger print run, which lowers the overall cost and allows us to include more content in the final game.
Cheaper:  The MSRP of the final product hasn't been fully determined yet, but it should be around $20.  Backers of the game will get it at a significant discount.
Availability:  We are committed to a small print run of Trash Pandas.  However, the availability beyond this campaign is unknown.  It is not yet known if the game will make it into distribution or where you might find it once the campaign ends.  Backing this campaign is the best way to ensure Trash Pandas will make it into your collection.

 
Our journey to the Arizona Game Fair:

 



Our goal is to cram as much value in to the Trash Pandas box as possible.  With more funding, we can make a larger print run, which makes it possible to add more stuff.  The micro games listed here are super compact, but don't let their size fool you.  There are no ""deluxe"" versions of Trash Pandas, each game will include ALL of these stretch goals.  i.e. - With each goal met, everyone gets a MORE stuff in the box.
 

$3000 - Upgraded card quality
300g C2S upgraded to 300g Chinese black core
 

$5000 - Bonus game:  MicroBin
Rules found HERE
4 cards included (one for each player).  Bring your own D6, tokens, and pen/paper to keep score.  Press your luck micro game that is perfect for restaurants or other situations where you need a small, quick game.  MicroBin takes Trash Pandas and boils it down to the basic essence of the game so it gives a similar feel.  (Artwork not final)

 
$7,000 - Mmm... Pie!  Trash Panda Pizza Party
Date and exact location are TBA, but we'd love to meet up with our backers to celebrate.  We'll bring the pizza and drinks.  The location will likely be in the White Mountain area, but there is also the possibility of having it in Tucson, AZ.  Given the nature of this event, we realize it's not possible for everyone to join in, unfortunately.  However, if you are in the area, we certainly welcome you to join us as we scarf some pie and hopefully play some games. 
 

$8,000 - Bonus game:  microulette
Rules found HERE
1 card included.  Bring your own D6 dice (3), three tokens, and pen/paper to keep score.  Another press your luck micro game that is perfect for restaurants or other situations where you need a small, quick game.  Microulette is the precursor to Darkrock Ventures, which developed into a full blown board game.  (Artwork not final)

 
 

$10,000 - Bonus game:  Trash Pandas Duel
Rules found HERE 
2 players - 9 cards (rules included).  Head-to-head game of charging up your lasers to blow up your opponents trash cans.  You know, just like real raccoons do when no one is watching.  (Artwork not final)


 

$20,000 - ????
 
 
 

$30,000 - ????
 


The artwork, prototypes, and other expenses have already been taken care of.  The funds from this campaign (after fees) go to the production and delivery of the game.  i.e. - getting Trash Pandas to your gaming table.

 


Currently, the plan for manufacturing is to go with LongPack Games.  They have been great to work with and through our communication, I'm confident that the process will be very smooth.
 


Currently, the plan for fulfillment (getting the game to your door) is to go with Quartermaster Logistics.  They also have been great to work with and very helpful in planning for the fulfillment process.  Quartermaster is associated with CoolStuffInc, which is where a huge chunk of our gaming library has come from and we have always had a great experience with CSI.
Shipping estimates:
This is an estimate of the shipping costs to various locations for the different quantities.  The exact weight will depend on the component quality and how many stretch goals are unlocked.  I apologize for the higher rates for some locations.  Unfortunately that is the nature of international shipping for a small project like this.  There should not be any extra customs charges for USA, EU, or Canada backers.  The items shipped are under $500 so this should not be an issue, but of course there are elements that we cannot fully control.

By backing Trash Pandas, you not only get a great game, but you get to make dreams come true.  Every backer counts.  Even if you can't back at the higher perk levels, simply being here means the world to us!
Some of our previous game designs have been published, which has given us experience, insight, and great connections to the board gaming industry:
For The Win (Tasty Minstrel Games)

Council of Verona (Crash Games)

Darkrock Ventures (Gamelyn Games/Magic Meeple Games)

Coming soon:  Titan Dice (Eagle-Gryphon Games), Ballistic Reign (Level 99 Games), and Oracles (Talon Strikes Studios).



 


We've been designing and developing games for a while, but this is our first real attempt to publish a game. 
This campaign will definitely be a growing experience and we are confident that we have the support and resources to make it a success.  Trash Pandas is a relatively small game, so the production and delivery should be fairly straight forward.
One of the biggest challenges of producing a game is managing the production costs, shipping, and estimating the time it takes to get the game to the backers.  We have been closely involved with several other crowdfunding campaigns and learned quite a bit from their success and mistakes.  Though we are new to this particular arena, we have thoroughly researched these aspects to ensure our goals are attainable.

This is a super useful graphic designers reference sheet to get the creative juices flowing, it is a uniquely designed deck which functions both as a graphic tool as well as an aesthetic deck for cardistry!
Ever get stuck in a design rut and just not sure how to get past it? Our pocket-sized cheatsheets can help you out! This is a purposely designed deck of cards which has a fresh take on the integrating design tools into playing cards. 

It began as design challenge itself, thinking of ideas about how can we create a deck that solves a problem, rather than just being a pretty face. We needed inspiration, and how we usually go about it is to do some online research - this can quickly become distracting as one thing can lead to another and you're stuck back at stage one again.


We started by jotting down a bunch of words to get inspiration and wrote them down on some paper (one idea per paper). We thought it would be fun to combine what we came up with, mix it up in a hat and randomly pick a few then only focussed on those parameters to see what we could come up with. The moment we started to combine the pieces of paper together, it hit us. Can this actually be integrated into a deck of cards? The Graphic Cheatsheet was born, the activity of idea generation became the outcome itself. Have a look to see what we came up with!

With the materials, codes, and clues hidden inside, you must use your ingenuity and match the objects to solve the case.With this model, we want to expand the possibilities of traditional Escape Rooms. By not being dependent on a physical space we have greater freedom to: create complex, different and surprising puzzles, a more sophisticated story and we can make the game reach all over the world.Key Enigma: Hack Forward is an experience as much as a game. Face the challenge by yourself or with a trustworthy group.The box is the heart of the project where you will find the material that serves as a bridge to connect the physical and digital world to live an immersive experience.Here you’ll find some examples of the puzzles and materials you will find in the box to solve the challenges that the adventure requires:Traditional puzzlesSimilar to those found in the traditional Escape Rooms: Logic puzzles, reveal messages, interact with objects, use pencil and paper…   Immersive / Digital puzzles Puzzles that will make you doubt the limits between reality and fiction; exploring websites, news, videos or spying on security cameras. Even in some cases, you will have to use everyday tools such as your email, social networks, chats or mobile phone…  Codes Find keys to decrypt secret ciphers, Morse codes, strange runes, braille, binary code or use the everyday objects like the periodic table or a chessboard to unravel a secret message.  Advanced PuzzlesIf we manage to reach certain objectives we can add more complex puzzles which could include magnets, embarking on missions in the real world, receiving phone calls, among other amazing surprises. Some of the puzzles shown above are examples. We don't want to show you the final puzzles of Hack Forward to not spoil your experience. To make progress on the story, you must investigate and solve a series of puzzles. The enigmatic objects in the box will help you solve the mysteries online and vice versa. Therefore it will be necessary to have a device with a good internet connection and the box.The game can be played solo or with a group of friends, is recommended for people over 14 years old and is available in English, Spanish, German, French, and Portuguese. It is not necessary to be an expert at any particular subject, you just need to accept the challenge and get involved and understand that your decisions can alter the course of the story.The game is primarily a one-time use game like the real Escape Rooms but it can be resettable, to add replay-ability, so you can see the different ramifications of the story or just lend it to someone else to experience.The digital puzzles can be reset with a button on our website. The physical objects in the box won’t suffer damage playing, but some papers will suffer damage, so at the end of each chapter, you will find the PDF files so you can print them again at home.More than 8 hours of investigation and fun, divided into 8 chapters. Like traditional Escape Rooms, the clock is ticking and your time will be registered at the end of each chapter, although this is optional. For those up to the competition, this is the ultimate ranking. Time will not run between chapters, so you can take a break and continue later. If you get stuck, do not worry, you can interact with the characters in the story and ask for advice. They will give you clues and hints to help you move forward.If you want to get a taste of the immersion of the game here you have the chance for free. The DEMO can be completed totally online without the box but it’s nothing compared to the whole experience with the box.  https://keyenigma.com/hackforward/chapteroneMore than 5000 people have already played the first chapter and only 30% of participants have successfully completed it on time. The average time is 1 hour. Can you beat that record?  In our first adventure, titled Hack Forward, there has been a worldwide cyberattack. Massive data filtration has affected from Nuclear power plants to ordinary citizens. Anyone with a smart device can be a target.You will put yourself in the shoes of an investigator whose predecessor has disappeared under strange circumstances. You must continue with the investigation and find those responsible for the massive leaks that threaten the security of the world. But soon you’ll discover that those leaks are a smokescreen for something much more dangerous. Who is behind all this? What could be so important? We can’t tell you any more without spoilers, but if you like conspiracy theories, science fiction and plot twists you will love this one.Dive into this immersive experience that will make you question a real problem. Our personal data is on the Internet and any camera device may be recording you at this time. The idea of ​​this story is based on how vulnerable we are to it. Is technology getting too powerful that it will overrule us?The story will be divided into 8 chapters. Each one has its own objective and different challenges that can be completed in 1 hour, like a traditional Escape Room. You can play them all in a row or you can take a break and play another day. Chapters

<p>Hermetica started when Chris proposed to make a simple yet complex game to Charlie and Lucas back in 2015. After failing to enjoy a tabletop game Charlie attempted to share, Chris decided to design a board game that actually utilizes mechanics centered around spatial awareness, tactical movement and replayablity. </p>

<p>Things were going well after some initial play-testing but it was by no means balanced. The three of them agreed to create a ""perfect information game"" where there would be no luck (dice) or hidden information (cards). As a result, the biggest challenge would be making Hermetica well rounded and not imbalanced. </p>

<p>So, there were a handful of failed attempts that went too far and became overly complicated, including one iteration where there was a ""rock paper scissors"" mechanic when a player moved a game piece differently based on what color the unit was and what color it was standing on.</p>

<p>Then after a year of countless play-testing of the latest iteration, Chris, Charlie and Lucas couldn't find any loopholes or imbalances to the game. In fact, all three of them rarely felt like losing a game was ""cheap"" and no one could find a particular playing style that had a overall higher win rate. That was the sign to take Hermetica to the next stage of its life.</p>

Then after a year of countless play-testing of the latest iteration, Chris, Charlie and Lucas couldn't find any loopholes or imbalances to the game. In fact, all three of them rarely felt like losing a game was ""cheap"" and no one could find a particular playing style that had a overall higher win rate. That was the sign to take Hermetica to the next stage of its life.

Once the mechanics, rules and terminology were solidified the three creators had to take off their game designer hats and put on the countless other hats to start a business.

<h2><strong>Horror Out of Hagsjaw</strong></h2>
<p>Hearkening back to the original days of<i><strong> </strong></i><strong>Necromancer Games™</strong> with adventures like What Evil Lurks, and Aberrations, comes a brand new fantasy-horror adventure by acclaimed RPG designer Levi Combs. Exclusively available in print for a short time in Swords &amp; Wizardry, Classic Pathfinder and 5th edition, this adventure is a must have for fans of Mythos and the sort of First Edition Feel adventures that put <strong>Necromancer Games™</strong> on the map!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575924495/awmva0ttdvzdbzcockoe.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><br/>Travelers have long considered Hagsjaw a place best avoided, haunted by whispered tales of witches and strange doings in the old days. Once terrorized by a wretched coven of witches known as the Karnley Hags, the town was held in a grip of fear that saw its citizens oppressed, its children stolen and anyone who dared oppose them viscously murdered. Though the witches were eventually overthrown and hung in the town square, they muttered a unified curse with their last breaths, promising nothing less than misery and doom for all who remained.</p>
<p>That was a century ago, and now Hagsjaw is little more than a forgotten watering hole on the way to bigger and better places. Time has not treated the decaying town or it’s folk kindly, as it seems to die out more and more as each generation passes. The farms at the edge of town are empty of cattle and crop, the town’s buildings are crumbling and even the sagging roofs of the abandoned, twin steeple church don’t look like they’ll hold up much longer. There’s little left to suggest that the town hadn’t withered away completely… until recently.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575926435/ecif5txhbnywdnypcemn.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>To everyone’s surprise, Hagsjaw seems to be awakening from its century-long slumber. The old sawmill has fired back up again and the townsfolk have inexplicably started to go back out into the forests to log, hunt and trap. Talk of renewed industry is circulating and some say that the town’s cursed days might finally be over.</p>
<p>For all this talk of prosperity, a sinister undertone ripples throughout the town. The locals remain more suspicious than ever and many whisper that the Karnley Hags have returned to make good on their promise to bring their ageless curse of doom full circle. Folk have begun to act strangely. Some have even turned on each other. Paranoia and mistrust run rampant. Has witchery and the depraved worship of strange old gods returned to the land? Do the whispers of ancient curses ring true? What nameless dread has spread its wings over the terrified folk of Hagsjaw? </p>
<p>Can the characters uncover what lies beneath the surface and, if so, will they survive it?</p>
<p><i>Horror out of Hagsjaw</i> is an exciting <strong>Necromancer Games™</strong> Adventure featuring the following perks:</p>
<ul>
<li>For characters of 5th-10th level</li>

<h2> </h2>
<h2>The Tiny Print Run</h2>
<p><strong>Why Indiegogo?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Necromancer Games™</strong> is continuing the use of this Indiegogo crowdfunding method for <i>The Horror Out of Hagsjaw</i>. This method is almost the inverse of how we design our crowdfunding projects on Kickstarter. We call it the '<strong>Tiny Print Run</strong>'.</p>
<p>Thus, Indiegogo projects by <strong>Necromancer Games™</strong> will-</p>
<ul>
<li>Be short in duration</li>
<li>Be limited to a single title</li>
<li>Have options priced between $5-$30</li>
<li>Design all stretch goals and project bonus' affect the principle reward only (usually both the PDF and the softcover).</li>
<li>Be the only guaranteed method to get the premium* print copy </li>
<li>Have simple fulfillment process that does not use Backerkit</li>
</ul>
<p>*Premium means 100 pound glossy interior pages with a thick, glossy cardstock cover. These are the nicest softcover books we have ever sold.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why the Tiny Print Run?</h2>
<p>Since 2012 our crowdfunding approach has been extravagant in every way. Ambitious with massive page counts, plus numerous add-on options and stretch goals. All supporting a primary title itself as many as 990 pages.</p>
<p>This has resulted in Kickstarter's with memorable pledge rewards that include top-quality hardcover books with sometimes dozens of stretch goal bonuses and add-on extras. These are awesome AND they are expensive to buy for customers like you because they are very expensive to make for publishers like us.</p>
<h2>Why not use Kickstarter?</h2>
<p>We will still be using Kickstarter, frequently, for our large-scale projects. These smaller projects are happening in response to the feedback we have heard from both fans and 'almost' fans alike. We hear the request for less expensive options for our projects and products all the time. A second frequent desire expressed to us, whether at conventions, on social media or in email, is for a larger selection of smaller, faster-paced adventures that can be completed in 2-3 sessions and not necessitate a full two year campaign.</p>
<p>Additionally, <strong>Necromancer Games™</strong> is growing in both sales and brand awareness.  This opportunity will give us the additional resources to invest in the very best books in all of our formats. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Project Reward</h3>
<p>With the wishes of the fans in mind, this and future Indiegogo projects will fund standalone projects that are both affordable and fun. This project, as well future <strong>Tiny Print Run</strong> projects, is narrowly focused with all stretch goals adding resources to the principle reward which traditionally would not be feasible for a publisher our size. </p>
<p><strong>Examples of Enhancements from Higher Funding</strong></p>
<p>During the 14 day primary project period for <i>The Horror Out of Hagsjaw</i> and after the $1000 goal is met the focus will be to improve the delivered product. There are no special tiered collectors editions or add-on purchase extras. Thus, as total project funding increases the better the final product will be for everybody.</p>
<p>Examples of the planned extras that increased funding would bring to <i>The Horror Out of Hagsjaw</i> -</p>
<p>Additional commissions for interior color art specific to the adventure. </p>
<ul>
<li>The previous Indiegogo project, <i>Mystery at Ravenrock</i>, added 2 interior art pieces and 3 extra creature illustrations for its appendix.</li>
<li>Printed Player map(s)/Insert. This is one we would love to do but it would require a substantial increase in overall project funding.</li>
<li>Downloadable Options designed for popular virtual table-top software (The rewards for both <i>How Orcus Stole Christmas!</i> and <i>In Vino Gigantus</i> included the new creature/NPC tokens and player maps). </li>
<li>High-resolution files of illustrations to share with players at the table.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Project Delivery</h3>
<p><strong>PDF Perks</strong></p>

<p>Softcover perks will be mailed to the address provided by us via Indiegogo. </p>

<h3>Overseas Shipping</h3>
<p>NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL BACKERS: Shipping international has become very expensive. We understand this. Likewise, some countries charge VAT tax or other fees to our customers on receipt. We cannot fraudulently lie about the value of materials we mail out. We are happy to ship you anything regardless of where you live, but we have to stay in business at the same time thus even our lightest books are affected. In the near future we expect to have a print on demand system in place for everyone overseas, It is not ideal, as the final book is not printed at the highest-quality when compared to the ones we fulfill in Indiegogo.</p>

<p>Total Funding: 4252€ 142%</p>
<p><i>Updated 08:00 01/09/2020 GMT</i></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Standard Template Library</h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Armored Might</h2>
<h2> </h2>
<h3>In the Beginning...</h3>
<p>I found my love for building models when I got into model kits almost 30 years ago, and I've been engaged in the mini hobby in some form or another for the past 25+ years, mainly focusing on Tabletop Wargaming. Throughout my hobbyist career one thing has remained constant, my love for customization and converting. When Resin Printing became readily available I immediately jumped in. Soon after I was using my work related CAD skills for something useful :)</p>
<h3>3D Printing your Modular Armored Might</h3>
<p>This campaign will focus on bringing to life my vision of <strong>Sci-Fi Tanks of various sizes</strong>, and of course all <strong>Modular </strong>and with lots of options, allowing the avid Modeler or Wargamer to <strong>3d print</strong> and field tanks with limitless configurations.</p>
<p>All tanks will be <strong>Printable</strong> in a <strong>Resin Printer</strong> with a print volume of at least <strong>68x120x150mm</strong>, like an Anycubic Photon or Elegoo Mars. They'll also be <strong>Magnet</strong> ready, using only <strong>3x1mm</strong> and <strong>5x2 Magnets</strong> for turrets weapons and hatches, as well as propulsion systems. To take customization a little further, there will be various options for some cosmetic glue-on parts.</p>
<p><strong>#Edit 30-08-20</strong>: Printers with Z limit of 130 like the Phrozen Sonic Mini can also be used (specific files for these will be provided)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Ultimate Goal</h3>
<p>I want to continue developing this line of models with new designs, and go one step further  and offer them outside the 3d Printing community. To that end, this campaign will help me gauge the interest in the design, concept and the potential for resin casting.</p>
<h2> </h2>
</div><div>
<h2>What You Get</h2>
<p><strong>Digital Product: </strong>As soon as the campaign ends and funds have been cleared you will receive 3d Printable files, already cut and sized for Resin Printing in STL format. Please note <u><i>No Physical models will be delivered</i></u>. The STL Files provided are for personal use.  Please see <i>Rules, Terms and Conditions</i> at the bottom.</p>
<p><strong>Core Set / Stretch goals: </strong>The Campaign will be split between a Core Set and Stretch Goals, unlocked by funding. All Backers will get the <strong>Core Set</strong> plus <strong>all unlocked Stretch Goals</strong>, described bellow.</p>
<p><strong>Scale:</strong> The default scale of the Models is  32mm / 28mm Heroic.</p>
<p><strong>Flexible Funding: </strong>This Campaign will run as Flexible Funding option, meaning any backers will get the Core Set Models at least. There is no risk of the campaign failing to gather funds.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>New funding options. Paypal</h3>
<p>Indiegogo doesn't accept Paypal, however, that option is still a possibility. To that end, I've created an e-mail account to handle all Paypal Pledges.</p>
<p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">I'll add a section at the top of the project description with ""Paypal Pledges"" and a ""Total Funding"" line. This new Total Funding will help unlock all the stretch goals.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Strike Fast Strike Hard Perk (SFSH)</i> will have a separate pool, limited for the first 10 Backers.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Send me an e-mail to <i><strong>armoredmightcf@gmail.com</strong></i>, and I'll write back acknowledging your pledge and indicating as well if you're a <i>SFSH </i>Backer or not. When all <i>SFSH </i>slots are gone I'll also update the Campaing that that options is unavailable going forward.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">At 20:00 GMT I'll update the Campaign's front page with all changes regarding funding and stretch goals unlocked.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">At the end of the campaign I'll send Payment Request From Paypal to the e-mail that you used to make your pledge, for the same values as if you were Indiegogo Backers.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">A link to the Campaign's STL Files will be sent to Paypal Backers at the same time as Indiegogo Backer</p>

Standard Template Library
Armored Might
 
In the Beginning...
I found my love for building models when I got into model kits almost 30 years ago, and I've been engaged in the mini hobby in some form or another for the past 25+ years, mainly focusing on Tabletop Wargaming. Throughout my hobbyist career one thing has remained constant, my love for customization and converting. When Resin Printing became readily available I immediately jumped in. Soon after I was using my work related CAD skills for something useful :)
3D Printing your Modular Armored Might
This campaign will focus on bringing to life my vision of Sci-Fi Tanks of various sizes, and of course all Modular and with lots of options, allowing the avid Modeler or Wargamer to 3d print and field tanks with limitless configurations.
All tanks will be Printable in a Resin Printer with a print volume of at least 68x120x150mm, like an Anycubic Photon or Elegoo Mars. They'll also be Magnet ready, using only 3x1mm and 5x2 Magnets for turrets weapons and hatches, as well as propulsion systems. To take customization a little further, there will be various options for some cosmetic glue-on parts.
#Edit 30-08-20: Printers with Z limit of 130 like the Phrozen Sonic Mini can also be used (specific files for these will be provided)
 
The Ultimate Goal
I want to continue developing this line of models with new designs, and go one step further  and offer them outside the 3d Printing community. To that end, this campaign will help me gauge the interest in the design, concept and the potential for resin casting.
 

What You Get
Digital Product: As soon as the campaign ends and funds have been cleared you will receive 3d Printable files, already cut and sized for Resin Printing in STL format. Please note No Physical models will be delivered. The STL Files provided are for personal use.  Please see Rules, Terms and Conditions at the bottom.
Core Set / Stretch goals: The Campaign will be split between a Core Set and Stretch Goals, unlocked by funding. All Backers will get the Core Set plus all unlocked Stretch Goals, described bellow.
Scale: The default scale of the Models is  32mm / 28mm Heroic.
Flexible Funding: This Campaign will run as Flexible Funding option, meaning any backers will get the Core Set Models at least. There is no risk of the campaign failing to gather funds.
 
New funding options. Paypal
Indiegogo doesn't accept Paypal, however, that option is still a possibility. To that end, I've created an e-mail account to handle all Paypal Pledges.
How it works:
I'll add a section at the top of the project description with ""Paypal Pledges"" and a ""Total Funding"" line. This new Total Funding will help unlock all the stretch goals.
Strike Fast Strike Hard Perk (SFSH) will have a separate pool, limited for the first 10 Backers.
Send me an e-mail to armoredmightcf@gmail.com, and I'll write back acknowledging your pledge and indicating as well if you're a SFSH Backer or not. When all SFSH slots are gone I'll also update the Campaing that that options is unavailable going forward.
At 20:00 GMT I'll update the Campaign's front page with all changes regarding funding and stretch goals unlocked.
At the end of the campaign I'll send Payment Request From Paypal to the e-mail that you used to make your pledge, for the same values as if you were Indiegogo Backers.
A link to the Campaign's STL Files will be sent to Paypal Backers at the same time as Indiegogo Backer

We love playing cards, but we couldn’t really find anything that was quite suited for our minimalist way of traveling. When you travel as much as we do, you don’t want to carry anything extra around. Every item makes a difference. We’re big fans of improvement, and decided to create the ultimate playing cards for travelers. The making of the Air Deck has taken us through several countries, and we’ve met many wonderful people along the way. Now we have the prototype ready and we’re proud of the result. Meet our new travel companion, the Air Deck. The world's first truly travel optimized playing cards! Our mission is to create the ultimate playing cards for travelers. The Air Deck is available in 3 colors:BlackWhiteRedAir Deck easily on small surfaces, such as a plane tray table.Regular paper playing cards tear, stain, easily, but  Air Deck is extremely durable. QualityWhile we wanted a compact and light deck, we didn't want to compromise on quality. We went to several of the world’s manufacturers of premium casino cards and asked for the best materials they could provide. In the process of creating the ultimate travel deck, we tried out over 50 different high end plastic materials. The materials were taken through  scratch, bending and handling tests to identify the best candidate. Finally we ended up with a premium ‘casino quality’ PVC that has all the properties we want. The Air Deck takes up very little space and easily fits into your pocket.The Air Deck is incredibly resistant to tearing and bending, and it’s totally waterproof. You can play with these in the pool, in the boat, in the tub, in the rain, at the beach, pretty much wherever you can think of.The cards are 100% waterproof, so you can even use them in the pool or the bathtub.The cards are washable. Liquids and dust rinse off easily.The Air Deck is a surefire conversation starter. Handling In the process of selecting the material we sought advice from several playing card professionals, to help us find the optimal material and design. The end result a deck that shuffles and handles like you expect professional cards to do. The cards are slightly textured on the back, while the front is plain. This provides excellent handling and a good grip. Our goal was to make the Air Deck both visually interesting and simple to read. Design We’ve worked hard to create a fitting minimalist design for the Air Deck. For us, it was key that the cards are uncluttered, symmetrical and easy to read. We also wanted to create something fun and ‘out-of-the- ordinary’. The Air Deck’s unique design will no doubt act as a conversation starter on your travels. The deck consists of 52 playing cards + 2 jokers and measures 87mm X 32mm. Despite the smaller footprint we’ve retained all the features of standard decks. The length ensures that it handles much like a full size deck, and the narrower width makes the deck fit nicely in the palm of your hands. Jack, queen, king and ace of hearts.The Air Deck in black colorThe Air Deck in white color.The Air Deck in red color We hope that you are as excited about the Air Deck as we are.

Your pledge includes the original core set and all already unlocked stretch goals. Wightwood Abbey is a complete, 3D printable medieval abbey for use with tabletop games. The basic set includes a church, scriptorium, abbot’s house, stables, gatehouse and the enclosing walls. All of these unique pieces have been designed to work together as an overall abbey complex, or they could be used as standalone pieces in a variety of settings (steampunk, European theatre, etc).In addition to the basic buildings, we unlocked a series of stretch goals in our last crowding campaign that add even more depth and playability to this already substantial product. For the duration of this InDemand promotion, those stretch goals have been added to the core reward, at no additional cost.The rewards for this project will be delivered as .stl files for use with a home 3D printer or other 3D printing service.Heroes defend the Wightwood Abbey church!What do you get with your pledge?Your pledge gets you download access to the digital .stl files for all the rewards at your pledge level. The core set for the Wightwood Abbey monastery consists of 5 buildings (the gatehouse, stables, scriptorium, abbot's house, and church), the encircling fortified walls, plus all previously unlocked stretch goals.For those of you who want to see what the core set costs in your country's monetary denomination, you can get a live currency conversion here.The core set pledge gets you everything listed below (over 70 models!), that's the core buildings plus all the unlocked stretch goals!- 3 massive models perfect for large interior battles (scriptorium, church, infirmary) - 7 large buildings of multiple levels (abbot's house, rookery, shrine, gatehouse, etc) - 10 medium sized structures (crypt entrance, water pump, smitty yard, etc) - PLUS over 60 components! (everything from wood piles, to ladders, to an anvil) The core set buildings details:The Gatehouse The Gatehouse:""The ingress by which all those who follow the faith enter into the hallowed grounds of the abbey, and the means by which all those who would defile it are kept at bay. Be vigilant! Keep your eyes on the horizon!""A two story building guarding the main entrance to the abbey. It has functioning double doors and is big enough for a horse and rider or small cart to pass through. The second story guard room is accessible by external stone stairs. The roof detaches to allow for internal gameplay. The StablesThe Stables:""They say spending time with the innocence of animals is akin to spending time in the presence of the holy.""A one story building with two sets of functioning double doors. Large enough to hold animals or small vehicles. It comes with two small pens on either side with optional roofs. All roofs detach to allow internal game play. The Abbot's HouseThe Abbot's House:""A place to rest your weary feet after long days of pacing the courtyard contemplating the nature of divinity. Rest well (and don't forget to say your prayers!).""The personal residence of Wightwood Abbey's abbot. A two story building with internal detailing, a stairwell and functioning doors. Accessible on each floor by detachable levels and roofs.The ScriptoriumThe Massive Scriptorium:""Ah, the glorious scriptorium, wherein all learning and copying of the ancient texts takes place. Hope you brought a cushion!""A three story building which houses the monks quarters on the ground floor and the scripture hall in the upper gallery (where the monks copy out their holy texts). The third floor has an inner balcony level with access to a rear external balcony. The facade incorporates a cloister with detachable roof sections for easy access. The upper floors and roof come apart to allow multilevel access and game play. The ChurchThe Wightwood Church:""So very much do the pilgrims revere the blessed church. Its majestic organ, sanctified nave, and magnificent apse bring humility to all who enter its sacred halls. May your devotion not go unnoticed.""A monumental building, printed in 10 parts, big enough for an internal battle. It has an interior balcony (with organ!) overlooking the nave, a tall tower and steeple, front and side entrances, as well as two small and one large rose windows. The roof and wall sections detach all the way down to the building's footprint to allow for easy access and sight-lines from all angles.The Village Gate and fortified walls:""Rest easy my brothers, for the walls were built over a hundred years ago, and never have they faltered. Well, there was that one time...""Fortified stone walls topped by iron works surround the entire abbey complex to protect it from intruders. The main entrance is accessed through the guard house yet there is a second smaller 'village gate' entrance that gives the villagers access to the front doors of the church. The walls will hold but will the men!!Each building comes in a bundle of clearly named .stl files that you can print on any 8""x 8"" (200mm x 200mm) sized print bed. Some parts are meant to be glued together after printing and some left as separate pieces that attach via our simple peg system.  The abbot's house as 3 printed parts, assembled and paintedEase of Play - Each building has removable floors and rooftops and can be opened up to reveal a fully modeled playable interior. Buildings separate at just the right height for internal gaming to be obstruction free, and our peg system allows for easy separation and reattachment of sections. As well, passageways and floor areas have been modeled to accommodate standard 1” bases, so you’ve always got enough space to move your figures about. Game Scalability - Our .stl files are scaled to print at a 28mm tabletop standard (for ease of use with most roleplaying and tabletop miniature games) and are supplied as such. However, we have also made sure that models scaled to ½ size also print properly and can be incorporated into any 15mm historical wargame.The abbot's house, scriptorium and gatehouse printed at 15mm scale (seen here with miniatures from Flames of War)Historically Influenced/Visually Beautiful/Fun - Our vision of tabletop terrain is one of form as well as function. We want our gaming pieces to be able to fit equally into a historical setting as well as one of fantasy. For that reason, we’ve tried to keep true to examples of historical building methods and yet add enough of our own aesthetic to make them unique and full of character making them usable in both your fantasy and your historical games.Printer Friendly -  Our models will print on any standard 8""x8"" (200mm x 200mm) printer bed with minimal need for support material. We've carefully tested wall thickness, overhangs, potential bridging issues and other 3D printing pitfalls and have incorporated the most efficient way to print each part (given the variation of printers out there) into our final .stl files. Functional Doors - All of the doorways in Wightwood Abbey feature fully open-able doors with no obstructions. We've developed our own system for hinged doors, windows, etc, and we're exited to make it part of this product. Watch the video below to see how they work. Lore and Campaign Ideas - Also included in the all core set and higher pledges is access to our .pdf files of Wightwood Abbey lore, characters and campaign Ideas to add to your own existing campaign or get you started on a new one.As well, we have teamed up with Michael Prescott (Trilemma Adventures) who will be publishing one of his mini-adventures based on the Wightwood Abbey lore, and also providing some illustrations for the .pdf. If you're not familiar with Michael's work, I strongly urge you to check out his Patreon. If you love quality art paired with totally unique adventure writing then he's someone you would do well to consider sponsoring. Pictured below is an image from one of his Trilema Adventures, similar in style to how we hope to portray the inner workings of the various abbey buildings.A ¾ cutaway drawing by Michael Prescott from his Trilemma Adventures Examples of Interior ModellingPart of the reason for us running the initial crowdfunding campaign was to raise enough money to finish modelling the interior of the core set buildings. Here are some examples of progress made on that modelling:The Abbot's House w/ Interior Modelling: The Gatehouse with Interior Modelling: Preliminary tile work on the scriptorium floor: Many stretch goals were unlocked during our initial campaign and are listed in the ""what you get"" image near the top of this page. All the unlocked goals are part of your InDemand Perk and will be delivered as they are completed. Below you will see some of the stretch goal concept art. Infinite Dimensions Games, Ltd., was started by James Binnie and Dawa Fruitman for the purpose of creating high quality, realistic scenery for download and 3D printing. Between the two of us, there is over 20 years of experience in professional 3D modelling and 50 (!) years of time spent playing tabletop games. We saw a need in the gaming community for a line of detailed terrain with a high degree of in-game functionality and realism, and all our efforts are directed to meet that need. Our models are designed with the gamer in mind and are play-tested for ease of use and durability. We want to see beautiful, realistic 3D printed terrain on the table and we want to be the ones creating it. It is our most sincere hope that these models exceed your expectations and bring excitement and maybe more than a little pride when you use them in your games.TERMS AND CONDITIONS. Your pledge gets you download access to the .stl files for all the rewards at your pledge level. This kickstarter is NOT for physical product, and access to a 3D printer (either your own or through a printing service) is needed to take advantage of the rewards. These digital files and the models you print with them are for PERSONAL USE ONLY. You may not sell models you print using our files, nor may you distribute the digital files or use any derivatives for commercial purposes. If you would like to sell printed versions of our models please contact us about an artisan or printer's licence. Wightwood Abbey in the mediaAnd in reviewCheck out Wightwood Abbey being demoed at Breakout Con in Toronto in this brief video showing the setup at our vendors' table.

<p><i>On almost on every page [of this book] you will find something to inspire you or a plot seed. If you want to run a Sword and Sorcery game you could do far worse than using this, even when you ignore all the Savage Worlds specific stuff.”</i></p>

<p><i style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>“Beasts &amp; Barbarians is not only an excellent Savage Worlds setting, but a great depiction of sword and sorcery compared to any system. With Savage Worlds’ inherent modularity, it’s easy to add in heroic mechanics alongside gritty mechanics without breaking the system. Creating characters akin to pulp and heroic fantasy is so easy that very little changes from the core rulebook. But beware: this isn’t epic fantasy and magic is dangerous.”</i></p>

<p>A Sword and Sorcery Savage Worlds setting</p>
<h3><strong>Welcome to the Dread Sea Dominions!</strong></h3>
<p>Imagine a land, far away in space and time, dominated in the past by a cruel race of sorcerer-priests, the Keronians. Cursed by the gods, their empire was wiped out by a cataclysm, the fall of the Dread Star, which has thrown the world into barbarism and created the Dread Sea Dominions from the scattered ruins of the past.</p>
<p>It is a world of savage barbarians who venture into ancient ruins to save scantily-clad damsels from a fate worse than death under the claws of pre-human beastmen.</p>
<p>It is a world of chainmail bikini amazons fighting in the sun-scorched arenas of Faberterra to appease the crowds of the decadent cities of the Iron Empire.</p>
<p>It is a world where dark sorcerers invoke the forbidden names of demons in temples old before mankind took its first, hesitant, steps outside the caverns of the north.</p>
<p>This is the world of Beasts &amp; Barbarians where everything is built to evoke the feel of the pulp fantasy stories of the ’30s!</p>
<h3>Because Steel is Stronger than Gold!</h3>
<p>This project will fund the third edition of Beasts &amp; Barbarians, the Sword and Sorcery setting for Savage Worlds. After the first, seminal, Player Guide, the fans and players demanded a more complete game, the <a href=""http://www.rpgnow.com/product/96199/Beasts--Barbarians-Golden-Edition"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Golden Edition</a>, which served us well for five years.</p>
<p>Since then, many things have happened in the Dominions, both in the official sourcebooks and published scenarios, and in the awesome stories you’ve told with your friends around the gaming table, and we decided to extend the timeline by the same amount of time, giving us the chance to introduce new events, sinister plots, events and characters.</p>
<p><br/>We’ve hammered down this new edition in steel, the holiest of metals:  it now includes an extended timeline, new lore, an expanded setting, gear, adventures, monsters and much more - and we streamlined the rules as well.</p>
<p>Oh, and all of this is in full color.</p>
<p>But only you, wise reader, can decide if this blade will be forged or not!</p>

</div></div>","On almost on every page [of this book] you will find something to inspire you or a plot seed. If you want to run a Sword and Sorcery game you could do far worse than using this, even when you ignore all the Savage Worlds specific stuff.”
- Chaosmeister – Chaotic/GM Blog
 
“Beasts & Barbarians is not only an excellent Savage Worlds setting, but a great depiction of sword and sorcery compared to any system. With Savage Worlds’ inherent modularity, it’s easy to add in heroic mechanics alongside gritty mechanics without breaking the system. Creating characters akin to pulp and heroic fantasy is so easy that very little changes from the core rulebook. But beware: this isn’t epic fantasy and magic is dangerous.”
- Aaron Huss – roleplayerschronicle.com


A Sword and Sorcery Savage Worlds setting
Welcome to the Dread Sea Dominions!
Imagine a land, far away in space and time, dominated in the past by a cruel race of sorcerer-priests, the Keronians. Cursed by the gods, their empire was wiped out by a cataclysm, the fall of the Dread Star, which has thrown the world into barbarism and created the Dread Sea Dominions from the scattered ruins of the past.
It is a world of savage barbarians who venture into ancient ruins to save scantily-clad damsels from a fate worse than death under the claws of pre-human beastmen.
It is a world of chainmail bikini amazons fighting in the sun-scorched arenas of Faberterra to appease the crowds of the decadent cities of the Iron Empire.
It is a world where dark sorcerers invoke the forbidden names of demons in temples old before mankind took its first, hesitant, steps outside the caverns of the north.
This is the world of Beasts & Barbarians where everything is built to evoke the feel of the pulp fantasy stories of the ’30s!
Because Steel is Stronger than Gold!
This project will fund the third edition of Beasts & Barbarians, the Sword and Sorcery setting for Savage Worlds. After the first, seminal, Player Guide, the fans and players demanded a more complete game, the Golden Edition, which served us well for five years.
Since then, many things have happened in the Dominions, both in the official sourcebooks and published scenarios, and in the awesome stories you’ve told with your friends around the gaming table, and we decided to extend the timeline by the same amount of time, giving us the chance to introduce new events, sinister plots, events and characters.
We’ve hammered down this new edition in steel, the holiest of metals:  it now includes an extended timeline, new lore, an expanded setting, gear, adventures, monsters and much more - and we streamlined the rules as well.
Oh, and all of this is in full color.
But only you, wise reader, can decide if this blade will be forged or not!

Beasts & Barbarians Steel Edition is composed of two books, the Player's Guide and the Game Master Guide.

The Player's Guide includes:

Summarized descriptions of the lands and the history of the Dominions
Accurate descriptions of the various playable cultures, including clothing, religion, technology and so on.
More than 40 new Hindrances and Edges to create sword and sorcery heroes.
Specific gear (from loincloths to Amazon Hawk Ships)
Three custom-made arcane backgrounds and their specific trappings: sorcery, Lotusmastery and enlightenment.
Setting rules including After the Adventure events, crafting rules, expanded mass battle rules
And much more!


The Game Master Guide includes:

A detailed history of the Dominions, expanded and focused on the last five years.
A gazetteer of the Dominions, including old and new plot hooks for each region, and the new Dominion Events.
A chapter focused on themes, tricks and narrative techniques to make your games even more Swordy and Sorcerish.
Rules and tips to create Character Tales (adventures focused on a single player character).
A fully-fledged character generator.
An expanded Bestiary, including Personalities of the Dominions, the movers and shakers of the setting.
An introductory  One Sheet adventure.

If funded, you will also get an introductory adventure ""The Soul in the Water"", so you can jump into the Dominions in no time!
Both books will be hardcover, 144 pages. Adventure will be in booklet format (black and white).  Covers for both books have final art, but layout may change. 
You can check early layout draft here! (it may change in the end, especially art, justyfing and colors). 
Every order will get either pdf of print version of A print of handpainted map of the Dominions crafted by talented artist  and mistress cartographer Francesca Baerald.

<h3>The Tarot</h3>
<p>The Tarot surfaced, apparently out of the blue, at the mid-15th century in Northern Italy. The first documented Tarot decks were recorded between 1440 and 1450. It is still disputed between scholars if the Tarot was a local invention, respectively a further development of the ordinary deck of playing cards or if it has an unknown, yet to be revealed origin.</p>
<p>Tarot is a trick-taking game, commonly played by four players. However, it is also possible for two, three, five or six to play.</p>
<p>The earliest evidence of the Tarot deck used for cartomancy comes from an anonymous manuscript from around 1750. We owe the popularisation of the use of the Tarot deck for divination and fortune-telling to the French occultist and cartomancer Jean-Baptiste Alliette, better known as Etteilla.</p>
<p>The Golden Hermetic and Fortune Telling Tarot deck can be used both for playing the game or esoteric purpose. However, I would recommend keeping a separate deck for divination and fortune-telling.</p>

<h3>The so-called Papus deck</h3>
<p>Papus was the pseudonym used by Gerard Encausse, a Spanish born French occultist.</p>
<p>Papus was born on July 13, 1865, in Spain and moved with his family to Paris when he was four years old.</p>
<p>As a young man, Papus spent a great deal of time at the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris studying the Kabbalah, Alchemy and Natural Magic. He was especially influenced by the writings of Éliphas Lévi.</p>
<p>Papus was a member of many esoteric organisations including the Hermetic Brotherhood of Light, the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, the Rosicrucian Kabbalistic Order of the Rose-Croix and founded the modern Martinist Order. He also joined the French Theosophical Society shortly after it was founded by Madame Blavatsky.</p>
<p>The written works of Papus include “L’Occultisme Contemporain” (1887), “Le Tarot Des Bohemiens” (1889), “Traité méthodique de Science Occulte” (1891), “Anarchie, Indolence et Synarchie” (1894), “La Kabbale” (1903) and “Le Tarot Divinataire” (1909).</p>
<p>“Le Tarot Divinatoire: Clef du tirage des Caries et des sorts” was Papus last major work. The book has received scant attention in the English speaking world. However, A.E. Waite lists it in the bibliography of his “Pictorial Key to the Tarot.”</p>
<p>Not much is know about the artist, Gabriel Goulinat, whom Papus commissioned to create the twenty-two cards of the Major Arcana that illustrate the book. For illustrating the Minor Arcana in the book, they used the cards of the Etteilla Tarot deck.</p>

<h3>Why this Tarot deck?</h3>
<p>- This is the perfect holidays' gift for the Tarot enthusiast loved ones! A classic Tarot deck in a cute, shiny tin box!</p>
<p>- You can have the deck at a nice price with a 10% discount on both the regular and the embossed edition. Both are limited editions. The regular will be printed in only 780 copies, while the special, embossed, raised high gloss edition in only 78 copies. </p>
<p>After the end of the current campaign, the full price of the regular deck will be about 74 USD (including tin box, printed mini-booklet and shipping), and the full price of the embossed edition will be about 154 USD (including tin box, printed mini-booklet and shipping).</p>
<p>- Black and Gold, elegant design. The easily distinguishable design and artwork facilitate identifying the cards at first glance. Black is the colour of darkness, it represents our fears and the unknown. Gold represents the Sun, the source of light and the strength originated from knowledge. Can't cast a shadow without a light.</p>
<p>- The regular and raised high gloss cards look absolutely identical and both versions are varnished and basically matte. Only turning the raised high gloss cards in the light the raised high gloss elements are standing out shinning. The real difference is in the touch feel.</p>
<p>- Has high-quality cardstock and special varnish for endurance, easy shuffling and handling. The cards are flexible and resistant.</p>
<p>- Handy and classy size 2.75” x 4.75” (70mm x 121mm ).</p>
<p>- It is an excellent learning and study Tarot deck. Everything someone wants to know, including upright and reversed interpretation, timing details, astrological, cabalistic and numerological attributions, is all featured directly on each card!</p>
<p>- It is a traditional Tarot deck based on the teachings of Éliphas Lévi, S. L. MacGregor Mathers founder and head of the Hermetic Order of Golden Dawn (and mentor of Aleister Crowley), Arthur Edward Waite, Oswald Wirth, Etteilla and Papus.</p>
<p>- The Tarot is also a highly entertaining social game. The Tarot game is known as Le Tarot, Jeux de Tarot, Tarocchi, Trumps, Tarock, etc. and it is popular in continental Europe, especially in Italy, Austria and France. It is a trick-taking game that can be played with two to six players. Hands move quickly, it is easy and a lot of fun.</p>
<p>- However, the Tarot is not only a fun game to play but an excellent opportunity to get off from your electronic devices and reconnect with the real world, your loved ones, family, children and friends. The GHaFT Tarot deck was designed both for entertainment and divination and fortune-telling.</p>
<p>- The printed mini- booklet includes both esoteric and game playing instructions. Parental guidance is advised.</p>
<p>- The cards will be printed and delivered directly by a world famous, experienced American manufacturer company.</p>
<p>- Not at least, it is an exclusive collector's item. A modern and exclusive version of a historical deck.</p>

<ul>
<li>Hello!  We're Rockabilly Soaps, a family-owned and operated soap company located on Route 66.  We have been making cold-processed soaps by hand for the last 12 years, and we'd like to join our two of our loves: gaming and hot baths together for the tabletop RPG community.</li>
<li>We wish to provide a unique product to our friends in the tabletop RPG community, and we plan on doing this by offering a bar of soap that has dice inside of it, while at the same time reducing the waste on the world by providing this product wrapped up in bio-degradable plastics to help the environment out. </li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1572721476/x6azclmdl7ykyqmzykjm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>In order to produce this line of soap and make it available on our website year-round, we need about $500 in supplies. Then we can make these soaps in batches of dozens not in sets of 3-5 bars at a time.  Since each bar is made by hand multiple molds increase efficiency making it sustainable to offer these designs and expand the line in the future.</li>
<li>We are the only company that offers a dice soap using traditional cold-processed methods, which results in a smoother soap experience.</li>
<li>We are able to fulfill all the orders received within the campaign length, but we're unsure if we'll be able to offer this year-round if we do not reach the goal.</li>
<li>We are able to offer handmade dice in your order.  These are not 100% perfect, but they roll fairly and have a wider variety of finishes and colors.  If you would perfer factory made dice, please note in the order form.</li>

</div></div>","Short Summary

Hello!  We're Rockabilly Soaps, a family-owned and operated soap company located on Route 66.  We have been making cold-processed soaps by hand for the last 12 years, and we'd like to join our two of our loves: gaming and hot baths together for the tabletop RPG community.
We wish to provide a unique product to our friends in the tabletop RPG community, and we plan on doing this by offering a bar of soap that has dice inside of it, while at the same time reducing the waste on the world by providing this product wrapped up in bio-degradable plastics to help the environment out. 




What We Need & What You Get

In order to produce this line of soap and make it available on our website year-round, we need about $500 in supplies. Then we can make these soaps in batches of dozens not in sets of 3-5 bars at a time.  Since each bar is made by hand multiple molds increase efficiency making it sustainable to offer these designs and expand the line in the future.
We are the only company that offers a dice soap using traditional cold-processed methods, which results in a smoother soap experience.
We are able to fulfill all the orders received within the campaign length, but we're unsure if we'll be able to offer this year-round if we do not reach the goal.
We are able to offer handmade dice in your order.  These are not 100% perfect, but they roll fairly and have a wider variety of finishes and colors.  If you would perfer factory made dice, please note in the order form.


Stretch Goals

Life Begins - 1K stretch goal - Our creepy fey baby in a blossom soap -Scent green apple peels

Death Ends? - 5K stretch goal - a clear skull with a dice ""brain"" atop a ruffled deep purple and black leaves bar - Scent cemetery bouquet

Secret Design - 10K Want to see what other demented things I can make into soap? Good.

 

The Impact

When we make our soups we use only sustainably-sourced oils including RSPO certified palm oils, in our soaps.  
The average person uses 6 bottles of body wash per year, which can easily be replaced with 6 bars of soap.


Risks & Challenges
If we reach partial funding, we will still be able to fulfill orders on time, but unable to do more than a handful of bars a month in these designs.  These bars are time intensive and having multiple sets of molds leads to an increased availability of orders after the campaign.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div> <div> <h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><strong>Why 19mm precision casino dice?</strong>
</p>
<p>The Eidolon Council, in cooperation with leaders in PS2 and Tera, 
reviewed a number of dice options from customization houses, including 
16mm and 19mm black dice, as well as 16mm and 19mm casino dice. We also 
looked at regular ""crystal"" dice from other manufacturers that can be 
customized.</p>
<p>After many months of back and forth, and finally after receiving 
prototype dice (for which we paid), we settled on two designs: the 19mm casino dice, and 19mm black dice painted in a 2-colour purple-and-grey pattern.<br/></p>
<p>We shared these designs in the April 30th Ghost Generals meeting, at 
which 15 people were in attendance. 75% of those polled said they would 
buy dice, and of those, there was universal acclaim for the translucent 
purple casino die. We also ran an open poll on the gotr.us forum the week of May 1, and the results were about the same: 75% in favour of the purple casino dice. The message is clear!<br/></p>
<p>You can see pictures of our 16mm and 19mm prototypes (the 19mm are in
 white, no black dice were available at the time of prototyping) in this
 gallery, gotr.us login required:<a href=""https://gotr.us/gallery/album/115-gotr-dice/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Album: GOTR Dice</a></p>

<p><strong>Why not <em>also </em>another die type or size?</strong></p>
<p>GOTR must up-front purchase at least 200 of these one-of-a-kind 
custom dice, costing about $1200. We have to start somewhere.
 If these sell well - and we think they will - there is absolutely 
nothing stopping us from placing another order in the future for the 
other die design(s).</p>
<p><strong>How is the project being funded?</strong></p>
<p>By you, our members! GOTR will be covering a small quantity of the 
dice to keep in reserve for our web store, to be launched later in 2015.
 This way, even new members can self-serve buy dice in the future and 
have them delivered any time of year, not just during our outfit 
fundraiser.<br/></p>
<p><strong>What am I getting for my money?</strong></p>
<p>Each die costs GOTR $6. You're in addition paying $1 for shipping, and making a mandatory $1 
donation to GOTR to cover the costs associated with running our website,
 the commercial software we use to do so, and the TeamSpeak and game servers. Some
 of the higher tiers have a reduced donation to GOTR. Remember, <u>not one penny goes into any individual's pocket at the end of the day</u>
 - everything goes back into operating everything that keeps GOTR what 
it is today. GOTR is not a money-making business for anyone in the 
outfit.</p>
<p><strong>What if I just want to donate to GOTR and not get any dice</strong><strong>?</strong></p>
<p>We're thrilled you love us that much! Along with supporting our 
website and servers, we'll use part of your donation to offset the cost 
of dice for other members. Your donation may also go to purchase dice 
for people that cannot afford them, or as awards for exceptional service
 to the outfit.</p>
<p><strong>What about the yearly raffle?</strong></p>
<p>We're still going to hold a raffle this year! Prizes include a Star 
Citizen account pack, another 1 pound of teal-and-purple M&amp;Ms, GOTR 
dice, a blank GOTR dog tag and more. If you have something to donate to 
the raffle, please <u>contact <a href=""https://gotr.us/user/11-robocpf1/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">robocpf1</a> by PM on our website</u>.</p>
<p><strong>Is what I see in the picture exactly what I will receive?</strong></p>
<p>No. We are making some changes to the prototype to make the finished product cheaper and more well finished. The photograph in the header was colour corrected from the red casino die blank the custom dice company had on hand to more closely resemble the final colour. The ink will also be in <b>white</b>, not silver, as this keeps the cost further down and matches the factory finish of the 2-3-4-5 sides.<br/></p>
<p>The Casino<strong> </strong>dice will resemble the 
sample serial-numbered 19mm casino dice in colour and finish. On the 6 
side, instead of a serial number, the letters ""GOTR"" will be engraved 
and painted to match the pips. On the 1 side, instead of the single pip,
 the GOTR shield (as designed by TallonHunter/Mitri) will be engraved and painted to match the pips. The 
2-3-4-5 sides will look exactly as they do in the above picture. <br/></p>
<p>(For 
the curious, the cost to engrave all 6 sides on a blank purple die 
raises the cost per die by $2. Leadership felt this would make the dice 
too expensive for some, and the result does not look as professional.)</p>
<p><strong>Are the dice balanced?</strong></p>
<p>For the precision casino dice, all 6 sides are flush and machined to 
0.0002"" / 0.005mm accuracy by US law and general international 
agreement. Our dice will have the 2-3-4-5-6 sides finished as regular 
casino dice, but the 1 side will be blank, then etched with the logo. The 6 side is further etched with the letters GOTR.<br/></p>
<p>Informal testing of a fully 6-side cut die (as you see in the pictures) gave the following results:</p>
<p># rolls  Side #</p>
<p> 100 1<br/>
  99 2<br/>
 107 3<br/>
 106 4<br/>
  86 5<br/>
 102 6</p>
<p>As you can see, the distribution is pretty regular, and all rolls are
 within 2 standard deviations even at this small sample size (1 sdev = 
11.09955, variance = 123.2). With the 2-3-4-5 sides in the production 
die being guaranteed completely even, and with the logo/logotype cutting
 on both the 6 and the 1 side, our dice cutting contractor feels that 
the balance of this die will be better than your average die shipped 
with any board game. He further agrees that the dice will likely exceed 
the quality of most that you would buy from a gaming or RPG supply 
company.</p>
<p>In the interest of full disclosure, should this assertion prove 
false, GOTR will not be able refund your purchase price due to the 
nature of group buys and the up-front purchase of dice required.</p>

<h3>What if 35 minutes could save your son or daughter from serving 3 - 5 years in prison?</h3>
<p>I am April Preyar, a criminal defense attorney in Chicago, known as the JustUs Junkie. For 19 years, I've represented people charged with crimes from petty offenses to serious felonies. Over the course of my career, I've grown frustrated with standing before a judge or jury with one client at a time. What if I could reach thousands to prevent them from ever entering a courtroom? Millions?</p>
<p>I started with workshops. I gained an online following with videos and blog posts. Now, I'm introducing a boardgame which combines all of the videos, articles and seminars into an interactive boardgame. Teens quickly learn the pitfalls that take them out of the ""World of Possibilities"" and land them in a ""World of Trouble.""</p>

<h2>The Process: Tried and True.</h2>
</div><div>
<p>Before bringing this game to your kitchen table, to your family, I wanted to get it right.  I play-tested a prototype of the game on dozens of teens and adults ages 13 to 23. The players were from different socioeconomic backgrounds, from public and private schools.</p>
<p>They played one 35 minute session. Afterwards, they are surveyed about what they liked, what they didn't like, what they would improve and most importantly, what they learned.</p>
<p>Based on their feedback, I tweaked, revised and improved the game -- all before delivering it to you.</p>

<h2>The Impact: Save A Life.</h2>
<p>An old African proverb says, ""If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."" </p>
<p>The bottomline is, I cannot reach as many teens, adults, schools, teachers, pastors, mentors by myself as we can reach together.

<p>This game <i>will</i> save someone's life. Period. It will stop someone from acting out of haste or panic when they interact with police.

Clap your hands, snap yours fingers or bang the table, and they will start to Boogie:  100% smile guarantee: having the dice magically roll on your command makes everyone who sees it smile, and that's what we're here for!Designed to be a universal gaming accessory, Boogie Dice can replace any standard ‘static’ dice in any and all of your favorite games. But Boogie Dice are jam-packed with unique features and abilities that transform them from simple dice into the coolest gaming accessory.    Bots Battleground is a fast-paced, real-time card game that was designed specifically to utilize the novel properties of Boogie Dice. In the game (3-6 players, ages 8 and up), players battle each other with bot cards, while the Boogie Dice dictate the duration and special rules of each round, and power tokens keep track of the score.  Each game includes 1 specially designed Boogie Dice, 1 charger/arena, a deck of 60 unique bot cards, 40 power tokens and a rulebook. See below for more details.For this campaign, we are offering additional special Boogie Dice and the first Bots Battleground expansion. You can play the game with any number of expansions and up to 4 different special Boogie Dice at a time!  Boogie Dice can be programmed to utilize the following features:  Boogie Dice are packed with features that add layers of fun, excitement, chaos, strategy and interactivity to gaming, and this is just the beginning...  Inside each Boogie Dice there is a vibration motor, a tiny microphone, a microprocessor, a rechargeable battery and 3 LED lights. When the microphone detects a short and loud sound, such as a hand clap or a finger snap, the motor starts rotating, causing the dice bounce and roll.  Different behaviors can be programmed into the dice, such as to ""stop listening"" during random periods of time, or activating the red LED while a turn is in progress, so countless new games can be designed for it. One such game is Bots Battleground...     Bots Battleground is a quick and slick player vs. player match game with tons of intense tactics and tenuous treaties. Each of your bots has special specs and you must know when to deploy it for maximum effect. You should also be aware of other players' bots in order to know who to attack and who to solicit for cooperation.  The game can be played with one or more special ""iconized"" and pre-programmed Boogie Dice, which “decide” whether a player attacks or not, and determines special rules for each round. It also sets up, randomly, how long a round lasts. So players must always pay attention to the dice in order to choose the right tactic of the moment, who to ally with, and how much risk they should take.  Are you fast, cunning and daring enough to win? Click, snap or clap your way to victory!     Check out the rules here:   

 PLAY 

  On a full charge, Boogie Dice can roll up to 30 minutes continuously. That’s about 500 activations!Each die is equipped with a powerful 100 mAh rechargeable lithium battery. To charge the dice, place them on the 3 metal charging pins on the charging station. The dice glow red throughout the charging period (approx. 40 min).    By default, a Boogie Dice rolls for 2-4 seconds, displaying a blue light, then stops and glows purple for 1 second. After 1 minute without being activated, the dice goes to sleep.Changing these settings is super easy. Boogie Dice are programmable with sound, so you can pick from a list of different settings on our app or website and use them to communicate with the dice and reprogram it to suit any game you want.  When programming the dice, they start to blink with red and blue lights, then a blue steady light will indicate that the programming succeeded.      And add-on any extra item you'd like:          Nimrod (CEO) is an inventor, app developer and crowd-funding rock-star. His first creation,Pressy, was a breakthrough success, and Nimrod has plenty more great ideas up his sleeve.Saar (Game Designer) is an inventor, game designer (The Agents, King Down), product developer and patent writer. Saar not only comes up with great ideas, but has the energy, imagination and enthusiasm to make them happen.  Alicia (Marketing) is a London-raised, international communications expert. She loves writing, story-telling, building brands and communities and making great ideas grab you by the nose.Nir (CTO) is an expert in all things tech, with a specialism in sound recognition. As a seasoned CEO and CTO of Verbal Machines, he knows how to power both people and computers.  During the last six months we have designed and created more than 100 (!) different models and prototypes.  While the concept of Boogie Dice is simple, bouncing the dice using strong vibration and finding the right power-speed-size-weight ratio was really challenging, but we were determined to make it work.Luckily, we were able to fully develop Boogie Dice, ready for manufacturing. But this is only the beginning... Boogie Dice offers enormous potential to build new, innovative games based on the dice’s unique features and abilities. We already have a couple more games in the pipeline, and the ideas are endless. Feel free to take part in the comments section during the campaign to share your own ideas of how Boogie Dice can add flavor and fun to both existing games as well as brand new games!BalanceWe have taken several steps to make sure Boogie Dice will be perfectly balanced: the components are spread equally (weight distribution is even) and the motor is positioned diagonally (maximizing bounce). 

 PLAY 

Formal optimization will be conducted during final production but we have extensively tested our prototypes and the results have been very encouraging, coming extremely close to perfect balance.Help us roll      Boogie Dice is definitely the most fun product we have ever worked on and we are excited to share the magic with you. We hope you join us on this journey. Thank you. Nimrod & Saar.",36.0,3,"1 Campaign

</div></div>","alphaTUB is your child’s best friend. The patented and award-winning alphabet peg tool brings the letters of the alphabet to life unlike any tool the world has seen. Designed for more than just your preschooler in mind, each letter is represented with a range of symbols that are printed on interchangeable content sheets that slide into alphaTUB’s letter template. The more your child learns, the more content sheets you can customize for them to build on their knowledge.Stimulating, delightful and educational, alphaTUB gives an upgrade to the previous static pegboard we’ve used for generations and allows preschoolers to learn faster and better, while expanding their creativity.alphaTUB comes in two variations: The alphaTUB is made with child safe ABS-grade plastic and the alphaTUB Classic is made with the finest quality wood.

 On average, a typical two year old knows around 100 words, but present-day wooden peg boards limit them to just 26. With alphaTUB, your child is immersed in a world of dynamic learning where they can create what the letters stand for as their vocabulary broadens and their creativity is unboxed.Simply insert any original alphaTUB sheet into the TUB slot, and watch your child’s creativity take them in new directions. Traditional wooden peg boards can hold back the potential your child has, but alphaTUB is the only one that can truly bring color into their world and their imagination to life. 
 alphaTUB is the world’s first and only alphabet peg board with a one-of-a-kind design that empowers your child to associate symbols with anything they can imagine. It even allows parents to dynamically change the content so that “A” also represents ant, alligator, avocado, or even atom! We’ve taken a proven learning tool and created a toy that invites open-ended play and faster, better development for your child. 
 Our kids’ learning progress is a top priority, but sometimes life’s troubles get the better of us and it becomes hard to keep track. With the alphaTUB mobile app, you can not only keep track and share the learning progress of your child, but you can also create and download new graphics or sheets, and even share or sell your content on the TUB marketplace.Your kids can even draw their own content sheets to learn and share with others. With the alphaTUB mobile app, the opportunities for creation are limitless for both you and your child. 
  
 
 
 
  
 

 
 
  
    
 
 
  
 
 
Founded in May 2016, alphaTUB is made up of people dedicated to developing and producing children’s learning products. These products are designed to help children find new ways to learn throughout their growing cycle and create an everlasting bond with parents and teachers alike. After six years of extensive research, and winning the 2017 Edison Award for Innovation in The United States, the team is excited to introduce this dynamic and personalized language learning tool to children.  alphaTUB  is the winner of the Red Herring Asia 2017 Award in Manila and Red Herring Global 2017 Awards in Los Angeles.  alphaTUB  was chosen as a Jury Finalist in 2016 and again in 2017 for the CII Industrial Innovation Awards in India. The very foundation of life and love fosters discovery, creativity and progress. alphaTUB is a story of love. The seeds of alphaTUB were sewn by the love of two sisters. It is a story of love, play and learning in the family. It is the story of two fearless fathers who became passionately in love with the dream of alphaTUB and made it come true. It's a story of the love of a patient wife and an ever-challenging beloved who inspired and marshaled to make alphaTUB a reality. It's a story of the love of friends and family connecting. The refreshing, engaging and immersive world of alphaTUB is a ticket for everyone to relive their childhood. With alphaTUB, take a flight back to the wonderful fun filled days of your childhood. It’s another chance for you to revisit where it all began. Love. Play. Learn.  
  
 

 
We know not everyone will be able to support us with a pledge, so even if you can’t purchase an alphaTUB, if you’re a supporter of alphaTUB, you can help us spread the word on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and anywhere else you can think of! Remember, every child deserves freedom & creativity and alphaTUB can help.
We can’t thank you enough for checking out our project, helping us unbox creativity, and contributing to the success of alphaTUB.",40.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Welcome! This campaign is an extension of our recent FIRST-EVER crowdfunding campaign. We owe so much to our backers, so while production of the miniatures has yet to begin, we are still taking orders to anyone that is interested. All rewards for this campaign can be found below. </p>
<p>-Ryan and Wildspire Team</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Wildspire Heroic Townsfolk - 28mm Miniatures  </strong></h2>
<p> The Heroic Townsfolk are a set of 18 unique, diverse, multi-race, character-rich townsfolk. The name ""Heroic"" distinguishes these from generic townsfolk.  Each of the 18 Heroic Townsfolk are worthy of building deep storylines around and many can be played as player-characters or non-player characters (NPC). They can become the heroes (or villains), too. Either way, they are able to help carry stories. Diverse races, genders and occupations that are not the normal ""filler"" peasants too often seen around town. </p>

Wildspire Heroic Townsfolk - 28mm Miniatures  
 The Heroic Townsfolk are a set of 18 unique, diverse, multi-race, character-rich townsfolk. The name ""Heroic"" distinguishes these from generic townsfolk.  Each of the 18 Heroic Townsfolk are worthy of building deep storylines around and many can be played as player-characters or non-player characters (NPC). They can become the heroes (or villains), too. Either way, they are able to help carry stories. Diverse races, genders and occupations that are not the normal ""filler"" peasants too often seen around town. 

Special Thanks!

I’m a little bit obsessive however when it comes to all the trimmings that are required to play our beloved game. Especially tokens and markers.</p><p>What I’m really saying is I like everything to match and be themed to the race that I’m using. This urge to have everything I need to play that race, to have it all look amazing and match the theme, has inspired me to produce this new campaign.</p><p>The aim of this campaign is to produce stunning and unique items for human teams found in the fantasy football universe. The purpose of this campaign is to design and produce all you will need for your human team. Below is a breakdown of what is included and I’m sure you will agree this is an impressive list of items that you will receive should you wish to back the campaign. Alongside this will be stretch goals that build upon the main items in the campaign. If all that was not enough, and if you missed out on my previous campaigns, you can also get hold of those items in the form of the nine add-ons perks; just add them to basket at checkout with no extra cost to shipping.</p><p>I’ve always aimed to make my items special and long-lasting. These tokens will be produced in zinc-alloy (as per my previous Coins of Corruption project), only this time I will be utilising a 3D mould technology. This gives an increased level of detail and enables designs to come to life. It’s an impressive upgrade from previous works and a worthwhile one. I've been blown away by people's responses to my previous projects; revealing that fantasy football fans and collectors love premium products and feel that they truly enhance their gaming experience.</p><p>This will be the third campaign I have produced for the community I love being a part of, and I hope you can be a part of helping me produce these truly unique items, now, and in the future.</p><p>Cheers,<br/>Duncan</p><p><strong><i>""Since the dawn of time many have tried to profiteer from the popularity of the beautiful game; none more so than the taverns, inns and watering holes that coalesce wherever blood is spilled to appease the one, true, malevolent sporting god.</i></strong></p><p><strong><i>In the lands of men, the most infamous of these is The Spread Eagle. Situated in a wide but shallow hollow besides a cross-roads at the mid-point between the great cities of men, ""The Spread"" (as it is affectionately known), has never been short on custom.

During a mass migration millennia ago, a great convocation of eagles is said to have flown over the lands now occupied by men and, exhausted by such a long journey, collapsed out of the sky. As the giant avian specimens crashed into the ground, the sheer force of impact dispersed soil and stone, forging craters under their exhausted bodies. Once recuperated, the eagles chose to remain and nest in the very hollows where they had crashed. It is these eagles that have ignited the minds of men and inspired the emblems of teams forged out of these areas. It is in one of these hollows that The Spread Eagle is rumoured to have been built as a place for people to honour their legacy...""</i></strong></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1565853206/q4sa0ognvbfh1tn9ivnl.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1578922926/i3rrxmeif2xmlqkopkpo.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Any self-respecting fantasy football team needs a mascot.

Primarily fuelling violence and quenching the thirst of the dedicated clientele of The Spread, Eyrie Beers' murky brown ales are poured throughout taverns and dive bars across the land.</i></strong></p><p>Kegs of ale! Wonderful! This fantastic double-sided token serves to provide you with a choice of ale to aid in the recovery of your knocked-out players:</p><p><strong>Side 1: <i>"" Fouler's Fist - Silencer of wagging tongues""</i></strong></p><p><strong><i>Fouler's Fist is Eyrie's second-best known brew, although not one of its biggest sellers. Brewed to satisfy the snobbery of the more elite calibre of customer from the noble halls of elvish kingdoms, Fouler's Fist is a deep purple and sour beer brewed using forest fruits and a secret blend of botanicals. Often drunk in half measures, amongst common-folk it once was perceived as a ""soft"" drink and was the centre of much mockery. It's very name was derived to make more ""lightweight"" drinkers feel a bit better about themselves while drinking it. Tales abound, however, of the slaughter of a whole section of The Spread Eagle's locals when a dashing elven prince is said to have ordered a measure of Fouler's Fist and demanded it be served in a wine flute. The locals delighted in what they perceived to be a weedy and pathetic drink and began to mock the regal pointy-ear. Unfortunately for the locals, the prince had an attaché of the royal guard outside and a massacre ensued. Ever since, Fouler's Fist's reputation has somewhat changed.</i></strong></p><p>Fouler's Fist, being a relatively light ale, gives only a <strong>+1</strong> to your knockout rolls.</p><p><strong>Side 2: <i>""Captain's Head - For the hero in your team... give Head!""</i></strong></p><p><strong><i>In honour of Guillaume Guildglove, the legendary leaping captain of The Spread's short-lived Sunday league side, the Beakbreakers, The Captain's Head is Eyries' biggest selling brew. Guildglove's reputation for physics defying intercepts and diving catches is only surpassed by lunacy of his demise. In the dying moments of the Inter-Boozer Cup Final against The Armistice Arms, Guildglove rose from his surround of tackle-zones to try to intercept a long-bomb into the Spread's endzone only to have his head permanently detached from his highly sprung body by the clumsily pawing hand of The Arms' resident ogre (and chef) Bunty Pillowpalm. As The Spread were 3-0 up at the time, Guildglove's leap of faith was reported as ""ill-advised"", but received the biggest cheer of the night as the ball pinged off his decapitated head! </i></strong></p><p><strong><i>Captain's Head is a cloudy, chestnut brown, lukewarm best bitter with a perfume of ditch water and victory, tasting notes of dandelion and ditch-weed, and a gritty mouth-feel. It's popularity stems from its cheek warming strength rather than the sophistication of its flavour. Just about palatable to all races, it has become the associated beer of choice for the discerning fan of the beautiful game. </i></strong></p><p>Captain's Head, a much stronger and more effective way of persuading your players to get back onto the pitch, adds a thirst quenching <strong>+2</strong> to your KO rolls to get them moving.</p><p>Simply use the side showing the brand of ale you've bought for the team and stick it in your KO Box.</p><p>The usefulness of the token does not end here; it has a built-in bottle opener which allows the coach, staff and/or opponent to enjoy a bottle or two of the beverage of their choice.

If all that was not enough, and if you missed out on my previous campaigns, you can also get hold of those items in the form of the nine add-ons perks; just add them to basket at checkout with no extra cost to shipping.I’ve always aimed to make my items special and long-lasting. These tokens will be produced in zinc-alloy (as per my previous Coins of Corruption project), only this time I will be utilising a 3D mould technology. This gives an increased level of detail and enables designs to come to life. It’s an impressive upgrade from previous works and a worthwhile one. I've been blown away by people's responses to my previous projects; revealing that fantasy football fans and collectors love premium products and feel that they truly enhance their gaming experience.This will be the third campaign I have produced for the community I love being a part of, and I hope you can be a part of helping me produce these truly unique items, now, and in the future.Cheers,Duncan""Since the dawn of time many have tried to profiteer from the popularity of the beautiful game; none more so than the taverns, inns and watering holes that coalesce wherever blood is spilled to appease the one, true, malevolent sporting god.In the lands of men, the most infamous of these is The Spread Eagle. Situated in a wide but shallow hollow besides a cross-roads at the mid-point between the great cities of men, ""The Spread"" (as it is affectionately known), has never been short on custom. For centuries, swathes of thirsty revellers have made a point to stop by on their way to-and-from games contested by roaming teams throughout the realm.Nobody is certain exactly when the tavern was built, or why it would have been built out in the middle of nowhere, but locals relate it to the legend of the great eagles of old. During a mass migration millennia ago, a great convocation of eagles is said to have flown over the lands now occupied by men and, exhausted by such a long journey, collapsed out of the sky. As the giant avian specimens crashed into the ground, the sheer force of impact dispersed soil and stone, forging craters under their exhausted bodies. Once recuperated, the eagles chose to remain and nest in the very hollows where they had crashed. It is these eagles that have ignited the minds of men and inspired the emblems of teams forged out of these areas. It is in one of these hollows that The Spread Eagle is rumoured to have been built as a place for people to honour their legacy..."" Any self-respecting fantasy football team needs a mascot. Humans are no exception and, in honour of the Spread Eagle's notorious fantasy football team the ""Beakbreakers"" (home turf: ""the Guano Garden""), the eagle has inspired this campaign in many ways as you will soon see.The Team Icon Token, unlike all the others in the project, does not have a specific use. So, feel free to use it in whatever creative way you wish. Be sure to let me know if you come up with something interesting!Produced in a zinc-alloy with antique silver and gold plating finished with coloured enamel. As many of my league friends in the Leicester Blood Bowl League (LBBL) will attest, I’m pretty forgetful. Over the years I’ve got much better at remembering to move the turn marker, but sometimes we all lapse and forget to move it, and sometimes it becomes a confusing mess working out who kicked and received.To alleviate this issue, I’ve designed not just one turn marker token, but two.Depending on who chooses to kick or receive, this will dictate which of the two tokens you select to use first.For example, let’s say you chose to receive the ball in turn 1. In this case, you use the Received token. Now you will always know that your opponent should always be following you on the turn track. If you are feeling generous you can even hand them your Kicked token to use on their track (just make sure they give it you back at the end of the game!).Like all the tokens in this campaign, they are highly detailed and use 3D mould technology to bring them to life. They are designed to fit the recent release of our favourite fantasy football game's dugouts, but can pretty much be used with any variant.Produced in a zinc-alloy with antique silver and gold plating finished with coloured enamel. I’m not going to lie to you, I’m not great at this game. If, like me, you hardly score any touchdowns, you will now have an extra incentive to visit the end-zone just to handle this beautifully crafted, highly detailed, score marker!Produced in a zinc-alloy with antique silver and gold plating finished with coloured enamel. The ball token! This new and improved token is a must for any coach who actually cares about the ball and bothers to carry it - there’s always one! The concept remains similar to the previous campaign, compatible with both 25mm and 32mm bases, doubled-sided and with built in scatter template. This updated edition has larger text for easier reading, tighter fitting to help secure the miniature, nail indent to aid picking up and some nice human team details with the 3D claws of an eagle holding it tight!Produced in a zinc-alloy with antique silver plating and coloured enamel. Re-rolls... who needs them? Am I right? Well, there is some debate about re-roll use for sure. I’m not particularly competitive by nature, so in tournaments tend to go without them.Seriously though, they are an essential part of the game we love.(Top Tip! Placing them onto the re-roll track in your corresponding turn when you use them helps show that the re-roll is spent and can be no longer used this turn.)Produced in a zinc-alloy with antique silver and gold plating finished with coloured enamel. Having more fans turn up to support your team gives you certain advantages in life. That is assuming you remember that you have +1/+2 FAME in the first place!Designed to hang around in your dugout you won’t miss this fantastic token with its doubled-sided goodness to show either +1 or +2 FAME for the match.Produced in a zinc-alloy with antique silver plating and coloured enamel. Just like the Coins of Corruption campaign, this new campaign (and all future campaigns) will also feature a limited edition token. Limited to only 100 numbered tokens, you can be a part of this unique club. Each limited edition token will come in its own velvet presentation case. Each backer of the limited edition will also receive the standard FAME Token, giving you both versions.Got a favourite number? Backed the limited edition Kick-Off Coin and want to match what you already have? As a limited edition backer you will also be able to request which engraved number (001-100) token you get. It’s up to you!Once you’ve backed the limited edition perk, just get in touch via email to secure your number and you will receive a link to a webpage to make your selection. This is on a strictly first come first served basis.Produced in a zinc-alloy with antique silver and gold plating finished with coloured enamel. I love ogres! But sometimes they just will not go and thump that opposition player, damnit! To show that your teams ogre is not responding to your clear instructions, I’ve developed this soft silicone ring so it can be placed over the ogre to show its current state of mind – Bonehead.It’s been designed with the miniature in mind; a soft, durable ring that will not damage your paint job (assuming you have one!). Let’s just hope you don’t have to use it that much.Fancy yourself as an Ogre Team Coach? Well, you can pickup extra Bonehead bands at checkout! Ogres are big people and, as a pretty big guy myself, I understand fully the annoyance of fitting into small places; forever bumping my head and being asked by little old ladies at the supermarket to reach the high shelves for them.This token aims to solve the problem of trying to lay your big guy down into a small space and/or not wanting to lay down a fantastic paint job. Designed as a double-sided token, you can simply use the two sides to show your ogre as either stunned or prone. Beautifully illustrated and rendered fantastically into 3D, this makes an awesome addition to this project line-up.Produced in a zinc-alloy with antique silver and gold plating finished with coloured enamel. ""What fresh hell is this?!"" I hear you ask. Well, as much as I love producing awesome tokens, I also love miniatures. I’ve always wanted to produce a miniature because I’m attracted to the creative process that goes into producing them. I’m in awe of sculptors, I just don’t know how they do it!This coach miniature is something special. As I’m sure you will agree, the miniature looks incredible and it really captures the style of fantasy football, with tonnes of details.Produced at 32mm scale and cast in either your choice of white metal or resin, it’s an awesome addition to the campaign and I’m super excited to confirm that each one of my campaigns will always have a coach miniature included. As you may or may not know, I’m a big fan of casualties in fantasy football. My previous casualty dice project was a celebration of this (the project was well received, and you can buy the casualty dice as an add-on perk to this campaign if you missed it).This time round I’ve produced a beautifully designed apothecary token to show when you’ve used up your only chance to save one of your players. We all know that feeling of having had to use the apothecary in turn 1 and play the rest of the match with no chance of saving your star team member. The fear is tangible, and your opponent is no doubt freaking loving it! This awesome double-sided token is a fantastic addition to this project and your team’s dugout.Produced in a zinc-alloy with antique silver and gold plating finished with coloured enamel. The wizard! It can be expensive, and that makes it bloody annoying when you forget to use it in a match. Not anymore!With this beautiful token sat in your dugout, never again will you forget to zap that opposing player or vaporise that cage*.Double-sided to help track its use, this really will light up not only your dugout, but also your opponent’s players!Produced in a zinc-alloy with antique silver and gold plating finished with coloured enamel.(*cage breaking success not guaranteed) ""Eyrie Beers... for when you're spitting feathers.""Eyrie Beers is a brewery attached to the legendary Spread Eagle tavern. Primarily fuelling violence and quenching the thirst of the dedicated clientele of The Spread, Eyrie Beers' murky brown ales are poured throughout taverns and dive bars across the land.Kegs of ale! Wonderful! This fantastic double-sided token serves to provide you with a choice of ale to aid in the recovery of your knocked-out players:Side 1: "" Fouler's Fist - Silencer of wagging tongues""Fouler's Fist is Eyrie's second-best known brew, although not one of its biggest sellers. Brewed to satisfy the snobbery of the more elite calibre of customer from the noble halls of elvish kingdoms, Fouler's Fist is a deep purple and sour beer brewed using forest fruits and a secret blend of botanicals. Often drunk in half measures, amongst common-folk it once was perceived as a ""soft"" drink and was the centre of much mockery. It's very name was derived to make more ""lightweight"" drinkers feel a bit better about themselves while drinking it. Tales abound, however, of the slaughter of a whole section of The Spread Eagle's locals when a dashing elven prince is said to have ordered a measure of Fouler's Fist and demanded it be served in a wine flute. The locals delighted in what they perceived to be a weedy and pathetic drink and began to mock the regal pointy-ear. Unfortunately for the locals, the prince had an attaché of the royal guard outside and a massacre ensued. Ever since, Fouler's Fist's reputation has somewhat changed.Fouler's Fist, being a relatively light ale, gives only a +1 to your knockout rolls.Side 2: ""Captain's Head - For the hero in your team... give Head!""In honour of Guillaume Guildglove, the legendary leaping captain of The Spread's short-lived Sunday league side, the Beakbreakers, The Captain's Head is Eyries' biggest selling brew. Guildglove's reputation for physics defying intercepts and diving catches is only surpassed by lunacy of his demise. In the dying moments of the Inter-Boozer Cup Final against The Armistice Arms, Guildglove rose from his surround of tackle-zones to try to intercept a long-bomb into the Spread's endzone only to have his head permanently detached from his highly sprung body by the clumsily pawing hand of The Arms' resident ogre (and chef) Bunty Pillowpalm. As The Spread were 3-0 up at the time, Guildglove's leap of faith was reported as ""ill-advised"", but received the biggest cheer of the night as the ball pinged off his decapitated head! Captain's Head is a cloudy, chestnut brown, lukewarm best bitter with a perfume of ditch water and victory, tasting notes of dandelion and ditch-weed, and a gritty mouth-feel. It's popularity stems from its cheek warming strength rather than the sophistication of its flavour. Just about palatable to all races, it has become the associated beer of choice for the discerning fan of the beautiful game. Captain's Head, a much stronger and more effective way of persuading your players to get back onto the pitch, adds a thirst quenching +2 to your KO rolls to get them moving.Simply use the side showing the brand of ale you've bought for the team and stick it in your KO Box.The usefulness of the token does not end here; it has a built-in bottle opener which allows the coach, staff and/or opponent to enjoy a bottle or two of the beverage of their choice. Simply use the token to crack open your favourite bottle.Produced in a zinc-alloy with black nickel plating and coloured enamel I hope you’ll agree that’s quite an impressive collection of items. To help backers understand what is included at a glance, here is a quick summary.Team Icon TokenKicked TokenReceived TokenScore Tokenx3 Re-Roll Tokens (x3 unique designs if stretch goals reached)Ogre Bonehead BandOgre Stunned/Prone TokenFAME TokenLimited Edition FAME Token (if backing the limited edition perk)Team Apothecary TokenBall Carrier Token32mm Coach Miniature (in Resin or Metal)Wizard TokenKegs Token (with built in bottle opener)That’s a total of 15 incredibly unique items coming your way, 16 if you back the limited edition! Both perks will also come with any additional stretch goals that become unlocked during the campaign.I’d like to think this campaign provides incredibly good value considering how many items are included, the quality and the durability of the items, and the fact that none of the items (aside from the coach miniature) needs to be built or painted. They come ready to go straight out of the box and can be enjoyed for years.Talking of boxes, I do plan to produce some packaging for this campaign, just like I did for Coins of Corruption. Just like the CoC I will design and produce the box once I know the campaign has funded, and more importantly, what stretch goals have unlocked. There is no point me trying to produce packaging until I know precisely what I need to package. I’m a huge fan of patches, and what sort of fantasy football team would not have a patch to represent their team? Each patch will be suited to each race I produce going forward, always high quality with 100% embroidered finish. Iron-on material on the back as standard. Dice! Love them. Collect them. Want them! Here we have x2 D6 16mm transparent red gem Dice. The Team Icon adorns the number six side and produced to a very high quality. Block Dice are a pretty important part of Fantasy football; how else are we going to induce the urge to flip a table if we are not rolling them? Produced to match the Team D6 pictured above in a transparent red gem with custom, unique and very clear symbols I think you will find these dice a fantastic part of your collection. There are two types of people in this world, people think dice cups are the best way to roll dice and people who are wrong (jokes!). This fantastic dice cup will ensure your beautiful dice will stay controlled, avoiding the embarrassment of them smashing into your opponent’s fantastically painted miniatures. Finished in a PU leather, metallic gold icon and soft velvet interior, this cup has it all! This dice cup mat is designed to go hand in hand with the dice cup above. Finished in the same way, it’s a winning combination. It will not only keep your shiny dice from getting scuffed from the table you are using but will also mean you don’t give anyone a headache from slamming your cup into the table. Come on guys, let’s not slam too hard. Save that for when you really need that special roll to succeed; it works! With 15+ awesome tokens and dice to look after you are going to need something to keep them all in. This awesome bag is designed to do just that. Finished in the same black leather but with red accents, this bag will really help keep all your treasured items together. As standard the campaign perks come with three re-rolls. However, should £14,000 be raised in the campaign then I will produce another re-roll token design, increasing the items uniqueness.Image is concept level Work In Progress and does not represent final artwork or product. Should £16,000 be raised in the campaign then I will produce another re-roll token design, increasing the items uniqueness even further. If this stretch goal is unlocked it will mean both of the campaigns main perks will come with three unique re-rolls as standard.Image is concept level Work In Progress and does not represent final artwork or product. The Early Bird Reward for this campaign, like the campaign itself, is unique.It works like this: the first 48 backers will get a free set of x2D6 with their pledge. The set will be picked at random and placed into your shipment. There are only 6 sets of each type pictured above, making them highly collectable. So, what are you waiting for? Better get on it before they all fly! The tokens in this campaign go through many phases to become a reality, from initial sketches through to a finished artwork piece. From the initial sketches it is processed into the production concept: a view or target for the finished token. From there it is converted into a 3D CNC view for production. Once produced it goes through more processes, such as plating and enamel colouring. Finally, it is packed up into a PVC sleeve and delivered. Add-on perks can be purchased at the checkout when you complete your order. They do not require any additional shipping costs and are highly discounted, a perfect time to make savings and pickup items you may have missed out on previously.Every game of fantasy football starts with a kick-off. The referee flips the coin after a coach has picked a side. Heads or Tentacles? There are even myths about coaches rolling dice to see who kicks and receives.Well, no more! I’m very proud of this coin, confident that it is at least the equal of any fantasy football community produced coin in existence. A quality item for a momentous choice - kick or receive?Produced in antique silver plating. Being the coach of a fantasy football team is a difficult and frequently violently curtailed career choice. Some are better than others at dealing with the stresses of coaching a team, prowling the sidelines, barking orders and questioning the calls and parentage of the referee. Sometimes they go a little too far…Assuming all is well, this coach coin shows your head coach where they belong; in the dugout. Should they go too far and have to be removed from the game just for politely suggesting at knifepoint that the ref lets their poor little chainsaw back on the pitch then simply turn this coin over to show your coach has left the dugout.With any luck, they'll recover from their 'security escort' in time for the next match…Produced in antique silver plating and coloured enamel. A High-Quality Embroidered Patch for the 'FAS' - the Foul Appreciation Society! This patch is produced to its usual high standard and comes with an iron-on material on the reverse. I plan to slap mine onto my favorite shirt and show the world just how foul I am. Two dice, one 6-sided engraved 16mm opaque white die and the other an 8-sided engraved red die. You will in all likelihood be familiar with this mechanic for your favourite fantasy football game.These dice design shows clearly what the result is. No fumbling about getting the two numbers mixed up etc. In an instant you can see what’s happened because the sides of the dice are specifically designed this way. Should you require more information detailing the seriousness of the injury, you will be able to reference the handy, high quality reference card included with each set of dice. Bribery! Such a wonderful thing. If you have deep enough pockets you can really gain an advantage with these. Foul to your heart's content safe in the knowledge that you can just pay off the referee should they have the temerity to try to enforce the rules.Be careful though as referees can be greedy, and you may need more than one to convince them to look the other way. So spend these valuable coins wisely.You can track your spending by turning each one over after use. The bloody tears on the reverse side of each coin will be a dead giveaway as to its status.Try not to roll too many ones…Produced in antique gold plating and coloured enamel. Nobody, and I mean NOBODY, bribes as hard as goblins do. They are masters at it. Which is just as well as they're terrible at everything else! They work hard to subvert the rules, so much so that the little buggers stole the original bribe coin die stamps and produced their own versions, with some very dubious amendments! They have even tried to dodge showing if they have used them at all - very sneaky stuff - the gits!Never fear though, because the bloody tears reverse side always gives away the status of the bribe.Produced in antique bronze plating and coloured enamel. This add-on is perfect for those of you who want to pickup both sets of bribe coins for your collection. This add-on offers the best value for money and comes with x2 FAS Patches and Wizard Card Decks.  The Indiegogo platform now enables you to buy add on perks (3) when you purchase your chosen main perk (1). Simply add whichever add on perks (3) take your fancy at the time of the checkout process and Indiegogo will do the rest (2). There is no extra shipping costs for add on perks, which means this is a fantastic opportunity to pick up previous items you may have missed out on, because they have discounted prices compared to previously. There are nine add on perks to choose from, so look out for the scroll bar on the right hand side to reveal them all. (4)Coach CoinKick-Off CoinCasualty DiceExtra Re-Rolls (x3)Ogre Bonehead Bands (x6)Bribe Coins + FAS Patch (x3)Goblin Bribe Coins + FAS Patch (x3)Foul Appreciate Society Patch (FAS)Master Bribe Coins Deal (Bribe Coins (x3), Goblin Bribe Coins (x3) & x2 FAS Patches)Standard Edition (Available as add on perk to limited edition perk only)My name is Duncan; I’m a 39-year-old self-employed designer with 22+ years of design industry experience, living in Leicester, UK with my wife and two children. I’m also the founder and retired Commissioner of the Leicester Blood Bowl League.One of my duties as Commissioner of the Leicester Blood Bowl League was to attract and retain Blood Bowl Coaches from all over the county of Leicestershire and beyond. To achieve this, each coach that takes part in and completes a league season with us is presented with a loot item. Previously we’ve had unique dog tags, poker chips, dice bags and, in Season III, a set of high-quality bribe coins. These went down very well and the spare sets that the LBBL did have (due to a minimum order amount) sold very quickly to overseas collectors and are incredibly rare.As a design fanatic I like to think I have a good feel for what good design should look like and how it should perform. This led me to launch my first Indiegogo campaign for my Casualty Dice which successfully funded in under 24hrs and went on to raise 946% of the original goal. Click the image to see the full details on its project page: My last crowdfunded project was the highly successful Coins of Corruption. This project celebrated the darker side of the game of fantasy football, funding was achieved in under just 2hrs and went on to raise £8,965.00 - 326% of its original goal. To say I was pleased with how the community responded to this untested concept would be a huge understatement and I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who backed the project, and also those who purchased the limited remaining items after the project had been delivered to backers. Click the image to see the full details on its project page:I just love to design cool stuff, no matter how small or large the idea. I get a real kick out of seeing people using products I have created, and this is where I hope you, the community can come in and help my vision for these human tokens to become a reality. The plan for my campaigns going forward is quite a simple one. I would like to produce a set of beautiful items and accessories for each race that resides in the fantasy football universe. These will be highly collectable and have limited edition elements to them. Eventually producing all the races is going to take some time, but it’s an objective I’m passionate about. I’m very attracted to the idea of having a custom set for each race you can just pickup and use out of the box, along with all the accessories that comes with it that are required for the game we all love to play.If you have backed any of my projects previously you will know that I’m fanatical about only producing premium quality items – this is reflected in what you received as a backer, you know the quality of these items and that quality WILL be provided again in this project, and into the future. This project does not aim to break any technological bounds, nor does it pretend to be anything other than an opportunity for me to bring my design ideas to life, and for you in the community to have fun with them. It’s in my nature to share and I very much want to share this with you.I’m deliberately using 3D die casting and enamels because, despite it being more expensive, it’s by far the best quality finish and has an increased longevity over any other type of production process. The bonus being that they arrive ready to use out of the box!Backers can choose from two different perks, the standard perk or the limited edition perk. Each limited edition item has a unique number laser engraved into it and only 100 will ever be produced. If you wish to select a specific number, or perhaps to match the number from your Coins of Corruption limited edition, please email me after purchasing your limited edition perk and I will get back in touch. This will be a first come first served basis.After my previous Coins of Corruption campaign had finished, I made a couple of tweaks to the artwork of one of the coins. The response was mostly positive, and I think most people understood the reasons why I made them. In a nutshell I wanted to improve the design and increase the size of the coin so that more detail would come through on the finished item.I would like to state clearly here before the campaign ends that I would also potentially do the same for this project. The visuals you see are the target for what I want to deliver, and as you can see from the tokens that I have produced (team icon, limited edition FAME) as a sample, I can achieve what the concept shows. I’d just like to be honest and upfront that there ‘may’ be changes to items in the campaign after it’s finished. This will ONLY ever be for improving the design and atheistic, never to make anything cheaper or easier for me. If you know me well enough you will know I’m a bit of a fanatic and I’m only interested in making the items the best they can be. I hope you can put your trust in me to deliver the very best items and come aboard and back the campaign and make it a reality.Please also refer to the FAQ for this campaign, I have filled it with typical questions and answers, some of which may answer your queries, if it does not, please do feel free to get in touch, I'm happy to help you. I like to think I’m a trusted member of the fantasy football community and I value that trust immensely. I responsibly managed the finances of the previous campaigns I produced and delivered to hundreds of backers around the world. I have produced these types of products in the past, so I’m very confident in completing this campaign to the high standard you’ve come to expect from me and my Charlie Victor brand. I think the point I’m trying to make is you can trust in me to deliver this project to you; my reputation depends on it.There is not really much in terms of challenges that haven’t already been overcome. I have the design concepts completed and I’m using a trusted supplier that can produce the quantities I need. I’ve completed these projects previously and understand the challenges of shipping products across the world. I’m 100% confident that I’m equipped to deliver this project. I aim to start shipping to backers around July 2020 or earlier if possible. Please consider backing this campaign and if you do choose to do so, please also consider spreading the word to as many people as you can – this is critical to a successful campaign. After the Coins of Corruption campaign closed, I had many people message me wanting to purchase the campaign's perks. It’s great to have these people come forward, but even better if they back the campaign in the first instance, this helps unlock more stretch goals. If, however you choose not to back this campaign then please feel free to let me know why. Feedback, good or bad, is important to me. This support would be very much appreciated and could make all the difference in the future.Thank you for taking the time to read my campaign, and I hope you choose to help me succeed on this passion project of mine. Should you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask; I'll be ready and waiting to answer them.Cheers!Duncan",47.0,0,"5 Campaigns

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Hello. This Indiegogo is to raise funds to create the King Slayer Adventure Path: Part 1 <i>Storm the Gate</i>, for the 5th edition D&amp;D fantasy role-playing game.</p>
<p>The adventure will take chaotic evil PCs from 1st to 4th level.</p>
<p><u><strong>The adventure and campaign guide are all edited and ready for printing</strong></u></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>King Slayer Origins</h3>
<p>I have always been a big fan of sandbox / hexploration adventures. I believe the modern term is an 'Adventure Landscape’. From SPI's <i>The Enchanted Wood</i> for Dragonquest, <i>Test of the Warlords</i> for Companion D&amp;D,  the completion of all 6 parts of the awesome Kingmaker AP, and my own published <i>The Hex Hack</i>.</p>
<p>Inspired by running the Kingmaker AP, I pondered making a sandbox for evil PCs. The result is the <strong>King Slayer Adventure Path</strong>.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The King Slayer Adventure Path</h3>
<p>The adventure path consists of seven adventures, each between 32 and 40 pages in length. The Player Characters will play through the first four adventures in order. Depending upon the PCs' actions and ambitions, the adventure path can be concluded in a number of ways. The adventure path will provide 3 different scenarios as possible climaxes to the campaign, and the PCs may play one, two, or all of them, and in any order!</p>
<p>I will create further Indiegogo campaigns for Parts 2, 3, and 4 of the King Slayer Adventure Path. A final Indiegogo campaign will be created for the three climatic adventures.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your Indiegogo pledge will be used for professional editing of the adventure plus the commissioning of exciting artwork to illustrate and bring to life the nefarious deeds and personalities of the adventure, as well as high-quality cartography.</p>
<p>In return, you get:</p>

<li>
<i>Storm The Gate: </i> a 36-page adventure. </li>
<li>A Campaign Guide for the whole Adventure Path designed to facilitate the engagement of the players and GM into the world-setting. This document contains new Backgrounds, a discussion about playing evil PCs, and a set of simple rules for Kingdom Mastery and Warfare.</li>

King Slayer Origins
I have always been a big fan of sandbox / hexploration adventures. I believe the modern term is an 'Adventure Landscape’.

The adventure path consists of seven adventures, each between 32 and 40 pages in length. The Player Characters will play through the first four adventures in order. Depending upon the PCs' actions and ambitions, the adventure path can be concluded in a number of ways. The adventure path will provide 3 different scenarios as possible climaxes to the campaign, and the PCs may play one, two, or all of them, and in any order!

Summary of Part 1: Storm the Gate.  
The PCs are all evil servants of the Delaxzinia the Marilith. They will be selected for a special assignment that is a prelude to a war against elves and their allies. The party, along with a few small armies, will infiltrate through a guarded valley, capture a few key strategic sites, before turning their attention to the keep of Angrewar that guards the valley.

Adventure Path Summary
Basking in their terrifying success and establishment of their cruel and corrupt kingdom, the PCs will attack and destroy nearby enemy lands and begin to build their own foul empire. In time, the PCs will get to a level of power where they need to confront and exterminate rival demons that threaten their empire; they may decide to overthrow their terrible mistress; or they might seek total dominion over the fallen human empire of Gedal.

Risks & Challenges
This is my first Indiegogo but I have run several successful kickstarters, and have created and published more than 30 items on DriveThruRPG.com.
The adventure and Campaign Guide are nearly complete but require professional editing and deserve more atmospheric artwork.
As this is my first campaign on Indiegogo, I'm giving myself three months to get it completed and shipped.
Future publications in the series, I expect, will have a shorter lead time.


Other Ways You Can Help
Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:

Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign.
Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!

It existed in balance with all things. One by one Mythical Beings arose from the depths, created from one of the four Elements of Fire, Air, Earth or Water. The Mythical Beings prospered, in harmony with the Elements and each other. After eons, the Elements themselves became restless and chaotic, breaking the fine balance of the Island as each Element tried to conquer the others.  The Mythical Beings were forced into hiding and elemental chaos reigned.</p>
<p>The very essence of the Island struggled against this violent chaos and as the Elements destroyed more and more of the Island and each other, it summoned its ancient power. In doing so the four Protectors were created to restore the balance of the Elements, so that chaos could never return. Their task was to calm and rearrange the Elements, enabling the Mythical Beings to return to Island and restoring the balance of all things. Each Protector was also tasked with becoming the lord of its Element and in the end only the most successful Elemental lord could become the ultimate Guardian of the Island.</p>

<p>We are 2 friends, Monika, a Czech living in Iceland and Svavar, an Icelandic board game designer with pure roots to the first Icelandic Viking settlers. Our story began in March 2018, when Monika moved to Iceland and met me at work. But the story of Mythical Island began even earlier, in June 2016 when Monika came to Iceland for the first time. She came back several times as she had already fallen in love with the country. She wanted to buy some souvenir and because she likes board games, she was looking for some games with Icelandic folktales theme, but she wasn't successful. </p>
<p>And then, one day in May 2018 we were talking in the office and found out that we were both familiar with the motto “Life is a game, never stop playing!“. I had already his head full of clear game concept ideas, but lacking the theme on many of them. Inspired by that, we thought it could be a very interesting project to join Monika´s love to Iceland and my love for board games. So we started to work on this idea where stories and Icelandic heritage could be combined into something that could be interesting for both visitors coming to Iceland as well as some informative game for board game lovers. One of the game ideas that I had and was lacking theme for seemed to be perfect for this task, so work on Mythical Island begun in September 2018. We immediately started to dig into all the books and media we could find related to Icelandic mythical beings and folk stories, but soon we found out that many of the stories actually had the same origins. In order to spice up the mix and add more flavor to the game, beings from Nordic Mythology were added to the concept.</p>
<p>It hasn't always been an easy journey, for example when we lost all the game documentation because both the PC and backup disk crashed within a few days apart, or when we lost our brand-new built web page due to a different backup failure. But we never gave up and thanks to our will and strong belief in the game, the game is getting to the final stages. We have done several prototypes and tested them with different groups. Then we made improvements just to test it again to find out that the improvements needed some improvement. Sure, sometimes a frustrating process, but extremely rewarding and fun.</p>
<p>In order to get over the final threshold, we would need some support to fund the production of Mythical Island. We are doing the game in our spare time as we both have other full time job. If you would like to support Mythical Island in seeing the light of the day, kindly participate in Mythical Island’s Indiegogo campaign. Thank you!</p>

<p><i>In an ancient age, many galaxies away…</i></p>
<p><i>The universe is in collapse, as planets and systems struggle for freedom under the rule of sinister despots. Against the malevolent sorcery of the Overlords, stand the few remaining bearers of the legendary Solar Blades.</i></p>
<p><i>What will you do when the forces of the Void close in?</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Solar Blades &amp; Cosmic Spells</strong> is a complete Role Playing Game, inspired by the Old School Renaissance, the Pulp Literature and the many Science Fantasy stories brought to us by movies, comics and games. Based on the <strong>Sharp Swords &amp; Sinister Spells</strong> RPG, this game system provides players and Overlords (that's how we call the GM in this game) a set of flexible and streamlined rules, as well as an array of tools to make gameplay fast and fun, allowing them to have exciting adventures with solar blades and cosmic spells!</p>
<p>The game itself is already written and could be published as is, but I want it to be better. This campaign will help funding the costs of editing, proofreading and will pay for artwork. So the more money it collects, the more money will go towards making the text better and towards filling more and more pages with awesome and inspiring art!</p>

<h2>But What is Solar Blades &amp; Cosmic Spells?</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520363261/l9aailxpejoam8a6uzs5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Standard Cover by Bruno Prosaiko</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Solar Blades &amp; Cosmic Spells</strong> is a Rules Light, Star &amp; Sorcery, Role Playing Game with an Old School spirit. But what does this really means?</p> <h3>It's Rules Light</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>This means the game has only the essential rules to play, avoiding subsystems to detail every aspect of gameplay, preferring general rules and a referee's rulings to govern the almost endless possibilities. The system has only a few different mechanics, and once those have been mastered, the need to consult the book for rules clarification will hardly come up during play, allowing for a more fluid and exciting game. Essentially, you can learn and teach all that you need to play in a single session.</p> <h3>It's Star &amp; Sorcery</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>It’s science fiction, it’s fantasy, it’s space opera, it’s sword and sorcery, it’s post-apocalyptic. It’s all that and more, mixed up and packed together. In this game the party can be composed of knights of a mystical tradition, space pilots, cyber hackers, smugglers running from space authorities, barbarians from a primitive world, engineers and inventors, students of the lost and dangerous art of cosmic spells, or anything in between all this. In this universe, technology is advanced but the great accomplishments of it were lost in a glorious past. Sorcery is real and is wielded by terrible despots. It is also feared by most of the species, being the main reason why the old glorious days are over. Planets and sectors have many different cultures, most of them are now divisive and belligerent, led by these Sorcerer-Emperors. It’s sword and sorcery in space and with some cosmic horror thrown in.</p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520437049/m24ybl9oxoiqhyxk0sfw.jpg"" src=""""/><h3>It’s a Role Playing Game</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>In this type of game, participants work together to create and experience a tale of adventure. One of them, called the Overlord, creates a setting with different characters (each with its goals), interesting locations and a set of events about to unfold, usually instigating the other participants to take some action relating to them (opposing it, taking advantage of it, helping it reach its end or even ignoring it in favor of something else). This group, called the Players, creates fictional characters inspired by the Overlord's setting and the fiction they love, and makes the decisions for them. They decide what their characters say and do according to the descriptions of the Overlord. In turn, based on their actions, the rules of the game, and their own judgement, the Overlord describes what happens afterward, instigating the players to take further action, renewing the cycle. Through these interactions, both the Overlord and the players create a tale of adventure together, without any of them really knowing what will actually happen in the end.</p> <h3>It has and Old School Spirit</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Although not directly related to an old game, <strong>Solar Blades &amp; Cosmic Spells</strong> was designed to be played with the same spirit and style. All the principles of the classic <i>A Quick Primer for Old School Gaming</i> by Matt Finch apply to this game (and if you don't know about <i>A Quick Primer for Old School Gaming</i>, you should google it), although this is not a proper Retroclone. It does take inspirations and is based on many games that are (and some that are not), and other actual Old School games. However, to avoid the controversy of calling itself an Old School Game, <strong>Solar Blades &amp; Cosmic Spells</strong> calls itself a game with Old School Spirit. But what does that really mean, you ask?</p>
<p>First of all, it relies on the Overlord to make judgement calls for how, when and why rules apply (or don't). This is called rulings over rules, and implies that the system has an abstract set of rules to resolve situations and it's up to the Overlord to determine how those rules apply on each situation, or to come up with a solution based on them when needed. Additionally, this game focus on player skill rather than on character skills and powers. The system is very simple and abstract, providing players with characters with a few iconic abilities and very broad statistics. How to use them to create solutions to the challenges the Overlord comes up with will depend solely on them. Social and intellectual challenges rely mostly on the players' ingenuity than on the roll of the dice.</p>
<p>Also, according to the Old School sensibilities, characters can be heroes, but they risk a lot doing so. It's something they can achieve, but it's not something they can do easily with little concern to their safety. The rules make sure the characters are a little more capable than the average person, but they are not superheroes, capable of facing entire battalions by themselves.</p>
<p>Finally, the game system ignores the modern concept of game balance and “appropriate encounters”, preferring the approach of setting consistency and challenging gameplay. In this way, there might appear obstacles during the game in which players’ characters have no way of resolving. Their better strategy could very well be to run, as well as to negotiate or simply to avoid it completely. That’s the Old School way.</p>

<h3>The Book</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>The book has approximately 168.000 words, which accrue to about 370 pages of text. We estimate that the final product will have around 500 pages, with a lot of black and white illustrations. The book will have enough material to keep a group entertained for years.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Why Crowdfunding?</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>My first game, <strong>Sharp Swords &amp; Sinister Spells</strong> (on which <strong>Solar Blades &amp; Cosmic Spells</strong> is based), was written with only the most essential rules and tools to allow gameplay. It didn't provide examples of how rules would be applied, nor a setting for the game. In the end, it had only 48 pages, with a lot of illustrations that were either released and Royalty Free images, or images made by me or some of my friends.</p>
<p>With <strong>Solar Blades &amp; Cosmic Spells</strong>, however, I wanted to provide a game with everything you need to play, and to learn how to play. Even though the game system is a revised version of the one used on <strong>SS&amp;SS</strong> (with some additions, like Sanity rules, vehicle combat, more spells, and other optional rules), this time the text comes with examples to clarify how the rules are applied and how the Overlord can use their judgment. We even have a complete example of play in the Appendixes!</p>
<p>But that is not all. The game comes with an implied setting and a toolbox to create this setting as you play the game. The book is full of tools to help players and Overlords to generate game elements, such as locations, NPCs, monsters and adventure hooks.</p>
<p>Thus, the book will be bigger (<strong>around 450 to 500 pages</strong>), and will require a lot of work from editors, proofreaders and artists, and I want to pay them for their effort. I want the book to be as good as it can be. And I need your help to do that.</p>

<h2> </h2>
<h2>Fulfilled by DriveThruRPG</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>This project will be fulfilled through DriveThruRPG platform. PDFs will be sent as a coupon to add them freely to each contributors account. Contributors who pledge for print copies will receive a coupon to print their books at cost at DriveThruRPG website. The ""at cost"" estimate prices are indicated in the descriptions of the pledges above. It's important to notice that contributors will also have to pay for shipping.</p>
<p>For those of you that are in Brazil, I decided to make your lives easier. If you pledge at either the <strong>Citizen of the Ghost Sector</strong> or the<strong> Lord of the Ghost Sector</strong> pledge levels, I will order the books myself and ship them directly to you once it arrives in Brazil. This way I can order multiple copies at once, saving on international shipping costs.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2>Stretch Goals</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>As previously explained, the initial funding goal will help pay for editing, proofreading and a small quantity of artwork pieces. If we manage to have a bigger support and more people contribute to the campaign, all the funds will go towards paying those working on the book more money, and to purchase more artwork.</p>
<p><strong>US$ 2,000.00</strong> - Initial funding goal. - <strong>ACHIEVED</strong></p>
<p><strong>US$ 3,000.00</strong> - Pay our editor and proofreader more and commission more artwork pieces. - <strong>ACHIEVED</strong></p>
<p><strong>US$ 4,000.00</strong> - Pay our editor and proofreader more and commission even more artwork pieces. - <strong>ACHIEVED</strong></p>
<p><strong>US$ 5,000.00</strong> - Pay our editor and proofreader the amount they deserve, and we will commission 5 pages of comics to use as an introduction for the game. - <strong>ACHIEVED</strong></p>
<p>If, somehow, we actually get more pledges accruing more than US$ 5,000.00, we will work something out, commissioning more artwork, making a art free version of the book available for free, designing archetype specific character sheets or something else that won't delay the production of the actual book.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>But what will we do after that? How about two new Stretch Goals?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>US$ 6,500</strong> - We will get even <strong>more illustrations commissioned</strong> and will make a <strong>Reference Booklet</strong> with just the rules of the game. This will make looking up rules and results of tables easier and faster. Every backer will get it in PDF, and every backer of print copies will get a coupon to print it “at cost” too. Backers from Brazil who got any of the pledges from the “Ghost Sector” can add 10 dollars if they want the Reference Booklet printed and sent to them too. The delivery date of the Reference Booklet will be a few months after the core book, so around March 2019. That’s just to be safe. - <strong>ACHIEVED</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>US$ 7,000 </strong>- <strong>Andre Novoa</strong>, author of <strong>The Squid, The Cabal, and The Old Man</strong> for Lamentations of the Flame Princess, <strong>will write an Adventure Module for SB&amp;CS</strong>. All backers will receive a PDF of the adventure, and the ones who are getting print coupons will also receive a “print at cost” coupon for the adventure. Brazilian backers will have the option to pay a little more to receive the adventure with the corebook (but that may delay the delivery of it). The module will be published separately from the Core Book not to delay its release. - <strong>ACHIEVED</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>US$ 8,000</strong> - <strong>More Illustrations commissioned</strong>! Additionally we will make an <strong>art free version of the book’s PDF</strong>! This way we can make the game more accessible and you can send the art free PDF to players and friends so they can read it and get ready for the game! It will be completely free! - <strong>So Close! WTH... ACHIEVED</strong><br/><br/>I have a few more surprises in store for you guys! Let's see if we can make them happen!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Risks and Challenges</h2>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1520470522/gxgyqub7twrdgxgtzuzy.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Crowdfunding seems a lot more risky than simply buying a ready made book, right? But this also allows creators to make the final product much better than if they just used the funds they have at hand. My first RPG, <strong>Sharp Swords &amp; Sinister Spells</strong> (and it's <strong>Addendum</strong>) were published without a crowdfunding campaign. Booth of them had less than 100 pages and could count on a large amount of royalty free or accessible stock art supply.</p>
<p><strong>Solar Blades &amp; Cosmic Spells</strong>, however, is a science fantasy RPG with some very specific influences. Finding stock art appropriate to the feeling of the book isn't an easy task. That's why this crowdfunding campaign is important.</p>
<p>All in all, the risk is minimum, since the text is already done and all that we will need to do after the campaign ends is to get the awesome artwork our artists will produce and put it into the book itself, with a clean and easy to read design.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition to contributing money to the campaign, you can help the project by sharing the campaign's URL on social media, telling your friends about the project and playing the game in your local game stores and conventions. The more people know about the project, the better chances we get at producing an even better product in the end! Everyone wins!</p>
<p>Grab your solar blade, ready your cosmic spells and spread the word!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Artist Credits</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>In this campaign we used the artwork of the following artists: <strong>Bruno Prosaiko</strong>, <strong>Diogo Nogueira</strong>, <strong>Dan Ramos</strong>, <strong>Jeshields</strong>, <strong>Maciej Zagorski</strong> (The Forge Studios), <strong>Lucas Bigorenski</strong>, <strong>Bradley K. McDevitt</strong>.</p>

</div></div>","In an ancient age, many galaxies away…
The universe is in collapse, as planets and systems struggle for freedom under the rule of sinister despots. Against the malevolent sorcery of the Overlords, stand the few remaining bearers of the legendary Solar Blades.
What will you do when the forces of the Void close in?
 
Solar Blades & Cosmic Spells is a complete Role Playing Game, inspired by the Old School Renaissance, the Pulp Literature and the many Science Fantasy stories brought to us by movies, comics and games. Based on the Sharp Swords & Sinister Spells RPG, this game system provides players and Overlords (that's how we call the GM in this game) a set of flexible and streamlined rules, as well as an array of tools to make gameplay fast and fun, allowing them to have exciting adventures with solar blades and cosmic spells!
The game itself is already written and could be published as is, but I want it to be better. This campaign will help funding the costs of editing, proofreading and will pay for artwork. So the more money it collects, the more money will go towards making the text better and towards filling more and more pages with awesome and inspiring art!
 
But What is Solar Blades & Cosmic Spells?
 

Standard Cover by Bruno Prosaiko
 
Solar Blades & Cosmic Spells is a Rules Light, Star & Sorcery, Role Playing Game with an Old School spirit. But what does this really means? It's Rules Light
 
This means the game has only the essential rules to play, avoiding subsystems to detail every aspect of gameplay, preferring general rules and a referee's rulings to govern the almost endless possibilities. The system has only a few different mechanics, and once those have been mastered, the need to consult the book for rules clarification will hardly come up during play, allowing for a more fluid and exciting game. Essentially, you can learn and teach all that you need to play in a single session. It's Star & Sorcery
 
It’s science fiction, it’s fantasy, it’s space opera, it’s sword and sorcery, it’s post-apocalyptic. It’s all that and more, mixed up and packed together. In this game the party can be composed of knights of a mystical tradition, space pilots, cyber hackers, smugglers running from space authorities, barbarians from a primitive world, engineers and inventors, students of the lost and dangerous art of cosmic spells, or anything in between all this. In this universe, technology is advanced but the great accomplishments of it were lost in a glorious past. Sorcery is real and is wielded by terrible despots. It is also feared by most of the species, being the main reason why the old glorious days are over. Planets and sectors have many different cultures, most of them are now divisive and belligerent, led by these Sorcerer-Emperors. It’s sword and sorcery in space and with some cosmic horror thrown in.
It’s a Role Playing Game
 
In this type of game, participants work together to create and experience a tale of adventure. One of them, called the Overlord, creates a setting with different characters (each with its goals), interesting locations and a set of events about to unfold, usually instigating the other participants to take some action relating to them (opposing it, taking advantage of it, helping it reach its end or even ignoring it in favor of something else). This group, called the Players, creates fictional characters inspired by the Overlord's setting and the fiction they love, and makes the decisions for them. They decide what their characters say and do according to the descriptions of the Overlord. In turn, based on their actions, the rules of the game, and their own judgement, the Overlord describes what happens afterward, instigating the players to take further action, renewing the cycle. Through these interactions, both the Overlord and the players create a tale of adventure together, without any of them really knowing what will actually happen in the end. It has and Old School Spirit
 
Although not directly related to an old game, Solar Blades & Cosmic Spells was designed to be played with the same spirit and style. All the principles of the classic A Quick Primer for Old School Gaming by Matt Finch apply to this game (and if you don't know about A Quick Primer for Old School Gaming, you should google it), although this is not a proper Retroclone. It does take inspirations and is based on many games that are (and some that are not), and other actual Old School games. However, to avoid the controversy of calling itself an Old School Game, Solar Blades & Cosmic Spells calls itself a game with Old School Spirit. But what does that really mean, you ask?
First of all, it relies on the Overlord to make judgement calls for how, when and why rules apply (or don't). This is called rulings over rules, and implies that the system has an abstract set of rules to resolve situations and it's up to the Overlord to determine how those rules apply on each situation, or to come up with a solution based on them when needed. Additionally, this game focus on player skill rather than on character skills and powers. The system is very simple and abstract, providing players with characters with a few iconic abilities and very broad statistics. How to use them to create solutions to the challenges the Overlord comes up with will depend solely on them. Social and intellectual challenges rely mostly on the players' ingenuity than on the roll of the dice.
Also, according to the Old School sensibilities, characters can be heroes, but they risk a lot doing so. It's something they can achieve, but it's not something they can do easily with little concern to their safety. The rules make sure the characters are a little more capable than the average person, but they are not superheroes, capable of facing entire battalions by themselves.
Finally, the game system ignores the modern concept of game balance and “appropriate encounters”, preferring the approach of setting consistency and challenging gameplay. In this way, there might appear obstacles during the game in which players’ characters have no way of resolving. Their better strategy could very well be to run, as well as to negotiate or simply to avoid it completely. That’s the Old School way.
 

 
The Book
 
The book has approximately 168.000 words, which accrue to about 370 pages of text. We estimate that the final product will have around 500 pages, with a lot of black and white illustrations. The book will have enough material to keep a group entertained for years.
 
Why Crowdfunding?
 
My first game, Sharp Swords & Sinister Spells (on which Solar Blades & Cosmic Spells is based), was written with only the most essential rules and tools to allow gameplay. It didn't provide examples of how rules would be applied, nor a setting for the game. In the end, it had only 48 pages, with a lot of illustrations that were either released and Royalty Free images, or images made by me or some of my friends.
With Solar Blades & Cosmic Spells, however, I wanted to provide a game with everything you need to play, and to learn how to play. Even though the game system is a revised version of the one used on SS&SS (with some additions, like Sanity rules, vehicle combat, more spells, and other optional rules), this time the text comes with examples to clarify how the rules are applied and how the Overlord can use their judgment. We even have a complete example of play in the Appendixes!
But that is not all. The game comes with an implied setting and a toolbox to create this setting as you play the game. The book is full of tools to help players and Overlords to generate game elements, such as locations, NPCs, monsters and adventure hooks.
Thus, the book will be bigger (around 450 to 500 pages), and will require a lot of work from editors, proofreaders and artists, and I want to pay them for their effort. I want the book to be as good as it can be. And I need your help to do that.

The delivery date of the Reference Booklet will be a few months after the core book, so around March 2019. That’s just to be safe. - ACHIEVED
 
US$ 7,000 - Andre Novoa, author of The Squid, The Cabal, and The Old Man for Lamentations of the Flame Princess, will write an Adventure Module for SB&CS. All backers will receive a PDF of the adventure, and the ones who are getting print coupons will also receive a “print at cost” coupon for the adventure. Brazilian backers will have the option to pay a little more to receive the adventure with the corebook (but that may delay the delivery of it). The module will be published separately from the Core Book not to delay its release. - ACHIEVED
 
US$ 8,000 - More Illustrations commissioned! Additionally we will make an art free version of the book’s PDF! This way we can make the game more accessible and you can send the art free PDF to players and friends so they can read it and get ready for the game! It will be completely free! - So Close! WTH... ACHIEVEDI have a few more surprises in store for you guys! Let's see if we can make them happen!
 
Risks and Challenges
 

 
Crowdfunding seems a lot more risky than simply buying a ready made book, right? But this also allows creators to make the final product much better than if they just used the funds they have at hand. My first RPG, Sharp Swords & Sinister Spells (and it's Addendum) were published without a crowdfunding campaign. Booth of them had less than 100 pages and could count on a large amount of royalty free or accessible stock art supply.
Solar Blades & Cosmic Spells, however, is a science fantasy RPG with some very specific influences. Finding stock art appropriate to the feeling of the book isn't an easy task. That's why this crowdfunding campaign is important.
All in all, the risk is minimum, since the text is already done and all that we will need to do after the campaign ends is to get the awesome artwork our artists will produce and put it into the book itself, with a clean and easy to read design.
 
Other Ways You Can Help
 
In addition to contributing money to the campaign, you can help the project by sharing the campaign's URL on social media, telling your friends about the project and playing the game in your local game stores and conventions. The more people know about the project, the better chances we get at producing an even better product in the end! Everyone wins!
Grab your solar blade, ready your cosmic spells and spread the word!

<u><strong>Our Game's Story</strong></u><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590840802/tq1rvqkzutkm2yqo2ouq.png"" src=""""/>
</h2>
<p>Recipe Roundup is a card game whose purpose is to learn about the ingredients that make up delicious, healthy meals. Chefs collect the necessary ingredients to complete the perfect recipes. Ingredients are limited so the competition can be dicey. Chefs can strategically stock ingredients in their pantry, while others are left for their friends to “borrow”. If another Chef poaches your key ingredient, you’ll have to scramble or you’ll be in hot water. Chefs can expand their palette with new recipes, but beware of holding too many ingredients or you’ll be left holding the bag (of wasted food).</p>
<p>The origin story of Recipe Roundup begins on a cross-country road trip. Somewhere between the Rocky Mountains and the Great Lakes, amid the license plate games and existential questions, my then-not-yet-future-but-now wife inspired me to make a game about healthy food. It’s no coincidence that traveling inspired us to talk about food, as those are two ways we spend much of our free time. Traveling offers amazing opportunities to meet people, experience their traditions, and get a taste of their culture - especially through food!  Having been able to visit so many different countries shows how much people have in common, and also provides a refreshing new perspective on things close to home. You’ve probably eaten banana and pineapple, but have you seen a banana tree forest or pineapple fields? Did you know there are 7,500+ varieties of tomatoes? While we couldn’t fit all of them into this game, I hope that it sparks your curiosity to learn something new about your favorite foods, and maybe find some inspiration for a new recipe to test out.</p>
<p>Tiny Earth Games was founded by Robert Pierce in 2020 to develop games that use science and reason to instill a sense of wonder and purpose in the tiny Earth we call home. Recipe Roundup was developed in partnership with Amanda Barnes, Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN).<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590840823/eyfk6hxq2grgin8x6xrl.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Set-up:</h3>
<p>Ingredient cards are shuffled and 6 cards are dealt to each player – their “Kitchen.” Players may keep up to 5 Ingredients in their hand - their “Pantry”, but any excess must be left face up – their “Counter.” The rest of the Ingredient deck is placed face down – the “Store.” The top card is flipped face up next to the Store. The Recipe deck is shuffled and 2 cards are dealt to each player. Players may keep all Recipes in their Pantry. The remaining Recipes are placed face down next to the Ingredients - the “Cookbook”.</p>
<h3>Gameplay: </h3>
<p>Play starts to the left of the dealer, going clockwise.</p>
<p><i>Step 1.</i> Prep: Players begin their turn by choosing to select Ingredients or Recipes. A player may select an Ingredient from the Store,</p>
<ul>
<li>If a player chooses from the Store, they may either draw the 1 face up Ingredient, or 2 face down Ingredients into your Kitchen; or,</li>
<li>A player may borrow 1 Ingredient from any friend’s Counter. (Player may choose to place the Ingredient in their Pantry or Counter, but beware your friend borrowing it right back!).</li>
</ul>
<p>Or, if a player selects Recipes, they draw 2 into their Pantry.</p>
<p><i>Step 2.</i> Cook: When a player has collected the Ingredients to match the list of Ingredients on their Recipe, they can Cook their Recipe by playing their Ingredients and Recipe face up in front of them. Once Cooked, the Ingredients can’t be moved to any other Recipe or replaced by any other Ingredient.</p>
<p><i>Step 3.</i> Clean up: Players end their turn by organizing their Kitchen, so that no more than 5 Ingredients are in the Pantry. The rest remain on the Counter for friends to borrow. Players may move Ingredients between the Pantry and the Counter.</p>
<h3>Ending:</h3>
<p>Play continues until the last Ingredient is selected from the Store. Then each player gets one final turn and last chance to cook.</p>

Recipe Roundup is a card game whose purpose is to learn about the ingredients that make up delicious, healthy meals. Chefs collect the necessary ingredients to complete the perfect recipes. Ingredients are limited so the competition can be dicey. Chefs can strategically stock ingredients in their pantry, while others are left for their friends to “borrow”. If another Chef poaches your key ingredient, you’ll have to scramble or you’ll be in hot water. Chefs can expand their palette with new recipes, but beware of holding too many ingredients or you’ll be left holding the bag (of wasted food).
The origin story of Recipe Roundup begins on a cross-country road trip. Somewhere between the Rocky Mountains and the Great Lakes, amid the license plate games and existential questions, my then-not-yet-future-but-now wife inspired me to make a game about healthy food. It’s no coincidence that traveling inspired us to talk about food, as those are two ways we spend much of our free time. Traveling offers amazing opportunities to meet people, experience their traditions, and get a taste of their culture - especially through food!  Having been able to visit so many different countries shows how much people have in common, and also provides a refreshing new perspective on things close to home. You’ve probably eaten banana and pineapple, but have you seen a banana tree forest or pineapple fields? Did you know there are 7,500+ varieties of tomatoes? While we couldn’t fit all of them into this game, I hope that it sparks your curiosity to learn something new about your favorite foods, and maybe find some inspiration for a new recipe to test out.
Tiny Earth Games was founded by Robert Pierce in 2020 to develop games that use science and reason to instill a sense of wonder and purpose in the tiny Earth we call home. Recipe Roundup was developed in partnership with Amanda Barnes, Registered Dietitian Nutritionist (RDN).

<p>Rise to Nobility is a worker (dice) placement game set in The Five Realms, the same fantasy world as Cavern Tavern.

<p><strong>What’s Unique  </strong></p>
<p>The challenging thing is that the total value of dice each player can use during the round is determined by their reputation in the city. Players start with 9 reputation and can increase or decrease their reputation by taking certain actions in the city. With numerous options for spending their dice, players will need to carefully plan their strategy and prioritize their actions.</p>
<p>Each player takes on the role of a landowner with a unique ability. Your goal is to rise from anonymity to the rank of lord. At the end of 10 rounds, the player with the most victory points takes over the head seat at the Stone Council and wins the game.</p>
<p><strong><i>There are many paths for achieving victory.</i></strong></p>
<p><strong>Housing and Employing Settlers </strong></p>
<p>You can focus on increasing the population of the new city of Caveborn by housing the incoming Settlers. If you provide them with a house and spend the goods they require, they will pay you with victory points.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494330704/pzzagq3h3qgugnazod85.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Once the Settlers are housed, you can boost the city's economy by employing your Settlers in the Guilds and by purchasing Workshops for them. Ensuring that you have Apprentices and Guild Masters who are loyal to you will earn you money, resources, and victory points.</p>

<p><strong>Negotiating with the Stone Council</strong></p>
<p>Of course you can choose to play politics and try to deal with the members of the Stone Council to gain victory points. Each race has a representative on the Stone Council.

<p>And don’t forget the High Queen in the White Castle. You can request an audience with her to improve your reputation in the city.  </p>
<p>But your time to achieve your goals is limited, because representatives from all Five Realms are sailing to Caveborn to cast their vote for the new chairman of the Stone Council.  </p>
<p>So, do you have what it takes to become a respectful lord, help Caveborn flourish and prosper, and take your seat at The Stone Council? Are you ready to Rise to Nobility?</p>

<li>We're <strong>keeping it simple</strong> so you can enjoy the game and the time with your friends. With only 2 active Heroes allowed per player, you don't have to remember a thousand things at once.

Alicia, Constantine, Ulrich, Anna and Luther will all gain Bloodshards in the 3rd Combat if you use their abilities well.Some wield battleaxes, others may carry rifles and there are a few who summon up magical powers to counter the swarming hordes of the undead, obliterating the foul creatures with a cool mind and never ending patience. If during the Hunt you don’t want to care about anything but wreaking the most tactical destruction, then select Heroes who gain their Bloodshards at the end of the Hunt, based on the loot they secured. Nimrod, Angelo and Benedictus are your best choices.Beside the undead many other unspeakable creatures roam the wilderness, from huge werebears to tiny white rats. Varden and Shena are your best choices if you want to form alliances with these mythical beasts.The Heroes all gather in Stambul to share their stories of adventures and prepare for their next Hunt. As the rumours go around about the might of our team, and the fortune they make selling the almost priceless Bloodshards they acquired, more and more aspiring Heroes will want to join us. There are, however, two peculiar fellows in the Tavern. One is always surrounded by a crowd, while the other always sits in a dark corner all alone. Although she lacks any kind of martial skills, Natasha, the Seducer, is welcome on any team because of her beauty and her various other talents… While no one would accompany the lone wolf Crow on a Hunt… and he doesn’t want them to either. He is more than capable of completing his quests on his own, staying true to his nickname: the Deathbringer. We're an international team, mostly based in Hungary, Europe. Shardhunters - The Card Game is part of the Unseen Domains dark fantasy universe that we're building in all genres, platforms and basically everywhere possible. We have released an anthology book and a comic book and we're also working on a digital card game.

    As a board game publisher, I was frustrated with the lack of good tools for displaying the games I make at conferences. I decided to design displays that are specifically tailored to meet the needs of the board game industry. Just a few sets of Massif Display stands can make a noticeable difference to your publisher stand at a conference.      Massif Displays are perfect for:

FLGS (Friendly Local Game Store)   ✔
Game Reviewers   ✔
Game Collectors   ✔
Anyone wanting to show off their games   ✔
Book Stores   ✔

We will also be at Internationale Spieltage '17 in Essen, Germany!While many campaigns take an upward of 6 months to fulfill, here are the reasons we anticipate our campaign delivering faster than normal:  
Our product has a very simple design. This means less risk of supply chain issues and manufacturing difficulties. 
Manufacturing is ready to go (see next section). 
We are using an excellent fulfillment company in the same continent as our manufacture. This means we don't have to load the displays onto ships across the Pacific. 
Several of our team members live in Europe and can easily be on hand at our manufacturing and fulfillment companies, should something come up.
       Manufacturing is READY TO GO!We have an excellent manufacturing plant in Netherlands lined up and ready to produce Massif Displays. In fact, they've already made and shipped us several test displays, so that we don't have any unpleasant surprises when we do a full production run.                     The Story Behind Massif Displays      Big statement.

<p>In <strong>Children of the Fall</strong>, the players play as the sole survivors of an apocalypse that has turned all the adults on the planet into evil, bloodthirsty savages known as the fallen. As a group, the players will explore and develop the world and story together in a completely collaborative system. Players will need to keep an eye on the ever shifting hierarchy of their tribe, build and grow their haven and do the jobs that need doing to ensure the tribe’s survival. Agency is shared amongst the players, and the game uses a brand new streamlined and simple rule set, which keeps all the players engaged in every scene.</p>
<p><strong>Children of the Fall</strong> is designed for 3-5 players. It is a GMless story game. Sessions take 120-240 minutes to complete. Unlike many traditional story games, Children of the Fall has support for one shot and campaign styles of play.</p>

<p>By backing the campaign on Indiegogo you will be the first to get your hands on the game (a full month before anyone else). This is also the only place to get the deluxe hardcover version with the unique cover artwork - be a part of history and proudly boast that you are one of the few who can proudly claim ownership of this special edition of the game.</p>
<p>The game is complete - so as soon as the campaign is over you will get your PDF copies with the printed version following shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>The game supplements unlocked as stretch goals will only ever be available here. We will not release these PDF's anywhere else - this is the only chance to get them!</p>

<p><strong>Children of the Fall </strong>comes in a glorious 6x9 hardcover or softcover (as well as a digital edition). The game features a thematic and gritty layout as well as incredible artwork from Vincent Sammy and The Forge Studios.</p>
<p>This campaign is the only place where you will be able to get the limited edition hardcover version of the book with the ""clean"" version of the cover artwork. It is a dramatic and beautiful book which will look great on any bookshelf.</p>
<p>Our previous IGG Campaign not only delivered all rewards and stretch goals on time, but actually early (which is very rare for crowdfunding campaigns). We are confident we can do the same with this campaign!</p>

</div><p>Thank you for all your support! We are extremely proud of <strong>Children of the Fall</strong> and look forward to bringing it to you soon!</p></div>","In Children of the Fall, the players play as the sole survivors of an apocalypse that has turned all the adults on the planet into evil, bloodthirsty savages known as the fallen. As a group, the players will explore and develop the world and story together in a completely collaborative system. Players will need to keep an eye on the ever shifting hierarchy of their tribe, build and grow their haven and do the jobs that need doing to ensure the tribe’s survival. Agency is shared amongst the players, and the game uses a brand new streamlined and simple rule set, which keeps all the players engaged in every scene.
Children of the Fall is designed for 3-5 players. It is a GMless story game. Sessions take 120-240 minutes to complete. Unlike many traditional story games, Children of the Fall has support for one shot and campaign styles of play.



By backing the campaign on Indiegogo you will be the first to get your hands on the game (a full month before anyone else). This is also the only place to get the deluxe hardcover version with the unique cover artwork - be a part of history and proudly boast that you are one of the few who can proudly claim ownership of this special edition of the game.
The game is complete - so as soon as the campaign is over you will get your PDF copies with the printed version following shortly afterwards.
The game supplements unlocked as stretch goals will only ever be available here. We will not release these PDF's anywhere else - this is the only chance to get them!

Children of the Fall comes in a glorious 6x9 hardcover or softcover (as well as a digital edition). The game features a thematic and gritty layout as well as incredible artwork from Vincent Sammy and The Forge Studios.
This campaign is the only place where you will be able to get the limited edition hardcover version of the book with the ""clean"" version of the cover artwork. It is a dramatic and beautiful book which will look great on any bookshelf.
Our previous IGG Campaign not only delivered all rewards and stretch goals on time, but actually early (which is very rare for crowdfunding campaigns). We are confident we can do the same with this campaign!


The game has been lavishly illustrated by acclaimed South African graphic designer and illustrator VINCENT SAMMY. He has created 8 amazing pieces for the game, each of which features in a full page spread in the book. The artwork is visceral, unique and dramatic - just like the game. We are very proud of it.

night I had a dream about a Christmas game to celebrate the birth of Christ.  When I woke up, the basics were laid out fresh in my mind:  the game was a journey where the wise men would follow the guiding star, they would get the three gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh, and there would be obstacles in their journey to overcome.Can you envision your family gathered around the table laughing and playing together focused on the birth of Christ in the spirit of Christmas?  THE GAMEThe game is a challenging journey to see which of the wise men can be the first to reach the baby Jesus in Bethlehem.  There is the excitement of camels to ride and wild stallions to capture, and the dangers of sand storms and robber bands to overcome, and the intrigue of spies with secret codes, and the elation of finally arriving at Bethlehem.  So gather round with family and friends, laugh and play, and bring the spirit of Christ into your Christmas.Stella Nova is three types of games rolled into one for children and adults:        1. a fun racing game,        2. a resource strategy game, and        3. an educational trivia game.  1. The basic game is a Contest to see which of the wise men can be the first to reach the baby Jesus in Bethlehem.  Even young children can play.  The magi traverse the caravan trails on the game board, which is a huge 20""x 30"" map of the Middle East with authentic names from that ancient time period.  But before arriving at Bethlehem, the magi must collect the three gifts of:gold, frankincense and myrrh.  Also they will need provisions and supplies for the long journey: 
stores of food and water to cross the deserts,
tents to protect against the sand storms,
compasses to guide them when the clouds obscure the guiding star,
weapons to fight off the bands of robbers, and
secret codes to get by the spies of King Herod.
 2. For youth and adults, Stella Nova is also a Strategy Game that tests their wits. The equipment can only be obtained at certain city bazaars along the caravan trails.  So players must:
determine the most efficient caravan trail from the East to Jerusalem-- remember you have to pick up the three gifts;
decide how many days supply you need between cities-- you can only go so far without food and water; and
decide what resources and equipment to take and what to leave behind-- the camels can only carry so much.
3. And in addition, Stella Nova is a Bible Trivia Game.  To obtain the three gifts and the needed equipment, adult players must answer questions.  The question cards are divided into two groups:
History and Geography, and 
Biblical Scripture.
An answer sheet is provided to check the responses.  In addition the Bible question cards have citations of chapter and verse. TESTIMONIALS""This game brings the Christmas story of the wise men to life.  I played it with my nieces and nephews; even the young kids really got into it!  They loved figuring out their own strategy to get to Bethlehem."" - Lea, Fairfax, Virginia""I love this game, we all had fun.

For example, Yathrib in Arabia is called Medina today. The town was renamed by the Muslim prophet Muhammad in 622 AD. The ancient gold mines were located in Kush. In the Middle Ages this region was called Nubia, but today it is called Sudan.  The two great centers of learning, Alexandria and Antioch, are also on the map. They along with Rome comprised the three largest cities in the Roman Empire. In science, the term “stella nova” was first used by the great astronomer Tycho Brahe.  In his book “De Nova Stella” of 1573, he disproved the Aristotelian belief in an unchanging heaven. His measurements showed that new stars, “stellae novae,” lacked the expected parallax. Today in modern astronomy, a “stella nova” is called a “super nova.” Answers to Biblical questions have citations by chapter and verse. The answers have been checked and conform with the King James version (KJV), the New Living Translation (NLT), the New Revised Standard version (NRSV), and the New American Bible (NAB). THE REWARDSThere will be games coming available for Indiegogo backers by Thanksgiving.  So we can promise that the first 1,000 games will be delivered to our backers by Christmas.$39  ""The Child"" - One Stella Nova game with Free Shipping in the US$72  ""The Loving Couple"" - Two Stella Nova games with Free Shipping in the US$99  ""The Three Wise Men"" - Three Stella Nova games to you wise men and women with Free Shipping in the US, Plus three ""gold seal winner"" stickers to attach to the games$159  ""The Star"" - Five Stella Nova games to you Stars with Free Shipping in the US, Plus five ""gold seal winner"" stickers to attach to the games$299  ""The Shepherds""  - Ten Stella Nova games to you Shepherds and Pastors with Free Shipping in the US, Plus 10 ""gold seal winner"" stickers to attach to the games, Plus a Free DVD of the acclaimed movie ""The Nativity Story"" $650  ""The Host of Angels"" - 10 autographed Stella Nova games to you Angels with Free Shipping in the US, Plus 10 matching Stella Novas, Plus ""gold seal winner"" stickers to attach to the games, Plus a free DVD of the acclaimed movie ""The Nativity Story,"" Plus dinner with the game creator in 2019 (if you are within a 2-hour drive, otherwise a gift certificate to a restaurant.) STRETCH REWARDS$15,000 -  Every Indiegogo backer will receive a ""gold seal winner"" sticker that can be placed on the game box.$25,000 -  Every Indiegogo backer will receive an exclusive ""premier"" sticker that can be placed on the game board, proving that you are an original Stella Nova backer.  And the Star, Shepherd and Angel backers will be acknowledged by name on the Stella Nova website. THE CREATORS Hello, I'm Dallen Haven, the younger part of a father and son team.  Christian created the basic design of the Stella Nova game.  Then I formulated the rules, and improved them based on the recommendations of the play-testers.  We're very grateful to all of them for the many hours they spent.   Christian then worked with the outside contractors to make the vision a reality.  Pictured below is the original ""game board"" sent to the first play-testers.We are so pleased to have our hand-drawn sketches converted into works of beauty by the artistic talent of our illustrator and graphics designer, Michael Spahitz, of BoardGameDesigns.com in Nevada.And we are grateful for the production expertise of our manufacturer, EPI DeLano Services of Michigan.  They are one of only three companies in all of America that could produce the game for us.  THE FUNDINGThe funds of $5,000 will be used for production, and for publicity, promotion and marketing, so that more people like you can celebrate the birth of Christ in a fun and joyous way at Christmas.  We plan to expend the funds for Internet advertising with Google, Facebook and Amazon., We hope to reach the second stretch goal, so we have funds for more games and greater exposure by advertising with Christian and Catholic periodicals and talk radio.  If we reach the third stretch goal, we plan to produce more games and market them at the Christian Products show in Atlanta and the Catholic Marketing show in Chicago.  THE RISKSThere are risks in every business venture; we have experienced marketing risks with slow growth from using word of mouth.  Now with your campaign pledges we hope to realize the vision of providing a fun way for many families and friends to celebrate the birth of Jesus at Christmastime.In our case, you will not face the design and production risks in receiving your perks.  Stella Nova is already designed and the games will be available for you the backers before the campaign is over.  However, you still face the acceptance risks of a game that may not achieve the anticipated wide-spread acclaim.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Q:You call the smaller table a 3'x5' (play surface) but it is actually slightly larger. Why is that?</p>
<p>During the design process we have been looking at the production, engineering and sustainability (waste) of the Table of Ultimate Gaming. In a nutshell, in order to maximize all aspects of the tables production and usability, while minimizing waste, the smaller table (in all heights) is now about 5 inches wider and 1 inch shorter. This will come as good news to those who wanted a little more room in your tables. The smaller standard table now has a net gain of 259 sq inches. </p>

Q:You call the smaller table a 3'x5' (play surface) but it is actually slightly larger. Why is that?
During the design process we have been looking at the production, engineering and sustainability (waste) of the Table of Ultimate Gaming. In a nutshell, in order to maximize all aspects of the tables production and usability, while minimizing waste, the smaller table (in all heights) is now about 5 inches wider and 1 inch shorter. This will come as good news to those who wanted a little more room in your tables. The smaller standard table now has a net gain of 259 sq inches. 
 
 
 
Many accessories are available in the Pledge bundles or as add-ons including these cup/mug holder - dice tray combo units.

We had two tables at GenCon and they were fantastic, rock solid and looked brand new after 4 days of hundreds of game demos and thousands of people playing, leaning, sitting and working on this. When we say they are rock solid, they are ROCK SOLID!

 Here are three 3'x5' tables joined end to end to create a 3'x15' table. Three 4'x6' tables joined end to end would create a 4'x18' table.

 Assembly is straight-forward and very easy. Only one tool is needed, a hex wrench, and we included it of course! One or two people will take 30 minutes to assemble. All tables ship in very well protected packaging.

 

 One of the most exciting aspects of the Table of Ultimate Gaming is the optional modular decoration that attached and removed in second yet remains very secure to the table. Four themes are currently available with more coming in the future! Choose from Castles, Dragons, Celtic Knots, and Skulls in decorations that match your table color perfectly! If you are not looking for special decoration, know that your basic table ships with traditional wood panels that match your tables color.
