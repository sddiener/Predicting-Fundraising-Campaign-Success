<p><span>""Be a New Orleanian Wherever You Are,"" reads my favorite T-shirt. Given to me by a fellow Cajun visiting San Antonio after Hurricane Katrina, the little piece of home could not have proven more precious in the months and years to come. Every time I put it on, it reminds me of the city that raised me, the people who love me, and the food that I cannot wait to share with the rest of the world.</span></p>
<p>Shrimpfest is the first step in my ability to bring authentic Cajun cooking to Texas, a place that sometimes feels oddly far from the city I call home. Randall and I have been accepted with open arms as food vendors at this seaside event, and if we are able to raise the money here to purchase the food we need to make it happen, we will be the first Cajun booth to show a presence here. The event coordinator, Kristine, is genuinely excited at the prospect of our attendance and contribution to the festival. It is the first event at which I will showcase my true Cajun roots through the passion I have found for cooking as a means of telling a story. Unmistakeabaly authentic red beans and rice, scrumptious seafood gumbo, playful shrimp-stuffed andouille corndogs, and sinfully sweet beignets will all grace the menu at this event. Not only will it be a chance for me to express my Cajun creativity to the public, but it will also be the first of many steps in raising the capital we will need to open our very own restaurant in San Antonio. Le Rêve, as we have thought of naming it, truly would be a dream, an opportunity to bring elevated Cajun cuisine to a city that longs for it, a city full of other displaced New Orleanians just like myself (Kickstarter project #2 to come soon)!</p>
<p><span>We already know we can make some serious cash to put towards our restaurant dreams. At an event with over 4,000 in attendance last year, we will be the only vendors offering Cajun cuisine. Alongside the endless booths selling shrimp kabobs and fried shrimp baskets will be a couple with a real passion for food that excites and goes beyond the norm in every possible way, food that is carefully crafted by people who really know flavor! Based on statistics from last year's shrimp fest, we are expecting to serve at least 100-150 meals each day of the 2 day event. We are planning to price each of our menu items at an easy $5, putting our sales projections at around $1500 for the weekend. With our food costs only around $500, that is a serious profit! Check out the Shrimpfest page from 2012 here:<a href=""http://www.seadriftchamber.com/site/2012-shrimpfest/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.seadriftchamber.com/site/2012-shrimpfest/</a>.</span></p>
<p><span>Our Cajun fare will fit right into the feel of the event, alongside fishing tournaments for the young and the old, outdoor sporting events like volleyball and horseshoes, and the ever popular summer beauty pageants. There will be plenty of fun to be had in the sun for all in attendance, and we are looking for the opportunity to be one of the lucky food vendors gracing the event and just making people happy. Happiness is a warm gumbo, and that is what we are trying to bring to  Shrimpfest 2013.</span></p>
<p><span>We cannot wait to share our food and our joy with the people of Seadrift and, hopefully, in turn, the lovely people of San Antonio and beyond. We would love to share our unique journey with you and pledge to share all we can about the road we take to get there. Regular project updates will be made here, and we hope that you enjoy all of the rewards in store! Please join us on our culinary journey by aiding in our ability to purchase the product we need to feed all these hungry folks! And if you're in the neighborhood, by all means, come check us out!

<p>The VooDoo Zip Line is Vegas' newest thrill ride being erected on the rooftop of the Rio All-Suite Hotel &amp; Casino.</p>
<p>Two years ago our company had a dream to create one of the most unique amusement attractions in the world. The VooDoo Zip Line attraction is a 490+ foot tall, 1500+ foot long, zip line experience that flies over unparalleled views of the Las Vegas strip. </p>
<h2> </h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/82353/files/20130918131255-zipview.jpg?1379535175"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h2>About The Zip Line</h2>
<p>Created by New Capital Ventures<span>, the VooDoo Zip Line will connect the two towers of the Rio Las Vegas. The thrill ride will begin </span>on the patio of the VooDoo Rooftop, located on the 50th floor of the Masquerade Tower, and will hurl riders at speeds of up to 33 miles per hour to the adjoining 20-story Ipanema Tower. Guests will make a return trip back to the starting point traveling backwards. The feet-dangling, adrenaline rush will fling two riders at once, more than 490 feet above the ground. Offering one of the best views of the city, the VooDoo Zip Line will boast a 360-degree panorama of the famed Las Vegas Strip and scenic views of the surrounding mountain ranges. The heart-pumping adventure will cover one-third of a mile in one minute and 10 seconds.<br/> </p>

Two years ago our company had a dream to create one of the most unique amusement attractions in the world. The VooDoo Zip Line attraction is a 490+ foot tall, 1500+ foot long, zip line experience that flies over unparalleled views of the Las Vegas strip. 
 

About The Zip Line
Created by New Capital Ventures, the VooDoo Zip Line will connect the two towers of the Rio Las Vegas. The thrill ride will begin on the patio of the VooDoo Rooftop, located on the 50th floor of the Masquerade Tower, and will hurl riders at speeds of up to 33 miles per hour to the adjoining 20-story Ipanema Tower. Guests will make a return trip back to the starting point traveling backwards. The feet-dangling, adrenaline rush will fling two riders at once, more than 490 feet above the ground. Offering one of the best views of the city, the VooDoo Zip Line will boast a 360-degree panorama of the famed Las Vegas Strip and scenic views of the surrounding mountain ranges. The heart-pumping adventure will cover one-third of a mile in one minute and 10 seconds.

There are a ton of cool projects on the site, and being able to be a part of that melting pot made it a no-brainier for us to launch our initial campaign on indiegogo.com

<h3>FAQs</h3>
<b><div><b><br/></b></div>Le Voltî est-il légal ?</b> </div><div>Oui, comme n’importe quel monnaie, bon d’achat, chèque-repas ou éco-chèque.
Mais le Voltî est seulement valable dans un réseau local clairement identifié, c’est-à-dire
auprès des commerçants adhérents au projet sur les entités de Ciney, Hamois, Havelange, Marche en-Famenne,
Nassogne, Somme-Leuze et Rochefort ainsi que dans la périphérie directe de cette
zone. </div><div><b>Est-ce que le Voltî va remplacer l’euro ? </b></div><div>Non, l’euro continuera à circuler dans la région considérée.
Mais chez les prestataires membres du réseau, vous pourrez payer en Voltî à la place des euros. </div><div><b>Quelles différences avec l’euro ? </b></div><div>Il y a plusieurs différences importantes:</div><div>
<ul>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Premièrement, le Voltî est confiné à une zone locale et à un réseau identifié de prestataires. </span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Deuxièmement, c’est un système d'échange plus éthique parce que les prestataires
s’engagent dans une démarche écologique, relocalisante, humaine et citoyenne. </span></li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Troisièmement, c’est un système d'échange sans intérêt : personne n’aura intérêt à
conserver des Voltî pour spéculer, mais au contraire, tout le monde aura intérêt à les faire
circuler.</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<div>
<b>Pourquoi utiliser un bout de papier qui a la même valeur que l'euro plutôt que
l'euro lui-même ?</b> </div>
<div>Le Voltî n’a de valeur que localement. En restant nécessairement dans la région, il
augmente sa richesse, alors que l’euro est conçu pour le grand marché, l’import-export, la
spéculation sur les matières premières, etc. C’est avec nos épargnes en euros que nous finançons
les délocalisations de nos industries et nos emplois. Plus de 85 % de la masse monétaire nourrit
l’économie spéculative au détriment de l'économie réelle. Les commerçants qui reçoivent des Voltî chercheront à s'approvisionner et à s'achalander dans la région plutôt que sur les marchés internationaux.</div>
<div><b>Comment le Voltî fait-il pour relocaliser ? </b></div>
<div>Pour les particuliers, le Voltî peut servir à relocaliser leurs échanges (préférer acheter local plutôt que de recourir aux zones commerciales et aux multinationales).<br/>Pour les prestataires, le Voltî peut les inciter à relocaliser leur approvisionnement ; ils y ont même un intérêt direct : éviter le prélèvement (commission ou rédimage) lors de la reconversion vers l’euro. A titre dérogatoire, durant les premières années, le prélèvement sera nul sur les reconversions, pour instaurer la confiance – la mise en place de ce prélèvement sera décidé par l'assemblée générale).<i></i>

<b>Est-ce qu’il existe déjà des monnaies locales complémentaires ? </b>
</div>

Sud… et même en Suisse.<br/>
</div>
</div><div><b>Est-ce que j’utilise déjà une monnaie complémentaire sans en avoir conscience ? </b></div><div>Oui !! Les chèques-repas, les miles des compagnies aériennes ou les points offerts sur les cartes de
fidélité des grandes surfaces s’assimilent à cette pratique…
Mais ces monnaies ne sont pas locales, elles sont seulement utilisables dans certains commerces
ou compagnies aériennes. </div><div>
<b>Est-ce que le Voltî est juste une carte de fidélité ?</b> </div><div>Non, parce qu’avec vos Voltî, vous pourrez non seulement payer les commerçants mais aussi régler
votre cotisation à une association locale, payer votre kiné, etc., pour autant que ces personnes
adhèrent au projet.
Et, s’ils le désirent, certains – pas tous – commerçants-prestataires pourront ajouter un « geste
commercial » sous forme de ristourne… ou de Voltî, à l'instar des cartes de fidélité. </div><div>
<b>Est-ce qu’on peut acheter n’importe où et n’importe quoi avec le Voltî ? </b>
</div><div>Non, seulement chez les commerçants-prestataires qui adhéreront à l’association et à sa charte de

Une monnaie locale complémentaire (MLC) est un bon de soutien à l'économie locale, auquel on accorde la même valeur que l'Euro. Ce bon peut être utilisé dans une zone géographique définie par toutes les personnes, services, commerces, associations,... qui ont marqué leur accord.

Il y en a 13 000 dans le monde, désormais 5 en Belgique, et une soixantaine en France : FUTURE (ARTE) vous les fait découvrir. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpE8UMMZa9w

C’est un outil de relocalisation de l'économie en favorisant la consommation locale et les circuits courts. Il vise au maintien et à la dynamisation de l'emploi local. Il cherche à renforcer les interactions entre citoyens et commerçants/producteurs d’une même région, et qui permet de conserver les ""plus values"" du territoire plutôt que les céder aux multinationales situées à Londres, New-York ou Hong-Kong.L’objectif est de rendre à la monnaie son rôle principal : être un moyen d’échange qui circule, qui ne permet pas aux riches de s'enrichir plus, ni de spéculer. C’est une démarche citoyenne de réappropriation de la monnaie.
Elle contribue également à la diminution de la dépendance énergétique en réduisant le nombre de trajets et les kilomètres que parcourent les biens que l'on consomme.ConcrètementLe nom de notre bon d’échange/monnaie locale est le Voltî (volontiers en wallon).Il couvrira les communes de Ciney, Hamois, Havelange, Marche-en-Famenne, Nassogne, Rochefort et Somme-Leuze et leurs périphéries.Les initiateurs de ce projet innovant et prometteur sont des citoyens de votre région, soucieux de relocaliser l’économie. Ils sont réunis dans le groupe «Monnaie locale – Le Voltî» développé au départ du petit théâtre de la Grande Vie de Forzée et soutenu par le Réseau Financité. 

Après une phase de maturation de près de deux ans, nous - initiateurs du projet - avons accéléré le pas à l'automne 2015 pour mobiliser les forces et co-construire le projet avec toutes les parties prenantes. Nous voilà aujourd'hui prêts à lancer le Voltî, enthousiastes à l'idée de faire notre part. Nous serons accompagnés de nombreux citoyens, professionnels et associations.


Des réunions publiques ont eu lieu dans différentes communes et ont connu un beau succès voire de l'enthousiasme de la part des personnes présentes ce qui nous a conforté dans le développement de notre projet. 


Le Voltî favorisera les commerçants engagés dans une démarche de progrès vers des pratiques durables et responsables et s'adresse à tous les citoyens soucieux de se réapproprier la monnaie remettant en cause leur mode de consommation. Le Voltî crée ainsi un cercle vertueux et développe l'économie de proximité. 


Dans un deuxième temps, les euros convertis en Voltî seront déposés sur des comptes épargne auprès de nos partenaires inscrits dans la finance éthique et solidaire. Nous luttons ainsi à notre échelle contre la spéculation (les banques traditionnelles n'ont pas cette masse monétaire à disposition) et une partie des dépôts pourra faire l'objet de micro-crédits dédicacés aux producteurs ou commerçants de la région via un organisme accrédité, moyennant une garantie sur le capital de la part de l'organisme prêteur.




Pourquoi une collecte de fonds?

Nous désirons mettre le Voltî en circulation à l'automne 2016, et pour cela nous devons mettre en œuvre l'impression des coupons-billets, dont le design a été assuré par des artistes locaux et la sécurité sera garantie par différents mécanismes de protection du billet (hologramme, encres non photocopiables, numéro de série,...)
Cette impression sécurisée est coûteuse et nous souhaitons faire appel aux citoyens pour les impliquer dans un projet qui bénéficiera à toute notre région, tout en préservant notre indépendance.

http://peche-monnaie-locale.fr/billets/Afin de connaître l'aspect qu'aura le Voltî chez nous, nous vous invitons à aller voir un prototype du billet dans la Galerie de photos.


Nous avons besoin de rassembler 5252€ afin de financer l'impression des premiers billets.

3500€ pour l'impression et la sécurisation des 12 500 premiers billets
550€ pour la communication (flyers, autocollants, dossiers commerçants,...)

737€ de belles contreparties aux dons que vous nous ferez généreusement


Si nous dépassons le montant de la collecte, nous utiliserons vos dons pour imprimer davantage de billets. Nous estimons que l'impression de 30 à 40.000 Voltî seront nécessaires pour les premières années de fonctionnement.

Pour les professionnels, nous délivrons (sur demande) une facture pour les montants à partir de 50€, pour frais publicitaires.

vous pouvez payer en Voltî un de vos fournisseurs s’il les accepte (s’il ne les accepte pas,
c’est l’occasion de lui proposer de se joindre au mouvement). 
vous pouvez, au lieu de rendre de la monnaie en euros, la rendre en Voltî à vos clients (moyennant leur accord, bien entendu).

Bien entendu, en tant que particulier utilisateur de Voltî, vous pourriez aussi les dépenser chez un
autre prestataire du réseau.
en dernier recours, vous pouvez reconvertir vos Voltî en euros.

Puis-je reconvertir mes Voltî en euros ? 
Les utilisateurs particuliers doivent dépenser leurs Voltî chez un prestataire.Seuls les prestataires de biens et services adhérents à l'asbl et figurant à l’annuaire du Voltî ont la possibilité de reconvertir les Voltî détenus en euros avec application d'une commission de change.Les prestataires de biens et services qui acceptent d'être comptoirs de change seront exonérés de la dite commission de change.

Que deviennent les euros que j’échange contre des Voltî ?

Est-ce que le Voltî va augmenter mon pouvoir d’achat ? 
Pour les utilisateurs particuliers, oui si certains prestataires accordent des réductions du fait de la

Pour les prestataires, également : 


en recrutant de nouveaux clients particuliers qui choisiraient de se fournir localement en

en étant sollicités par d'autres prestataires de biens ou services qui choisiraient de se
fournir localement plutôt que via leurs filières traditionnelles et plus éloignées, pour
pouvoir écouler les Voltî dépensés chez eux.

Quel est l’intérêt pour un prestataire d’accepter le Voltî ? 


Parce que le Voltî va fonctionner comme un « label éthique », un signe de reconnaissance ;

Il est également toujours intéressant, pour un prestataire, de faire partie d’un réseau, local

Qui va gérer le Voltî ? 


Une asbl gérera le projet du Voltî. Elle sera constituée de citoyens consommateurs (les
utilisateurs) et de commerçants ou d’acteurs sociaux et culturels ou de pouvoirs publics (les
prestataires). 

L’assemblée générale et le conseil d'administration seront composés de représentants de
chacune de ces catégories d'acteurs.



Comment devenir utilisateur du Voltî ? 


Soit en adhérant à l’association (le montant de la cotisation est libre à partir d'1€) ou en
convertissant des euros en Voltî dans un comptoir de change de
votre commune. 
Soit en acceptant qu’un prestataire vous rende votre monnaie en Voltî : il ne vous restera
plus qu’à lire l’annuaire des prestataires disponible sur internet et aller y dépenser vos
Voltî! 

L'asbl étant en autofinancement et non subsidiée, toute contribution volontaire
supplémentaire est la bienvenue pour permettre le bon fonctionnement de l'asbl.



Comment fait-on pour se procurer des Voltî ? 
En se rendant chez un prestataire qui a accepté de devenir comptoir de change. L'information se trouve dans le catalogue du Voltî. 
En quoi l'utilisation du Voltî est-elle une démarche citoyenne ? 


Parce que vous retrouvez une certaine maîtrise dans l’usage de la monnaie, en participant à
une association qui s’est réappropriée le mécanisme monétaire. 
En utilisant une monnaie d’initiative citoyenne, vous participez à un mouvement qui crée
une confiance nouvelle entre les acteurs d’un territoire. 

Parce que le Voltî s’intègre dans un mouvement de convergence avec d’autres démarches
citoyennes existantes, comme Rochefort en transition, Ciney en Transition, Colibri-Famenne
et leurs marchés fermiers, les GACs de la région,…

<h4>DriWater is the preferred method for watering plants and trees.  Saves water, time and money.                                       </h4>
<h4> </h4>
<h3>What is DriWater?</h3>
<p>DriWater is a 100% natural gel made from 98% pure water and 2% food grade ingredients. DriWater is NOT an absorbent polymer.  DriWater's unique gel gradually breaks down when in contact with the natural microorganisms found in soil.  As the gel slowly converts back to liquid, it moves down through the root zone of the plant, delivering moisture at a consistent rate.  No more cycles of being too wet or too dry.  DriWater time release water can water a plant for up to 90 days with less water than ever before.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/161871/files/20131029113606-Kickstarterpto.gif?1383071766"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h4>Production</h4>
<p>DriWater is produced in Santa Rosa, California.  We purchase all our materials used in the manufacturing process in the United States, creating jobs all around the country.  DriWater has a shelf life of 18 months.  </p>
<h4>                        We are proudly made in the U.S.A.</h4>
<p><b>DriWater has a complete line of products for all your indoor and outdoor watering needs.</b></p>
<p> </p>

<h4>The DriWater Mission</h4>
<p>The planet earth has no more water today than it did millions of years ago and only two percent of it is fresh water. Human demand of fresh water is increasing in step with population growth.</p>
<p>The growing shortage of fresh water poses the biggest obstacle to protecting the environment and producing enough food for the burgeoning world population.</p>
<p>Our global mission is to provide solutions to these environmental and human challenges by:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Providing high quality water conserving products for worldwide irrigation applications.</p></li>
<li>Passionately working to change the way the world uses water through education, example and extraordinary effort.</li>
<li>Responsibly balancing the financial and human needs of our employees, customers and suppliers.</li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<h4>How do Homeowners use DriWater?  </h4>
<p><b>People who grow houseplants represent the largest segment of the gardening community.  The biggest challenge-providing their plants with the proper amount of water on a consistent basis.  More plants die from over-or-under watering than any other cause.  DriWater time release water takes the guesswork out of watering.  </b></p>
<p><b>Vacations </b>-You are finally ready for that well deserved vacation, you've saved up, packed and re-packed and planned everything down to the last detail.  Even though you hate to do it, we all do, you took the long walk to the neighbors house to ask the dreaded question, <b>""Will you water my plants while I'm gone?""</b></p>
<p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/161892/files/20131029114743-Kickstarter_vaca.gif?1383072463"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Houseplants</strong> DriWater can be used year round for your indoor watering needs.   Remember that plant in the guest room that always looks half dead?  DriWater to the rescue.  No need to write a note to help remember to water.  Ficus trees as well as other finicky plant love the consistent moisture that DriWater delivers.  DriWater eliminates the need to drag the ladder out every week to water plants that are too high up to reach. </p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""326"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/W90u-QnylqQ?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Hanging Flower Baskets &amp; Pots </b>We plant beautiful flowers and water every day, spilling water all over and creating a mess.  Unfortunately we miss a day or two and we end up with dry stringy half dead flowers. The only way to fix the situation is to toss everything out and start over.  Next time you plant your hanging baskets or porch pots, add DriWater and cut your watering down to once or twice a week.  DriWater will keep moisture available to the water hungry flowers and hydrate them between waterings. DriWater acts as a supplement for Annual Flowers and Vegetables. Helps keep Grandma off that dangerous ladder too.</p>
<p><b>Vacation Homes </b>Many of our customers have a vacation cabin or second home.  They find it difficult to add plants to an existing landscape with the limited time they are at the property.  When planting those new trees and shrubs, just add DriWater and the watering is taken care of, allowing new plantings to thrive while you are away.  Our newest product has added nutrients, insuring your plants get the healthy start they need to establish strong root systems.</p>
<p><b>Vegetable Gardens </b>In our quest to live healthier lives, we have become more aware of what we put into our bodies.  Sales of organic foods have soared in the last 10 years.  More people are growing their own vegetables and enjoying the backyard harvest.  Using DriWater in your vegetable garden will give you more than significant water conservation. This year we watered our vegetable garden only 4 times throughout the entire growing season, saving thousand of gallons of water. Our garden provides over 3,000 pounds of vegetables that we donate to our local food mission.  Watering below the top of the soil has other benefits as well.  Less surface moisture means, less pests and less weeds, saving you hours of time and that sore back.</p>
<p><b>Trees &amp; Shrubs  </b>It's never been easier to give new plantings a healthy start.  Using DriWater insures that newly planted trees and shrubs will have water available during the critical first few months.  Studies show that plants watered properly develop healthier root systems, allowing for better growth.  DriWater is like insurance for your plants.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>Do you think DriWater is only used during the summer months?</h4>
<p>DriWater opened a new market years ago with Christmas Poinsettia watering.  We found that churches and homeowners alike had a real need for help.  Churches use volunteers to water and that wasn't working out too well for them.  They had problems with over-watering, under-watering and water ruining their beautiful old hardwood floors.  Homeowners are so busy during the holiday season and adding those few extra plants just became too much.  The Poinsettia's would dry out and no matter how much they watered after that, the plants would never recover.  The solution was to apply 2 DriWater Gel Pac's on top of the soil when they first purchased the Poinsettia's.  With DriWater's slow release, the plants only need to be watered once from Thanksgiving through the end of December.</p>

<h4>The perfect holiday gift or stocking stuffer  </h4>
<p>We all have one or two people in our lives who have absolutely everything and we cringe at the thought of trying to find a gift that they would actually use.  You know the ones, they live to work and when they vacation, they are off to exotic destinations.  They have said it a hundred times, if only I had the time, I would love to have live plants.  But with the long hours and constant work traveling, it's something I realized I had to give up. Wouldn't it be great to hand over a beautiful Poinsettia to them and say, ""Don't water this, DriWater is on the job""  Give the Gift of Convenience this year.  DriWater will give them the beautiful plants they crave and no more black thumb comments.  Gifts can be ordered anytime and sent directly to your loved ones in time for the Holiday Poinsettia season.</p>

<h4> Why Plant Trees?</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Trees are invaluable life resources.  They give oxygen to people, animals and the planet, sustaining life on earth.</b></li>
<li><b>Trees help recharge ground water and sustain stream flow.</b></li>
<li><b>Suburban streets and parking lots cool off when trees shade them, reducing temperatures.</b></li>
<li><b>Trees instill community appreciation, add beauty and grace to any community setting, calming people's nerves and may even reduce crime.</b></li>
<li><b>In 50 years, one tree generates approximately $30,000 worth of oxygen, recycles $35,000 worth of water and removes $60,000 of air pollution.</b></li>
<li><b>Trees prevent or reduce soil erosion.</b></li>
<li><b>Trees planted along rivers, streams and lakes reduce water temperature and prevent or reduce bank erosion and silt.  Their root also provide hiding places for fish.</b></li>
<li><b>Trees add brilliant colors to fall landscapes.</b></li>
<li><b>Research shows that trees help reduce stress in the workplace and speed hospital patients' recovery.</b></li>
</ul>
<h3>Commerical users of DriWater</h3>
<p>DriWater is beneficial for many commercial applications.  It has started to become the ""go to"" method for irrigation in areas where water is not accessible.  As the world experiences long droughts, water that was used inefficiently in the pastis no longer the norm.  Agencies are looking for ways to conserve the water we have while continuing to plant trees and shrubs.  <b>This delicate balance required something new and inventive...DriWater</b></p>

<h3>Frequently Asked Questions </h3>
<p> </p>
<h4>What is DRiWATER®and how does it work?</h4>
<p>DRiWATER<sup>®</sup>consists of 98% water and 2% food grade ingredients.<span>  DRiWATER</span><sup>®</sup>is 100% natural and harmless to people and animals.<span>  It is </span>not a polyacrylamide polymer!<span>  DRiWATER</span><sup>®</sup>begins to liquefy when it comes in direct contact with soil.<span>The enzymes naturally found in soil gradually break down the food grade ingredients and  convert DRiWATER</span><sup>® </sup>back into liquid water.<span>  The capillary activity in the soil then carries and maintains the  moisture throughout the root zone for up to 90 days. </span></p>
<h4>
<br/>Is it possible to over-water using DRiWATER®?</h4>
<p>When applied per manufacturers recommended usage, DRiWATER will not over-water plants.<span>  Each 90 -Day Quart carton or Tube and Gel Pac will deliver one ounce of water every three days.  When used to establish native plants outdoors, DRiWATER</span><sup>®</sup>is designed to deliver only enough moisture to keep the plant under an<span>  adequate amount of stress, which causes the plant to seek its own moisture source to sustain itself.  When used as supplemental irrigation to aid in ornamental plant establishment in an existing irrigated area, DRiWATER</span><sup>®</sup>is designed to deliver enough water to keep the root mass moist between normal irrigation cycles.<span>  If it rains, the enzymes activity is reduced and DRiWATER</span><sup>®</sup>almost stops providing moisture.<span>  </span></p>
<h4>
<br/>Does DRiWATER®freeze?</h4>
<p>DRiWATER<sup>®</sup>freezes when temperatures fall below 25 degrees Fahrenheit and will not be affected when it thaws out.<span>  Bacteria in the soil become dormant at approximately 38 degrees and, at this point, DRiWATER</span><sup>®</sup>stops<span>  liquefying.  When temperatures rise, the enzymes become active and the DRiWATER</span><sup>®</sup>begins to liquefy again.</p>
<p> </p>
<h4>When temperatures increase will DRiWATER® liquefy at a faster rate? </h4>
<p>A little.<span>  DRiWATER</span><sup>®</sup>is activated by microbial enzyme activity in the soil; it is not heat-activated like a common polymer.<span>  In high temperatures, the enzymes in the soil continue to break DRiWATER</span><sup>®</sup>down at a consistent and steady release rate.<span>  If the plant requires more moisture, additional DRiWATER</span><sup>®</sup>or supplemental irrigation should be used.</p>
<h4>
<br/>How can one Quart of DRiWATER®give a plant enough moisture when the<span>  evapo-transpiration (ET) rate of the plant is greater than the liquefaction rate of  DRiWATER</span>®?</h4>
<p>In the first year of establishing an indigenous tree or shrub, developing a root system to sustain the plant is the main goal.<span>  If a newly planted tree or shrub is given scheduled watering during its first year, it may encourage the plant to push growth (creating greater ET rates) that it is not yet able to support by the plants root mass.  When a plant is grown in the ground from seed, the root develops in proportion to support plant growth.  When plant materials are grown in containers and transplanted into the ground, it is important to encourage the roots to grow out and develop so they can draw enough moisture and nutrients from the soil to be self-supportive.  During the plants’ early establishment period, most of the moisture the plant is given will remain below the ground within the root mass and ET rates are lower than normal at this time.  Larger plants will require  additional units and high temperatures may require supplemental watering.  </span></p>
<h4>Are there nutrients added to DRiWATER®?</h4>
<p>Yes, DRiWATER<sup>®</sup> Plus and DRiWATER Thrive contain Zinc and Acetic acid to reduce transplant shock and enhance root development. Tests have shown an increase of up to 190% in root growth in 30 days with DRiWATER Plus. DRiWATER Thrive is targeted to maintain plants over time, providing continuous root stimulation. The original DRiWATER<sup>®</sup> formula of pure potable water and binder is also still available.</p>
<h4>Can I fertilize while using DRiWATER®?</h4>
<p>Yes, however, during the first year, when establishing indigenous plant materials, fertilizing with a high nitrogen-based fertilizer is generally not recommended.<span>  When DRiWATER</span><sup>®</sup> comes in direct contact with<span>  fertilizers, it will cause it to liquefy at a faster rate.  For this reason, when using fertilizers, it is important to check the DRiWATER</span><sup>®</sup> after 45 days.<span>  </span></p>
<span><h4>After DRiWATER® has finished liquefying what should be done with the Quart or the Tube?</h4>

What is DriWater?
DriWater is a 100% natural gel made from 98% pure water and 2% food grade ingredients. DriWater is NOT an absorbent polymer.  DriWater's unique gel gradually breaks down when in contact with the natural microorganisms found in soil.  As the gel slowly converts back to liquid, it moves down through the root zone of the plant, delivering moisture at a consistent rate.  No more cycles of being too wet or too dry.  DriWater time release water can water a plant for up to 90 days with less water than ever before.

Production
DriWater is produced in Santa Rosa, California.  We purchase all our materials used in the manufacturing process in the United States, creating jobs all around the country.  DriWater has a shelf life of 18 months.  
                        We are proudly made in the U.S.A.
DriWater has a complete line of products for all your indoor and outdoor watering needs.
 

 
The DriWater Mission
The planet earth has no more water today than it did millions of years ago and only two percent of it is fresh water. Human demand of fresh water is increasing in step with population growth.
The growing shortage of fresh water poses the biggest obstacle to protecting the environment and producing enough food for the burgeoning world population.
Our global mission is to provide solutions to these environmental and human challenges by:

Providing high quality water conserving products for worldwide irrigation applications.
Passionately working to change the way the world uses water through education, example and extraordinary effort.
Responsibly balancing the financial and human needs of our employees, customers and suppliers.


 
How do Homeowners use DriWater?  
People who grow houseplants represent the largest segment of the gardening community.  The biggest challenge-providing their plants with the proper amount of water on a consistent basis.  More plants die from over-or-under watering than any other cause.  DriWater time release water takes the guesswork out of watering.  
Vacations -You are finally ready for that well deserved vacation, you've saved up, packed and re-packed and planned everything down to the last detail.  Even though you hate to do it, we all do, you took the long walk to the neighbors house to ask the dreaded question, ""Will you water my plants while I'm gone?""
 
Houseplants DriWater can be used year round for your indoor watering needs.   Remember that plant in the guest room that always looks half dead?  DriWater to the rescue.  No need to write a note to help remember to water.  Ficus trees as well as other finicky plant love the consistent moisture that DriWater delivers.  DriWater eliminates the need to drag the ladder out every week to water plants that are too high up to reach. 

 
Hanging Flower Baskets & Pots We plant beautiful flowers and water every day, spilling water all over and creating a mess.  Unfortunately we miss a day or two and we end up with dry stringy half dead flowers. The only way to fix the situation is to toss everything out and start over.  Next time you plant your hanging baskets or porch pots, add DriWater and cut your watering down to once or twice a week.  DriWater will keep moisture available to the water hungry flowers and hydrate them between waterings. DriWater acts as a supplement for Annual Flowers and Vegetables. Helps keep Grandma off that dangerous ladder too.
Vacation Homes Many of our customers have a vacation cabin or second home.  They find it difficult to add plants to an existing landscape with the limited time they are at the property.  When planting those new trees and shrubs, just add DriWater and the watering is taken care of, allowing new plantings to thrive while you are away.  Our newest product has added nutrients, insuring your plants get the healthy start they need to establish strong root systems.
Vegetable Gardens In our quest to live healthier lives, we have become more aware of what we put into our bodies.  Sales of organic foods have soared in the last 10 years.  More people are growing their own vegetables and enjoying the backyard harvest.  Using DriWater in your vegetable garden will give you more than significant water conservation. This year we watered our vegetable garden only 4 times throughout the entire growing season, saving thousand of gallons of water. Our garden provides over 3,000 pounds of vegetables that we donate to our local food mission.  Watering below the top of the soil has other benefits as well.  Less surface moisture means, less pests and less weeds, saving you hours of time and that sore back.
Trees & Shrubs  It's never been easier to give new plantings a healthy start.  Using DriWater insures that newly planted trees and shrubs will have water available during the critical first few months.  Studies show that plants watered properly develop healthier root systems, allowing for better growth.  DriWater is like insurance for your plants.
 
Do you think DriWater is only used during the summer months?
DriWater opened a new market years ago with Christmas Poinsettia watering.  We found that churches and homeowners alike had a real need for help.  Churches use volunteers to water and that wasn't working out too well for them.  They had problems with over-watering, under-watering and water ruining their beautiful old hardwood floors.  Homeowners are so busy during the holiday season and adding those few extra plants just became too much.  The Poinsettia's would dry out and no matter how much they watered after that, the plants would never recover.  The solution was to apply 2 DriWater Gel Pac's on top of the soil when they first purchased the Poinsettia's.  With DriWater's slow release, the plants only need to be watered once from Thanksgiving through the end of December.
 

 


 
The perfect holiday gift or stocking stuffer  
We all have one or two people in our lives who have absolutely everything and we cringe at the thought of trying to find a gift that they would actually use.  You know the ones, they live to work and when they vacation, they are off to exotic destinations.  They have said it a hundred times, if only I had the time, I would love to have live plants.  But with the long hours and constant work traveling, it's something I realized I had to give up. Wouldn't it be great to hand over a beautiful Poinsettia to them and say, ""Don't water this, DriWater is on the job""  Give the Gift of Convenience this year.  DriWater will give them the beautiful plants they crave and no more black thumb comments.  Gifts can be ordered anytime and sent directly to your loved ones in time for the Holiday Poinsettia season.

 Why Plant Trees?

Trees are invaluable life resources.  They give oxygen to people, animals and the planet, sustaining life on earth.
Trees help recharge ground water and sustain stream flow.
Suburban streets and parking lots cool off when trees shade them, reducing temperatures.
Trees instill community appreciation, add beauty and grace to any community setting, calming people's nerves and may even reduce crime.
In 50 years, one tree generates approximately $30,000 worth of oxygen, recycles $35,000 worth of water and removes $60,000 of air pollution.
Trees prevent or reduce soil erosion.
Trees planted along rivers, streams and lakes reduce water temperature and prevent or reduce bank erosion and silt.  Their root also provide hiding places for fish.
Trees add brilliant colors to fall landscapes.
Research shows that trees help reduce stress in the workplace and speed hospital patients' recovery.

Commerical users of DriWater
DriWater is beneficial for many commercial applications.  It has started to become the ""go to"" method for irrigation in areas where water is not accessible.  As the world experiences long droughts, water that was used inefficiently in the pastis no longer the norm.  Agencies are looking for ways to conserve the water we have while continuing to plant trees and shrubs.  This delicate balance required something new and inventive...DriWater

Frequently Asked Questions 
 
What is DRiWATER®and how does it work?
DRiWATER®consists of 98% water and 2% food grade ingredients.  DRiWATER®is 100% natural and harmless to people and animals.  It is not a polyacrylamide polymer!  DRiWATER®begins to liquefy when it comes in direct contact with soil.The enzymes naturally found in soil gradually break down the food grade ingredients and  convert DRiWATER® back into liquid water.  The capillary activity in the soil then carries and maintains the  moisture throughout the root zone for up to 90 days. 

Is it possible to over-water using DRiWATER®?
When applied per manufacturers recommended usage, DRiWATER will not over-water plants.  Each 90 -Day Quart carton or Tube and Gel Pac will deliver one ounce of water every three days.  When used to establish native plants outdoors, DRiWATER®is designed to deliver only enough moisture to keep the plant under an  adequate amount of stress, which causes the plant to seek its own moisture source to sustain itself.  When used as supplemental irrigation to aid in ornamental plant establishment in an existing irrigated area, DRiWATER®is designed to deliver enough water to keep the root mass moist between normal irrigation cycles.  If it rains, the enzymes activity is reduced and DRiWATER®almost stops providing moisture.  

Does DRiWATER®freeze?
DRiWATER®freezes when temperatures fall below 25 degrees Fahrenheit and will not be affected when it thaws out.  Bacteria in the soil become dormant at approximately 38 degrees and, at this point, DRiWATER®stops  liquefying.  When temperatures rise, the enzymes become active and the DRiWATER®begins to liquefy again.
 
When temperatures increase will DRiWATER® liquefy at a faster rate? 
A little.  DRiWATER®is activated by microbial enzyme activity in the soil; it is not heat-activated like a common polymer.  In high temperatures, the enzymes in the soil continue to break DRiWATER®down at a consistent and steady release rate.  If the plant requires more moisture, additional DRiWATER®or supplemental irrigation should be used.

How can one Quart of DRiWATER®give a plant enough moisture when the  evapo-transpiration (ET) rate of the plant is greater than the liquefaction rate of  DRiWATER®?
In the first year of establishing an indigenous tree or shrub, developing a root system to sustain the plant is the main goal.  If a newly planted tree or shrub is given scheduled watering during its first year, it may encourage the plant to push growth (creating greater ET rates) that it is not yet able to support by the plants root mass.  When a plant is grown in the ground from seed, the root develops in proportion to support plant growth.  When plant materials are grown in containers and transplanted into the ground, it is important to encourage the roots to grow out and develop so they can draw enough moisture and nutrients from the soil to be self-supportive.  During the plants’ early establishment period, most of the moisture the plant is given will remain below the ground within the root mass and ET rates are lower than normal at this time.  Larger plants will require  additional units and high temperatures may require supplemental watering.  
Are there nutrients added to DRiWATER®?
Yes, DRiWATER® Plus and DRiWATER Thrive contain Zinc and Acetic acid to reduce transplant shock and enhance root development. Tests have shown an increase of up to 190% in root growth in 30 days with DRiWATER Plus. DRiWATER Thrive is targeted to maintain plants over time, providing continuous root stimulation. The original DRiWATER® formula of pure potable water and binder is also still available.
Can I fertilize while using DRiWATER®?
Yes, however, during the first year, when establishing indigenous plant materials, fertilizing with a high nitrogen-based fertilizer is generally not recommended.  When DRiWATER® comes in direct contact with  fertilizers, it will cause it to liquefy at a faster rate.  For this reason, when using fertilizers, it is important to check the DRiWATER® after 45 days.  
After DRiWATER® has finished liquefying what should be done with the Quart or the Tube?
The Quart Carton can be pulled out of the ground and recycled or left in the ground to degrade. It will take approximately 6 months to a year to degrade. After removing, simply brush surrounding dirt into the hole. If you are using a Tube, remove the Tube and use it again on another site or recycle it. When using the Tube over an extended period of time, DRiWATER® will leave a protective crust in the bottom of the Tube near the root zone until the time of reapplication. 
Does DRiWATER® change the Ph of the soil?  

No, DRiWATER® has a Ph of 5.25 – 5.5 and there is insufficient material to affect the Ph of the soil.
 
How do roots develop when DRiWATER® is applied?
DRiWATER® creates a moisture pocket around the root mass and extends up to 15” under the plant.  The plant does not recognize DRiWATER® as the water source as the roots will grow down deep into the soil.  

When a plant needs more moisture, does DRiWATER® liquefy at a faster rate?
No. Liquefaction is the process of DRiWATER® changing from a solid gel back into liquid water. The liquefaction rates are predictable and are determined by the amount of DRiWATER® exposed to the soil. If a plant needs more moisture, it is necessary to apply more DRiWATER® or use supplemental irrigation.",14.0,1,"1 Campaign

was launched in October 2011 by Dorcas International Institute of Rhode Island with the mission of bridging the divide between
foreign-born newcomers and U.S.-born Rhode Islanders to build strong, vibrant
and more cohesive communities across the state.
As
an affiliate of Welcoming America, we've
been working on it for two years, community by community, neighbor by neighbor,
using a three-prong approach:


  Local Leadership Development

  Public Engagement

  Strategic Communications
Welcoming
Rhode Island is guided by advisory committees made up of more than 75 leaders
representing diverse backgrounds and sectors including business, community
agencies, law enforcement, education, faith-based groups and local government. 
What We Need & What You Get
To
date, we've received support from private foundations, the Rhode Island Council
for the Humanities, and our national desk Welcoming America. We've also
generated earned income from the trainings and workshops we have provided to
businesses, schools and state agencies. 
In
order to keep Welcoming Rhode Island running , we need to fill a funding gap of
$7,500. These funds will go toward general operating costs, as we try to be
resourceful in keeping our program expenses low. 
In
return for your support we have some great perks! For every $25 donation we
will send you recipe cards with recipes that Rhode Island immigrants and
refugees have shared from their home countries. And, for every $50 donation,
you will receive your very own ""Rhode Island Is Home"" t-shirt!
 For a $1,000 you could have a private
meet and greet with some of the immigrants and refugees featured in our local story bank!
The Impact
Every
dollar we raise is more than just a dollar. It is a pledge to keep Rhode Island
a welcoming place for everyone who calls ""Little Rhody"" home. 
By
donating, you'll be helping to continue to the work we started that:


Encourages neighbors to exchange stories and profiles
how new Rhode Islanders contribute to our economy and enhance our culture

Participates and partners with events and activities
that highlight our diversity and strengthen community relationships
We've
been successful thus far, with our network of Welcoming Ambassadors helping to:


 Collect winter coats for newly arrived refugees who have
never seen snow

 Donating bicycles to help newcomers get around town

 Increase parent engagement in local schools

 Train employees on cultural competency in order to
better serve our community
Earlier this year, we even received the
prestigious Metcalf Award for Diversity in the Media for our bus ad campaign and local
story bank and that showcases over 45 Rhode
Islanders from 37 diverse countries around the world! 
Ways You Can Help
 There
are two ways you can move Rhode Island forward today:


Invest in making Rhode Island a welcoming place by
contributing now! Every dollar counts.

Spread the word! Tweet it, pin it, share it. Whatever
social media you use, pay it forward!

<div>My name is Kat Murphy.  I live on a small farm.  I am the butcher, baker and the candlestick maker plus the dairy maid, cheese maker and Momma to a handful of bottle baby goats.  I have been writing a blog, <a href=""http://selfsustainedliving.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""self sustained living"">Self Sustained Living</a>, since late 2008.

<h3> </h3>
<p><strong>Project Goals:</strong></p>
<p>Through a series of unfortunate events, I find myself without means to keep this farm going.  I need your support to run the farm and continue on the path I have started with improving the farm and building a commercial kitchen for the cheeses and baked goods.  The new commercial kitchen space will allow me to teach cheese making classes along with bread making and canning seminars and provide me with a steady venue for the skills I can offer to the surrounding community.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This year I have received my food sanitation llicense and my cottage exeption certificate.  2 big steps toward my goal of providing home grown and produced food to my community.  Even with all my small successes, I now find myself in danger of losing everything I have worked for.  I need your help to keep going for the next 90 days while I search for some sort of outside employment and build the kitchen to create the means for the farm to support itself.</p>
<p>1,200 to make the farm payment</p>
<p>600 to cover the electric use for the farm and my DIY contruction</p>
<p>225 to cover the insurance</p>
<p>240 to cover the water so no animals go thirsty</p>
<p>180 for feed to keep the milk animals producing for cheese making</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The storage house has a workable kitchen that can easily be cleaned up and brought to inspection pass levels.<img alt=""future commercial kitchen"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-r2Z8yMUghh8/Ub80fFqoRxI/AAAAAAAAChQ/2Xw4kj3V3U8/s1600/kitchen.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I know it looks rough but it's been a workshop of sorts and the house has been used as storage for the past 4 years while it lacked some basic plumbing and a hot water tank.  It will be cleaned up, the carpet removed, everything painted and brought up to spec for public health code.</p>

Even if you can't help me with a donation, you can still help me keep my farm and make it self sustainable by sharing this link and telling everyone you know about me and asking them to share the link too.</div></div>","Who I am:

 
My name is Kat Murphy.  I live on a small farm.  I am the butcher, baker and the candlestick maker plus the dairy maid, cheese maker and Momma to a handful of bottle baby goats.  I have been writing a blog, Self Sustained Living, since late 2008. It's a journal of the trials, triumphs, defeats and all around farm living.


 
Project Goals:
Through a series of unfortunate events, I find myself without means to keep this farm going.  I need your support to run the farm and continue on the path I have started with improving the farm and building a commercial kitchen for the cheeses and baked goods.  The new commercial kitchen space will allow me to teach cheese making classes along with bread making and canning seminars and provide me with a steady venue for the skills I can offer to the surrounding community.
 
This year I have received my food sanitation llicense and my cottage exeption certificate.  2 big steps toward my goal of providing home grown and produced food to my community.  Even with all my small successes, I now find myself in danger of losing everything I have worked for.  I need your help to keep going for the next 90 days while I search for some sort of outside employment and build the kitchen to create the means for the farm to support itself.
1,200 to make the farm payment
600 to cover the electric use for the farm and my DIY contruction
225 to cover the insurance
240 to cover the water so no animals go thirsty
180 for feed to keep the milk animals producing for cheese making
 
The storage house has a workable kitchen that can easily be cleaned up and brought to inspection pass levels.
I know it looks rough but it's been a workshop of sorts and the house has been used as storage for the past 4 years while it lacked some basic plumbing and a hot water tank.  It will be cleaned up, the carpet removed, everything painted and brought up to spec for public health code.
350 for a stove
300 for linoleum
80 for paint
275 for a hot water tank
100 to repair the broken water lines
900 for 2 refridgerators (one for cheese, one for other food products)
I already have the control box  and the moisture monitor needed for the cheese cave so I can age the cheeses the required amount of time for public sale.

<p>Hola,<br/></p>
<p>We are Weston LaCroix and Jessica
Schaefer. We are a young, adventurous, and motivated couple who love to travel.
We both have learned so much about our </p>
<p>surroundings (and ourselves) by
traveling.... we hope to further other people's traveling experiences by introducing them to the beauties of Cozumel, Mexico.     </p>
<p>We are seeking aid in living out our
dream of bringing people to the beautiful island of Cozumel for an
intimate Bed &amp; Breakfast experience at the Dive Inn Cozumel. We quit our
corporate jobs, sold the majority of our belongings, packed up as much as we
could fit into our carry-ons, and moved to a spectacular island in the
Caribbean. We have chosen to take advantage of an incredible opportunity to
experience another culture, learn the Spanish language, gain a unique
perspective by earning a living out side of the U.S., grow outside of our usual
comfort zones, and fulfill our dream of living in paradise.    </p>
<p>Cozumel, Mexico is a small island off
of the Yucutan Peninsula that boasts crystal clear water, white sand beaches,
and one of the largest and most beautiful reefs on earth. The staple of the
small and friendly community of Cozumel is its beauty both above and below the
surface of the water. People from all around the world flock to Cozumel to
experience the flavorful food, the hospitable people, and the numerous
world-class water activities. </p>
<p>We hope to establish a successful Bed
&amp; Breakfast that will not only allow us to earn a living but also enable
our friends and family to visit the beauty that Cozumel has to offer. We have
procured a 3 bedroom, 2 bath house not far from the coast and just a few blocks
away from Cozumel’s downtown square. The Dive Inn Cozumel Bed &amp; Breakfast
is located in in the heart of San Miguel de Cozumel; shops, restaurants, bars,
and water activities are within a short walking distance.</p>
<p>The house is cozy and traditional
Mexican style home. The first floor consist of the kitchen and dining area, the
living room, and a bathroom. The second floor consists of 3 bedrooms and a
bathroom. The top most floor is a roof top terrace that we plan to utilize as a
place to lounge and enjoy the views. We also plan on starting a garden on the
terrace in order grow some of our own fresh fruits and vegetables that we will
use to cook breakfasts with. Speaking of comida (food), we will be serving up some yummy traditional Mexican breakfast meals (and no, traditional Mexican breakfasts do not include breakfast tacos)!</p>
<p><b>What’s up with the name Dive Inn Cozumel?</b></p>
<p>Scuba diving is a hobby for both of
us. Weston has been a diver for a little over a year now, and I have been an active
diver since 2005. I am also a PADI Divemaster and SCUBA Instructor. Cozumel
initially drew us both in with its world renowned diving; the reefs that line
the western shore of Cozumel are some of the largest and most impressive reefs
in the world. It did not take us long to realize the benefits of establishing
hospitable accommodations specifically for divers, snorkelers, and beach
lovers. Our B &amp; B will cater to those who love and respect the ocean. We
will decorate our walls with colorful images of the Cozumelian reefs, our
bookshelf (once we buy one) will be stacked full of dive magazines and
interesting ocean books, and we will promote activities with companies on the
island who practice ethically and in the best interest of the ocean and its inhabitants.
For example, if someone wants to scuba dive we will introduce them to Chucho, a
local PADI Divemaster who has made his dive operation (<a href=""http://www.chucho-underwater.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.chucho-underwater.com</a>) “green”
by converting his old motors to more efficient ones that do not pollute the
water. We hope that through our Bed and Breakfast we will be able to educate
people on the importance of taking care of the oceans. </p>
<p><b>What’s unique about our space?</b></p>
<p>One thing that we love about Cozumel
is the bright colors, flowers, and hand made crafts that adorn the houses,
parks, and streets. In remodeling and furnishing our house we aim to do so in
an artistic manner that utilizes the materials and styles that are indigenous to the region. In doing so, we will we create a traditional styled Mexican casa that
is both inviting and stimulating to the local artists on the island.  </p>
<p><b>What will the money be used for??</b></p>
<p>Our house currently has no furniture. After
doing a lot of price comparing we have concluded that in order to comfortably
furnish the B &amp; B we will need to raise $9,000. This money will go towards
purchasing the following:</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Beds for each room</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>Various furniture (side tables, etc.)</p>
<p>·<span>  </span>4 AC units (and installation labor)</p>

<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">An Electric Car Passion is Born</span>:</h3>
<h3>Hi, my name is Kent Gubrud. I am an experienced attorney who ran my own successful law practice for 15 years and now runs a successful NYC realty business that caters to NYC visitors and corporate members.  Prior to moving to NYC and law school,  because of my interest in cars, I trained and worked as an automotive technician.  But about five years ago, I became intrigued with electric cars after learning about Tesla Motor Cars' plans to produce a beautiful, purely electric Roadster. </h3>
<p><img alt=""tesla roadster beach"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/331068/pictures/full/20120714131030-Tesla-Roadster_beach_-_ed.jpg?1342296636"" src="""" style="""" title=""tesla roadster""/></p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 240px;"">Tesla Roadster</h3>
<h3>Tesla promised its Roadster would accelerate from 0-60 in less than 4 seconds, have a range of nearly 250 miles per charge and run completely on its non-polluting, inexpensive and renewable electric fuel.  ""<em>Haaah!</em>,"" many said in disbelief (actually, I made that quote up).</h3>
<h3>Impressed and fascianted with Tesla's bold and unique Roadster plans,  I have spent and continue spending countless hours studying them.  I learned that electric cars typically have only three main powertrain parts (compared to many more parts on gas engines). The electric powertrain does not require lubrication or the usual repairs or maintenance. There are no oil changes or tune ups needed.  There are no valves, pistons, rings, crankshaft, camshaft or cooling system to maintain, repair or replace.   Electric powertrains do not have the same heat or stress as internal combustion engines.  In fact, unlike gas cars, electric power trains can typically drive for a million miles(!) without needing maintenance or repairs.</h3>
<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The electricity to operate an electric vehicle typically costs much less than half the cost of gas and can even be produced from renewable sources!</span></h3>
<h3>The more I learn about them, the more convinced I become of the many incredible benefits of using electric vehicles.</h3>
<h3>In 2008, to the surprise of many, Tesla delivered its amazing, all-electric Roadster exactly as promised --  the Roadster is incredible!!  It's beautiful and runs on quiet, non-polluting, all-electric power, has very low operating costs and excellent performance.</h3>
<h3><img alt=""tesla roadster in snow"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/331075/pictures/full/20120714131655-Roadster_in_snow.jpg?1342297028"" src="""" style="""" title=""tesla roadster in snow""/></h3>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 270px;"">Tesla Roadster</h3>
<h3>Recently Tesla has built and begun to deliver its Model S sedan which makes many more advancements.  This delivery has caused substantial excitement among many followers.  Model S can carry 5 adults and 2 children, has a range of up to 300 miles per charge, also with amazing handling and acceleration and gorgeous design.  Yet the base price is much less than the Roadster (about half with the smallest battery pack and range of 160 miles).</h3>
<p><img alt=""model S tesla"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/325452/pictures/full/20120711061121-model-s-signature-red_960x640_e_1_cr.jpg?1342012289"" src="""" style="""" title=""model S tesla""/></p>
<h3 style=""margin-left: 210px;"">               Model S</h3>
<h3>Of course, the final price will depend upon options chosen (including especially the battery pack size).  </h3>
<h3>Now, many other car makers are following Tesla's lead and introducing pure electric cars as well as hybrid electric cars to the market place (like Nissan, GM, Audi, BMW, Mercedes to name but a few).</h3>
<h3>Seeing all this, I became obsessed with finding a way to build a business around electric cars that could take advantage of their many incredible advantages (i.e. lack of pollution, lower fuel costs, lower maintenance, repairs and greater longevity) to help build a profitable business despite the high upfront costs. </h3>
<h3>
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">The Grand Plan</span>:</h3>
<h3>Then it hit me!  I realized how I would build a profitable, earth-improving electric car business that would be accessible to people of all income levels.   </h3>
<h3>But first, some relevant background. We moved to NYC about ten years ago and started a business in the tourist industry. The NYC tourist industry is  huge.  Nearly 50 million people visit NYC each year!   Rarely do any of these visitors bring their own vehicles. And few of the 8 million NYC residents own their own cars.  In addition there are many resident businesses (real estate companies, marketing, investment and law firms, television and movie companies) that constantly need to arrange transportation for their employees, customers and partners.  All of this means that -- in NYC -- limos and taxis are very popular modes of transportation.</h3>
<h3>Many associate limos with extravagence.  However,  given the</h3>
<p><img alt=""merce wolf limo"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/331108/pictures/full/20120714134211-merc_limo_wolf_ed.jpg?1342298543"" src="""" style="""" title=""merc wolf""/></p>
<h3>unique challenges of driving in the Big Apple, limos are actually very practical as well as popular -- and not only for those with substantial expendable incomes.   Limos with drivers can comfortably carry large groups of people and their luggage around the City without worry of parking, traffic or getting lost (and there are lots of big groups that come to NYC).  Also, critically, unlike taxis, limos can be arranged over the phone and internet.  For example, as part of our tourist business we frequently need to arrange airport transportation for groups of guests.  We cannot schedule taxis in advance (as they MUST be hailed on the street) and so we almost never use them for our guests' airport transport; we only only limos.  Similarly, due to this scheduling convenience and size advantages, many other NYC businesses regularly use limos the same way.  </h3>
<h3>Consequently, counting both stretched and regular town cars, there are actually more limos (14,000) in NYC than taxis (13,000).</h3>
<h3>However, limos are obviously large and lack efficient hybrid power trains that smaller taxis can often use (like the Toyota Prius). They take a lot of fuel and are expensive to run.  Gas expense makes up more than 75% of the total operational costs.  Additionally, with mostly City driving, limo businesses have significant maintenance and repair costs and then high replacement costs after relatively few miles of hard driving.  Limos also create much unwanted air, noise and water pollution. </h3>
<h3>But in ALL of these crucial areas (i.e. cost of fuel, maintenance, repairs, replacement and pollution) <em><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">electric vehicles far surpass gas vehicles</span></em>. </h3>
<h3>
<span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">Our plan is to start a limo business that converts gas limos to run on electricity and offer such electric limos for hire for visitors and residents at rates that fits most budgets.</span>  While some people are able to appreciate the many benefits, we need an actual, physical, operational electric limo to start. Once we have at least one, we will offer to transport hundreds of NYC visitors from our extensive existing customer base.  We will thus be able to quickly convert this limo into a vehicle that actually makes money, which we will then use to buy and convert more gas limos.  Having an actual electric limo that is making money will also make it MUCH easier to raise the investment funds that we need to build multiple electric vehicles.</h3>
<h3>Because our simple electric power train will be dependable for many, many miles, we will be able to purchase a good USED luxury limo with high mileage, providing substantial savings in our upfront costs, and offsetting the high cost of the batteries and conversion.  We plan to raise enough to start with a high-end Mercedes or Rolls Royce limo because of the greater rates we can</h3>

</h3>
<h3>all the other benefits.  Our operational costs will be substantially less than similar luxury limos powered by gas. </h3>

Hi, my name is Kent Gubrud. I am an experienced attorney who ran my own successful law practice for 15 years and now runs a successful NYC realty business that caters to NYC visitors and corporate members.  Prior to moving to NYC and law school,  because of my interest in cars, I trained and worked as an automotive technician.  But about five years ago, I became intrigued with electric cars after learning about Tesla Motor Cars' plans to produce a beautiful, purely electric Roadster. 

Tesla Roadster
Tesla promised its Roadster would accelerate from 0-60 in less than 4 seconds, have a range of nearly 250 miles per charge and run completely on its non-polluting, inexpensive and renewable electric fuel.  ""Haaah!,"" many said in disbelief (actually, I made that quote up).
Impressed and fascianted with Tesla's bold and unique Roadster plans,  I have spent and continue spending countless hours studying them.  I learned that electric cars typically have only three main powertrain parts (compared to many more parts on gas engines). The electric powertrain does not require lubrication or the usual repairs or maintenance. There are no oil changes or tune ups needed.  There are no valves, pistons, rings, crankshaft, camshaft or cooling system to maintain, repair or replace.   Electric powertrains do not have the same heat or stress as internal combustion engines.  In fact, unlike gas cars, electric power trains can typically drive for a million miles(!) without needing maintenance or repairs.
The electricity to operate an electric vehicle typically costs much less than half the cost of gas and can even be produced from renewable sources!
The more I learn about them, the more convinced I become of the many incredible benefits of using electric vehicles.
In 2008, to the surprise of many, Tesla delivered its amazing, all-electric Roadster exactly as promised --  the Roadster is incredible!!  It's beautiful and runs on quiet, non-polluting, all-electric power, has very low operating costs and excellent performance.

Tesla Roadster
Recently Tesla has built and begun to deliver its Model S sedan which makes many more advancements.  This delivery has caused substantial excitement among many followers.  Model S can carry 5 adults and 2 children, has a range of up to 300 miles per charge, also with amazing handling and acceleration and gorgeous design.  Yet the base price is much less than the Roadster (about half with the smallest battery pack and range of 160 miles).

               Model S
Of course, the final price will depend upon options chosen (including especially the battery pack size).  
Now, many other car makers are following Tesla's lead and introducing pure electric cars as well as hybrid electric cars to the market place (like Nissan, GM, Audi, BMW, Mercedes to name but a few).
Seeing all this, I became obsessed with finding a way to build a business around electric cars that could take advantage of their many incredible advantages (i.e. lack of pollution, lower fuel costs, lower maintenance, repairs and greater longevity) to help build a profitable business despite the high upfront costs. 

The Grand Plan:
Then it hit me!  I realized how I would build a profitable, earth-improving electric car business that would be accessible to people of all income levels.   
But first, some relevant background. We moved to NYC about ten years ago and started a business in the tourist industry. The NYC tourist industry is  huge.  Nearly 50 million people visit NYC each year!   Rarely do any of these visitors bring their own vehicles. And few of the 8 million NYC residents own their own cars.  In addition there are many resident businesses (real estate companies, marketing, investment and law firms, television and movie companies) that constantly need to arrange transportation for their employees, customers and partners.  All of this means that -- in NYC -- limos and taxis are very popular modes of transportation.
Many associate limos with extravagence.  However,  given the

unique challenges of driving in the Big Apple, limos are actually very practical as well as popular -- and not only for those with substantial expendable incomes.   Limos with drivers can comfortably carry large groups of people and their luggage around the City without worry of parking, traffic or getting lost (and there are lots of big groups that come to NYC).  Also, critically, unlike taxis, limos can be arranged over the phone and internet.  For example, as part of our tourist business we frequently need to arrange airport transportation for groups of guests.  We cannot schedule taxis in advance (as they MUST be hailed on the street) and so we almost never use them for our guests' airport transport; we only only limos.  Similarly, due to this scheduling convenience and size advantages, many other NYC businesses regularly use limos the same way.  
Consequently, counting both stretched and regular town cars, there are actually more limos (14,000) in NYC than taxis (13,000).
However, limos are obviously large and lack efficient hybrid power trains that smaller taxis can often use (like the Toyota Prius). They take a lot of fuel and are expensive to run.  Gas expense makes up more than 75% of the total operational costs.  Additionally, with mostly City driving, limo businesses have significant maintenance and repair costs and then high replacement costs after relatively few miles of hard driving.  Limos also create much unwanted air, noise and water pollution. 
But in ALL of these crucial areas (i.e. cost of fuel, maintenance, repairs, replacement and pollution) electric vehicles far surpass gas vehicles. 

Our plan is to start a limo business that converts gas limos to run on electricity and offer such electric limos for hire for visitors and residents at rates that fits most budgets.  While some people are able to appreciate the many benefits, we need an actual, physical, operational electric limo to start. Once we have at least one, we will offer to transport hundreds of NYC visitors from our extensive existing customer base.  We will thus be able to quickly convert this limo into a vehicle that actually makes money, which we will then use to buy and convert more gas limos.  Having an actual electric limo that is making money will also make it MUCH easier to raise the investment funds that we need to build multiple electric vehicles.
Because our simple electric power train will be dependable for many, many miles, we will be able to purchase a good USED luxury limo with high mileage, providing substantial savings in our upfront costs, and offsetting the high cost of the batteries and conversion.  We plan to raise enough to start with a high-end Mercedes or Rolls Royce limo because of the greater rates we can


charge.  But if we need to start with a less expensive Lincoln limo, we could simply adjust our rates downward, and still offer
 

all the other benefits.  Our operational costs will be substantially less than similar luxury limos powered by gas. 

With your help -- our unique electric limo business will be the first one in the world!  We have developed great business and marketing plans, which will help snag valuable publicity and attract customers who might never have considered using a regular gas limo.  By running on electricity, we will be eliminating a large percentage of the air, noise and water pollution that our vehicles would otherwise create.  Our business will help expose many new people every day to the many amazing benefits of electric propulsion.

<p><strong>My Background: </strong></p>
<p>I want to inspire a community change maker revolution! While I have not had a steady full time or part time job over the past sixteen months, I have been very active in my community. From volunteering my time to help develop a small non-profit to being part of the visioning team for an urban, eco-centric village project, my life has been rich with wonderful people, amazing ideas, and loads of generosity. More and more, I have been asking myself: “What would it look like if this were the norm? What if more people were able to do something like I have been doing?"" </p>
<p><strong>Past experience: </strong></p>
<p>In one form or another, I have been actively serving my entire adult life. Here are a few highlights of the volunteer efforts from my past.</p>
<p>1. In 1998, I was 1 of 8 undergraduate students honored by the Chancellor of the University of Wisconsin-River Falls for service to the campus community.</p>
<p>2. In 2004, after six years as a volunteer English as a Second Language teacher, I co-founded with five others an adult basic education non-profit located in downtown St. Paul. <a href=""http://www.fireprograms.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.fireprograms.org/</a></p>
<p>3. Between 2007-2010, I took seven classes of adult ESL students to the Minnesota state capital to meet and lobby their state representatives, and taught multiple creative writing classes for recent immigrants and refugees. </p>
<p><strong>Current Projects:</strong></p>
<p>I am currently offering my time and skills in three local communities: Clouds in Water Zen Center, the Whealthy Human Village, and Zintkala Luta - Red Bird.</p>
<p>Clouds in Water Zen Center - I am in my 3rd year as Chairman of the Board of Directors. Having sucessefully led the board's efforts to create an organizational development plan, including strategic planning elements for the next 3-5 years, I am now leading the board through the process of deciding what the Center's future home will look like. You can learn more about Clouds here. <a href=""http://cloudsinwater.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://cloudsinwater.org/</a> </p>
<p>The Whealthy Human Village is a grassroots, educational and neighborhood transformation project. Among it's chief aims are to support community dialogue, skills and resource sharing, and to promote earth-centric values and ways of living. I am part of the visioning team, and was a key contributer to the recent Village weekend held in the Powderhorn Park neighborhood. Check out the project here. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/whealthyhumanvillage"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/whealthyhumanvillage</a></p>
<p>Zintkala Luta - Red Bird is a Minneapolis-based non-profit organization. It's mission is ""to serve the people of D/Lakota heritage located in the Twin Cities area by providing educational programming and services to facilitate community unity and encourage cultural identity."" I am currently serving as a consultant for the organization, as it makes the transition into a full-fledged non-profit. Amongst the work I am doing includes grant writing, helping build a web presence, and supporting the development of the organization's board of directors. (While this position will be a paid one at some point, until the organization has raised a decent amount of money, the level of pay will probably not be enough to sustain my basic needs.)</p>
<p><strong>A Future Vision: </strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>To develop an organization dedicated to the health and wellness of low income, traditionally underserved populations. (I am especially interested in working again with recent immigrant and refugees.) The organization would offer programs in yoga/meditation, arts and writing, and alternative and traditional medicines, while being an incubator for cross-cultural connections and community development.</p>
<p><strong>Current Needed funds:</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>I have a goal of $3000. The funds will be used to cover basic living expenses. Although I have made a small amount of income from freelance writing work, it hasn't been nearly enough to cover expenses over the past year. My savings have dwindled during this period, but the desire to serve and to be a change maker in the Twin Cities has only increased.</p>
<p>I truly believe that it is our birthright to do what we are called to do in this world. In supporting me, you are also giving hope to others who wish to give more of their lives over to service, and to, in the process, transform the places we live in.</p>
<p>The three projects I am working on are already positively impacting hundreds of lives. And it is my hope than in sharing the skills and knowledge that I have, that many more will benefit.</p>
<p>The times are calling for us to re-place volunteering and community service back in the center. To cease seeing helping others and giving back as something some people do to fill in their time after work, or on the weekends. Please join me, and spread the word, as we together create a new revolution.</p>
<p>Please spread the word about my campaign, and about the groups I am working with.</p>
<p>My gratitude goes out to all those who I am currently working and serving with, as well as to the Earth itself for giving us life, beauty, and bounty.</p>

<h3><font>Our Story</font></h3>
<p><font>Hey guys,</font></p>
<p><font>we are three students currently attending University College London (Milana Katz, Ana Martins, Mathias Toubiana) and we plan on embarking on a 36 hour journey to get as far from London as we possibly can. The goal is simple: to raise as much money for the Great Ormond Street Hospital (Children's hospital). There is a catch, however, we cannot spend any money while trying to get as far from UCL as we can. Last year the winners reached as far as Poland and we hope to beat that mark while raising as much money as possible for the charity. We are devoted to and excited about this challenge and we assure you we'll do our best to get as far as we can. But in the end the most important thing is to contribute to a charitable cause and help children in need of medical attention. </font></p>
<p><font>This is all legit, and our progress can be followed by a GPS tracking system so you can know exactly where we are and how we are doing in our 36 hour ordeal.  </font></p>

<h3>Sharing is Caring! If you can't donate yourself, spread the word to someone who can!</h3>
</div></div>","Once upon a time...
If you're here, you probably know who I am, but let's recap.
 

My name is Hayley Jane
I'm a burlesque dancer, musician, make-up artist, and maker of things.
I'm 21 years old.
I live in my car.
I'm a sexual health and body positivity advocate
I'm also a faerie, but I don't know if that really relates to what we're talking about.

 
Some folks have expressed interest in seeing nude, partially nude, or just altogether more racy photos of me, since I do post a lot of photos of my burlesque on the internet.
So, here we are! 

 

I'm starting an 18+ paysite. Why? 
 

Because I want to. 
Because it's something I've been considering for a while now. 
Because it's a safe way to guarantee minors don't see pictures their parents don't want them to see on my watch. 
Because I need residual income if I'm going to make a living doing what I love.

 
[Because it's about damn time I get paid for all the work I do online!]
 
A lot of people, when they hear this, assume I am going into porn. Allow me to clarify. 
[Calm down, Mom, I'm not going into porn.] 
 
This will NOT be a pornographic website. [This is not to say I find anything wrong with media of this variety, it's just not what you're going to find on my website.] But we can still have fun, nerds & pervs!
 
What WILL NOT be on the Members Area of my Paysite:
 

Close up shots of my vagina worthy of a place on a gynecologist's wall
Lady-on-lady sexy times action, wherein one of the parties is one Miss Hayley Jane
Lady-on-dude sexy times action, wherein one of the parties is one Miss Hayley Jane
Footage, photos, or drawings of anything phallic being stuck into any of my holes

 
 
What WILL be on the Members Area of my Paysite:
 

Creative, sexy, original clothed, nude, and topless photos of one Miss Hayley Jane
Behind-the-scenes photos and video of shows, costuming, photoshoots, etc.
A personal blog
The first look at new burlesque acts, music, and other projects

 
 
 
How Billing Will Work:
There will 4 levels of billing. Nerd, Perv, Addict, and Stalker!



NERD: If you sign up for one month, you pay $15, with full access to the Members area. The recurring charge will be $10 a month with the option to cancel at any time.

PERV: If you sign up for 3 months, you pay $30, with full access to the Members area. The recurring charge will be $8 a month after your original 3 months, with the option to cancel at any time.

ADDICT: If you sign up for 6 months, you pay $45, with full access to the Members area, as well as a monthly newsletter featuring original content not on the website. The recurring charge will be $6 a month after your original 6 months, with the option to cancel at any time.

STALKER: IF YOU SIGN UP FOR ONE YEAR: You pay $60, with a recurring charge of $5 a month after your first year. You get full access to the Members area, the monthly newsletter, and more benefits will be announced after I discover more about the capabilities of the aMember software.

 
Unfortunately, you will not be able to join using PayPal, as PayPal does not allow adult content to be purchased via their services. I'm currently looking into alternative credit card processing.

 


What I Need & What You Get
What I Need:


A decent camera with which to take said illicit photos [$801: Canon EOS Rebel T2i w/ insurance, a wireless remote, and a tripod]
aMember software [$180], so my site can become a membership site!
New website hosting [$120], so's I don't get shut down for having ""adult"" content
To pay my graphic/web designer for designing a whole new website [$200-$300]


I've set this up so that I only receive the funds if I raise all $1500 over the next 30 days. If I don't raise everything, you get your money back, and maybe I'll try again someday. [I  realize that according to the numbers above, I only need $1401, but I did the math for the camera after setting the goal. That extra $99 will go towards covering fees should I need to use a new credit card processor, paying my web/graphic girl, or Photoshop.]

<p class=""short-blurb"">We will match pledges up to $25,000 in free CLP shipped to our troops in Iraq &amp; Afghanstan upon passing phase 2 at Aberdeen Proving Grounds. Newly added, we will also martch pledges up to $25,000 in Joint Lube to Wounded Warriors foundation and info on this product is at <a href=""http://www.quickenlube.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.quickenlube.com</a> making available a max total $50,000 in product with $25,000 in pledges.</p>
<p class=""short-blurb"">Update: Shipments should be out by Nov 10 or sooner.</p>
<p class=""short-blurb"">This futuristic ""Universal Lubricant™"" has already passed 16 of the most grueling, phase one tests for MIL-PRF-63460E amnd 3 at Picitinni Arsenal and needs to be evaluated at Aberdeen Proving grounds for final approval for US Military and NATO use. The attached video and youtube.com clips show the wide scope of applications for this diamond coating treatment, however it works anywhere friction needs to be reduced, large or small, slow or fast, high or low temp, low or high pressure.</p>
<p class=""short-blurb"">How is this new Diamond Coating discovery better than anything else before it?</p>
<ul>
<li>It reduces friction by preventing Metal on Metal contact,</li>
<li>Prevents wear under high or low pressure</li>
<li>Reduces heat by superthermal transfer</li>
<li>Increases MPG up to 35% or more by multiple means</li>
<li>Treated parts are much easier to clean</li>
<li>Seals rings and reduces head temperature</li>
<li>Smoothes out gear chatter</li>
<li>Works on tools large and small</li>
<li>Works on any bearing surface from small to large</li>
<li>Works in hydraulic systems too</li>
</ul>
<p>I invented this space aged product with the intent to supply our armed forces with absolutely the best high temperature, high pressure friction barrier available. In order to supply products to the military, extensive and expensive testing is required to assure that specific military standards are met. This product has already passed the 16 grueling phase one tests at Picatinni Arsenal, and is ready for the final phase of tests at Aberdeen Proving grounds. Once passed, this breakthrough product will be intergraded into the US Military. The last thing a solder needs is equipment jamming under fire, and our new Nanotech material stops jamming and reduces wear, greatly extending the useful life of treated parts. Any amount above our target shall be applied to other areas of advancement toward a better protected military.</p>
<p>Over $600,000 has been invested in this project which has produced a product that reduces friction so much, it increases fuel economy up to 35% while virtually eliminating wear in treated parts. As an added benefit, Soot emissions are reduced by over 50% as proven with oil analysis. Also rated Grade A by Gun Tests Magazine. If you want to protect your valuable machinery, no matter what it is, old or new - you need our treatments.</p>
<p>NanoLube, Inc has the ONLY license to distribute this patent pending discovery, and we currently have only Three sub-distributors, one in North Carolina, one in New Zealand and GrobetUSA an international jewelry and watch supply company. ANYONE else claiming to have ""Spherical NanoDiamond"" is not being honest.</p>
<p>Once funded, Aberdeen Proving Grounds will prepare for final phase testing on IAW MIL-PRF-63460-E Amendment 3. Previous weapons testing in Iraq have already proven the superior ability of our diamond coatings to provide jam-free operation of the M249SAW(Squad Automatic Weapon), however the Army must follow specific test protocols prior to integrating a new product into their system. The anticipated challenge will be keeping up with orders required to adequately stock depots world wide.</p>
<p class=""more"">The names of all Pledgers unless requested otherwise, will be posted on our Support Our Troops webpage.</p>
<p class=""more"">The options below are available to suit your needs, even though all options are not listed below. if you want $10,000 in small bottles, pledge on the 4 Platinum Semi Treatments - as it is no problem even though there is no specific listing, we are going for military funding and can accomidate any need.</p>

<h3>OUR STORY:</h3>
<p>2 summers ago in Massachusetts, a crew of two built an 8' catamaran and successfully sailed along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean.  This October, we explore the Pacific.  Over the past several days, a small group of filmmakers have been building a 16' foot, 2 sail pirate ship outfitted with a small cabin and captains deck.  On October 27, we will launch from the top of Santa Monica Beach and sail along the coast of Southern California, down to Marina Del Ray.  If our ship proves itself seaworthy, we will begin our excursion to Catalina Island, 30 miles of shark infested waters off shore.</p>
<p><br/></p>

2 summers ago in Massachusetts, a crew of two built an 8' catamaran and successfully sailed along the coast of the Atlantic Ocean.  This October, we explore the Pacific.  Over the past several days, a small group of filmmakers have been building a 16' foot, 2 sail pirate ship outfitted with a small cabin and captains deck.  On October 27, we will launch from the top of Santa Monica Beach and sail along the coast of Southern California, down to Marina Del Ray.  If our ship proves itself seaworthy, we will begin our excursion to Catalina Island, 30 miles of shark infested waters off shore.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Giovanni Jovanovic and I work in the deli at Founders Brewing Company.  A running joke, which is really true, is that everyone who works at Founders is either an artist or a musician.  I have worked with members of UV Hippo, Paucity, Bram and Dexous, Chance Jones, CIRCUS PIG!, Nicholas James and the Bandwagon, Lights at Sea, Afro Zuma, Red Frog, Total Blam Blams, Oracle, and a few other bands that I can't quite remember.  I came to the realization that I am surrounded by such talented people and I wanted to help my friends out the best way I could so a few months ago I took the initiative and started a record label.  Third Estate Records is based on the notion of a mass of poor artists and musicians uniting to change society to create a better world for all.  This simple goal is daunting, but anything can be achieved one step at a time.  <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>You may ask 'where does a button maker fit in?' This is a valid question.  Most people who speak of changing the world don't require access to a button maker, but one step at a time.  Third Estate Records wants to be able to produce band merchandise as cheaply as possible.  Sticker printers and screen printing machines are very expensive, but a button maker can be put to use right away to cut costs and help all the musicians I know.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Third Estate Records wants to purchase a Model 100 1"" Button Maker with a Punch Cutter Model 1313 along with enough supplies to make 2,500 1"" buttons.  To fulfill this goal Third Estate Records is offering custom buttons to anyone who helps fund this project</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>My goal for Third Estate Records is to be a record label that helps emerging artists.  I want to provide starting musicians the experience needed to grow into regularly performing artists.  This campaign is just one piece of the greater whole.<br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>Here are the actual costs<br/>Model 100 One Inch Button Maker: $194.95<br/>Punch Cutter Model 1313: $149.95<br/>Supplies to make 2,500 One Inch Buttons:  $149.95<br/><br/>My main goal is to purchase the Model 100 Button Maker.  My secondary goal is to purchase the Model 1313 Punch Cutter.  Any money raised that exceeds the first two goals will be used to purchase supplies to make buttons.  Any quantity of button supplies can be purchased, but the 2,500 amount is my ideal.<br/><br/>Any amount of money raised will be used to fund the goals of this campaign.  My own income is being used to fund Third Estate Records, and any help is greatly appreciated.<br/><br/>I want everyone who donates to become part of Third Estate Records.  The historical meaning of the third estate comes from the social hierarchy of Christian Medieval Europe.  The first estate is the Clergy, the second estate is the Nobility and the third estate is the peasants.  In France, the third estate revolted to destroy old ideas of hierarchy and embrace the revolutionary idea of equal rights to all. What Third Estate Records is offering to everyone who donates is membership.  <br/><br/>Since Third Estate Records is just starting out, the details of membership are still pretty vague.  The customary benefits of discounted merchandise, free concert tickets, and other perks will be offered, but I have something greater in mind.  Membership to Third Estate Records should include greater collaboration between artists and musicians.  A network that benefits everyone involved.  <br/><br/>Also included in funding this campaign is custom buttons.  Musicians will use album pre-sales to fund the production of an album, and we are using custom button pre-sales to fund the purchase of a button maker.  <br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Anyone can help with this campaign, whether you donate or not.  It is simple, all you have to do is pass the word along in Facebook, or other social site.  The more people who hear about this campaign, the more likely it will get full funded.</p>

<div id=""yui_3_2_0_15_133669414478192"">I work at a department store stocking shelves and got tired of stopping every time I need to cut the box open.

The increase in productivity alone makes it worth it, not only that our company buys boxes of the standard cutters weekly to replace lost or dropped standard cutters.</div>

<div> And Ive had the same one since April of last year, because it goes from your finger to pocket when not in use.

<div> </div>
<div>I only have the prototype now and CADs and sell sheet but have had the interest of utility knife manufactures.

Also during this 6 month time frame, I has to agree not to contact any other companies. I felt that that was too much time to have it tied up to be able to say no thank you later.. Hind sight is 20/20 they say. Maybe I should have taken the risk.</div>

<p>We are
The Mumpreneurs Networking Club, we run business networking events for mums in
business and those that want to do business with mums in business across the
South East (dads and non parents are all welcome). We have been connecting
mumpreneurs across the since 2009:</p>
<p> We have
17 groups across Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire, London, Essex and Kent, we average
between 350 and 400 visitors a month to all our groups and by the end of 2013
we will have had a whooping <b>10,000 </b>visitors to all our
meetings and events (we have an official Stats Monitor and she knows her
stuff). We have 2 Directors, a head office team of 7 and 17 Managers. Each
Manager buys a licence to operate their group under The Mumpreneurs Networking
Club brand. Members pay an annual membership fee and can attend as many
meetings as they want.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Meetings
are held at parent-friendly times: many of our members simply cannot attend
breakfast or evening networking meetings and appreciate the ability to be taken
seriously as a business owner AND take their children to school.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Joining
The Mumpreneurs Networking Club helps our members grown their confidence and
their networks, learn from each other and grow their businesses
significantly.And have fun in the process.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>We run
events which have included a Ladies Lunch at Coutts Bank, 2 Business
Mumpreneur Conferences, a large celebration for International Women's day
with Oxfam (raising money on the process), and a very unique networking event
at the Edinburgh Fringe. We are in partnership with Johnston Press, to bring
you the Women of the Year Awards  and we are involved with lots of local
events with Chamber of Commerce, local mayors and newspaper editors in the
South East.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Our
""good gossip"" has resulted in regular media coverage for our members
and managers:regional and national glossy magazines, including Vogue,You,Grazia
and Red; newspaper coverage from local paper columns to The Guardian; numerous
radio appearances,and even national television with appearances on The Vanessa
Show, The Politics Show and BBC South East. Topped of most recently with 1
finalist, 1 highly commended and 2 winners at a Business Awards Ceremony on
friday 27th September.</p>

""A good gossip"" is our URL, our campaign logo, hashtag and philosophy:spreading good news about great local businesses!
Update Thursday 14th November: 

Big Kiss and Virtual Hug to our 137 investors.
We now only have a few hours to go - we finish at  midnight tonight.
This is us when we started the campaign!! very chirpy and full of beans!!

 
and this is us after 45 days of crowd funding!!

    this is Nicky (yes she still wearing pink her pink jacket)
and this is Sara ( you cant see them but she is still wearing her pink DM's)  
Its seems the crowd funding madness has taken its toll on them both. MNC HQ has had a ball and is super super proud of the money we have raised and the investment we can make back into the business and as always we aim to create for our members as many business opportunities as possible.  
By the end of this year we will have had over 10,000 visits to our events and meetings, we have proved without a doubt that business networking works and is a crucial part of business growth.
We can now have fun planning what next??
PS if you see these ladies on the school run today can you please give them a random hug and feed them cake.





WE HAVE LOTS OF LAST DAY SPECIAL OFFERS - so take a cheeky peek

WHO
WE ARE


We are
The Mumpreneurs Networking Club, we run business networking events for mums in
business and those that want to do business with mums in business across the
South East (dads and non parents are all welcome). We have been connecting
mumpreneurs across the since 2009:
 We have
17 groups across Sussex, Surrey, Hampshire, London, Essex and Kent, we average
between 350 and 400 visitors a month to all our groups and by the end of 2013
we will have had a whooping 10,000 visitors to all our
meetings and events (we have an official Stats Monitor and she knows her
stuff). We have 2 Directors, a head office team of 7 and 17 Managers. Each
Manager buys a licence to operate their group under The Mumpreneurs Networking
Club brand. Members pay an annual membership fee and can attend as many
meetings as they want.
· 
Meetings
are held at parent-friendly times: many of our members simply cannot attend
breakfast or evening networking meetings and appreciate the ability to be taken
seriously as a business owner AND take their children to school.
· 
Joining
The Mumpreneurs Networking Club helps our members grown their confidence and
their networks, learn from each other and grow their businesses
significantly.And have fun in the process.
· 
We run
events which have included a Ladies Lunch at Coutts Bank, 2 Business
Mumpreneur Conferences, a large celebration for International Women's day
with Oxfam (raising money on the process), and a very unique networking event
at the Edinburgh Fringe. We are in partnership with Johnston Press, to bring
you the Women of the Year Awards  and we are involved with lots of local
events with Chamber of Commerce, local mayors and newspaper editors in the
South East.
· 
Our
""good gossip"" has resulted in regular media coverage for our members
and managers:regional and national glossy magazines, including Vogue,You,Grazia
and Red; newspaper coverage from local paper columns to The Guardian; numerous
radio appearances,and even national television with appearances on The Vanessa
Show, The Politics Show and BBC South East. Topped of most recently with 1
finalist, 1 highly commended and 2 winners at a Business Awards Ceremony on
friday 27th September.

<h2>What is Envy?</h2>
<p>Envy is an independent adult toy boutique specializing in safe, affordable and organic products. We will host events like workshops, seminars, lectures and socials, to serve the needs and desires of our diverse clientele. Our educational and social programming will promote a safe and welcoming space for women, men, trans and LGBTQ communities. Our store will be designed to encourage exploration of our product lines, socializing, and inquiry. Our hope is that, when you think of pleasure and sexual health in Chicago, Envy comes to mind first.</p>
<p>We plan to open our doors on the northwest side of Chicago in autumn of 2013.</p>
<p>Envy will feature traditional Chicago design elements like original wood floors, high ceilings, large windows, and vintage crown molding. While the standard adult bookstores are dark, dingy, and filled with merchandise in difficult-to-open plastic packs, Envy will feature bright colors, quirky decor, and floor models shoppers can see and handle before buying.</p>

<p>[store inspiration! what do you think?!]</p>
<h2>So what is there to Envy?</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>Since my introduction to the adult toy industry, I've been passionate about providing high-quality products made from safe materials at affordable prices. Envy will ensure that customers are educated about the use, construction, and maintenance of items they are purchasing. </p>
<p>Sounds simple enough, right? You might be surprised to hear that the government does not regulate the adult toy industry on healthfulness, safety and accountability. At Envy, we will provide you with a tailored, high quality and healthy selection of merchandise with just as many options, but without the damaging effects. </p>
<p>At Envy, only products that are safe for the body will be sold. I refuse to sell my customers anything that I would not use myself. Adult toys should be all about adding more passion, excitement and fun to your sex life - not infections, disease or carcinogens! This project is not only about opening one singular store in Chicago, it's about allowing a space for education and awareness to people everywhere about something that's really important - our health and our bodies.</p>
<h2>What is my goal?</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>To open Envy in 2013 and to spread my passion of providing sexual health and pleasure education to everyone who will listen. With this campaign, I will finance an education series, inventory to match Envy's passion, new technology and inviting design for the store.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Your support will help accomplish:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>EDUCATIONAL EVENTS</strong> - The store will welcome speakers and educators from a variety of backgrounds, to educate clients on topics ranging from enhancing foreplay to queer sex and tantra. Envy will be a resource for our community on sexual health and sexual pleasure education.</li>
<li>
<strong>INVENTORY</strong> -<strong> </strong>Safe, affordable and organic products. We will finance a collection of pure products - toys that are made out of pure materials like glass, silicone, stone, wood and others. Additionally, Envy will carry the luxury, high end toys and vibes that come with warranties and safety guarantees, but also well-constructed toys at a lower-price point made of safe materials. Those who cannot afford toys that cost hundreds of dollars should not have to sacrifice safety and health! YAY!</li>
<li>
<strong>TECHNOLOGY -</strong> Everyone around the world should be able to benefit from Envy's passion for safe, affordable and organic adult toys. A bomb website and online store, the ability to take credit cards, and updated technology for the store will help make everything run smoothly and will help us spread our passion to as many people as possible.</li>
<li>
<strong>DESIGN &amp; ATMOSPHERE -</strong> Bright colors, bold design elements, big windows and an inviting library full of books on sexual health are all a part of our anticipated atmosphere; in addition to all of the amazing sexy merchandise!</li>

Our impact is grand.  In 2012, we helped 6,362 people create a home.  The need continues to grow and we stand ready to help.  Our greatest need is for a second large truck to pick up the donated furniture and deliver it to those in need.  We have one truck right now that is overloaded with requests.  We have found a second truck that meets our needs perfectly.  The challenge is to raise the $30,000 needed to purchase the truck.  Once purchased, we can help another 15 families a week. </p>
<h3>What we can do:</h3>
</div>
<p>With this truck, we will be able to deliver furniture and household items to our client families, increase our donation collection capacity, and divert over 460 tons of useable goods from the landfills. Delivery service ensures that our clients do not have to coordinate their own transportation, a task that sometimes takes weeks or never happens, preventing these families and individuals from creating stable homes. This truck will increase our capacity to serve vulnerable populations including the elderly, those with disabilities, formerly homeless, victims of domestic violence and increasingly, the working poor.   </p>
<h3>Why we do what we do:</h3>
<p>""This afternoon I got to deliver a load of furniture &amp; household goodies from your Eastside warehouse to a formerly homeless family I work with who just moved into their own place. Their four year old, who was dressed up like a fairy, 'helped' us carry her new bed up three flights of stairs and immediately collapsed onto it laughing when we set it up in her bedroom. On rainy days like this I am so grateful for the awesome work that the Community Warehouse does. I know of at least one cute kiddo who will sleep much better tonight thanks to all of you!"" --<em>Case Manager, 2012.</em></p>
<p>Sometimes having a bed or pillow or kitchen table, can make all the difference for our struggling neighbors. </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help:</h3>
<p><span>You can hold your own fundraising campaign, host a collection drive at your business, church, or school, volunteer, schedule a pick-up, shop in our stores or online, and simply spread the word!

<table><tbody>
<tr>
<td style=""width: 360px;"">
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Travelsurf has developed a pioneering, value-driven, opaque online hotel booking model called YC@YP (YOUR CHOICE @ YOUR PRICE). YC@YP is specifically designed for hotels to sell their surplus rooms and for traveler's to find best value for their money.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">On Travelsurf.com, the ""negotiable"" price of the hotel room is hidden. Hotels list their surplus rooms, showcase their property and services while exposing only the best published rates. Travelers can book at the hotel's best published rate, or choose to negotiate a non-refundable lower rate from the hotel's surplus rooms.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left; margin-bottom: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px;"">They do this by creating a short list of hotels (after reviewing hotel details and understanding its value) and proceed to make dissimilar, binding offers for each of the hotel room on their short list. They also indicate their choice preference incase multiple hotels accept their offers. In case all offers are too low, travelers are provided a second chance to increase them. If the offers are still too low after the second attempt then each hotel on the list automatically</p>

<td style=""width: 360px;"">
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The entire process is conducted online and is fully automated without any wait times or delays. Since hotels provide highly discounted rates, all negotiated bookings are non-refundable, non-cancellable and non-changeable. Traveler's credit card is only charged if the negotiations result in a successful booking.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The model ensures the traveler has the opportunity to research hotels, compare them with other similar and not so similar hotels, and access the benefits of each one before placing the offers, while the hotel is able to sell its surplus, unsold rooms without disturbing the pricing structures on other channels. Travelers may short list different star rated hotels and negotiate with each one of the hotel simultaneously.</p>

<h1 style=""color: #960000; text-align: center; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 16px;"">THE FACTS</h1>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Hotel rooms are perishable, in that, if not rented the revenue for that day is lost forever. Most hotels, on most days, are left with vacant rooms they'd prefer to rent out at special discounted prices rather than leave them vacant. With the help of sophisticated demand forecasting tools, hotels know weeks in advance the number of empty rooms they expect.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Until Travelsurf.com, hotels did not have an efficient online distribution channel where they could sell-off these surplus unsold rooms to the public directly without adversely affecting their mainstream business. Hence in the past, these highly discounted, 'clearance' inventories were only available to whole sellers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">High distribution costs play a key role in inflating hotel rates. As a result of numerous intermediaries (middle agents) involved in the booking process with each taking a cut of the booking, a reservation could end up costing a hotel as much as 40%+ of the total booking.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Travelsurf addresses these problems by first, bypassing all middle agents in the distribution chain and bringing down the hotel's distribution cost dramatically; second, by providing a fair, even platform for travelers and hotels to negotiate the best price for the surplus inventories.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Last year almost 700 million hotel rooms were left unsold in US alone. In order to sell some of these unsold rooms, hotels need to offer high discounts to generate additional demand. The existing models do not lend themselves well to discounted selling in public, hence users face difficulty finding the best value for their money. Having to visit numerous portals and websites, and their search further made difficult by false promises of best rates and rate guarantees by resellers.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Travelers are expected to give up transparency (knowledge of which hotel they'll be staying at prior to booking) in order to get lower rates.</p>
<h1 style=""text-align: left; text-decoration: underline; font-size: 16px;"">CURRENT DISTRIBUTION MODELS</h1>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">At present there are primarily two types of online distribution models...</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">In the first type, you are able to see the hotel details along with the published prices, and can book a room at the displayed price. (Eg. Expedia, Orbitz, hotel's website, others).</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Since rates are exposed to public, this model is not suited for selling hotel's excess rooms at high discounts as it would impact demand and pricing of its salable rooms.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">A variation to this model is the 'Flash Sales' model that enables hotels sell their surplus rooms by offering high discounts on the last day. (eg. HotelTonight, others). For the travelers this model provides very limited choice of hotels on the last day and no guarantee they'll even find one. The model is only sustainable in a depressed economy.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The second type, allows travelers to book rooms based on its star rating at a lower price. Travelers do not know which hotel they'll be staying at, and find out after they have made a non-refundable, non-cancellable booking.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">In the second model price is used as the primary differentiating criteria among hotels and all hotels within a classification are treated as generic commodities that have no other unique differentiating features. Therefore it falsely assumes that the best ""deal"" for the traveler is always the cheapest one.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">An absolutely flawed assumption!</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The fact is that hotel rooms are not commodities and do not compete on price alone. They compete on many fronts including quality of service, brands, service standards, easy access, location, convenience, security and the overall experience delivered.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The model erroneously assumes a fair classification can be accomplished by segregating hotels by classification done by governmental and other authorities (such as star rating). This is a misguided assumption since the existence of certain amenities or the hotel falling under a certain classification does not make two hotels similar.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">
<b>Example</b>: A traveler may wish to stay at a particular hotel because of the proximity to a particular address. In this case staying at a hotel within a block from this address would be more preferable than at a particular star category hotel. So the subjective ""value"" to the traveler for a hotel at a distance, even if it's a better star rated hotel may be lower in this particular instance. That does not mean the traveler is not willing to stay at the other hotel but rather he may not be willing to offer the same price he'd be willing to pay for the one closer.
  </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Location of hotel, service reliability, security issues, service standards, brand loyalty cannot be defined by blindly picking a hotel classification and placing a single offer for these ""not so similar"" hotel rooms. It could result in the traveler ending up with a totally different hotel than what the traveler bargained for.</p>

<p>We are a young Indo-US company with our research &amp; development center in India. We have developed a suite of innovative, useful distribution models and systems for the hotel industry and are planning to expand into other segments of the travel market in the future. </p>
<p>We are a dedicated group of hard working, enthusiastic professionals that truly believe in what we have developed. We believe it would not only help the travelers but also help the Travel industry globally. We have beta launched the service in India and are receiving a positive feedback from Travelers and hotels there. We are bringing this new way of booking hotel rooms to North America.</p>
<p>We have signed up around 3,000 hotels through our relationship with a hotel consolidator in United States, Canada, and Europe. We are in the process of signing hotels directly and signing other hotel consolidators so we may bring better prices on surplus inventories and more negotiating power to you. We intend to offer hotel booking function for hotels in U.S. and Canada in December 2013. </p>
<p>We are the 1st and only company globally to introduce a unique negotiating model for sellers to sell-off their excess and distressed inventories and for travelers to find the best value for their money. We have filed for patents on this method of distribution for all perishable and non-perishable products in numerous countries around the world.</p>
<p>Travelsurf as a responsible global corporate citizen is committed to the education of girls in developing countries and the empowerment of women around the world. We plan to support this cause not only during this campaign but also as we grow and introduce Travelsurf across the globe.</p>

<p>Jim Burney inventor and founder of Travelsurf has over 35 years of experience in the Lodging and related industries. During this period he has operated and managed hotels in US and Canada, worked as an Independent Hotel Consultant, and as the Senior Hospitality Director for a multi-national computer company servicing the hotel industry. </p>
<p>Jim is a serial entrepreneur (a sucker for punishment!) and has operated his own hotel technology companies since 1985 (too stubborn to retire!). He’s been involved in the design and development of a number of innovative technologies for the travel industry, and has a number of “firsts” to his credit. </p>
<p>He was the first in the industry to introduce in 1986 a Unix based hotel management system running on micro-computers. During the second half of 1980s he drove the sales efforts for his PMS product to become the single most widely used PMS in Western Canada with a user base in 5 countries.</p>
<p>Jim’s previous company Inter-Soft Systems Ltd. was the first to incorporate yield management technologies directly into the hotel management system in 1989/90. In 1994 Jim focused his company’s attention toward online distribution and Internet. In 1995/96 Inter-Soft introduced the first OTA portal for the lodging industry, with comparison shopping and seamless connectivity with its PMS system.  Jim has been active in the research, design and development of a number of other technologies including a voice recognition technology based restaurant management system, Internet travel auction system, online travel distribution malls, and most recently the next generation Internet distribution network for Travelsurf.</p>

ABOUT TRAVELSURF



Travelsurf has developed a pioneering, value-driven, opaque online hotel booking model called YC@YP (YOUR CHOICE @ YOUR PRICE). YC@YP is specifically designed for hotels to sell their surplus rooms and for traveler's to find best value for their money.
On Travelsurf.com, the ""negotiable"" price of the hotel room is hidden. Hotels list their surplus rooms, showcase their property and services while exposing only the best published rates. Travelers can book at the hotel's best published rate, or choose to negotiate a non-refundable lower rate from the hotel's surplus rooms.
They do this by creating a short list of hotels (after reviewing hotel details and understanding its value) and proceed to make dissimilar, binding offers for each of the hotel room on their short list. They also indicate their choice preference incase multiple hotels accept their offers. In case all offers are too low, travelers are provided a second chance to increase them. If the offers are still too low after the second attempt then each hotel on the list automatically




offer with its best dynamically customized package price - customized to the traveler's needs. Travelers may book any of the hotel's counter offers if they choose to do so. Travelsurf's ISP (Intelligent Support Program) uses self correcting internal algorithms to track and match the traveler's needs.






The entire process is conducted online and is fully automated without any wait times or delays. Since hotels provide highly discounted rates, all negotiated bookings are non-refundable, non-cancellable and non-changeable. Traveler's credit card is only charged if the negotiations result in a successful booking.
The model ensures the traveler has the opportunity to research hotels, compare them with other similar and not so similar hotels, and access the benefits of each one before placing the offers, while the hotel is able to sell its surplus, unsold rooms without disturbing the pricing structures on other channels. Travelers may short list different star rated hotels and negotiate with each one of the hotel simultaneously.



The model keeps the hotel and traveler in control of the negotiations all through the process and delivers a pleasant shopping experience.




THE FACTS
Hotel rooms are perishable, in that, if not rented the revenue for that day is lost forever. Most hotels, on most days, are left with vacant rooms they'd prefer to rent out at special discounted prices rather than leave them vacant. With the help of sophisticated demand forecasting tools, hotels know weeks in advance the number of empty rooms they expect.
Until Travelsurf.com, hotels did not have an efficient online distribution channel where they could sell-off these surplus unsold rooms to the public directly without adversely affecting their mainstream business. Hence in the past, these highly discounted, 'clearance' inventories were only available to whole sellers.
High distribution costs play a key role in inflating hotel rates. As a result of numerous intermediaries (middle agents) involved in the booking process with each taking a cut of the booking, a reservation could end up costing a hotel as much as 40%+ of the total booking.
Travelsurf addresses these problems by first, bypassing all middle agents in the distribution chain and bringing down the hotel's distribution cost dramatically; second, by providing a fair, even platform for travelers and hotels to negotiate the best price for the surplus inventories.
Last year almost 700 million hotel rooms were left unsold in US alone. In order to sell some of these unsold rooms, hotels need to offer high discounts to generate additional demand. The existing models do not lend themselves well to discounted selling in public, hence users face difficulty finding the best value for their money. Having to visit numerous portals and websites, and their search further made difficult by false promises of best rates and rate guarantees by resellers.
Travelers are expected to give up transparency (knowledge of which hotel they'll be staying at prior to booking) in order to get lower rates.
CURRENT DISTRIBUTION MODELS
At present there are primarily two types of online distribution models...
In the first type, you are able to see the hotel details along with the published prices, and can book a room at the displayed price. (Eg. Expedia, Orbitz, hotel's website, others).
Since rates are exposed to public, this model is not suited for selling hotel's excess rooms at high discounts as it would impact demand and pricing of its salable rooms.
A variation to this model is the 'Flash Sales' model that enables hotels sell their surplus rooms by offering high discounts on the last day. (eg. HotelTonight, others). For the travelers this model provides very limited choice of hotels on the last day and no guarantee they'll even find one. The model is only sustainable in a depressed economy.
The second type, allows travelers to book rooms based on its star rating at a lower price. Travelers do not know which hotel they'll be staying at, and find out after they have made a non-refundable, non-cancellable booking.
In the second model price is used as the primary differentiating criteria among hotels and all hotels within a classification are treated as generic commodities that have no other unique differentiating features. Therefore it falsely assumes that the best ""deal"" for the traveler is always the cheapest one.
An absolutely flawed assumption!
The fact is that hotel rooms are not commodities and do not compete on price alone. They compete on many fronts including quality of service, brands, service standards, easy access, location, convenience, security and the overall experience delivered.
The model erroneously assumes a fair classification can be accomplished by segregating hotels by classification done by governmental and other authorities (such as star rating). This is a misguided assumption since the existence of certain amenities or the hotel falling under a certain classification does not make two hotels similar.

Example: A traveler may wish to stay at a particular hotel because of the proximity to a particular address. In this case staying at a hotel within a block from this address would be more preferable than at a particular star category hotel. So the subjective ""value"" to the traveler for a hotel at a distance, even if it's a better star rated hotel may be lower in this particular instance. That does not mean the traveler is not willing to stay at the other hotel but rather he may not be willing to offer the same price he'd be willing to pay for the one closer.
  
Location of hotel, service reliability, security issues, service standards, brand loyalty cannot be defined by blindly picking a hotel classification and placing a single offer for these ""not so similar"" hotel rooms. It could result in the traveler ending up with a totally different hotel than what the traveler bargained for.

We are presently developing the ideal travel blogging module to do this. Unfortunately, it is in the stealth phase so we cannot spill the beans until it's beta release late November. As our Travel Connoisseur we will set up your own special blogging board on Travelsurf.com. You may post your travel experiences, perhaps be the restaurant food critic, write about tourism attractions, review
      hotels, events, etc. We will reward you with special restaurant vouchers, discount coupons, & gift certificates from time to time, for your efforts and contributions.

18% of the funds will be utilized to complete Travelsurf’s mobile apps, integration and development of social media apps, interfaces to hotel ‘third party’ systems (such as Property Management Systems, Channel Management Systems, etc.) using Open Travel Alliance specifications. (These modules are planned to be completed and released over the course on next 90 days).

2% of the funds raised will be donated on your behalf to a charitable organization:

WE HAVE A SITUATION…
Young girls are being pulled out of schools every day in India, not because they lack money for the fees, but because many schools do not provide for girls washrooms…
2% of your funds will be donated for building girls washrooms in schools in Andhra Pradesh, India. You will receive a personal thank you letter from the principal of the school(s).








ABOUT TRAVELSURF
We are a young Indo-US company with our research & development center in India. We have developed a suite of innovative, useful distribution models and systems for the hotel industry and are planning to expand into other segments of the travel market in the future. 
We are a dedicated group of hard working, enthusiastic professionals that truly believe in what we have developed. We believe it would not only help the travelers but also help the Travel industry globally. We have beta launched the service in India and are receiving a positive feedback from Travelers and hotels there. We are bringing this new way of booking hotel rooms to North America.
We have signed up around 3,000 hotels through our relationship with a hotel consolidator in United States, Canada, and Europe. We are in the process of signing hotels directly and signing other hotel consolidators so we may bring better prices on surplus inventories and more negotiating power to you. We intend to offer hotel booking function for hotels in U.S. and Canada in December 2013. 
We are the 1st and only company globally to introduce a unique negotiating model for sellers to sell-off their excess and distressed inventories and for travelers to find the best value for their money. We have filed for patents on this method of distribution for all perishable and non-perishable products in numerous countries around the world.
Travelsurf as a responsible global corporate citizen is committed to the education of girls in developing countries and the empowerment of women around the world. We plan to support this cause not only during this campaign but also as we grow and introduce Travelsurf across the globe.

ABOUT THE FOUNDER
Jim Burney inventor and founder of Travelsurf has over 35 years of experience in the Lodging and related industries. During this period he has operated and managed hotels in US and Canada, worked as an Independent Hotel Consultant, and as the Senior Hospitality Director for a multi-national computer company servicing the hotel industry. 
Jim is a serial entrepreneur (a sucker for punishment!) and has operated his own hotel technology companies since 1985 (too stubborn to retire!). He’s been involved in the design and development of a number of innovative technologies for the travel industry, and has a number of “firsts” to his credit. 
He was the first in the industry to introduce in 1986 a Unix based hotel management system running on micro-computers. During the second half of 1980s he drove the sales efforts for his PMS product to become the single most widely used PMS in Western Canada with a user base in 5 countries.
Jim’s previous company Inter-Soft Systems Ltd. was the first to incorporate yield management technologies directly into the hotel management system in 1989/90. In 1994 Jim focused his company’s attention toward online distribution and Internet. In 1995/96 Inter-Soft introduced the first OTA portal for the lodging industry, with comparison shopping and seamless connectivity with its PMS system.  Jim has been active in the research, design and development of a number of other technologies including a voice recognition technology based restaurant management system, Internet travel auction system, online travel distribution malls, and most recently the next generation Internet distribution network for Travelsurf.

We want to add 10 more short term, furnished units in 2014, and then work towards a virtual hotel portfolio that rivals Boston's best luxury hotels.The cost of building a typical non-luxury, 115 room hotel in the US, featuring 325 square foot bedrooms and bathroom combinations, costs about $22 million. That is more than $190,000 per room and it does not include the contents.Purchasing nice one bedroom condos in Boston's best neighborhoods cost about $500,000 each, also, with no contents.Spare Suite can put together an entire apartment, with living room, dining room, kitchen, bathroom, and a king size bedroom for about $18,000, and with higher quality contents using our commercial lease of residential property. Spare Suite could assemble the same size, 110 room virtual hotel, but with 5 star apartments, instead or tiny rooms, for only $2 million, instead of $22 million.HOW ?:                                                                                                                We lease these luxury apartments from building owners, or corporate owners, on a commercial lease of residential property, at a fixed price. Then we fully appoint the apartment, and give it personality and style. We use high end furniture made of leather and wood, and enforce cleanliness standards that exceed those of first class, five star hotels here in Boston. Once the ""Spare Suite"" is ready, we rent it out short term furnished, for 3 days, a week or a month, depending on what our guests want. Currently, Spare Suite, Inc. is 17 months old and has 4 units. All 4 units are profitable and were funded with individual loan notes on a 24 month repayment schedule. Our lease agreements with property owners allow us to re-evaluate the location every year, so if one location or neighborhood becomes undesirable, or the view changes due to construction, Spare Suite can simply pick up the contents, and move to new location. Spare Suite's bookings are strong. The company is profitable and ready to grow.SO WHY CROWD FUND ?:                                                                   Until Spare Suite's loan notes are paid off, the profits are used almost exclusively to repay the principal and interest due. Without more funding, no new units can materialize.The availability of additional credit to expand in order to add new, profitable apartments is incremental. As the company's credit improves, expansion will become more rapid. We already have loan commitments for 2 more units in 2014, and we have the capacity to add 10 more units in 2014 when we secure the funding .Using the Spare Suite business model, adding one luxury apartment at a time, we can set up new locations for only $18,000 each, and achieve higher standards than any hotel in town, yet maintain the same or better levels of profitability. Crowd funding a unit will give Spare Suite the edge to expand more rapidly by immediately providing revenue that will fuel growth, rather than being used for repayment of another loan note.           Fund a New Unit & One New Job Follows With your contribution, and the addition of this new apartment, you also help to facilitate the creation of a new full time job in Massachusetts.      This is a new economy.  The Spare Suite model will become the preferred way to stay when visiting the city.  When you decide to provide funding for this unit, with your own hard earned dollars, you become one of our building blocks, laying the foundation for a strong company, with a bright future.What We Need & What Perks You Can Get
Very simply, we need $18,000 to put apartment #5 in play.  This covers everything from locating the unit, to purchasing the contents, moving in, insuring everything, testing it, and getting it listed to start booking.
If we EXCEED the goal, all additional funds will go to funding additional units.



If for some reason, we FALL SHORT of our funding goal, the funds that were raised will still go to fund the new unit, however, a much higher percentage goes to Indiegogo if we don't reach that goal. 

All perks will be honored regardless of how much we raise.




We are offering great perks like:


Stay as our guest in the newest apartment that you help to fund  - or use your stay to host your own friends or family
Help to name the new unit

Have dinner with founders and hosts Richard and Victoria
Get a Terry Cloth Bath Robe and Slippers

<p>CafeZAZZO will be the first and only coffee shop of its kind
in La Unión, with the hope of giving people excellent service, beverages
prepared to order, and a friendly and comfortable atmosphere to pass an
afternoon or evening. We will also serve many different flavors of homemade ice
cream, using fresh milk from cattle that are pasture-raised right here in La
Unión. In addition to the espressos, coffee, and ice cream, we will prepare our
own caramel sauce, jams and jellies, extracts, and other ingredients so that we
can serve you anything from caramel lattes to chocolate-coffee smoothies to
waffle cones topped with homemade sauces.</p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/178274/files/20131105171549-DSC_0955.JPG?1383700549"" src="""" style=""width: 251.352px; height: 167px;""/><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate""><br/><h3><br/></h3>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To this point, I have invested $4,000 into purchasing

construction of the service bar, install lighting and electricity, and finish
repairing the walls of the building.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/178284/files/20131105172047-DSC_0884.JPG?1383700847"" src="""" style=""width: 312px; height: 208px;""/></p>

<h3>What I Have Done So Far<br/>
</h3>
<p>While in the process of opening CafeZAZZO, I have spent the
past year making and selling ice cream. The ice cream has been a big hit here,
with many people interested in trying and buying the different types and
flavors. Since the ice cream is made with fresh milk and cream, it is of the
highest quality. The earnings from ice cream sales have helped me to purchase
the machinery for the coffee shop.</p>

<br/><p></p>
<p>Over the past months, I have also purchased all of the
machinery necessary for the shop. This includes an espresso machine and
grinder, coffee brewing equipment, a coffee roaster, an ice cream maker, a
waffle cone maker, and an ice cream freezer. Additionally, I have started
repairs and construction on the shop itself.</p>
<p>And finally, I have taken advantage of the time before the

Risks and challenges 

</h2>
<p>Risks being that with making soap, there's always the risk of 
being burned. Soap making can be dangerous but understand that I have 
protective safety goggles, gloves, and face masks to keep me safe. Plus 
I'm a big girl, a little burn wont bother me.</p></div>","I am a passionate home made soap maker on my quest 
to get my small home business off its feet and to renaissance festivals 
NATIONWIDE!


Nothing is more medieval than a Seawitch Selling Soap!!!This
 project to turn my small business into a huge success by traveling all 
across the country and selling my one of a kind soaps!Everyone 
loves soap, but I'll bet you've never seen soap as unique as mine! 
They're unique in every way and they are good for you too! They are long
 lasting, smell fantastic, and nothing like you've ever seen!The Main Goal:To get my big start, selling my products at the renaissance fairs all across the country!!!How it all started!I
 found my passion for making bath products when I suffered from eczema 
and asthma. The cost for medicines to treat my symptoms would cost me 
several hundred a month to purchase, so I looked into natural remedies. INTRO-the essential oils! After
 some research, I started adding tea tree, eucalyptus, and lavender 
essential oils to my shampoos, conditioners, and lotions. In just a few 
weeks, my conditions improved to almost nonexistent, and I didn't need 
my medicines anymore.This led to me to wonder...what ELSE can I add that is good for me?Lemongrass, Lavender, Tea Tree, Peppermint....these oils (and MANY others)
 have become a heavy part of my life. Now I have come to make, my own 
Artisan soaps, lotions, sugar scrubs, bath bombs, sea salt soaks, 
perfumes and bubble bath. And believe me...they smell as amazing as they look!



Now, I think I've done a pretty good job so far. I've made the product (in my kitchen), designed the labels, got all my packaging, took photos, got the website...now I need the place to sell. 
Given
 their appearance, I was going for a rustic, apothecary look for the 
packaging. So that, plus my nerdyness...what better place to sell than a
 renaissance festival?!!!
It's PERFECT! I've got a product that I'm passionate about, with vintage labeling, cool names (Dragon's Blood soap? C'mon, who WOULDN'T want a bar?), and I'm in central Florida...home of entertainment, actors, and tourism.

 and sold my products!

My first dry run with a fair was a huge 
hit!!! I wish to continue this success and keep my small business growing!



My sales were 500% profit from what I payed for the vendor rent!!!!!!!!!!
I know I have something the people love and want! Not to mention, It looks and smells absolutely wonderful!!!


So why do I need money now?With

Unlike any loyalty app, Subi connects you with people like yourself who enjoy indulging in their favorite things-to-do, but at the same time appreciate the notion that variety is the spice of life and are open to trying new things.Easy as Counting From 1 to 10Subi does away with the vague point-building system that you find in many loyalty programs where 50,000 points doesn't really mean a lot when you equate the amount to the value of the redeemable reward. Subi is here to enforce radical transparency. In this Subi community, every user is entitled to an exclusive reward when the user purchases a service or item within the app after the 10th time.What makes Subi’s offering unique is based on the number 10. There will be a variety of deals to choose from offered by a selected list of local and online merchants. Our featured Merchants offer specials ranging from: percentage discounts, 2-for-1s or free items in order to bring in new customers like you and also to maintain their relationships with current customers. Here's the sample list of cool things-to-do on SubiCITY TOURSRESTAURANTS NIGHTCLUBS AND BARSVACATION GETAWAYSFITNESSStill wondering How Subi works? Take a look at this scenarioHOW EXACTLY DOES IT WORK? HERE'S AN EXAMPLE;WEEK #1Step 1: Get Tickets to a ConcertStep 2: Book a Car Service to ConcertStep 3: Get Dinner at a fancy Restaurant WEEK #4Step 4: Book a vacation getaway to the BahamasWEEK #7Step 5: Get Tickets to a MuseumWEEK #8Step 6: Get Lunch at a Diner Step 7: Sign up for a Gym MembershipWEEK #10Step 8: Book a 3 Night Stay at a Resort Step 9: Book Car Service from Airport to ResortStep 10: Get Meals for You + Family NOW PICK YOUR REWARDSExample 1: Book a vacation getaway on Subi for 3 nights at Half-off (50% discount).Example 2: Get dinner at one of our restaurants and receive 2 complimentary drinks (Free item).Example 3: Get 2 tickets forprice of 1 for an event (Buy 1 Get 1 Free).EASILY TRACK YOUR PROGRESSThere’s a built-in meter which keeps a track of your progress from 1 - 10 represented on a scale of 0 - 100% in increments of 10% (See pic below).You’ll be on fire -- figuratively speaking -- in no time and your meter lights up in flames indicating you've reach your 10th goal.CONCERTS AND SHOWSStart seeing rewards from doing everyday things you do fast. Redeem your prize and the meter resets to 0%. Start again “clearly” knowing you’ve got ONLY 10 things to do for your next reward. It’s so simple, clear and concise; unlike airline flyer Miles that take years to build 100’s of thousands of points in order to win anything.SUBI WORKS FOR MERCHANTS Subi brings you new customers like ""Groupon"" with the incentives for current customers on ""Foursquare"" combined in one fun to use application.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Who I am..</p>
<p>  I built and flew Gyro copters in the 90's. I am using the same construction methods for this project. I am a level 4 Hang glider pilot for 20 years. My present occupation: Professional Military Industrial Contract Painter. I do contract Mil Spec work for local major metal fabricators in the S Florida area, and have experience in all types of fabrications. Also I have been building and designing model aircraft for 31 years.</p>
<p> I consider myself a minimalist. I believe that anyone should have the ability to get into simple, basic powered flight for the least amount of money, and complexity. I have found hang gliding to be the perfect medium for this concept. </p>
<p> I am trying to keep this design as simple as possible so that anyone with reasonable mechanical skills could construct one for a minimal cost from scratch from the plans that will be developed, but also have the option to purchase a simple ""kit"" of the airframe adaptable to most hang gliders if there is a demand. </p>
<p>  The ""Concept"" video above proves that the concept of this ""minimal"" flying machine is valid. My design will be improved, very light, fold able, and stow able into a small space for storage, or transport to your local field.</p>
<p>  You can view the progress of my design on my blog. <a href=""http://minimalflight.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://minimalflight.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> The funds raised will go towards the purchase of a motor, and a propeller for the final design/construction phase, as I have already invested most of the funds in the construction of the first portion of the project.</p>
<p> The funds also will be used to pay for the finalized design to be rendered by an engineer into a CAD program for the working plans, along with a structural design analysis to determine any weak spots, and possible improvements that could be made.</p>
<p>  Also, along with the structural analysis I will get a quote for a unit price to be produced from one of my metal fabricators for production. If there is a demand. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>
<p> It must be stated that any form of hang gliding is an incredible mind freeing experience. Once a person gets past the training, and equipment expense along with the fear of operating in a different enviornment, it can be incredibly rewarding!</p>
<p>  You can make any form of hang gliding, like most adventure sports, as safe or dangerous as you want. The biggest key to safety I have found in my 20 years of hang gliding, is knowing what your limitations are.</p>
<p>  Ways you can make hang gliding safe are to receive instruction from a certified professional and use safe equipment -- professional schools will create as controlled a learning environment as possible.</p>
<p> Hang gliding is an outdoor sport and the sky is unpredictable -- weather is always a big consideration. The primary safety factors are personal judgment and attitude.</p>
<p>  You must be willing to learn gradually and use good judgment and have an appropriate attitude. If you don’t, then you can get injured or killed; if you do, then you can enjoy this sport until you’re 90</p>

<h3>Why I need your help:</h3>
<p>I'm going to teach a free, weekly yoga program for parents of special needs kids at an early intervention centre in Melbourne. It's the same centre I first attended with my son (who has autism).</p>
<p>Many of these parents are frazzled. They're:</p>
<ul>
<li>anxious as to what the future holds</li>
<li>struggling to cope with meeting their kids needs(""Am I doing enough? Will my kid be worse off because I cant afford the thousands of dollars  needed for optimum therapy?"")  </li>
<li>dealing with their children's behaviour issues (self-regulating meltdowns and tantrums, some of which can be self harmful)</li>
<li>and a lot of them are doing it on little money and less sleep (insomnia, for example, is common in kids with autism. Sometimes my seven year old wakes at 2am and doesnt sleep until the next night.).</li>
</ul>
<p>Imagine trying to parent when your head is constantly bombarded with worry and you're exhausted. Can you imagine how easy it is to 'lose the plot' when your son and daughter is repetitively demanding something and you've been in a state of anxiety for hours? (or, in my case, years!) How can you be in the driving seat when you're too frazzled to drive?</p>
<p>This yoga program is about giving parents some 'me' time and sharing yoga tools to calm the mind, get grounded and oriented and parent, calmly and wisely, from our centre. It's based on the work of David Emerson and Dr Elizabeth Hooper (Overcoming trauma through yoga) and the wonderfule Hala Khouri.</p>
<p>In short, the premise of the program lies in the  the old airline adage: We're putting the oxygen mask on the parents first so they can better care for their kids.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>The good news is that we already have yoga mats thanks to the LovEarth pre-loved mat redistribution program. <br/>Now we need to acquire:</p>
<ul>
<li>Yoga blankets (an essential tool in making some asanas /postures safer and more comfortable)</li>
<li>Yoga blocks (again, this is for safety and comfort).</li>
<li>If at all possible, a few bolsters (but we can live without them if we get ther blankets and blocks).</li>
</ul>
<p>The program I have planned includes a lot of 'restorative' yoga, so these supporting props are pretty essential. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>A little contribution can mean a lot to these carers and the children they look after.

I'm going to teach a free, weekly yoga program for parents of special needs kids at an early intervention centre in Melbourne. It's the same centre I first attended with my son (who has autism).
Many of these parents are frazzled. They're:

anxious as to what the future holds
struggling to cope with meeting their kids needs(""Am I doing enough? Will my kid be worse off because I cant afford the thousands of dollars  needed for optimum therapy?"")  
dealing with their children's behaviour issues (self-regulating meltdowns and tantrums, some of which can be self harmful)
and a lot of them are doing it on little money and less sleep (insomnia, for example, is common in kids with autism. Sometimes my seven year old wakes at 2am and doesnt sleep until the next night.).

Imagine trying to parent when your head is constantly bombarded with worry and you're exhausted. Can you imagine how easy it is to 'lose the plot' when your son and daughter is repetitively demanding something and you've been in a state of anxiety for hours? (or, in my case, years!) How can you be in the driving seat when you're too frazzled to drive?
This yoga program is about giving parents some 'me' time and sharing yoga tools to calm the mind, get grounded and oriented and parent, calmly and wisely, from our centre. It's based on the work of David Emerson and Dr Elizabeth Hooper (Overcoming trauma through yoga) and the wonderfule Hala Khouri.
In short, the premise of the program lies in the  the old airline adage: We're putting the oxygen mask on the parents first so they can better care for their kids.


What We Need 
The good news is that we already have yoga mats thanks to the LovEarth pre-loved mat redistribution program. Now we need to acquire:

Yoga blankets (an essential tool in making some asanas /postures safer and more comfortable)
Yoga blocks (again, this is for safety and comfort).
If at all possible, a few bolsters (but we can live without them if we get ther blankets and blocks).

The program I have planned includes a lot of 'restorative' yoga, so these supporting props are pretty essential. 


The Impact
A little contribution can mean a lot to these carers and the children they look after. As UNICEF's Early Childhood Development(ECD) guidelines point out, ""ECD depends on the capacity, support and opportunities for families and the caregivers of children to adequately care and nurture their children.""
In helping us help carers to look after themselves, you will be ultimately raising the odds of their children's future. The aim is to use the yoga support program to reach hundreds of parents in the Melbourne area. Eventually I'd like to expand this program - I'm researching and planning a future yoga program for these incredible special needs kids themselves.

<p>I decided to make this project a reality because Max has spoken to me many, many times about his dream of visiting Israel, what he calls  “the motherland” which is extra special to him as he is an orthodox Jew.  He told me “if god wanted me to go, then he would give me a sign that would allow me to go”.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I recently spent some time in Puerto Vallarta and came across this project that is underway for the FIRST ever women's shelter in Banderas Bay.  Domestic abuse is something has touched my life and the lives of many others.  It saddens me that the women in this community have nowhere to turn if they are being abused.  When I got home I could not get this project out of my mind and wanted to do something to help contribute so that this project can be completed.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>I am trying to raise $1000.00 to donate to help with construction costs. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This shelter will impact the lives of many of the 50-70% of women and children in this community who face domestic and sexual abuse daily.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p style=""margin-left: 30px;""><em>Perfect religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after widows and orphans in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.</em> James 1:27</p>
<p>Dear Friends and Family,</p>
<p>In July I am planning to go to Rwanda, Africa on a missionary trip with True Vineyards Ministries. True Vineyard Ministries helps to meet the fundamental needs of people living in third-world countries that have been affected by HIV or other illnesses. In the 1994 state-sponsored Genocide of the Tutsi and Hutu moderate of Rwanda, more than 1 million men, women, and children were killed in a span of 100 days. During this horrific time, thousands and thousands of women were raped by HIV positive men in an effort to kill off the next generation of the Tutsi population. More than 67% of the surviving women are HIV positive with children who are HIV positive. In 2007, True Vineyard Ministries (TVM) started working in Rwanda. They have now employed 35 of the poorest women in Rwanda, most of who are widows and have children as well as raising children from family members who are no longing living. TVM’s goal is to provide opportunities for these women to become self-sufficient through various programs. The women working for True Vineyard Ministries use the money they earn to care for their families, have medical insurance and send their children to school. They also participate in counseling to help them heal from their traumatic experiences. They are taking part in rebuilding Rwanda!</p>
<p>I am excited to have the opportunity to experience for myself, the hand of God at work, through his people. Ever so humbly, I am writing with the vision of including you in His plan. My need is for financial support and prayer. In order to go to Rwanda this summer, I need to meet a fundraising goal of $5,000.00. I will be spending 2 weeks with True Vineyard Ministries, working side by side with the ladies. This money will pay for airfare, supplies, and all my amenities while working on the site of Rwanda. I’m hoping you will help support me in this exhilarating endeavor with prayers and if possible, a donation. ALL donations made to True Vineyard Ministries and are Tax deductible.</p>

<p>Today, 12/29/12 My family and I have learned that a very dear friend of ours Randy Starry, has suffered a great deal of emotional, physical, and economical pain yesterday, 12/28/12 in a deadly fire in his home in Greenbelt, Maryland.</p>
<p>Randy suffered a broken arm jumping out of the second floor in his home, though the arm will heal, his home is unsalvageable due to the deadly smoke and fire, and his heart forever broken as he lost his mother on this tragic night. </p>
<p>As his 88 year old mother was rushed out of the house by her nurse, who suffered 3rd degree burns, Randy was still in his bedroom unaware of the situation. His mother, who may rest in peace, fought her way back in to look for her soon, unfortunately by then Randy had already jumped out. It is believed she passed away due to smoke inhalation.</p>
<p>Randy was someone who took my family under his wing when we needed help; He has a huge heart and i want to be able to help him anyway possible. I Would like to raise as much money as possible, for anything and everything.</p>
<p>The money would go to things such as:</p>

<h3>What is PodFiber and WatchFiber?</h3>
<p><b>PodFiber</b></p>
<p>PodFiber is a community for PodCasters to connected with their fans and for fans to be able to find more PodCasters that they would enjoy. </p>
<p>This service is only limited to the PodCasters of fiber arts. Spinning, sewing, knitting, quilting, clothes making etc... If you are a PodCaster in anything fiber related, you are welcome here.</p>
<p>The PodCasters will have the ability to connect to their fans, hold contests, create video or chat sessions with their viewers and much much more. This site will give the PodCasters a support group from other PodCasters. With a PodCasters forum system to help build a support group for PodCasters, we strive to help PodCasters in any way we can.</p>
<p>All users to PodFiber will be able to create events, either virtual or physical to plan meetups either at existing events and expos or, creating your own spanning the globe. Using friends and connections, there will be suggested pod casts based on what you view and what your friends watch.</p>
<p>With the creation of our new Supporters Exchange, we will strive to connect PodCasters with people who want to advertise on PodCasts. This way, potential advertisers can get in contact with podcasters that they like to help support the services that they enjoy.</p>
<p><b>WatchFiber </b></p>
<p>If fully funded, we will also be presenting WatchFiber. With other video and audio hosting services shying away from pod casts and turning down podcasters, there is a growing need for a hosting and streaming service that is geared for you, the podcaster. If fully funded, this will provide the servers necessary to be able to provide not only hosting and streaming, but iTunes integration and viewer analytic statistics as well.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What Will The Funding Be Used For?</h3>
<p>PodFiber and WatchFiber will both be free services. To ensure that this service remains free t<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">he monies will be used to provide servers for one year. This will give us large enough servers with the bandwidth requirements to be able to hold both platforms.</span></p>

PodFiber
PodFiber is a community for PodCasters to connected with their fans and for fans to be able to find more PodCasters that they would enjoy. 
This service is only limited to the PodCasters of fiber arts. Spinning, sewing, knitting, quilting, clothes making etc... If you are a PodCaster in anything fiber related, you are welcome here.
The PodCasters will have the ability to connect to their fans, hold contests, create video or chat sessions with their viewers and much much more. This site will give the PodCasters a support group from other PodCasters. With a PodCasters forum system to help build a support group for PodCasters, we strive to help PodCasters in any way we can.
All users to PodFiber will be able to create events, either virtual or physical to plan meetups either at existing events and expos or, creating your own spanning the globe. Using friends and connections, there will be suggested pod casts based on what you view and what your friends watch.
With the creation of our new Supporters Exchange, we will strive to connect PodCasters with people who want to advertise on PodCasts. This way, potential advertisers can get in contact with podcasters that they like to help support the services that they enjoy.
WatchFiber 
If fully funded, we will also be presenting WatchFiber. With other video and audio hosting services shying away from pod casts and turning down podcasters, there is a growing need for a hosting and streaming service that is geared for you, the podcaster. If fully funded, this will provide the servers necessary to be able to provide not only hosting and streaming, but iTunes integration and viewer analytic statistics as well.


What Will The Funding Be Used For?
PodFiber and WatchFiber will both be free services. To ensure that this service remains free the monies will be used to provide servers for one year. This will give us large enough servers with the bandwidth requirements to be able to hold both platforms.
If we do not meet our goal, only the PodFiber service will be provided. As a unique social network, we will be able to provide all of the requirements for that.
If we are fully funded, WatchFiber will be launched along side of PodFiber to be able to bring both services online.

<p> Hello Lovelies! I’m Nancy Li, founder of Charity4Couture; a nonprofit organization that takes donated clothes, refurbishes them (such as studding, cutting, sewing, etc.), and then sells them on my website. Best of all, proceeds will be donated directly to St.Jude's Research Hospital and the Hirshberg Foundation.</p>
<p>A little bit about me: I am currently a junior at Chino Hills High School. I have a love for styling clothes and walking dogs. I grew up volunteering around my community and giving back has always been my way of life. I was taught that it was important to do the best I could for my community. This charity integrates my love for fashion and my passion for philanthropy!</p>
<p>It all started when I was in the third grade - my Mom took me to a thrift store and I immediately loved everything there! From the funky jewelry to the unique pieces, I knew no one had this stuff. Ever since, I’ve found timeless pieces at the thrift store you would normally find at a regular store for 10x the price! So I thought I could find really cute clothes, style/modify them, and sell them. I mean, why can’t everyone afford cute stuff while contributing to a great cause?</p>
<p><strong><img alt=""What We Need &amp; What You Get"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://charity4couture.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/WhatWeNeedWhatYouGet.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>We're looking to raise $3000 which will cover initial expenses such as materials, fees, marketing, and shipping costs. Any remaining donations from the campaign will be added to the St.Jude's Research Hospital and the Hirshberg Foundation fund.</p>
<p>What you guys get is a bunch of great perks! All the perks on the sidebar are personally handmade by me; they are unique and can be giftwrapped for a special someone. Also, you will feel all warm and fuzzy knowing that you are supporting a great cause! Look to your right for more info :)</p>

<p><strong><img alt=""The Impact"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://charity4couture.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/theimpact.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>I started this charity to raise money and benefit St.Jude’s Research Hospital and the Hirshberg Foundation for Pancreatic Cancer Research</p>
<p>And you may ask why I picked these two foundations. Every year, the Let It Be Foundation holds an event called the Dance of Hope. This event is held in order to make money for children with cancer and their families by having groups of dance teams perform and fundraise for them. Dancing for these kids really called attention to the importance of finding cures for cancer, especially in children. 3 out of 10 children will lose their battle with cancer every year and that’s definitely an alarming number! Supporting the research of cancer will hopefully lower that number.</p>
<p>Another charity I chose to donate to is the Hirshberg Foundation for Pancreatic Cancer Research. A friend of mine lost his father figure who basically raised him and I saw the impact that pancreatic cancer has over families. Annually, an estimated 44,030 Americans will be diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and over 37,660 will die from the disease. Also, pancreatic cancer has the highest mortality rate of all major cancers: with 94% of patients dying within five years of diagnosis and only 6% survive more than five years. If we can contribute to the cure or at least fund research, then one of these days pancreatic cancers won’t be so fatal.</p>

Throughout the years I have been able to take care of patients and make a difference. These patients have made a huge impact on me too and they have taught me a lot. I have been given the amazing opportunity to go to Zambia, Africa this summer. The program I am going with is called Nurses for Africa. I will be in Africa two weeks and will be taking care of patients in a rural village at clinics and at their home. We will be able to give some medications, do nursing assessments, treat some wounds, teach health education, and much more. I have always dreamed to go to Africa and help out those in need, and this is my opportunity to do so. I cannot go to Africa unless I am able to raise money to go on the trip. Any money donated over my goal will be used as donations to the people in the rural villages. I urge you to think and pray about my campaign, and give in any way you are able. I thank you in advance for considering to fund my trip to Africa. I am eager to go to Africa and to be given the opportunity to use my skill of nursing to help those in need.</div><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p> In order to fund my trip I will need $3900. This will include airplane ticket, overnight accommodations, transportation in Africa, supplies for home visits and food. Any money donated over $3900 will be used as donations to the rural village in Africa. If I do not raise the $3900, I will not be able to go to Africa. The funds will essentially get me to Africa and allow me to take care of people in Africa. I will be able to teach women, men, and children about their health. This teaching will include many subjects varying for healthy eating habits, women health including maternity, medications, and many more If you feel moved to help fund my trip, I genuinely appreciate it.  </p><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>By giving to my trip, you are helping support those less fortunate than yourself.

I graduated nursing school two years and began working. Throughout the years I have been able to take care of patients and make a difference. These patients have made a huge impact on me too and they have taught me a lot. I have been given the amazing opportunity to go to Zambia, Africa this summer. The program I am going with is called Nurses for Africa. I will be in Africa two weeks and will be taking care of patients in a rural village at clinics and at their home. We will be able to give some medications, do nursing assessments, treat some wounds, teach health education, and much more. I have always dreamed to go to Africa and help out those in need, and this is my opportunity to do so. I cannot go to Africa unless I am able to raise money to go on the trip. Any money donated over my goal will be used as donations to the people in the rural villages. I urge you to think and pray about my campaign, and give in any way you are able. I thank you in advance for considering to fund my trip to Africa. I am eager to go to Africa and to be given the opportunity to use my skill of nursing to help those in need.What We Need & What You Get In order to fund my trip I will need $3900. This will include airplane ticket, overnight accommodations, transportation in Africa, supplies for home visits and food. Any money donated over $3900 will be used as donations to the rural village in Africa. If I do not raise the $3900, I will not be able to go to Africa. The funds will essentially get me to Africa and allow me to take care of people in Africa. I will be able to teach women, men, and children about their health. This teaching will include many subjects varying for healthy eating habits, women health including maternity, medications, and many more If you feel moved to help fund my trip, I genuinely appreciate it.  The ImpactBy giving to my trip, you are helping support those less fortunate than yourself. You are helping those that do not have resources for when they are sick. Many of the people I will be helping, need education and supplies in order to get healthy again or to just relieve their symptoms. By helping to fund my trip, you are allowing me to be the hands and feet and be able to make a difference in these peoples lives.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you are able to contribute to my campaign, I really appreciate it and will be infinitely grateful.

<br/><h3>SASIL JA</h3>
<div>Sasil Ja, meaning clear water in Mayan, pronounced ""saw-seal ha"" ; is an indigenous Mayan preschool/kindergarten located in southern Yucatan, Mexico in a small town named Dzan. Please help us raise funds to provide food and water to the school for an entire school year. Here is some important information you should know: </div>
<div>Sasil Ja currently has 86 students, ranging from age 3 - 6. This is considered pre-schooling. (1st year, age 3-4) (2nd year, age 4-5) (3rd year, age 5-6). After the third year of pre-schooling/kindergarten they are promoted to Primary school. </div>
<div>The facility currently in use is a house rented by the town of Dzan for the children of Sasil Ja. The children are in 3 classrooms, with no air conditioning, fans or clean water to drink. There is one bathroom for 86 students and all faculty. </div>
<div>Meals are provided to the children at a cost of $6.00 pesos per day. For many of these children this is the only meal that they can eat as theirs. With the traditional family sizes here being very large, sharing a meal and the same plate and bowls of food with siblings is the norm. </div>
<div>Children are in school from 8AM - 11AM. Due to the heat, classes for these age children are in the mornings. The temperature here in the Yucatan can easily reach 100 degrees by 11AM.  This is why it is so necessary to make sure the children have fresh purified bottled water to drink when they want it.  The ground water here is no longer safe for people to drink. The faculty provides 20liter bottles of water out of pocket when they have the funds to do so. When they can't purchase water, the children must do without until they can reach home. </div> <p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>This is the goal we need to reach and why. </h3>

<p>Hi there. I'm Sarah, a single mother of a beautiful 5 year old named Owen. I work from home by sewing so I can stay with him. While that seems like a good idea in theory, reality has me working 12 to 14 hour days most of the time. I'm there, though, any time he needs me or wants to pop into my sewing room. We live with my 64 year old disabled mother and 18 year old cousin. We've had custody of my cousin for 4 years now, ever since my uncle died unexpectedly. Her mother was best left out of the picture, so we fought for her and won. She's faced so many challenges in life and survived to tell the tale. We wanted to protect her from any other traumas. I hope we've done that.</p>
<h3>When life hands you lemons...</h3>
<p>You're supposed to be able to make lemonade from it, right? But what if you don't have the sugar? That's what this last few months have felt like, for sure. The downward spiral started in earnest in March, when my doctor suspected I had gallbladder issues. I'd been feeling absolutely horrible for months, but my then current physician wouldn't really listen to me. I wised up and changed to a new doctor who was a little more concerned with her patients rather than how much money she could roll in within an hour. The very first visit, she found the first signs. <br/></p>
<p>That's when Murphy kicked in. What could go wrong did go wrong. It started with tests being rescheduled, then insurance refusing to cover doctors and hospitals. Once we finally discovered that my gallbladder was very inflamed and I had multiple gallstones, I had to wait to find a new surgeon. And then they called to reschedule. Twice. The longer I waited, the sicker I got, until, 3 months after the original diagnosis, I ended up being rushed to the hospital in an ambulance. I had emergency surgery that day. I wouldn't wish that on anyone. I've never been in so much pain in my life, childbirth included.</p>
<p>At the same time, we were facing another battle. We were homeschooling my cousin, mostly because the local school is on the verge of bankruptcy and she was learning nothing there. We want her to be prepared for her future, not passed along just to get her to the next grade. Because of her dad's premature death, she's been receiving survivors' benefits. We were told that would continue until she graduated or turned 19. We use an accredited school that works under every rule the state of Texas has for homeschooling. June came, and her benefits stopped. We were reeling. Suddenly losing $600 without notice is a blow. If you've ever dealt with the government, you know the hoops and red tape that you have to go through just to talk to someone. We sat on the phone for hours. We went to the somewhat local office numerous times. We were told one thing, which was countered by another. We did everything they told us to, and they still wouldn't reinstate her benefits. This was all going on while I was declining faster and faster. I couldn't work. I could barely move without incredible bouts of pain. <br/></p>
<p>On June 12th, I had my surgery. I was hoping for great things, that I would be back to my normal routine within the week, like the surgeon and nurses kept telling me I would be. The first warning sign was staying in the hospital for a day longer than normal. It's been 6 weeks since the surgery. I'm only just now beginning to get back on my feet. I'm still battling with ever-present pain and intermittent nausea. I've been in the emergency room twice since my surgery. </p>
<p>The day after I came home from the hospital, we started the fight back up again with Social Security. We were able to breathe a sigh of relief week or so later when the case worker told us it was a go, that we probably wouldn't get June back, but we would get the July payment. It didn't come. We started sitting on the phone again to try to find out what happened. The caseworker never returned our calls. Just yesterday, we were finally able to get through to them. Now we have to bring them receipts proving that we bought the school books, even though we've already brought the actual books into the office for them to copy. These are things that are NOT required by Texas law. We've been over it with a fine toothed comb.</p>
<h3>The Last Straw</h3>
<p>The straw that broke the camel's back came Sunday, when our landlord knocked on our door with an eviction notice. She's been working with us, and she's been great about it, but we're two notes behind. We pay $600 a month. If we can just get one note in by August 10th, she'll put one note into payments added onto the rent, so we'll owe $700 a month for the next 6 months. Fees from fundraising and Paypal are going to bring that up to $800. It's a lot, but I'm just not sure what else to do at this point. We've been told the benefits will start again, but who knows when. You can't borrow from people without knowing when you can pay it back. Moving right now isn't even an option. I'm physically not able to lift anything over 20 lbs for the next month, at the very least. <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What I'm Asking For<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p>I'm not asking for simple donations. I'm asking you to help me work. I
 do so many different things, it's hard to remember them. I've done 
graphic work in Photoshop. I've designed products for the Patriot Guard 
Riders, back when I was managing their store for a few years. I've been 
sewing for the online public for 10 years. In my costuming and prop 
making, I've done leatherworking, stencil making, painting, embroidery, 
pattern drafting, jewelry making, quilting, doll making, sketching, and more. You can find a small amount of my work in my <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/aranel/photos_albums"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook albums</a>. I've also been working on genealogy, just in case anyone would be interested in that. I've researched ours back to the year 800 A.D.<br/></p>
<p>Above all, thank you for making it this far with me! </p>

I wised up and changed to a new doctor who was a little more concerned with her patients rather than how much money she could roll in within an hour. The very first visit, she found the first signs. 
That's when Murphy kicked in. What could go wrong did go wrong. It started with tests being rescheduled, then insurance refusing to cover doctors and hospitals. Once we finally discovered that my gallbladder was very inflamed and I had multiple gallstones, I had to wait to find a new surgeon. And then they called to reschedule. Twice. The longer I waited, the sicker I got, until, 3 months after the original diagnosis, I ended up being rushed to the hospital in an ambulance. I had emergency surgery that day. I wouldn't wish that on anyone. I've never been in so much pain in my life, childbirth included.
At the same time, we were facing another battle. We were homeschooling my cousin, mostly because the local school is on the verge of bankruptcy and she was learning nothing there. We want her to be prepared for her future, not passed along just to get her to the next grade. Because of her dad's premature death, she's been receiving survivors' benefits. We were told that would continue until she graduated or turned 19. We use an accredited school that works under every rule the state of Texas has for homeschooling. June came, and her benefits stopped. We were reeling. Suddenly losing $600 without notice is a blow. If you've ever dealt with the government, you know the hoops and red tape that you have to go through just to talk to someone. We sat on the phone for hours. We went to the somewhat local office numerous times. We were told one thing, which was countered by another. We did everything they told us to, and they still wouldn't reinstate her benefits. This was all going on while I was declining faster and faster. I couldn't work. I could barely move without incredible bouts of pain. 
On June 12th, I had my surgery. I was hoping for great things, that I would be back to my normal routine within the week, like the surgeon and nurses kept telling me I would be. The first warning sign was staying in the hospital for a day longer than normal. It's been 6 weeks since the surgery. I'm only just now beginning to get back on my feet. I'm still battling with ever-present pain and intermittent nausea. I've been in the emergency room twice since my surgery. 
The day after I came home from the hospital, we started the fight back up again with Social Security. We were able to breathe a sigh of relief week or so later when the case worker told us it was a go, that we probably wouldn't get June back, but we would get the July payment. It didn't come. We started sitting on the phone again to try to find out what happened. The caseworker never returned our calls. Just yesterday, we were finally able to get through to them. Now we have to bring them receipts proving that we bought the school books, even though we've already brought the actual books into the office for them to copy. These are things that are NOT required by Texas law. We've been over it with a fine toothed comb.
The Last Straw
The straw that broke the camel's back came Sunday, when our landlord knocked on our door with an eviction notice. She's been working with us, and she's been great about it, but we're two notes behind. We pay $600 a month. If we can just get one note in by August 10th, she'll put one note into payments added onto the rent, so we'll owe $700 a month for the next 6 months. Fees from fundraising and Paypal are going to bring that up to $800. It's a lot, but I'm just not sure what else to do at this point. We've been told the benefits will start again, but who knows when. You can't borrow from people without knowing when you can pay it back. Moving right now isn't even an option. I'm physically not able to lift anything over 20 lbs for the next month, at the very least. 
  What I'm Asking For
 
I'm not asking for simple donations. I'm asking you to help me work. I
 do so many different things, it's hard to remember them. I've done 
graphic work in Photoshop. I've designed products for the Patriot Guard 
Riders, back when I was managing their store for a few years. I've been 
sewing for the online public for 10 years. In my costuming and prop 
making, I've done leatherworking, stencil making, painting, embroidery, 
pattern drafting, jewelry making, quilting, doll making, sketching, and more. You can find a small amount of my work in my Facebook albums. I've also been working on genealogy, just in case anyone would be interested in that. I've researched ours back to the year 800 A.D.
Above all, thank you for making it this far with me!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p><p><b>Hippotherapy in Sudan– the Miracle of
Healing with Horses for Special Needs Children</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>There is an estimated
720,000 (2008 Sudan census) children with disabilities in Sudan. Treatments are
limited and expensive. Disabilities are still a taboo and those suffering them
are often discriminated against. Furthermore, formal education in the country
does not provide for children with special needs and families find themselves
alone caring for, treating and raising the children all by themselves. </p>
<p>Jane-anne moved to Sudan
years ago and rooted herself in the country quickly, founding a family that
today goes well beyond her husband Yassin and her 8 children. At the
Miracles-Sudan Farm, established at its present location since the year 2000,
there are 13 rescued horses, 3 donkeys and a mule!  An average of 60 Sudanese special needs
children undergo hippotherapy every week. As most of their families have very
limited resources and governmental and private support is particularly
limited, therapy is provided for free and with the help of dozens of
volunteers.</p>
<p>Miracle-Sudan farm does not
only provide a treatment strategy which is internationally recognised as
effective in many different contexts and for many disabilities. It gives
children and their families hope for a better future, a better quality of life
and the dignity that comes from knowing that they are doing their best. The
farm is also a place for families to meet and discuss common problems,
experiences and solutions and for the children to socialize.</p>
<p>Jane-anne has embarked on
the construction of stables for the horses and other animals, as well as a
centre that will function as a safe and nurturing environment for these children
and their families, a space where they will have an opportunity to grow and
develop.</p>
<p>Miracle-Sudan farm needs
your support in continuing to provide children with the treatment they so badly
need as well as to finalise construction of the centre. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Some examples of what your money will do:</p>
<p>A one and a half hour group therapy session, for an average of
12 children costs on 50 USD</p>
<p>Feeding and additional expenses (vet, farrier, wormers ect) of one
horse per month is 250 USD</p>
<p>2,150 USD  will pay for the construction of a kitchen and all
its equipment in the centre.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jane-anne has made plans
for income generating activities to complement your generous contributions.
Already, funding comes in through lessons to children without disabilities, second
hand toys and clothes markets and other initiatives. And with a finalised
centre she will be able to generate additional income as it can be rented out
for informal education activities and social gatherings. </p>
<p><b>What is hippotherapy?</b></p>
<p>Hippotherapy is a physical,
occupational or speech therapy treatment strategy that utilises equine movement
as part of an integrated treatment program to achieve functional
outcomes.  In hippotherapy - which is named after the Greek word for
horse, “hippo” - the patient engages in activities on the horse that are
enjoyable, challenging and effective.</p>
<p><b>What are the benefits?</b></p>
<p>Benefits of hippotherapy
include improvements in balance, muscle strength, gait, posture and
symmetry, joint mobility, sensory processing and motor planning.  In
addition, this therapy is far removed from a clinic or hospital setting
and comes with the rich sensory and emotional aspects of the horse and
beautiful farm setting.</p><p><b>The story behind the picture</b></p><p>Nada is 14 years old and was born with

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We are two Italian women, mother and daughter, with a passion for traveling and a strong ethics for diversity. Being travelers ourselves, we have always privileged small and unknown destinations, unstepped routes, and out of season sceneries, <i>far from the madding crowd</i>. We like to feel and taste one remote location, rather than running through a dozen must-see places. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Through our lives, we ended up researching the negative effects of mass tourism: the illusion of economic growth, which results in social oppression and the exploitation of local resources to the advantage of few corporate industries; the reciprocal stereotyping and false perceptions created between the nations involved; the trivialization of cultural and traditional values; and last but not least, global pollution.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Meanwhile we kept on traveling around the world in a different way, and we have found out how fulfilling and magic it can be. We call it Slow Travel. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">A new way of traveling, where time becomes the key to open the doors of a reality you have yet to explore. Easiness is the rhythm of your steps. You want to see less, but deeper. You search the authenticity of the culture you approach. You follow hundred-years old paths. Meet the people, taste their home food, learn their jokes. Sit at the kitchen table of a country grandma, who teaches you her cooking secrets. Join the village celebrations and feasts. Discover the small and hidden jewels of the surroundings, led by local guides who have spent their lifetimes there.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We want to stay away from the predictable routes of mainstream tour packages, to explore instead unusual destinations, unknown even to most Italians. We want to take you where time seems to have stopped centuries ago, wondering through uncontaminated villages <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">and lands. We want to give you the chance to discover and love a still unspoiled nature. We want you to experience the difference between looking at a country through a window glass, and living it from the inside.</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In other words, the difference between being a tourist and a traveler…</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Our project naturally converges in the <a href=""http://www.slowfood.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Slow Food</a> movement, with which we share principles and values: sustainability and harmony with nature, a commitment the communities and the environment, and awareness of our global responsibility towards the rest of the planet. <br/></p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Partnerning uniquely with LGBTQ positive establishments, we have designed a one-of-a-kind itinerary in the heart of Tuscan Maremma. Following our Slow Travel mandate, we will stay out of big cities and common tourist destinations. We will instead explore ancient and remote villages, taste the superb eno-gastronomic gems of these areas, and learn about some of the untold stories that these lands conceal.</p>

</div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">We are also happy to launch women-only tours, leading you through the small streets of tiny medieval towns and remote rural villages of the Tuscan Apennines. You may want to endeavor a culinary experience, tasting the true flavors of home-made Italian cuisine, and mastering its secrets. Or you may enjoy spotting row-deers in the early morning, visiting the lively weekly market of Tuscan villages, or gathering wild herbs and learning how to use them. You are welcome to find your womenly way to Italy….<br/>
</div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">Following the path of archaic/prehistoric female-based societies, and retracing the steps of historical female writers, poetesses, philosophers, mystics, and scientists, we are excited to lead you through a totally out-of-the-ordinary, time-travel experience. Join us and honor with us the lives and works of female talents sometimes underestimated even today, because of their gender. Discover the forgotten stories and unknown places that have shaped the lives of unique women, and marvel at the precious heritage that they have generously left us with. Sit in the presence of these ancient women’s everlasting mark, feel the power of their strength and determination, untangle the mysteries of their interwoven existences.<br/>
</div><div style=""text-align: justify;"">Whether you come with your daughters or sisters, friends or lovers, or whether you bring just yourself, this trip is open to women-only and to all who identify on the female spectrum.<br/>
</div><h3><br/></h3><h3>The Italian Dream </h3><div style=""text-align: center;"">
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">We intend to specialize in two types of Slow Travel: <i>Culinary Experiences</i>, and <i>Cultural Trips</i>. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">CULINARY EXPERIENCES - we offer you the unique opportunity to taste the real dishes of Italian cuisine, and to learn its secrets and delicacies attending our cooking classes, held by local, life-long experienced home-cooks. These sessions are space-out by daily walking excursions into the wild and yet unspoiled surrounding nature, and visits to enchanting little villages and and forgotten towns of the gorgeous Tuscan Apennines. We can also visit the nearby<em>  Bordona Organic Cheese Factory</em>, walk along its stables, see how cheese is made and enjoy a unique cheese tasting experience.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">CULTURAL TRIPS - Italy is a country with a history thousands years-old, preserving an incredible abundance of rests of the past, archeological remains, and traces of great men and women, scattered all over the territory. Our trips are a way to discover and appreciate some of these precious jewels, including war and peace, art and literature, ancient crafts and herbal mastery itineraries. </p>

We offer daily excursions, spaced out by our cooking classes, held by local, life-long experienced home-cooks, and  culminating with the yearly enogastronomic and artisan feast Meeting of the Senses.

<i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We start from the archeological site of Monte Bibele, a prehistorical village dating back to the 6th century B.C. Habitations, small streets, a sacred space dedicated to the Mother Goddess and 2 cemeteries are the remaining signs of a community able to peacefully merge both Celtic and Etruscans components, a touching example of ancient  tolerance and equality.</i><br/>
</div>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>Then we follow the determination of our Roman predecessors, who paved their way towards the South of the Italian peninsula on  a 192 km long line, known as theFlaminia Minor. Some parts of this legendary route are still visible today, and we can literally walk on footsteps over two thousands years old.<br/></i></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>The area has also bore witness to several internationally renown figures in the realm of womanhood. We start with Christine de Pizan, born in 1364, who owes her name to Pizzano, a small village on the Tosco-Emiliano Apennine. Christine was a prolific author, who left forty-one surviving poetic works and a number of prose books, most of which are also available in English. She was popular and respected in all Europe and left an influential footprint in the otherwise male-dominated literary field of the time.<br/></i></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>Moving around in this territory, a few centuries later we find another woman who reached the peaks of popularity. Born in 1711, Laura Bassi was the first woman in Europe to earn a professorship in physics at the University of Bologna, in her hometown, and she became one of the most estimated scientist of 19th century. Despite the many challenges of the time, she used to travel by carriage along the Tuscan hills for her scientific experiments. Today, a 31 km crater on Venus honors her name.<br/></i></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>Last but not least, is Sibilla Aleramo, worldwide known feminist and writer, whose passionate and adventurous life included romances with both men and women. One of her partners was the distinguished poet Dino Campana, born in 1885 inMarradi, a small Tuscan village on the Romagnolo Apennine. We retrace the path of this troubled and deep-felt love, that eventually led the poet to insanity.</i><br/></p>

The famous Gothic Line crossed the Region from the East to the West coast, touching at some extent almost every town and village of these hills. We offer the opportunity of visiting the battle sites, listing to the survivors’ stories, understanding and honoring the sacrifice of the many who offered their lives for the freedom of others. In a country like Italy where history is one of the main components of most tourist packages, Slow Travel also means encouraging the remembrance and rediscovery of some of its forgotten heroes and heroines.</i><br/>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>Our base-location is Palazzuolo sul Senio, on the hills of the Tuscan Apennines. Our itinerary touches the site of Ca’ Malanca, where, in October 1944, two battalions of the famous Garibaldi Brigade partisans confronted the German army in order to brake the Gothic Line and reach the English and Indian forces, a few kilometers away. Although many victims, after three days of  harsh battles, the partisan were finally able to unite with the Liberation Army. Today, on the place of the battle there is a museum, with a rich collection of documents, photographs and objects of the war. A walking excursion following the partisan trail, retraces some of the places of the fierce conflict between German soldiers and Italian rebels.</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><i>Another milestone of the tragic events of the Second World War in Italy, is Monte Battaglia (Battle Mount), the destiny of which seems linked to the battlefield since time immemorial: its name is derived from ancient crashes between barbarian clans during the 6th century A.D. However, it is again in September 1944 that the site became theatre of a ferocious battle where the American soldier and the partisans of Garibaldi Brigade confronted side by side against the Germans, and eventually defeated them. More then two thousand men died on that spot.</i></p>

Most of them have been, since then, abandoned.

It accommodates the bodies of 30.683 german soldiers and officials. The contrast between the breath-taking view from the top of the hill and the impressive amounts of the graves, opens minds and hearts to the absurdity and the insanity of any war.

</div></div>","Why Slow Travel?
We are two Italian women, mother and daughter, with a passion for traveling and a strong ethics for diversity. Being travelers ourselves, we have always privileged small and unknown destinations, unstepped routes, and out of season sceneries, far from the madding crowd. We like to feel and taste one remote location, rather than running through a dozen must-see places. 
Through our lives, we ended up researching the negative effects of mass tourism: the illusion of economic growth, which results in social oppression and the exploitation of local resources to the advantage of few corporate industries; the reciprocal stereotyping and false perceptions created between the nations involved; the trivialization of cultural and traditional values; and last but not least, global pollution.
Meanwhile we kept on traveling around the world in a different way, and we have found out how fulfilling and magic it can be. We call it Slow Travel. A new way of traveling, where time becomes the key to open the doors of a reality you have yet to explore. Easiness is the rhythm of your steps. You want to see less, but deeper. You search the authenticity of the culture you approach. You follow hundred-years old paths. Meet the people, taste their home food, learn their jokes. Sit at the kitchen table of a country grandma, who teaches you her cooking secrets. Join the village celebrations and feasts. Discover the small and hidden jewels of the surroundings, led by local guides who have spent their lifetimes there.
We want to stay away from the predictable routes of mainstream tour packages, to explore instead unusual destinations, unknown even to most Italians. We want to take you where time seems to have stopped centuries ago, wondering through uncontaminated villages and lands. We want to give you the chance to discover and love a still unspoiled nature. We want you to experience the difference between looking at a country through a window glass, and living it from the inside.
In other words, the difference between being a tourist and a traveler…
Our project naturally converges in the Slow Food movement, with which we share principles and values: sustainability and harmony with nature, a commitment the communities and the environment, and awareness of our global responsibility towards the rest of the planet. 




LGBTQ and Women-only

All are welcome to join our trips, which promote diversity of race, faith, sexuality, and gender expressions of all kinds. 
We are proud to offer LGBTQ itineraries, with the desire of sharing and encouraging the discovery of less known tales, places, and figures of Italian queer history and presence.
Partnerning uniquely with LGBTQ positive establishments, we have designed a one-of-a-kind itinerary in the heart of Tuscan Maremma. Following our Slow Travel mandate, we will stay out of big cities and common tourist destinations. We will instead explore ancient and remote villages, taste the superb eno-gastronomic gems of these areas, and learn about some of the untold stories that these lands conceal.


We are also happy to launch women-only tours, leading you through the small streets of tiny medieval towns and remote rural villages of the Tuscan Apennines. You may want to endeavor a culinary experience, tasting the true flavors of home-made Italian cuisine, and mastering its secrets. Or you may enjoy spotting row-deers in the early morning, visiting the lively weekly market of Tuscan villages, or gathering wild herbs and learning how to use them. You are welcome to find your womenly way to Italy….
Following the path of archaic/prehistoric female-based societies, and retracing the steps of historical female writers, poetesses, philosophers, mystics, and scientists, we are excited to lead you through a totally out-of-the-ordinary, time-travel experience. Join us and honor with us the lives and works of female talents sometimes underestimated even today, because of their gender. Discover the forgotten stories and unknown places that have shaped the lives of unique women, and marvel at the precious heritage that they have generously left us with. Sit in the presence of these ancient women’s everlasting mark, feel the power of their strength and determination, untangle the mysteries of their interwoven existences.
Whether you come with your daughters or sisters, friends or lovers, or whether you bring just yourself, this trip is open to women-only and to all who identify on the female spectrum.
The Italian Dream 
We intend to specialize in two types of Slow Travel: Culinary Experiences, and Cultural Trips. 
CULINARY EXPERIENCES - we offer you the unique opportunity to taste the real dishes of Italian cuisine, and to learn its secrets and delicacies attending our cooking classes, held by local, life-long experienced home-cooks. These sessions are space-out by daily walking excursions into the wild and yet unspoiled surrounding nature, and visits to enchanting little villages and and forgotten towns of the gorgeous Tuscan Apennines. We can also visit the nearby  Bordona Organic Cheese Factory, walk along its stables, see how cheese is made and enjoy a unique cheese tasting experience.



CULTURAL TRIPS - Italy is a country with a history thousands years-old, preserving an incredible abundance of rests of the past, archeological remains, and traces of great men and women, scattered all over the territory. Our trips are a way to discover and appreciate some of these precious jewels, including war and peace, art and literature, ancient crafts and herbal mastery itineraries. 

All details are already available on our site: http://theitaliandream-slowtravel.com


Here are just three, brief samples of our Italian Dreams...

Meeting the Senses







One week in the tiny medieval village of Piancaldoli, in the heart of Tuscany. We offer daily excursions, spaced out by our cooking classes, held by local, life-long experienced home-cooks, and  culminating with the yearly enogastronomic and artisan feast Meeting of the Senses. Under the lights of a starry sky, this itinerary will take you through the secret allies of the village in search of the authentic flavors of the regional tradition.

For the veg*ans, we also have a whole week dedicated to the vegetable world. Chasing, gathering, following and discovering all kind of plants and their miraculous properties. First, in The Garden of Herbs of Casola Valsenio, a unique museum where 450 species of herbs are cultivated, and where we can experience and learn the secrets of the millennial art of herbal medicine.
Then, guided by local and passionate experts, we can venture in the wild ourselves in search for spontaneous mushrooms and other edible  veg* goodies.
And finally, Signora Teresa’s fabulous cooking classes, where we can learn how to prepare delicious vegetarian Italian dishes.

Ancient Paths and Extraordinary Women






We start from the archeological site of Monte Bibele, a prehistorical village dating back to the 6th century B.C. Habitations, small streets, a sacred space dedicated to the Mother Goddess and 2 cemeteries are the remaining signs of a community able to peacefully merge both Celtic and Etruscans components, a touching example of ancient  tolerance and equality.

Then we follow the determination of our Roman predecessors, who paved their way towards the South of the Italian peninsula on  a 192 km long line, known as theFlaminia Minor. Some parts of this legendary route are still visible today, and we can literally walk on footsteps over two thousands years old.

Christine was a prolific author, who left forty-one surviving poetic works and a number of prose books, most of which are also available in English. She was popular and respected in all Europe and left an influential footprint in the otherwise male-dominated literary field of the time.
Moving around in this territory, a few centuries later we find another woman who reached the peaks of popularity. Born in 1711, Laura Bassi was the first woman in Europe to earn a professorship in physics at the University of Bologna, in her hometown, and she became one of the most estimated scientist of 19th century. Despite the many challenges of the time, she used to travel by carriage along the Tuscan hills for her scientific experiments. Today, a 31 km crater on Venus honors her name.
Last but not least, is Sibilla Aleramo, worldwide known feminist and writer, whose passionate and adventurous life included romances with both men and women. One of her partners was the distinguished poet Dino Campana, born in 1885 inMarradi, a small Tuscan village on the Romagnolo Apennine. We retrace the path of this troubled and deep-felt love, that eventually led the poet to insanity.

War and Peace




During World War II the Italian Apennines have been the stage of the long lasting confrontation between the German army on one side, the American troops on the other, and the partisans in between. The famous Gothic Line crossed the Region from the East to the West coast, touching at some extent almost every town and village of these hills. We offer the opportunity of visiting the battle sites, listing to the survivors’ stories, understanding and honoring the sacrifice of the many who offered their lives for the freedom of others. In a country like Italy where history is one of the main components of most tourist packages, Slow Travel also means encouraging the remembrance and rediscovery of some of its forgotten heroes and heroines.


Our base-location is Palazzuolo sul Senio, on the hills of the Tuscan Apennines. Our itinerary touches the site of Ca’ Malanca, where, in October 1944, two battalions of the famous Garibaldi Brigade partisans confronted the German army in order to brake the Gothic Line and reach the English and Indian forces, a few kilometers away. Although many victims, after three days of  harsh battles, the partisan were finally able to unite with the Liberation Army. Today, on the place of the battle there is a museum, with a rich collection of documents, photographs and objects of the war.

More then two thousand men died on that spot.



A must-go destination for our Remembrance Tour is the historical park of Monte Sole, where one of the worst massacres of World War II took place.

Most of them have been, since then, abandoned. Monte Sole, with its striking and excruciating emptiness, surrounded by the mute beauty of the Emilian Apennines, has become a sacred pilgrimage to all who believe the importance of remembering the innocent victims of wars’ brutality.

Why do we love it so much?  It

<p>We’ve done some pretty incredible
things because of what we believe in.  We
can start with why we both changed our last name to preserve the legacy of
Louis Bromfield.  You can read about it
here: <a href=""http://goo.gl/1zkjrh"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://goo.gl/1zkjrh</span></a> </p>
<p>We discovered this coffee on a trip
and said that it was the most incredible coffee that we’ve ever had.  It has that “something” that’s makes it the
best.  That something is called Fairtrade
and the flavor comes from the love that’s put into each hand-pick bean.  </p>
<p>Fairtrade means that workers get
decent working conditions; farmers get a fair price for their beans which will
never fall lower than the market price, and they don’t use forced labor.  It addresses the needs of the farmers and
creates a greater economic and environmental sustainability.  </p>
<p>That sounds like a good thing
right?  Absolutely!</p>
<p>Aren’t there other Fairtrade coffee
companies out there that do this?  Yes,
but…</p>
<p>What makes Puro any different than
the rest? They’re the <b>ONLY</b> coffee
company that gives a percentage of their sales to the World Land Trust to buy
and protect at-risk areas of the rainforest.

coffee is grown by small farmers or plantation workers, who are meticulous
about their business and highly attentive to their crop. They have grown up
with their forefathers teaching them the tricks and trades of the industry
enabling them to become agricultural masters. They talk passionately about
their beans, their way of life, and their families and their passion and care
can be tasted in every cup of Puro.</p>
<p><b>Organic certification</b>
helps to ensure that coffee is grown in the way that nature intended. No
artificial fertilizers or chemical agents, crop rotation and weeding by hand.
It also encourages the composting of all waste to create organic means of
adding nutrients back into the soil.</p>
<p><b>Shade Grown</b>
coffee encourages the preservation of trees native to the area or re-planting
of trees that once stood on the land to provide this essential shade. This is
great for biodiversity and helps enable growing coffee in harmony with the
environment.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453390013/bq4h2c5t2ngysxkqwyla.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453390140/pl7mxcmqsfcg1fh14bnq.png"" src="""" style=""width: 620px; height: 354px;""/></p><p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">For more about their coffee, visit: </b><a href=""http://www.purocoffee.com/us/our-coffee"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>www.purocoffee.com/us/our-coffee</b></a></p>

<p>When we first had the coffee, we
asked “Where can we find the coffee we had at breakfast?”  We were told that you could get it
online.  Sounds simple, everything is
online these days.  When we got home, we
got home and saw this:</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453391024/jwh6ryiaictbjtok9hux.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Not cool!</p>
<p>We wrote Miko, (the Belgian based company
that has been roasting coffee since 1801), and asked what we needed to do to be
a US distributor.  We’re shocked that
someone didn’t do it first &amp; we found out why pretty quick why it wasn’t done
sooner.  Who wants to deal with the Department
of Agriculture, Customs and Border Patrol protocols, import brokers and FDA food
registered warehouses every time they want coffee?  We do! 
Yes, the coffee is that great!</p>
<p>(Come on, where’s the pitch??)</p>
<p>After several weeks of communication
between Puro and ourselves, they agreed that we could be their US Distributor... but we’d need to start in Ohio!  </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Yes we can get the coffee!  Wait, what??</span><br/></p>
<p>That’s right, we can begin
distribution in Ohio, but we can’t be their <b>only</b> US distributor.  They
want people out there reading this to be distributors in their state; therefore we
are currently limited to sales in Ohio.  After
this campaign is over, you’ll need to work with those agencies to get the
coffee.</p>
<p>Before you click back on your
browser, read this: <b>They are allowing us

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Anyone, Anywhere!</h3>
<p>Why should I contribute if you can’t
sell me their coffee to me after this campaign? 
Good question!</p>
<p>The majority of the perks in the campaign
come with a built in <b>discount of 20% off all future orders</b>! 
 </p>
<p>Last time, where’s the pitch?</p>
<p>We understand that it’s difficult to
take someone’s words about the coffee without actually trying it first.  Unless you’re familiar with the brand, you’d
need to sample it first before buying it. 
It’s a pretty tough sell.  You can
take our word its awesome or you can go online and check out what bloggers have
said about it.</p>
<p>To get the word out, we placed a
small order and the picture at the top shows you what we
ordered.  We know we needed to sample the
coffee in order to really sell it.  We
took the coffee to family events, private gatherings and at public events.  It went over well, especially at the fairtrade
event at our church.  We took many names,
email addresses and soon people started to pre-order and give us money to begin our journey.  We put that money aside and continued to talk
about the coffee to the businesses that we would visit.  What happened next would change the course of
our campaign.</p>
<p>As of 1/21/16, we have arrangements
from at least 4 coffee shops to carry the coffee (and some who want to sell it in their coffee shop), a couple of restaurants, one Bed and Breakfast, and a winery.  The pre-orders, coupled with the amount that they have committed to is <b>enough to make it happen! </b> </p>
<p>To fulfill the orders given to us, we placed an order for a larger delivery (see pictures below).  We even ordered T-shirts to wear when we go
around to various businesses.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453390435/ieamogkbyupbaoxd5pvq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453390458/sy4vh76qyx6pxwy53vd5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1453390247/wbi7xoe6mjbmyxvdihdj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b><span>It’s going to happen, regardless of

Who are we and why are we doing this?
Our names are CJ & Wendy
Bromfield and before you is Puro coffee. 
Why do we love it so much?  It
tastes amazing and there isn’t a coffee that we’ve had that compares to it!  
We’ve done some pretty incredible
things because of what we believe in.  We
can start with why we both changed our last name to preserve the legacy of
Louis Bromfield.  You can read about it
here: http://goo.gl/1zkjrh 
We discovered this coffee on a trip
and said that it was the most incredible coffee that we’ve ever had.  It has that “something” that’s makes it the
best.  That something is called Fairtrade
and the flavor comes from the love that’s put into each hand-pick bean.  
Fairtrade means that workers get
decent working conditions; farmers get a fair price for their beans which will
never fall lower than the market price, and they don’t use forced labor.  It addresses the needs of the farmers and
creates a greater economic and environmental sustainability.  
That sounds like a good thing
right?  Absolutely!
Aren’t there other Fairtrade coffee
companies out there that do this?  Yes,
but…
What makes Puro any different than
the rest? They’re the ONLY coffee
company that gives a percentage of their sales to the World Land Trust to buy
and protect at-risk areas of the rainforest. 
How many coffee companies can say
that?  None!  To date, Puro has helped purchase and protect
over 14,000 acres of rainforest.  In
addition to this, they have started programs such as trees4schools, where they
empower children by teaching them about planting trees, best agriculture practices
and self-sustainability.  You can read
about it here: www.trees4schools.org/about.aspx or watch a video here: https://vimeo.com/31084630

are a group of young people from Bosnia and Herzegovina who are involved in
some NGO's in Sarajevo, and who wants to make traveling much easier and much
cheaper for students from our country so that they get the same possibility to
travel and see the world like their friends from other parts in Europe. We also
are enthusiastic believers in the WORK AND TRAVEL program, and we also intend
to help young people to earn money while traveling.</p>
<p><b>WHY ARE WE DO THAT?</b> In
the last 25 years our country went through heavy times. In the beginning of the
nineties a huge war broke out, and most of the country’s economy broke down.
People lose their jobs and later even life’s. Most of today's students were
born at the time and didn't have the possibility to grow up as their friends in
the rest of Europe. About 80% of the young people in Bosnia and Herzegovina
didn't travel abroad or more than 200 kilometers from their home. We want to
give same opportunities and we want to help young people to travel Europe and
the World as cheap and easy as possible.</p>
<p><b>HOW DO WE DO THAT?</b> By
organizing bigger groups we intend to lower the price as low as possible, and
to give the best service for a fair price. Our guideline is clear! We believe
that no trip inside Europe need to be more than 199€ (240US$) and this idea
will help us to create new products and give more possibilities to our client’s
so that they will also be part of our whole planning process.</p>
<p><b>WHAT IS OUR VISION?</b> Our
vision is to start small and grow step by step, so that every year we will have
at least 3000 costumers that will participate in our trips and learn the
culture of Europe. We also plan to rise the number of young people participate
in the Work and Travel program in USA, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Our
goal is that 500 young people from Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia and
Montenegro use the possibility and travel in this far locations to work, learn
and travel.</p>
<p><b>WHERE WE WILL SPEND THE MONEY THAT WE WILL RAISE?</b> The money that we will raise we will initial use to register
our company as an Ltd. And to pay initial costs of starting the company (Rentals,
equipment, renovation etc.). We also plan to use 30% of the money for marketing
costs, so that our company and our products get visibility and that our popularity
can grow.</p>
<p><b>WHAT ARE WE OFFER YOU?</b> If
you support our aim, we will use the possibility to thank you in a special way!
We will have a WALL OF SUPPOERTERS’ in our agency where everyone who will
donate more than <b>5 USD</b> get its
picture and its name there. Every of our future customers will know who supported
this idea and helped us start business! Everyone who donate more than <b>10 USD </b>will additionally to the wall of

<p><b>Butterfly Transition House</b></p>
<br/><p>This world is not an easy place to live in when you identify as a transgender or transsexual individual. Though the media is making the public more aware and acceptance is more socially prevalent, there is still bias in this world, and general society just doesn’t know how to interact with someone who is transitioning from one gender identity to another. Butterfly Transition House aims to create a place where that difficulty does not exist. The Butterfly Transition House is a location where a transgender or transsexual individual is offered the opportunity to enjoy their transition, from the beginning of their experience to a point where they can be comfortable in public, by providing transition assistance and a comfortable living atmosphere. There are many aspects that would make Butterfly Transition House the optimal place to begin or continue your transition from a male identity to a female identity, ranging from an educated staff to a comfortable living quarters, with life lessons and leisure time in-between. </p>
<p>As a transgender or transsexual individual, you begin life with a gender assigned at birth, but through life experience you come to realize that the gender you were assigned does not align with who you truly are as a person. Many transgender or transsexual individuals go through life adhering to gender roles that pertain to the gender that they have been assigned, and miss out on a lot of the learning experiences that someone of the opposite gender experience through their lives. For example, though a boy may grow long hair through their life to more closely identify with their feminine side, many of them don’t know anything about feminine hairstyles or how to maintain them. This would be one of the many things that a client of Butterfly Transition House would be able to learn about, to ease their transition, and bring them closer to womanhood. </p>
<p>A key feature of this house would be the clientele themselves. Some people may suggest that you spend time with and familiarize yourself with people that are the gender you identify with, but it isn’t really that simple. Even if someone of that gender is open minded, they will never go through many of the experiences a transgender or transsexual individual goes through. Thus it is hard to share your struggles as a transgender or transsexual individual with someone that isn’t transgender or transsexual, simply because they can’t relate, which is understandable.Only approximately one in ten thousand people identify as transgender or transsexual. Because everyone in the house would be going through a similar experience, they would be able to bond, and build new life experiences and friendships that could last a lifetime. Getting so many like minded people in one place could really build a great support system, on top of that which would be offered by the house itself.</p>
<p>Butterfly Transition House is a place where someone could not only begin their physical transition, but their life transition. The house offers education in cooking, fashion, cosmetics, and other aspects of ladyhood. There is likely be 1 to 2 staff members dedicated specifically to these subjects. There is at least one optional group offered in one subject per day. The house isn’t all work and no fun, however. There are various ways to spend the days in leisure, ranging from playing video games, to watching tv or movies, to playing various sports, to lounging by or in the swimming pool. Each client also learns about being independent. The living situation is set up so that there are two clients to each room, that they are responsible for maintaining. Each room is checked twice a week to make sure it is being well kept. Each room also offers amenities ranging from a full length vanity mirror for hair, makeup, and choosing outfits, to a cable ready tv that the clients can share. Though they are able to do their own grocery shopping, each client is responsible for preparing their own food, or sharing food with other clients. This is another aspect that helps build independence. Each client is also responsible for cleaning their own clothing, and there is the shared duty of washing the dishes and trash duty. </p>
<p>Transitioning genders is not an easy thing to do in this world on your own, or even with a support system, as that support system might not have the necessary facilities to accommodate this period in someone’s life to make it as comfortable as possible. Because the transgender or transsexual population is gaining more exposure through the media, there are not only more people aware of transgender or transsexual individuals, but more individuals that identify as transgender or transsexual themselves, looking for answers about how to begin their transition. There is a niche market available with a growing clientele due to this fact. Butterfly Transition House fills this position, and is a project that establishes itself at the ground floor of what is sure to be an ever expanding industry. </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Setup</p>
<br/><p>  The main facility for this venture will be the house itself. I am most interested in acquiring a motel or apartment complex that has a pool and room for social interaction. The city we will be located in depends on pricing of premises we are interested in and how liberal the city itself is. Does the city have an active and accepting lgbt population? I am also interested in the social life of the city. Are there places where the girls can go out once they feel comfortable? We should also look for a location that is in close approximation to somewhere that the girls can get essentials like food; ideally in reasonable walking distance, though we should offer transportation at times and for specific circumstances. </p>
<p>  The management systems shouldn’t be too difficult or complex. A pc on location with an external hard drive for information backup should suffice. The house manager should be able to do simple maintenance on the web page and basic record keeping. All financial matters should be handled by a financial manager.</p>  We will also need to set up relations with professionals in the medical fields, those being specifically a therapist and endocrinologist. If insurance covers certain aspects, we may also be able to have a house therapist on staff. I do not know much about how much medical insurance will cover and for what, but if we move forward, we can do more research into this area. It may prove to be a large part of how housing expenses can be covered, in a manor similar to those that are in intensive outpatient treatment at halfway houses.<br/> <p></p>
<p>Initial Investments</p>
<p>  Property- Motel Property -         between $375,000 and $750,000</p>
<p>  Renovations-   between $10,000 and $20,000 (depending on status of property)</p>
<p>Electronics- TV’s, Computers, Internet, Cable, Phone -      $8,500  </p>
<p>  Furniture- Couches, Dressers, Beds, Furnishings, etc -      $10,000</p>
<p>  Webpage Design-                $1,500</p>
<p>  Marketing and Advertising- Google AdWords and Community Interaction  $1,000</p>
<p>Personnel first paychecks- </p>
<p>Manager -             $2,800</p>
<p>Finance Manager -            $6,000</p>
<p>Educator -                 $300 </p>
<p>Utilities-                    $400</p>
<p>  Insurance-                   $1,000</p>
<br/>Estimated Total =              between $420,800 and $795,800<br/><br/>If we don't meet our goal or raise enough to open a facility, a large portion of the money would be donated to charities and individuals who are in need of funding for transition.<br/><ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>What Qualifies Me?</h3>
<p>I am a transgender woman who has not been able to begin transition myself for multiple reasons. One of the main reasons is that I haven't had a place where I could feel comfortable beginning this life changing adventure. I know what someone in my position would like to have available, and I plan to provide that.</p>

Many transgender or transsexual individuals go through life adhering to gender roles that pertain to the gender that they have been assigned, and miss out on a lot of the learning experiences that someone of the opposite gender experience through their lives. For example, though a boy may grow long hair through their life to more closely identify with their feminine side, many of them don’t know anything about feminine hairstyles or how to maintain them. This would be one of the many things that a client of Butterfly Transition House would be able to learn about, to ease their transition, and bring them closer to womanhood. 
A key feature of this house would be the clientele themselves. Some people may suggest that you spend time with and familiarize yourself with people that are the gender you identify with, but it isn’t really that simple. Even if someone of that gender is open minded, they will never go through many of the experiences a transgender or transsexual individual goes through. Thus it is hard to share your struggles as a transgender or transsexual individual with someone that isn’t transgender or transsexual, simply because they can’t relate, which is understandable.Only approximately one in ten thousand people identify as transgender or transsexual. Because everyone in the house would be going through a similar experience, they would be able to bond, and build new life experiences and friendships that could last a lifetime. Getting so many like minded people in one place could really build a great support system, on top of that which would be offered by the house itself.
Butterfly Transition House is a place where someone could not only begin their physical transition, but their life transition. The house offers education in cooking, fashion, cosmetics, and other aspects of ladyhood. There is likely be 1 to 2 staff members dedicated specifically to these subjects. There is at least one optional group offered in one subject per day. The house isn’t all work and no fun, however. There are various ways to spend the days in leisure, ranging from playing video games, to watching tv or movies, to playing various sports, to lounging by or in the swimming pool. Each client also learns about being independent. The living situation is set up so that there are two clients to each room, that they are responsible for maintaining. Each room is checked twice a week to make sure it is being well kept. Each room also offers amenities ranging from a full length vanity mirror for hair, makeup, and choosing outfits, to a cable ready tv that the clients can share. Though they are able to do their own grocery shopping, each client is responsible for preparing their own food, or sharing food with other clients. This is another aspect that helps build independence. Each client is also responsible for cleaning their own clothing, and there is the shared duty of washing the dishes and trash duty. 
Transitioning genders is not an easy thing to do in this world on your own, or even with a support system, as that support system might not have the necessary facilities to accommodate this period in someone’s life to make it as comfortable as possible. Because the transgender or transsexual population is gaining more exposure through the media, there are not only more people aware of transgender or transsexual individuals, but more individuals that identify as transgender or transsexual themselves, looking for answers about how to begin their transition. There is a niche market available with a growing clientele due to this fact. Butterfly Transition House fills this position, and is a project that establishes itself at the ground floor of what is sure to be an ever expanding industry. 
   What We Need

Setup
  The main facility for this venture will be the house itself. I am most interested in acquiring a motel or apartment complex that has a pool and room for social interaction. The city we will be located in depends on pricing of premises we are interested in and how liberal the city itself is. Does the city have an active and accepting lgbt population? I am also interested in the social life of the city. Are there places where the girls can go out once they feel comfortable? We should also look for a location that is in close approximation to somewhere that the girls can get essentials like food; ideally in reasonable walking distance, though we should offer transportation at times and for specific circumstances. 
  The management systems shouldn’t be too difficult or complex. A pc on location with an external hard drive for information backup should suffice. The house manager should be able to do simple maintenance on the web page and basic record keeping. All financial matters should be handled by a financial manager.  We will also need to set up relations with professionals in the medical fields, those being specifically a therapist and endocrinologist. If insurance covers certain aspects, we may also be able to have a house therapist on staff. I do not know much about how much medical insurance will cover and for what, but if we move forward, we can do more research into this area. It may prove to be a large part of how housing expenses can be covered, in a manor similar to those that are in intensive outpatient treatment at halfway houses. 
Initial Investments
  Property- Motel Property -         between $375,000 and $750,000
  Renovations-   between $10,000 and $20,000 (depending on status of property)
Electronics- TV’s, Computers, Internet, Cable, Phone -      $8,500  
  Furniture- Couches, Dressers, Beds, Furnishings, etc -      $10,000
  Webpage Design-                $1,500
  Marketing and Advertising- Google AdWords and Community Interaction  $1,000
Personnel first paychecks- 
Manager -             $2,800
Finance Manager -            $6,000
Educator -                 $300 
Utilities-                    $400
  Insurance-                   $1,000
Estimated Total =              between $420,800 and $795,800If we don't meet our goal or raise enough to open a facility, a large portion of the money would be donated to charities and individuals who are in need of funding for transition.   What Qualifies Me?
I am a transgender woman who has not been able to begin transition myself for multiple reasons. One of the main reasons is that I haven't had a place where I could feel comfortable beginning this life changing adventure. I know what someone in my position would like to have available, and I plan to provide that.

<br/>WHAT IS THE KRYO° HOPSULATOR™?</h1><p>Great question! The HOPSULATOR™ is a 16oz, stainless-steel, double wall, vacuum-insulated, can-insulator. Don't know what any of that means? Let me explain. </p><p>The stainless steel inner wall prevents heat transfer by radiation. In our can-insulator, there is a small space between the inner stainless wall and the outer stainless wall that is vacuum sealed with a bottom piece that is attached inside a vacuum chamber. The goal is to get the vacuum-chamber as empty as possible - without atoms, conduction and convection cannot take place. This vacuum prevents heat transfer from the outside-in and vice-versa by convection, this means there will be zero condensation and almost no temperature change to the outer wall of the stainless making it easy to carry ice-cold drinks. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455952056/g3iyfprnqrjj9lyddcan.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455556159/ul0f6rgqze8vvi6lmmpr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455953235/exaftiegdwz4y8u3ink7.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><br/><h1>BENEFITS OF THE HOPSULATOR™: </h1><ul>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Pondaseta Brewing Co. consists of brewers and owners Kaleb West and Trever Martin. About 10 years ago we each started exploring homebrewing and the craft beer scene. After much learning, many mistakes and a lot of ""taste testing"", this hobby soon became a passion. After living away from the Texas Panhandle for the past 13 years, we decided to come home to Canyon, Texas and make our brewery dreams come true. We have been planning and working hard to perfect our recipes for the past year and can't wait to bring our beer to the Texas Panhandle!</p>
<p>Our goal with this campaign is to raise funds to help pay for a beer canning line. Having this equipment will allow us to can and package our beers in-house. We are confident this will increase our distribution to craft beer lovers and help our brewery make a statement in Amarillo's growing craft beer scene. </p>
<p>Our contributors will help us achieve the ability to build our brand further than we could by only selling pours in our taproom. Having our canned beer available ""to-go"" at our brewery will broaden and strengthen our clientele and spread the Pondaseta name across the region. And when we're ready to distribute to package stores, restaurants, and convenience stores, the in-house canning line will make that a possible. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>With this campaign we are set to raise $20,000. This will give us the funds to order the ""Yampa Canning Line"" from Twin Monkeys, a company located in Aurora, Colorado. This line will allow us to package around 18 cans per minute with one operator.                 </li>
<li>We think you will love our perks! We will offer unique can pint glasses, t-shirts, hoodies, and caps with our Pondaseta logo. These items will be exclusive to this campaign and not sold in the brewery. Other awesome perks include personalized brewers shirts with your name, brewing in-house with us, and even naming our stainless tanks where all the brewery visitors can see! We will also display the names of all contributors in the brewery.  </li>
<li>All contributors will be invited to a special ""Sneak Peak"" at the brewery prior to opening.</li>
<li>Some Perks include a small shipping charge. We're happy to send your items anywhere in the U.S. If you would rather pick your items up from us in Amarillo, we'll include a free growler fill token in place of the shipping.</li>
<li>We need YOU to help us reach our goal. But just in case we don't, that's OK. We will apply the funds we do raise towards the canning line and go ahead and order that bad boy!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Canning beer is not a new concept and is definitely becoming the preferred method of packaging in the craft beer community. In cans, beer stays fresher longer by protecting the beer from light, is easier to transport commercially and distribute, and the aluminum is nearly infinitely recyclable. Many parks and recreation areas do not allow glass containers, so with craft beer in cans you can take it nearly anywhere. Wouldn't it be awesome to take some Pondaseta Premium to the lake, or a sixer of I-40 IPA camping? We think so!</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We are very excited for everyone to be a part of our brewery and this campaign. We could not be successful without you. We know not everyone can contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help. Spread the word about Pondaseta to your family, friends, and everyone you can. Share the Indiegogo link, on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and anyway you can. Good news travels fast!</p>

<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Proper Job is a community run, not for profit, recycling centre based in Chagford, Devon. They need to raise 5k for a purpose built vehicle with a customised logo. This new van is necessary to enable them to carry on providing a service through out rural Devon, as their old van has to be recycled itself! This important service keeps large items of household waste away from the landfill.  It will also be used to deliver home made organic compost and has the potential to be used by local people as a community vehicle.</span><br/>
</div><div>
<p>At Proper Job, recyclable items are broken down to their component parts and recycled separately. Reusable items are given a second lease of life - they are kept away from landfill by being offered for sale in an Aladdin’s cave of pre-loved treasures at a fraction of their original cost. Our customers not only save money, they help save the environment!  Without a new van, a lot of these easily reusable or recyclable items could end up in landfill.  With a new van, Proper Job would aim to double the collections they are currently able to do.  There is a growing network of community driven projects, some just composting, some just doing reuse, others involved in growing and selling local produce and many more, but there are none quite like Proper Job.  In fact, for many organisations, Proper Job stands as a beacon to show how it can be done.</p>
<p>It all started in Chagford in 1993 when a group of allotment holders launched a community composting project.  They wanted to recycle green waste and create a local recycling facility for other items.  All were committed to principles of recycling and environmental sustainability. The rural skip service was being filled up with many reusable/recyclable and compostable items and the nearest recycling centre was 15 miles away. The group started their activities around these skips that came to the village each month by taking out or diverting all the green waste. </p>
<p>Proper Job Limited was set up in 1995, describing itself as “a community business committed to principles of sustainability and helping to create jobs”.   This was included in a broader development plan, which encompassed a holistic vision embracing the concept of healthy community achieved through the principles of community involvement and participation, with recycling as a central feature.

SUMMARY

Proper Job is a community run, not for profit, recycling centre based in Chagford, Devon. They need to raise 5k for a purpose built vehicle with a customised logo. This new van is necessary to enable them to carry on providing a service through out rural Devon, as their old van has to be recycled itself! This important service keeps large items of household waste away from the landfill.  It will also be used to deliver home made organic compost and has the potential to be used by local people as a community vehicle.

At Proper Job, recyclable items are broken down to their component parts and recycled separately. Reusable items are given a second lease of life - they are kept away from landfill by being offered for sale in an Aladdin’s cave of pre-loved treasures at a fraction of their original cost. Our customers not only save money, they help save the environment!  Without a new van, a lot of these easily reusable or recyclable items could end up in landfill.  With a new van, Proper Job would aim to double the collections they are currently able to do.  There is a growing network of community driven projects, some just composting, some just doing reuse, others involved in growing and selling local produce and many more, but there are none quite like Proper Job.  In fact, for many organisations, Proper Job stands as a beacon to show how it can be done.
It all started in Chagford in 1993 when a group of allotment holders launched a community composting project.  They wanted to recycle green waste and create a local recycling facility for other items.  All were committed to principles of recycling and environmental sustainability. The rural skip service was being filled up with many reusable/recyclable and compostable items and the nearest recycling centre was 15 miles away. The group started their activities around these skips that came to the village each month by taking out or diverting all the green waste. 
Proper Job Limited was set up in 1995, describing itself as “a community business committed to principles of sustainability and helping to create jobs”.   This was included in a broader development plan, which encompassed a holistic vision embracing the concept of healthy community achieved through the principles of community involvement and participation, with recycling as a central feature. 

WHAT THEY NEED
They need 5k to buy a second  hand  modified vehicle with a customised logo.  A second hand Nissan Cabstar will cost just over £3000 and with modifications including a box and tail lift it will cost just over £5000    
A box conversion is necessary so that when deliveries and cardboard are transported, they don't get wet and damaged, and a tail lift is essential for transporting heavy goods such as Rayburns.
Proper Job relies on people using their recycling services and shopping at the resource centre for most of its income.  With a sign-written van, the good work they do would be far more visible to the wider community.
PERKS
There are some great rewards on offer in return for donating money to Proper Job, including Vouchers, Artisan Bread Making Courses, Compost Making Workshops, Cheese Making Tuition and much more still to come! 
RISKS AND CHALLENGES
With any form of crowd funding, there is always the risk that the target won't be achieved.  Over the years, the amount of money available to support recycling organisations such as ours has got smaller and smaller and so Proper Job has become adept at fundraising for small amounts here and there.  However, the current van won't last more than a few months so the money for a replacement is needed now.

<p><i>""Since childhood, I have loved to experiment with
food. Growing up in the resort town of Sun Valley, Idaho, gave me space to be
creative. I preferred to create something new rather than follow someone else's recipe. As a teenager, I was lucky enough to have a friend that taught me about the important relationship between nutrition and good health. Later, as a parent, I worked hard to create the healthiest, most nutrient dense foods, in hopes of having a positive impact on my child's health.
<br/><br/>
I developed my 'Ketchum Kale Chips' during the summer
of 2011. Farmer's Market customers loved them, so I expanded into stores. Then I came up with a vegetable medley I called 'Veggie Evolution'. Both types of snacks are a healthy and delicious alternative to fried potato chips.<br/></i></p><p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/700794/files/20140707170846-IMG_6675_small.jpg?1404778126"" src="""" style=""""/></i></p><i>

This all started because I wanted to show people that snacking can be both healthy and great tasting.  I also had a desire to be able to use the business as a way to share profits with worthy non-profit groups.
<br/><br/>
My dream is becoming a reality, both showing more people that eating vegetables can be convenient and fun and to give back to groups like The Hunger Coalition, Owl House Preschool and the Flourish Foundation.
<br/><br/>
Thank you to my loyal customers for keeping me
very inspired, always giving me feedback, and helping me remember to keep it
fun!""</i>

I purchased my first bag of your Kale chips today at our Pilgrims market in Coeur d'Alene... I just love this product. I have seen other kale chips on the market, looked at the ingredients and put them back..yours are the real deal! Great ingredients... great taste. I have always wanted to eat kale, but until eating your chips, I just could not stand the taste of it. The nutritional benefits of kale are impressive and now I can enjoy them. Thanks Sheila for being a top-notch food entrepreneur.. by making a food that you would eat yourself, you stand out from 99% of the rest.<br/>

Best to you,<br/>

Hi,<br/>
I saw your Veggie Evolution products at the Pearl Street Whole Foods in Boulder today for the first time. Although I've been disappointed by kale chips and similar products in the past (I now usually make my own), I decided to pick up a couple bags (barbecue and lemon parmesan). We had the barbecue flavor with our lunch, and I have to say ""Wow!"" -- these were the tastiest veggie chips we've ever had.  Better still, they are one of the few organic offerings, and they are low on the glycemic scale.  I'm sold.
We liked them so much I am tempted to drive back to WFM (on a busy Friday afternoon, that's saying something) to get more before anyone else buys them up. I will definitely be supporting your products.<br/>
best wishes,<br/>

My dream is becoming a reality, both showing more people that eating vegetables can be convenient and fun and to give back to groups like The Hunger Coalition, Owl House Preschool and the Flourish Foundation.

Thank you to my loyal customers for keeping me
very inspired, always giving me feedback, and helping me remember to keep it
fun!""

WHAT OUR FANS ARE SAYING

Hello,
I purchased my first bag of your Kale chips today at our Pilgrims market in Coeur d'Alene... I just love this product. I have seen other kale chips on the market, looked at the ingredients and put them back..yours are the real deal! Great ingredients... great taste. I have always wanted to eat kale, but until eating your chips, I just could not stand the taste of it. The nutritional benefits of kale are impressive and now I can enjoy them. Thanks Sheila for being a top-notch food entrepreneur.. by making a food that you would eat yourself, you stand out from 99% of the rest.

Best to you,
Mary Jo

Hello,
I wanted to tell you how much of a fan I am of your products. The Veggie Evolution Chips I had for the first time last night blew me away. The flavors are incredible and the way you achieve the depth of flavor with so few ingredients is impressive.
Keep up the tasty work.

Sheila,
When I saw kale chips from Hailey, I immediately bought them out of gratitude for that special place. They were delicious. Now I am a true patron. I buy them all the time. I even special order them so I know I can eat them when I need to. I eat about one small bag of ""Almost Naked"" every day. I applaud your entrepreneur spirit. Wish I could do the same. 
Best wishes on the journey ahead.

Respectfully,
Brenda

Sheila,
I tried your Ketchum Kale Chips from the Boise Co-op and found them excellent.  I tried competing brands as well, but I liked the taste of yours and the lower levels of fats, etc., relative to some of the others.  (I also like supporting locals such as your firm.)
Thanks!

Hi,
I saw your Veggie Evolution products at the Pearl Street Whole Foods in Boulder today for the first time. Although I've been disappointed by kale chips and similar products in the past (I now usually make my own), I decided to pick up a couple bags (barbecue and lemon parmesan). We had the barbecue flavor with our lunch, and I have to say ""Wow!"" -- these were the tastiest veggie chips we've ever had.  Better still, they are one of the few organic offerings, and they are low on the glycemic scale.  I'm sold.
We liked them so much I am tempted to drive back to WFM (on a busy Friday afternoon, that's saying something) to get more before anyone else buys them up. I will definitely be supporting your products.
best wishes,
Arlene

</b><div>
<p></p>
<p>Thanks for checking out our project!  We’ve invented a product that firefighters tell
us will save lives, and you can help get it into their hands!  </p>
<p>Every year, firefighters are injured or 
killed because they can’t find their way out of smoky buildings. We’re
committed to this product because we don’t want a single firefighter to perish
because he or she became disoriented in a rescue situation and ran out of
oxygen. This no longer has to happen; firefighters don't have to die while
trying to save people like you and me...you can help make the difference! Over
the last few years we have met with Search &amp; Rescue teams and firefighter
focus groups around the country, soliciting their input on design and function,
to help us develop the best possible search tool. <b>The ""Tracer Line"" is the result
of that collaboration.</b>
 The Tracer Line is truly
created by firefighters, for firefighters.<span> 
</span></p>
<p>The Tracer
Line has now been demoed and beta tested by hundreds of firefighters across the
U.S. with outstanding feedback.<span>  </span>We have a highly respected manufacturer ready to assemble and
produce the Tracer Line in the United States.<span> 
We’re ready to go!  We just need
your help.  Let’s help our firefighters
get out, alive!</span></p>
<p><b>What is it?</b></p>
<p>The Tracer Line is a
retractable search line that will help firefighters find their way out of
smoke-filled buildings quickly and efficiently.<span> 
The unit </span>attaches to the rescuer's
belt, is hands-free, can prop open entry doors without a chock, and provides
the firefighter a physical attachment to the outside that will exit with him as
s/he goes.  The line is made of a revolutionary material that is 1/3 as
thick as traditional rope lines, making it much smaller and lighter while still
being extremely strong and heat-resistant. As it is retractable, it
doesn't tangle behind the user and can be used immediately again and again.</p>

<p><b>What method do firefighters currently use?<span>  </span></b></p>
<p>The traditional method of
searching is to carry in a rope bag, tie off one end, and play out the line as
the building is entered. When the search
is complete, the firefighter follows the line back out of the smoke to safety. While
this standard process has been used for many years, it has some inherent
problems. Rope bags are bulky, and
managing them requires the use of at least one hand.<span>  As a rescuer retreats back out of a building,
the line loops behind him/her and may become tangled on furniture or
debris.  A rope bag is only good for one
search area because it takes too long to repack. Due to these drawbacks,
many firefighters don't use their rope bags, which puts their lives at risk,
unnecessarily.  In these situations, time
is a matter of life or death. </span></p>
<p><b>So, how do these two tools compare?</b></p>

<span><p style=""text-align: center;""></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>How
do you know the Tracer Line will be successful?</b></p>
<p>The Tracer Line was designed with the input of over
one hundred firefighters who participated in focus groups sessions from the
early prototype stage to the finished product stage.<span>  It addresses all the limitations posed by
older rope bags that have caused firefighters to leave them on the rig in the
past…firefighters will use the Tracer Line and it will save lives!  The Tracer Line has been demoed and beta

</p><p><b>By playing a small part you will have the opportunity to change 
the world, no picketing, no rioting is required, other than financing a

project objective is very simple. Finance is required to patent in the 
United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions a revolutionary invention
 that is truly a life change event in itself. </p><p><b>Catch 22</b></p><p>European,
 and for most parts of the world public disclosure of an invention 
constitutes invalidity to patent the invention in the first place, 
therefore no disclosure in given here.</p><p><b>Acquiring Patents</b></p><p>By
 acquiring patents in multiple jurisdictions, inventor will then 
disclose to parties of interest the invention.  First the US 
jurisdiction, then Europe, and if funding permits other countries.</p><p><b>Marketing</b></p><p>Once
 patenting process, filling, acquiring filling receipts for patent 
application then disclosure commences. The inventor then will disclose 
to organizations the invention. More than likely parties of interest 
will want interest of some kind because their need is greater than the 
inventor's.</p><p><b>Disclosure to backers</b></p><p>Once patent 
applications receipts are obtain backers will be notify about the 
invention. A website with a countdown clock will be sent to backers, and
 entities who can make use of it.</p><p><b>Inventor reason</b></p><p>The
 main reason is for the interest of Polar Bear's and all species of the 
planet, including those in the oceans. Various organizations around the 
planet are fighting a loosing battle in trying to protect endanger, 
threaten, and vulnerable species, but they are loosing the battle.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/862711/files/20140916191025-Polar_Bear_Female_with_Young.jpg?1410919825"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Credit: USFWS, Photo: Susanne Miller<div>

<p><b>Birds have no lawyers</b></p>
<p>Recently, found out about this 
organization that is a true believer for birds, they made a report about
 more than 300+ birds are in the brink of going the way of the 
dinosaurs. Unfortunately, it is a horrendous battle nowadays every 
organization needs money, event the ones with all the good intentions.</p>
<p>What
 if money was the last thing they would need. You never know, maybe by 
using this invention the last thing we'll have to worry about is over 
population of every specie of bird.</p>

<h1><b><i>NOW THE CHALLENGE</i></b></h1>
<p>The inventor will seek patent protection through a process known as Patent Acceleration from The United States Patent Office  (<a href=""http://www.uspto.gov/patents/process/file/accelerated/index.jsp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.uspto.gov/patents/process/file/accelerated/index.jsp</a>)
 a Petition to make Special is a request by an inventor or 
representative as a request to accelerate the patent application only 
under certain conditions. They involve the age of the inventor(s), if 
the invention merits accelerated review.</p>

By playing a small part you will have the opportunity to change 
the world, no picketing, no rioting is required, other than financing a 
rewarding challenge. Project ObjectiveThe 
project objective is very simple. Finance is required to patent in the 
United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions a revolutionary invention
 that is truly a life change event in itself. Catch 22European,
 and for most parts of the world public disclosure of an invention 
constitutes invalidity to patent the invention in the first place, 
therefore no disclosure in given here.Acquiring PatentsBy
 acquiring patents in multiple jurisdictions, inventor will then 
disclose to parties of interest the invention.  First the US 
jurisdiction, then Europe, and if funding permits other countries.MarketingOnce
 patenting process, filling, acquiring filling receipts for patent 
application then disclosure commences. The inventor then will disclose 
to organizations the invention. More than likely parties of interest 
will want interest of some kind because their need is greater than the 
inventor's.Disclosure to backersOnce patent 
applications receipts are obtain backers will be notify about the 
invention. A website with a countdown clock will be sent to backers, and
 entities who can make use of it.Inventor reasonThe
 main reason is for the interest of Polar Bear's and all species of the 
planet, including those in the oceans. Various organizations around the 
planet are fighting a loosing battle in trying to protect endanger, 
threaten, and vulnerable species, but they are loosing the battle.Credit: USFWS, Photo: Susanne Miller


Our climate
We already know that the temperature of our
 planet is changing and no one is immune. Climate models, graphs made by
 scientists show how it has become apparent.  The public graph made by 
the US Government NOAA exemplifies this fact.



NOAA Climate Dashboard - Climate Projection

Birds have no lawyers
Recently, found out about this 
organization that is a true believer for birds, they made a report about
 more than 300+ birds are in the brink of going the way of the 
dinosaurs. Unfortunately, it is a horrendous battle nowadays every 
organization needs money, event the ones with all the good intentions.
What
 if money was the last thing they would need. You never know, maybe by 
using this invention the last thing we'll have to worry about is over 
population of every specie of bird.

Not a Save the Whale's Campaign
Remember this is not
 an invention for birds, or polar bears, but not until it is put in 
place, the fruits of our labor will come slowly or gradually. If this 
request is funded, and a patent or patents given, then will the parties 
of interest will more than likely want to make use of the invention.

NOW THE CHALLENGE
The inventor will seek patent protection through a process known as Patent Acceleration from The United States Patent Office  (http://www.uspto.gov/patents/process/file/accelerated/index.jsp)
 a Petition to make Special is a request by an inventor or 
representative as a request to accelerate the patent application only 
under certain conditions. They involve the age of the inventor(s), if 
the invention merits accelerated review.


Application Flow
When merits, and required application documents, fees, processing is 
accepted for review The United States Patent Office will give the 
application special attention.The challenge is to obtain a patent in 12 
months, the sooner the better. Under these provisions, the application 
then therefore has the opportunity to apply for foreign patents. 
Once,
 then a patent in the European Patent Office, and the World Intellectual Property Organization is then filed. Under WIPO an applicant can then 
apply to several countries.


Secrecy
Secrecy is 
paramount, no information of what one has, or explain what it is devote 
by the patent offices. Soon after, under application rules the 
application is then publish to the world to see. Only under publication 
will then the patent details are known.
The Marketing
Marketing
 lets people know what's out there before they can navigate the maze 
that each patent database is. Marketing will then be conducted through a
 website with video, pictures, and details.




If a party becomes interested then everything is done through 
lawyers, for example, licensing. Companies already exist that would wish
 they make use of the invention. This invention may not be for sale, 
unless for the real grand prize.

<p><b></b></p>INTRODUCTION
<p><b>Hi
this is Rebekah Pruchnic and Patrick McCormick. We are asking for
crowdfunding donations towards an RV to travel in for our Quantum
Road Trips in the amount of $100,000 for the RV, plus an additional
$200,000 for the mobile virtual broadcast global uplink studio that
it will house. All funding which exceeds those amounts will go
towards our $10 million 'spill-over campaign' for start-up capital
whereby we begin creating large-scale production studio designed to
create a film studio which will make spiritual-thriller movies,
telling important messages to humanity for its ascension.</b></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>WHAT
ARE QUANTUM ROAD TRIPS?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Our
Quantum Road Trips consist of traveling to various cities in North
America. They involve live Broadcasts, Retreats, Profound Healing
Experiences, and various Energy Therapies being taught in different
locations. This includes doing energy work to lift the h</b><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">eavy density
which has collected in cert</b><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">ain cities, to lighten them. This also
includes group and private sessions. All of this includes very high
Divine energy. Currently we are traveling and doing a series of live
broadcasts in local areas of the US, called the The Greater Work
Series.</b></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>WHAT
IS IN STORE WITH HUMANITY?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Why
the need for collective and personal energy work? Humanity is about
to take a huge leap forward in consciousness, and many lightworkers
have been seeded with high frequencies of light to aid humanity in
this process. Our normal (carbon-based) bodies are about to undergo a
huge metamorphosis. It is necessary to prepare for the hugh infusions
of light energy now entering our world from the cosmos. We are
activating the Light Workers so that they can fulfill their roles in
holding these higher frequencies for humanity, to stabilize its
evolution into a higher dimension.</b></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>WHO
ARE WE, AND WHAT HAPPENS?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>We
both have amazing backrounds in working with Quantum Energy. These
result in intuitive, mystical, psychic, teaching, channeling,
multidimensional and healing gifts that unfold during these events.
As Kartron, an inter-dimensional from the realms of essence,
transmits through Patrick McCormick, and Sole, a Dominion Solar Angel
transmits through Rebekah Pruchnic, various Inter-dimensional,
Angelic and Light Beings assist in amplifying the light energies they
bring through to Earth. It is quite an experience that can change
lives forever.</b></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>HOW
CAN THIS HAPPEN?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Some
of these life-altering processes are called Cellular Memory Healing
and the 'Soul Touch' used by Rebekah and Sole', and the God Gate,
Pillar of Transformation and the Still Point created by Kartron to
simplify the divine energy in our lives, and many more. Cellular
memory healing removes energy blockages, which are very common as we
navigate through life.  Common causes of energy blockages are
physical and emotional trauma, illness, surgery, suppressed feelings,
starvation, fear, stress and karma.  Stored energy blocks can create
disease.  
</b></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>WHAT
IS CELLULAR MEMORY?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Cellular
memory healing clears and heals many imprints, such as guilt,
distrust, heartache and betrayal, fear, struggle, resentment, and
many others.  Just ONE session can clear issues that one could spend
years and years trying to resolve in traditional therapy.  It clears
trapped energy out of the organs and gets the issues out of your
tissues.  It also works with the “Soul Star” which is an energy
center above the head that contains much information and the entire
blueprint for our Soul's Mission. When these areas are blocked we can
have life setbacks, be unclear about our purpose, and even have
physical illness result. It also restructures the DNA from a 2-strand
to 12-strand.</b></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>SOUL
TOUCH – AN ANGEL'S GIFT</b></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Using
the Cellular Memory process as a foundation, Soul Touch takes it to
inter dimensional levels across time, activating the 13-strand DNA
helix. This becomes the Foundation Template for our Crystalline Light
Bodies, which will be necesssary if we are to stay on planet earth in
the near future. The reason for this is that as our planet ascends to
higher dimensions, it will hold a much higher frequency of light. 
The old structure is Carbon based, the new one will be Crystalline
which will enable a human body to hold these higher light frequencies
and also enables one to have much better health due to more light and
life force in the DNA and cells.  
</b></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>WHY
DO WE DO THIS?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Like
many on this planet, it is our Destiny to Change the World. So many
people are burdened with life's challenges, keeping them busy.
Fulfilling one's Purpose is one of the boldest paths we can take. It
is the bravest who dare to live their Destiny. That is why we were
created. It is the essence which fills the Soul, gives Nourishment to
the Spirit, and Purpose to the Path.</b></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>If
you could make a difference in the world, making someone's life
better, would you? We are preparing a vehicle to help millions of
people improve their lives, enlighten their paths, and raise the
quality of life for the many who choose it. This is not just a dream,
it is a reality. That is what you do by supporting our campaign; you
are the change you want to see in the world.</b></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>In
addition, your support of our campaign, helping us to achieve the
RV-Mobile Broadcast Studio travel life mobilizes our Quantum Road
Tour into magnificent proportions, which enables us to give an event
in your city. The Live Broadcast technology in our virtual studios
can be set up anywhere we may set up a tech connection, linking up to
the world.</b></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Do
you have a dream? Are you ready to live it? Are you ready to have us
broadcast it out to the world?</b></p>
<p><b>That
is what you support by supporting us; a chance to change the world.</b></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>WHY
THIS WORK MUST CONTINUE</b></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>So
we find it very very important to continue on with this work, which
is our purpose for being here at this time.  It has changed many many
lives and helped many with various health issues, spiritual issues,
and soothes and heals many traumas.  After just one session a person
can expect to feel very peaceful, lighter, and have an overall sense
of well being and heavenly bliss. Many report being able to connect
to their guardian angels, guides, Ascended masters such as Jesus, St.
Germain and Mother Mary, and have a profound reconnection with the
Divine. Most feel inspired and many report feeling a Profound sense
of Love and Freedom, as this work is very powerful. So we are asking
for your most generous and heartfelt donations with this Campaign,
and to do so will help many to touch Heaven.</b></p><p><b><b>Thank You, Rebekah and Patrick.</b><br/></b></p><p><b></b></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1116076/files/20141225011924-Greater_Work_Series_12-21-14_Joining_Galactic_Society.jpg?1419499163"" src="""" style=""width: 614.926724137931px; height: 797px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1116078/files/20141225012443-Greater_Work_Series_12-19-14_The_Awakening_Light_Body.jpg?1419499483"" src="""" style=""width: 617.589803012746px; height: 987px;""/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1116080/files/20141225012805-Greater_Work_Series_12-17-14_The_Paradigm_of_Prophecy.jpg?1419499685"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1116082/files/20141225013153-Greater_Work_Series_12-12-14_Portals_of_Destiny.jpg?1419499913"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1116083/files/20141225013312-Greater_Work_Series_12-10-14_Restoring_Divine_Mind.jpg?1419499992"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1116084/files/20141225013419-Greater_Work_Series_12-3-14_Correcting_Time.jpg?1419500059"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1116085/files/20141225013449-Greater_Work_Series_11-26-14_States_of_Grace.jpg?1419500089"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1116086/files/20141225013534-Greater_Work_Series_11-19-14_Matrix_of_Genesis.jpg?1419500134"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1116087/files/20141225013624-Greater_Work_Series_11-12-14_Regenesys_Awakening_the_God_Code.jpg?1419500184"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1116088/files/20141225013717-Greater_Work_Series_11-8-14_Clearing_Collective_Soul.jpg?1419500237"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

children by the end of 2015 and to place 12 next year. Your donation will give
me the funds I need to help expecting birthmothers and adoptive families now as we work to complete families
through adoption.

<div>
<div>After traveling for a year abroad, we're ending our travels by hiking amongst the worlds greatest giants, the Himalayas. We'll be volunteering in small village communities and schools along the way with hopes of helping to create a positive change and contribute to the people we meet. You can help too. With even a small contribution, these communities will see great change and improvements. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>All proceeds will go to Hope Alliance, an Australian non-profit that has partnered with a small village in Nepal. Read more about their specific projects or how to sponsor a child here:  <a href=""http://hopealliance.org.au"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://hopealliance.org.au</a><br/>
</div>
<div>Why help? We'd like this hike to be about more than just our experience, but about an effort by our own community to help another. We'll be volunteering our time to help however we can: teaching, building infrastructure, health, and other community services. Their needs are basic. Some Nepali villages have to walk two hours to get fresh water. Every penny you choose to give will go straight to causes like this. Where pencils and paint are a true gift. Mortar and bricks, a treasured commodity. </div>
