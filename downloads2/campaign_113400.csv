<p>We're 1/4 funded and our artist, Michael Manning, has been revealed! You can check out some of his preliminary sketches over at the <a href=""http://postmortemstudios.wordpress.com/2014/08/30/gorean-chronicles-art-by-michael-manning/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">BLOG</a>.</p>

<p><b>UPDATE 2</b></p>
<p>There's two common issues being raised:</p>
<p>1. I'm painfully aware that people don't like flexible funding. I've used it before, however, and delivered. This is my third, personal, crowdfunded project. Of the previous two one was flexible funding and one was not.</p>
<p>I have chosen flexible funding because I want this project to go ahead whatever happens. The books are already written. The money being raised here is explicitly for art, layout, additional editing and to help - financially - those who have or are contributing to the project.</p>
<p>2. Yes, I really do have the license for the project negotiated with Mr Norman's agent and his publishing company. I hold the license for the core books and to release adventures and supplementary material for a number of years following publication. Obviously I'm not going to make contract details public but yes, I hold a negotiated contract signed, sealed and delivered to do this.</p>

<h3>Gorean Chronicles</h3> <p>Despite great popularity, spanning nearly fifty years, the Gorean Cycle, by John Norman has existed without much greater recognition in the broader culture. It's high time it got some of the recognition it deserved in the form of a tabletop role-playing game and a definitive guide to the world of Gor.</p>

<p><b>Me</b></p>
<p>I am James 'Grim' Desborough, I've been a fan of the Gorean Cycle for over 20 years and a <a href=""http://postmortemstudios.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">professional role-playing game designer</a> for 15 years. I also <a href=""http://talesofgrim.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">write science fiction, fantasy and erotica</a> stories and have been featured in several anthologies as well as publishing my own work.</p>
<p><b>The Campaign</b></p>
<p>Gor deserves to be treated with the respect and affection that it's thousands upon thousands of fans regard it with. The books are written, but to make it from words on a page to a proper book funding is needed to give the books the degree of presentation and polish they deserve.</p>
<p><b>What We'll Achieve</b></p>
<p>Many different groups have done a fantastic job in creating Gorean worlds on IRC, WebChat pages and in Second Life but there has never been a definitive, common resource upon which every fan can draw or a set of role-playing rules that everyone could agree on or hold in common. With these two books we can provide a guide to the World of Gor and a common point of reference for a huge and sprawling community as well as bringing a wonderful fantasy world to a whole new group of fans.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>To truly do the books justice we need a minimum of $5,000 USD, though $10,000 would be ideal. This will allow us to quite lavishly illustrate the books and extra money can provide additional art, layout and editing services to ensure that we end up with a pair of books as a lasting resource for both the role-playing and Gorean communities.</p> <ul>
<li>We need $5,000 if the books are to be illustrated in a unified and defining manner by a single artist - who will be named later. I want to define Gor with art in the way Brom did for <a href=""http://web.tiscalinet.it/ffantasy/brom2.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.bromart.com/gallery.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dark Sun</a> or Diterlizzi did for <a href=""http://diterlizzi.com/home/games-gallery/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Planescape</a>.</li> <li>What perks can we offer? At the moment, early access to electronic versions of the books (PDF) when ready and the opportunity to be immortalised in the pages of the book - in one way or another. Additional perks and stretch goals may be forthcoming as the campaign continues.</li> <li>If we don't reach the goal, the contributed money will go towards artwork anyway, to do the best job possible. </li>
<li>If we go over our goal the excess money will go to more art, layout, editing and to further compensating the contributors, helping to support writers, artists, layout designers and editors - all of whom often work on a shoestring budget.</li> </ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Impact</h3> <p>Creating a Gorean roleplaying game and worldbook will create a resource for fans of Gor and role-players of all kinds for years to come, hopefully another fifty years to come. I am devoted to making this project a reality, having already spent eighteen months researching the books, cross-referencing, extracting information and writing both the guide and the game rules.</p>
<p>I have successfully completed two RPG projects previously, ImagiNation - an RPG about depression and mental illness - and Machinations of the Space Princess, a science fantasy 'old school' game.</p>
<p>You'll be helping me make something great and I'm devoted to making it happen one way or another.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There's some risks and challenges to this project, not least of all because of the sexual content of the Gorean cycle and its perceived sexual politics. Let's go through a few of them...</p>
<p><b>Sexual Content</b></p>
<p>Yes, Gor contains sexual content of a BDSM, D/S nature. Given that this is a huge part of the reason that it is so popular and that we live in a world where <i>Fifty Shades of Grey</i> can sell 100 million copies and be mainstream, I don't see this being too much of an issue. Underneath all that Gor is a fantasy world in the Planetary Romance tradition of Edgar Rice Burrough's 'Barsoom' and similar works. Sex is optional and need not be explicit, but it is part of what makes Gor so unique. To ignore it would be to do the books a disservice. The RPG book will contain advice on how to handle these complications and the illustrations should be able to avoid the problems that international censorship rules can sometimes cause.</p>
<p><b>Sexual Politics</b></p>
<p>Gor's world is unashamedly (mostly) a patriarchal, male-dominated society. The current climate in SF&amp;F with regard to games is quite heated about depictions of race, gender and sexuality and Gor is bound to set off some rancorous argument.</p>
<p>It's a fantasy world. It's not real.</p>
<p><b>Personal Issues</b></p>
<p>I suffer from depression, bouts of which can knock me out for some time. The project is already some six months behind my original, projected schedule but all the work that I really need to do is now complete. My health should not further affect the schedule.</p>
<p><b>Negative Publicity</b></p>
<p>As noted above, discussion over representation and sex/gender issues in games are a hot topic. The revelation that a Gorean RPG has been developed is bound to cause ripples, scorn, recriminations and many, many heated blog posts.</p>
<p>It's all publicity, free publicity and hopefully these people will discover that the treatment in the book is not as terrible as they might have thought.</p>
<p><b>Existing Communities</b></p>
<p>There are many existing communities that role-play Gorean experiences and they have made their own decisions about cities, governments, laws, history, details and have played out their own story lines.</p>
<p>If working in gaming has taught me anything, it's that fanboys are never happy and that they always have their own ideas.</p>
<p>Reviewing some of the material, art and other creations that these communities have come up with hugely inspiring and I have nothing but respect for the fan community that has kept the Gorean Cycle going. </p>
<p>Nothing I am doing is intended to override or replace what they have done, but to provide a common point of reference and something for them to use.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Share! Tell people! I don't have direct communications with the Gorean communities around the internet, on the forums or in Second Life and I'm not about to join them just to spam them about the game. Spread the word!</p>
<p>Ask questions! I'll answer as best I can, as and when I can.</p>

February 11 - I've added the option to donate by PayPal.<div>
<br/>
<h1>Goal:</h1>
<p>To create and run a “club” for self-published authors (and their readers) to <strong><em>HELP EACH OTHER</em></strong> through a few specific, actionable ways  to boost the marketing, ranking, and sales of <strong>each other’s</strong> books.</p>
<p>This project – excuse me, this potentially <strong><em>life-changing</em></strong> project – is based on three simple ideas:</p>
<ol>
<li>As much work as it is to write a book, that’s the easy part: marketing it is hard, especially so for a new author.</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">It’s much easier to sell <u>someone else’s</u> new book than your own (“Buy me!  Buy me!” just </span><strong style=""background-color: initial;"">doesn’t</strong><span style=""background-color: initial;""> sit with people nearly as well as “Hey, this other writer’s book is pretty good!  Read it!  Give him a chance while the book is at a low introductory price!”)</span><br/>
</li>
<li>Sometimes the best way to help yourself is by helping someone else <i>first</i>.  <i>A rising tide lifts all boats!</i> </li>
</ol>
<p class=""rteindent1""><em>All of us indie writers (and readers!) <u>can</u> help each other.</em></p>
<h1>The Plan:</h1>
<h2>Part 1:</h2>
<p>A website that:</p>
<ol>
<li>  is much more than lists of books for sale;</li>
<li>  is primarily for fellow authors and secondarily for general readers (Reader Members will get a monthly email to promote book sales.);</li>
<li>  lists indie books at an INTRODUCTORY or SALE price of $0.99-$2.99 (higher priced books are welcome, too, but remember that the whole idea of this site is to BOOST sales);</li>
<li>  includes the first 5-10 pages of each book, the front cover, and the back cover blurb;</li>
<li>  allows users to sort by listing date and popularity (by Author Votes or Reader Votes) within genre;</li>
<li>  <u>maybe</u> has an Author Members’ feedback system similar to ebay’s (so Author Members can see which other authors are actively helping to sell books. (What do YOU think about this?  How could we make this work?  Seriously, let me know.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>(Right now you can see sample book listings on a partial mock-up of the site at</b> <a href=""http://www.indiebookboosters.club/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.IndieBookBoosters.club</a><b>.  Btw, the site's Reader Members form is functional - feel free to join us!)</b><br/></p>
<p>​(Question for you: which domain name should be used, IndieBookBoosters.<strong>CLUB </strong>or .<strong>COM</strong>?  Let me know!)</p>
<h2>Part 2:</h2>
<p><strong>The Key and Crucial Part:</strong> A membership of authors who actively promote <strong><u>each other’s</u></strong> books.  </p>
<p>Without active participation from the indie author community, this will turn out to be just another website advertising books at introductory prices (which is not a bad thing at all; it is not, however, a new idea.)  So, all you indie authors out there, this is what I define as active participation:</p>
<ol>
<li>Occasionally (monthly? bi-weekly?) buy a book (probably at an introductory or sale price of $0.99) from your fellow Author Members.  <i>Choose only those books that genuinely appeal to you.</i>
</li>
<li>Of these books, <u>when you read one you like</u>:
	<ul>
<li>  Write and post – <em><u>if you feel so inclined</u></em> - a short, <u>legitimate</u> review.</li>
<li>  Give the author a boost by letting everyone you know that the book <em>exists</em> and is available for an introductory or sale price of $0.99 - $2.99.  Ask them – if they get and read the book – <u>maybe</u> to post a review.  Use:
		<ul>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>Twitter</li>
<li>Your blog</li>
<li>Emails</li>
<li>Conversation</li>
<li>At the end of your ebook, <i>especially </i>if on a similar topic.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p class=""rteindent2"">None of these things will cost a penny, and it will create good karma for you.</p>
<p class=""rteindent2""><i>Even if this word-of-mouth publicity is limited to a single Facebook or Twitter post, it is nonetheless the kind of publicity you just cannot buy!</i></p>
<h2><strong>What if . . .</strong></h2>
<p>Just imagine . . . if every month every Author Member and some percentage of Reader Members gets just <u>one</u> ebook – <i><b>spending no more than the price of a single cup of coffee at a convenience store</b></i> – what could happen . . .</p>
<p><strong>. . . when we have 1,000 </strong>actively-participating Author Members . . . that will be:</p>
<ul>
<li> 1,000 sales</li>
<li> 1,000 Verified Purchase Reviews (<i>maybe</i>)</li>
<li> 1,000 Facebook posts</li>
<li> 1,000 Twitter posts</li>
<li> 1,000 blog posts</li>
<li> 1,000’s of mentions in emails and conversation</li>

<p><strong>Yes!  </strong>Here’s why:</p>
<p class=""rteindent1""><strong>Reason 1</strong>: There will be <u>no</u> requirement for any member (author or reader) to buy any specific book or any number of books.</p>
<p class=""rteindent1""><strong>Reason 2</strong>: Authors who are producing books that are ready for some level of success – good or great story, good or great writing, and good or great cover – will naturally, organically be the most popular.  Because members will easily be able to preview the first 5-10 pages of a book, view the front cover, read the back cover blurb, and even access the reviews already on Amazon and GoodReads, chances are they will choose books that they consider actually worth reading.</p>
<p class=""rteindent1""><strong>Reason 3</strong>: There will be <u>no</u> requirement or expectation for any member (author or reader) who buys a fellow member’s book to post an Amazon Review (a VPR) for that same book or author (or, actually, <em>any</em> other.)  Because of this, together with Reasons 1 and 2, the VPRs will be legitimate.</p>
<p class=""rteindent2""><strong>Note</strong>: Amazon’s rules do not allow authors to <u>buy</u> reviews, which makes simple sense.  The closest an author can get to that is to give someone a free copy and only ask – with no obligation – for it to be reviewed.</p>
<p class=""rteindent2"">Authors understand the value of both VPRs and their own name.  If they like a book enough to write a VPR and attach their name (even only their Amazon username), they will.  Or they won’t.  None of us feels the urge to write even a short review for <i>everything </i>we read, do we?</p>
<p class=""rteindent2"">That being said, still, all of us indie writers (and readers!) <u>can</u> help each other!  This site will be simply an efficient clearinghouse for emerging authors to meet each other and the public.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>It should be clear that this is not in any way a “guaranteed sales success package” for any book – all purchases and reviews are completely voluntary.  There is no “I’ll buy yours if you buy mine” agreement, explicit or implicit.</p>
<p>That’s pretty much it.</p>
<h2><strong>The cost to Author Members:</strong></h2>
<p>Originally I thought this should be a free service, but then I thought of all the free services I’ve signed up for and then soon forgot.  “Free” can often mean “forgettable,” whereas even a paltry investment of money tends to anchor emotion and participation.  So, if there’s a very small one-time listing fee per book, say $2 . . .</p>
<ul>
<li>Would the site get fewer Author Members? Most certainly.</li>
<li>Would the Author Members that do join, on average, be <i>demonstrably </i>more involved in this site?  Most certainly.</li>
<li>Would it give the site more working capital to start and build momentum?  Most certainly.</li>
<li>Would the listing fee rise as the site grows in popularity and value to the Author Members (and require more computer resources, customer service, email services for the Reader Members list, etc.)? “Maybe” to “probably” . . .</li>
</ul>
<p>(What do you think would work best overall? <b>Would $5 per listing work better?</b>  Or maybe $5 for membership (as an Author)?  Seriously, what do you think? Let me know.)</p>

<li>Web hosting (no way around it: this requires cash, and no, those $1 / month site packages you see advertised are not nearly adequate.)</li>
<li>Web programming - (this will require <em>somebody’s</em> time, and “time is money”)</li>
<li>General support from the Writing and Reading Community – a wonderfully coded website is worthless if nobody wants to use it. Show us and <strong>every other interested indie author</strong> that <i>you’ll </i>participate – <i>pledge something!</i>

</div></div>","Update:
February 11 - I've added the option to donate by PayPal.

Goal:
To create and run a “club” for self-published authors (and their readers) to HELP EACH OTHER through a few specific, actionable ways  to boost the marketing, ranking, and sales of each other’s books.
This project – excuse me, this potentially life-changing project – is based on three simple ideas:

As much work as it is to write a book, that’s the easy part: marketing it is hard, especially so for a new author.

It’s much easier to sell someone else’s new book than your own (“Buy me!  Buy me!” just doesn’t sit with people nearly as well as “Hey, this other writer’s book is pretty good!  Read it!  Give him a chance while the book is at a low introductory price!”)

Sometimes the best way to help yourself is by helping someone else first.  A rising tide lifts all boats! 

All of us indie writers (and readers!) can help each other.
The Plan:
Part 1:
A website that:

  is much more than lists of books for sale;
  is primarily for fellow authors and secondarily for general readers (Reader Members will get a monthly email to promote book sales.);
  lists indie books at an INTRODUCTORY or SALE price of $0.99-$2.99 (higher priced books are welcome, too, but remember that the whole idea of this site is to BOOST sales);
  includes the first 5-10 pages of each book, the front cover, and the back cover blurb;
  allows users to sort by listing date and popularity (by Author Votes or Reader Votes) within genre;
  maybe has an Author Members’ feedback system similar to ebay’s (so Author Members can see which other authors are actively helping to sell books. (What do YOU think about this?  How could we make this work?  Seriously, let me know.

(Right now you can see sample book listings on a partial mock-up of the site at www.IndieBookBoosters.club.  Btw, the site's Reader Members form is functional - feel free to join us!)
​(Question for you: which domain name should be used, IndieBookBoosters.CLUB or .COM?  Let me know!)
Part 2:
The Key and Crucial Part: A membership of authors who actively promote each other’s books.  
Without active participation from the indie author community, this will turn out to be just another website advertising books at introductory prices (which is not a bad thing at all; it is not, however, a new idea.)  So, all you indie authors out there, this is what I define as active participation:

Occasionally (monthly? bi-weekly?) buy a book (probably at an introductory or sale price of $0.99) from your fellow Author Members.  Choose only those books that genuinely appeal to you.

Of these books, when you read one you like:
	
  Write and post – if you feel so inclined - a short, legitimate review.
  Give the author a boost by letting everyone you know that the book exists and is available for an introductory or sale price of $0.99 - $2.99.  Ask them – if they get and read the book – maybe to post a review.  Use:
		
Facebook
Twitter
Your blog
Emails
Conversation
At the end of your ebook, especially if on a similar topic.





None of these things will cost a penny, and it will create good karma for you.
Even if this word-of-mouth publicity is limited to a single Facebook or Twitter post, it is nonetheless the kind of publicity you just cannot buy!
What if . . .
Just imagine . . . if every month every Author Member and some percentage of Reader Members gets just one ebook – spending no more than the price of a single cup of coffee at a convenience store – what could happen . . .
. . . when we have 1,000 actively-participating Author Members . . . that will be:

 1,000 sales
 1,000 Verified Purchase Reviews (maybe)
 1,000 Facebook posts
 1,000 Twitter posts
 1,000 blog posts
 1,000’s of mentions in emails and conversation

These sales, reviews, and “broadcasts” will most probably be unevenly distributed among the Author Membership.  That’s fine: some of our indie authors are going to get a definite boost, and the rest of us will get maybe just little bumps toward the top.  That’s fine because it is fair: the most appealing books, the books most ripe for success, deserve to benefit the most!
Think long-term, which, as an author, is the only safe bet.  If you get only 3 or 4 Verified Purchase Reviews per month, no, it will not help you skyrocket to sales success.  BUT, after about 12 of these months, you’ll have about 50 VPRs, and yes, that will help you sell more books at a better monthly rate.
and . . .
. . . when we have 5,000 actively-participating Author Members . . .
. . . when we have 10,000 actively-participating Author Members . . .
. . . when we have 25,000 actively-participating Author Members . . .
. . . when we have 50,000 actively-participating Author Members . . . that will be good for all of us and damn good for the most-ready-for-success of us.
Together we could make deserving books pretty much instant bestsellers.
Is this fair?
Yes!  Here’s why:
Reason 1: There will be no requirement for any member (author or reader) to buy any specific book or any number of books.
Reason 2: Authors who are producing books that are ready for some level of success – good or great story, good or great writing, and good or great cover – will naturally, organically be the most popular.  Because members will easily be able to preview the first 5-10 pages of a book, view the front cover, read the back cover blurb, and even access the reviews already on Amazon and GoodReads, chances are they will choose books that they consider actually worth reading.

That’s pretty much it.

<p><b>Haunted by his past. Hunted in the present. Uncertain what
is real. </b></p>
<p>Athson the Archer has seen things that aren't there
and suffered fits since being tragically orphaned as a child at the hands of
trolls and Kregen the wizard. When a strange will mentioning a mysterious bow comes into his
possession he's not sure it's real. But the trolls that soon pursue him
are all too real and dangerous. And what's worse, these raiders serve Kregen the wizard and his master, the hidden dragon, Magdronu who are responsible for the destruction of his childhood home. Soon after, Athson is drawn into a quest for the concealed Bow of Hart by the mystic Withling, Hastra, But Athson isn't always sure what's
real and who his enemies are. With the wizard Kregen and Magdronu, involved Athson must face not only frequent danger but his grasp on
reality and the reasons behind his tragic past.</p>

project to reality!</p><p>For an excerpt from chapter 1 please click go to <a href=""http://www.phsolomon.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.phsolomon.com</a> and click on the excerpt link under the campaign news to view the PDF file.</p>
<p><b>What
Is Needed &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Primary book needs: a final round of professional
     editing, cover artwork and formatting as a basic goal. </li>
<li>Secondary book needs to be addressed if surpassing
     funding goal: marketing (such as electronic autographs and screensaver)
     &amp; website upgrades (web hosting migration costs, artwork design
     consistent with book cover, etc.)</li>
<li>Supporters will receive a copy of the ebook and
     recognition in the book as a contributor. Higher level supporters will
     have the opportunity to vote on which cover design to use. Please see below
     for the rewards levels list.</li>
<li>If the project is partially funded the money will be used
     for professional editing and cover artwork, followed by formatting and
     then secondary needs listed above depending on how much is raised.</li>
</ul><p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>You can help bring a fantasy epic long in the making to     life. I was     once offered a contract for it by small publishing company but turned it     down due to several vague clauses in a non-negotiable contract. The book is already written and being well received by     my picky beta reader as well as having been professionally edited once     already.</p><p>Also, with the changes in the publishing industry supporters
     now have an opportunity to become more than readers, becoming
     decision-makers for the industry as well. This brings readers and authors
     closer. One of my rewards allows some supporters to have a say in the
     cover decision.</p>
<p><b>Risks
&amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>The risks are few since the book is
written, is being well received by the beta reader and has been professionally
edited previously.</p>
<ul>
<li>I've already scheduled to send the manuscript to the
     editor in August, while I am discussing artwork with illustrators now..</li>
</ul><p><b>Other
Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>Are you unable to contribute or not
a reader of fantasy books? That's fine you can still help me with this project
in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share this project with friends who like fantasy books</li>
<li>Follow me on my website, Twitter, Facebook &amp;
     Pinterest and share my project progress with your own followers.</li>
<li>You can also share this project directly by using the
     Indiegogo share tools!</li>

possession he's not sure it's real. But the trolls that soon pursue him
are all too real and dangerous. And what's worse, these raiders serve Kregen the wizard and his master, the hidden dragon, Magdronu who are responsible for the destruction of his childhood home. Soon after, Athson is drawn into a quest for the concealed Bow of Hart by the mystic Withling, Hastra, But Athson isn't always sure what's
real and who his enemies are. With the wizard Kregen and Magdronu, involved Athson must face not only frequent danger but his grasp on
reality and the reasons behind his tragic past.

What
Is Needed & What You Get

Primary book needs: a final round of professional
     editing, cover artwork and formatting as a basic goal. 
Secondary book needs to be addressed if surpassing
     funding goal: marketing (such as electronic autographs and screensaver)
     & website upgrades (web hosting migration costs, artwork design
     consistent with book cover, etc.)
Supporters will receive a copy of the ebook and
     recognition in the book as a contributor. Higher level supporters will
     have the opportunity to vote on which cover design to use. Please see below
     for the rewards levels list.
If the project is partially funded the money will be used
     for professional editing and cover artwork, followed by formatting and
     then secondary needs listed above depending on how much is raised.
The
Impact
You can help bring a fantasy epic long in the making to     life. I was     once offered a contract for it by small publishing company but turned it     down due to several vague clauses in a non-negotiable contract. The book is already written and being well received by     my picky beta reader as well as having been professionally edited once     already.Also, with the changes in the publishing industry supporters
     now have an opportunity to become more than readers, becoming
     decision-makers for the industry as well. This brings readers and authors
     closer. One of my rewards allows some supporters to have a say in the
     cover decision.
Risks
& Challenges
The risks are few since the book is
written, is being well received by the beta reader and has been professionally
edited previously.

I've already scheduled to send the manuscript to the
     editor in August, while I am discussing artwork with illustrators now..

</p><h3></h3><p>Dear Friends and Family,</p><p>For some time now, I’ve known that God has called me to something far greater than myself. Over the past 14 years God has given me the honor to preach His word. In November 2013, God gave me the vision to plant a Church. This is not going to be an easy task but I’m confident that God will make a way.</p><p>For almost 10 years I’ve had the pleasure of serving on the ministerial staff at Mount Carmel Baptist Church in Washington, DC. During this time, God has developed in me a huge passion for ministering to His people. I feel that this has been one of the greatest experiences – one in which I’ve grown in so many ways.</p><p>At Mount Carmel I was given so many leadership opportunities. Over the years I’ve helped to start an after school program for teens as well as a Sunday evening service for college students and young adults. I’ve also partnered with the community to host community events and forums. I had the opportunity to learn about radio by helping the church expand their radio broadcast from one to ten cities.

Armed with the strength and courage of Christ, Ashleigh embarks on the most difficult and challenging thing she's ever done; look inward and dig up the darkest corners of her memory. Her calling to share comes with the hope other women will find solace and comfort in the challenges of growing up in a broken home, the pressures of being a teenager,  the disappointment of a failed career, the struggle of marriage, the challenges of motherhood, and all the moments of joy in between.</p><p>With the contributions of many believers, we can spread the Word and help change lives in a relatable way to those seeking His comfort. </p><p>This campaign would put together a practical tool that can be referred back to in times of hurt, need and inspiration. Many people have difficulty in finding or interpreting the Word when they need it most. Desperate for a message, they leaf through the Bible, searching for exactly what they need to hear at that moment. Or, they do achieve comfort from scripture, but unsure how to pray to our Heavenly Father. I propose a guidebook that accomplishes both using thoughtful, descriptive and relatable content with stories of my personal experiences, and ideas for prayer for those seeking a closer relationship with Jesus.</p><p><strong>What's Needed and What You Get</strong></p><p>The entire publishing process from start to finish costs approximately $9,600.

Armed with the strength and courage of Christ, Ashleigh embarks on the most difficult and challenging thing she's ever done; look inward and dig up the darkest corners of her memory. Her calling to share comes with the hope other women will find solace and comfort in the challenges of growing up in a broken home, the pressures of being a teenager,  the disappointment of a failed career, the struggle of marriage, the challenges of motherhood, and all the moments of joy in between.With the contributions of many believers, we can spread the Word and help change lives in a relatable way to those seeking His comfort. This campaign would put together a practical tool that can be referred back to in times of hurt, need and inspiration. Many people have difficulty in finding or interpreting the Word when they need it most. Desperate for a message, they leaf through the Bible, searching for exactly what they need to hear at that moment. Or, they do achieve comfort from scripture, but unsure how to pray to our Heavenly Father. I propose a guidebook that accomplishes both using thoughtful, descriptive and relatable content with stories of my personal experiences, and ideas for prayer for those seeking a closer relationship with Jesus.What's Needed and What You GetThe entire publishing process from start to finish costs approximately $9,600.

From pre-ordered copies to signed hardcovers and more, the opportunity to share in God's purpose is exciting! Check out the perks for the potential reward for contributing to this worthy cause!If the total goal isn't met, there is potential to self publish with a much smaller, less professional process. Overall marketing and distribution would be massively affected, although I would do my best to spread the message through social media and word of mouth. Any funds received will be put to good use, and perks will be honoured.

The Tories have taken office with just 37% of the vote – in fact, if you take turnout into account, less than a quarter of us voted for them. Meanwhile the Green Party got over a million votes and only one MP!</p>
<p>There are many voices pointing this out, but so far it has found little campaigning expression beyond e-petitions. Of course e-petitions have their place, but we believe we need to go much further: <b>there is</b> <b>a historic opportunity to launch a</b> <b>huge, public campaign for proportional representation</b>.</p> <p>That's why we're asking you to do more than just click, like and share. Our voting system now looks illegitimate in the eyes of millions and we have the best chance in many years to make a change – if you agree, we need you to put your money where your mouth is.</p>
<p>94 countries use proportional representation. There is no reason why Britain should continue to be an exception. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>Proportional representation could transform British politics and give us hope again.<br/><br/></b></span></p> </div> <div> <h3>What we want to do</h3> <p>We want to campaign in every way possible – this won't be won by any one tactic alone, but by a diversity of tactics. What we can do will be determined but how much funding we get, but here are our aims:</p> <ul> <li>A range of materials putting the case for proportional representation in clear, accessible language – from infographics to stickers, from leaflets to videos.</li> <li>Working for a high mainstream media and social media profile.<i> (If this campaign is successful then that will become a media story in itself, putting proportional representation on the agenda.) </i>
</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Online tools to lobby MPs, showing them the demand for proportional representation at this crucial moment.</span></li>
<li>Rallies, events and actions – we need to do everything we can to get the word out.</li>
<li>An effort to build a network of local campaigners to go beyond online activism.</li> </ul>

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Questions &amp; answers</span><br/>
</h3>
</div><div> <p><b>Didn't voters reject voting reform in the alternative vote (AV) referendum?</b></p>
<p>No, they rejected AV! AV is not a proportional representation system and is inferior in many ways. Many people who campaign passionately for proportional representation felt uninspired by it, so the campaign was lacklustre and the status quo prevailed.</p>
<p><b>What if proportional representation would favour a party I dislike?</b></p>
<p>Some media outlets have published charts of ""what parliament would look like under proportional representation"". However, we urge caution about drawing conclusions from the way people vote under the current first-past-the-post system. Tactical voting and other distortions mean that an election under proportional representation would likely look very different – several political parties might even cease to exist in their current form. </p>
<p><b>Wouldn't proportional representation mean MPs don't represent local constituencies any more?</b></p>
<p>Not necessarily. The proportional representation systems used for elections to the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and London Assembly, for example, work on an 'additional member' system. Elections are still held in local constituencies, but there is also a second vote for a party list, which is used to 'top up' the seats and make them proportional.</p>
<p><b>Who are you anyway?</b></p>
<p>We are a group of experienced campaigners, currently including members of the Green party, Labour party, Left Unity and National Health Action party. If you'd like to help out then we'd love to hear from you – see 'Get involved' below.</p>
<p><b>Aren't there already campaigns on proportional representation?</b></p>
<p>We don't want to tread on anyone's toes, but the existing campaigns have generally focused on electoral reform as a whole, and often used quite technical language. We want to create an accessible, mass campaign for proportional representation.</p>
<p><b>If you want to be accessible then why use the word 'proportional'?</b></p>
<p>It's true that it's not the simplest of words and requires some explanation, but we believe it is important to be precise. Previous efforts have used slogans such as 'fair votes' or 'change the voting system'. This can muddy the waters by allowing politicians to respond with systems such as the alternative vote (AV), which is not a proportional system. We believe that only proportional representation provides the answer and that is why we use the term.</p>

</div></div>","Short summary Our democracy is broken. The Tories have taken office with just 37% of the vote – in fact, if you take turnout into account, less than a quarter of us voted for them. Meanwhile the Green Party got over a million votes and only one MP!
There are many voices pointing this out, but so far it has found little campaigning expression beyond e-petitions. Of course e-petitions have their place, but we believe we need to go much further: there is a historic opportunity to launch a huge, public campaign for proportional representation. That's why we're asking you to do more than just click, like and share. Our voting system now looks illegitimate in the eyes of millions and we have the best chance in many years to make a change – if you agree, we need you to put your money where your mouth is.
94 countries use proportional representation. There is no reason why Britain should continue to be an exception. Proportional representation could transform British politics and give us hope again.   What we want to do We want to campaign in every way possible – this won't be won by any one tactic alone, but by a diversity of tactics. What we can do will be determined but how much funding we get, but here are our aims:  A range of materials putting the case for proportional representation in clear, accessible language – from infographics to stickers, from leaflets to videos. Working for a high mainstream media and social media profile. (If this campaign is successful then that will become a media story in itself, putting proportional representation on the agenda.) 

Online tools to lobby MPs, showing them the demand for proportional representation at this crucial moment.
Rallies, events and actions – we need to do everything we can to get the word out.
An effort to build a network of local campaigners to go beyond online activism.

Questions & answers

 Didn't voters reject voting reform in the alternative vote (AV) referendum?
No, they rejected AV! AV is not a proportional representation system and is inferior in many ways. Many people who campaign passionately for proportional representation felt uninspired by it, so the campaign was lacklustre and the status quo prevailed.
What if proportional representation would favour a party I dislike?
Some media outlets have published charts of ""what parliament would look like under proportional representation"". However, we urge caution about drawing conclusions from the way people vote under the current first-past-the-post system. Tactical voting and other distortions mean that an election under proportional representation would likely look very different – several political parties might even cease to exist in their current form. 
Wouldn't proportional representation mean MPs don't represent local constituencies any more?
Not necessarily. The proportional representation systems used for elections to the Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly and London Assembly, for example, work on an 'additional member' system. Elections are still held in local constituencies, but there is also a second vote for a party list, which is used to 'top up' the seats and make them proportional.
Who are you anyway?
We are a group of experienced campaigners, currently including members of the Green party, Labour party, Left Unity and National Health Action party. If you'd like to help out then we'd love to hear from you – see 'Get involved' below.
Aren't there already campaigns on proportional representation?
We don't want to tread on anyone's toes, but the existing campaigns have generally focused on electoral reform as a whole, and often used quite technical language. We want to create an accessible, mass campaign for proportional representation.
If you want to be accessible then why use the word 'proportional'?
It's true that it's not the simplest of words and requires some explanation, but we believe it is important to be precise. Previous efforts have used slogans such as 'fair votes' or 'change the voting system'. This can muddy the waters by allowing politicians to respond with systems such as the alternative vote (AV), which is not a proportional system. We believe that only proportional representation provides the answer and that is why we use the term.
What's the symbol?
It's the mathematical symbol for 'proportional'. It's also a nice shape.

I wrote this book because I have had enough of the social isolation I and others experience for the “discrepancy” between our genetics and our ideas. The biggest obstacle in rebuilding our political and social arena in modern-America is the very social isolation I speak of. I believe the cause of it to be the same people who claim to understand the struggles of others and champion their causes as allies. Sympathy is not empathy. At the sight of my people’s brown skin, we are greatly “valued” by social advocates because we “matter and deserve a seat at the table”. But when we disagree, we are “traitors” and simply “not woke enough.”<br/><br/>Conservatism is not Republicanism, but the recent conflation of the two things has damaged our country. By conflating personal and social values to objective policy prescriptions that do not necessarily correspond with them, we force ourselves into a corner with our faces toward the wall. There’s no way we can begin to sympathize with something we corner ourselves into never understanding. At its core, my book is about the obvious truth no longer commonly practiced: politics is beyond appearance.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will understand that conservative principles reach far below the surface of everyday liberal-conservative politics. I hope to instill in you the same passion and excitement that I have for understanding society’s facade of understanding the marginalized for its own social and political gain. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you gain special insight into the experiences of everyday people like me, who are assumed by outsiders to have specific ideas, characteristics, and experiences simply because of the way we look.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>With wild nights and wacky misadventures, turning eighteen is supposed to be sick. That is, unless you literally get sick, and all your expectations for a conventional college experience plummet down the gutter. I’m Elianor, and I’m writing this book about how spending time in the hospital made me realize that life sucks. But it’s taking sucky-ness, whether it’s an illness, dysfunctional family, or a combination of both, and transforming it into success that makes it worth living.<br/><br/><i>Dealing with Dramedies</i> is an honest look into the glamorously unglamorous triple life of a restless perfectionist: a student, patient, and writer dealing with her own dramatic comedy. My rapid physical regression from a rare autoimmune disorder called Necrotizing Autoimmune Myopathy should’ve stopped me in my tracks, but my morbid sense of humor allowed me to rise above it all. In my book, I go over my journey from the diagnosis to daily rundown, while actively receiving care and responding with “I almost died again, but now I’m totally fine” to my close friends when they call me up.<br/><br/>I wrote this book because I want you, the reader, to know that if you’ve had your fair share of trauma, it’s possible to look at it right in the eye, laugh, and leverage it to your advantage. You’re not alone, and you’re definitely not doomed.<br/><br/>Perhaps you want to know how I won screenwriting awards as a novice, conducted medical research, and maintained a high GPA in challenging classes when my go-to hangout was the hospital. Or maybe you want to hear how acclaimed storytellers from all walks of life transformed their struggles into strengths:</p>
<ul>
<li>How Oscar nominee Nadine Labaki reached global acclaim coming from an underrepresented background</li>
<li>How Luke Jennings turned the spy thriller genre on its head with his <i>Killing Eve </i>book series</li>
<li>How <i>YOU’</i>s Caroline Kepnes turned her interior monologues into a worldwide bestseller and Netflix hit</li>
<li>How Dr. Jill Bolte-Taylor, as a neuroanatomist and acclaimed author, persevered after her serious stroke</li>
<li>How screenwriter Anna Klassen made it big in Hollywood despite being discouraged to chase after La La land</li>
<li>How accomplished journalist Andrea Towers' experience with Marvel Entertainment and superheroes changed her perception</li>
<li>...And there are many more exclusive interviews included!</li>

<h3>The Book</h3>
<p><i>Dealing with Dramedies</i> is written in 2 parts.</p>
<p><br/>Part 1, titled Dealing, contains the introduction and the chapters detailing my college experience pre- and post-diagnosis, where the reader will learn the importance of persistence and find solutions to ""impossible"" situations.</p>
<p>Part 2, titled Dramedies, includes stories and insights based on interviews and research with storytellers. These remarkable individuals used the challenges they faced in their personal lives to advance their professional careers.</p>
<p>At the end of the book, you will find toolkits to support yourself when you're struggling, to better support someone in your life who has chronic illness, and a fact sheet about NAM.</p>
<p>It's important to me to raise awareness about a condition that's so rare that it's unheard of, even amongst the medical community. By detailing my experience from both a moral and medical standpoint, I hope to offer an insightful look into the life of patients like myself.</p>

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>Unfocused: The Journey to Self-Actualization</i> is a book about truly redefining what success means and the journey of self-actualization. This book goes into depth about the role of goal-reliance in our current definition of success. It emphasizes the need to focus more on the present, with the past as a gentle guide, and the future as a medium for fueling our curiosity.</p>
<p>My name is Ester Teper and I am the author of <i>Unfocused</i>. I wrote this book because I felt there was an inherent gap between research, religion, popular psychology, and personal experiences. This book brings these aspects together and provides the reader with action-items.</p>
<p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover what self-actualization means to you, in this moment. I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for understanding our lives as more value-driven, mission-focused, and vision-fueled. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you find your path in some way.</p>
<p>In this book, you'll hear stories from over 125 individuals, among which are leaders and innovators in their respective fields, including medicine, law, religion, education, fitness, and art. These are people from around the globe who have shared their stories with me, and now I get to pass them along to you. Included among them are Jeffrey Seller, producer of Hamilton, who was able to apply his authentic passion for producing and take it to the stage; former US Ambassador to Canada Bruce Heyman, and his lovely wife Mrs. Vicki Heyman, who used art and culture to forge a stronger bond between nations; and Holocaust survivor and psychologist Dr. Edith Eger, a lively and animated woman with love for everyone she crosses paths with. </p>
<p><i>Unfocused</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to young readers and go-getters who want to look at purpose, success, and goals in a new way. </p>
<h3>
<br/>The Book - <i>Unfocused</i>
</h3>
<p>The book is written in 4 parts.</p>
<ul>
<li>Part 1 contains the introduction and explains the working definition for self-actualization. </li>
<li>Part 2 contains chapters about the Values. It focuses on generosity, curiosity, and authenticity. </li>
<li>Part 3 contains chapters about the Mission. It helps the reader develop a clear mission statement based on the foundational values covered in Part 2.</li>
<li>Part 4 contains chapters about the Vision. This is the true mindset change which will allow you to relinquish the need for constant control over your future.</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>
<p> This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Ester Teper is a junior at Vanderbilt University studying Chemical Engineering and Communications in Science and Technology. She has completed a major core in Psychology from Fairleigh Dickinson University, as well as an Associate Degree in Piano from the Associated Board of the Royal School of Music. </p>
<p>Ester started writing this book as a way to better understand her own mission and vision for life, and realizes that the theoretical concepts she learned about in her psychology courses were actually a passion. More research led to more questions, and the content started to pile up. That, combined with over 120 interviews, inspired her to write the book she wishes she could read: a combination of religion, research, interviews, and personal experiences. </p>
<p>For fun, Ester has returned to her third-grade self and started a book collection. When she is not searching for books to read, she is actually reading them on Vanderbilt's beautiful campus, engaging in Jewish life, or connecting with girls in her engineering sorority. Instead of writing this right now, Ester should probably clean her room, but that's a problem for next weekend :)</p>

</div></div>","Story of My Book
Unfocused: The Journey to Self-Actualization is a book about truly redefining what success means and the journey of self-actualization. This book goes into depth about the role of goal-reliance in our current definition of success. It emphasizes the need to focus more on the present, with the past as a gentle guide, and the future as a medium for fueling our curiosity.
My name is Ester Teper and I am the author of Unfocused. I wrote this book because I felt there was an inherent gap between research, religion, popular psychology, and personal experiences. This book brings these aspects together and provides the reader with action-items.
My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover what self-actualization means to you, in this moment. I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for understanding our lives as more value-driven, mission-focused, and vision-fueled. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you find your path in some way.
In this book, you'll hear stories from over 125 individuals, among which are leaders and innovators in their respective fields, including medicine, law, religion, education, fitness, and art. These are people from around the globe who have shared their stories with me, and now I get to pass them along to you. Included among them are Jeffrey Seller, producer of Hamilton, who was able to apply his authentic passion for producing and take it to the stage; former US Ambassador to Canada Bruce Heyman, and his lovely wife Mrs. Vicki Heyman, who used art and culture to forge a stronger bond between nations; and Holocaust survivor and psychologist Dr. Edith Eger, a lively and animated woman with love for everyone she crosses paths with. 
Unfocused is a nonfiction book that speaks to young readers and go-getters who want to look at purpose, success, and goals in a new way. 

The Book - Unfocused

The book is written in 4 parts.

Part 1 contains the introduction and explains the working definition for self-actualization. 
Part 2 contains chapters about the Values. It focuses on generosity, curiosity, and authenticity. 
Part 3 contains chapters about the Mission. It helps the reader develop a clear mission statement based on the foundational values covered in Part 2.
Part 4 contains chapters about the Vision. This is the true mindset change which will allow you to relinquish the need for constant control over your future.

 
What I Need & What You'll Get
 This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:

The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in August, 2021.

The layout design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).
The copy editing for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.
The launch & promotion efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this summer.

When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition and an audiobook.

About the Author
Ester Teper is a junior at Vanderbilt University studying Chemical Engineering and Communications in Science and Technology. She has completed a major core in Psychology from Fairleigh Dickinson University, as well as an Associate Degree in Piano from the Associated Board of the Royal School of Music. 
Ester started writing this book as a way to better understand her own mission and vision for life, and realizes that the theoretical concepts she learned about in her psychology courses were actually a passion. More research led to more questions, and the content started to pile up. That, combined with over 120 interviews, inspired her to write the book she wishes she could read: a combination of religion, research, interviews, and personal experiences. 
For fun, Ester has returned to her third-grade self and started a book collection. When she is not searching for books to read, she is actually reading them on Vanderbilt's beautiful campus, engaging in Jewish life, or connecting with girls in her engineering sorority. Instead of writing this right now, Ester should probably clean her room, but that's a problem for next weekend :)

Risks & Challenges
 The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier.
The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.

We met six years ago teaching on the Southside of Chicago. As co-teachers, we spent a lot of time together...and we mean <strong>a lot</strong> of time. Naturally much our conversations were centered around what and how we would be teaching. Our discussions also encompassed many other topics like that of race and the inequities that are prevalent for our students. Sometimes our conversations got uncomfortable. Hard questions were asked and we spent hours listening to each other. These honest and tough conversations are the reason our professional relationship extended to a true friendship. </p><p>So...we get that talking about race isn’t easy. It’s often hard knowing what to say and how to best say it. Notice how we said it can be difficult to “talk” about race. We meant to say that. Now let’s consider what it’s like to <i>teach</i> students about race, inequities, and what our society is facing as a whole right now. Feeling tongue tied? We’re here with you. </p><p>As educators, we know the value of read alouds and classroom discussions. If certain conversations aren’t happening within the home, we can only hope they’re taking place within the classroom. Eventually we found ourselves talking about the number of resources our classrooms were lacking so that we could begin having more conversation around race. Yes, teachers do way more than focus on the Common Core State Standards! Luckily, we have time embedded into the day for teaching social emotional skills and this also allows us to be responsive to the needs of our students. More often than not, what happens outside of the classroom becomes a topic of conversation and a moment for learning within the classroom. </p><p>Luckily for us, we know what we have to do when something is missing within our classrooms. Luckily for you, we knew our messages were too valuable to keep to ourselves and we wanted to bring you on this journey with us. Our hope is that our books will go beyond the classroom and into the homes of all students. We trust that you’ll enjoy learning along with us and being a part of The Race to Understand. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603266677/fpfqoeln0ljbrl0nrfhg.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Before we sat down to write, we knew we wanted to educate and inspire society to think, be, and do better. We wanted to make tough conversations about race more accessible to children, parents, and educators. This summer we did just that. Together, we came up with two book ideas. Writing and publishing one book before we started the other was never discussed. We knew that BOTH books had to be written because their messages were equally important. </p><p>During the summer, we came up with several book ideas. We have so much more to share and that led to us creating The Race to Understand. Our goal here today is to keep it about our first two books, but we cannot wait to share more about the additional children’s books and classroom resources that are in the works. </p><p>Learn more about our story by reading the Q &amp; A blog post we did with Indiegogo. </p><p> <a href=""https://go.indiegogo.com/blog/2020/11/seeing-color-in-a-new-light-a-qa-with-katie-engelking-and-marley-olivera.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://go.indiegogo.com/blog/2020/11/seeing-color-in-a-new-light-a-qa-with-katie-engelking-and-marley-olivera.html</a></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603266705/gzfoedypjfl8bx3fbigv.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>OUR FIRST TWO BOOKS</h3><p>It’s so important that our books get into the hands of K-8th grade students.

<p><strong><i>Humble Dream </i>is a book about African women leaders where I share the stories of women who inspire and impact others for good.</strong><br/><br/>My name is Meriem Boudjadja and I am the author of Humble Dream. I wrote this book because I wanted to showcase African inspirational stories and move away from the negative narrative and stereotypes around Africa.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that despite adverse circumstances, African women are carving a great future for themselves and paving the way forward for other younger women. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for women empowerment. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you feel inspired about what can be achieved when you start small.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about skills that leaders exhibit, how you can become a leader by tweaking tradition, by dreaming, and by solving a problem for yourself or for your community. You'll hear stories about people such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>Isabelle Sambou, who enjoyed traditional wrestling in Senegal and took it all the way to the Olympics. </li>
<li>Marie Korsaga, who became the first doctor in Astrophysics in West Africa coming from a country where one in three girls can read and write. </li>

The book follows the stories of several players and looks at the ECHL’s current developmental situation.<br/><br/>My name is Griffin Germond and I am the author of The Importance of the ECHL in Developing NHL-Caliber Players. I wrote this book because there is limited literature and coverage on the ECHL, I believe that the league unfairly gets a bad rep, and I think that it is very important to realize the ECHL as a legitimate and true developmental league for NHL players and prospects.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that the ECHL has successfully developed 662 alumni to the NHL and that the league is trending in the right direction to increase those numbers. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the ECHL, NHL, and player development in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you better understand ice hockey player development through the ECHL.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll also learn about some of the players that have gone from the ECHL to the NHL and the developmental future of the league:</p><ul>
<li>This past October, Connor LaCouvee started the season as the third goaltender on the Maine Mariners, behind NHL contracted goaltenders, Chris Nell, and Brandon Halverson. In June, he was facing Cole Caufield, the Canadiens’ first-round pick in the 2019 NHL entry draft, on a breakaway in Montréal’s developmental camp. Who woulda thought?<br/> </li>
<li>After coming off of an explosive final season in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League in 2013, Josh Currie had his eyes set on an NHL contract. The AHL was a second thought, and the ECHL wasn’t even a thought, to begin with. Yet, as fate would have it, he wound up in the ECHL the next season after failing to make the AHL’s Portland Pirates out of training camp. Though disappointed, he persevered, rounding out his game, and finally had a chance to prove his worth this past year in Edmonton.<br/> </li>
<li>The Newfoundland Growlers are one of the newest expansion franchises in the ECHL and are the proud affiliate of the Toronto Marlies and Toronto Maple Leafs. Franchise expectations were set high early on, and those expectations were fulfilled and exceeded, as Newfoundland won the Kelly Cup. The Growlers utilized 9 players under the age of 22. Yet, there are still some doubts about whether or not they paved the way for how development should be done at this level.</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>You will love this book if you’re a casual hockey fan, a hardcore hockey fan, and/or a minor league hockey fan. <br/><br/><i>The Importance of the ECHL in Developing NHL-Caliber Players</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to hockey fans and players who are looking at minor league hockey and the ECHL as a true developmental league for the first time.</p><h2><strong>The Book - The Importance of the ECHL in Developing NHL-Caliber Players</strong></h2><p>The book is currently written in 5 Chapters, as opposed to parts...<br/><br/><strong>Chapter 1</strong>: 3 parts. They contain the introduction + additional background to help better understand the ECHL, its history, and why I’m writing this book. One of the most famous goals in hockey history, specifically Vancouver Canucks history, was made possible by an undrafted player who worked his way through the minors and ultimately, into the hearts of many fans, and the hatred of others.<br/><br/><strong>Chapter 2</strong>: 5 parts. In this chapter, you’ll meet some new faces. Four of the five I’ve interviewed directly and all have unique stories in their developmental phases in the ECHL. The fifth is somewhat of ‘exceptional talent,’ who’s been the subject of debate, as well as praise and disregard. But, he’s out to prove something.<br/><br/><strong>Chapter 3</strong>: 5 parts. This chapter talks about how these players’ experiences take form, and how we can learn from those experiences. This chapter goes over the importance of experience and opportunities, connections, and the mental and physical sides of the game that must be realized in a highly competitive professional environment.<br/><br/><strong>Chapter 4</strong>: 2 parts. The chapter is about “developing development,” which is the best way to describe it. There are insights into the Kelly Cup-winning Newfoundland Growlers and why they’re so important, as well as problems encountered in ECHL development.<br/><br/><strong>Chapter 5</strong>: 4 parts. These parts primarily focus on how the ECHL can do better for its players and be a better developmental league. This includes better scheduling, more financial stability, and the importance of streamlined development through affiliates.<br/><br/>After the 5th Chapter, there are also some ‘<strong>Final Thoughts</strong>’ to end on.<br/> </p><h2><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></h2><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

The book follows the stories of several players and looks at the ECHL’s current developmental situation.My name is Griffin Germond and I am the author of The Importance of the ECHL in Developing NHL-Caliber Players. I wrote this book because there is limited literature and coverage on the ECHL, I believe that the league unfairly gets a bad rep, and I think that it is very important to realize the ECHL as a legitimate and true developmental league for NHL players and prospects.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that the ECHL has successfully developed 662 alumni to the NHL and that the league is trending in the right direction to increase those numbers. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the ECHL, NHL, and player development in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you better understand ice hockey player development through the ECHL.In this book, you'll also learn about some of the players that have gone from the ECHL to the NHL and the developmental future of the league:
This past October, Connor LaCouvee started the season as the third goaltender on the Maine Mariners, behind NHL contracted goaltenders, Chris Nell, and Brandon Halverson. In June, he was facing Cole Caufield, the Canadiens’ first-round pick in the 2019 NHL entry draft, on a breakaway in Montréal’s developmental camp. Who woulda thought? 
After coming off of an explosive final season in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League in 2013, Josh Currie had his eyes set on an NHL contract. The AHL was a second thought, and the ECHL wasn’t even a thought, to begin with. Yet, as fate would have it, he wound up in the ECHL the next season after failing to make the AHL’s Portland Pirates out of training camp. Though disappointed, he persevered, rounding out his game, and finally had a chance to prove his worth this past year in Edmonton. 
The Newfoundland Growlers are one of the newest expansion franchises in the ECHL and are the proud affiliate of the Toronto Marlies and Toronto Maple Leafs. Franchise expectations were set high early on, and those expectations were fulfilled and exceeded, as Newfoundland won the Kelly Cup. The Growlers utilized 9 players under the age of 22. Yet, there are still some doubts about whether or not they paved the way for how development should be done at this level.
 You will love this book if you’re a casual hockey fan, a hardcore hockey fan, and/or a minor league hockey fan. The Importance of the ECHL in Developing NHL-Caliber Players is a non-fiction book that speaks to hockey fans and players who are looking at minor league hockey and the ECHL as a true developmental league for the first time.The Book - The Importance of the ECHL in Developing NHL-Caliber PlayersThe book is currently written in 5 Chapters, as opposed to parts...Chapter 1: 3 parts. They contain the introduction + additional background to help better understand the ECHL, its history, and why I’m writing this book. One of the most famous goals in hockey history, specifically Vancouver Canucks history, was made possible by an undrafted player who worked his way through the minors and ultimately, into the hearts of many fans, and the hatred of others.Chapter 2: 5 parts. In this chapter, you’ll meet some new faces. Four of the five I’ve interviewed directly and all have unique stories in their developmental phases in the ECHL. The fifth is somewhat of ‘exceptional talent,’ who’s been the subject of debate, as well as praise and disregard. But, he’s out to prove something.Chapter 3: 5 parts. This chapter talks about how these players’ experiences take form, and how we can learn from those experiences. This chapter goes over the importance of experience and opportunities, connections, and the mental and physical sides of the game that must be realized in a highly competitive professional environment.Chapter 4: 2 parts. The chapter is about “developing development,” which is the best way to describe it. There are insights into the Kelly Cup-winning Newfoundland Growlers and why they’re so important, as well as problems encountered in ECHL development.Chapter 5: 4 parts. These parts primarily focus on how the ECHL can do better for its players and be a better developmental league. This includes better scheduling, more financial stability, and the importance of streamlined development through affiliates.After the 5th Chapter, there are also some ‘Final Thoughts’ to end on. What I Need & What You'll GetThis book will be published with New Degree Press.

 About the AuthorGriffin Germond is a first-time author for New Degree Press. He is also a proud alumnus of the Communication and Media Studies Department at the University of Southern Maine, Class of 2019, and Gorham High School (Maine), Class of 2015.He wrote this book because he has a passion for the sport of ice hockey, and being a season ticket holder for the ECHL’s Maine Mariners and attending a total of 39 Mariners games this past season alone, he felt that this is a topic he should pursue.When he’s not watching hockey, he’s probably excitedly counting down the days until it’s back on.For more information, you can connect with Griffin at griffin.germond@maine.edu, on LinkedIn, and on Instagram. Risks & ChallengesThe biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier. The shipping is included in the cost for anywhere worldwide.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.Other Ways You Can HelpSome people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:Please share my Pre-sale Campaign on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn with your friends, family, and network.

Urantia Foundation and Urantia Fellowship have worked together to create a Standard Reference Text (SRT) which contains changes to the 1955 edition. We believe that the unaltered inviolate first edition is an essential anchor for the revelation and a necessary complement to the SRT editions.Please join us in this historic effort to reprint the inviolate first edition text of The Urantia Book and restore it into the evolutionary mainstream. It is also a rare opportunity to acquire a copy of a true keepsake of a lifetime.For more information, visit our website at www.urantiabookfirstedition.comThe following “Certificate of Authenticity” will be published within each copy of this inviolate first edition printing:",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

After writing a blog post featuring a small part of his story, I learned more information from my cousin, Vicky, and wanted to expand the entire family’s story into book form.

I'm hoping to enlighten people on how the immigration process worked when my dad came to this country, and how it is set up today. I realize my dad was never an illegal immigrant, but through his story, I realized how easily a person could become one and I'm hoping readers of my book will learn that too.</p><p>My book will feature stories about my dad’s family such as my Uncle Pete who came to the United States with a note that simply read, “Bucyrus, America.” Uncle Pete eventually opened his own shoe shine business in downtown Bucyrus, and many local residents worked for him. The actual shoe shine stand that was used in his shop is now on exhibit at the Bucyrus Historical Society. My book will also feature the true love story of my parents, how they met and the obstacles they faced trying to date because of prejudices that my grandfather had towards “foreigners.” It will highlight my dad’s job loss due to downsizing and his subsequent success in opening a Greek Restaurant in a town in which many residents had never even tried Greek food! It will tell how my mom learned to cook Greek foods as perfectly as she did the Southern foods she ate while growing up. In essence, this book will show how people can be very different from each other, yet so similar in more ways than they realize.

<p><i>Life in Yellow</i> is a memoir about my own journey with personal growth and acceptance after experiencing hardship. .<br/><br/>My name is Liz Irons and I am the author of <i>Life in Yellow</i>. I wrote this book to reflect on my mom’s colon cancer diagnosis and treatment throughout my sophomore year of high school. At the time, I wrote about our family’s experience for my local newspaper and felt a surge of comfort in sharing my story. As I’ve grown, I’ve wanted to experience that comfort and strength again and share the insights I’ve gained from this experience and others.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover something new about yourself.

I want you to see this book as an opportunity to further understand and cherish those around you — to build more honest relationships within your immediate family, with your friends, and even with yourself.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll encounter multifaceted dimensions of what it means to be a woman and how to aspire towards selflessness through narratives that include:</p>
<ul>
<li>A story about discovering the power behind a pair of yellow hospital socks and what it means to care for a parent who’s only ever taken care of you.</li>
<li>An essay about the way women idolize one another when seeking out their own perfection and how this journey can lead to its own highs and lows starting at a very young age.</li>

<ul>
<li>How do we measure our own progress over time? Do we like this current version of ourselves?</li>
<li>How do we balance being a more selfless and loving friend/family member while still prioritizing our own independent growth?</li>
<li>How can we further empower young women to share their stories?</li>

</p><p><b>ANGELA </b>fits many 3<sup>rd</sup>
world child stereotypes. Small for her age, lives in an orphanage, 11 years old
but studies in the 1<sup>st</sup> grade. Powerful images of children like
Angela from developing countries frequently solicit our attention on TV or online
in order to provoke an altruistic response; who can say no to a child in need? But
would their stories be the same if the children were the ones doing the

<p>Would you have guessed that when
asked to describe herself Angela ended her response with <i>y me gusta como soy</i> – and I like the way I am? In fact, during a
series of pilot workshops designed to allow a class of first graders to explore
and take pride in their unique identities this past spring, the students
responded with an abundance of profound, heart-felt, and eye opening examples of
what it means to be an elementary school student from Quetzaltenango,
Guatemala. Many were responses that children from the developing world have
traditionally been denied from expressing in American mass media. One student wrote
that they want to be a police officer when they grow up to “round up all the
thieves and assassins to make the country a better place.” Many wrote about how
much they care about their families. Several of the 6 and 7 year olds were simply
emphatic about their dislike of vegetables. We’ve ignored their voices for too
long. </p>
<p><b>Why <i>Y Me Gusta Como Soy</i> Matters</b></p>
<p>While cultural and racial
diversity continue to rise among US school children, the diversity of
children’s literature they have access to has not kept pace. In fact, today a
large gap exists in children’s literature leaving many minority groups under
represented in bookstores, in libraries, and in classrooms. According to the <a href=""http://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator_cge.asp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">US Department of Education National Center for Educational Statistics</a> and the
<a href=""http://ccbc.education.wisc.edu/books/pcstats.asp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cooperative Children’s Book Center</a>, part of the University of Wisconsin’s
School of Education, minorities make up approximately 48% of the US K-12
student population, yet are only represented in about 8% of currently published
children’s books. By supporting <i>Y Me
Gusta Como Soy</i> you are helping to reduce this diversity gap. And you’re
helping to turn a class of elementary students into published authors. Future
sales of the <i>Y Me Gusta Como Soy</i>
children’s book will bring money back to the students and their school,
improving families’ economic security and providing a continued investment in
the education of the children. </p>

</p><p>This project is not about giving a
voice to the children. <i>It’s about
listening to what they have to say</i>. And what they have to say matters. <i>Y Me Gusta Como Soy</i> promotes
cross-cultural exchange – connecting the voices of children from one classroom
in Guatemala to the ears of children and families from all around the world –
and adds much needed cultural diversity to children’s literature. This isn’t a
book about children from a developing county; it's a book written by them.</p>

<p><b>Program Basics</b></p>
<p>The <i>Y Me Gusta Como Soy</i> campaign will fund a six-month long after
school program designed to engage the students in activities that strengthen
their academic performance and celebrate who they are. Activities will include
structured and unstructured writing prompts, artistic development through
drawing, painting and story-telling, reading and writing assistance, homework
help, and other activities designed by the children. Student material from the
after school program will be compiled to produce the contents of the bilingual book.

Runes are an ancient Germanic alphabet, used for writing, divination and magic. They were used throughout northern Europe, Scandinavia, the British Isles, and Iceland from about 100 B.C.E. to 1600 C.E. and the Elder Futhark is thought to be the oldest version of the runic alphabet.
Runic divination, ""runecasting"", is not just fortune telling. The runic symbols represent the entire universe. As one asks a question, one's conscious and unconscious mind focuses on that question, so that the runic cards selected are not just random selections, but are choices made by the subconscious.

The 24 runes of the Elder Futhark are in their prescribed order for a reason. Each rune and each aett in turn is built upon a foundation of the runes that proceed it in a logical and methodical pattern.

The organization and arrangement of the Elder Futhark has been in use and in place for 3,000 years. Even the name “Futhark” is a representation of the first six runes of the first aett.

<u><i>Making Moonshots.</i></u><br/>My name is Rahul Rana and I’m the author of Making Moonshots, a deep-dive into the mindsets, philosophies, and strategies that are conducive to building moonshot companies. These are businesses that take an advanced technology or science and use it in a radically-creative solution to solve a huge problem in the world. I’m writing this book because I want to inspire people to make more of these breakthrough startups. We can all benefit from more of them, as they work on the frontiers of what’s possible and take on seemingly-impossible missions with audacious, cutting-edge solutions.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the moonshot mindset, comprised of key mental models, guiding principles, and states of mind, and actively apply it to your own life. From maximizing human potential to navigating entrepreneurial complexity, I delve into various facets of the journey in making a world-changing company. While I portray them in the context of impactful deeptech startups, the universal lessons can be used for anyone’s personal goals. Ultimately, I hope to instill the same passion and excitement in you that I have for important breakthrough enterprises by demystifying the non-obvious aspects of founding one.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about:<ul>
<li>The characteristics of an innovative founder; their mindset, and how this translates into the process of materializing a groundbreaking idea.</li>
<li>Philosophies and mental models either used by these entrepreneurial pioneers or those that are proven to help make ideal decisions when dealing with AI, SpaceTech, BioTech, and so many more industries.</li>
<li>A blueprint for solving the most complex problems and then applying it to the real world, thus building an ecosystem of moonshot companies that solve the world’s most intractable problems. </li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are 1) excited by the future of science, technology, and entrepreneurship 2) if you want to make an impact on the world and 3) have a bold life mission that you want to fulfill.<br/><br/><i>Making Moonshots</i> is a non-fiction book that speaks to aspiring founders and STEM/business enthusiasts who are looking to solve the most pressing problems in our world by creating unique startups. A new golden age is about to erupt in modern times. Dare to dream bigger. Let’s make some moonshots.</p>

<h2>The Book - <i>Making Moonshots</i>
</h2>
<p><br/>The book is written in 4 Parts...</p>
<p><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the <strong>introduction</strong> + beginning chapters. This section is all about setting up the scene about what a moonshot company is, the etymology of the term, and the basics about it. It’s a general foundation for the blueprint to come. From Wally Moon and John F. Kennedy to Elon Musk and some lesser-known founders, you’ll get to see a complete profile on how to think like them.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong>, entitled <strong>The Moon</strong>, contains the intangible aspects— psychology and philosophy. In the 60’s, the Apollo missions were more than just a bold and seemingly-impossible task— the mindset that JFK imparted onto the nation was most valuable. Many are now applying a similar thought process to startups, as there are clear characteristics and mental models — from radical creativity to futurist thinking to stoicism — that define a moonshot founder.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong>, entitled <strong>The Shot</strong>, contains tangible aspects— strategy and ecosystem. Taking the aforementioned aspects of the radically-creative mindset, I delve into how to act upon it in the real world and how we can nurture an ecosystem of these impactful deeptech companies.<br/><br/><strong>Part 4</strong> contains the <strong>conclusion</strong>. This section is all about wrapping it up and leaving you, the reader, with a final call to action. I hope after reading it that you will go on to fulfill your life’s purpose and pursue your moonshot task within. It’s all about recognizing your truest passions and the chips on your shoulder to channel that energy into a meaningful project, whether it’s to ease human suffering, ensure planetary health, or anything else that truly matters to you.</p>

<p>In the land of Marlenia, <b>there are two kinds of people.</b></p>
<p>Those who <b>live on the surface (the Marlenians)</b>...</p>
<p>...and those who are <b>forced to live underground (the Freetors)</b>.</p>
<p><b>In the first book, <i>The Violet Fox,</i> </b>Kiera Driscoll (aka, The Violet Fox) was like a 15-year-old Robin Hood: she snuck up to the surface and stole food and resources for her people living underground. One day, she was tasked by the Elders to disguise herself as a princess from a neighbouring province on the surface and sneak into the castle to retrieve a stolen magical artefact. Of course, when she got to the castle, she became entangled in castle politics, and fell in love with the prince!</p>
<p><b>Now, in <i>The Silver Spear, </i></b>she faces a greater threat. Tensions are high between the West and the East. War threatens to break out, and her people are not ready. But far to the West at the edge of the world, on the land her ancestors used to own, the Silver Spear is rumored to lie deep in a cave from where no one has returned. Kiera, accompanied by Prince Keegan and a mysterious bard with a secret must make the journey across the land--risking their lives and the safety of the West--to retrieve a weapon that could unite the Freetors and the Marlenians against their common enemies.

<p><b>Read a sample from the second chapter here:</b></p>
<p>A gurgle-infused
whisper overlaid the Holy One’s once-powerful, booming voice. Today, it was
hoarse from not speaking for a while, but it still carried a strength that
would put fear into any law-disobeying Freetor. I left the door open a crack,
just in case Keegan or another attendant needed to come in.</p>
<p>I stepped closer
to the dying man. It was strange to think of him as a man, really. For so long
he was an untouchable figurehead, the leader of the surface world. He was
always old, always frail—but seeing his glazed-over eyes, the countless
wrinkles engraved in his sagging face, his skin dry and white and his
once-brilliant white hair now turning to ashen grey—I guess I never thought in
my life I’d feel sad for a man that supported the death of my people. That was
before I’d saved his life from Elder Erskina, though. I couldn’t have feelings
for Keegan and hate the man that gave him life.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to
sound rude or forward, but because death was near, I had to use my time with
him wisely. I sat on a stool beside the bed. “Why did you ask me here?” </p>
<p>One raspy breath
in, and another out. My fingers wrapped around the bedpost. If he died before
me, right now, Keegan would never forgive me. Whatever it was he had to tell
me, I had to get it out of him quick so Keegan could have his father back.</p>
<p>“Dashiell came
to me, in a dream,” the Holy One said finally.</p>
<p>I parted my lips
to speak, but he shook his head slowly. “I know your people don’t believe. I
know that…that my ancestors have done violent things in his name. But seeing
you…in the Grand Square…”</p>
<p>He fell into a
violent coughing fit. There was a pile of white tissues beside the collection
of remedies on the night table, and I offered him one, but it came back red.</p>
<p>He wiped his
mouth. “My dream…Dashiell, brilliant in white light. He spoke to me. He said, <i>my messenger will put me back together again</i>.
Do you know what this means?”</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>“Your name.
Kiera Driscoll.” He pronounced the words slowly, carefully. “In the library, in
the old texts, it says the Driscolls held land by the Forever Sea, near the
western-most tip of this province.” He held up a heavy hand and pointed to a
pile of tomes on the nightstand. “I have been reading about before the war.”</p>
<p>My breath
caught. I found my feet and sauntered to the texts. Information about my
ancestors, before the Marlenian-Freetor war. Not Rordan, nor my father, had
told me anything about what my family had done on the surface. All we’d known,
for two hundred years, was hate. </p>
<p>I flipped
through the pages. Most of them were faded records and maps of who held what
land, who was the eldest son of whom and what daughter had married what other
lesser lord. Some of the handwriting was so faded that it was impossible to
decipher. But if my family history was in here, then maybe Laoise’s was too,
and all the other Freetors. We would finally know what lands were really ours.</p>
<p>And so would the
Marlenians.</p>
<p>“Most of these
books were destroyed during the war,” the Holy One said. “No one wanted any
record of Freetors holding lands, in case one came to claim them.”</p>
<p>My hand passed
over the leather-bound cover. “What does this have to do with your dream?”</p>
<p>The Holy One
coughed blood again into a tissue clutched tightly in his hand. Even his
eyelids were creased with little wrinkles. I wondered how old he really was.</p>
<p>“Your name. <i>Driscoll.</i> It means, <i>the messenger.</i> Dashiell said, <i>the
messenger will put me back together again.</i>”</p>
<p>“That’s it?” I
knew I was being rude, but I couldn’t help it. </p>
<p>“The pieces of
Dashiell,” the Holy One said. “You know them.”</p>
<p>I frowned. “I
don’t know--”</p>
<p>“The pieces.” He
was more insistent this time. “The <i>artefacts.</i>”</p>
<p>Yes, I did know
them. The Orb of Dashiell, once held by the Holy One’s sceptre, was safe in my
quarters. That was one of them. </p>
<p>“The orb. The
cloth. The slab. The <i>spear.</i>” He
hacked more blood.</p>
<p>“I’m calling
Keegan. You need to rest,” I said.</p>
<p>I went for the
door when his powerful voice overcame me. “You must find the spear.”</p>
<p>I stopped, and
turned slowly. “The…Silver Spear?”</p>
<p>“Yes. You know
the story.”</p>
<p>Actually, I didn’t. Not really. There was a myth that Alastar the Hero had travelled to the
end of the Forever Sea and found a spear encased in ice. It was the most
beautiful thing he’d ever seen, and he wanted it, because he could see it was
magic. When he tried to break the ice with his own spells, it shattered and
marred his face. He lost an eye, some said. Others insisted that he played a
game of riddles with a magical tiger guarding the spear and lost, losing his
eye as penance, but still made off with the spear anyway. I didn’t know whether
or not he kept the spear, or whether this happened before or during the war. </p>
<p>“It’s just a
story,” I said. But even I could hear the uncertainty in my voice.</p>

<p><b>Book Themes</b></p>
<p>The Violet Fox Series explores three major themes.</p>
<p><b><i>1) The definition of freedom</i></b></p>
<p>For the first time in over 200 years, the Freetor people have a real shot at returning to their rightful place on the surface. No longer will they be forced to live underground. They are free.</p>
<p>Or are they? Just because the law has been changed, does not mean their freedom is guaranteed. There is no room on the surface for them, and many are too afraid to abandon the caves that they have come to know as home. Others feel that they are not free because those they consider to be their enemy still lives. Many Freetors see the Silver Spear as a symbol of their freedom, as it was the weapon of legend wielded by their ancestor against the Holy One of old, before they were forced underground. If Kiera retrieves it, it will give them the permission--the courage--they desperately seek to live in the sun once more.</p>
<p>The question is: is freedom something that must be given or ordained, or is it something that must be taken by force?</p>
<p><b><i>2) Love vs Duty</i></b></p>
<p>Kiera, our protagonist, struggles with this in the first book but now faces it head-on in <i>The Silver Spear</i>. She has deep feelings for Prince Keegan and is faced with the very real possibility of being the future queen of the land. But does she really love him, or is she marrying him to give her people a better future? Her feelings for him are tested as they journey together across the world in search of an artefact that may or may not exist--which only heightens the tension between the two of them, for she is dead certain that The Silver Spear does exist, and that it can help them win the inevitable war to come.</p>
<p><b><i>3) Prejudice against minorities</i></b></p>
<p>This has already been explored in <i>The Violet Fox</i>, but the theme is carried over in <i>The Silver Spear</i>. Prejudice doesn't disappear overnight and we see what happens when Kiera, a Freetor and once considered a Robin Hood figure, is now expected to rule over the people she used to steal from.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Publishing is a risky business, but I’ve done a lot to minimize my publishing costs. Editing is the one major cost for publishing a book, besides printing. The other aspects of publishing--interior formatting, eBook creation, cover design &amp; creation--are done by me or my partner.</p>
<p>This also isn’t my first rodeo. The Silver Spear will be my fifth publication and I’ve refined my process each time.</p>
<p><b>Wait, hold up, why does shipping cost so much?</b></p>
<p>Shipping in Canada is expensive. Books are heavy. Unfortunately, books like <i>The Violet Fox</i> and <i>The Silver Spear</i>, because of their page count, fall into the parcel category. Because of this, they are automatically at least $10 more expensive than shipping it as a letter (must fit through the letter slot). And that's just within Canada. Canada Post is the cheapest shipping solution I've found for my needs, <b>but if there's enough orders, I may be able to find a cheaper solution. So please, spread the word! </b>Or if the shipping is too much of a problem, choose the eBook versions for your reading needs. :)</p>
<p><b>What about your distribution?</b></p>
<p>My distribution is pretty limited at the moment. It's something I'd like to work on as I get more titles. It's not economically feasible for me to have a proper distributor since I a) don't always have proper print runs; b) many distributors don't take self-published books (even though I have branded myself as a press); c) I wouldn't make  as much money if I have to share a portion of the pie with someone else other than the store. Plus, the publisher is responsible for the costs of shipping to and from the store, which gets very expensive and also cuts into any money I might make. </p>
<p>I'm in select bookstores (changes every few months due to consignment limits), most of my print titles are available on Amazon for purchase, you can buy my titles on my website, but my main venue for selling is conventions. I travel across the country hand-selling my books and this has worked well for me so far.  Once I have a larger catalogue, I think it will make sense for me to partner with an existing publisher and utilize their distribution network. Until that day, I continue to work hard to make sure my books are seen and heard!</p>

</div></div>","Who are you?
My name is Clare C. Marshall, and I’m an author/publisher. My publishing imprint is Faery Ink Press, and I publish young adult science fiction, fantasy, and horror novels--all written by me. 

Since 2011 I’ve published one book a year and travelled across the country promoting my work at various conventions, readings, and signings. I also edit, format, and manage websites for a variety of authors like myself. Anything publishing-related, I’m there.
What is The Silver Spear?
The Silver Spear is the second book in the Violet Fox quadrilogy. 
In the land of Marlenia, there are two kinds of people.
Those who live on the surface (the Marlenians)...
...and those who are forced to live underground (the Freetors).
In the first book, The Violet Fox, Kiera Driscoll (aka, The Violet Fox) was like a 15-year-old Robin Hood: she snuck up to the surface and stole food and resources for her people living underground. One day, she was tasked by the Elders to disguise herself as a princess from a neighbouring province on the surface and sneak into the castle to retrieve a stolen magical artefact. Of course, when she got to the castle, she became entangled in castle politics, and fell in love with the prince!
Now, in The Silver Spear, she faces a greater threat. Tensions are high between the West and the East. War threatens to break out, and her people are not ready. But far to the West at the edge of the world, on the land her ancestors used to own, the Silver Spear is rumored to lie deep in a cave from where no one has returned. Kiera, accompanied by Prince Keegan and a mysterious bard with a secret must make the journey across the land--risking their lives and the safety of the West--to retrieve a weapon that could unite the Freetors and the Marlenians against their common enemies.

Cinderella meets Robin Hood: that’s the overall tone and plot of the series.
I’ve never heard of The Violet Fox.
You can pick it up from any eBook retailer ($3.99), select Canadian bookstores, or directly from the source at FaeryInkPress.com. The Violet Fox is also available at several of the perk levels.
But how do I know if I'll LIKE this book series?
If you enjoy:
1) Fairy tale retelling & adventure 
2) Detailed fantasy worlds
3) Castle intrigue, where no one is who they seem! (dun dun dun…)
4) Female protagonists who KICK BUTT!
5) Forbidden romance!! :O
6) Epic journeys across a fantasy land
...then you will enjoy The Violet Fox Series, and especially The Silver Spear.
Don't believe me? Try it for yourself. Sample of The Silver Spear, below (contains NO spoilers):


Read a sample from the second chapter here:
A gurgle-infused
whisper overlaid the Holy One’s once-powerful, booming voice. Today, it was
hoarse from not speaking for a while, but it still carried a strength that
would put fear into any law-disobeying Freetor. I left the door open a crack,
just in case Keegan or another attendant needed to come in.
I stepped closer
to the dying man. It was strange to think of him as a man, really. For so long
he was an untouchable figurehead, the leader of the surface world. He was
always old, always frail—but seeing his glazed-over eyes, the countless
wrinkles engraved in his sagging face, his skin dry and white and his
once-brilliant white hair now turning to ashen grey—I guess I never thought in
my life I’d feel sad for a man that supported the death of my people. That was
before I’d saved his life from Elder Erskina, though. I couldn’t have feelings
for Keegan and hate the man that gave him life.
I didn’t want to
sound rude or forward, but because death was near, I had to use my time with
him wisely. I sat on a stool beside the bed. “Why did you ask me here?” 
One raspy breath
in, and another out. My fingers wrapped around the bedpost. If he died before
me, right now, Keegan would never forgive me. Whatever it was he had to tell
me, I had to get it out of him quick so Keegan could have his father back.
“Dashiell came
to me, in a dream,” the Holy One said finally.
I parted my lips
to speak, but he shook his head slowly. “I know your people don’t believe. I
know that…that my ancestors have done violent things in his name. But seeing
you…in the Grand Square…”
He fell into a
violent coughing fit. There was a pile of white tissues beside the collection
of remedies on the night table, and I offered him one, but it came back red.
He wiped his
mouth. “My dream…Dashiell, brilliant in white light. He spoke to me. He said, my messenger will put me back together again.
Do you know what this means?”
I shook my head.
“Your name.
Kiera Driscoll.” He pronounced the words slowly, carefully. “In the library, in
the old texts, it says the Driscolls held land by the Forever Sea, near the
western-most tip of this province.” He held up a heavy hand and pointed to a
pile of tomes on the nightstand. “I have been reading about before the war.”
My breath
caught. I found my feet and sauntered to the texts. Information about my
ancestors, before the Marlenian-Freetor war. Not Rordan, nor my father, had
told me anything about what my family had done on the surface. All we’d known,
for two hundred years, was hate. 
I flipped
through the pages. Most of them were faded records and maps of who held what
land, who was the eldest son of whom and what daughter had married what other
lesser lord. Some of the handwriting was so faded that it was impossible to
decipher. But if my family history was in here, then maybe Laoise’s was too,
and all the other Freetors. We would finally know what lands were really ours.
And so would the
Marlenians.
“Most of these
books were destroyed during the war,” the Holy One said. “No one wanted any
record of Freetors holding lands, in case one came to claim them.”
My hand passed
over the leather-bound cover. “What does this have to do with your dream?”
The Holy One
coughed blood again into a tissue clutched tightly in his hand. Even his
eyelids were creased with little wrinkles. I wondered how old he really was.
“Your name. Driscoll. It means, the messenger. Dashiell said, the
messenger will put me back together again.”
“That’s it?” I
knew I was being rude, but I couldn’t help it. 
“The pieces of
Dashiell,” the Holy One said. “You know them.”
I frowned. “I
don’t know--”
“The pieces.” He
was more insistent this time. “The artefacts.”
Yes, I did know
them. The Orb of Dashiell, once held by the Holy One’s sceptre, was safe in my
quarters. That was one of them. 
“The orb. The
cloth. The slab. The spear.” He
hacked more blood.
“I’m calling
Keegan. You need to rest,” I said.
I went for the
door when his powerful voice overcame me. “You must find the spear.”
I stopped, and
turned slowly. “The…Silver Spear?”
“Yes. You know
the story.”
Actually, I didn’t. Not really. There was a myth that Alastar the Hero had travelled to the
end of the Forever Sea and found a spear encased in ice. It was the most
beautiful thing he’d ever seen, and he wanted it, because he could see it was
magic. When he tried to break the ice with his own spells, it shattered and
marred his face. He lost an eye, some said. Others insisted that he played a
game of riddles with a magical tiger guarding the spear and lost, losing his
eye as penance, but still made off with the spear anyway. I didn’t know whether
or not he kept the spear, or whether this happened before or during the war. 
“It’s just a
story,” I said. But even I could hear the uncertainty in my voice.

What do I need the money for?
I am raising $1,000 to cover the editorial cost of publishing the The Silver Spear. This will cover a structural edit and a copy edit from my editor as well as the fees from Indiegogo. If I surpass this goal, the extra money raised will go to the production costs--and if we surpass it by lot, I will be able to do a small offset run.
Why should I contribute to this project?

Publishing is not a sprint. It's a marathon. I went to school for publishing, I work in publishing, and I spend my free time publishing. I will always be a publisher. Here's a little bit more about me, my press & the Silver Spear.
The Violet Fox was on the Winnipeg Bestseller list!

Richard Hatch of Battlestar Galactica fame even bought a copy at KeyCon 2013, which was pretty cool!! :)
The Violet Fox has been on the Amazon bestseller list a time or two as well!
About Faery Ink Press
Faery Ink Press publishes young adult science fiction, fantasy, and horror novels. My novels feature strong, intelligent young women thrust into fantastical circumstances. One fights aliens with her new superhero friends at a secretive university in Northern Alberta. Another fights for her people's freedom to live on the surface in the fantasy land of Marlenia. I aim to publish great looking, smart spec fic that women young and old will enjoy--and stories that will hopefully stay with them for a long time.
Contributing to The Silver Spear gives me the means to continue making beautiful books that people across the country--and the world--have come to enjoy. By publishing my own books, I am taking control of my art, and building something that I hope will outlast me. 

Book Themes
The Violet Fox Series explores three major themes.
1) The definition of freedom
For the first time in over 200 years, the Freetor people have a real shot at returning to their rightful place on the surface. No longer will they be forced to live underground. They are free.
Or are they? Just because the law has been changed, does not mean their freedom is guaranteed. There is no room on the surface for them, and many are too afraid to abandon the caves that they have come to know as home. Others feel that they are not free because those they consider to be their enemy still lives. Many Freetors see the Silver Spear as a symbol of their freedom, as it was the weapon of legend wielded by their ancestor against the Holy One of old, before they were forced underground. If Kiera retrieves it, it will give them the permission--the courage--they desperately seek to live in the sun once more.
The question is: is freedom something that must be given or ordained, or is it something that must be taken by force?
2) Love vs Duty
Kiera, our protagonist, struggles with this in the first book but now faces it head-on in The Silver Spear. She has deep feelings for Prince Keegan and is faced with the very real possibility of being the future queen of the land. But does she really love him, or is she marrying him to give her people a better future? Her feelings for him are tested as they journey together across the world in search of an artefact that may or may not exist--which only heightens the tension between the two of them, for she is dead certain that The Silver Spear does exist, and that it can help them win the inevitable war to come.
3) Prejudice against minorities
This has already been explored in The Violet Fox, but the theme is carried over in The Silver Spear. Prejudice doesn't disappear overnight and we see what happens when Kiera, a Freetor and once considered a Robin Hood figure, is now expected to rule over the people she used to steal from.

<p>A quick update (02-25-2018) for the purposes of Indiegogo's 'In Demand' live campaign  chocolatecake is hopefully with your help and thank you (smile/nudge) trying to reach the stretch goal ($5K) and do a print run in paperback of project '5'. The e-book is funded. Indiegogo's backers can still support by way of contribution the soon to be independently and digitally published creative code in order for it to reach a wider demographic. A <i>futurism-type</i> activity book for the (12-18) YA market (or the child within)</p>
<p>chocolatecake is a moniker for a new writer and hybrid micro-brand</p>
<p><strong>anxiety-crusher</strong><br/>#howhowhow</p>
<p>There are many ways to resonate (a mind path) with the interdimensional constructs of project 5. Transmutational by design. Now one can interact with light emanations decoded as micro-messages from an alternate universe. Ethereal + Holographic. (a hologram of sorts)</p>
<p>Why learn to interact with interstellar codes and re-imagine 'X'?</p>
<p><strong>introduction</strong></p>
<p>What if one suffers from extreme shyness and is highly sensitive (a child or adult) and becomes more and more isolated however well attuned to cosmic energy (whereby one searches for solace) but still feels disconnected from others. Either way depending which side of the spectrum nothing seems to work. The absence of a deep connection to one's inner self or another being eventually over a prolonged and sustained period of time turns to dread. A habitual, nagging and self-deprecating thought form if untreated over years becomes a pathology.</p>
<p><strong>isolation</strong></p>
<p>There are a million variations to counter loneliness but when severe depression leads to despair and hopelessness how do you dispel the onset of chronic mental illness?<br/>The dark state of<i> zero-feels</i> ie no feeling. So how do you even begin to remotely connect (woe-is-me) when neurologically speaking the connections in the brain (synapses) are rendered null and void? F**k you blocked. Are you, really? Yes/No. No/Yes.</p>
<p>Meditation is one way to find the center of self to become less attached to thought forms which requires discipline to basically still the mind. The list of other transcendental or mindful modalities is endless (choose x,y,z)</p>
<p><strong>how-to module</strong></p>
<p>The reverse at-play.<br/>A how-to module utilizes <strong>thinking</strong> (which we all do anyway) and <strong>counting.</strong></p>
<p>- hmm counting that's unusual and only really consciously worked on by K-12 students studying mathematics or related fields of study where numbers have relevance to said exercise and there's nothing special about thinking.</p>
<p><strong>so what is this how-to module?</strong></p>
<p>- to dispel zero-feels when the mind dynamic is at an all time low (yuk moment.) Neurons in the brain search for a connection but there is no memory from the past to draw upon. Zero recall. The 'otherness' escapes one. There is no former bliss point. Unconsciously loneliness is a long drawn out drag drag drag as the future is elusive. A dead end.</p>
<p>There is a way to combat loneliness through a new-format and interactive module to out image the ethereal dimension.  A thought - matrix designed to think <i><strong>it</strong></i> into beingness.</p>
<p><strong>think</strong></p>
<p>Think what? Think light. Encoded emanations to re-imagine the elusive 'otherness'. What form does this take? Tracking 'Never Never Land' or Elysian Fields and/or however one chooses to think of the idea associated with sacred space or divine union (whether mythological or celestial) and how it should read-like, sound-like or be seen-like. ie a self ascribed DIY rendering of a fairy tale or paranormal romance? (kind of)</p>
<p><strong>left-brain + right-brain activation</strong></p>
<p>A visualizer is usually associated with the right-brain. Project 5 is solely a left-brain module<br/>(a tool) to afford one (the reader) a way to trigger the right-brain. Higher consciousness in context to a spiritual awakening from a logic based perspective sounds almost counter intuitive to finding the connection to self. Imagination and creativity is in and of itself simply energy. Unbounded. If the mental body is blocked it can be unblocked - hmm but how? Gently nudged? Noooo!</p>
<p><strong>worked-on </strong></p>
<p>- if the vibration of love in its myriad forms is 'alien' and out of one's life experience decoding a universal light code activates new connections in the brain which prompts the neurons to 'see' as if one is being guided to put the pieces together of a holographic cosmic jigsaw puzzle. A systematic mental rendering of DNA. A rewiring of the senses. Through a series of basic steps (page-by-page) what seemed virtually impossible to begin with becomes possible. This would 'appear' in the mind's eye (as if by magic) to have given rise to a renewed sense of feeling, if only a momentary glimmer of hope.</p>
<p><strong>to re-imagine 'X' by-passes the inability to remember (as remembering is out of the user/reader's experience or state of consciousness)</strong></p>

<p>project 5's interactive how-to module can be accessed simply by reading the e-book as is (or the paperback if funded) and following the number breakdown and/or by interacting with the letters x numbers by counting with one's fingers or counting out aloud and/or in one's mind. Or a mix-and-match approach. The reader could also choose to doodle, scribble or write down the equations on a single piece of paper (or multiples) or jotted down in a basic exercise book or make-up the light encoded equations on a mobile's notepad or calculator. As this can be considered autodidactic the way-in is solely up to the individual.</p>

so what is this how-to module?
- to dispel zero-feels when the mind dynamic is at an all time low (yuk moment.) Neurons in the brain search for a connection but there is no memory from the past to draw upon. Zero recall. The 'otherness' escapes one. There is no former bliss point. Unconsciously loneliness is a long drawn out drag drag drag as the future is elusive. A dead end.
There is a way to combat loneliness through a new-format and interactive module to out image the ethereal dimension.  A thought - matrix designed to think it into beingness.
think
Think what? Think light. Encoded emanations to re-imagine the elusive 'otherness'. What form does this take? Tracking 'Never Never Land' or Elysian Fields and/or however one chooses to think of the idea associated with sacred space or divine union (whether mythological or celestial) and how it should read-like, sound-like or be seen-like. ie a self ascribed DIY rendering of a fairy tale or paranormal romance? (kind of)
left-brain + right-brain activation
A visualizer is usually associated with the right-brain. Project 5 is solely a left-brain module(a tool) to afford one (the reader) a way to trigger the right-brain. Higher consciousness in context to a spiritual awakening from a logic based perspective sounds almost counter intuitive to finding the connection to self. Imagination and creativity is in and of itself simply energy. Unbounded. If the mental body is blocked it can be unblocked - hmm but how? Gently nudged? Noooo!
worked-on 
- if the vibration of love in its myriad forms is 'alien' and out of one's life experience decoding a universal light code activates new connections in the brain which prompts the neurons to 'see' as if one is being guided to put the pieces together of a holographic cosmic jigsaw puzzle. A systematic mental rendering of DNA. A rewiring of the senses. Through a series of basic steps (page-by-page) what seemed virtually impossible to begin with becomes possible. This would 'appear' in the mind's eye (as if by magic) to have given rise to a renewed sense of feeling, if only a momentary glimmer of hope.
to re-imagine 'X' by-passes the inability to remember (as remembering is out of the user/reader's experience or state of consciousness)

deeper connection to selfheightened sense of well-beingacute understanding of unity consciousnessagile mindinner strength (rediscovered)confidence (renewed)energy field (expanded)mind set (positive)approach to life (goal orientated)esoteric knowledge (interest peeked)growth (new found openess)
what form does project 5 take to out image multi-convergent and interconnected codes of light which make up the thought-matrix?
an activity bookDIY exercises (building blocks)journalbasic math bookpuzzle-makeryou + me (reader and writer) learn to #hackstargatesfollow 'X' to enter the 5th dimension
predetermined words which form the non-linear story (in-part a fantasy)whereby one is prompted to exchange letters for their corresponding number valuefollowed by shape-building in the mindby thinking X (transmutational) one enters metaphysical spacethe replication (page-by-page) of a basic math equation links the readerinto a straight forward and comprehensible quantum visualizercounting up numbers from zero to infinitya how-to module to imagine the 5th dimensiona new take on the star system
project 5's interactive how-to module can be accessed simply by reading the e-book as is (or the paperback if funded) and following the number breakdown and/or by interacting with the letters x numbers by counting with one's fingers or counting out aloud and/or in one's mind. Or a mix-and-match approach. The reader could also choose to doodle, scribble or write down the equations on a single piece of paper (or multiples) or jotted down in a basic exercise book or make-up the light encoded equations on a mobile's notepad or calculator. As this can be considered autodidactic the way-in is solely up to the individual.

<p>This project grew out of our <strong>passion for environmental protection</strong> and our <strong>drive to build a sustainable future</strong>.  </p>
<p>Amid the onslaught of disheartening news about the future of our planet, the prospect of taking action on climate change and the energy transition can feel daunting at best. But <strong>the truth is that we are making progress, and recent breakthroughs have made this an exciting period of change</strong>. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>We believe it’s important to communicate a feeling of hope and excitement about the future of the energy transition.</strong> Meaningful change starts when we draw everyone into the discussion – so we invested our personal time, energy, and funds to create a book that does just that. </p>

The first edition of the IETCB won the Gold Award (Criteria Innovative Format) and the Main Award for Climate Change and Environmental Commitment Best Graphic at the prestigious Malofiej Infographic Awards (World Infographic Summit) – ahead of media giants like The New York Times. 
 


 
Featured by:

 
IKEM's Anika Nicolaas Ponder wrote an op-ed article for Medium - ""An energy transition for everyone"". 
 


 
1. Playful comic-style illustrations break down the complexity of the energy transition
The IETCB makes complex climate- and energy-related issues accessible to people of all ages, inspiring engagement and enabling effective action. 

 
2. Colorable infographics debunk myths about renewable energy
The book is packed with expert content based on the most up-to-date statistics from sources including the International Energy Agency (IEA), the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy (BMWi), and the Natural Resources Defense Council. The IETCB covers topics ranging from sustainable mobility to Germany’s Renewable Energy Act and offers recommendations for reducing our carbon footprint. 
Who knew learning about energy subsidies could be so fun? 

 

 
The IETCB is designed to spark dialogue on climate change.
The innovative coloring book format opens doors to new audiences – including change-makers at the top of our government. IETCB team members have personally given coloring books to politicians like Chancellor Angela Merkel and Environment Minister Svenja Schulze.
 
It's your turn: 
The IETCB offers a great way for you to engage with your own local representatives, communities, and decision-makers. The fun illustrations make the book a great ice-breaker. And thanks to the info-packed graphics, it's also an ideal tool for introducing complex climate-related issues. 
With a new, up-to-date edition of the IETCB, we can keep the conversation going!

A book for everyone
The IETCB  is an educational tool, an activity book, and a light-hearted conversation-starter designed to engage, inform, and inspire people of all ages who are curious about climate change and the energy transition. 
 


 
From adults to children!
 


 

 
The IETCB  is the product of a collaboration between two Berlin-based organizations: the Institute for Climate Protection, Energy and Mobility (IKEM) and Ellery Studio for Creative Strategy. The teams joined forces to research, write, and design the first edition of this self-published book.
 
IKEM is an NGO that conducts interdisciplinary research exploring energy transition pathways toward a sustainable society, with an emphasis on the policy framework driving Germany’s Energiewende. 
https://www.ikem.de/en/ 
Ellery Studio for Creative Strategy is an award-winning team of designers and strategists on a mission to boosts creativity and excitement in renewable energy, sustainability and social responsibility.  
https://www.ellerystudio.com
 

 
This project grew out of our passion for environmental protection and our drive to build a sustainable future.  
Amid the onslaught of disheartening news about the future of our planet, the prospect of taking action on climate change and the energy transition can feel daunting at best. But the truth is that we are making progress, and recent breakthroughs have made this an exciting period of change. 
 
We believe it’s important to communicate a feeling of hope and excitement about the future of the energy transition. Meaningful change starts when we draw everyone into the discussion – so we invested our personal time, energy, and funds to create a book that does just that.

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">WHAT IS CRASH PHILOSOPHY?</span></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Hi! My name is Thomas A. Fowler, Author of Nerdy Things. Last year, my publishing company, Nerdy Things Publishing, released Crash Philosophy: First Collision. It had 25 stories, each one a different combination of 5 characters (Alien, Clown, Imaginary Friend, Kaiju, and Robot Assassin) and 5 settings (Apocalyptic Wasteland, Evil Laboratory, Human Mind, the Ocean, and the Triassic). Now, I've gathered 24 new combinations by introducing a Dinosaur and Psycho Killer as characters and Space and an Alternate Future as settings!</span></h3>
<ul>
<li>I've self-published or been published in 13 books now, including the Award-winning Porcelain Prompts Series. Writing since high-school, I've always loved science-fiction and started working with a wide variety of authors to build these anthologies.</li>
<li>This campaign is to help, since over two dozen creative minds had to come together to make Crash Philosophy happen. It's important to me that all of them received author copies, getting paid for their writing. I refused to offer ""experience"" as compensation. But with so many people, this anthology takes a tremendous amount of time and resources, which is why I'm asking for your help.</li>
<li>Your contributions help support the editors, authors, proofreaders, designers, and formators, the literal dozens of incredible contributors who joined me on this journey. Without them, I'd still be banging my head just to get the stories written.</li>
</ul>
<p>So I hope you'll back us, we have levels from an ebook to getting a complete library from a group of the authors who wrote for this anthology, as well as t-shirts and more. Thank you for stopping by and I hope you'll help us crash (in a good way!) once again!</p>

Hi! My name is Thomas A. Fowler, Author of Nerdy Things. Last year, my publishing company, Nerdy Things Publishing, released Crash Philosophy: First Collision. It had 25 stories, each one a different combination of 5 characters (Alien, Clown, Imaginary Friend, Kaiju, and Robot Assassin) and 5 settings (Apocalyptic Wasteland, Evil Laboratory, Human Mind, the Ocean, and the Triassic). Now, I've gathered 24 new combinations by introducing a Dinosaur and Psycho Killer as characters and Space and an Alternate Future as settings!

I've self-published or been published in 13 books now, including the Award-winning Porcelain Prompts Series. Writing since high-school, I've always loved science-fiction and started working with a wide variety of authors to build these anthologies.
This campaign is to help, since over two dozen creative minds had to come together to make Crash Philosophy happen. It's important to me that all of them received author copies, getting paid for their writing. I refused to offer ""experience"" as compensation. But with so many people, this anthology takes a tremendous amount of time and resources, which is why I'm asking for your help.
Your contributions help support the editors, authors, proofreaders, designers, and formators, the literal dozens of incredible contributors who joined me on this journey. Without them, I'd still be banging my head just to get the stories written.

So I hope you'll back us, we have levels from an ebook to getting a complete library from a group of the authors who wrote for this anthology, as well as t-shirts and more. Thank you for stopping by and I hope you'll help us crash (in a good way!) once again!

WHY WE'RE CROWDFUNDING
The time and passion that went into making this happen was exorbitant, by backing this you'll help us do the following:

Pay the huge team that assembled like the Avengers to proofread, format, help with marketing, and most importantly: write the stories.
The perks go from entry-level to t-shirts from the Geeky Gab Podcast and book bundles. You can get both Crash Philosophy installments and add standalone novels from the contributing authors. It's a chance to discover new authors, new stories, and a new reading experience!
We're not doing an ""all-or-nothing"" campaign; as a result, any contributions will go toward the funding necessary to pay authors and experts helping make Crash Philosophy come to life and ""expand the portal"" to add new characters and settings.

 

THE DIFFERENCE YOU'LL MAKE

The contributing authors vary from published authors with several credits to their name to this being an aspiring writer's first publication! By backing this campaign, you're literally helping people's dreams come true.
You'll also help us continue building a new reading experience! This anthology's success will let us continue introducing new characters and settings, constantly making this an evolving literary world we can experience before.
At this point, the stories are gathered, edited, and the cover is done. As a result, your support is to champion us to the finish line, which we've done already with the First Collision. We'd love for you to help us with it all.

RISKS & CHALLENGES

Because I've already released the first installment of this anthology, it would take drastic action for this anthology not to come together. We're quite far into the editing process so all stories are gathered and being refined while the campaign launches.

My day job is Project Management in advertising, which requires constant evolving to challenges and finding ways to make things work within budget. As a result, even if we don't hit our goal, the project will still see the light of day!
One of the biggest risks is time. However, now that I've been through the process of self-publishing several times, our release of late May should be feasible unless I end up having a rough injury or both my main folder, and backup, disappear without explanation.


OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP
Money can be tight at times, believe me, as a father of four I get that. I wish I could back all of my author friends. If you like the idea of this project, but cannot back us, there's still plenty you can do to help:

Share the campaign on social! Spread the word to help us get discovered by awesome readers like you!
The campaign has easy share tools on IndieGoGo.
You can sign up for our newsletter. Alongside my Geeky Gab podcast host, Melissa Koons, we have a monthly newsletter where you can receive updates on new books and projects, as well as free ways to interact, come see us at conventions, and such. We do quarterly giveaways so you may even win a signed copy of Crash Philosophy! Sign up here.

Thank you so much for any support you can give. You're helping dozens of writers and creators expand a reading experience the world hasn't really seen yet. Thank you for coming along and helping us!",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Try, Catch is the story of a young engineer trying to fit into life in the Bay Area after graduation.</strong><br/><br/>Hello and welcome to my Indiegogo Campaign! My name is David Cantu and I am the author of Try, Catch, a comedic book set in the Bay Area, California, that follows the wacky and unpredictable life of a young software engineer following his life after graduation. I wrote this book because of my own personal experiences being a recent graduate myself working and living in the Silicon Valley. It goes without saying that everyone has their own experiences with adjusting to life after graduation and their first jobs, but I hope that people can relate, and laugh, with the characters in the book as they navigate through life, in an seemingly endless stream of bad luck.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, people will be able to relate with my characters and have a laugh. I want anyone who reads it to see it as an opportunity in their lives to laugh, escape from all the things that are happening in the world, and accompany the main character in the book in his journey through life after graduation and subsequent descent into relative insanity.<br/><br/>John Buntington is a recently graduated software engineer living in the Bay Area, California, that is suddenly faced with the realities of corporate America, whilst enduring the general absurdities that come with the region. The dream to work for a big tech company, thrive, and learn is not necessarily what he encounters when he moves out west to follow the “correct” path of a software engineer. He slowly but surely realizes that he himself has still a lot of growing and adjusting to real life. He also begins to see that corporate life, regardless of the fact that it’s the tech industry, an industry which is nationally known to be progressive, efficient, and a fun environment, is not entirely what it’s played out to be in the media or testimonials. Alongside some of his newly made friends, Carson, Luis Filipe, and Neveah, John goes through a series of hilarious experiences that slowly but surely change his perspective on the Bay Area and force him to make irrational, and hilarious, decisions throughout the book.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll encounter multifaceted dimensions of comedy, software engineering, and life after graduation through narratives like:</p>
<ul>
<li>At a certain point, my main character decides to go to Yosemite, which is a very calm and beautiful place near the Bay Area that is a must. Once he’s there, he is able to appreciate this fact, but at the same time, Yosemite is not empty. It’s in fact filled with other humans, some of which happen to be very interesting characters. Everybody knows that every much-needed planned trip always goes exactly according to plan. Right? Right...</li>
<li>John loses the key to his apartment after an unfortunate series of events, so he has to go replace it. No decent place will replace his key, as it’s a “special” key. Therefore, he has to go out of his way and find the “Key Man”, who is able to help him replace his lost key. The “Key Man” turns out to be a hilarious character full of opinions on what’s happening to his hometown.</li>
<li>John, Carson, Neveah, and Luis Filipe, attend a party in San Francisco where they experience first-hand what it is to go to a young, college-graduate-aged house party. The story begins with John showing up late to the party. Slowly, through time hops and gentle revealing, you will learn all about John’s night that did not go exactly how he wanted it to go.</li>
</ul>
<br/>You live in the bay area, you work or have worked in tech, recently graduated from school, or if you’re just a fan of comedy and want to be taken for a ride, then this is the book for you.<br/><br/>Try, Catch speaks to Software Engineers and lovers of comedy. Anyone who wants to be taken for an emotional rollercoaster is welcomed aboard.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Try, Catch inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:<p>Am I alone in feeling this way about life after graduation? Is the Silicon Valley the promised land?</p>
</div><p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing life after graduation and working in corporate will change us all for the better.</p><h2><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></h2><p><br/>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

Bolt Moment</i> is merely a starting point. Most people know the story well
about how J.K. Rowling came up with the idea for Harry Potter on a train ride
from Manchester to London. For me, my bolt of lightning was not so obvious, at
least not initially. I met my muse during the fall semester of my sophomore
year of college. I was taking public speaking at the time and our latest
assignment was to write an informative speech. We were allowed to choose
anything as a topic and being that it was October, I thought it would be fun to
talk about the history of Halloween.<p>

</p><p style=""margin:0in 0in 0pt;line-height: 150%;"">I researched the
topic online and to my surprise I did not have to dig far because the
History Channel already had its Halloween spread active. Combing through the
information, I came across the history of the Jack O’ Lantern and learned that
the practice stems from an Irish folktale about a man named Stingy Jack. As the
story goes, Stingy Jack tricked the Devil twice, each time making a deal, that
if he should die, the Devil could not take his soul. When Jack died, God would
not let such an unsavory character into heaven and true to his word, the Devil
did not claim Jack’s soul. <span style=""background:white;color: black;"">From that
day on, Jack was doomed to roam the earth, with only piece of coal inside a

</p><p style=""margin:0in 0in 0pt;line-height: 150%;"">From there, I
tried to learn more about this Stingy Jack, but no other stories were written
about him, nor could I find the true origins of his Irish folktale. It
fascinated me, the lack of information about this ill-fated character, confused
why no one would have written a story about his wanderings, although one might
claim Tim Burton already did in <i>A Nightmare Before Christmas</i>. But I was
not looking for the Pumpkin King. I wanted to know what a mortal soul would do
with its eternity. Could Stingy Jack fall in love? Would the Devil still be
trying to beat his now immortal foe? Could Stingy Jack change his ways? Could
he be granted a reprieve and be allowed into heaven? I wanted to know! And in
order to know, I had to write his story. But it would take five years before 
Stingy Jack and I would meet again and another eight before the first story,
which actually doesn’t feature Stingy Jack, was polished enough to get off the
ground. </p><p>

My name is James Hoffmann. I've been writing about coffee online since 2004 at jimseven.com. In 2014 I published The World Atlas of Coffee. I was the World Barista Champion in 2007, and I cofounded Square Mile Coffee Roasters in 2008.
I've written hundreds of posts online, and I wanted to take the best of them, to organise them, lay them out properly and create a compilation of my writing that people could enjoy in hardback form.

<p>Hi! My name is J.W. Galliger and I'm the author of <i>The Terminal Code</i>. I wrote this book because for as long as I can remember, my dream has been to be an author. This book is my latest attempt at fulfilling that dream.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you'll think more about how technology, while powerful, can often be dangerous or exploited in the wrong hands. But ultimately, I want this book to be an escape into a world full of exciting characters, settings and of course mystery, action and adventure.<br/><br/>My story takes place in 2050 - NYC. A city that's been transformed by the advent of a virtual reality system, known as SCAPE. SCAPE is so incredible, so life-like, so amazing that many have abandoned the real world for the pleasure of the virtual. But, as society has shifted, so has crime. Our protagonist Dashiel Kincaid, a cocky security consultant known for his prowess and knowledge of SCAPE's systems, and fixing problems within them, is called to the scene of a murder. A murder that turns out to be much more than it seems - one that has crossed the bounds of SCAPE into real life. His quest for the truth reveals a deeper conspiracy. One that causes him to question the nature of his society, reality and even himself.<br/><br/>You'll love this book if you're a sci-fi or mystery buff, or if you're looking for a literary escape on a rainy Sunday afternoon.</p>

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<i>The Wisdom of Guncles </i>is about queer people and our relationship with family – however we choose to define it. Featuring a diverse pantheon of gay uncles (“guncles”) and other queer mentors, their stories offer powerful perspectives about life, love, and personal empowerment. From unpacking the role of the “black sheep” in challenging traditions to examining what the journey of coming out teaches us about self-discovery and transformation, this book is about the evolution, affirmation, and resilience of identity. It is anchored on the human journey of uncovering, covering, and recovering one’s truth. It is about all that may encumber, enable and enlighten our path to personhood and the wisdom that accumulates.<br/><br/>My name is Michael Dumlao, and I am the author of <i>The Wisdom of Guncles: Stories and Advice on Living Life from a Queer Perspective</i>. I wrote this book to explore the relationships between “Guncles” or “gay uncles” and our beloved niblings (the gender-neutral term for nieces and nephews), godchildren, baby cousins, and anyone younger who we might consider our proteges. And in doing so, I discovered that there is something truly unique about the lived queer experience that offers the world special examples, ideas and insights—wisdom, if you will—about what it means to live life with authenticity and compassion on your own terms.<br/><br/>My hope for this book is that it honors these uniquely queer and profoundly human stories that are not always told. My hope is that it becomes a resource for inspiration for those seeking advice about how to live their most authentic selves.<br/><br/>In this book, you’ll learn about the shift in the construct of family (especially the growing prevalence of chosen families) and what it means to be a disruptor in a family—someone who interrupts archaic practices and toxic patterns of behavior that keep us from reaching our potential. Stories such as these showcase how each Guncle desires to build a better world: <br/> <ul>
<li>From the non-binary drag artist from Paraguay who plays with gender and empowers their niece to come out as queer</li>
<li>To the African-American wheelchair-using academic from Ohio who wants his god-daughter to understand the joy of travel</li>
<li>To the trans masculine cosplayer in Atlanta who wants to create a world that empowers their protégé to explore who they are</li>
<li>To my own story of being the rainbow sheep of my family who grew up under martial law in the Philippines, immigrated to Australia, then moved across the United States to become a safe harbor and mentor to young people who felt they didn’t belong</li>
</ul>
<br/>You will love this book if you are a fellow Guncle and queer mentor—as well as a Guncles-in-waiting. I hope you see your self, your experience, and your relationships reflected in these stories. This book is also for you, our beloved protégés, so you can see how much you are affirmed and seen.<br/><br/>These stories are for people who chafe against tradition and norms and seek examples of dismantling and redefining them. Those of us who never fit in, who can’t help but stand out, and yearn for evidence that there is magic in resilience, comfort in transformation, and power in challenging the immovable.  <br/><br/> <h2>The Book - <i>The Wisdom of Guncles</i>
</h2>The book is written according to 10 archetypes of hard-won wisdoms, reflections, and cautionary tales reflective of the lived queer narrative: <br/> <ul>
<li>
<strong>The Black Sheep</strong> offers an introduction to the underlying premise of how queer people’s role as the perpetual black sheep or outcasts of a family offers them unique perspectives. From challenging traditions to disrupting toxic patterns of behavior, this chapter explores how queer mentors help families and communities become more inclusive and equitable. <br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>The Bridge </strong>offers how my own story as a gay, Filipino immigrant who has lived and thrived on three continents makes me uniquely qualified to bridge cultures, histories, and ideas. I demonstrate this through my role as a guardian to two female, biracial (half-Filipino, half-Black) cousins who grapple with their intersectional identities.  <br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>The Brother </strong>offers the story of a gay Peruvian immigrant and their close relationship with their decade-younger sister and her biracial daughter. His story demonstrates the power in questioning authority and institutions, and why young people must be equipped to decide their destiny for themselves.  <br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>The Explorer</strong> offers the story of a gay, disabled, wheelchair-using African-American academic from Ohio who travels the world to escape prejudice and ultimately find his true self. He is the god-father to a young, biracial woman in whom he wants to instill the love for exploration. <br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>The Pioneer </strong>offers the story of a gay immigrant from Venezuela who escapes turmoil by coming to America. Here he establishes a new life and community that becomes a safe harbor for his niece, who looks to her guncle’s life-lessons on resilience and self-reliance as she navigates life as an undocumented student. <br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>The Nerd </strong>offers the story of a pansexual, transgender cosplayer from Atlanta who found the love, affirmation, and support they lacked from their abusive parents in their cosplay, fan convention, and choral communities. As a god-parent, they created a safe space for their god-child to come out. Their story proves the power and integrity of chosen families.  <br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>The Alchemist</strong> offers the story of a queer, non-binary drag artist from Paraguay who suffered their immigrant parents' disappointment that they will never be the “golden child.” An artist who dismantles gender-norms, they created the safe-space they never had to embolden their niece to come out. <br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>The Beacon</strong> offers the story of an engaged gay couple whose same-sex relationship has become their many niblings’ only example of relationship stability. One comes from a Catholic family in Boston, the other a conservative Christian family in Maryland. Their story teaches that love is love.  <br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>The Chameleon</strong> offers the story of a bisexual, African-American, non-binary, Army veteran from Alaska who has decided to never dim their light ever again after a lifetime of code-switching and a family legacy of hiding queer members. Their inspiring story of assertive authenticity becomes a beacon for their niblings and siblings to live their truth.  <br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>The Patriarch </strong>offers the story of a queer, retired government worker in New York City who survived the AIDS crisis then became the leader of a family who has yet to know his full truth. This story honors the stories of all our secretly queer uncles and aunties who were hidden away but inspired future generations to create a world where everyone can come into the light. </li>
</ul> <h2>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h2>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<p>The editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in August, 2021</p>

International PreordersFor international preorders, please send me a private message. Risks & ChallengesThe biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by including the cost of mailing and shipping the signed copies into each pre-order tier. The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we ship the pre-order rewards to you as early as possible. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as to when my book will publish. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship. Other Ways You Can Help

<h3><i>The Short Scoop!</i></h3>
<p>Welcome to the crowdfunder for my new novel <strong>“The Motorcycle &amp; The Molecule”!</strong> The book was inspired by a solo research expedition to explore alternative communities in Central America  and transports readers from the deep wilderness of Oregon to the jungles of Costa Rica. <i>Join me on the adventure and you will:</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Discover an array of unforgettable characters, unconventional communities and uncomfortable ceremonies.</li>
<li>Get introduced to Mayan rulers, mischievous beavers and mind-bending molecules.</li>

Other members of the team include Nuno, Andreia and Hugo who have lent a much needed hand.Nuno and Hugo have vast editorial experience, across more than 40 children's and educational books - as authors or publishers. Andreia is a Graphic Designer and has been making books with us for more than five years. Our team is spread between Alcobaça, Lisbon and London. It was U2's frontman Bono Vox who said :“Pop music often tells you everything is OK, while rock music tells you that it's not OK, but you can change it. There's a defiance in rock music that gives you a reason to get out of bed in the morning. Most pop music doesn't make you want to get out of bed, I'm sorry to say. It puts you to sleep.”Rock music and artists can teach our children valuable lessons they could never get from much of the music currently playing on the radio or found in popular playlists. The obstacles that many rock legends have had to overcome in order to follow their passion and became successful provide great lessons for young readers.That´s why we mention the difficult childhood Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash, Jimi Hendrix or Neil Young had; or how Jerry Lee Lewis' family had to sell their house allong with an enormous ammount of eggs to help launch Jerry's career; the way female musicians, like Janis Joplin, had to overcome gender bias; and the very harsh conditions some of the greatest blues pioneers were brought up while working the cotton fields.If children should learn one lesson from our book, we hope it is that music, especially Rock music, can save and give meaning to one´s life. We ship worldwide. In order to keep these shipping costs affordable, we will keep the book weight + package under 500 grams (approx. 17.5 oz), reducing both the cost and the CO2 emissions from the transportation.Also, we have a universal Flat Shipping Rate of £5 (roughly $6.5 USD  or €5,7) for each book purchased.",20.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>     My name is <strong>April Wahlin</strong> and I've finally published my first novel '<strong>The Centennial ~Short Stories of Ithiria</strong>' on Amazon! </p>
<p>     Now comes the hard part, getting it to my audience. Lifetime banners on Facebook cost hundreds of dollars, editing runs in the thousands, and traveling costs to promote can add up pretty fast. Let alone the cost of printing copies for book sellers.</p>
<p>     What is a first time, independently published novelist to do? <br/>     Indiegogo!</p>
<p>     So here I am, relying on the kindness of strangers to get this book out of the endless depths of Amazon listings and into peoples hands.</p>
<p><br/><strong>My Series</strong>:</p>
<p>     'The Centennial ~Short Stories of Ithiria' is the first in a long series of fantasy fiction novels I am writing. These books span the fictional gaps to encompass magic, technology, modern times, and medieval.</p>
<p>     The world of Ithiria features many different lands. Lands of magic creatures, electric wonders, oddball inventors, gods, and fearsome monsters. The tales themselves are full of great adventures, epic battles, bumbling sidekicks, brave heroes, and surprising romances.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary of my first fantasy novella now available on Amazon and Kindle: </strong><br/>'The Centennial ~Short Stories of Ithiria':<br/>     It has been one hundred years to the day since the brothers Voodoo last met in the land of Hollywood. From all across the world of Ithiria they have come with tales of weary navigators, fearsome monsters, and ancient creatures. However, with unstable magics wreaking havoc in their home lands, only a few of the brothers are able to make the trip. Between interruptions from the fates and delayed siblings, they struggle to present the thirteen tales needed to revitalize their guardianship of Ithiria.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>     If you would like to know more about the series, I have listed some basic story information below along with descriptions of the other novels I have written. I very much hope to edit, publish, and promote all these stories with the help of this campaign.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Background of Ithiria:</strong></p>
<p>     Ithiria is a world much like our Earth, with whole continents and all species of people. I created this place to encompass our mythologies: from Christian and Indian stories to Greek Mythology and Fairy Tales. Here they all exist and interact with one another in precarious magical lands. <br/>     These lands have broken apart into their own continents due to a war which separated them with an influx of magic and electricity. However, they are all still very much a part of the same world and timeline—whether they are aware of one another or not. <br/>     The individual lands are in an enlightened and experimental period where continents rich in electric current are discovering magic reverberations and vise versa.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Here are just a few land examples:</strong></p>
<p>     Old World is a land where all the characters from Grimm’s Fairy Tales and Hans Christian Anderson clash, complete with majestic castles, great villages, and of course ominous and enchanted forests. Magic flourishes here and provides people with access to simple and fearsome spells alike, as well as bewitched objects like magic mirrors and wands.</p>
<p><br/>     The Industrial Domain is a land of cobblestone streets and glass lanterns that would make Sherlock Holmes feel perfectly at home. It is a place of new science and technology, where boats sail into the sky and Tesla-inspired gadgets are an aspect of everyday life. However, the underbelly of this old new world is akin to Jack the Ripper’s: any number of ill tidings can befall unescorted passersby.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>     Gods Grace is a Mythology-based land where the Gods have gone to retire from their terrifying exploits in the Vacant Realm. Gods Grace is a great mountainous land mass which humbles Mount Olympus and is surrounded by seas so ferocious and full of beasts that Poseidon will never want for anywhere else. It is a land of almost pure magic where the clouds themselves are tread upon.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Other Works:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Ithiria</strong>: An Epic Adventure Novel<br/>     This epic journey through the beginnings of Ithiria follows a young Princess with deep ties into the very heart of Ithiria. With the help of forest rogues, gypsies, and others like herself, she fights to defeat an evil queen determined to destroy the lands and all those within.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Rayne in the Black Wood: </strong>A Young Adult Novel</p>
<p>     Rayne, a newly turned sixteen year old from Old World, attempts to attend a prestigious public school after being home-schooled all her life. When assigned a class project on the social aspects of their land after all the good subjects are taken, she and her miscreant friends turn to the bad. Determined to ace the project, Rayne leads her friends into the dangerous Black Woods, full of terrible monsters and horrific spells. However, upon entering, they quickly find that the bad guys are not as bad as they thought and the good guys are not as good.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Pandora Syndrome: </strong>A Supernatural Horror Comedy Novel</p>
<p>     Pandora Blackheart is having the worst twenty-first birthday in history: not only has she been left behind by her friends, she has woken up in a stranger’s bed with a terrible craving for blood. In this quirky comedic horror novel, Pandora must adjust to her new life as a blood sucker. Unfortunately, once she seems to get the hang of it, an undead force comes to challenge her. Wanting nothing more than to sit and play video games, she finds herself wrapped up in a deadly plot encompassing her past, present, and future.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Persephone</strong>: A Seafaring Fantasy Novel</p>
<p>     This story is of Moira McLandon, a sea captain’s daughter who is stolen into slavery and forced to fight her way to freedom. When dressed as a boy to escape her slavers, she crosses paths with a duo of cargo-stealing pirates, who have more on their mind than simple thievery. Moira transforms into the illustrious Captain McBane and follows the lead of her mentor on adventures which take her across countless seas, through the grips of monsters, and into the very jaws of death.</p>

<h2>Voces libertarias: Los orígenes históricos del anarquismo en Puerto Rico</h2>
<h3>""A book about the history of Puerto Rican radicalism and anarchism""</h3>
<p>My name is Jorell A. Meléndez Badillo. I'm an independent scholar interested in the history of radical ideas. I am also a history teacher by trade, an anarchist by conviction, and a punk rock singer for kicks. I've published several articles on the history of anarchism in Puerto Rico and I've presented on the topic in different spaces in Canada, United States, United Kingdom, and Puerto Rico. I was one of the organizers of the 3rd Annual North American Anarchist Studies Network Conference in San Juan and I'm currently an active member of the Coléctivo Autónomo C.C.C., which runs a Centro Social/Infoshop in the town of Santurce (<a href=""http://www.infoshopsanturce.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.infoshopsanturce.wordpress.com</a>). </p>
<p>I am trying to gather funds in order to publish a research that I've been doing for the past three years. Originally, it was a M.A. thesis project called ""El anarquismo en Puerto Rico: Su influencia en la cultura proletaria puertorriqueña durante las primeras dos décadas del siglo XX"". Its aim was to make a contribution to the history of radical ideas in Puerto Rico by presenting anarchism as a historical reality, contrary to what was presented by official Puerto Rican historiography which dealt with the topic from a distance. <br/><br/>The publication of this book will help expand the field of anarchist studies in the island and would open a space for a Puerto Rican anarchist historiography. Given the nature of the project, the ideas presented in it, and my own ideological concerns, the funds gathered here would help me publish it in the spirit of D.I.Y. (do-it-yourself) politics. My friend Chris Clavin will help distribute the book on his ""Secret Sailor Books"". </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>The first run would be of 250 copies. The printing house I've consulted charges $3.93 for each copy (softcover + black&amp;white) = $982.50. This quantity does not include shipping &amp; handling nor the cost of setting up the book and other trivialities. That's what the extra $217.50 (minus $84 for the IndieGogo charges) are for. </p>
<p>With your funds not only will you be helping in the construction of a collective history of anarchism on the island, that will be of crucial importance in building an encompassing movement, but you will get a few perks in return of your solidarity (not charity). You will get stuff from zines published by our own Colectivo Autónomo C.C.C. to posters, thanks, and/or a night out in San Juan (when in the area). <br/><br/>If the goal is not met, even though my heart will be broken, you will still get your perks (not including the book), and I will save the money until I get enough to publish it. Once I do, the people who were getting a book will do so. <br/><br/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>In the spirit of mutual aid and solidarity, which is the backbone of the anarchist ideology, you can also help in other ways that do not necessarily include money.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can tell your friends about the nascent anarchist movement on the island.</li>
<li>You can send letters to the Colectivo Autónomo C.C.C.</li>
<li>You can go out and create your own radical projects and/or researches.</li>
<li>You can invite a few friends over, cook a meal, skip work, and engage in real conversations with real people.</li>
<li>Go out.</li>
<li>Meet your neighbors.</li>
<li>Create allies and know your enemies.</li>
<li>Fall madly in love to fuel your rage.</li>
<li><strong>Organize.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Voces libertarias: Los orígenes históricos del anarquismo en Puerto Rico</h2>
<h3>""Un libro sobre el radicalismo y el anarquismo en Puerto Rico""</h3>
<p>Mi nombre es Jorell A. Meléndez Badillo. Soy un investigador independiente interesado en ideas radicales, también soy maestro de profesión, anarquista por convicción y un punk rocker por diversión. He publicado varios artículos relacionados a la historia del anarquismo en Puerto Rico y, además, los he presentado en diferentes espacios en Canadá, Reino Unido, Estados Unidos y Puerto Rico. Fui uno de los organizadores de la <em>3ra Conferencia Anual del North American Anarchist Studies Network</em> en San Juan y actualmente soy un miembro activo del Colectivo Autónomo C.C.C., el cual corre un Centro Social/Infoshop en la Santurce (<a href=""http://www.infoshopsanturce.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.infoshopsanturce.wordpress.com</a>).</p>
<p>Al momento estoy tratando de recopilar fondos para poder publicar una investigación la cual he ido desarrollando en los últimos tres años. Originalmente fue una tesis para el nivel de maestría bajo el nombre de “El anarquismo en Puerto Rico: Su influencia en la cultura proletaria puertorriqueña durante las primeras dos décadas del siglo XX”. Su propósito era hacer una contribución a la historia de las ideas radicales en Puerto Rico al presentar el anarquismo como una realidad histórica, contrario a lo que ha sido presentado por la historiografía oficial puertorriqueña la cual ha tratado el tema desde cierta distancia. La publicación de este libro ayudará a expandir el campo de los estudios anarquistas en la isla mientras que abrirá un espacio para una historiografía anarquista puertorriqueña. Debido a la naturaleza del proyecto, el de las ideas presentadas en el mismo y mi posturas ideológicas, los fondos que sean recopilados me ayudarán a publicar la investigación en el espíritu del D.I.Y. (acrónimo en inglés para Hazlo Tú Mismo).</p>
<h3>Lo que necesitamos y lo que recibirás</h3>
<p>La primera tirada será de 250 copias. La imprenta consultada cobrará $3.93 por cada copia (carpeta suave + blanco/negro) = $982.50. Esta cantidad no incluye manejo y envío, como tampoco los costos de editar, formatear, junto a otras trivialidades. Para esto se utilizarán los $217.50 (menos $84 que cobra IndieGoGo por sus servicios) que sobran.</p>
<p>Con tus fondos no solo estarías ayudando en la construcción de una historia anarquista colectiva en la isla, sino que también será de crucial importancia para la creación de un movimiento inclusivo sino que también te llevarás algunos regalos en cambio por tu solidaridad (no caridad). Podrás obtener desde zines publicados por el Colectivo Autónomo C.C.C. hasta posters, gracias, y/o una noche en el área de San Juan (cuando estés en el área). Si la meta no se cumple, aunque se me rompa el corazón, todavía se enviarán los regalos (con excepción del libro) y el dinero será guardado hasta poder agrupar los suficiente para poder publicarlo. Una vez se publique, se enviarán copias del libro a aquellos que se les debía.</p>
<h3>Otras formas de ayudar</h3>
<p>En el espíritu de apoyo mutuo y solidaridad, que son la espina dorsal de la ideología anarquista, también puedes ayudar en otras formas que no necesariamente incluyen dinero.</p>
<ul>
<li>Puedes decirles a tus amigxs sobre al naciente movimiento anarquista en la isla.</li>
<li>Puedes salir y crear tus propios proyectos/investigaciones radicales.</li>
<li>Puedes invitar algunos amigxs, faltar al trabajo y crear conversaciones reales con personas reales.</li>
<li>Sal afuera.</li>
<li>Conoce tus vecinxs.</li>
<li>Crea alianzas y conoce tus enemigxs.</li>
<li>Enamórate locamente para alimentar tu rabia.</li>
<li><strong>Organízate. </strong></li>
</ul>

You will get stuff from zines published by our own Colectivo Autónomo C.C.C. to posters, thanks, and/or a night out in San Juan (when in the area). If the goal is not met, even though my heart will be broken, you will still get your perks (not including the book), and I will save the money until I get enough to publish it. Once I do, the people who were getting a book will do so. 


Other Ways You Can Help
In the spirit of mutual aid and solidarity, which is the backbone of the anarchist ideology, you can also help in other ways that do not necessarily include money.

You can tell your friends about the nascent anarchist movement on the island.
You can send letters to the Colectivo Autónomo C.C.C.
You can go out and create your own radical projects and/or researches.
You can invite a few friends over, cook a meal, skip work, and engage in real conversations with real people.
Go out.
Meet your neighbors.
Create allies and know your enemies.
Fall madly in love to fuel your rage.
Organize.

Voces libertarias: Los orígenes históricos del anarquismo en Puerto Rico
""Un libro sobre el radicalismo y el anarquismo en Puerto Rico""
Mi nombre es Jorell A. Meléndez Badillo. Soy un investigador independiente interesado en ideas radicales, también soy maestro de profesión, anarquista por convicción y un punk rocker por diversión. He publicado varios artículos relacionados a la historia del anarquismo en Puerto Rico y, además, los he presentado en diferentes espacios en Canadá, Reino Unido, Estados Unidos y Puerto Rico. Fui uno de los organizadores de la 3ra Conferencia Anual del North American Anarchist Studies Network en San Juan y actualmente soy un miembro activo del Colectivo Autónomo C.C.C., el cual corre un Centro Social/Infoshop en la Santurce (www.infoshopsanturce.wordpress.com).
Al momento estoy tratando de recopilar fondos para poder publicar una investigación la cual he ido desarrollando en los últimos tres años. Originalmente fue una tesis para el nivel de maestría bajo el nombre de “El anarquismo en Puerto Rico: Su influencia en la cultura proletaria puertorriqueña durante las primeras dos décadas del siglo XX”. Su propósito era hacer una contribución a la historia de las ideas radicales en Puerto Rico al presentar el anarquismo como una realidad histórica, contrario a lo que ha sido presentado por la historiografía oficial puertorriqueña la cual ha tratado el tema desde cierta distancia. La publicación de este libro ayudará a expandir el campo de los estudios anarquistas en la isla mientras que abrirá un espacio para una historiografía anarquista puertorriqueña. Debido a la naturaleza del proyecto, el de las ideas presentadas en el mismo y mi posturas ideológicas, los fondos que sean recopilados me ayudarán a publicar la investigación en el espíritu del D.I.Y. (acrónimo en inglés para Hazlo Tú Mismo).
Lo que necesitamos y lo que recibirás
La primera tirada será de 250 copias. La imprenta consultada cobrará $3.93 por cada copia (carpeta suave + blanco/negro) = $982.50. Esta cantidad no incluye manejo y envío, como tampoco los costos de editar, formatear, junto a otras trivialidades. Para esto se utilizarán los $217.50 (menos $84 que cobra IndieGoGo por sus servicios) que sobran.
Con tus fondos no solo estarías ayudando en la construcción de una historia anarquista colectiva en la isla, sino que también será de crucial importancia para la creación de un movimiento inclusivo sino que también te llevarás algunos regalos en cambio por tu solidaridad (no caridad). Podrás obtener desde zines publicados por el Colectivo Autónomo C.C.C. hasta posters, gracias, y/o una noche en el área de San Juan (cuando estés en el área). Si la meta no se cumple, aunque se me rompa el corazón, todavía se enviarán los regalos (con excepción del libro) y el dinero será guardado hasta poder agrupar los suficiente para poder publicarlo. Una vez se publique, se enviarán copias del libro a aquellos que se les debía.
Otras formas de ayudar
En el espíritu de apoyo mutuo y solidaridad, que son la espina dorsal de la ideología anarquista, también puedes ayudar en otras formas que no necesariamente incluyen dinero.

Puedes decirles a tus amigxs sobre al naciente movimiento anarquista en la isla.
Puedes salir y crear tus propios proyectos/investigaciones radicales.
Puedes invitar algunos amigxs, faltar al trabajo y crear conversaciones reales con personas reales.
Sal afuera.
Conoce tus vecinxs.
Crea alianzas y conoce tus enemigxs.
Enamórate locamente para alimentar tu rabia.

It is a connection from the cheers for the professionals in stadiums, to the smiles of children in dusty playgrounds. Most of these people are native Africans, but an increasing number are North Americans volunteering to teach children the sport of soccer, and related life lessons. Thousands of people are doing it every year through more than two dozen organizations, and thousands more will do it in years to come. South Africa has been a center of soccer activity over the past few years, and that focus will sharpen once more as it prepares for the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations which it hosts from January 19 - February 10 2013. Within its great cities, still buzzing from the vuvuzelas of the World Cup, anticipation of this event is growing.</p>
<p>This is a three phase project:</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> I will conduct interviews with North Americans who are actually in Africa volunteering their time to teach children soccer through such organizations as: <a href=""http://www.projects-abroad.ca/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Projects Abroad</a>, <a href=""http://www.volunteerhq.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">International Volunteer HQ</a>, <a href=""http://www.grassrootsoccer.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Grassroot Soccer</a>, <a href=""http://www.crossculturalsolutions.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cross Cultural Solutions</a>, <a href=""http://www.africanimpact.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">African Impact</a>, and a number of others. This will be an opportunity to have a series of articles that show how we, ordinary citizens of North America, can positively affect the world around us. Africa has also become a hotbed of talent with the likes of Didier Drogba, Samuel Eto’o, Yaya Toure and many others making an impact in world soccer. I wish to show the connection from dusty African playgrounds staffed by American volunteers, to the premier stadiums of World soccer.<br/><br/><strong>2)</strong> I will examine how a local African soccer league operates. <a href=""http://www.psl.co.za/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Premier Soccer League</a> (PSL) is South Africa's top soccer league. I will look at how it operates under its strict rules of only allowing five foreign born players per team by closely following <a href=""http://www.ajaxct.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ajax Cape Town</a>. I will interview coaches, players, front office staff, and most importantly the fans, to gauge what makes this young league work as well as it does.

<h3>This is me...</h3>
<p>I'm Laura, I'm an author and first time illustrator of children's books from the Hunter Valley, NSW in Australia. I knew I wanted to 'write books' when I was seven, and read my first novel. I would scribble stories on any sheet of paper I could get my hands on, and back in the 90s, I would enjoy my share of computer time (my brothers and I got an hour each at a time so everyone got a turn) typing up my little stories and creating strange and wonderful characters who became like friends to me. </p>
<p>I've read a lot of books in my life, each one has impacted on my life, and it's that desire and that passion for impact that has driven me to write and publish my own stories. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why Picture Books?</h3>
<p>Early literacy is a huge passion of mine, and I've worked with my own children to instil a love of books from very early on. There is tons of research out there about how beneficial it can be to share books with children, even from birth like my own children have experienced. It can help foster a lifelong love of books, and sharing a picture book can be a great way to forge relationships and connections. </p>
<p>Evangeline's Moon is my second independently published picture book, the first Our Mum is Fun was released in 2017, and inspired by the crazy, funny, and sweet things that I enjoy doing with my children. </p>
<p>So I guess this is the part where I give you the pitch, and tell you about my own book Evangeline's Moon. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Evangeline's Moon was inspired by my daughter's obsession with the moon. Over a period of months we built up almost a mythology about the moon and how she was magic, and watched over us. But we could never reach her, which became the inspiration for this story. </p>
<ul>
<li>To make this book a reality, I need your help. My goal for this campaign is $1500. What this gets is:</li>
<li>100 copies printed in gorgeous hardcover of Evangeline's Moon</li>
<li>Shipping/postage/reward generation for books and other goodies sold via the campaign </li>
<li>Admin costs/ISBN and barcodes and Indiegogo fees covered.</li>
<li>Modest marketing budget.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to being able to be amongst the first to get your hands on a copy of Evangeline's Moon, you'll also have the opportunity to get prints of illustrations, stickers, postcards, and even an author visit within the Newcastle/Hunter Valley/Central Coast/Port Stephens areas (Sydney by negotiation). You can even buy a copy for yourself, and donate one to a local library, school library or local community group. And every donation or purchase earns you a personal thank you from me and a shout out on my Facebook page and Instagram. </p>
<p>Should I not reach my entire goal all funds will be spent printing copies of the book and fulfilling any rewards promised. </p>
<p>Should I raise an amount in excess of my goal those funds would go towards the printing of additional copies of Evangeline's moon and any additional rewards. </p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Can't afford to donate or purchase your copy of Evangeline's Moon? Or just not into picture books?

</div></div>","This is me...
I'm Laura, I'm an author and first time illustrator of children's books from the Hunter Valley, NSW in Australia. I knew I wanted to 'write books' when I was seven, and read my first novel. I would scribble stories on any sheet of paper I could get my hands on, and back in the 90s, I would enjoy my share of computer time (my brothers and I got an hour each at a time so everyone got a turn) typing up my little stories and creating strange and wonderful characters who became like friends to me. 
I've read a lot of books in my life, each one has impacted on my life, and it's that desire and that passion for impact that has driven me to write and publish my own stories. 
 
Why Picture Books?
Early literacy is a huge passion of mine, and I've worked with my own children to instil a love of books from very early on. There is tons of research out there about how beneficial it can be to share books with children, even from birth like my own children have experienced. It can help foster a lifelong love of books, and sharing a picture book can be a great way to forge relationships and connections. 
Evangeline's Moon is my second independently published picture book, the first Our Mum is Fun was released in 2017, and inspired by the crazy, funny, and sweet things that I enjoy doing with my children. 
So I guess this is the part where I give you the pitch, and tell you about my own book Evangeline's Moon. 

What We Need & What You Get
Evangeline's Moon was inspired by my daughter's obsession with the moon. Over a period of months we built up almost a mythology about the moon and how she was magic, and watched over us. But we could never reach her, which became the inspiration for this story. 

To make this book a reality, I need your help. My goal for this campaign is $1500. What this gets is:
100 copies printed in gorgeous hardcover of Evangeline's Moon
Shipping/postage/reward generation for books and other goodies sold via the campaign 
Admin costs/ISBN and barcodes and Indiegogo fees covered.
Modest marketing budget.

In addition to being able to be amongst the first to get your hands on a copy of Evangeline's Moon, you'll also have the opportunity to get prints of illustrations, stickers, postcards, and even an author visit within the Newcastle/Hunter Valley/Central Coast/Port Stephens areas (Sydney by negotiation). You can even buy a copy for yourself, and donate one to a local library, school library or local community group. And every donation or purchase earns you a personal thank you from me and a shout out on my Facebook page and Instagram. 
Should I not reach my entire goal all funds will be spent printing copies of the book and fulfilling any rewards promised. 
Should I raise an amount in excess of my goal those funds would go towards the printing of additional copies of Evangeline's moon and any additional rewards. 
 
Other Ways You Can Help
Can't afford to donate or purchase your copy of Evangeline's Moon? Or just not into picture books? You can still be a massive help to my campaign simply by hitting the share button and sharing it on your social media. Helping to get the word out helps me connect with more potential readers, which is of course the goal that every writer wants to reach - more readers.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>This year, I not only want to attend to Scarefest, I want to dominate! So, what is Scarefest? Well, I’m awfully glad you asked! </p>
<p>Scarefest is a HUGE horror convention where thousands of people come every year to meet characters and actors from their favorite horror movies and TV shows, get their fortunes told, have their pictures made with zombies, and see/do other things are guaranteed to give them chills and nightmares.</p>
<p>So who am I and why do I want to go? I’m a bestselling paranormal author. I’ve written several books, we’ll talk about those later, and I think Scarefest would be a GREAT opportunity to for me to set up as a vendor and hawk my wares. It’s different than going to a regular kind of festival or book event because the fans who attend Scarefest are horror fans and, well, I write about ghosts! Not only is this a GREAT opportunity for me to connect with potential readers, documentary producers, and other people in my field but it will give me incredible exposure. <br/></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>So why don’t I just pay for it out of my own pocket? That’s a good question, too. See, I had originally planned on doing that. At the last minute, though (literally the last minute) a snag in my regular royalties (royalties that were going to be used to pay for everything) put a halt on my plans. At first, I figured I’d give up. Maybe Scarefest wasn’t meant to be for me. But that didn’t feel right. I don’t like to quit!
</div><div>Why such a short deadline? Because Scarefest starts September 12th. I need to be able to order my books before then to ensure they get here in time. I know; nothing like working under fire!<br/>
</div><div>
<p><b>What's the money for?</b></p>
<p>Of course you want to know what your money is going towards. I'd want to know, too! So here's the breakdown:</p>
<p>* Scarefest vendor fee: $350</p>
<p>* Book order: $400</p>
<p>* Shipping: $120 (I will need to choose expedited to ensure they arrive in time)</p>
<p>* Gas and parking: $100 (the event is about an hour away for me and lasts 3 days)</p>
<p>* Food: $150 (I hate to ask for this, but a girl's gotta eat and food is not provided for us)</p>
<p>* Banner: $100 (This lets people know who I am and what the heck I'm trying to sell) </p>
<p><b>Total: $1220</b></p>
<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>My Experience</h3> <p></p>
<p>I know you want to know I'm legit. I'd want to know that, too. Not only am I a bestselling author, I also run a popular Facebook page where I collect ghost stories and other creepy tales. You can find it here: <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/HauntedEstillCounty"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/HauntedEstillCounty</a></p>
<p>So why do I write about ghosts? I love ghost stories! I actually think a place's ghost stories and folk tales say a lot about the place's culture and overall personality. I believe those stories are just as important as the ""real"" history because they're a part of oral history. If we don't write them down or pass them on, people will forget them. </p>
<p>I am no stranger to setting up and selling m books. Not to brag (okay, to brag a little) but folks have driven for hours and even come out to state to buy my books. You can read more about me in my ""about me"" section. I'm a natural at festivals and love meeting people. In fact, I encourage folks to come up to my booth and chat. Tell me a ghost story! You don't have to buy anything. Making connections is part of the fun!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I've also written ghost stories, true ones, for our local paper. Writing is a family affair in my house. My 7 year old son even helps me take the photographs we use in the books. We explore together, take pictures together, and and generally have a good time. I'm not just about making money and trying to get on the bestsellers list-this is a lifestyle for us!</p>

<p><b>Reviewers are saying...</b></p>

</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The Green Observer is a an entirely student-run magazine on the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign campus that reports on the environmental issues students care about in our region and beyond. We are the only environmentally focused publication on campus and are solely responsible for filling a unique (yet popular!) niche of student interest. We are a student program at the University YMCA. </p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>The Impact</b></h3>
<p>The Green Observer's mission is twofold:</p>
<p>     1) Highlight environmental goings-on in the University of Illinois community and in the surrounding Champaign and Urbana communities and the wider state of Illinois, and 2) Provide students with experience in writing, editing, publication layout, illustration, and fundraising.<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> </span></p>
<p>Here's what our staff members have to say about GO:</p>
<p>“I think one of the most important parts of the sustainability movement is keeping people informed, and that’s what the Green Observer does. Being environmentally aware is important to me. The Green Observer gives me a way to contribute to a cause I feel matters in society.”</p>

It's given me a chance to improve my writing skills, explore issues that I am passionate about, and connect with a lot of amazing people in environmental fields. Aside from personal development, I love being part of an organization of wonderful people who are passionate about the environment and want to extend that passion to others on campus.""</span><br/></p>

</div><div><br/></div> <div> <h3>What We Need: To Grow</h3>
<div>The Green Observer is a growing organization--we've doubled our staff since we were founded and we continue to increase our amount of high-quality content. We want to continue our growth and spread awareness of environmental issues to even more people in our area. To achieve this and reach new readers, we need to print more copies of our publication. W<span style=""background-color: initial;"">e need to purchase ink and 100% recycled paper in order to publish three more issues this school year.

The Green Observer is a an entirely student-run magazine on the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign campus that reports on the environmental issues students care about in our region and beyond. We are the only environmentally focused publication on campus and are solely responsible for filling a unique (yet popular!) niche of student interest. We are a student program at the University YMCA. 

The Impact
The Green Observer's mission is twofold:
     1) Highlight environmental goings-on in the University of Illinois community and in the surrounding Champaign and Urbana communities and the wider state of Illinois, and 2) Provide students with experience in writing, editing, publication layout, illustration, and fundraising. 
Here's what our staff members have to say about GO:
“I think one of the most important parts of the sustainability movement is keeping people informed, and that’s what the Green Observer does. Being environmentally aware is important to me. The Green Observer gives me a way to contribute to a cause I feel matters in society.”
Elise Snyder, Freshman in Biology

""Being a member of the Green Observer has undoubtedly been one of the most formative experiences of my college career. It's given me a chance to improve my writing skills, explore issues that I am passionate about, and connect with a lot of amazing people in environmental fields. Aside from personal development, I love being part of an organization of wonderful people who are passionate about the environment and want to extend that passion to others on campus.""
Catherine Kemp, Junior in Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences
  What We Need: To Grow
The Green Observer is a growing organization--we've doubled our staff since we were founded and we continue to increase our amount of high-quality content. We want to continue our growth and spread awareness of environmental issues to even more people in our area. To achieve this and reach new readers, we need to print more copies of our publication. We need to purchase ink and 100% recycled paper in order to publish three more issues this school year. Donations from sponsors allow us to minimize ad space and maximize story space!


We're also ready to add to our repertoire of environmental news articles and take on some extra projects--for example, a comprehensive calendar listing the multitude of environmental-related events on this campus. To do this, we need your help!

Additionally, the University YMCA has pledged $20,000 to its partner YMCA in Sierra Leone to help with Ebola relief (Read more about the campaign here.)  As a student program of the Y, it is our responsibility to help with fundraising, so we will be donating 50% of funds raised to the Y's Sierra Leone Ebola relief campaign.

We are offering some great perks in return for your help to keep the Green Observer flowing from the presses. 
The perks are two-fold. At every level, we offer you a thank you and a tangible gift. And the perks stack! That means that whatever donation level you choose, you will receive that level's perks in addition to all the lower perks.

<p>From being played with a tin can and a stick to audio balls and metal stumps, <span style=""font-size: medium;"">blind cricket has come a long way</span>. The enthusiasm of the visually impaired for India’s favourite game and the determination of the administrators <span style=""font-size: medium;"">to create a level playing field for the disadvantaged</span> have ensured that the game is now played professionally at the national and international level.</p>
<p>Governed by the World Blind Cricket Council, the rules have been slightly modified to accommodate challenges faced by the Visually Impaired:</p>
<ul>
<li>The white ball is made of hard plastic and filled with small ball bearings that rattle when the ball is in motion.</li>
<li>The wickets are made of metal so they make a distinct sound when hit.</li>
<li>Boundaries are set at a distance of 45-55 yards from the pitch.</li>
<li>Of the playing eleven, a team must have a maximum of four partially sighted players and three partially blind players, and a minimum of four totally blind players.</li>
<li>Bowling is underarm and it is mandatory for the ball to bounce once before the middle of the pitch.</li>
<li>The bowler at the time of delivery feels the wicket at his end to get the direction of the pitch and then gives the batsman an audio signal. In response, the batsman returns an audio signal and the ball is then delivered.</li>

<h2><span style=""color: red;"">Facts about Participating Countries<br/></span></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">Australia...</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Way back in 1922, blind cricket began in hostel at Prahan, a Suburb of Melbourne, Australia with a tin can having rocks in it, which helps the batsman to listen the sound and be alter to receive the ball. Then, the game was introduced to other states of Australia and played during the lunch breaks in workshops where visually0imapired people were employed.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In 1928 in Sydney, the first Interstate game of Blind Cricket took place between NSW and Victoria. Later the same year, a NSW team travelled to Melbourne to continue the challenge.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In January 1953, the Australian Blind Cricket Council (now Blind Cricket Australia) was formed in conjunction with the inaugural Australian Blind Cricket Carnival (Championships) which were held at Kooyong in Melbourne.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Australian Blind Cricket Carnivals (Championships) are conducted bi-annually and are held in State rotation around Australia.</p>
<p>Australia has previously reached the semi-finals of all three Blind Cricket World Cups and will be looking to improve on those results and bring back the T20 World Cup.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The team defeated England for the Ashes earlier this year and has just completed its final training camp in Brisbane last weekend.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: justify;"">Pakistan...</h3>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Blind Cricket in Pakistan is present ever since Independence. All this started from the curiosity and interest of the Visually-impaired audience who were listening to the commentary of Cricket, which has dragged them until playing Blind Cricket, exclusively played by Blind people.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In the initial stage a ball was made with fibers, a piece of wood (4 feet long 4 inches wide) as bat and an empty drum as wickets (hollow sound will be heard). Later as years passed and technologies advanced the materials used for playing also improvised gradually.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">In Pakistan the fire for the Blind Cricket caught up, when the game started framing rules and regulations for conducting matches nationally and internationally. Slowly the trend had developed among the School kids and College students.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The love for Blind Cricket increased tremendously as and when the regular matches were played initially by school students.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">One interesting part is that in the country the Blind Cricket clubs had been setup and simultaneously district and state level matches were being held by local Sports clubs and Government officials.<br/> In the year 1997, the foundation was laid to start off the Pakistan Blind Cricket Council, which has helped various registered Blind Cricket Clubs have affiliated. Regular tournaments are being held across the Country.</p>

The Cricket Association for the Blind (CABI) is the sports initiative of Samarthanam. Samarthanam has headquarters in Bangalore, India and is also a registered 501(c)3 non-profit organization in the United States (EIN 45-2470938).
There are about 10 to 12 thousand blind cricketers across India and we would try to reach as many as possible.The objective of the game is to use competitive cricket to teach the blind to look at life positively, gain in confidence and strive to be winners rather than be dependent; broaden their outlook by providing scope to travel across the country and abroad. Cricket for Blind [C4B] is a version of the sport of cricket adapted for blind and partially sighted players.
Why Cricket for the Blind?

They never ask for the sight screen to be shifted. 
They can only hear the ball, the strokes and the excited shrieks and shouts of their teammates. 
The lighting in a day and night game means little to them because the umpire is the only one who sees the game.
Sports have exposed the visually-impaired to important aspects of life, which they are otherwise denied, merely due to their disability - discipline, teamwork, fitness, strategic planning, competitiveness and sportsman spirit. The focus is on their skills and not their disability.
The Impact / Outreach

Creates awareness among the public about the abilities and talent of the visually impaired youngsters through various platforms.
Provides opportunities to exhibit their skills in front of a larger audience.
Provides coaching camps, tournaments at various levels, bilateral series and overseas tours.
Creates sense of ownership and equality in society

jobs in the sports industry which enables them to become self-reliant


Create strong network and infrastructure by taking on board active local bodies, blind schools and other bodies, formulate guidelines and supervise.
Help the local bodies to organize local level tournaments to spot talent, form teams of coaches, physiotherapists, trainers, umpires and other team personnel and oversee them.
How is Blind Cricket Played?

From being played with a tin can and a stick to audio balls and metal stumps, blind cricket has come a long way. The enthusiasm of the visually impaired for India’s favourite game and the determination of the administrators to create a level playing field for the disadvantaged have ensured that the game is now played professionally at the national and international level.
Governed by the World Blind Cricket Council, the rules have been slightly modified to accommodate challenges faced by the Visually Impaired:

The white ball is made of hard plastic and filled with small ball bearings that rattle when the ball is in motion.
The wickets are made of metal so they make a distinct sound when hit.
Boundaries are set at a distance of 45-55 yards from the pitch.
Of the playing eleven, a team must have a maximum of four partially sighted players and three partially blind players, and a minimum of four totally blind players.
Bowling is underarm and it is mandatory for the ball to bounce once before the middle of the pitch.
The bowler at the time of delivery feels the wicket at his end to get the direction of the pitch and then gives the batsman an audio signal. In response, the batsman returns an audio signal and the ball is then delivered.

“But I want a real book”
my friend said when I offered her a digital edition of the title she wanted,
and I had heard that so very often I knew it was time to launch this project.
The project is to publish 10 of my books, including 2
new titles, in all-new paperback editions with covers by Dutch graphic designer
Paul Koeleman.
All my back-list titles were first published by
mainstream publishers and were very well received and reviewed. Most of the
titles are now available as ebooks, but almost all of them are out of print in
paperback.
Now I have the opportunity to get them back into print
in perpetuity, as attractive, print on demand paperback editions.  
This project will produce a new series of quality
paperback editions of my backlist books (at Lulu.com). They will be objects pleasing to
the eye, for giving and keeping, beautiful on the bookshelf and highly
readable. Top-notch designer Paul Koeleman will create a look for the whole
series. 
The books produced with Indigogo funding will be
available affordably and efficiently anywhere in the world. There will be 10
books to start with. The quality of the series design will please established
readers and inform and entice new ones.

See designer Paul Koeleman’s
work here:
http://www.stpk.nl/
 
What are the books?
Scroll down for a short
description of the books.
 
Why support?
If you have ever enjoyed one of
these titles, if you might want to buy one of them for yourself or someone
else, if you would recommend any of them, please support this publishing
project.
Anyone interested in bookselling
and publishing knows that for years now mainstream publishers have let back
list titles go OOP and that independent publishing is the preferred option for
many authors these days, for both back lists and new titles. 
Distribution has always been the
main impediment, but now Print On Demand (POD) volumes of good quality mean
that any title can be ordered online and mailed to wherever you are. 
POD means that books don’t have
to be physically stored but can be produced almost immediately when requested.
 As an independent writer, with a body of work
that is substantial, highly regarded, and of engaging variety, independent
publishing using POD is by far the best choice for keeping titles in print.
 
Costs and the goal
The goal is to pay for the design, set up costs, and
promotions. 
The series will have a cohesive
design; being able to ensure this has given me the impetus to go ahead with
this project. The designer's fee of  3500 euros for the series is half of
the normal fee. 
The other 500 euros is for the
set up costs (approx €20 per book), fees to banks and Indiegogo, the costs of
printing and mailing review copies, and some promotion.
€4000 = $US 5406.5, AUD$ 5677.9
If I don’t make my goal, I’ll
use whatever there is to carry out as much of this project as possible.
If this campaign raises more
than the goal, the extra funds will go to  marketing campaigns (such as those
offered by Lulu.com), to being able to send out more review copies, to the
publication of the memoir Local Time (11th book on
the list), and to the future publication of my new novel with a marketing
campaign.
Wildest dreams? Being able to
buy some time to focus on completing the new novel Ghosts Like Us.  But
for now the above publishing project comes first. 
 
No money? How else you can help
No money no worries, and if you
still want to support this project, please share this campaign.
And let people know when the
books become available.  Recommend the books when you have a chance.
Reader reviews will be a
valuable contribution; it’d be great if  readers added their reviews to
online sites: Lulu, Amazon, GoodReads or others.
Any assistance in connecting
these books with their potential readers is gratefully received.

""perks"" of supporting.

favour and I will consider it.

stood up. Her face was suddenly clear and so was her mind. If something or
someone had the ability or inclination to hurtle moon debris toward Sanctuary,
there was a danger to this ship! </p>
<p>Why
would Admiral Washington say that there was none? What could the Admiral be
hiding? </p>
<p>She
reached out toward the moon again. Suddenly the electric, virtual silver sea
curled around her body like a small storm. She held both hands up toward the
moon. </p>
<p> “Let them see me,” she said defiantly.</p>
<p>With
her hands in the air she moved her fingers to find the west side of the
camouflaged bump. She circled the moon from that side of the bump, down from
the north around the polar south and back to the north again to the east side
of that hidden spot. She measured approximately 10,885 kilometers. </p>
<p>She
knew that the polar circumference of the Moon was close to 10,907 kilometers.
According to her readings the Moon was somehow missing 22 kilometers from the
east side of Luna Base Pythagoras to just northwest of the base. That of course
could not be true. </p>
<p>She
ran her sensors south to the LBP. Again, nothing . . . Wait! This time she
sensed it. Before her sensors skipped to the right, she had detected a
camouflaged cover over the Lunar Base. She had felt a faint false echo of
apparent buildings on the surface of that hidden area. It was like a reflection
that appeared to sit on top of an empty bubble; yet that bubble was the cloak. </p>
<p>To
camouflage an entire moon-base took a great deal of planning and power. Someone
had gone through a lot of work to paint a false echo of the LBP on top of the
hidden base. It was a sophisticated façade. </p>
<p>She
reached out for the computer again and felt the same nothing. This time she
understood, there was nothing there, just a programmed mirage of a silent computer
that did not exist. The subterfuge was created with her in mind. </p>
<p>It
was definitely time to make her presence known. The electric silver storm
around her became a tempest as she reached out with her hands, as if to cradle
the entire moon base in her palms. She intensified her sensors around the base
from every direction at once. Something had to be there. Her sensors dug deep,
yet she couldn’t get around that mysterious cloaked bubble. It was there but
not there; empty. . . a vacuum in the vacuum of space? </p>
<p>Wait!
At the far western edge of the base just outside the extreme perimeter . . . a
vehicle was moving! It was partial, like part of it was hidden beyond her
reach. She focused on the slow moving vehicle’s computer. </p>
<p> “What is your function?” she demanded of the
computer. </p>
<p> “MQ Space Industries, Indy-Brain number
433262,” it responded . . . then nothing. The vehicle disappeared. It was
traveling at a slow speed along the edge of the cloaked perimeter and had just
vanished. </p>
<p>SAIQA
probed into that one spot with as much sensor power as she could gather, which
was a lot. There, where number 433262 had entered the perimeter, there like a
tiny pebble dropped in water, a shield poured in to fill its small breach and
left a ripple that SAIQA had detected. </p>
<p><i>What
was with the small Indy-Brain giving its name, rank and serial number? That was
an odd response. </i></p>
<p>She
pulled back her sensors. She verified that all the repair-bots were still in
their checkered formation. She ordered forty of the bots to move into a
defensive attitude around the remaining sides of Sanctuary. The present danger
as she could see it was from the moon, but if some hidden threat should arise,
she could at least launch a sortie. </p>
<p>Due
to the anniversary celebration, and because of the greater than normal traffic
from Earth, SAIQA informed the OIC that a yellow resumption of local space
flight would be safe. She checked in with the Indy-Brain that was maintaining a
diligent eye on the two giant magnetic storms in the Sun. No coronal mass ejection
yet, but better to be cautious.</p>
<p>After
looking once again for any immediate danger from the moon, SAIQA decided that
she needed to do an ambit sensor sweep around Sanctuary and out into space. Her
readings from that “empty” camouflaged bump at the lunar base and above to its
northwest told her what she needed to be aware of. She set her sensors to read
and reread in a series of tiny nanobytes that would trail her initial probe
like billions of photonic gossamers in a gentle breeze. </p>
<p>This
time there would be no skips, no blinks; if something else should be hidden
from her first probe it would be found in the draping sensors. She clearly
identified herself in case any other active base or ship detected her scans. If
she received any inquiries she could dismiss her intrusions as a standard
scientific sweep.  She reached up her
hands and began. </p>
<p>Starting
on the left side of the hidden Pythagoras Base and reaching far out into space
she moved west, first scanning that part of the moon and then reaching beyond
and out into the Solar System. She stopped at each quarter point to wait for
her trailing web-like sensors to finish their sweeps. The first quarter
revealed nothing. The sweeps through the second and third quarters came up
empty as well, though she did have to respond to an inquiry from the main WWPA
base in Norway. Finally she ran her last sweep to the right or east of that
mysterious bump over Lunar Base Pythagoras and found nothing. Satisfied, she
then decided to slowly sweep her sensors back and forth over that empty spot
that was the LBP. </p>
<p>But
first she set many of her computers to read and reread all of the data gathered
in the space between Sanctuary and the northern part of the moon, encompassing
an area just a little wider than the 22 kilometers missing from its surface.
Pulling energy from the silver around her she raised a hand in the air, closed
her eyes and began moving her hand back and forth. Palm down . . . palm up . .
. palm down . . . palm up, back and forth. As if she was a great
cosmic chef subtly folding cream into the Milky Way. Gently sweeping and
letting the electrons and photons fall over the area on the Moon that was
cloaked, all the way back to Sanctuary, what she found surprised her again. </p>
<p>The
empty spot, the slippery cloaked area, this bump, ran from the moon to about a
thousand kilometers out from Sanctuary in an obliquely positioned isosceles
triangle. The vertex pointed at Sanctuary and the base was at the edge of the
hidden area just north of Pythagoras. It reminded SAIQA very much of a giant
upside-down Eiffel Tower with its base just north of the LBP and the top of its
tricolor flag pointing at Sanctuary. </p>
<p>That
this much space, more than one hundred thousand kilometers, could somehow be
cloaked or physically hidden from her was simply impossible. Which meant that
her sensors were not reading what was actually there; which meant that someone
had put a block into her programming or had blinded her ability to see in this
specific area. Someone or something had manipulated her abilities. She felt
outraged. She felt contaminated.</p>
<p>She
pulled back all her sensors and sat down, the warm electron silver soup
caressing her. Her mentor, her friend, Captain Ndlela . . . </p>
<p><i>What
does it mean to have a friend?</i></p>
<p>He
had talked with her about these “feelings” that she sometimes experienced. He
explained how she was different from an Independent Intelligence computer. How
her brain worked beyond what he called mathematical inference. He believed her
to have real intuition. </p>
<p>He
explained intuition as a hunch, a non-empirical knowledge, an impression or a
feeling-based compulsion which has been known to drive many human decisions.
Mr. Ndlela said that intuitions are often strongly based on an individual’s
moral values, though there seemed to be some evidence that intuition and déjà
vu can be tied to cellular memory. </p>
<p>An
Independent Intelligence brain will have a response called “Moral Indignation”
when responding to a conundrum in a morality test. The machine would attain an
almost moral righteousness in its response.</p>
<p>Mr.
Ndlela explained that her intellect compared to an Indy-Brain was like Homo
sapiens to Neanderthal. There was intelligence in the Indy-Brains, but
essentially their view of themselves was expeditious, based on what they
directly saw and what they were directly told. They reflected their environment
instead of their environment being reflected through them. But SAIQA’s
reasoning and intuitive understanding all happened at once. He praised her for
her ability to know an immoral response and to reason the consequence of such a
decision, almost at the same time. He was impressed with her speed and ability
in the moral psychology tests he had given her. </p>
<p>Though
all modern computers have a strong comprehension of syntax, SAIQA’s ability to
understand semantics was very nearly human. Mr. Ndlela had said that she could
feel the meaning behind words. It was because of her semantic ability that he
had been giving her the more sophisticated morality tests. </p>
<p>In
particular, Mr. Ndlela remarked on data from the ancient but still used MST
tests, which showed “the intention principle,” where a person can reason that a
harm intended as a means to a goal was morally worse than an equivalent harm
foreseen as a side effect to the intended goal. In other words, if a man was
going to attack another man on a train he would try to avoid hurting the
innocent people around his intended subject. But if other people should get
hurt he could justify his decision by saying it wasn’t his intention to hurt
the other people. They just happened to be in the way. They were collateral
damage. There seemed to be no counterbalancing emotional voice to question the
wisdom or morality of consequences according to the type of moral reasoning
found in the “intention principle.” </p>
<p>While
this type of reasoning is potentially dangerous to society overall when
possessed by a human in a position of power, in an Artificial Intelligence
quantum computer such as SAIQA; with her power of reasoning and potential for
destruction or collateral damage while trying to achieve a goal based on the
intention principle, it would be devastating. Tfiti had determined that SAIQA’s
view of morality was well balanced.</p>
<p><i>I
really don’t feel artificial</i>. </p>
<p>She
reached out to find Tfiti again. She checked the infirmary. Erik was still
lying on an examination bed. The medical computers were keeping a close watch
on his vital signs. All his biological functions were strong, just like him.
That unusual biomagnetic activity at the back of his brain had calmed down from
the extraordinary level at the time of his blackout to the earlier level of 2mGauss
that she noticed when he had his migraine. His normal breathing pattern
indicated he would wake soon. </p>
<p><i>This
man is important</i>, she thought, though
she didn’t know why. </p>
<p><i>Is
this intuition?</i></p>
<p>Teresa
sat in a chair nearby, holding Erik’s hand. Clearly she was concerned. SAIQA
ran a scan over Teresa. Her heart beat a little faster than normal but
otherwise she was fine. </p>
<p><i>Interesting</i>, <i>I ran the scan gently, like tucking a blanket around
a sad friend. Is it empathy? </i></p>
<p><i>Mr.
Ndlela remarks that sometimes I sound just like a woman. “And I mean that in a
good way,” he always said.</i> She
smiled. With that thought she tracked his ID. </p>
<p>He
was on an admin lift, presumably on his way to see her. The thought of seeing
Mr. Ndlela comforted her. She knew she could talk with him about this problem
of someone tampering with her programming.</p>
<p>It
was now about three hours till the celebration finale. She had anticipated
seeing the final sing-a-long that would close the anniversary. The Creator had
planned for her to make an appearance—her thoughts stopped. Something had just
happened to her programming. </p>
<p>At
the very base of her nano-structure she just . . . clicked. She would never
have noticed it before. It was that subtle. But now she was super-sensitive to
every electron wave in her being. At the foundation of her written,
mathematical OS, a skip, like a blink, had just happened. . . .  The Creator had . . .  Her bright eyes opened wide. Wait, her
programming?  . . . the sudden shift to
the right when the creator departed? . . . the door? . . . the ancient Chinese
characters? . . . the blind area of space? 
. . . this sudden blink? She had clues.</p>
<p>And,
suddenly, she had a plan. </p>
<p>She
stood up, smiling, the electron soup cascading from her waist. </p>
<p>“I
have a plan,” she said. </p>
<p>She
took a second to send a command to the third repair-bot still deep in space
where the two nuclear explosions had shattered the larger meteoroids. She
checked the other bots and Sanctuary to see if any tiny meteoroids had gotten
through. All was well. Then she scanned for General Washington. He was in his
quarters, busy on his personal photon communicator. She tried to read his
communications but somehow she was blocked. Whatever he was saying wasn’t
critical to her plan. Not at the moment anyway. She reached out to find the
Creator.</p>
<p>There
he was at the view plate in his office. He seemed to be talking to someone. Mai
Quan had always kept the room secured from her hearing. She scanned the rest of
the immediate office and found no other presence. SAIQA thought about reading
his lips but she released the idea. She would do that another time; first she
needed to find a wooden door; a door that had stood on a quay so long ago. </p>
<p>She
looked at the vast silver mass in front of her and said, “I am coming to see
you, brothers and sisters.” </p>
<p><i>Returning
to my jar of clay</i>, she thought. </p>
<p>The
vibrant electron ocean roiled and swirled around her as she ran into that
living sea. Looking like a tempest of light as the electrons transformed her
white shift into a silver bodysuit, with a leap, SAIQA dove into the silver sea
where she was born.</p>

where the two nuclear explosions had shattered the larger meteoroids. She
checked the other bots and Sanctuary to see if any tiny meteoroids had gotten
through. All was well. Then she scanned for General Washington. He was in his
quarters, busy on his personal photon communicator. She tried to read his
communications but somehow she was blocked. Whatever he was saying wasn’t
critical to her plan. Not at the moment anyway. She reached out to find the
Creator.
There
he was at the view plate in his office. He seemed to be talking to someone. Mai
Quan had always kept the room secured from her hearing. She scanned the rest of
the immediate office and found no other presence. SAIQA thought about reading
his lips but she released the idea. She would do that another time; first she
needed to find a wooden door; a door that had stood on a quay so long ago. 
She
looked at the vast silver mass in front of her and said, “I am coming to see
you, brothers and sisters.” 
Returning
to my jar of clay, she thought. 
The
vibrant electron ocean roiled and swirled around her as she ran into that
living sea. Looking like a tempest of light as the electrons transformed her
white shift into a silver bodysuit, with a leap, SAIQA dove into the silver sea
where she was born.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><b>About The Book:</b></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">When I was diagnosed with breast cancer, 900 women a week were dying of it. Thankfully in 2012, that figure was reduced to 760 women per week. That is still too many! While there are new drugs available, some women with breast cancer still have to take chemo with all its debilitating side effects.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">A few months ago, I gave a talk about ""Women of Class"" and was encouraged to publish the book. It contains my own story plus the stories of 29 anonymous women's experiences while going through breast cancer diagnosis, surgery, treatments, family matters and dealing with depression. </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">In addition to our stories, I have included information that should be of help.</span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">I have posted ""<b>Sara's Notes</b>"", that includes segments of three other women's stories and ""<b>SOS for Caregivers and Loved Ones</b>"" at the bottom of this page just before the contribution button.</span></p>
<p>Even with cancer as a subject, you will find lots of humor in this book because humor gives relief. Heaven knows, we thirty women needed relief as we experienced breast cancer.</p>
<p><b>Here's How You Can Help</b></p>
<p>I'm hoping to raise $3,030 with this campaign. The money will be used to cover expenses such as having the book edited, made available on Kindle and Nook, paperback, getting ISBN, copyright and distribution of books,etc. If I raise more than that amount, I will use the extra money for marketing. To contribute go to the bottom of this page and click on the red button that says: Contribute Now.</p>
<p><b>The Goal:</b></p>
<p>You can help us reach as many women, diagnosed with breast cancer, and their families as soon as possible. I would love to have this book out before Christmas. However, this is my first book and I don't quite know what to expect. I'm playing it safe by estimating January 2014. Be assured, if it is ready before then, you will receive it earlier.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, we will still publish, but may have to cut back to Kindle and paperbacks or possibly just Kindle.</p>

<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">If you have a loved one with breast cancer--you can help by being supportive. This may be especially hard for husbands. As the protector of the family, it may be hard to accept that you have no control over the situation. Living with a women going through breast cancer can be equal to driving your car up Independence Pass, hitting a slick spot and sliding toward the edge.</b></p>
<p><b style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">So what can you do? Listen to what she has to say. Listening is the most important thing you can do. When she shares her feelings, don't be judgmental. No one can control how they feel. Feelings are neither right or wrong--they just are. Be an active listener. One way to do this is to say, ""I hear you saying...,"" and repeat back to her the thoughts she shared with you. Don't think about your response or how you can fix it--JUST LISTEN.</b></p>
<p><b>Attend oncologists visits with her whenever possible. It helps her to know that you are in this together. If you are unable to go with her, encourage her to take a friend or a relative. I even had a new customer from the store volunteer to drive me to the plastic surgeon. My husband, Lynn, attended every oncologist visit with me. I felt like we were in this fight together.</b></p>
<p><b>Barbara's husband, Tom, said, ""Barbara would tell me she could go for chemo treatments by herself. That was unrealistic--the treatments made her too sick. When I couldn't go, my mom or dad went with her.""</b></p>
<p><b>Tom also suggested keeping a journal and documenting drug treatments.</b></p>
<p><b>Another friend, Harold, who lost his wife to breast cancer, had this advice, ""Take life one day at a time. Norman Vincent Peale's book, ""Have a Great Day"", and Billy Graham's book, ""One Day at a Time"", were very helpful to both of us.</b></p>
<p><b>In addition, Harold offered this advice, ""Don't pull away from people. If you do, you will feel alienated. People are willing to help, but sometimes they don't know what to do. If you ask them to do something concrete, they will do it. By reaching out to others, it can help them, too.""</b></p>
<p><b>If your wife or loved one is depressed, encourage her to get help by attending a support group, seeing a counselor, or both. It is hard to always be brave and supportive--you may need counseling, too.</b></p>
<p><b>Encourage her in dreams she wants to pursue. Lynn was so supportive in my writing of this book. Working full-time, I could not have accomplished it without his help. For instance, he did most of the evening cooking and cleanup while I wrote.</b></p>
<p><b>With breast cancer, the family feel they are facing an insurmountable object--like a large elephant in the living room. At some point, they may come to realize breast cancer poses the question--How do you climb over an elephant? One step at a time.     </b></p>

<p><b>NOTES FROM SARA</b></p>
<p><b>The big ""C"" changed my life. I learned to live life one day at a time and not to put off doing the things I want to do...like writing a book, telling people I love them and savoring each moment as it come. At first, I felt the big ""C"" was a millstone, but now, it has become a milestone in my life.</b></p>
<p><b>The following are excerpts from ""Women of Class""...</b></p>
<p><b>JAMIE</b></p>
<p><b>""I would come home at night and take a pain pill to ease the pain of my breast expanders. One night, I had changed into my pj's and put on a beanie to keep my bald head warm. I was spaced out and talking to my mother on the phone. I saw my cat run by on the wall shelving, as if he was chasing something. I thought, Am I seeing things? Suddenly, something hit the TV and landed in my lap. It was alive!""</b></p>
<p><b>Jamie screamed, threw the phone and jumped up. All her mother heard was screaming. She couldn't get the phone to disconnect, so ran to the next-door neighbors and dialed 911. Then she called Jamie's next-door neighbor and went racing over to Jamie's house. Jamie was outside having hysterics by this time. A squirrel had landed in her lap. Apparently, it had come down through the chimney. Friends came in and tried to catch it and they all laughed--even the police laughed.</b></p>
<p><b>ELIZABETH</b></p>
<p><b>""I thought I was going for some R&amp;R or something. I took books to read and cards to play.""</b></p>
<p><b>With a grin she went on, ""I had packed like I was going to the South Seas. The doctor told me I would be in the hospital five to seven days, so i had seven lovely gowns to wear. One was a Mickey Mouse--I thought I'd have some fun with this.""</b></p>
<p><b>From my experience with the same surgery, I can tell you Elizabeth didn't get to use any of those gowns in the hospital. In addition, she didn't have much fun either.</b></p>
<p><b>BARBARA</b></p>
<p><b>Barbara showed those pretty dimples when she recalled an incident at the doctor's office.</b></p>
<p><b>""I hate  to get on the scales to get weighed. They write down, 'with shoes,' and I told them they need to add, 'with prosthesis.' I've threatened to take it off before they weigh me. I have the new type of prosthesis that you attach to your skin. It's heavy and you can almost almost shimmy in it; it bounces just like a real breast.</b></p>
<p><b>She was smiling now with all that little girl exuberance. ""I feel like a drag queen at night because I take off my wig and I take off my breast. I also have a device to hook the 'chemo' up to--it's called a Hickman (port). What you see now is not what you get.""    </b></p>

20. Could you help with cleaning? During my illness, my family and I still face:       dirty clothes, dirty dishes, dirty house.
21. Water my flowers.
22. Just send a card to say, ""I care.""
23. Pray for me and share your faith with me.
24. Tell me what you'd like to do for me and, when I agree, please do it!
25. Tell me about support groups so I can share with others.

                                 SOS for Caregivers and Loved Ones
If you have a loved one with breast cancer--you can help by being supportive. This may be especially hard for husbands. As the protector of the family, it may be hard to accept that you have no control over the situation. Living with a women going through breast cancer can be equal to driving your car up Independence Pass, hitting a slick spot and sliding toward the edge.
So what can you do? Listen to what she has to say. Listening is the most important thing you can do. When she shares her feelings, don't be judgmental. No one can control how they feel. Feelings are neither right or wrong--they just are. Be an active listener. One way to do this is to say, ""I hear you saying...,"" and repeat back to her the thoughts she shared with you. Don't think about your response or how you can fix it--JUST LISTEN.
Attend oncologists visits with her whenever possible. It helps her to know that you are in this together. If you are unable to go with her, encourage her to take a friend or a relative. I even had a new customer from the store volunteer to drive me to the plastic surgeon. My husband, Lynn, attended every oncologist visit with me. I felt like we were in this fight together.
Barbara's husband, Tom, said, ""Barbara would tell me she could go for chemo treatments by herself. That was unrealistic--the treatments made her too sick. When I couldn't go, my mom or dad went with her.""
Tom also suggested keeping a journal and documenting drug treatments.
Another friend, Harold, who lost his wife to breast cancer, had this advice, ""Take life one day at a time. Norman Vincent Peale's book, ""Have a Great Day"", and Billy Graham's book, ""One Day at a Time"", were very helpful to both of us.
In addition, Harold offered this advice, ""Don't pull away from people. If you do, you will feel alienated. People are willing to help, but sometimes they don't know what to do. If you ask them to do something concrete, they will do it. By reaching out to others, it can help them, too.""
If your wife or loved one is depressed, encourage her to get help by attending a support group, seeing a counselor, or both. It is hard to always be brave and supportive--you may need counseling, too.
Encourage her in dreams she wants to pursue. Lynn was so supportive in my writing of this book. Working full-time, I could not have accomplished it without his help. For instance, he did most of the evening cooking and cleanup while I wrote.
With breast cancer, the family feel they are facing an insurmountable object--like a large elephant in the living room. At some point, they may come to realize breast cancer poses the question--How do you climb over an elephant? One step at a time.

NOTES FROM SARA
The big ""C"" changed my life. I learned to live life one day at a time and not to put off doing the things I want to do...like writing a book, telling people I love them and savoring each moment as it come. At first, I felt the big ""C"" was a millstone, but now, it has become a milestone in my life.
The following are excerpts from ""Women of Class""...
JAMIE
""I would come home at night and take a pain pill to ease the pain of my breast expanders. One night, I had changed into my pj's and put on a beanie to keep my bald head warm. I was spaced out and talking to my mother on the phone. I saw my cat run by on the wall shelving, as if he was chasing something. I thought, Am I seeing things? Suddenly, something hit the TV and landed in my lap. It was alive!""
Jamie screamed, threw the phone and jumped up. All her mother heard was screaming. She couldn't get the phone to disconnect, so ran to the next-door neighbors and dialed 911. Then she called Jamie's next-door neighbor and went racing over to Jamie's house. Jamie was outside having hysterics by this time. A squirrel had landed in her lap. Apparently, it had come down through the chimney. Friends came in and tried to catch it and they all laughed--even the police laughed.
ELIZABETH
""I thought I was going for some R&R or something. I took books to read and cards to play.""
With a grin she went on, ""I had packed like I was going to the South Seas. The doctor told me I would be in the hospital five to seven days, so i had seven lovely gowns to wear. One was a Mickey Mouse--I thought I'd have some fun with this.""
From my experience with the same surgery, I can tell you Elizabeth didn't get to use any of those gowns in the hospital. In addition, she didn't have much fun either.
BARBARA
Barbara showed those pretty dimples when she recalled an incident at the doctor's office.
""I hate  to get on the scales to get weighed. They write down, 'with shoes,' and I told them they need to add, 'with prosthesis.' I've threatened to take it off before they weigh me. I have the new type of prosthesis that you attach to your skin. It's heavy and you can almost almost shimmy in it; it bounces just like a real breast.
She was smiling now with all that little girl exuberance. ""I feel like a drag queen at night because I take off my wig and I take off my breast. I also have a device to hook the 'chemo' up to--it's called a Hickman (port). What you see now is not what you get.""

</h1>
<p>I didn't do this. 
For far too many years. I resigned myself to let the rapes from the past mess with my head and heart. Flashbacks invaded my sleep. I startled far too 
easily. Sex within marriage became scary and complicated. I often 
wondered if I'd ever be normal. I even disconnected from those I loved 
the most. </p>
<p>The mark that sexual abuse gave me felt indelible, permanently inked with a Sharpie pen. <b>And no matter of scrubbing erased it. </b>(Have you ever felt this way?)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/35039/files/20130826120612-dontlivemarked.jpg?1377543972"" src="""" style=""width: 176.821px; height: 243px;""/></p>The problem was, I felt that I should be ""over"" it (and well-meaning 
people said those same things to me.) After all, I became a Christian, 
and I heard all those sermons about everything being made brand spanking
 new. I believed that when I met Jesus, all those scars and marks and 
fears would instantly leave.<p><b>But they didn't erase.</b></p>
<p>The
 pathway to healing came when I realized I needed to face the past 
again, to choose to heal for my sake and for the sake of those who loved
 me. I desperately needed freedom. Have you had this same ache?</p>
<h1>You are not alone.</h1>

<h1 align=""left""><b>Your Abuse Hurts Others Too</b></h1>
<p>I wish I could say that sexual 
abuse only affected the little girl in that picture, but the truth is, 
other people are hurt because we've been hurt. <b>It's so not fair</b>, but it's reality. </p>
<p>That's
 why I felt it extremely important to add Patrick's voice to this 
project. After every chapter, he shares his perspective as the spouse of
 a victim, how he coped, what he did right and wrong, and how we healed 
together. Here's what Patrick has to say:</p>

wrote it for those who want to help the person in your life who can't 
seem to get beyond that painful memory. </p>

<h1>I wrote <i>Not Marked </i><b>because it's the book I needed to read (and I believe it's a book <i>many</i> need to read).</b> </h1>
<p>I
 did find solace in a counseling-based book, but since it hadn't been 
written from an abuse-victim's perspective, I had a hard time believing 
the tools shared would help. I asked for a lot of prayer. I went to 
counseling. I read anything that pertained to healing from sexual abuse,
 but to be honest,<b> I often felt utterly alone</b>. I believed no one understood. I kept wanting to GET OVER IT, but couldn't.</p>

</p>
<p><b><i>Not Marked</i> is the book I was created to write.</b> It's 
tearing back the curtain from my healing journey--the good, the bad, the
 frustrating, the victorious. It explores the multifaceted way we get 
well--spiritually, emotionally, physically, mentally. It gives practical
 guidance, mixed with story and hope. </p>
<p>I sit here writing this Indiegogo page as an unmarked girl, <b><i>one who has healed so beautifully from the past that many don't even know I walked that trail of tears. </i></b></p>
<h1>And yet, I still ache...not as much for me and that abused little girl, but for YOU.</h1>
<p>I
 want to see you find raucous, wild healing, to be set free from what 
has marked you. I want you to hold this book in your hands, read the 
message of hope, and then start down your own freedom path.</p>
<h1>Read how others have responded to Mary's story of healing:</h1>
<ul>
<li>
<i>""It amazes me how you, someone I've never met and probably never will
 on this earth, could in so many ways offer such insight to me of<br/>
myself--mainly through God giving you the ability to make yourself so<br/>
transparent and gifting you with the talent of expressing it in words."" </i><b>Kerstin<br/><br/></b>
</li>
<li>
<i>""Thanks again for your authenticity. It's refreshing to see and read,
 resonating with life in a fallen world, where God's glory shines 
brightest in our weakness and darkness."" </i><b>Paul<br/><br/></b>
</li>
<li>
<i>""I have been wounded by the same kind of teachings about marital 
intimacy and pleasing our husbands. Your testimony gave me 'permission' 
to still be broken - not an excuse, not justification to withhold 
myself...just the grace to not be 'sexy wife.'"" </i><b>Christine<br/><br/></b>
</li>
<li>
<i>""On so many areas of my life Mary is the brave voice that spoke out 
loud for all to hear what I can't even verbalize to myself."" </i><b>Deborah<br/><br/></b>
</li>
<li>
<i>""What makes it beautiful is the courage Mary displays by opening up 
her life for all to see, all the painful, awful things that happened to 
her, the ways it still affects her now, and how she's found, and is 
finding, freedom."" </i><b>Chuck<br/><br/></b>
</li>
<li>
<i>""I just asked my husband to read [about being marked], and it 
provided a springboard for much needed conversation. I kept saying to 
him, 'This is me; this is me.' He is reading it, and our conversations 
after 20 years of marriage have reached a whole new depth."" </i><b>Kathleen<br/><br/></b>
</li>
<li>
<i>""I was deeply touched that you normalize this journey and give hope. 
 This hope will touch generations. My family is directly impacted by 
your book. I sat down with it feeling very discouraged. Like I was 
losing the battle for intimacy - physical &amp; emotional - (you know 
those days where everything triggers you?) but it gave me courage in my 
journey which infused grace into the interactions with my family for the
 rest of the day."" </i><b>Timi</b>

<h1><b>How You Can Help:</b></h1>
<p><i><b>I've already written Not Marked</b></i>. Like I've done with my 15 other traditionally published books, I've shopped <i>Not Marked</i> to publishers. But the book is too risky, too raw, and they're afraid to publish it. <b>I totally get that.</b>
 But I believe in the book's hopeful message, so I'm taking on the risk 
myself, and asking if you'd be willing to shoulder some of it alongside 
me.</p>
<p>Publishing a book takes money if you want to do it right. <b>And this book deserves to be handled with excellence.</b> The money from this Indiegogo campaign does NOT go into my purse. It will go into the pockets of:</p>
<ul>
<li> Editors </li>

Here's me chatting about the stretch goals:Here are our stretch goals for Not Marked.


We made it to $15,000! All backers now have the opportunity to ask a question about sexual abuse. Hooray!
We made it to $17,000! All backers will have a free webinar. Date: Monday, September 30th, 7:00 PM CST.
We made it to $19,000. All backers will receive an E-study guide for the book. Estimated delivery, March 2014.
We made it to $21,000! I'll begin work on the bonus chapter, to be included in the book's release.
Look for an upcoming webinar about learning to create boundaries with bestselling author Allison Bottke. Webinar scheduled Wednesday October 9th, 7:00 PM CST.
This has funded! Now, every single backer will receive the audio recording, ready for your listening pleasure. (Hint: Maybe I can even convince my hubby to read his part!)Call a truce on the effects of sexual abuse.

I didn't do this. 
For far too many years. I resigned myself to let the rapes from the past mess with my head and heart. Flashbacks invaded my sleep. I startled far too 
easily. Sex within marriage became scary and complicated. I often 
wondered if I'd ever be normal. I even disconnected from those I loved 
the most. 
The mark that sexual abuse gave me felt indelible, permanently inked with a Sharpie pen. And no matter of scrubbing erased it. (Have you ever felt this way?)
The problem was, I felt that I should be ""over"" it (and well-meaning 
people said those same things to me.) After all, I became a Christian, 
and I heard all those sermons about everything being made brand spanking
 new. I believed that when I met Jesus, all those scars and marks and 
fears would instantly leave.But they didn't erase.
The
 pathway to healing came when I realized I needed to face the past 
again, to choose to heal for my sake and for the sake of those who loved
 me. I desperately needed freedom. Have you had this same ache?
You are not alone.
Here's my story from my memoir, Thin Places (Zondervan). 

This is how I looked when the neighborhood teenagers raped me:

Your Abuse Hurts Others Too
I wish I could say that sexual 
abuse only affected the little girl in that picture, but the truth is, 
other people are hurt because we've been hurt. It's so not fair, but it's reality. 
That's
 why I felt it extremely important to add Patrick's voice to this 
project. After every chapter, he shares his perspective as the spouse of
 a victim, how he coped, what he did right and wrong, and how we healed 
together. Here's what Patrick has to say:

I wrote Not Marked for those who have been exploited, but I also 
wrote it for those who want to help the person in your life who can't 
seem to get beyond that painful memory. 
Articles Around the Web
I have not been silent about this journey--I just haven't published an entire book about my healing process--yet. 


I've written about my struggle in marriage in this viral post, ""The Sexy Wife I Can't Be."" in A Deeper Church



Patrick and I also wrote a post for Christianity Today (Today's Christian Woman) titled ""Opening the Door to Healing."" 


And I stuck up for victims in the Her.meneutics post, ""I'm Sick of Hearing of Your Smoking Hot Wife."" 

On my website, I've exposed sexual abuse in the Amish community in ""Bonnets, Buggies and Sexual Abuse.""And recently, I read a letter to those boys who molested me:

I wrote Not Marked because it's the book I needed to read (and I believe it's a book many need to read). 
I
 did find solace in a counseling-based book, but since it hadn't been 
written from an abuse-victim's perspective, I had a hard time believing 
the tools shared would help. I asked for a lot of prayer. I went to 
counseling. I read anything that pertained to healing from sexual abuse,
 but to be honest, I often felt utterly alone. I believed no one understood. I kept wanting to GET OVER IT, but couldn't.
(Artist's rendering)

Not Marked is the book I was created to write. It's 
tearing back the curtain from my healing journey--the good, the bad, the
 frustrating, the victorious. It explores the multifaceted way we get 
well--spiritually, emotionally, physically, mentally. It gives practical
 guidance, mixed with story and hope. 
I sit here writing this Indiegogo page as an unmarked girl, one who has healed so beautifully from the past that many don't even know I walked that trail of tears. 
And yet, I still ache...not as much for me and that abused little girl, but for YOU.
I
 want to see you find raucous, wild healing, to be set free from what 
has marked you. I want you to hold this book in your hands, read the 
message of hope, and then start down your own freedom path.
Read how others have responded to Mary's story of healing:


""It amazes me how you, someone I've never met and probably never will
 on this earth, could in so many ways offer such insight to me of
myself--mainly through God giving you the ability to make yourself so
transparent and gifting you with the talent of expressing it in words."" Kerstin


""Thanks again for your authenticity. It's refreshing to see and read,
 resonating with life in a fallen world, where God's glory shines 
brightest in our weakness and darkness."" Paul


""I have been wounded by the same kind of teachings about marital 
intimacy and pleasing our husbands. Your testimony gave me 'permission' 
to still be broken - not an excuse, not justification to withhold 
myself...just the grace to not be 'sexy wife.'"" Christine


""On so many areas of my life Mary is the brave voice that spoke out 
loud for all to hear what I can't even verbalize to myself."" Deborah


""What makes it beautiful is the courage Mary displays by opening up 
her life for all to see, all the painful, awful things that happened to 
her, the ways it still affects her now, and how she's found, and is 
finding, freedom."" Chuck


""I just asked my husband to read [about being marked], and it 
provided a springboard for much needed conversation. I kept saying to 
him, 'This is me; this is me.' He is reading it, and our conversations 
after 20 years of marriage have reached a whole new depth."" Kathleen


""I was deeply touched that you normalize this journey and give hope. 
 This hope will touch generations. My family is directly impacted by 
your book. I sat down with it feeling very discouraged. Like I was 
losing the battle for intimacy - physical & emotional - (you know 
those days where everything triggers you?) but it gave me courage in my 
journey which infused grace into the interactions with my family for the
 rest of the day."" Timi


How You Can Help:
I've already written Not Marked. Like I've done with my 15 other traditionally published books, I've shopped Not Marked to publishers. But the book is too risky, too raw, and they're afraid to publish it. I totally get that.
 But I believe in the book's hopeful message, so I'm taking on the risk 
myself, and asking if you'd be willing to shoulder some of it alongside 
me.
Publishing a book takes money if you want to do it right. And this book deserves to be handled with excellence. The money from this Indiegogo campaign does NOT go into my purse. It will go into the pockets of:

 Editors 
Designers
Marketers
Formatters
and a Book Printer

Thanks for helping me shed light on this dark, dark secret. Your generosity will help set people free.
As a thank you for your help, I've provided many different types
 of backing levels with books, teaching, and speaking as an incentive. I
 even ask for YOUR story as one of the backing levels. 
Stuff You Get:

Most of the levels are self-explanatory, but here are a few highlights: 
These six audio sessions will help you get past your past. I tell my story accompanied by teaching and biblical truth. All six 
messages ask you life-changing questions and 
offer hope for the future. Read more about the audio retreat here. 
Live Uncaged started as a compilation of all my posts on healing from the past. That morphed into a
 real, live book--95 pages of wisdom, hard won, ripped from the headlines of my life.
 It’s my great, big wish that you’d find soaring healing, deep freedom, 
and the uncaged life you've longed for. Find out more about Live Uncaged here.
Watching the tree limbs keeps resilient nine-year-old Mara Weatherall 
from the pain of General’s daily attacks–attacks he warns her to keep 
secret, or else. In the small world of 1979 Burl, Texas, all Mara really
 has are the tree limbs, a lumbering Aunt Elma, her boyfriend Officer 
Gus, the bully General, and her new best friend Camilla who rhymes 
maddening snatches of truth. This novel displays the healing journey from sexual abuse in story form. Read more about Watching the Tree Limbs here. God says “I love you” in many ways, some of which are hard to hear. Like
 every teenager, Maranatha tries to sort out the confusing layers of 
love–of friends, of family, of suitors, and, desperately, of God. She 
struggles to find herself before the darkness of the past pulls her back
 to the shadow of the girl she used to be in this moving follow-up to 
the critically praised Watching the Tree Limbs. Read more about Wishing on Dandelions here.This Isn't My First Rodeo:Publishing is a difficult journey, no matter how you pursue it. Having a
 tribe of people backing this sensitive project will not only bolster Not Marked's success, but it also will encourage me in this crazy writing adventure. It's been a long journey, starting with my first published book in 2005.
I've written dozens of books with publishers like Thomas Nelson, Zondervan, Tyndale, NavPress and Harvest House Publishers.I also speak around the world about living an uncaged life. If you'd like to find out more about me, visit my website. Find me on Facebook here. Follow me on Twitter here. Visit me on Google+ here. And link with me at Linked In here.
Thank you for believing in the message of Not Marked so that others (and maybe even you) can be set free from the past and live an uncaged, joyful life today.",19.0,4,"3 Campaigns

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""line-height: 150%;""> </p></div>","Mark Twain said, “Truth is stranger than fiction, but it is because fiction is obliged to stick to possibilities; Truth isn't.”   
That nicely sums up The Snipe Hunter.  It is a true story which ranges well beyond possibilities that would make a believable novel. I know all too well that this narrative is not fiction.  I lived it.  
Mine is the story of a covert operation to support the Afghanistan mujahedeen in the late 1980s. The larger history of this period was told in George Crile’s book “Charlie Wilson’s War”.  However, The Snipe Hunter is my personal first hand account of how the combination of reactionary foreign policy, political expediency, blind ambition, ignorance and greed impacted the lives of the people involved. People who, for reasons ranging from patriotism to avarice, were caught up in an operation that would be unbelievable if it were fiction. The story spans the globe, from the Americas to Southeast Asia to the Middle-East and Europe.  It has all the elements of a novel, high sea adventure, international finance, drug smuggling, manhunts, malfeasance, rogue ops and two wars.  It’s an inside look at how covert operations are conceptualized and mounted and it examines the criminal justice system from the inside as well as the outside.

Current State of the Project:  I've been working on this project for the past 18 months. I have outlined the book and completed the basic research and documentation to substantiate my recollection of the events.  I’ve collected thousands of pages of documents, legal filings, briefs, transcripts and affidavits.  Now I feel it is imperative to interview the many government agents, crew members, U.S. Marshals, ship brokers, and peripheral players involved, so that all sides of the story can be told accurately and fully.

Why this Campaign:Being arrested at the age of 65 and losing everything that my beautiful wife and I had been able to build has left us both old and poor.  In order to finish this project I need your help in raising the money required to conduct the interviews, finish the manuscript, edit it, and format it for both print and e-book publishing.     
Use of funds:Sharon and I plan to spend June and July 2013 traveling cross-country in an RV.  We will start in Miami, Florida. and work our way north and west across the country conducting the aforementioned interviews along the way.  Our trip will terminate in Portland, Oregon near the end of July.

We need to raise $10,500 to pay for our travel and living expenses while conducting the interviews and completing the manuscript, editing, layout of the final draft, fulfillment and promotional printing and eBook conversion and distribution.  
All funds received from this campaign will be used to complete the book and get it published. Funds in excess of my goal will be used for promotion and toward writing a screenplay and movie treatment of the book. In the event that the goal is not reached, I will persevere.  In other words, not raising the entire amount won’t be a show-stopper, I’ll get as far as possible on what I have; I am obliged to bring this story to light.  I truly believe that it is something that I need to do for myself, and for my family.   My wife and children stood by me throughout the entire ordeal, and that kind of loyalty and devotion is something I found to be very rare. Finally, I am motivated by whatever good can come from this memoir as a cautionary tale.

<h3>The Epic Conclusion to The Time Weaver Chronicles</h3>
<p>My name is Thomas A. Knight, and I'm an independent fantasy author. I've been writing novels for almost three years, and writing for fantasy games and campaigns for over twenty. I've published two novels, and this campaign will help fund the editing, publishing and advertising of the third and final novel in The Time Weaver Chronicles.<br/></p>
<p>The launches for my books in the past have been low-key and somewhat quiet because I'm independant, and lack the funding and impact that the big publishers have. For me, getting some funding to help with the launch of my third book will make all the difference in the world.</p>
<p>It's my hope, that with some carefully selected advertising, and the right people helping me out, I can launch my third book onto the bestseller lists, and maybe even take my first two books with it! <br/></p>
<p><b>What people are saying about The Time Weaver Chronicles...</b></p>
<p><i>“I absolutely love The Time Weaver Chronicles. The story is so fascinating, well written, and while it has a lot of fantasy elements that I know and love, it also has new and unique elements that make it even more interesting.”</i> - Megan Monell, Love, Literature, Art, and Reason</p>
<p><i>""I was caught up in this book from the moment I started reading it. It was so full of action, adventure, magic, mystery, evil, and a twist of romance that I couldn't help but keep reading.""</i> - Angela, Angels are Kids and Furkids</p>
<p><i>“It starts good. I enjoyed it a lot. And as you read on, it gets better. And better.”</i> - Will Knight, Bibliophilia, Please</p>
<p><i>“Thomas A. Knight's, The Time Weaver is epic in every way. The world building is stunning and detailed, full of scary creatures, monumental landscapes and wonderful characters.”</i> - Sallie Lundy-Frommer, Author, Yesterday's Daughter</p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>$5,000 is a big goal, right? Not really. Advertising is expensive, especially the kind that will get my books noticed. That's where the bulk of my funding will go.</p>
<p>I'm offering some exclusive items as incentives too! Desktop wallpapers designed by my very talented wife, eBooks, paperbacks, and even hardcovers of all three books. Also, don't miss out on the chance to pick up a beautiful poster-sized print of the map for my world, Galadir.</p>
<p><strong>But hey, what's a campaign without a little fun?</strong></p>
<p>Magic in my world is separated into eight elements: fire, water, earth, air, life, death, time and shadow. Pick one of these, grab the perk for your element, and see which one is the strongest at the end of the campaign. Every person in the winning element will receive a special gift from me: a full-color, custom designed bookmark that matches your element. This will be the only time this particular bookmark will be available, so drum up support for your element, and grab a piece of history.</p>
<p><b>But wait, there's more!</b></p>
<p>If I reach my goal, in order to show my appreciation, the single person who brings the most people to my campaign through referrals will receive a $250 Amazon Gift card as a thank you gift. <br/></p>
<p>Even if I don't reach my goal, every penny will count. I'll stretch every dollar to its limit in order to reach my goals for this launch. I'm very excited about it, and feel that this is my best book yet.</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Books have always had a cultural significance to our world, and fantasy books are no different. Tolkein, Donaldson, Martin, Sanderson, and so many other wonderful authors have taken people into their worlds and enriched their lives with exciting adventures, vivid landscapes, and unique characters. By supporting me and my books, you'll be helping to bring a new world, and new adventures to people everywhere.</p>
<p>My past book launches have landed both of my books on Amazon Bestseller lists. The Time Weaver has been on the Epic Fantasy and Science Fiction Adventure lists a number of times, and Legacy has made it onto the Science Fiction Time Travel bestseller list. With an advertising budget this time, I plan on hitting more than just the Amazon bestseller lists.</p>
<p>Of course, it's not all about me. I have always supported the non-profit charity, Reglue, with a portion of my royalties, and my third book will be no different. $0.50 from every eBook, and $1.00 from every paperback sold are donated to Reglue to help offset their operating costs. By getting the word out, and reaching a broader audience with my launch, I can sell more, and give more to this very worthy cause.</p>

After closing the rift between Earth and Galadir, Seth Alkirk disappears, leaving the world of Galadir in a troubled state. The remnants of the Findoor army, led by Malia, flee into the west after the dark wizard Grian usurps the throne of her kingdom.  Grian is the most dangerous threat the people of Galadir have ever faced. To the west, he invades a neighboring kingdom with a massive army of undead. Narshuks to the south are dying of a disease unleashed by Grian. Wizards to the east struggle against his wraiths to hold on to their stronghold and the libraries within.  When Seth reappears, everyone turns to him for salvation. With the weight of an entire world yet again on his shoulders, Seth hatches a plan to show Galadir that they can fight for themselves.  Seth doesn't know his evil nemesis has finally found what he's been looking for. As Grian prepares for his final assault on the east to capture what he seeks, all of Galadir confronts him, brought together by a mysterious force. But is it enough? Alliances will be broken, new friendships made, old ones rekindled, and nobody will ever be the same. The battle for Galadir has begun.

<p><strong>Our Story</strong></p>
<p>In September 2012, a small group of young, dedicated students who are passionately opinionated about art &amp; culture began to discuss the logistics of creating a publication that would serve as a site for critical reviews and essays; after two solid months of hard work, our first issue was released and has so far received diverse and stimulating content from contributors all around the world and has in turn garnered a wide-reaching readership.</p>
<p>We have since produced two 24-page issues with a run of 2000 copies, funded at first by the Student Union of Nova Scotia College of Art &amp; Design University and generous contributions from supporters in our local community. However, since our highly valued former funders can no longer consistently provide for us, we are now turning to you, Internet, for sustenance. We are calling on you to give us the means to print four more issues in 2013 so we can keep alive the critical community discourse we have worked so hard to generate.</p>
<p>Each and every one of our contributors, editors and designers has toiled to facilitate this publication in spite of no pay since our passion, dedication and faith in this project’s potential run deep. Please help us achieve our goal of $10,000 so that the costs of producing CRITpaper can be covered for the rest of 2013, lifting a heavy cost burden from our staff whom have paid a large portion of printing costs out of their own pockets.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each issue of CRIT has 2000 copies and printed and costs roughly $750 (taxes in). It’s not a lot of money, but for a small group of individuals it is a hefty sum! If we reach our goal we will have enough money to sustain the printing for a year, provide our contributors with a humble honorarium AND have enough to send our members to review a few key exhibitions across North America!</li>
<li>As a testament to our appreciation for your support, we will eternalize our gratitude to you in print, in the credits of our upcoming issue (that’s like getting your donation acknowledged by a name plaque on a park bench!) if you kindly send $100 or more. Got a business? Wanna advertise with us? In return for your generosity, we’ll grant you free advertising space on the last outer page of the issue</li>
<li>AND if your immense generosity compels you to fully fund the printing of a single issue, you will receive a lifetime subscription to the paper via mail, major recognition in the next issue, and, no doubt, our eternal love and gratitude.</li>
<li>If we do not reach our goal, we will still use the funds we do receive to cover the coming third and fourth issues as they come to fruition.</li>
</ul><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Our first two papers had contributers from across the globe, were widely celebrated in the art community and have been sent to our peers across Canada due to demand. Help support this exciting project, bringing stimulating coverage and discourse of art to our hungry readers!</p>

<p>Panda Bear’s Paint Box had a hard mint cover with an illustrated silver spine. The word PAINTBOX was printed as a dripping rainbow, all in caps arching above a pensive young bear.

<p>The Banff Centre for Arts and Culture invites exceptional artists and leaders from around the world to create and perform new works of art and share skills and knowledge in an interdisciplinary environment. This September 9<sup>th</sup> -15<sup>th</sup>, the Literary Arts Program has invited me to attend <em>Writing with Style</em> – an international workshop for poets. Will you help me to raise funds necessary to bring my work to the attention of a global audience? This is a prestigious workshop experience that will afford me the opportunity to get an international perspective on my poetry collection in progress, <em>Indigo Season.</em> <strong>Your donation will allow this text to take its place on a broader stage, such that readers <em>outside</em> of queer communities and communities of color can learn from my work. </strong>Your artistic philanthropy is an act of interdependence, wherein you fund cultural creatives with the skill and passion to design a brighter zeitgeist with their words and materials.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Asking for your Support</strong></p>
<p><em>Writing with Style</em> is an intensive week-long residency program offering sophisticated instruction to selected writers over a carefully designed one-week period. The retreat residency will fill a professional void for me as a Queer writer of color looking to reach and dialogue with mainstream audiences globally. I need to raise as much as I can toward my goal of $2000 by July 19th to cover travel expenses, as well as tuition and room and board. Please check out indiegogo.com/writingwithstyle to donate. Thank you so much!!</p>
<p>All funds donated to this effort will go toward expenses listed below:</p>
<p>Tuition for this workshop is $425</p>
<p>Room and board for 8 days is $725</p>
<p>Roundtrip flight to Calgary International Airport from SFO est. $550</p>

<p><strong>Grand Total $1830</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am writing to ask for your support in achieving this goal. I am currently working to complete my BFA at the California College of the Arts.  My income consists of unsubsidized student loans, federal workstudy wages during the Fall and Spring semesters and freelance videography and editing work.  Like many, I have monthly expenses that regularly exceed my income such that I am unable to set aside funds toward this effort. It is only with your support that I will be able to participate in this amazing opportunity.</p>

<h2><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h2>
<p><i>Nourish</i> is about exploring the social relationships that are facilitated by food and cooking. Ascribing sentiment and connection with food is something uniquely human, and the implications of these relationships have impacts on our lives. <br/><br/>My name is Amenda Lee and I am the author of Nourish. I wrote this book because I wanted to create something that is not only a commentary on our current food relationships, but also is a text that exposes the inequities and harmful societal norms that are present in the food we consume and the routines we have.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that our relationships with food are very complex. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for social and personal connections viewed through the lens of food. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you grow your own positive relationship with food or cooking.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this book, you'll learn about the highly connective nature of food and how it helps us relate to others. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>How a body-positive social media influencer with over a million followers spanned on her social media started her career</li>
<li>The unraveling of the origins of LA’s Korean community’s biggest mysteries — LA Galbi</li>
<li>My recovery from the physical and mental toll eating disorders had on my life.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you love food, sociology, and cooking.<br/><br/><i>Nourish</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to young and older audiences who want to look at cooking and their unique food relationships in a new way.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Musehouse is a non-profit Center for the Literary Arts located in the Chestnut Hill neighborhood of Philadelphia.  Musehouse is quickly becoming known for its smart but unpretentious, warm and welcoming environment where writers of all ages and levels can hone their craft and share their work publicly.  It was founded in September 2011 by Kathleen Sheeder Bonanno, an award winning poet and teacher.  Bonanno’s book, <em>Slamming Open the Door</em>, was among the 10 best-selling books of poetry in America in 2009.  Based on the true story of her daughter’s murder, the book and Bonanno’s subsequent book tour reminded her that creative writing can and does change lives for the better, which is what led her to found Musehouse.  Founded just one short year ago, Musehouse already offers a roster of 20 creative writing courses for authors of all ages and levels of experience in poetry, fiction, non-fiction, and playwriting.  Instructors include published and prize-winning authors and seasoned teachers from local colleges and other literary organizations. </p>
<p>While Musehouse has created a comfortable and nurturing space, the true magic comes from the writers who arrive for class each week… <strong>Elizabeth,</strong> 83 years old, always the first to arrive for her poetry class, carrying her respirator and waving a bag of carefully-crafted earrings that she donates as our weekly door prize  … <strong>Lola,</strong> a homeschooled 12-year-old, feisty, talented, who wants her book of poetry published <em>now </em>…  <strong>Tim,</strong> scooting in late, carrying his hefty memoir about his life on the battlefield during the Vietnam War … and <strong>Veronica,</strong> quiet, uncertain, here for the Grief and Loss Writing class where, for the first time, she will write about her son’s death.</p>

<div>
<br/>The problem is, I cannot afford the time to stop ghostwriting to finish the novel. It’s been 10 years. Meanwhile I write about 5,000 words a week for other people. All these pesky bills have to get paid somehow so I cannot stop writing for money.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I need to write another 400 pages – or 100,000 words. This will take me about 10 weeks. With time flying by so fast – I just turned 64 – I am afraid that I will die with my novel never completed.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>With a little help from my friends, I hope that I can find the free time this summer to finish my novel.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If my goal is not fully reached, I can still buy time to get a good chunk of it done.</div>
<div> </div>
<p>Here's how it begins:</p>
<p> </p>
<p align=""center"">Chapter One</p>
<p align=""center""><em>January 8, 1935. </em><em>3 a</em><em>.m.</em></p>
<p>Lurlene Larue was screaming. Her husband, Tom, was driving as fast as he dared. The old Chevy National truck shuddered with the speed.  They had pulled off the highway and into Tupelo just after midnight and tried to catch some sleep. The trip north was tiring and Lurlene was heavily pregnant. It was a race against time to get to Maine where they had the offer of a free home in return for farm work. Tom’s brother and cousin had opted for California but Tom wisely thought that going North would be a better opportunity because there would not be as many competing for work. Lurlene wasn’t due for another month but the jouncing of the truck along the highway was giving her pains. There hadn’t been a chance for much shuteye. The pains increased and by 2 a.m. Lurlene was moaning and half an hour later, they went in search of a doctor. Tom was worried about the cost and how they would get around the problem of money if he had to pay a doctor. In his mind, birthing was something that took place with the womenfolk helping.</p>
<p>Once they got to Maine, they might have to find a midwife because they didn’t have any female kinfolk there. Just Uncle James but James likely knew someone. Even if they had to use a midwife, she would be willing to wait for her pay. But here in Tupelo, the doctor would want his money up front. Tom’s mind was running around on this train of thought when Lurlene began screaming. “I’m dying. Jesus, Tom, I’m dying.”</p>
<p>Where would he find a doctor?  The night sky was unusually bright, with a blue band of lighter sky casting a dusk-like clarity over the ramshackle sharecropper edge of town. There was a diner that looked like it might be open and Tom slowed down. It might just be the owner cleaning up but it would be someone who could tell him how to get to the doctor’s house. As Tom pulled to a stop, a middle-aged black man emerged from the diner. He didn’t lock the door behind him so it might just be a late night local version of a speakeasy.  Tom wondered sometimes why his mind kept drifting off topic. Who gave a good goddamn who the man was? The important thing was to find the doctor. If Lurlene died, his life would be over.</p>
<p>Tom opened the door and called out, “Hey.”</p>
<p>The black man stopped and replied with his own “Hey.”</p>
<p>“Can you tell me where to find a doctor?” The screaming was all the proof needed for the urgency of his request.</p>
<p>The man said, “Yep. Dr. Hunt lives not too far away.” He gave the directions that involved several right turns, a mile long drive and a couple of left turns. Tom tried to capture the instructions in his mind. He thanked the man and retreated into the truck. Or tried to. Lurlene was stretched out on the seat, whimpering and the blood was flowing from between her legs. A little body, bluetinted from the night sky, was between her tucked up feet. Tom took off his shirt and wrapped the little body in it. The cord was still attached to Lurlene’s insides. He laid the shirt-wrapped baby on her chest as she pulled her knees closer to her so Tom could get into the driver’s seat.</p>
<p>He lurched forward and chanting the instructions, raced to the doctor’s house. Lurlene was patting the baby and Tom could hear a raspy breathing  as well as Lurlene’s murmurs. He saw the house as described and leaving his family in the bloody truck, pounded on the door until a tired-looking woman answered.</p>
<p>“Bill’s not here. He’s over to the Presley place.”</p>
<p>Tom’s head was filled with splintery stars. He wanted to holler, “Who the hell is Presley?” Instead he apologized and asked how he could find the Presley place. He got another set of instructions and jammed himself back into the truck and rattled off in the direction the woman explained to him. His pants were damp from the blood and the afterbirth was out of Lurlene. The baby should have been making more than little mewling sounds by now. He should have picked the child – he realized he didn’t know if it was a boy or a girl – up by the feet and smacked it on the bottom to get it breathing right. But he didn’t dare stop.</p>
<p>The Presley place was easy to find – there were lights flickering in the front window.  Tom stopped the vehicle and ran into the house. The front door opened into a small room that served as a kitchen. It was lit by candle. A curtain with faded red roses swung in the doorway into the back room.  A man came through the kitchen. Older, stern looking, and more than inebriated, the man glared at Tom. “What d’ya want?” he snarled.</p>
<p>“The doctor.”</p>
<p>“Get the hell out of here. My grandson is dead.” He waved a big dirty hand in the direction of the table against the wall. Tom thought, “and my son is likely dead too.” He looked into the box and saw a little corpse naked inside. A boy. His cord cut and tied off about a foot from where it attached to the limp little body. Tom choked on his own tears and went outside. Precious time was being wasted while he stared at the dead baby. Lurlene was sobbing when he got to the truck.</p>
<p>“He’s dead,” Lurlene said. “Ti-Tom is dead.”</p>
<p>“Maybe not. The doctor is inside.” He grabbed the baby and then realized that the cord had not been cut. He took out his knife and cut the baby free from its mother. He looked to see whether it was a boy or not.</p>
<p>It was a boy. He was a boy. Tom leaned down to kiss the boy and realized that he was indeed dead. Maybe he had never breathed at all and the raspy little breath was the sound of his own fear in his ears. He took the baby inside rather than tell Lurlene just yet. Let her have a few more minutes of motherhood. Even if it was not real. In the house, the chaos was still going on in the back room. It was almost 4:30 in the morning according to the clock on the table next to the box. He looked into the box, the anguish of thinking of two little babies who would never live. The baby was pink while Ti-Tom was already turning blue. The random thought passed through Tom’s mind that perhaps the baby had been born dead and the blue tinge was not a reflection of the sky but the baby’s true color. He laid his child down beside the box and placed his hand on his son and the pink baby. Ti-Tom was not as warm as the baby in the box. The baby in the box moved.</p>
<p>Voices rose in the back room and it sounded like the ordeal was almost over and then he heard a male voice proclaim. “It’s a boy and he’s…” and whatever the man said was lost in the baby’s first rebel-yell quality cry. No thought was involved. Tom opened his shirt that covered his baby and held the tiny body in his left hand while he used his right to lift the baby from the box and set him on the shirt while depositing the dead baby in the cardboard box. The baby in the shirt whimpered. He left the dead baby in the box and picking up the shirt, wrapped the new Ti-Tom tightly while he walked towards the truck.</p>
<p>“He’s alive, he’s alive and he’s perfect.”</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p></div>","I’m a ghostwriter with a dream. I want to finish my own novel – a fictionalized version of the life of Elvis Presley’s twin, Jesse. The novel is completely outlined and the first 100 pages are written.

The problem is, I cannot afford the time to stop ghostwriting to finish the novel. It’s been 10 years. Meanwhile I write about 5,000 words a week for other people. All these pesky bills have to get paid somehow so I cannot stop writing for money.
 
I need to write another 400 pages – or 100,000 words. This will take me about 10 weeks. With time flying by so fast – I just turned 64 – I am afraid that I will die with my novel never completed.
 
With a little help from my friends, I hope that I can find the free time this summer to finish my novel.
 
If my goal is not fully reached, I can still buy time to get a good chunk of it done.
 
Here's how it begins:
 
Chapter One
January 8, 1935. 3 a.m.
Lurlene Larue was screaming. Her husband, Tom, was driving as fast as he dared. The old Chevy National truck shuddered with the speed.  They had pulled off the highway and into Tupelo just after midnight and tried to catch some sleep. The trip north was tiring and Lurlene was heavily pregnant. It was a race against time to get to Maine where they had the offer of a free home in return for farm work. Tom’s brother and cousin had opted for California but Tom wisely thought that going North would be a better opportunity because there would not be as many competing for work. Lurlene wasn’t due for another month but the jouncing of the truck along the highway was giving her pains. There hadn’t been a chance for much shuteye. The pains increased and by 2 a.m. Lurlene was moaning and half an hour later, they went in search of a doctor. Tom was worried about the cost and how they would get around the problem of money if he had to pay a doctor. In his mind, birthing was something that took place with the womenfolk helping.
Once they got to Maine, they might have to find a midwife because they didn’t have any female kinfolk there. Just Uncle James but James likely knew someone. Even if they had to use a midwife, she would be willing to wait for her pay. But here in Tupelo, the doctor would want his money up front. Tom’s mind was running around on this train of thought when Lurlene began screaming. “I’m dying. Jesus, Tom, I’m dying.”
Where would he find a doctor?  The night sky was unusually bright, with a blue band of lighter sky casting a dusk-like clarity over the ramshackle sharecropper edge of town. There was a diner that looked like it might be open and Tom slowed down. It might just be the owner cleaning up but it would be someone who could tell him how to get to the doctor’s house. As Tom pulled to a stop, a middle-aged black man emerged from the diner. He didn’t lock the door behind him so it might just be a late night local version of a speakeasy.  Tom wondered sometimes why his mind kept drifting off topic. Who gave a good goddamn who the man was? The important thing was to find the doctor. If Lurlene died, his life would be over.
Tom opened the door and called out, “Hey.”
The black man stopped and replied with his own “Hey.”
“Can you tell me where to find a doctor?” The screaming was all the proof needed for the urgency of his request.
The man said, “Yep. Dr. Hunt lives not too far away.” He gave the directions that involved several right turns, a mile long drive and a couple of left turns. Tom tried to capture the instructions in his mind. He thanked the man and retreated into the truck. Or tried to. Lurlene was stretched out on the seat, whimpering and the blood was flowing from between her legs. A little body, bluetinted from the night sky, was between her tucked up feet. Tom took off his shirt and wrapped the little body in it. The cord was still attached to Lurlene’s insides. He laid the shirt-wrapped baby on her chest as she pulled her knees closer to her so Tom could get into the driver’s seat.
He lurched forward and chanting the instructions, raced to the doctor’s house. Lurlene was patting the baby and Tom could hear a raspy breathing  as well as Lurlene’s murmurs. He saw the house as described and leaving his family in the bloody truck, pounded on the door until a tired-looking woman answered.
“Bill’s not here. He’s over to the Presley place.”
Tom’s head was filled with splintery stars. He wanted to holler, “Who the hell is Presley?” Instead he apologized and asked how he could find the Presley place. He got another set of instructions and jammed himself back into the truck and rattled off in the direction the woman explained to him. His pants were damp from the blood and the afterbirth was out of Lurlene. The baby should have been making more than little mewling sounds by now. He should have picked the child – he realized he didn’t know if it was a boy or a girl – up by the feet and smacked it on the bottom to get it breathing right. But he didn’t dare stop.
The Presley place was easy to find – there were lights flickering in the front window.  Tom stopped the vehicle and ran into the house. The front door opened into a small room that served as a kitchen. It was lit by candle. A curtain with faded red roses swung in the doorway into the back room.  A man came through the kitchen. Older, stern looking, and more than inebriated, the man glared at Tom. “What d’ya want?” he snarled.
“The doctor.”
“Get the hell out of here. My grandson is dead.” He waved a big dirty hand in the direction of the table against the wall. Tom thought, “and my son is likely dead too.” He looked into the box and saw a little corpse naked inside. A boy. His cord cut and tied off about a foot from where it attached to the limp little body. Tom choked on his own tears and went outside. Precious time was being wasted while he stared at the dead baby. Lurlene was sobbing when he got to the truck.
“He’s dead,” Lurlene said. “Ti-Tom is dead.”
“Maybe not. The doctor is inside.” He grabbed the baby and then realized that the cord had not been cut. He took out his knife and cut the baby free from its mother. He looked to see whether it was a boy or not.
It was a boy. He was a boy. Tom leaned down to kiss the boy and realized that he was indeed dead. Maybe he had never breathed at all and the raspy little breath was the sound of his own fear in his ears. He took the baby inside rather than tell Lurlene just yet. Let her have a few more minutes of motherhood. Even if it was not real. In the house, the chaos was still going on in the back room. It was almost 4:30 in the morning according to the clock on the table next to the box. He looked into the box, the anguish of thinking of two little babies who would never live. The baby was pink while Ti-Tom was already turning blue. The random thought passed through Tom’s mind that perhaps the baby had been born dead and the blue tinge was not a reflection of the sky but the baby’s true color. He laid his child down beside the box and placed his hand on his son and the pink baby. Ti-Tom was not as warm as the baby in the box. The baby in the box moved.
Voices rose in the back room and it sounded like the ordeal was almost over and then he heard a male voice proclaim. “It’s a boy and he’s…” and whatever the man said was lost in the baby’s first rebel-yell quality cry. No thought was involved. Tom opened his shirt that covered his baby and held the tiny body in his left hand while he used his right to lift the baby from the box and set him on the shirt while depositing the dead baby in the cardboard box. The baby in the shirt whimpered. He left the dead baby in the box and picking up the shirt, wrapped the new Ti-Tom tightly while he walked towards the truck.

<p>Growing up, did you ever sit in front of a TV, a
16mm school projector or a VCR and come under the hypnotic spell of the tuff,
sassy, cool and inspiring kids that you saw on the screen? Perhaps you grinned
as Jacob Two-Two stood up to The Hooded Fang, thrilled as Hawk Jones grabbed a
small arsenal to take down some gangsters or cringed as a bespectacled Scott
Baio got <i>Stoned</i>?</p>
<p>We certainly looked up to many of these pint-sized
tots, tweens and teens, and chances are you did too. That’s why we’re devoting
the first anthology in the new <a href=""http://www.spectacularoptical.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Spectacular Optical</a> book series, KID POWER!, to this
inspiring world of kid cult classics from North America, the UK, Australia and beyond.
From the 1940s antics of <i>Curley and his
Gang</i> to the overwrought denim-clad melodrama of <i>The ABC Afterschool Special</i>, from the surreal fantasies of <i>The Peanut Butter Solution </i>to the pre-teen
bloodsucking melodrama <i>The Little Vampire</i>,
KID POWER! is a heavily-illustrated collection of film writing by a diverse array of some of genre criticism’s
most unique voices. </p>
<p>My name is
<b>Kier-La Janisse</b>, and I’m very excited to be taking on the role of co-editor and
publisher for the Spectacular Optical series. I have been a film writer and
programmer since 1997. I’ve had two books of my own published by FAB Press (<a href=""http://www.fabpress.com/books/house-of-psychotic-women-hardback.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HOUSE OF PSYCHOTIC WOMEN</a> and <a href=""http://www.fabpress.com/books/violent-professional-a-paperback.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">A VIOLENT PROFESSIONAL: THE FILMS OF LUCIANO ROSSI</a>), as
well as many articles in magazines and journals ranging from FANGORIA to INCITE
JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDIA, but KID POWER! will be the first book published
under my own imprint, the micro-press <a href=""http://www.spectacularoptical.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Spectacular Optical</a>. This inaugural
anthology of kid-centric essays and interviews is co-edited with my friend and
Managing Editor <b>Paul Corupe</b>, best known as the founder of both the Canadian
cult film website <a href=""http://www.canuxploitation.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Canuxploitation.com</a> and Toronto’s <a href=""http://theblackmuseum.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Black Museum</a> horror lecture
series.</p>
<p>For KID
POWER!, the first in our series of themed cult film writing anthologies, I’m honoured to have the
participation of writers from across the globe including author/film producer
<b>Zack Carlson</b> (DESTROY ALL MOVIES!! THE COMPLETE GUIDE TO PUNKS ON FILM and THE
AMERICAN SCREAM), FANGORIA Magazine Editor-in-Chief <b>Chris Alexander</b>,
underground comic legends <b>Rick Trembles</b> (MOTION PICTURE PURGATORY) and <b>Robin

Singleton</b> (FANGORIA) as well as myself and Paul rounding out the bunch. It’s gonna
be epic!</p>
<p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p></p>
<p>We’ve largely completed pre-production work on KID
POWER!, which is set to launch at the Fantasia International Film Festival in
Montreal, Canada (July 17-Aug 5), with a U.S. launch shortly thereafter. To
help cover the initial printing costs and get Spectacular Optical off the
ground, we’re offering the chance to pre-order the book and help us make it the
way we envision it. We know you’ll want the book. But we think you’ll want it sooner
rather than later! </p>
<p>The funds raised here will go specifically toward
printing costs and artist fees – not only designer fees, but all contributors
to the book (with the exception of myself – part of my own contribution) will
receive royalties on every copy sold. Part of our goal with Spectacular Optical
is to create a small but sustainable business that is able to pay artist fees
to the many awesome (and often underpaid) writers and graphic artists working
in our field, and to give them books they are proud of. </p>
<p>Cover
and Chapter Headings for the KID POWER! book are being created by Portland-based artist <b>Austin Sellers</b> (<a href=""http://www.austinmadethis.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.austinmadethis.com</a>). The book will be a stylish, full colour trade
paperback with a matte-coated cover with spot gloss.Check out the cover below:<br/></p>

</blockquote><p>This may be the first book I’m publishing under my
own imprint, but it’s far from the first project I’ve managed at this scale.
I’ve founded and operated film festivals (CineMuerte Film Festival, Vancouver)
and independent micro-cinemas (the <a href=""http://www.blue-sunshine.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Blue Sunshine Psychotronic Film Centre</a>,
Montreal), and have also coordinated a number of film commission projects and
live performances. Even the skills I learned running a fanzine back in the ‘90s
have proven useful on this project! But aside from whatever skills, experience
and connections we bring to the table (you can read our full bios below), we’ve
also been mentored all along the way by the British cult film publisher FAB
Press - so we have some good people on our side making sure we don’t fall. </p>
<p>KID POWER! will be published even if we don’t meet
our goal—the book is completely written and copy-edited, contracts have been
signed, photographs have been sourced and the book is being laid out. We’re
well on our way! </p>
<p>This funding challenge not only allows you to
pre-order a limited edition copy of KID POWER!, it’s also intended to help make
the book as awesome as we know it can be—a heavily-illustrated, full colour edition
with a beautiful cover. If we don’t meet our goal, we will still print the
book, but it will be in black &amp; white, with less frills. And we’re hoping
that our debut can represent the best we have to offer, which will lead to the
kind of word of mouth that will allow us to continue Spectacular Optical. Success
with selling this first book will go a long way in ensuring a stable foundation
for our next book. </p>

What We Need & What You Get
We’ve largely completed pre-production work on KID
POWER!, which is set to launch at the Fantasia International Film Festival in
Montreal, Canada (July 17-Aug 5), with a U.S. launch shortly thereafter. To
help cover the initial printing costs and get Spectacular Optical off the
ground, we’re offering the chance to pre-order the book and help us make it the
way we envision it. We know you’ll want the book. But we think you’ll want it sooner
rather than later! 
The funds raised here will go specifically toward
printing costs and artist fees – not only designer fees, but all contributors
to the book (with the exception of myself – part of my own contribution) will
receive royalties on every copy sold. Part of our goal with Spectacular Optical
is to create a small but sustainable business that is able to pay artist fees
to the many awesome (and often underpaid) writers and graphic artists working
in our field, and to give them books they are proud of. 
Cover
and Chapter Headings for the KID POWER! book are being created by Portland-based artist Austin Sellers (www.austinmadethis.com). The book will be a stylish, full colour trade
paperback with a matte-coated cover with spot gloss.Check out the cover below:

Aside
from these pre-sale packages, we also have many additional perks ranging from
movie tickets to original artwork, care of our campaign sponsors Drafthouse Films, Fantastic Fest, The Fantasia International Film Festival, MONDO, Trash Palace, CineFamily, FAB Press, The Black Museum and animator/illustrator Leslie Supnet. Check out the detailed perk levels in the right-hand column! The Impact
""Having been fortunate enough to work alongside Kier-La at multiple events, I could not be more convinced that she's one of the most knowledgeable, creative and insightful voices in the world of genre 
film today. She doesn't just know her shit, she knows how to help other people know her shit, too, in the most entertaining way possible.""- Todd Brown, Founder and Editor-in-chief, Twitch / Acquisitions, XYZ Films
This may be the first book I’m publishing under my
own imprint, but it’s far from the first project I’ve managed at this scale.
I’ve founded and operated film festivals (CineMuerte Film Festival, Vancouver)
and independent micro-cinemas (the Blue Sunshine Psychotronic Film Centre,
Montreal), and have also coordinated a number of film commission projects and
live performances. Even the skills I learned running a fanzine back in the ‘90s
have proven useful on this project! But aside from whatever skills, experience
and connections we bring to the table (you can read our full bios below), we’ve
also been mentored all along the way by the British cult film publisher FAB
Press - so we have some good people on our side making sure we don’t fall. 
KID POWER! will be published even if we don’t meet
our goal—the book is completely written and copy-edited, contracts have been
signed, photographs have been sourced and the book is being laid out. We’re
well on our way! 
This funding challenge not only allows you to
pre-order a limited edition copy of KID POWER!, it’s also intended to help make
the book as awesome as we know it can be—a heavily-illustrated, full colour edition
with a beautiful cover. If we don’t meet our goal, we will still print the
book, but it will be in black & white, with less frills. And we’re hoping
that our debut can represent the best we have to offer, which will lead to the
kind of word of mouth that will allow us to continue Spectacular Optical. Success
with selling this first book will go a long way in ensuring a stable foundation
for our next book.

<div>
<ul>

<div>Anders Tengner is by far the most celebrated music journalist in Sweden. A Swedish Neil Strauss or Mick Wall if you will. Starting as a writer at music mag Okej in the 80's, he soon got the opportunity to work with his own TV shows. If you didn't know Anders, there was no way you were gonna sell your music in Sweden. Literally every rock star stopped for an interview, a friendly chat and a photo shoot. In his successfull biographical memoir of these crazy times, <em>Access all areas - My life with the giants of rock</em>, he tells the story of his encounters with the metal elite. <em>Access ...</em> has sold more than 35 000 copies.

<p>Giant alien creatures, colossal space battles, ancient derelict starships, the survival of humanity all wrapped in a character driven story spanning over a decade... </p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/14929/files/20130815192909-DDPOSTER.jpg?1376620149"" src="""" style=""width: 426.1590145576708px; height: 670px; cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
<h2>What is Deep Darkness?</h2>
<p> Deep Darkness is a new science fiction/horror property/book that takes place 30,000 years from now. It follows a man named Sev from his childhood on the alien planet Errikus to his life living and surviving aboard the starship Erebus. Humans are at war and on the run from an alien race called the Skrav heading to a place called the void. Deep Darkness doesn't just take place all in the future though. There is an element called the nexus onboard the ship that allows users like Sev to see the past, present, and future through someone else's eyes. This allows me to tell some amazing stories taking place in the not so distant future and the past. Parts of Deep Darkness are even based on real accounts from World War 2 veterans that I have had the privelage to talk to.  </p>
<p>The book itself is about 31 chapters and close to 100,000 words.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT THE FUNDING IS FOR:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Printing and publishing of the first edition of Deep Darkness</li>
<li>Manuscript preparation and formatting </li>
<li>Copy editing and proofreading</li>
<li>Interior design and cover design</li>
<li>Delivery of books</li>
<li>E-Conversion</li>
<li>Official website</li>
<li>Concept trailer/ short film</li>
</ul>
<p>When you fund this campaign you are not just funding a book being made. You are showing there is a demand for new original science fiction. You are helping us create a living world full of artwork, 3D models, props and more. If this campaign is successfully funded we will be creating a<strong> concept trailer/short film</strong> (that we plan to run about 10-15 minutes). </p>
<p>In the concept trailer we are planning to show:</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">• A short scene from the book that will have a sci-fi/horror vibe.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">• A view of the alien colony Errikus along with the Erebus and other alien   starships created by professional 3D artists</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">• Heavy use of Prosthetics and props for monsters. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">• Sci-Fi looking body armor/props (for a $500 pledge you can own)</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">• A personal-character driven story set in the future that is scary and unknown. </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">• That we can create a big budget looking film without a hollywood size budget.</p>
<p>We already have mics, cameras, and lights but for this to be a success we need to be sure that we can launch the book and cover any lingering costs. This means that this campaign has to be a success. </p>
<p>This can only be accomplished with your help.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Mankind is endangered. The Skrav have destroyed our sun and sent us into the depths of space. On the run our only hope lies in a place called the void. A place foretold by the nexus, an element that lets us see past, present, and future. Everywhere we go destruction follows. We have been running for 30,000 years. </p>
<p>The war with the Skrav has been at a standstill for years now. Humans have settled on the colony Errikus, an alien colony and last stop before the empty space between the spirals in the milky way galaxy. Sev was born on this world but he wasn't made for it. His lungs aren't use to the open air, his eyes can't tolerate the natural light, and his mind is meant to be somewhere else. By age twelve the starship Erebus and Aelita leave with the last of mankind aboard.</p>
<p>Sev is a user. His life consists of living on the starship Erebus. Day in and day out he watches through the eyes of people who have died. People who haven't been born. It is through his eyes, his words, his actions this war will come to an end. Will he bring mankind to the end of our journey or will he be our fall. </p>

<h2>Who Am I Exactly?</h2>
<p>My name is Stephen Landry, I was born in Nashville, Tennessee. I have a Bachelors degree in graphic design. I have had the privelage of working with some great startup companies, indie game studios, and indie film studios creating exciting projects. I have spent the last year stuggling as a freelance graphic designer while also being able to work with up and coming authors in fantasy, science fiction, and horror designing book covers, creating character art, and even helping some of them develop their stories. Aside from my graphic design I also am an amateur film director. I have created two award winning short films in the Nashville area.</p>
<p>I have suffered from depression and anxiety my whole life. Science fiction has always been a great escape for me. This is my way of taking my life and giving back not just for myself but for others like me seeking new worlds to help them surivive the day in and day out. It has taken me a long time to get to a comfortable point posting this and releasing this much to the world. I am nervous, afraid, scared but I am not going to let it get the best of me.</p>
<p>My ultimate goal is to release the book and pitch this for a full length science fiction film. It all begins here with your help. </p>

<p></p></span></div>","Welcome to Deep Darkness!
Giant alien creatures, colossal space battles, ancient derelict starships, the survival of humanity all wrapped in a character driven story spanning over a decade... 


What is Deep Darkness?
 Deep Darkness is a new science fiction/horror property/book that takes place 30,000 years from now. It follows a man named Sev from his childhood on the alien planet Errikus to his life living and surviving aboard the starship Erebus. Humans are at war and on the run from an alien race called the Skrav heading to a place called the void. Deep Darkness doesn't just take place all in the future though. There is an element called the nexus onboard the ship that allows users like Sev to see the past, present, and future through someone else's eyes. This allows me to tell some amazing stories taking place in the not so distant future and the past. Parts of Deep Darkness are even based on real accounts from World War 2 veterans that I have had the privelage to talk to.  
The book itself is about 31 chapters and close to 100,000 words.
WHAT THE FUNDING IS FOR:

Printing and publishing of the first edition of Deep Darkness
Manuscript preparation and formatting 
Copy editing and proofreading
Interior design and cover design
Delivery of books
E-Conversion
Official website
Concept trailer/ short film

When you fund this campaign you are not just funding a book being made. You are showing there is a demand for new original science fiction. You are helping us create a living world full of artwork, 3D models, props and more. If this campaign is successfully funded we will be creating a concept trailer/short film (that we plan to run about 10-15 minutes). 
In the concept trailer we are planning to show:
• A short scene from the book that will have a sci-fi/horror vibe.
• A view of the alien colony Errikus along with the Erebus and other alien   starships created by professional 3D artists
• Heavy use of Prosthetics and props for monsters. 
• Sci-Fi looking body armor/props (for a $500 pledge you can own)
• A personal-character driven story set in the future that is scary and unknown. 
• That we can create a big budget looking film without a hollywood size budget.
We already have mics, cameras, and lights but for this to be a success we need to be sure that we can launch the book and cover any lingering costs. This means that this campaign has to be a success. 
This can only be accomplished with your help.
DEEP DARKNESS
   
 
Summary
Mankind is endangered. The Skrav have destroyed our sun and sent us into the depths of space. On the run our only hope lies in a place called the void. A place foretold by the nexus, an element that lets us see past, present, and future. Everywhere we go destruction follows. We have been running for 30,000 years. 
The war with the Skrav has been at a standstill for years now. Humans have settled on the colony Errikus, an alien colony and last stop before the empty space between the spirals in the milky way galaxy. Sev was born on this world but he wasn't made for it. His lungs aren't use to the open air, his eyes can't tolerate the natural light, and his mind is meant to be somewhere else. By age twelve the starship Erebus and Aelita leave with the last of mankind aboard.
Sev is a user. His life consists of living on the starship Erebus. Day in and day out he watches through the eyes of people who have died. People who haven't been born. It is through his eyes, his words, his actions this war will come to an end. Will he bring mankind to the end of our journey or will he be our fall.

Deep Darkness is full of different creatures. Some genetically altered others more exotic.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>During my many years teaching in the inner-city, I have had many memorable students. Some I remember were good students, some behavior problems, some courageous, and others were heartbreaking. I learned many lessons from these students and would like to be able to share my memories, outlook, and the way music had played a part in my teaching throughout the years. I feel I have a lot to offer the world. As my editor said, ""All educators should read that book! It's very moving, and your 37 years of teaching experience is priceless."" Even if you are not in the education field, you will be moved by the stories I share. You can make my retirement  dream come true by contributing!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>$1000 of the  funds will be used to publish my book in print and ebook format. The rest of the funds will be used to help me publicise the book and send out the perks. Any funds over the $1700 will be applied to the publishing of my next book, which is about half-written at this point.</p>
<p>Speaking of perks, some of them are really cool!<br/><br/>Depending on your level of contribution, you could receive a handwritten thank-you, an mp3 of my class singing an original song, a signed copy of the book,  acknowledgement in the book, an mp3 of my reading a chapter, or a 30 minute teaching consultation/interview via Skype. </p>

<h3>Snails In Hyperspace (PDF)</h3>
<p>I promise to send everyone who contributes or donates a PDF version of the short / introductory/ outline version of the book which is currently available on Amazon Kindle as a thank you.</p>
<p>I asked my friend Emeli to help me with my marketing. I have included my original pitch for those of you who want more information.</p>
<p>There is also more than one video related to this project on my YouTube channel. </p>
<p>I am deeply grateful for your contribution/ donation towards this project/ work.<br/><br/>With thanks,</p>
<p>Mark Ty-Wharton.</p>
<h2><strong>Emeli's marketing pitch:</strong></h2>
<p>Hello I am Mark Ty-Wharton and I am a writer. I am diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome (a high functioning form of Autism).</p>
<p>I have studied spirituality, enlightenment and personal development for over 30 years. In this, my latest book I have been able to bring together answers to some of our deepest questions about ‘who am I?’ and ‘why am I here?’ in a new, unique and yet incredibly simple way.</p>
<p>I would love the ideas in this book to be available to as many people as possible because they may just be able to transform the way you think about yourself and your life in a profoundly significant way.</p>
<p>If you have ever wondered what was the point to anything - really, then this is the book for you.</p>
<p>Written in an engaging, irreverent and downright hilarious way this book gives you the answers that no other will.</p>
<p>As a result of my finally experiencing a peace of mind and sense of belonging in the world I can now share that experience with you.</p>
<p>I really need your donation to get my book professionally edited so that you can read it.  </p>
<p>Profits from the finished book will be invested to help fund other projects by people with Autism.</p>
<p>I will be hugely grateful for all donations and if you believe in karma you know you will be eternally rewarded!</p>
<p> Before now I was always fighting against life. Looking for my own Individual answers. Living in a world that was all about me. An isolated prison of “Markness.”</p>
<p>This book and this entire campaign is actually about moving away from such an insular way of being into a world that embraces togetherness. A world where we can all help each other. And most especially a world where we can all help each other to express our greatest passions and play to our greatest strengths.</p>
<p>Writing this book has seen the end of my eternal seeking. It has resulted in a peace of mind, body and spirit that I would love to share with you.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be wonderful to live in a world like this?</p>
<p>Please help me get this book published. Be a part of this phenomenal ride. Check out the perks. Read the book.</p>

<h2><strong>My original pitch:</strong></h2>
<h3 class=""p1""><strong>Synopsis:</strong></h3>
<p class=""p2""><strong>Who am I?</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">For the sake of conversation, my name is Mark Ty-Wharton (aka Mark Tinley), I am a 49 year old writer diagnosed with asperger syndrome. This will be my third published book. </p>
<p class=""p2"">As a part of universal source energy, that which makes us all whole and complete, I am reqeusting your help to take my individual expression of writing to a new level; by paying for a professional book editor to work with me to finalise an existing manuscript for publication. Remaining funds will be used for promotion and to raise awareness.</p>
<p class=""p2"">As a person on the autistic spectrum, I see the world in a different way. I have been told my ideas can be of profound significance.</p>
<p class=""p2"">This campaign is about making those ideas accessible to as many people as possible.</p>
<p class=""p2"">My book contains a simple message, designed as a new path to lead <em>you the reader</em> to direct spiritual realization. Beyond answering the question ""Who Am I"" the book explains how you made the error of misidentification of ""self"" in the first place and sets things straight.</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>After some thirty years, perhaps more as a spiritual seeker...</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">After struggling to find a place in life, a purpose...</p>
<p class=""p2"">There is finally peace of mind, a sense of belonging...<span class=""s1""><br/><br/></span>This is life and you and I are living it!</p>
<h3 class=""p1""><strong>The Impact:</strong></h3>
<p class=""p2""><strong>What have you done for me lately?</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">Moving human beings away from an ego based environment to a more holistic environment nurtures a spirit of mutual growth and co-operation.</p>
<p class=""p2"">You can relax knowing that your hard earned donation is in the hands of someone who will use it to ultimately change the world into a better place.<span class=""s1""><br/><br/></span>I will treat your donation with the same respect that you would treat the money with yourself&gt; I will put your money to work for your karma and invest it in good will in the same way you would choose to do for yourself.</p>
<h3 class=""p1""><strong>Never Mind The Buzzcocks: What Do I Get?</strong></h3>
<p class=""p2""><strong>What You Will Get When You Contribute:</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">First and foremost, I promise to send you a PDF copy of the first book in the series which will give you a clear outline of the idea/work. </p>
<p class=""p2"">Secondly, a pre-requisite of being human, is an intrinsic need to find meaning and purpose in all that we do. One of the most significant ways humanity finds meaning in life is by making genuine contributions towards the wellbeing and growth of others.</p>
<p class=""p2"">One thing that leaves all of us with a sense of joy, is when we empower people less fortunate than ourselves, leaving them in a position where they can move forward with life.</p>
<p class=""p2""><strong>This campaign is not simply about helping one autistic person to write a book.</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">Revenue from the book will be used to fund other projects designed to help other adults with autism. These projects include a transport archive and museum and various sound art projects.</p>
<p class=""p2"">I am choosing to use crowd sourcing as funding so that I can work with a professional book editor / cover designer and create a single coherent and organised message throughout an entire book.</p>
<h3 class=""p2""><strong>Why edit at all?</strong></h3>
<p class=""p2"">Turning this book into a commercial success will provide funds to enable a number of other philanthropic enterprises to go ahead. </p>
<h3 class=""p1""><strong>Why do I need your help?</strong></h3>
<p class=""p2""><strong>So where do you fit in?</strong></p>
<p class=""p2"">Until now, I was fighting against life, looking for my own individual answers, inhabiting a me, me, me world, where only Mark mattered.</p>
<p class=""p2"">This campaign is about shifting away from an insular world and embracing a world where people can help one another to get along and express their aptitudes and passions.</p>
<p class=""p2"">Writing this book shares an idea born out of spiritual seeking, a path that a great many people have contributed to and completion acknowledges their contribution.</p>
<p class=""p1""><strong>Who Am I helping?</strong></p>
<p class=""p2""><em><strong>Your contribution will make a huge difference to a great many more people than just one autistic writer!</strong></em></p>
<p class=""p2"">This is not a new question to which there are certainly no absolute answers, yet this book, which is based on new evidence, provides unique perspectives and new insights.</p>
<p class=""p2"">This book is a comprehensive guide to something not immediately apparent in the common sense world view of things, yet gives straight no nonsense direct path knowledge to a full recognition of self and access consciousness.</p>
<h3 class=""p3""><strong>Other Ways You Can Help:</strong></h3>
<p class=""p2"">If you can’t contribute financially, you can spread the word via social networks like FaceBook, Google+ and Twitter using Indiegogo’s share tools.</p>
<p class=""p2"">A good campaign needs duration, frequency and impact.<span class=""s1""><br/><br/></span>By mentioning this campaign daily for the next thirty days (till the end of the campaign) you can increase the likelihood people willing to fund the project can come forward and make donations.<span class=""s1""><br/><br/></span>Mentioning the campaign frequently is very generous use of your time and I sincerley appreciate your efforts.<span class=""s1""><br/><br/></span>Kind regards.</p>

I am raising funds to support this time of transition in my journey and to fill the gap of my basic expenses until I receive my first paycheck in Korea, which is about a month after I arrive.  I will leave for South Korea once I receive my work visa in about 3-6 weeks.


The Beginnings of Gypsy WomanI bought a ticket to Europe in April of 2011.  I had lost all of my personal belongings to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and then again in 2010 to a leaky storage unit.  My cat ran away, my car broke down beyond repair, and I had to move. It seemed it was time to take a leap and do something... different.

I traveled first to Germany.  I had a connection through my practice of Reiki, a traditional Japanese healing art, at a Seminar Haus owned and run by Reiki Masters.  I was welcomed there and stayed for an extended visit working in exchange for room and board.  With very little money in my bank account but a desire to extend my time and life lessons in Europe, I discovered the website helpx.net.  Helpx is an online listing of hosts all over the world who invite volunteer helpers to stay with them in exchange for food and accommodation.  Through helpx, I was able to extend and diversify my time in Europe.

Teaching English in South KoreaWhile traveling in Europe I began to question, what is next? Appreciating the beauty and lessons of travel, I wanted to continue on my journey.  The practicality of life and finances demanded that I explore ways to earn an income.  I began researching positions teaching English as a Second Language and was delighted to find the job listing at the Gyeonggi English Village in South Korea.  With my background in Education and interest in experiential education, I was attracted to their non-traditional and fun style of teaching and camp-like setting.

I took a leap, applied and was offered a position.  I returned to the States about three months ago to begin the long process of acquiring a work visa for South Korea.  That process will be complete in the next 3 - 6 weeks and I will be on my way!

Coming Home to MeThe upheaval and change in my life continues to reinforce that no matter where I am, I can always practice coming home to me - coming home to that which is greater than any house, or set of belongings or location. Not always easy.

I rely on spiritual practices including the Usui Shiki Ryoho tradition of Reiki.  I am a yoga student and participate in the activities and practices of The Art of Living Organization led by Indian Guru Sri Sri Ravi Shankar.  I am also a member of the Buddhist group Soka Gakkai International.  These spiritual practices form the backbone of my life, no matter where I travel. The organizations behind them foster a sense of community and home all over the world.
I have also been challenged, nurtured and supported by the people and programs of Landmark Education, particularly the Wisdom Course and Community.  I was in the Landmark Forum in Houston,Texas the weekend that Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans.  They are steadfast supporters of ""anything is possible"" and gave me a platform from which to learn and practice ""taking leaps"" in the face of uncertainty.

Request for FundingThe lessons and growth of travel have been rich and plenty, but after traveling and living very simply in Europe for a year and half, it is time to “replenish the well.” I am seeking funding to support this time of transition in my journey and fill the gap of my basic expenses until I receive my first paycheck in South Korea, about a month after I arrive.

Here is my budget:

$250  -  For Food/Household products from the States to Bring to South Korea


$300  -  For Shoes/Clothing purchases in the States for a year of working and living in Korea (I am told the largest shoe size in Korea is a 7)

$250 - Vitamins and Personal Items from the States to Bring to South Korea

$350  -  Living Expenses until I depart for South Korea


$150  -  Travel Money for Trip to Korea (airfare is paid by GEV) 

$200  -  Emergency Money/Incidental Expenses

$1000  -  Living Expenses for First Month in Korea (as estimated by staff at GEV)

Total funds requested:  $2500

First of all, thank you for checking out my campaign! My hopes and dreams are that the Loving Me series will get funded by YOU so together we can take the books to the next level as well as get as many books into the hands of children in Ghana!! 
I am on a mission to help kids realize that bright red hair with tinted freckles, or bleach blond hair with crystal blue eyes, or the darkest hue of chocolaty skin with awesome kinky hair are all the things that make this world a fun and interesting place! There are no mistakes! We are all born unique on purpose!

I embrace differences and I want kids to get excited about who they are today! 
 
 

SPLASH OF INFO ON THE 'LOVING ME SERIES': 
 
The Loving Me Series is told through they eyes of a little girl and boy who discover all the things they love most about themselves! The message of self-love is a Universal one! I love to perform with my team (reading, drumming, dancing, etc) and see the light bulbs go off for little kids who learn how cool it is to be who they are!

MY OBSTACLE:  
On my way to becoming an independently published success story, unbeknownst to me, my distributor was a misbehaving one, (code for liar and cheat), who accepted my shipment of books, admittedly used the profit from their sales to keep his own company afloat, commented on how effortlessly they sold themselves, and refused to forward me my portion of those sales. 
Needless to say, he has ceased communicating with me. The funds were to be used for the expansion of the  brands (ie. to obtain a patent for a loving me product, the release my new book and to have merchandise available for all the fans & supporters). I don't want this disappointing incident to end my journey, so I'm trying to keep my head above water, but financially, it is quite challenging to do so as a self-published author.

New goal for 2013!
I recently joined forces with a George Brown College Professor's organization called 'Links Across Boarders'. She has been working hard trying to get books into as many children's hands as possible in Ghana! So, for every 2 high five perks that are selected, 1 book will go into the hands of a child in Ghana!
As well, I have added a perk specifically for those who are interested in making a difference this Black History Month. Selecting the Thunderbolt Perk instantly places a book from the Loving Me Series (your choice of the boy/girl version) into a box that will be shipped out at the end of this February 2013 by Links Across Boarders!
MANY PEOPLE ARE NATURAL GIVERS, I'M A GIVER TOO! SO PLEASE CHECK OUT THE PERKS SECTION TO SEE WHAT I TOO, WILL GIVE TO YOU!!
NO MATTER HOW SMALL OR HOW GREAT, IT IS APPRECIATED.

<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: medium; font-weight: normal;"">The Oakland Poetry Slam was founded in 1999 by a small group of Bay Area writers committed to bringing poetry to the sunny side of The Bay. In that very first year the rookie team Oakland reached Finals at The National Poetry Slam (NPS), ultimately finishing the tournament as the 4th ranked team in the nation. After the squad's triumphant return, the Slam took off and took on a life of it's own! Here we are, more than a decade later and Oakland hasn't missed a Nationals yet.</span></p>
<h3><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""3"">The Impact: </font></h3>
<p><span class=""Apple-style-span"" style=""font-size: medium; font-weight: normal;"">Oakland gets a bad rap, a terrible rap actually. If you'd never been here and only listened to national news outlets, you'd think this was a horrible cesspool of drug addled gang-bangers and crack babies. As residents we know better; we know ""the Town"" is a vibrant hotbed of creativity and continually on the cultural cutting edge. Oakland is a shining jewl, it's an international mecca of people, food, languages, culture and art. It's a city brimming with artists, entertainers and people of all types. Sure, we have our share of issues - what city doesn't? </span></p>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""3"">As residents we feel it imperative that Oakland's voice be heard by the widest possible audience. That's why we need YOU to help! Without generous patrons of the arts like yourself there is simply no way that we'd be able to get the team to Boston and back to show the rest of the nation what Oakland has to offer. We have a fabulous team of poets this year; it would be an absolute travesty for us to not be able to make the trip because of money.</font></p>
<h3><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""3"">What We Need: </font></h3>
<p><font class=""Apple-style-span"" size=""3"">All told it'll take about $5,000 to register for Nationals, fly the team to Boston and house them while there. We'll also be self-publishing a collection of poetry and creating a DVD featuring performances from team members to aid in fundraising.

Either way %100 of your donation will go to the expenses listed here.

<h3><span class=""text""><span class=""style52""> <br/></span></span></h3>
<p><span class=""text""><span class=""style52"">I almost let it go.  Almost.  It takes so much out of me to create the books, as well as everything associated with it.  But it's hard to stop doing something you love, and are passionate about, and knowing especially that it helps others.</span></span></p>
<p><span class=""text""><span class=""style52"">It has not been without its challenges, including creating time while also raising a family and three children, as well as recovering from a disabilitating disease called necrotizing fasciitis which appeared in 2009 during writing of my third book.  It nearly claimed my left arm and has taken years to rehabilitate into good health.  However, I have not been able to work during this time and creativity is there, but other things are not... the thing that makes this type of independent project go... funding.<br/></span></span></p>

<p><span class=""text""><span class=""style52"">For the first several books, I also donated 10% of my book sales to the charity Kids Help Phone, which went to provide someone at the other end of the phone or internet for kids who may be in trouble.  Part of the topics I write about in my book series (aside from the paranormal) are difficult teen topics others would not dare to attempt.  But I have had many teens confide in me with some of their problems and life for them is still challenging, more so than it was years ago.  I want to create books that they are also passionate about!  I want to build a world inside of the series that they can relate to and open their minds to new and fantastical possibilities!  I love the artwork and poetry done by others, that has come back to me, inspired by my series.  I have featured many poems and artwork in and on the covers of the books.  It's not just my dream being fulfilled, but countless others.  <br/></span></span></p>
<p><span class=""text""><span class=""style52"">I also give talks to teens about writing and the process it takes to become an author.  I would like to further get my book series into the library system and give book readings and talks to teens in the libraries as well.<br/></span></span></p>

<li>Word programs &amp; Adobe Pro (required to create the book covers)</li>
<li>Fonts</li>
<li>Marketing materials such as postcards and business cards</li>
<li>Proofs - books created prior to the final print to check for spacing, page layout, editing errors, etc.  Each book typically has 2-3 proofs come to me before I send the final print.</li>
<li>Uploading fees - to print the book, there are fees associated with the uploads and formatting to create the book and have it printed on quality paper</li>
<li>a working Computer, Printer and office space - I work on a very old computer and it threatens to crash repeatedly - it's time for an updated one</li>
<li>Insurance</li>
<li>Webdesign and hosting</li>
<li>Table fees for book fairs and events</li>
<li>and sometimes the events themselves, such as the Haunted Book Parties - reserving the space, entertainers, food, etc.</li>

<h3>Lend a hand.  Support a good cause.  Make the dream a reality.</h3>
<p>Many who know me know that I have often been very generous, donating books, bartering books.  It's just who I am.  I see someone who wants to read, but can't pay, and I often want to lend them a hand.  It's good karma.  It's reciprocal.  I do believe that what energy we do put out often comes back to us. </p>
<p>I would love to be able to give back to those who contribute to my campaign.  I've created special 'perks' that will encourage as well as help you to create this dream into a reality.  One special perk includes letting me write a character for you.  I've done it in the past.  It can be quite fun finding yourself in a book!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can’t contribute, that doesn’t mean you can’t help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the word out and make some noise about this great campaign!  How exciting to know an author and especially one that wants to encourage teens to read and write their own journeys!</li>
<li>Share this on Facebook.</li>

<h3><span class=""text""><span class=""style52"">Author</span> <span class=""style44"">Kristin Groulx</span> <span class=""style52"">writes paranormal young adult romances, chick-lit and paranormal thrillers. With a flare for the mysterious, a fascination with magic, and a passion for discovering love in its many forms, Kristin knew it was only natural to write fiction. She is also no stranger to traveling, having lived and explored the United States, Asia and Canada. <br/><br/> Her real life ghostly encounters are incorporated into her novels, and present a direct look at uncommon paranormal experiences. For the past decade, Kristin has dug up extensive genealogical research, ranging from tiptoeing around cemeteries and rummaging betwixt pages of census records. Her direct lineage includes several writers, journalists and editors, and perhaps even a few cauldron-brewing witches. But that last part we’ll let you decide. <br/><br/> Her latest adventure in writing is perfect for a teen audience of ages 13-18. The Alyson Bell series deals with some pretty dark topics, and although set in a magical setting, readers will have no trouble identifying personal situations they can relate to.</span></span></h3>

I almost let it go.  Almost.  It takes so much out of me to create the books, as well as everything associated with it.  But it's hard to stop doing something you love, and are passionate about, and knowing especially that it helps others.
It has not been without its challenges, including creating time while also raising a family and three children, as well as recovering from a disabilitating disease called necrotizing fasciitis which appeared in 2009 during writing of my third book.  It nearly claimed my left arm and has taken years to rehabilitate into good health.  However, I have not been able to work during this time and creativity is there, but other things are not... the thing that makes this type of independent project go... funding.

For the first several books, I also donated 10% of my book sales to the charity Kids Help Phone, which went to provide someone at the other end of the phone or internet for kids who may be in trouble.  Part of the topics I write about in my book series (aside from the paranormal) are difficult teen topics others would not dare to attempt.  But I have had many teens confide in me with some of their problems and life for them is still challenging, more so than it was years ago.  I want to create books that they are also passionate about!  I want to build a world inside of the series that they can relate to and open their minds to new and fantastical possibilities!  I love the artwork and poetry done by others, that has come back to me, inspired by my series.  I have featured many poems and artwork in and on the covers of the books.  It's not just my dream being fulfilled, but countless others.  
I also give talks to teens about writing and the process it takes to become an author.  I would like to further get my book series into the library system and give book readings and talks to teens in the libraries as well.
 

 
Many goals.  One dream.  A heart filled with inspiration.
 
Some of the costs incurred for an author and publisher include:

Clip art and graphics royalties (paying artists for their work)
Graphics programs for editing and creating book covers and inside artwork
Word programs & Adobe Pro (required to create the book covers)
Fonts
Marketing materials such as postcards and business cards
Proofs - books created prior to the final print to check for spacing, page layout, editing errors, etc.  Each book typically has 2-3 proofs come to me before I send the final print.
Uploading fees - to print the book, there are fees associated with the uploads and formatting to create the book and have it printed on quality paper
a working Computer, Printer and office space - I work on a very old computer and it threatens to crash repeatedly - it's time for an updated one
Insurance
Webdesign and hosting
Table fees for book fairs and events
and sometimes the events themselves, such as the Haunted Book Parties - reserving the space, entertainers, food, etc.

 

Lend a hand.  Support a good cause.  Make the dream a reality.
Many who know me know that I have often been very generous, donating books, bartering books.  It's just who I am.  I see someone who wants to read, but can't pay, and I often want to lend them a hand.  It's good karma.  It's reciprocal.  I do believe that what energy we do put out often comes back to us. 
I would love to be able to give back to those who contribute to my campaign.  I've created special 'perks' that will encourage as well as help you to create this dream into a reality.  One special perk includes letting me write a character for you.  I've done it in the past.  It can be quite fun finding yourself in a book!

A little more about me:
Author Kristin Groulx writes paranormal young adult romances, chick-lit and paranormal thrillers. With a flare for the mysterious, a fascination with magic, and a passion for discovering love in its many forms, Kristin knew it was only natural to write fiction. She is also no stranger to traveling, having lived and explored the United States, Asia and Canada.  Her real life ghostly encounters are incorporated into her novels, and present a direct look at uncommon paranormal experiences. For the past decade, Kristin has dug up extensive genealogical research, ranging from tiptoeing around cemeteries and rummaging betwixt pages of census records. Her direct lineage includes several writers, journalists and editors, and perhaps even a few cauldron-brewing witches. But that last part we’ll let you decide.  Her latest adventure in writing is perfect for a teen audience of ages 13-18. The Alyson Bell series deals with some pretty dark topics, and although set in a magical setting, readers will have no trouble identifying personal situations they can relate to.",4.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>My name is Hannah Haddadi and I have something to say. </p>
<p>I am a Denver based Poet, who is ready to expose her soul to the world. I go to school for integrative medicine, counseling, and above all - healing. There are many different ways in which the body, soul, and heart heal. There are also many different ways in which this healing can be ignited or inspired. This campaign is extremely important to me because I have found for myself that speaking my truth ignites the healing that I need. I am ready to share this piece of myself with others, in hopes that they find what supports their own being. </p>
<h3><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>I have recorded enough poems to make an EP at this point however, I need some help to keep the momentum of this project going and in so, to be able to finish it whole-heartedly.</p>
<p>I spent a weekend up at the beautiful Evergroove studio in Evergreen, where I was honored to be able to work with Brad Smalling. Surrounded by wise trees, I felt supported by mother nature herself and look forward to finishing the album again in this environment.</p>
<p>Contributors will help support the mixing and mastering of the album, website startup, as well as gaining the support and collaboration with fellow local musicians to record alongside my poetry; those of Tom Hagerman, Julie Stratton, and Gina Massaro of Amphibian. I am honored to get the chance to work with such talented musicians and people who I respect dearly,</p>
<p>At this point, the album will be able via internet media avenues however if enough money is raised, my dream of creating physical copies could become a reality. Funds raised will go directly to the final mixing and mastering costs of the album, and anything left over will be transferred to physical production costs.</p>
<p>Those who are gracious enough to donate to my cause and my dream will not only be able to see this project unfold beautifully, but also receive perks! Donor perks will be specific to the amount donated, however these include personalized post cards, free downloads of the album, and personalized 'thank you' bundles!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We all are trying to figure out how we can make a difference in this world. For me, soliciting and encouraging healing of all different types is what I strive to do. It is a learning process however, I believe that we are all capable of healing and that our bodies and our beings have an innate healing capacity of their own. Creating poetry and putting myself and my work out into the world is as much of a healing modality for myself inside as it is to the external world. </p>
<p>Working on this project has made me feel empowered, vulnerable, and a little bit crazy! It is important for myself to put my words out into the universe and with no regrets. </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div><div>
<p>If you can't necessarily donate that doesn't mean that you cannot help my cause! You can still help by sharing my dream and campaign with others! </p>
<p>You can also help by simply doing whatever it is that you need to ignite and support your own healing. This is turn helps not only your own self but the world.   </p>
<p>Thank you for stopping by and taking the time to read about my dream!</p>
<p>Love, Hannah. </p>

Donor perks will be specific to the amount donated, however these include personalized post cards, free downloads of the album, and personalized 'thank you' bundles!

The Impact
We all are trying to figure out how we can make a difference in this world. For me, soliciting and encouraging healing of all different types is what I strive to do. It is a learning process however, I believe that we are all capable of healing and that our bodies and our beings have an innate healing capacity of their own. Creating poetry and putting myself and my work out into the world is as much of a healing modality for myself inside as it is to the external world. 
Working on this project has made me feel empowered, vulnerable, and a little bit crazy! It is important for myself to put my words out into the universe and with no regrets. 
Other Ways You Can Help

If you can't necessarily donate that doesn't mean that you cannot help my cause! You can still help by sharing my dream and campaign with others! 
You can also help by simply doing whatever it is that you need to ignite and support your own healing. This is turn helps not only your own self but the world.   
Thank you for stopping by and taking the time to read about my dream!

<p>  One year ago, we launched <a href=""www.freezeraypoetry.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">FreezeRay</a>, an online poetry journal dedicated to the intersection of literature and pop culture.  We made the name a difficult compound word with weird capitalization.   One year and four online issues later, the response from both readers and contributors was greater than we could have hoped for.</p>
<p>Welcome to the launch of the newest poetry publisher, FreezeRay Press.   We're keeping the FreezeRay name because our press is basically the journal on paper (and maybe if we're ambitious, we'll put out a Best Of The Journal...on paper).   Our books will have a pop culture focus and a whole lot of great poetry.</p>
<p>What we're doing here is unveiling our entire line-up of titles for 2015 and allowing you to pre-order as many or as few as you like.   These authors and editors were hand-picked to give you a sense of the aesthetic we love at FreezeRay, poets and writers who embrace pop culture with a critical eye and a fan's heart.</p>
<p>In addition to amazing chapbooks by Dalton Day, Ellyn Touchette, Stephen Meads, and Laura Swearingen-Steadwell, we're also publishing a number of collections and anthologies covering the entire spectrum of pop culture.  Hanif Abdurraqib's AGAIN I WAIT FOR THIS TO PULL APART is a poetry anthology dedicated to pop musicians and the pull they have on our lives.  The editorial staff of <a href=""www.blacknerdproblems.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Black Nerd Problems</a> will be collecting the best of their website's editorials and thinkpieces.  The intersection of video games and literature will be explored by the editors of <a href=""www.cartridgelit.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Cartridge Lit</a>.And the end of the year will be asking for your submissions to a <a href=""http://www.freezeraypress.com/-horror-ku.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Horror-Ku anthology</a> and an anthology inspired by science fiction flicks, LIT CAME FROM OUTER SPACE (edited by Alan Passman and Rob Sturma).</p>
<p>For what we're calling ""Season One"", each first printing of these books will come with an exclusive collectible trading card based on the subject matter presented.  We'd love for you to collect them all.</p>
<p>There will be a regular release schedule during 2015 so we can properly promote and give each release time to breathe before we hit you with another blast of pop goodness.</p>
<p>And of course, we're offering discounts for Season One subscriptions, or package deals so you can grab a number of titles that you want for less.</p>
<p>We'd love to spread the nerd gospel far and wide, and as a side goal, get these books into hands of people who never realized that pop culture and literature could be so simpatico.  Help us get launched, and we'll put these words out into the world!</p>

</div> <p>Divorced Mamma of two sporty teenagers meets Divorced Pappa of two adorable little girls and they discover that they have a lot in common!</p>
<p>They fall in love and realize that everything they ever wanted was within reach. Family is everything to Michelle (a Reflexologist) and Dvir (freelance Translator) . Not only do they get along really well, but their four children ranging from 4 to 14 yrs old get along really well, it all just clicks and they are VERY happy.</p>
<p>Living almost 100 kms apart makes meeting up difficult and they both dream of having a real family.

 Divorced Mamma of two sporty teenagers meets Divorced Pappa of two adorable little girls and they discover that they have a lot in common!
They fall in love and realize that everything they ever wanted was within reach. Family is everything to Michelle (a Reflexologist) and Dvir (freelance Translator) . Not only do they get along really well, but their four children ranging from 4 to 14 yrs old get along really well, it all just clicks and they are VERY happy.
Living almost 100 kms apart makes meeting up difficult and they both dream of having a real family. This drive to create a loving home and be the best parents they can be is what gives seed to the dream of moving to a house in the country, closer to Dvir's young girls so that he can spend as much time with them as possible.

<p>Allerede i februar ba vi som jobber i Rødt om et møte for å få avklart hvilke kriterier de la til grunn for partilederdebatter og annen valgdekning. Det ble utsatt i flere runder, og 2. juni hadde vi endelig møte med dem. I forkant ba vi også om å få tilsendt kriteriene skriftlig. Det fikk vi ikke, de sa de ville vente og forklare dem muntlig på møtet.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h4><b>Uklar begrunnelse</b></h4>På møtet oppga NRK følgende kriterium: Man må være stortingsparti. Vi spurte: Men det er jo lokalvalg? <br/>De sa: Ja, men det har vi bestemt. Og denne debatten mellom partilederne er ikke så farlig, siden det er lokale saker og kandidater som avgjør. <br/>Vi sa: Nettopp fordi det er et lokalvalg er det vel litt rart å ha krav om å være stortingsparti? <br/>De svarte: Det kan du si, men hvis dere går opp på målingene inn mot valgdagen kan det være dere får være med likevel.<br/>Vi sa: Så det er ikke krav om å være stortingsparti likevel?<br/>De svarte: Jo, på en måte, men må ha målinger som gjør det sannsynlig å komme inn.<br/>Vi sa: Så hva må vi ha som månedlig snitt de siste månedene før valget for å få være med?<br/>De sa: Det kan vi ikke gi noe tall på nå. Kanskje seinere. Kanskje aldri. <br/>Og omtrent sånn gikk det rundt og rundt.<br/><br/><h3>Hva betyr utestengelsen for Rødt?</h3>
<p>Det betyr to ting: <br/>1. Bjørnar Moxnes får ikke delta i partilederdebattene på NRK som åpner og avslutter valgkampen.<br/>2. Rødt blir ""usynlige"" i valgomaten. Valgomaten funker slik: Først svarer du på 15 påstander om nasjonal politikk. Ut fra svarene får du vite hvilket parti du er mest enig med. Her vil <i>ikke</i> NRK la deg få vite det hvis du er mest enig med Rødt.</p>
<p>Deretter <i>kan</i> du velge å gå videre til en lokal del, med 5 spørsmål som handler om saker i din kommune. Når du har svart på de 5 lokale spørsmålene, kan Rødt dukke opp som partiet du er mest enig i.</p>

Hvorfor 10.000 dollar?


For 10.000 USD (litt over 70.000 kr) kan vi via sosiale medier nå ut til like mange som vi mister når NRK utestenger oss. Beløpet er i dollar fordi Indiegogo ikke lar oss samle inn i norske kroner.
