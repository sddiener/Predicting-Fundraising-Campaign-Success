<b><u>We want to tell you the story behind TRIVOLTY</u></b>
</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
            Currently TRIVOLTY is based in Estonia.
            The company was founded by Tihon Morozevich, Max Artyukhov and Olga Burdukovksaya.
            The idea for the TRIVOLTY project came to them a year ago.
        </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
            We came up with the idea for Trivolty when faced with the dilemma of finding a unique gift for our be loved persons.
            What do you buy for the person that has everything?
        </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
            After a lot of work designing together, the idea became a beautiful concept.
            With the support of ARTKB, we have come a long way from the conception of an idea to the sample pilot production.
        </p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1437771185/qecclscvwzt0ufhlacax.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>        </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
            A present is a thing we give our friends and family with a special tenderness and pleasure.
            Giving a gift should inspire joy and surprise. 
            We believe that the Trivolty Crystal will be a touching gift for any loved one.
        </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">
            The TRIVOLTY Crystal has moved into the next stage of development due to initial enthusiasm about this innovative product.
        </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">
<b><u>Estimated Development Time</u></b>

            The TRIVOLTY crystal consists of a light unit, a transparent colorless glass and a supporting element.
            A cylinder-shaped light unit is comprised of batteries, a touch sensor, a LED line, and plastic end caps provided with mini-USB connectors to charge batteries. 
        




            When you touch one of the end caps the LEDs flash on, the second touch turns them off.
            When the batteries are charged by the mini-USB cable, LEDs are on all the time.
        

            The LED lights highlight your beautiful image of a choice.
        




We want to tell you the story behind TRIVOLTY


            Currently TRIVOLTY is based in Estonia.
            The company was founded by Tihon Morozevich, Max Artyukhov and Olga Burdukovksaya.
            The idea for the TRIVOLTY project came to them a year ago.
        

            We came up with the idea for Trivolty when faced with the dilemma of finding a unique gift for our be loved persons.
            What do you buy for the person that has everything?
        

            After a lot of work designing together, the idea became a beautiful concept.
            With the support of ARTKB, we have come a long way from the conception of an idea to the sample pilot production.
                

            A present is a thing we give our friends and family with a special tenderness and pleasure.
            Giving a gift should inspire joy and surprise. 
            We believe that the Trivolty Crystal will be a touching gift for any loved one.
        

            The TRIVOLTY Crystal has moved into the next stage of development due to initial enthusiasm about this innovative product.
        

Estimated Development Time


            We are now preparing to begin producing the TRIVOLTY crystal.
            We need your help to develop TRIVOLTY and start mass production. 
        

            You'll be the first to receive TRIVOLTY crystal at a price significantly less than future retail price.
            We hope that you like the TRIVOLTY!
        

            We use advanced technology that has already been tested and developed by many other companies.
            The whole production process is monitored at the highest level by well-known professionals in their field. 
        

            We provide full lifetime warranty of the transparent colorless glass with laser engraved image inside if there is no any mechanical damages.
        

            Warranty period of the light unit and the supporting element is 1 year.
            In the case of any problems, send your light unit or the supporting element to us for repair or replacement. 
        

            You will have the option in the future to order the transparent colorless or the light unit separately if a repair is needed. 
        

            We will return your money if you receive a broken or damaged TRIVOLTY crystal.
        




            We understand how important our work is, and we understand that our terms of production and date of delivery may change.
            We will cover all stages of production, so you will be informed of the course of work and the date of delivery. 
        

            Upon successful completion of the campaign, follow the updates section on this page, on our website and our social networks.

When I was nine years old I was on the national television show, Dragons Den, with my card game: Doogoods. Doogoods is a card game that teaches kids to do good in simple ways in their homes schools and communities. But see, the thing with cards is that they are kind of growing out of style and everyone has a phone instead these days. I am now fifteen years old and I am currently creating a Doogoods app. The Doogoods App is an app where people of all ages can complete simple acts of kindness and in doing so receive points. They can also level up in their overall Doogooder Status as well as in the various categories such as Environmentalist Doogooder or Social Doogooder. The Doogoods App will make kindness a fun game while making a real difference in the world. It will get kids doing good and create habits so that we can raise the next generation as UPstanders instead of bystanders. Not only am I creating this app, but I am also going to be doing a speaking tour to further spread the Doogoods movement where I will give assemblies at elementary schools to inspire and empower the next generation. The thing is, to do so I need your help. If I am able to reach $10,000 in funds I will be able to build the Doogoods app and get it on the app store, and I will also go to 10 different elementary schools for free.

We aim to provide the same take-away experience as our MOFT invisible laptop stand, which was successfully funded earlier this year with 36,000+ backers on Kickstarter and Indiegogo.      Scientific research indicates that smartphone users hold their phones vertically about 94% of the time. Sadly, however, most of the attachable stands on the market are only designed with horizontal angles.   60° is perfect when you stand it up, You need an angle to help you read these vertical contents in clarity & comfort, so we got the best one --- 60°. It has the best viewing angle when you are in the business, the best ergonomics when you interact with it. Whether it's Facial unlock, video chat, messaging, news browsing…At 60°, you can totally do anything we mentioned just now, hands-free. But doing all this is not enough. We want to make sure you can do it anywhere, at any time. Simply fold it in your hands and take it wherever you go, no strings attached.  Don't get us wrong. Being good on vertical mode doesn't mean landscape mode is forgotten. As a heavy media content consumer, we know exactly how fast you want to switch when you feeling watching a video from a link---in a comfortable way. That's it. No fidgeting, no pulling or anything gimmicky, it just works. It also comes with 60° in landscape mode, perfect to watch in mid-range distance.Most of the attachable phone stand in the market doesn't support vertical angle; the ones that supports are usually very bulky, you can't take it with you easily.  For MOFT X, a simple yet very ergonomic fold-line on the back is enough to make it function perfectly, go with you all the time but unaware of its existence, and help you kick it up in just 1 second---even your cat knows how to use it.   It is also very thin and light. At 5mm/0.15inch thinness & 1oz weight, you won't even feel it in your pocket.  As a stand, it must get the job done properly before anything else. As thin as MOFT X phone stand can be, you will be amazed that such a small body still packs up to three cards. Your driving license, your credit card, your name card. Don’t worry, we got RF-ID, all your cards are safe and sound.  Remember the times when your hands are tied up by other stuff, but you still want to use your phone? With our magnetic sticky pad, you can now use your phone hands-free when you feel like going to wardrobe, to driving, cooking, or taking a bath.    An extra stand on the back will keep your phone on your hand like a magnet. No more worries when you try to use it on un-wieldy angles.   We found the perfect glue for the stand that can be removed from your phone stand without leaving a single mark or scratch, while still being tough and strong to endure all kinds of pulling and tearing.     Tablets are only one step away from being a 2nd screen for your laptops --- a right angle. Nobody wants to look back and forth for different tasks. MOFT X tablet stand offers up to 8 angles that nobody can refuse to work with. Browsing, sketching, reading... We save the possibilities to you to find out, all you need to know is, they work.Portrait mode is usually for web-browsing, reading, hand-writing, and video chatting. Through a simple fold-line and change of direction, MOFT X tablet stand is the only one in the market that offers 3 angles to make sure you complete the tasks in most postures, most distances, and most comfortable way. Landscape mode works best with media content. videos, games, art creations, etcs. With the help of a smart ""v"" line, you can also have 3 angles that keep all the contents crispy to eyes, and all the drawings smooth to hands.Switching between portrait/landscape mode takes one second, finding the best angle in that mode takes another one. You are always only two seconds away from your best viewing angle.  We also came up with an idea of tik-tok mode, which enables 1-second instant message sharing between two or more colleagues/family members/friends.   Communicating messages should be elegant & efficient.Clip to charge, easy to store, and full protection from head to toe.  The reinforced magnet helps your apple pencil to stay attached (esp. Apple Pencil 1), and the sturdy material offers effective protection for your fragile pencil tip & body. It also charges Apple Pencil 2 on the go.  As a member of MOFT X series, the tablet stand also packs a lot of content in a slim body. Here's how it looks like when compared to a regular iPad case.It perfects your iPad with contents, not weight.  To make sure it holds all kinds of tablets with ease, we also conducted several tests on the durability of our tablet stand.

We did a successful kickstarter campaign late last year and launched  Dash Reader Type-C in February. Dash-i shares the same outer casing with Dash Type-C and thus has the same form-factor except for different connectors. However, Dash-i involves a lot more work since Apple added its proprietary layer to USB storage access, and we need to develop a companion App to work with it.</p><p>Here is an inside look of the PCBA's for Dash Type-C and Dash-i with Lightning connector: while Dash Type-C uses just a single USB storage IC chip, Dash-i requires 3 IC chips.</p><p></p><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img alt=""PCBA: Dash-i prototype vs. Dash Type-C pre-production"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/005/604/840/ffdc1cac7431aebba09b295f3ce7c734_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1459149822&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=3398919ee68353483ec1b5ee1569da0c"" src="""" style=""""/><figcaption>PCBA: Dash-i prototype vs. Dash Type-C pre-production</figcaption></figure><p></p><p><i><b>Current Status.</b> </i>CAD &amp; board designs for both Dash-i &amp; Dash-i Plus have been done.

</div><p>Delay is always a possibility. As a responsible project creator, we only launch a campaign after we have the done the design, prototype and testing of prototypes. Delivery date estimate is based on the time required to finish the remaining work: tooling, pilot production run, production. We often factor-in some time for some possible delay causes. However, there may be something that we fail to foresee or we fail to estimate accurately the required time and they lead to delay in project completion.

Ever want to store some video/movies on your iPhone/iPad to watch on a trip so you don't spend big $s on your mobile bill or for places where you can't get connected to the ""cloud""? Ever want to share files easily among different devices and with family/friends?If you say Yes to any of these, then this is for you: a MicroSD card reader for iOS devices that gives you unlimited external storage accessible from your iPhone, iPad (including iPad Pro), and iPod Touch with Lightning port. You can have as much space as you want/need for music, video, photos, and any other types of files; and you can easily share the files with family/friends and among different devices (PC, Mac, Android, digital camera).Need to charge your iPhone/iPad while watching a movie stored on a MicroSD card? No problem, our Dash-i Plus has a MicroUSB charging port -- you can charge it using a MicroUSB charging cable while using the reader. This is a first for mobile expandable storage.Both Dash-i and Dash-i Plus will be MFi (Made for iPod/Phone/iPad) certified by Apple Inc. They are guaranteed to be compatible with all iOS releases, and all iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch devices with Lightning port.MicroSD Card: Universal, Unlimited Storage, Cheap, and SmallWe designed this MicroSD card reader instead of USB flash drive because we believe MicroSD is the best expandable storage solution. It is universal: you can use it on pretty much any devices: computers, tablets, digital cameras; and now, on iPhone/iPad using our Dash-i reader. It is everywhere -- very likely you get a few of them lying around somewhere. Fill-up one card? Just have another one.Design: Compact, Simplistic, ElegantDesign is the soul of a product. We have put a great deal of effort in designing Dash-i. The result is a little device that is refreshingly different and stands out from the rest of available solutions.
Small & compact: easy to carry around so it is always there; say no to bulky over-sized space taker.
Simplistic in both functionalities and form: do what it is supposed to do and do it well, in a simplistic form reflecting its functionalities.
Elegant & beautiful: looking good as a compliment to your mobile device.
Truly portable: silicone protective case included, use it to attach to a key ring.
Coin size; small, compact, thin.Attach it to a key ring, take it anywhere you go.Dash-i Plus: still small, with the added benefit of concurrent charging via a MicroUSB charging port.Functionality: Software Makes the DifferenceSoftware is what makes Dash-i tick. We aim to be the best expandable storage solution for iOS -- not only in terms of form factor & design, but also in terms of functionalities provided via software.Plug & PlayOn PC or Mac, insert a MicroSD card into your computer's built-in card reader or an external one, access it as you normally do. Insert the card into Dash-i and plug it into your iPhone/iPad, the Dash-i companion App will be launched -- which provides an intuitive and easy to use interface for you to manage the storage on the card and use other functionalities. Photos/videos: back them up, never run out of space for moreThe vacation pictures/videos take up all the precious storage space of you iPhone? No problem, move them to a MicroSD card using Dash-i. Free up the space, you are free to take a lot more.Music: carry your whole music collection with youYour iPhone is your best music player, except for the music that is left out because there is no space for it. Not any more, just pop in a MicroSD card with your whole music collection.Dahs-i's built-in Music Player plays standard mp3 or mpa music, and high-fidelity music in loss-less formats such as FLAC and APE. Currently we are developing Dash-i App into a full-featured music player: organize & play music by artists, albums, playlists etc.Movies: take a movie for the road trip, or 2,  or 3, ...A 200GB MicroSD card will store 200 hours full-HD videos/movies -- enough for all the vacation videos, plus all the episodes of Game of Thrones, plus all Transformers movies, plus a whole lot more. Play them all on the best movie player, your iPad. Dash-i's built-in video player supports a wide range of video formats, including mov, mp4, avi, mkv, rmv, vob.Any Files: view/edit, share, transfer ...MicroSD card works on pretty much every computing device and many different electronic devices: computer/laptop/tablet/phone, smart TV, digital camera, mp3/video player, voice recorder, copy/fax machine. Dash-i makes it work on your iPhone/iPad too. One media to rule them all.Dash-i: Cost-Effective, Stands Out of the PackDash-i is also the most cost-effective expandable storage solution.Feature-wise, we believe Dash-i is the best of them all.In addition to features listed above, while storage capacity is limited by the what you purchased for flash-drive based solution, Dash-i allows you to have unlimited storage capacity by using more MicroSD cards.The JourneyWe are proud to say, we were the first to design & make an external storage solution specifically for smartphones: we introduced the Mini MicroSD Card Reader for Android 3 years ago on kickstarter. Since then, we were asked this question a lot: are you going to introduce something similar for iPhone/iPad? Eventually we got around to work on it, and here it is.We started working on Dash-i at the same time as we started working on the third-generation of our Mini MicroSD reader with USB 3.1 Type-C plug. We did a successful kickstarter campaign late last year and launched  Dash Reader Type-C in February. Dash-i shares the same outer casing with Dash Type-C and thus has the same form-factor except for different connectors. However, Dash-i involves a lot more work since Apple added its proprietary layer to USB storage access, and we need to develop a companion App to work with it.Here is an inside look of the PCBA's for Dash Type-C and Dash-i with Lightning connector: while Dash Type-C uses just a single USB storage IC chip, Dash-i requires 3 IC chips.PCBA: Dash-i prototype vs. Dash Type-C pre-productionCurrent Status. CAD & board designs for both Dash-i & Dash-i Plus have been done. Our Dash-i design has been approved by Apple and product sample has been lab-tested and approved by Apple as well. We are in the process of getting Dash-i Plus tested and approved by Apple. After that, we will start working on tooling. Companion App development is an ongoing process: all basic features have been done, some more advanced features are still under development (e.g., auto photo backup, built-in full-featured music player).RewardsTwo variants of Dash-i will be available: Dash-i (smaller without concurrent charging), Dash-i Plus (larger, with concurrent charging); each has 3 colors to choose from: silver, gray, gold -- matching the 3 colors for iPhone/iPad. Included with each unit, there is a silicone protective case that can be attached to a keyring or carabiner. You will be able to select the color for each unit that you pledge for in a survey you will receive after this campaign concludes and before your reward is shipped.Dash-i and Dash-i Plus are for iPhone/iPad/iPod Touch devices with Lightning port ONLY. They are NOT compatible with Apple devices with older 30-pin ports, and they are NOT compatible with iPod Nano (even though it may have the Lightning port).List of all compatible iOS devices: iPhone 6/6s/6 Plus/6s Plus, iPhone SE, iPhone 5/5s/5c, iPad Pro (12.9"" & 9.7""), iPad Air & Air 2, iPad 4, iPad Mini (all versions: 1, 2, 3, 4), iPod Touch 5th Gen & 6th Gen.  Risks & Challenges  
Delay is always a possibility. As a responsible project creator, we only launch a campaign after we have the done the design, prototype and testing of prototypes. Delivery date estimate is based on the time required to finish the remaining work: tooling, pilot production run, production. We often factor-in some time for some possible delay causes. However, there may be something that we fail to foresee or we fail to estimate accurately the required time and they lead to delay in project completion. Such factors include vendor delay in finishing tooling, component sourcing, Apple's testing & approval process. While the major functionalities of the companion App is done, some features are still under development. Software project often takes longer than planned. It is possible that some planned features may not be available in the App at the time when Dash-i is launched (but will eventually be).We have successfully completed several kickstarter projects prior to this, we are confident that we will do it again this time. And we will make better ones this time around as we have accumulated quite a bit of experience. Thus the chance of outright failure is remote. We also have accumulated quite a bit of experience in quality control, we are confident that we will do better than ever on this.",17.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: 30px; letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;"">WHAT IS BAGGIO?</span></p>
<div>
<p>Have you ever thought you were in possession of something critical to your daily life — a report due to a client, a clean diaper for an infant, a tire iron for changing a spare — only to discover at the last and absolutely wrong moment that what you need most is not where you thought it was — your briefcase, diaper bag or car trunk? How do you feel at that moment? Frustrated, embarrassed, scared, helpless, angry? Probably all of the above.</p>
<p>As professionals, parents of three children, and people generally trying to stay ahead of our crazy-busy, on-the-go lives, we have found ourselves unprepared for problems that can arise — like needing baby supplies — at the most inopportune times. Such moments can ruin your day. Who needs that?</p>
<p>So we founded Baggio in June 2014 to develop sensor technology, integrated with stylish and affordable diaper bags and other accessories, to ensure that people like us have what we need, when we need it, to avoid unnecessary stressful situations. Baggio’s smart bag technology provides a stylish, secure, and convenient solution to the very real problem of keeping busy people prepared while on the go. </p>

<b>
</b><p></p>
<p style=""display: inline !important;""></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p></p>
<b></b><p style=""display: inline !important;"">The Baggio Smart Bag is a patent pending integrated system monitors the capacity, existence and status of contents within the smart bag and wirelessly transmits this status to a modern smart phone (Android/iOS(coming soon)) application. In addition to status, quantity reminders and bag inventory, the system also tracks the current and last location to either remind or find the bag should it be forgotten or lost. This functionality is intended to notify users that they are leaving a location (your house for example) and forgetting to take the bag, or leaving a remote location and forgetting the bag thereby notifying the user it is out of range and reporting the last known location.</p>
<p></p>
<p style=""display: inline !important;""></p>
<p>Okay so that means it is a really cool bag that will let you know if you are forgetting something.  It alerts you as to the status of what you have in the pockets of the bag.  Is it full? Empty? Or somewhere in between?  Baggio will let you know!</p>
<p>Baggio also tracks the current and last location to either remind of the bag's location or find the bag should it be forgotten or lost. This functionality is intended to let you know if you are leaving a location (your house for example) and forgetting to take the bag, or leaving a remote location and forgetting the bag.</p>Baggio alerts users of missing and low quantity items via its intuitive smart phone application.  The Baggio app provides alerts of the status of each interior pocket and will ""beep"" if the embedded sensors senses that either of the pockets are low or empty.  Once more, the patent pending system is designed to provide timely information regarding the status of the Bagg's interior pockets.  In other words, Baggio will alert you that your missing your stuff before you leave your home - without the stress and headache of having to figure out how and where to get these crucial items.  No more being out an event with your baby, reaching in your diaper bag only to discover that there are no diapers!<br/>

Have you ever thought you were in possession of something critical to your daily life — a report due to a client, a clean diaper for an infant, a tire iron for changing a spare — only to discover at the last and absolutely wrong moment that what you need most is not where you thought it was — your briefcase, diaper bag or car trunk? How do you feel at that moment? Frustrated, embarrassed, scared, helpless, angry? Probably all of the above.
As professionals, parents of three children, and people generally trying to stay ahead of our crazy-busy, on-the-go lives, we have found ourselves unprepared for problems that can arise — like needing baby supplies — at the most inopportune times. Such moments can ruin your day. Who needs that?
So we founded Baggio in June 2014 to develop sensor technology, integrated with stylish and affordable diaper bags and other accessories, to ensure that people like us have what we need, when we need it, to avoid unnecessary stressful situations. Baggio’s smart bag technology provides a stylish, secure, and convenient solution to the very real problem of keeping busy people prepared while on the go. 





HOW BAGGIO WORKS





The Baggio Smart Bag is a patent pending integrated system monitors the capacity, existence and status of contents within the smart bag and wirelessly transmits this status to a modern smart phone (Android/iOS(coming soon)) application. In addition to status, quantity reminders and bag inventory, the system also tracks the current and last location to either remind or find the bag should it be forgotten or lost. This functionality is intended to notify users that they are leaving a location (your house for example) and forgetting to take the bag, or leaving a remote location and forgetting the bag thereby notifying the user it is out of range and reporting the last known location.


Okay so that means it is a really cool bag that will let you know if you are forgetting something.  It alerts you as to the status of what you have in the pockets of the bag.  Is it full? Empty? Or somewhere in between?  Baggio will let you know!
Baggio also tracks the current and last location to either remind of the bag's location or find the bag should it be forgotten or lost. This functionality is intended to let you know if you are leaving a location (your house for example) and forgetting to take the bag, or leaving a remote location and forgetting the bag.Baggio alerts users of missing and low quantity items via its intuitive smart phone application.  The Baggio app provides alerts of the status of each interior pocket and will ""beep"" if the embedded sensors senses that either of the pockets are low or empty.  Once more, the patent pending system is designed to provide timely information regarding the status of the Bagg's interior pockets.  In other words, Baggio will alert you that your missing your stuff before you leave your home - without the stress and headache of having to figure out how and where to get these crucial items.  No more being out an event with your baby, reaching in your diaper bag only to discover that there are no diapers!








Moms, Dads and Caregivers everywhere can feel the peace of mind knowing that they have everything they need to take care of their kids!  Gone is the day that you reach into the diaper but there are no wipes, or diapers, or extra clothes, or medicine, or bottles, or any of the other things you need to take care of your baby /toddler.  Baggio has four compartments that we use for diapers, wipes, bottles and extra clothes.  You  set the bag to remind you of whatever you need.  As your needs change so can your Baggio reminders.  You set the pockets and you can calibrate the pockets to different 'full' levels.  For example, if you have a newborn baby the diapers are considerably smaller than for a potty training toddler.  With a simple click Baggio now knows the new full.  


Cool Factors

Baggio alerts you if you have forgotten your phone too!  The phone app tells you if you have forgotten the bag AND the Baggio Bag tells you if you have forgotten your phone!
You can charge your phone and other devices in the Baggio bag.
Wireless charging (coming soon) ... Busy day at work?  Just drop your Bagg on the charging port.
Stylish ... The Bagg can be used for multiple purposes - It converts to either a messenger bag or backpack for your carrying convenience.
Baggio comes in grey or black. New colors are on the way.


How You Can Help Your contributions will fund the further development of the bag.  You will help us bring this super useful bag to life!  Plus you get some really cool swag!

name is <b>Soriba Bangoura</b>, and I am an entrepreneur in Silicon Valley.
Originally born in Guinea, I have lived in the U.S. for eleven years,
and have spent much of my life trying to give back to those around
me. My name <b>Soriba </b>means ‘good doer’ or ‘very generous person’,
and it is my wish to live my life as my name suggests. My most recent

<p>For
many persons in the African continent, especially those who need to
connect with others, this can be a very difficult endeavor. The cost
of advertising in a paper or otherwise is much too expensive to be
practical, and so simple announcements that anyone else could pay a
few dollars to post can seem almost impossible. With soriba.org
however, this problem will be a thing of the past. This website will
be a forever free-to-use classifieds website that anyone will be able
to post on and access anywhere, allowing Africans a free space on the
web where they could go to announce professional services, find
housing and jobs, ask questions, sell, buy, and almost anything else
they choose.</p>
<p>More
than a website, soriba.org is a community, and one which I am
actively helping to build. Over the past two years, I've collectively
helped other persons to post almost 90,000 ads at soriba.org, and
have never charged my users for a single one. Now I’d like to
expand the service reach of the website, and this is the reason this
campaign was established. With your help, I will be able to improve
the African community, showcase their talents, and allow them the
chance to express themselves like never before.</p>
<p>Soriba.org
is looking to raise $250,000 in startup capital in order to establish
coffee shops in several locations, where users will not only have
access to the internet, thereby allowing them to make their own
postings on soriba.org, but be connected to the world at large. The
coffee shops will also be doing something much more integral to
everyday life, and that is providing coffee and breakfast to patrons
who need it. 
</p>
<p>Every
dollar we raise goes not only towards this goal, but to the payment
of our development team who works hard to maintain the website, and
those who will be working in the coffee shops as well. To everyone
who donates, you have our eternal gratitude. Soriba.org was
established to make these kinds of impact on the community, and with
your help, we will be able to do all this and so much more.</p>
<p>But
soriba.org won’t be stopping there. If you visit our website, you
will see that we are actively spreading our reach into the global
community. With soriba.org, you will soon be able to show your own
listings not only to your country, but to the world at large, as our
user base will grow to incorporate persons from every town, city,
country and continent the world over. You will be able to connect
with persons like never before.</p>
<p>Soriba
is divided into forums that allow you to post based on what services
you would like to get and offer, and this will make it easier for you
to find your target audience. Persons looking for a home will be able
to scan that category in order to find something to suit their needs,
and so will spend less time browsing and more time getting a hold of

In The Media
CusbyTM has been featured in all of the following publications.

Unlimited Connectivity
Sync to any number of USB-C, HDMI and standard USB portsusing a single USB-C port.



Unique and Unprecedented
Seamlessly extend the functionality of USB-C technology.



CusbyTM provides new MacBook users the ability to charge their laptop and connect all of their devices simultaneously with a single USB-C port, without requiring a bulky and expensive USB hub or docking station.

Our Vision
A port for all occasions.

Big Things Have Small Beginnings
We've lined up 3 models at launch: Power charger, USB-A and HDMI. Other ports in the pipeline are Thunderbolt, Display Port and Ethernet, with more in development. With USB-C set to become the new standard, CusbyTM is future proof since more variations can be designed as new technologies are developed. 


How Does It Work?
It starts by connecting a Cusby unit to any USB-C port. This can be done by either plugging it directly into the laptop's USB-C port, or by using an optional extension cable to add more flexibility.
From there, multiple Cusbys can be linked together like lego blocks to create their own combination of ports for any situation. Every time a new Cusby is added, a new USB-C port is created, so there is always a free port available.


With Modular Expansion, The Possibilities Are Endless.
CusbyTM's modular design means you always have the exact ports you need, so you never have to commit to a set of ports you may not use. Users can interchange, combine and expand their sets of CusbyTM as needed.

CusbyTM Is Lightweight And Compact, So It Is Easy To Transport While On-The-Go.
The new MacBook was designed with portability in mind. Before CusbyTM, connecting multiple devices to the MacBook's lone USB-C port meant having to carry a cumbersome multi-port docking station with you wherever you went. With CusbyTM, you can achieve the same functionality without taking up a lot of extra space.

Universal USB-C Compatibility Ensures You Always Stay Connected
If history has taught us anything, the MacBook is just the first of many soon to be released slim, ultra-portable laptops.

CusbyTM works with any USB-C port, making it a long-term solution that will last for years to come.

2015 Timeline
Here's what's in store for CusbyTM this year.


The CusbyTM Story
A practical solution to an impractical problem.






The Problem
When Apple first unveiled the new 12-inch MacBook in March 2015, they made a bold decision to only include a single USB-C port.










""The MacBook’s real annoyances begin with that single USB Type-C port... living with just one port — especially one that doesn’t work with much yet — is painful."" - Wall Street Journal









Apple believes that wireless connectivity is the future. However, the large majority of consumers still rely on cables to connect, sync and charge their devices.







""At some point, getting data and electricity to and from your MacBook with just one port may be seamless and natural. Today, though, we’re at least a few dongles away."" - Wired Magazine








This single port has now become the only way to establish a physical connection between the MacBook and any other device or power source, making it nearly impossible to connect multiple devices at the same time.









""The lack of ports hasn't gone down too well with potential buyers, who are mourning the lack of standard USB ports and HDMI and DisplayPort connectors."" - The Inquirer









By limiting the new MacBook to a single USB port, users are forced to buy expensive ""name brand"" adapters to sync multiple devices directly to their laptops.



UNTIL NOW.

a mobile phone, a mobile phone is useless without battery and power charge. I
found that millions of people across the globe spend substantial amount of time
charging their phones, while being confined at a particular place. While a
wired charger contradicts the whole idea of mobile phones, a wireless charger
would provide new dimensions to the mobile industry. In other words, life would
be much simpler with power on the go! This idea intrigued me the most.</span><br/></p>

mobile charger being a smart one, which would tell about the mobile’s location,

be on a run all the time and our beloved mobiles would find a safe haven in our
pockets, even after being stolen.""</p>

Why I Have Invented This ? 
""Whenever I tried to imagine life in 21st
century without a mobile phone, I couldn’t. While life is unimaginable without
a mobile phone, a mobile phone is useless without battery and power charge. I
found that millions of people across the globe spend substantial amount of time
charging their phones, while being confined at a particular place. While a
wired charger contradicts the whole idea of mobile phones, a wireless charger
would provide new dimensions to the mobile industry. In other words, life would
be much simpler with power on the go! This idea intrigued me the most.


I also thought that life would be so
much if mobile phones turned to be “theft proof”. I imagined the odds of a
mobile charger being a smart one, which would tell about the mobile’s location,
in case it is stolen while being charged. My idea was that mobile thieves would
be on a run all the time and our beloved mobiles would find a safe haven in our
pockets, even after being stolen.""

<h3>PikaPage app </h3>
<p><strong>Publish Mobile-Friendly pages with tables and lists</strong></p>
<p>PikaPage is a mobile app that lets non-tech people build and publish mobile-friendly tables and lists. My team has completed a demo version (iOS only) with core functions, which demonstrated our capability. (Watch video of the demo version at ""Where we are"" section below.)</p>
<h3>Applications</h3>
<ul>
<li>Group tour itinerary</li>
<li>Sports tournament schedule and results</li>
<li>Child activities timetable to share with husband, granny and nanny</li>
<li>Wedding and other event timetable, class timetables</li>
<li>Small business simple webpage (sandwich shop daily menu, take-away pizza menu)</li>
<li><strong><i>Any activities that need timetables or lists to share with a group</i></strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>PikaTable: Mobile-friendly tables</h3>

<ul></ul>
<h3>Where we are</h3>
<p>We already have a demo version that is working with the core functions, and can create pages that can be view on the app or on a phone browser. This video below shows the key functons that has already been built into the demo version:</p>
<div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ByrMyXpkJTY?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div><i>video showing demo version</i></div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<p>We are already working on the second phase of the project, to build an free version. Target to be publicly downloadable in mid December.</p>
<p>So far this project has been entirely funded by myself. In this campaign, I wish to not only raise some money for the next phrase of development, but also to obtain opinion and ideas from people like you who support my vision. I call this ""Crowdfounding"".  A combination of crowdfunding and crowdsourcing. See more below.</p>
<h3>Why I am doing this</h3>
<p>I have worked 25 years in corporate jobs in Hong Kong, London, Tokyo and Shanghai. I enjoyed most of it.</p>
<p>I care a lot about mobile user experience. And I have been keeping up with the latest technology since the most primitive smartphone came out - in order that I could work anywhere, not to be bound by the desk and the computer.</p>
<p>I remember doing a global sales conference call in my swimsuit by the swimming pool, with my headset and my iPad, waiting to jump into water polo practise as soon as the call is over.</p>
<p>But with all the new technology like Cloud and Virtual Reality, people still have no choice but to use Excel to create a timetable. And I really hate scrolling left and right on my phone.</p>
<p>As I quit my last corporate job a couple years ago as the Head of China for a  Fortune 500 company, I thought I got to do something different. I want to make a difference to the world, however slight.</p>
<p>Hence the PikaPage project. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div>
<p>I would be really grateful for your support, not only for the cash, but also the feeling that someone out there also think this small thing is important.</p>
<p>The cash I raised will be used to build the premium version. I hope to raise enough with this campaign, but if not, I will find other ways.  </p>
<p>I have designed 3 levels of perks.  The first one is the simplest, just pre-order the premium version at a discount.  I am thinking $10 per year for premium subscription. What do you think? </p>
<p>The second level allows you to also test drive beta versions.</p>
<p>The third level gets you into the exclusive club.  I will share details of the project, and I really hope to hear your opinion, whether you are an IT or a marketing expert.</p>
<p>In any case, I hope you feel as excited as I am, for being a part of this meaningful project.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Here comes the vision part.  My main vision is that PikaPage will make our daily phone use a better experience.  </p>
<p>Timetables are anchors for many activities. Mobile-friendly timetables can greatly improve user experience. <a href=""https://pikapageblog.blogspot.hk/2016/10/no-more-scrolling-around.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">No more scrolling around - better mobile experience</a></p>
<p>Organizers can easily edit data in reaction to last-minute circumstances, especially useful for emergency response, as in this example below, an upcoming tropical cyclonecompletely disrupted the plan for an outdoor event. <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/leroy.yue/posts/10154771437136337?pnref=story"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Emergency Response - how PikaPage got everyone on the same page</a></p>

Annoying, right?
PikaPage app 
Publish Mobile-Friendly pages with tables and lists
PikaPage is a mobile app that lets non-tech people build and publish mobile-friendly tables and lists. My team has completed a demo version (iOS only) with core functions, which demonstrated our capability. (Watch video of the demo version at ""Where we are"" section below.)
Applications

Group tour itinerary
Sports tournament schedule and results
Child activities timetable to share with husband, granny and nanny
Wedding and other event timetable, class timetables
Small business simple webpage (sandwich shop daily menu, take-away pizza menu)
Any activities that need timetables or lists to share with a group

PikaTable: Mobile-friendly tables
Important data at a glance, click a row to see more

(screenshot from actual product)
Click here to see a page generated by the app (demo version).
It is amazing how regular people have no easy way to create a simple timetable like the one above, after all these years of smartphones.
 
Product to Market Fit
Prototype pages were build for several uses. Click to see (mobile only)
2016 Panasonic Asia Pacific Water Polo Tournament
2015 HKBWP Singapore Tour
Sophie's Calendar (name changed to protect identity)
(These pages don't look as good as pages generated by the app. These are ""concierge MVP"" pages to test and study acceptance and user reactions.)
 
Some user feedback
From a mom with a 5-year old:


Water polo tournament organizer:

From a yoga teacher:


Where we are
We already have a demo version that is working with the core functions, and can create pages that can be view on the app or on a phone browser. This video below shows the key functons that has already been built into the demo version:


video showing demo version
 

We are already working on the second phase of the project, to build an free version. Target to be publicly downloadable in mid December.
So far this project has been entirely funded by myself. In this campaign, I wish to not only raise some money for the next phrase of development, but also to obtain opinion and ideas from people like you who support my vision. I call this ""Crowdfounding"".  A combination of crowdfunding and crowdsourcing. See more below.
Why I am doing this
I have worked 25 years in corporate jobs in Hong Kong, London, Tokyo and Shanghai. I enjoyed most of it.
I care a lot about mobile user experience. And I have been keeping up with the latest technology since the most primitive smartphone came out - in order that I could work anywhere, not to be bound by the desk and the computer.
I remember doing a global sales conference call in my swimsuit by the swimming pool, with my headset and my iPad, waiting to jump into water polo practise as soon as the call is over.
But with all the new technology like Cloud and Virtual Reality, people still have no choice but to use Excel to create a timetable. And I really hate scrolling left and right on my phone.
As I quit my last corporate job a couple years ago as the Head of China for a  Fortune 500 company, I thought I got to do something different. I want to make a difference to the world, however slight.
Hence the PikaPage project. 
What We Need & What You Get

I would be really grateful for your support, not only for the cash, but also the feeling that someone out there also think this small thing is important.
The cash I raised will be used to build the premium version. I hope to raise enough with this campaign, but if not, I will find other ways.  
I have designed 3 levels of perks.  The first one is the simplest, just pre-order the premium version at a discount.  I am thinking $10 per year for premium subscription. What do you think? 
The second level allows you to also test drive beta versions.
The third level gets you into the exclusive club.  I will share details of the project, and I really hope to hear your opinion, whether you are an IT or a marketing expert.
In any case, I hope you feel as excited as I am, for being a part of this meaningful project.
The Impact

Here comes the vision part.  My main vision is that PikaPage will make our daily phone use a better experience.  
Timetables are anchors for many activities. Mobile-friendly timetables can greatly improve user experience. No more scrolling around - better mobile experience
Organizers can easily edit data in reaction to last-minute circumstances, especially useful for emergency response, as in this example below, an upcoming tropical cyclonecompletely disrupted the plan for an outdoor event. Emergency Response - how PikaPage got everyone on the same page
After 50 years of internet, most small businesses still don't have internet presence. Sometimes, a simple page is what they need. Mobile Webpage to the people
 
Risks & Challenges

When I first told this idea to a good friend, (CFO of a large listed company), he said,
""What's wrong with zooming and scrolling around the phone screen? This has been the way things are. Why would you want to waste time trying to change things? Startups are for young kids. You are too old!""
I agree that startups are risky. But I cannot accept that I am too old to do this.
Many people may like the convenience or beauty from something like PikaPage, but they simply will not put in the slightest effort to change their habit.
I think the biggest uncertainty is, after the early adopters, how hard will it be to get the early majority to change their current habit.
The good thing about PikaPage is, once a page is created, it is shared to multiple people. If one or more of the recipients likes it, and create a page himself, the app becomes viral.
There are billions of people in the world. 
I am committed to find out how many people care.
Other Ways You Can Help

If you can chip in a few dollars to help, I will be really grateful.  But I also understand that sometimes it is a pain to make a small payment on the internet. If that is the case, please share this campaign to show your support.
Thank you so much!

<p>My name is Larry B. Carswell. I invented a new cable free winch for ATVS (All Terrain Vehicles). This product will revolutionize and positively change the ATV industry. My product is called “Mudder”.</p>
<p>Mudder is a very unique and one-of-a-kind winch designed to make cable winches obsolete.  Cables are currently being used on winches to pull out an ATV that is stuck in mud. The cable has to be wrapped around a tree or a fixed object to pull the ATV out of the stuck position.</p>
<p>My unique patent pending product, Mudder, is a self-contained chain driven paddle winch that has been proven to be an effective, efficient way to keep an ATV moving forward without getting stuck. Mudder has been over 2 years in development and has undergone over 12 months of rigorous testing in extreme conditions.  I am seeking funding to complete the development process including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Manufacturing and machine costs</li>
<li>Product improvements</li>
<li>Additional testing</li>
</ul>
<p>I introduced Mudder at the 2016 INPEX-InventHelp International Trade Show in Pittsburg, Pa. This is the largest new inventors trade show in the United States with over 1,000 participants from all over the world.</p>
<p>Mudder was awarded the distinction of being the INPEX-InventHelp 2016 International Trade Show’s Invention of the Year as well as:</p>
<ul>
<li>The International Grand Prix Award</li>
<li>1st place Gold Medal in Engineering</li>
<li>1st place Gold Medal in Design</li>
<li>1st place Gold Medal in Specialized Technology</li>
<li>1st place Gold Medal in Recreation</li>
</ul>
<p>Mudder is a one-of-a-kind product that was invented to replace the cable winch system that is currently being used. There is not another winch in the world like Mudder. While conducting our patent search we did not find any competitors, competing products or pending products similar to Mudder.</p>
<p>ATVs (All Terrain Vehicles) are made mainly for off-road fun or work. The biggest problem is that the vehicles will often get stuck in extreme muddy conditions. Currently most ATVs are equipped with a cable winch mounted to the front of the vehicle. The cable winch system is designed so that the vehicle operator must find a tree or a fixed object or another ATV that is within the reach and length of the cable that is mounted to the stuck vehicle. The operator has to dismount the vehicle, pull the cable from the winch by hand, tie or attach the cable around a tree, a fixed object or another ATV. At this point the operator will engage the electric winch to help pull the vehicle out of the mud. Often the vehicle will get stuck in the middle of a sea of mud where there are no trees, fixed objects or ATVs in sight. Attaching the cable to another ATV can create another problem which is, that ATV can also get stuck.</p>
<p>Mudder is a chain driven, self-contained winching system. Mudder has the potential to make the cable driven winching system obsolete. This unique design is cable free and has the power to pull the ATV out of mud without needing to be attached to a tree or a fixed object.

<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The Sunthetic Solar Case is created of Apple certified parts, the best solar panel on the market and a slim battery of that can recharge your iPhone with at least 40% of additional power. These elements are situated in a case meticulously designed by our Co-Founder Nikola Knezevic.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Slide your iPhone into our case, lock down the cap of the case, and forget about missing energy for your iPhone ever again. Wherever you are, whenever during the day (as long is there is sunlight), <strong>the solar panel is charging the battery inside</strong> your Sunthetic Solar Case. By <strong>turning your case</strong>, the sensor in your solar panel is activated. If you <strong>double-tap the surface</strong> of the solar panel, the battery inside the case will release energy sufficient <strong>to boost your iPhone’s power level by 10%</strong>. The battery inside the case, when fully charged, allows for you to take this action 3 more times, making it possible to charge your iPhone’s battery level by 40%. It is easy as 1-2-3:</p>
<ul>
<li>Turn your iphone</li>
<li>Double-tap the solar panel</li>
<li>Recharge!</li>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">The use of renewable energy has been greatly mystified, seeming unattainable at times and like magic at others, but the reality is quite different. Renewables, such as solar, are not only our way out of an environmental disaster, but can significantly affect and improve our daily lives and routines.

Therefore, by triple tapping of the solar panel, you will be able to boost your iPhone’s energy level by 40% of additional energy.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">At €150.000, we will be able to incorporate <strong>a more powerful and thin battery inside the case</strong>, without compromising the design. This battery would allow for at least 80% of additional charge for your iPhone!</p>

<h3>FAQ </h3>
<h4>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;"">What type of cellular network can Wavve support? </span><br/>
</h4>

<p><br/></p>
<h4>How long does it take to charge Wavve with sunlight? </h4>
<p>From our experiment, it takes around six hours to fully charge Wavve from a low power state via direct sunlight. However, due to the varying strength of sunlight in different circumstances the actual time to fully charge the battery can differ.</p>

<h4>Which are the phones compatible with Wavve’s wireless charging? </h4>
<p>Wavve can wirelessly charge many brands of mobile phones. Most newer models do not need anything extra to work with Wavve. For older phone models, we offer a very thin, paper-like simple NFC attachment can be used for wireless charging with Wavve.</p>

That's really no clumsy wires required!For frequent travellers - Wavve becomes a wireless hotspot the moment you insert a SIM card with a data plan. You can be sure of good local connectivity wherever you are and connect up with several of your personal devices via this hotspot.Taxi, food, shopping, hotel, flights... everything at your fingertips with just Wavve. Isn't it fantastic with no power or connection downtime?Why did I want to create Wavve? 


Hate Switching SIM Cards in-out of Phone. Don't want to carry another phone or just buy a phone with dual-SIM slots.
Finding WiFi Hotspots. Hate the signing in and out of free wireless hotspots or pay $$ for just a short time of Internet access. Talk about security concerns!
Out of Power and Finding Charging Stations - hate looking out for charging stations not to mentioned the right charging ports (lightning or microUSB)



How Does it Work?

Charging Wavve

Very simple. Put the side of Wavve with the solar panels facing sunlight. Wavve can also be charged using the common cable (microUSB) via a power source.



Charging your mobile phone
Turn the side of Wavve with the NFC charging pattern facing up. Put your phone on Wavve and see your phone charging.



Setting up WiFi
Open the top cover portion of Wavve and insert your 3G/4G SIM card. Close the cover and wait for the data connection light to show GREEN. You will see the wireless hotspot by the name of ""Wavve"".

<h1>FAQ</h1>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">1. What is CLIKI?</b><br/></p>
<p>CLIKI is a wireless smart button that provides a shortcut to the most popular features you use on your smartphone, such as your camera, music or launching GPS for directions.</p>
<p><b>2. How is cLIKI different from other smart buttons?</b></p>
<p>Smart buttons are awesome, but they can sometimes be difficult to program and confusing to use.  Many use stickers or clips to secure them and are usually not available when you need it.  CLIKI includes a very simple to use App to select the function and control the features to use with the button. The features and button functions are pre-programmed so it is simple to set-up and use.  CLIKI is very compact and stylish and is available with a sleek and attractive protective case to store the button so it is always available when you need it.  </p>
<p><b>3. How do I use CLIKI?</b></p>
<p>CLIKI connects wirelessly to your IOS or Android device via Bluetooth and includes an easy to use mobile App that you download from the App store or Google Play. Once you decide what function you want to operate with your CLIKI button, just select it in the App.   Now whenever you press CLIKI it will control the selected feature.  As these features are already pre-programmed to the button, there is no need for any additional programming.  Using CLIKI is intuitive.  There are basically three actions available <b>Click</b>, <b>Double</b> <b>Click</b> and <b>Long Press.  </b>The instructions on how to control each feature is shown in the instruction bar at the bottom of the screen when the feature is selected in case you forget. </p>
<p><b>4. How do I prevent CLIKI from being accidentally activated?</b></p>
<p>CLIKI is pre-programmed with a button lock/unlock feature to prevent accidental activation if needed.  Simply click the button 3 times to lock the button.  Another 3 clicks unlocks the button.  CLIKI also has a auto-lock feature that that you can activate to lock the button automatically if it is not used for a while.  You can change the lock delay time from the settings menu.</p>
<p><b>5. Will CLIKI work with all Android and Apple devices?</b></p>
<p>No.  CLIKI requires the device to be Bluetooth 4.0 (BLE) capable and for Android devices to be running Android 4.4 (KitKat) or later and Apple devices to be running iOS 7 or later firmware.</p>
<p><b>5. Can the battery in CLIK<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">I be replaced?</span></b></p>
<p style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Arial, sans-serif; color: rgb(42, 42, 42); letter-spacing: normal; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">Yes.  Simply remove the back cover and replace the CR2032 battery.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>6. How long will the battery last?</b></p>
<p>The battery life will typically last up to two years so you won't have to change it very often.<br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>7. Can I use CLIKI outdoors?</b></span><br/></p>
<p>Yes,  CLIKI uses nano-coating technology to protect the electronics from moisture so it is water resistant and can be used outdoors.</p>
<p><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">8. How do I choose the colors? </b><br/></p>
<p>Once funded, we will send you a form to fill out where you will be able to select from the available colors and let us know where you want us to ship your CLIKI.  </p>
<p><b>9. Will I be able to use multiple features on my phone at the same time?</b></p>
<p>Yes.  The button will only control the feature you select but you will be able to use other features as normal on your phone.  For example, you can listen to music and have the button set to SOS mode but you would not be able to control the music with the button unless you select Music mode in the App.  </p>

CLIKI is pre-programmed with a button lock/unlock feature to prevent accidental activation if needed.  Simply click the button 3 times to lock the button.  Another 3 clicks unlocks the button.  CLIKI also has a auto-lock feature that that you can activate to lock the button automatically if it is not used for a while.  You can change the lock delay time from the settings menu.
5. Will CLIKI work with all Android and Apple devices?
No.  CLIKI requires the device to be Bluetooth 4.0 (BLE) capable and for Android devices to be running Android 4.4 (KitKat) or later and Apple devices to be running iOS 7 or later firmware.
5. Can the battery in CLIKI be replaced?
Yes.  Simply remove the back cover and replace the CR2032 battery.  

6. How long will the battery last?
The battery life will typically last up to two years so you won't have to change it very often.
7. Can I use CLIKI outdoors?
Yes,  CLIKI uses nano-coating technology to protect the electronics from moisture so it is water resistant and can be used outdoors.
8. How do I choose the colors? 
Once funded, we will send you a form to fill out where you will be able to select from the available colors and let us know where you want us to ship your CLIKI.  
9. Will I be able to use multiple features on my phone at the same time?
Yes.  The button will only control the feature you select but you will be able to use other features as normal on your phone.  For example, you can listen to music and have the button set to SOS mode but you would not be able to control the music with the button unless you select Music mode in the App.",43.0,1,"3 Campaigns

<p>We have selected GoSolar parts scrupulously, therefore GoSolar charger consists of the best parts what can be fond in market. We have to relay on part manufacturers. We have verified all our suppliers for no part delays. Assembly will be made by us that allow doing quality check at each assembly stage. </p>
<p>GoSolar case will be made using injection molding which means they might have different tolerances. Certification could make some electric scheme element position changes but we have deal it without any problems previously to pass necessary tests. To make sure we ship out the best product we can, we might make the required adjustments.</p>
<p>Whatever challenges we meet, we will keep you updated. Our main target is to ship the best product in time.</p>

On the other hand, cleaning a tempered glass is a very long and time-consuming process. All that means  nano screen protector have strong ability about crack-proof, explosion-proof, Anti-fingerprints. The most important thing is that you don’t worry the broken screen protector will hurt you and your children or your pets.</p><p><strong>WHY DO YOU NEED A SCREEN GUARD</strong><br/><br/>Today there are still many people insist on their devices like smartphone, PDAs used without screen guards. They believe that screen guard will keep away from good touch feeling of original.</p><p>But with prep development of science and technology, many screen guards not only can protect screen well, but not effect anything of the devices, including the touch feeling. Some people especially some families with children, people ardently love outdoor sports need a excellent smartphone screen guard to bear a accident.</p><p>The purpose of a screen guard is to provide additional durability to the screen of an electronic device. PDAs and smartphone devices helped the development of screen guards. The initial design was done in the year 1968 by Herbert Schlegel and the protector was meant for TVs. They were vulnerable but acted as a first line of defense, ever since. Screen guard have evolved from fragile entities to the most strongest as in the case of a nano screen protector. However, opinion is still devided among many people about the use of a screen protector- whether it is useful or not! There are many advantages of having a screen protector, which are explained below and emphasized the fact that screen protectors are very important.</p><p><strong>1. Protection &amp; endurance </strong>– As the name suggests, screen guard offers great protection to the device from damages. A plastic screen can help original screen to avoid scratches, a tempered glass can of some resistance during damages and nano protector screen can withstand heavy damages due to higher endurance surface. Based on the type the protection levels of the screen increases and they will certainly help the devices to last long.</p><p><strong>2.Fingerprint Resistance</strong>– A smartphone or any electric device will wear out by constant use and the effect is doubled when it comes to touch screens. We can find fingerprints and smudges that spoil the appearance of the display. A screen guard can be replaced if the fingerprints become too many, but a device cannot be, Therefore, they occupy a great place is saving the display of the device.</p><p><strong>3. Aestheticism</strong>– Although, screen guards themselves cannot provide any beauty to the electronic device they can certainly shield the glory of a device. All the scratches, smudges, stains, fingerprints, dirt.etc. can be barred by protectors and help to maintain the look. It is needless to say that aestheticism plays a big role while trying to re-sell a gadget. Further, a matte screen guards can gives grand look to the device with the finish it offers improving the chances of getting a great deal from the customer.</p><p><strong>4.  Anti-glare</strong>- Most screen guards come with matte finish that helps in diffusing the light that falls on the screen (which creates an uncomfortable reflection of the display). Without the screen, viewers feel it is very hard to look at the display for longer periods of time. People who use mobiles under the sun, outdoors or under bright light can reduce their eye tension with the help of screen guards. Some screen guards can help to reflect the UV light from entering the device, this help to maintain the life of the gadget for longer periods.</p><p><strong>5. Saving Money</strong>– If the display of a smartphone is damaged. It takes a fortune to replace it if the insurance doesn’t cover the cause. It costs less to replace the display of a low-end gadget. But what happens if an iPhone or an Samsung is damaged? The individual can buy a mid-end phone instead of repairing the display; such is the cost of replacement for these mobiles. A gorilla glass protector or a nano screen guard can protect the display to an extent that mediocre damages cannot even get to the display. As a result, one can save a lot money and can have an assurance that their device will be alright. Of course there is that little cash you will have to part with buying them but it is what they shield from breakage that brings about the cost-effective benefit.</p><p><strong>6.Special features</strong> – There are some screen guards that have unique features that add extra features to the roster. UV damaging to reflect UV light, privacy screen to avoid others to look into the screen, anti-bacterial properties for controlling the formation of bacteria. Etc. are few of special features that are really wonderful. However, one have to spend extra amout of money to get a screen guard with these features. After reading the benefits of screen guards, one can realize that they are more than just a thin film on the screen. They offer great advantages and the importance of having a protector should never be ignored. It would be a tough challenge to choose the right one, but one should understand the need of the electric device and select the one that can compliment.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478246697/w8vy8kdbdd6k35g3i5hz.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p><p>   </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478247049/qiyagxd3dqcbvc5e5owi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3><p>We have been doing our due diligence on this product for over three months from prototyping to testing.

Of course there is that little cash you will have to part with buying them but it is what they shield from breakage that brings about the cost-effective benefit.6.Special features – There are some screen guards that have unique features that add extra features to the roster. UV damaging to reflect UV light, privacy screen to avoid others to look into the screen, anti-bacterial properties for controlling the formation of bacteria. Etc. are few of special features that are really wonderful. However, one have to spend extra amout of money to get a screen guard with these features. After reading the benefits of screen guards, one can realize that they are more than just a thin film on the screen. They offer great advantages and the importance of having a protector should never be ignored. It would be a tough challenge to choose the right one, but one should understand the need of the electric device and select the one that can compliment.    Risks & ChallengesWe have been doing our due diligence on this product for over three months from prototyping to testing.

We want to use one piece strong metal plate to simplify our design. Beginning of our developing stage, the plate's tension was too strong and both hands needed to open the clamp. It was completely against our fundamental concept of design: ease of usage. The clamp had to be one hand and simple operation while keeping tension enough for secured grip. After wasting enormous raw material of trial and error, we finally made a corrected tension spring plate that met our concept needs: ease of use like paper clip and secure enough grips like clamps of crap. </p><p>During this period, our engineer discovered that we could improve the main clamp function by letting upper clamp in motion only. Truly it helped to improve stability of clamps when inserting a cell phone. </p><p>Plastic body was light weight and strong enough. But it was easy to live scratch marks. We solved the problem by applying entire plastic parts with ""scratch-free"" silicon coating.</p><p>Currently we are running pilot sales on various online stores at South Korea. And it is very successful and left more than 95% positive feed backs. We are now ready to start mass production and start spreading our products over the world market.

We want to use one piece strong metal plate to simplify our design. Beginning of our developing stage, the plate's tension was too strong and both hands needed to open the clamp. It was completely against our fundamental concept of design: ease of usage. The clamp had to be one hand and simple operation while keeping tension enough for secured grip. After wasting enormous raw material of trial and error, we finally made a corrected tension spring plate that met our concept needs: ease of use like paper clip and secure enough grips like clamps of crap. During this period, our engineer discovered that we could improve the main clamp function by letting upper clamp in motion only. Truly it helped to improve stability of clamps when inserting a cell phone. Plastic body was light weight and strong enough. But it was easy to live scratch marks. We solved the problem by applying entire plastic parts with ""scratch-free"" silicon coating.Currently we are running pilot sales on various online stores at South Korea. And it is very successful and left more than 95% positive feed backs. We are now ready to start mass production and start spreading our products over the world market. We are sure that we can achieve this goal with your supports.",32.0,4,"1 Campaign

<h2>The <u>HandBand</u>™ Is Function... <i>&amp;</i> <i>Fashion</i> For Your Phone.</h2>
<p>When looped around and through a phone’s fitted case, this art-inspired, custom-designed, soft elastic band produces a secure hold that allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hold your device without gripping or cramping your fingers</li>
<li>Wear your device and allow you to be hands-free </li>
<li>Mount your device for easy viewing </li>
</ul>
<p>Keep your phone safe from drops and dirty surfaces.</p>

<h3>Hi! I’m Tiffany Twist.</h3>
<p>I am an entrepreneur, business owner, inventor, author, product creator...</p>
<p>And, all I do, I do to my very best and I just happen to have a lot of passion, and fire - plenty for multiple business ventures, and adventures. I love to share what I know, and help who I can, and just live a full, happy life, <i>because</i> I can. (It was quite a  journey to discover THAT, however!)</p>
<p>One day, a while back, I took an elastic band off of a sweatsuit set I had purchased from a store in the mall. We were going on vacation and, as I was packing that sweet, little sweatsuit into my suitcase, I somehow came up with a plan to put this elastic band around my phone case and secure it to my phone. I wore it the whole vacation and it made me feel better to not have the anxiety of thinking I might set my phone down somewhere and walk away, lose it, or have it stolen. </p>
<p>Although, I was many times told I should market that little phone accessory I created, I was really busy with a hair extension product I’d also created and, adding long hair to one’s head without damage was, my hyper-focus. </p>
<p>Still, the thought of how this little elastic band had helped me along the way, stayed with me. </p>
<p>Years later, I was spring cleaning and found another elastic band (I had forgotten I'd purchased 2 of those sweatsuits all those years ago!)</p>
<p>I secured it to my phone's case, and now, when people said, ""hey - you should market that,"" I was ready. You have to be on mailing list or listen to my podcast to know why though :-)</p>

As a summer project, while he was out of school, my teenager and I talked about the idea of creating this and, since I'd taken a course on making a funny sales video, I wanted an experimental product to do that with. Since he's grown up watching me do the entrepreneurial thing and has given me sound advice even, I asked if he wanted in on this which is how he became an investor in his first business as a high-school sophomore.
From there we spent the summer:

Creating a logo, tagline and branding plan
Designing prototypes and packaging
Securing trademarks and patents
Sampling manufacturers
Testing wearability
Scripting and filming our sales video
Creating customer communications and our sales page 






The Art is the Heart...
When I conceived this idea, I saw many designs on the bands but I knew my limitations in creating those designs. 

 
So, I decided that involving the community would be a great idea. That artists and photographers and anyone, really, could send design ideas for the HandBand, be voted on or selected, and then have their idea produced, and, after that. even share in proceeds through personalized affiliate payout links to their product.
 

 
We're Ready to Ship!
Being able to understand our workflow will be key for us to get out into the marketplace. Knowing how many designs we can produce, and if wholesale for companies is desired and how to manage that are some of the things we will be accessing while working with crowdfunding platforms. Our customers and backers who have the understanding of the number of factors that go into a start-up is essential for us to grow and learn as we do.
Shipping current stock through December 15th. 

​We'd love to build a sell-able product and, ultimately, have created a sellable business. I think this can go big and to be the ones who knew it at conceptions is pretty cool. You guys can be in with me on that:-)

<h3><b>Swivel Point Story</b></h3>The idea to create Swivel Point sunglasses and goggles actually came to me when I had an unfortunate accident while downhill mountain biking and when I went over the handle bars and landed on my helmet, I got up and discovered that the camera on my helmet had been damaged beyond repair. I was very upset about this and thought there has to be a better way to record video while doing the things you enjoy. I started thinking why not integrate the camera into your sunglasses or goggles? Of course I also thought that someone must have already thought of this too and they must be already available so I started to search the internet and sure enough I found that there were glasses and goggles with integrated cameras available to be purchased but the problem was I didn’t like the design or the price. They looked too bulky, heavy, and uncomfortable and were too expensive for me and so I thought why not come up with my own design and then search for a manufacturing partner and see if they can make them for me. In order to do this I was going to need a photo-realistic rendering or blueprint to send to the potential manufacturer and so I contacted a good friend of mine who is an artist and graphic designer and asked him if he could help me out, he said of course what a cool idea and created the picture below for me:<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448529007/ol1nus1ulavehbztsob5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>I then began searching for a manufacturing partner in the electronics manufacturing capital of the world Shenzhen China. It didn’t take long to discover a very capable manufacturing partner that is a leader in wearable technology and is capable of producing up to 2000 pairs a day of the glasses or goggles as long as there is enough supply of materials. This was very exciting but I also wanted to be sure that they would be of the highest quality and so I was also very pleased to find out that they’re ISO9001 certified and have a very strict quality control system. All products are strictly inspected before, during and after production and only first class materials are used to assure the performance and durability. Their quality control people will go the extra mile to examine materials in their supplier’s warehouse before the materials enter their factory, and then their warehouse staff will check them out again when they receive them. The products are tested one by one on the production line and after production, and their quality assurance people will make a final inspection before being shipped out. They have a dedicated R&amp;D team consisting of 3 engineers and 5 technicians that are able to ensure that only the latest in cutting edge technology is incorporated into their products. It didn’t take long for them to come up with a working prototype of my idea. We were also able to come up with some new innovative concepts to evolve my idea even further by incorporating Bluetooth to listen to music and answer calls and also WiFi to stream live video to your smart phone when connected at WiFi hot spots by using a free app on your phone.</div><div>
<br/><p>Bluetooth Innovations is a startup a company and we’re very excited to get our Swivel Point glasses and goggles out to the market but we need your help! We need you to please contribute and help us raise the needed funds to ramp up production and also create our online store. It is very difficult to start a business without sufficient startup capital and so we’re hoping you will help us out and be the one of the first people to try out our glasses and goggles. I have already tried them out myself and I think they’re awesome! I shot some really cool footage some of which you can see in our video above that was shot a couple of months ago in Vancouver and Whistler B.C. I also really enjoy using the glasses to listen to music and make and answer calls hands free. I’m very excited to hear what you think of them so please help us out, make a contribution and enjoy your perks! We thank you so much for your support and please also help us spread the word!</p>

<h3>Hi! My name is Raz and I created the smartest, most powerful solar charge controller for its size.</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Inti C14 is the smartest, most powerful portable solar charge controller ever designed. If you like camping, traveling with your RV or just preparing yourself for electrical outages, Inti is a device you must have.</p>
<p>  <img alt=""Inti C14 Exploded View Animated"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://www.thornwave.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/exploded-med.gif"" src="""" style=""""/> <img alt=""Camping"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://www.thornwave.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/indiegogo.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Here are some of Inti's features </p>
<ul>
<li>small, portable yet powerful (up to 400W). The typical camping solar charger usually handles significantly less power(less than 50W)</li>
<li>no wiring required, just plug and play</li>
<li>can take universal power, from solar panels, a car DC socket or an AC adapter</li>
<li>can charge any battery chemistry with a voltage up to 30V. Can even boost the input voltage allowing 12V panels or a 12V DC socket to charge a 24V battery</li>
<li>equipped with Bluetooth Smart (LE) so you can monitor and configure it</li>
<li>USB data port allows it to be configured and monitored using a computer. It can also work as a battery analyzer / data logger</li>
<li>customize the charging algorithm using the supplied software or via Bluetooth</li>
<li>protected against reverse polarity and over-heating</li>
<li>can work as a solar power regulator, directly powering your equipment. The battery is not required.</li>
<li>allows you to build your solar system for use while camping or off-the-grid for less than $500. Similar systems, that have the battery already integrated, will cost even $1500. Also, similar products might advertise an output power of 160W to 300W. Don't get confused by output power versus stored energy. Those systems have an integrated battery but the energy storage is a lot less than the DIY battery that you will use with Inti. A system comparable with Inti, in terms of energy storage, is the Goal Zero, Yeti 1250. The price of this system is well over $1000. Yeti 1250 has an integrated inverter but I explained in one of my newsletters (see below) why there is no need for an inverter while camping. It actually is a useless drain of energy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are you a solar geek? Do you care about going green and saving our environment while at the same time providing yourself and your friends with a more comfortable camping experience? Do you like to create and build things? Then Inti is for you. You can build your own solar system and you will learn a lot more about solar power at the same time. I will teach you how to build your power bank for Inti. It's super easy and you can do it on a budget. It will be fun!</p>

</div><div><p>Inti C14 is in the prototype stage. I have fully functional prototypes. The campaign funds will go towards the required certifications, setting up the mass production and finishing the software development. For the project to even get in the vicinity of financially feasible I need to manufacture at least 1000 units. The firmware is 98% functional and is of production quality. The PC software is 90% functional. The Android application is half written and with limited functionality while the iOS application is not started yet. Help me get all this done and ship the product by summer !</p></div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What can I do with Inti?</h3>
<p>Imagine going camping and not having to deal with bringing ice for the coolers or buying batteries for your flashlights and camping lights. Imagine using an electric heated blanket at night or recharging your mobile devices. If you are camping because you want to be in nature and pursue your hobbies like photography, RC planes / drones, HAM radios you can use Inti to power your gear as well. You can even power your laptop. You can use Inti in your car to recharge any battery you want. You can even use it to recharge your car battery from solar panels or an AC adapter. </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Do you want to get more technical?</h3>
<p>Here are some technical details:</p>
<ul>
<li>output current up to 14A, either for charging the battery or directly powering your equipment - configurable through software</li>
<li>output voltage up to 30V. It can charge 24V batteries. The output voltage can be configured through software.</li>
<li>universal input voltage 10V - 48V DC. It will automatically detect if the input comes from solar panels or an AC/DC source. If the input comes from solar panels, Inti will use MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) to harvest the solar energy efficiently. If the input is an AC/DC source Inti will only use the configured input current limit in order to protect the supply.</li>
<li>maximum input current of 10A, electronically limited and configurable through software. This will protect the car DC socket or the AC adapter from overload.</li>
<li>can support any battery chemistry: lead acid, LiFePO, lithium-ion, NiCd and NiMH. Inti can be configured using one of the provided configuration profiles or by creating your own customized profile. Every aspect of the charging process can be customized (WARNING! Lithium based batteries are dangerous to charge and discharge. They can explode. Use this feature only if you know what you are doing and at your own risk!)</li>
<li>Bluetooth Smart allows you to use your cellphone or a tablet to monitor Inti. You can monitor the power your solar panels are producing, the charging process or the amount of solar energy you generated</li>
<li>data logger / battery analyzer - this feature will allow you to record all the important parameters during charging. The parameters are being streamed via USB 100 times per second and visualized on the computer screen using the provided software: intiManager</li>

<p> </p>
<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Configuration profiles? It sounds complicated...</strong></p>
<p>It is not complicated at all. If you found this campaign it means you already are a solar geek. Configuring Inti is simple, plus you only have to do it once when you receive it and you decide what kind of battery are you going to be using. I will have some tutorial videos where I will show you how to do that. Inti will also ship already configured for the most common and cheap type of battery used: 12V SLA (sealed lead acid) so if you use this you will not have to do anything. Just plug and play!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What do I need for Inti to work?</strong></p>
<p>On top of Inti, you will need, obviously, solar panels and a battery. Again, I will have videos explaining all this. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Will all this stuff fit in my trunk? How am I going to transport them to the campsite?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! Inti can fit even in your pocket. The solar panels are probably the largest component but if you opt for semi-flexible panels they are light and thin so you can easily stack a few together. The battery will surely be the heaviest part but you can choose the size you need. The beauty of this project is that you can customize the final system to fit your needs. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How many panels do I need and what kind of battery?</strong></p>
<p>You can also go to my newsletters that I sent to my subscribers before the campaign started and you can find a lot more information. I will give you a summary here:</p>
<p>It depends on what you want to power. If you only want to recharge mobile devices and flashlight batteries go for a single 50W panel (or even smaller) and a small battery or skip the battery entirely. </p>
<p>If you want to power a DC refrigerator you will need at least 100-150W of solar panels power and a bigger battery. The system I use has 4 x 50W panels and a 12V, 100Ah marine deep cycle battery. This can keep my ARB refrigerator running for about 60 hours continously even if there is no sun to recharge the battery.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why power Inti from the car DC socket?</strong></p>
<p>So you can keep the camping battery charged while you are in the car driving towards the campsite.</p>
<p> </p>

Yeti 1250 has an integrated inverter but I explained in one of my newsletters (see below) why there is no need for an inverter while camping. It actually is a useless drain of energy.

Are you a solar geek? Do you care about going green and saving our environment while at the same time providing yourself and your friends with a more comfortable camping experience? Do you like to create and build things? Then Inti is for you. You can build your own solar system and you will learn a lot more about solar power at the same time. I will teach you how to build your power bank for Inti. It's super easy and you can do it on a budget. It will be fun!
 
Where is Inti now?
Inti C14 is in the prototype stage. I have fully functional prototypes. The campaign funds will go towards the required certifications, setting up the mass production and finishing the software development. For the project to even get in the vicinity of financially feasible I need to manufacture at least 1000 units. The firmware is 98% functional and is of production quality. The PC software is 90% functional. The Android application is half written and with limited functionality while the iOS application is not started yet. Help me get all this done and ship the product by summer !
 
What can I do with Inti?
Imagine going camping and not having to deal with bringing ice for the coolers or buying batteries for your flashlights and camping lights. Imagine using an electric heated blanket at night or recharging your mobile devices. If you are camping because you want to be in nature and pursue your hobbies like photography, RC planes / drones, HAM radios you can use Inti to power your gear as well. You can even power your laptop. You can use Inti in your car to recharge any battery you want. You can even use it to recharge your car battery from solar panels or an AC adapter.

Do you want to get more technical?
Here are some technical details:

output current up to 14A, either for charging the battery or directly powering your equipment - configurable through software
output voltage up to 30V. It can charge 24V batteries. The output voltage can be configured through software.
universal input voltage 10V - 48V DC. It will automatically detect if the input comes from solar panels or an AC/DC source. If the input comes from solar panels, Inti will use MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) to harvest the solar energy efficiently. If the input is an AC/DC source Inti will only use the configured input current limit in order to protect the supply.
maximum input current of 10A, electronically limited and configurable through software. This will protect the car DC socket or the AC adapter from overload.
can support any battery chemistry: lead acid, LiFePO, lithium-ion, NiCd and NiMH. Inti can be configured using one of the provided configuration profiles or by creating your own customized profile. Every aspect of the charging process can be customized (WARNING! Lithium based batteries are dangerous to charge and discharge. They can explode. Use this feature only if you know what you are doing and at your own risk!)
Bluetooth Smart allows you to use your cellphone or a tablet to monitor Inti. You can monitor the power your solar panels are producing, the charging process or the amount of solar energy you generated
data logger / battery analyzer - this feature will allow you to record all the important parameters during charging. The parameters are being streamed via USB 100 times per second and visualized on the computer screen using the provided software: intiManager

Here is the data log for charging a 60Ah LiFePO battery using an AC adapter.
 

And here is charging the same battery but with solar panels. The dips in the power are because it was a cloudy day - numerous clouds blocking the sun. The big dip is because the panels ended up shaded by some trees and I had to move them back into the sun. The charging current is the orange waveform.
 
What will I get?
You will receive a box containing one Inti C14 solar charger, one small USB cable, and one adapter cable from an Anderson Power Plug PP45 connector to bare wires. More adapters will be available. I will show you where you can purchase them.
 
I want more!
I have more information for you.
Here is my professional profile: http://www.thetraz.com
You can see the newsletters I sent to my subscribers. Look inside. I also give details and parts you can buy to build your battery.

Frequently Asked Questions
 
Configuration profiles? It sounds complicated...
It is not complicated at all. If you found this campaign it means you already are a solar geek. Configuring Inti is simple, plus you only have to do it once when you receive it and you decide what kind of battery are you going to be using. I will have some tutorial videos where I will show you how to do that. Inti will also ship already configured for the most common and cheap type of battery used: 12V SLA (sealed lead acid) so if you use this you will not have to do anything. Just plug and play!
 
What do I need for Inti to work?
On top of Inti, you will need, obviously, solar panels and a battery. Again, I will have videos explaining all this. 
 
Will all this stuff fit in my trunk? How am I going to transport them to the campsite?
Yes! Inti can fit even in your pocket. The solar panels are probably the largest component but if you opt for semi-flexible panels they are light and thin so you can easily stack a few together. The battery will surely be the heaviest part but you can choose the size you need. The beauty of this project is that you can customize the final system to fit your needs. 
 
How many panels do I need and what kind of battery?
You can also go to my newsletters that I sent to my subscribers before the campaign started and you can find a lot more information. I will give you a summary here:
It depends on what you want to power. If you only want to recharge mobile devices and flashlight batteries go for a single 50W panel (or even smaller) and a small battery or skip the battery entirely. 
If you want to power a DC refrigerator you will need at least 100-150W of solar panels power and a bigger battery. The system I use has 4 x 50W panels and a 12V, 100Ah marine deep cycle battery. This can keep my ARB refrigerator running for about 60 hours continously even if there is no sun to recharge the battery.
 
Why power Inti from the car DC socket?
So you can keep the camping battery charged while you are in the car driving towards the campsite.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>It's the year 2017 and yet counterfeit currency and IDs is an everyday problem businesses all across the United States face. According to Department of Treasury estimated, One out of every 4,000 to 10,000 bills in circulation may be counterfeit.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488862412/fy6qr6vv3xzdqdoowboa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The clunky and non-portable devices currency available in the market detect fake bills and IDs are archaic and unreliable. </p>
<p>With this Moto Mod we are trying to help businesses and individuals never get cheated again. Using a set of multiple LEDs, we have built a Mod and an accompanying app that can help users tell an original, government issues ID or bill from a fake.</p>
<h3>Traveling</h3>
<p>While traveling to a foreign country we are more likely being targeted for counterfeit banknotes and IDs.  UV Vision Mod can help us to protect us from these scams by listing all the UV light areas to look for in every currency.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488862556/gafojznnvhaaqjt1dbf4.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>During our travel our hotel beds can also be problematic sometimes, with bed bugs or other gross things attached to it.  UV Vision Mod can easily help us to see the truth behind the bedsheets.  If the bedsheet was not washed there will be UV stains left over.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488862893/zxbl4rjhgs0j0og7hw0k.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other benefits</h3>
<p><strong>House cleaning</strong>: Ever wonder your house is really clean?  UV Vision Mod can help  you to find out.  Left over stains will be there until you fully clean them.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488862937/t9frhfnhc2x5hsu3j4fg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Laundry</strong>: You can also see whether you laundry is dirty, as well as see if your friends or co-workers are wearing dirty cloth!</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
It's the year 2017 and yet counterfeit currency and IDs is an everyday problem businesses all across the United States face. According to Department of Treasury estimated, One out of every 4,000 to 10,000 bills in circulation may be counterfeit.

The clunky and non-portable devices currency available in the market detect fake bills and IDs are archaic and unreliable. 
With this Moto Mod we are trying to help businesses and individuals never get cheated again. Using a set of multiple LEDs, we have built a Mod and an accompanying app that can help users tell an original, government issues ID or bill from a fake.
Traveling
While traveling to a foreign country we are more likely being targeted for counterfeit banknotes and IDs.  UV Vision Mod can help us to protect us from these scams by listing all the UV light areas to look for in every currency.

 
During our travel our hotel beds can also be problematic sometimes, with bed bugs or other gross things attached to it.  UV Vision Mod can easily help us to see the truth behind the bedsheets.  If the bedsheet was not washed there will be UV stains left over.

 
Other benefits
House cleaning: Ever wonder your house is really clean?  UV Vision Mod can help  you to find out.  Left over stains will be there until you fully clean them.

Laundry: You can also see whether you laundry is dirty, as well as see if your friends or co-workers are wearing dirty cloth!
 
Photography: UV photography is also something that's really fun to place with, combining with cell phone camera we can make unique photographs to share on facebook which gives us an edge.

Photograph by Simeon Berg using UV lights.
There are many other fun and useful possibilities you can do with UV Vision Mod, all it takes is creativity.
Features

UV Light across different spectrum, this way we can detect everything across UV spectrum
Separate battery source, we will be able to use UV Vision Mod independently, alongside with the phone.


What We Need & What You Get

We have successfully built the first prototype and looking for funds to:

Do more rigorous testing of the Moto Mod
Mass production



The Impact
According to the United States Department of Treasury, an estimated $70 million to $200 million in counterfeit bills are in circulation. With our product, we are looking to eradicate the problem of fake US denomination and help businesses and government. 
Risks & Challenges

There can be delays at the manufacturing facilities if the factory falls behind schedule, or shipping timetables can be delayed due to weather, equipment, carriers or simply human error. Exporting product over any holiday season can also add unforeseen delays and there is always the risk that items make it all the way to its destination and they get held up in customs for some unknown reason!
Please understand that a more advanced product than initially planned might postpone deliveries. This additional change may also have an influence on the final size and weight of the product.
No matter what uncertainties there may be, we are always here to solve our for our customer and stand behind ZeroLemon. You can reach us at info@zerolemon.com at any time for any concerns.

</div><p></p><p></p><p></p></div>","At Feel we hate keys. They are bulky, annoying, easy to lose and it's never fun trying to find the right one for the right lock. We thought it was time to put those problems behind us, so we created Lokit. By using Lokit and your smartphone, you'll always have easy access to all the important things in your life, at the click of a button. We made Lokit smart so you don't need to think. No more searching for keys or remembering combinations. Simply downloaded the free iOS or Android app, Lokit automatically pairs to your Bluetooth 4.0 enabled smartphone and you are good to go.To unlock Lokit, simply press the shackle. Lokit wakes up and searches for your phone. If the phone is within a few feet, Lokit will instantly unlock so you can be on your way. No need to launch an app or remove your phone from your pocket or purse.If you have a specific reason to limit the range or turn off the auto-unlock feature, you can do this within the app. In order to unlock with the auto-unlock feature turned off, you can simply press unlock button in the app. This will allow you to lock your phone in a locker or stand near your lock without fear of it being unlocked. Your gym locker, sheds, safety deposit boxes, farm gates, toolboxes, bags and bikes - if the lock fits, use it. Luckily Lokit has a standard padlock barrel which means it will fit almost every lock.
You will probably want to use Lokit on your bicycle or maybe even your gym locker, so we gave you the option to get a bike mount, and you can use your second Lokit once you arrive. Available for only $20.







Lokit is a padlock that is as touch as any old school lock with new school smarts that are simple enough for anyone to use.

Attractive. We designed Lokit to look as good as it functions with a body the same size as an ordinary padlock but with subtle curves and bevels to complement its aesthetic. The compact size allows Lokit to be used anywhere you'd use a traditional padlock.



Tough as an Ox. While Lokit is an incredibly attractive device, we also made it strong. Using hardened steel and boron, Lokit will stand up to the toughest environments. 
Stubborn as a mule. Scared it might get wet? Don't be. We use silicone gaskets to keep the water out.
Love you Long Time Battery. Lokit also has an extra long-life battery. If you use Lokit infrequently, it should last a few years and when it comes time to replace the battery its simple enough for your gran to do it.





Smarter Security. Lokit uses Bluetooth 4.0 which contains the highest level of security. Bluetooth 4.0 uses a 128-bit AES CCM encryption algorithm. Making security smarter.



Unlike many other campaigns we have spent months in development, prototype creation testing and are now ready for market. This campaign will allow us to get reduced pre-retail rates through mass production. This means if you back us you save over $30 on the retail costs and we can have your order shipped to you within 30 days of the campaign ending.



Compatible with iOS devices that have Bluetooth 4.0 hardware and running iOS 7.0 or later (including iPhone 4s or newer, iPod Touch 5G or newer, iPad 3G or newer, iPad minis).
Compatible with Android devices that have Bluetooth 4.0 hardware and  running the Jelly Bean (4.3) or Kit Kat (4.4) or higher versions of the Android operating system (including Samsung Galaxy S4 or newer, HTC One or newer, and several more).



Lokit is the slimmest bluetooth lock on the market but still packs a punch. The silicone gasket inside and outside of the circuit board keeps it well protected from the elements. It weighs in at 220g (7.7 oz), the lock body is made with with zinc alloy and high strength stainless steel.

<p><span>My name is </span><b>Thomas Schuh</b><span> from Germany. For the last five years, I've been living in Turkey with my family.

<h2></h2>
<p style=""letter-spacing: normal;"">As you know, in the end we always have a problem with our device batteries dying at the wrong time. And usually a charging cable isn't on hand. One day, I started to think about this common problem. I always try to solve problems in a practical way. I came up with the idea to create a battery cable that would always be with the phone. When I began to think about this problem, I realized this not only concerned me, but also millions of others who were fed up with carrying a charging cable in a bag that is always entangled among their personal items and just created chaos everywhere they went. I invented the SOSO to help people save time, be practical, and forget about the unnecessary worry that their device battery could die at the wrong time.</p>

SOSO - The Next Evolution in Phone and Tablet Charging. 

Tired of carrying your charging cables where ever you go? Tired of tangled cords? 
SOSO has the answer.
Your case IS your cord. Tangle free. No Mess. No Fuss. 
We’ve created a charger and case in one that's reliable, time saving, and tangle free. 
The SOSO Charge Case is sleek and beautiful in design. Its convenience will improve your daily life.












It's a simple product, yet so useful that we believe everyone should own one.
The SOSO Charge Case is designed with a USB charger that wraps around the back, so that anywhere you bring your phone, you can stop worrying about running out of battery. Whether you have an iPhone or an iPad , the SOSO Charge Case is compatible, because its USB cord can be used in conjunction with any port. 
Wrapped and bent in a labyrinthine shape, our cable rests flat against the case, making transportation no more difficult than transportation of your smartphone without a case and charger – and much, much safer. 


                           
We found a solution ...

using a labyrinth shape, the cord easily fits on the back of the case . 
When you buy a new smartphone, the first two things you think of are always the same: you need a CASE, and you need a CHARGER. Without the case, your phone will break. Without the charger, your phone doesn't last long. The SOSO Charge Case is the perfect solution to these problems. A charger and case in one. 









Usable in all situations








 








Consumer Friendly
So clever

up to 1 meter long on the backside .
It folds into different positions to create a stand for reading, viewing, typing or making FaceTime calls. And it's easy to remove, so you can snap it on a off whenever you want. 


Allows full accessibility to all functions and ports.

   Yes, we signed the patent in March 2015      










My name is Thomas Schuh from Germany. For the last five years, I've been living in Turkey with my family. This idea was inspired by my five year old son Leon, who loves to play with my phone. Like many parents, we often let our children play with our phones and tablets.




As you know, in the end we always have a problem with our device batteries dying at the wrong time. And usually a charging cable isn't on hand. One day, I started to think about this common problem. I always try to solve problems in a practical way. I came up with the idea to create a battery cable that would always be with the phone. When I began to think about this problem, I realized this not only concerned me, but also millions of others who were fed up with carrying a charging cable in a bag that is always entangled among their personal items and just created chaos everywhere they went. I invented the SOSO to help people save time, be practical, and forget about the unnecessary worry that their device battery could die at the wrong time.
Right now, we are turning to you, Indiegogo, for help raising $25,000. This startup capital will cover the costs of manufacturing the Soso combo case-and-charger. With your contributions, we can get this product out onto the market where it belongs, changing the world of smartphones forever.

The
impact
Set up the day you start wearing your new pair contact lenses, fill up the tank with your preferred solution, and enjoy the experience. Blink is a multifunctional contact lens device with two main purposes: 
Firstly, it tackles the main problems that you encounter when interacting with you contact lenses, such as forgetting to change them after the prescribed 15 or 30 day period, and spilling the solution when removing the lenses from the case;
Secondly and more importantly, it ensures to keep your eyes infection-free, from any potential contact with bacteria when misusing your contact lenses. 
Do red and itchy eyes sound familiar? They shouldn’t and we want to make sure they won't.Design 







  






Packaging




Before using Blink: Overuse of lenses, spillage of solution and increased exposure to bacteria.
After: Correct and hygienic maintenance of contacts and case while saving time and solution.

What we need and why?
Help us raise the £5,000 that will bring the device to the market and make your life more comfortable. Help us create Blink, for you. 
The donations will be used to improve the existing prototype of Blink in order to make sure we deliver the best quality product for your eyes. We will hire a specialist, and make sure the entire system is functional. Once the product is created successfully, we will bring it to the market for your enjoyment.

Our Challenges
In order to bring Blink to the market we will need the support of companies with technological and manufacturing capabilities. Thus, by creating a big community of supporters, and a successful prototype, we will overcome such challenges. 

Your help

<h3><strong>A Problem Worth Solving:</strong></h3>
<p>Working with our phones and tablets have become an everyday routine for almost all of us. To use those devices, we usually have to use both our hands, and we have to raise one hand once in every few seconds to touch the glass screen.</p>
<p>We all have faced situations when we must use our phone, but one of our hands is occupied holding something such as a bar in the metro, a bag, books and documents, or even a coat.</p>
<p>Just imagine how easy it can be to hold your phone, and use it by moving your finger gently on the back of the phone. Imagine reading web pages, checking your friends’ Instagram, reading a book or even playing games with just one hand.</p>

<h3>Our Invention:</h3>
<p>We thought why wouldn't it possible to interact with the backside of our phone, just like we do it on the screen? The backside of our phones are all wasted space. They could be used otherwise.</p>
<p>Imagine you could read a news article on your phone and scroll it up or down with your finger on the back of your phone. How easy and pleasant it could be to use your phone like that.</p>
<p>Or imagine standing in the metro, with one of your hands grabbing a bar. And you want to use your phone during the ride. Walking to your work with a suitcase in your hand, you don't like bothering yourself putting it on the ground from time to time, to work with your phone.</p>
<p>It's not just that much! Think how fun it could be if you could play a racer's game on your phone, with one of your fingers as acceleration pedal, and the other one as a brake, both on back of your phone. No obstructing the screen as well. It could be extremely fun to play games on your phone like that.</p>
<p>We have invented and developed a magical phone cover. In the first glimpse, there's nothing unusual with that. The magic starts when you wear it on your phone. After following on-screen instructions that take less than 10 seconds to complete, you will start enjoying your phone in a brand new way, never experienced before.</p>

By supporting this project, not only you support us make a wonderful product, but you are also among the first people who get and use our cover made specifically for your phone model.""</p>
<p>________________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>YOU WILL NEVER WANT TO USE YOUR PHONE LIKE THE WAY YOU USE IT NOW, AFTER HAVING OUR COVER.</h3>
<p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://torudica.sirv.com/GIFs/ezgif.com-video-to-gif-11.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The back of your phone will function as a touch-sensitive surface. But wait a moment! You always hold your phone on its back, and unlike the screen, your hands are always in constant contact with the back of your phone. Does it cause any trouble? Does it cause the phone act like you've randomly touched the screen with all your fingers?</p>
<p>The answer is a simple ""No"", thanks to a very complicated brain we implanted inside the cover. From day one, when we started building this cover, our number-one challenge was to teach the cover to distinguish between the unintentional touch of your palm, hands, and fingers on the back of your phone, with intentional touches and strokes you do to command your phone - just like you always do on the screen.</p>
<p><strong>With over 3,000 touch and stroke types tests</strong>, analyzed individually and independently, we could overcome the challenge by designing complex AI (Artificial Intelligence) algorithms that turns the cover into an intelligent assistant, who knows when you want to do something on your phone, and when you normally hold your phone, put it into your bag or pocket, put it somewhere, and take it like you always do.</p>
<p>The moment you wear the cover on your phone, you will see how pleasantly your cover fits in your hand. You are not asked to do anything special. It's just like other ordinary covers. Wear it on your phone, and enjoy. From the first moments, you will experience your phone working just like it doesn't have any cover on its back. You don't need to worry holding your phone, putting it and bringing it in or out of your pocket, leaving your phone on the table, even rubbing your hands on the back of your phone repeatedly! You can do all of these like you always did, thanks to the intelligent brain software we equipped One Hand Touch with.</p>

<h3>Who Will Benefit? And How?</h3>
<p>You will benefit the product, because it enables you to expand your phone's capabilities to brand new dimensions, at relatively no cost.</p>
<p>Imagine a major phone manufacturing company such as Apple, Samsung or Huawei, add such a capability to their pioneer phones. They will charge us hundreds of dollars for the technology. And there will only be a limited number of phones that would have such a technology. Yet, companies are busy doing other stuff with phones and they have not yet developed a capability to use the back of our phones like we use the front.</p>
<p>Now with only $20 (for the first 1,000 units), you can use one of 50 beautifully designed phone covers that support most iOS and Android phones (list of supported phones at the end of the page). The price will typically rise to $40-$60 when this fundraising campaign ends.</p>
<p>The main benefits of using One Hand Touch covers are:</p>
<ol>
<li>You will no longer need to use both of your hands to work with your phone on every occasion.</li>
<li>You can use your phone with just one hand, reading articles, surfing web pages, tapping like on Instagram, zooming in and out photos, answering or rejecting phone, playing and navigating music, using maps, playing games, etc.</li>
<li>Your thumb is usually the main victim of using your phone with one hand when you need it now. Its muscles start having pain when you use your phone with one hand for a few minutes in a row. Studies have proven that using your phone with one hand is a danger for your health. Your hands and fingers will start having problems as you use your phone more and more, and as you age. With One Hand Touch, you will eliminate this danger in more than 90% of the cases, thus you will ensure your hands will remain healthy forever. (Ref: <a href=""https://bit.ly/2tRR6d1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://bit.ly/2tRR6d1</a>)</li>
<li>Not only you will use your phone with one hand easily with our cover, you can expand your joy to experiencing new realms on your phone, either with one hand or two: you can use back of your phone as a gamepad. Play Angry Birds, and swipe the back of your phone to pull the stretch to throw the birds even farther! Swipe down with a finger on your left hand on the back of your phone to enable Nitro in a race car, and use the other finger to brake. There are just hundreds of new capabilities and tricks you add to your phone that are beyond words.</li>

<h3>One Hand Touch For Medical Purposes / Disabled People:</h3>
<p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://torudica.sirv.com/GIFs/ezgif.com-video-to-gif-2.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As shown in the video above, people with disability in hand have no choice but using their smartphones in a very disturbing way, with lots of difficulties.</p>
<p>We all must cherish the fact that health is a gift that we usually take it for granted. Disabled people can have a lot of problems doing the things we normally do with no effort. Working with the phone is definitely one of them. Companies have so far done almost nothing in terms of hardware to support handicapped and disabled people. Almost all solutions were within the software world, like accessibility options and gestures for the disabled on iOS, Android, and Windows Phone.</p>
<p>One Hand Touch solves many of the problems for those people who have difficulty using their phones with two hands. Stroke survivors face a harder time trying to use smartphone devices. Due to some limitation, they are not able to easily use their devices as easily as they would like.</p>
<p>Hospitals have become more mobile device enabled. One Hand Touch revolutionizes the way hospital handle their mobile devices.</p>
<p>One Hand Touch allows bed rested patients be able to easily use their devices. One hand gesture control allows full control of their smart device.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1530545246/xm7u7qwkbhrn5kqddcxv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>ONE HAND TOUCH Designed For Specific Applications:</h3>
<p>Due to the nature of the product that eliminates the frequent need of touching screen for the user in order to interact with his/her smartphone and tablet, One hand Touch can adapt to certain applications and make it even easier for users to interact with specific applications.</p>
<p><strong>One Hand Touch For Instagram:</strong></p>
<p>By using One hand Touch, Instagram users can enjoy scrolling photos and posts on Instagram with a slight movement of a finger on the back of their smartphones. </p>
<p>Users can also double-tap anywhere on the back of their phones to like their favorite posts.</p>
<p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://torudica.sirv.com/GIFs/ezgif.com-video-to-gif-17.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>One Hand Touch For Reading eBooks:</strong></p>
<p>One hand Touch users can swipe book pages simply by sliding a finger on the back of their phones to either left or right. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://torudica.sirv.com/GIFs/ezgif.com-video-to-gif-11.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>One Hand Touch For Taking Selfies:</strong></p>
<p>Taking Selfies can never be easier with One hand Touch. Users can just point the front camera of their phones at themselves with only one hand and tap back of their phone with the same hand to take a Selfie. No need to hold their other hand up and press anything on the screen. Instant Selfies are possible with only one hand using One hand Touch.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://torudica.sirv.com/GIFs/ezgif.com-video-to-gif-15.gif"" src=""""/> </p>
<p><strong>One Hand Touch For Making Calls:</strong></p>
<p>Whether a user’s phone is turned off or he’s in the middle of a game or app, he can make a simple gesture by his finger on the back of his phone to either accept or reject a call.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>One hand Touch For Playing Games:</strong></p>
<p>The user can play games on his smartphone without having to touch the screen. He can even turn his phone’s orientation into the horizontal (landscape) mode and play a game — such as driving a car using both of his hands, again no screen touch. i.e. his right-hand finger can accelerate a car while his left-hand finger decelerates it.</p>
<p>In portrait mode games too, users can enjoy touching back of the phone to interact with the game environment, as if they are touching the screen.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>One hand Touch For Listening To Music / Watching Movies:</strong></p>
<p>Fast-Forwarding music, changing tracks, sliding a video forward or backward will never require a finger on screen anymore with One hand Touch. Users can enjoy certain taps and touch to interact with music and movies.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>One Hand Touch For YouTubers:</strong></p>
<p>YouTube addicts can enable voice search by a simple double-tap on the back of their phones, scroll search results, slide moves forward and backward, thumb up or down a video and do more by only one hand, one finger, no requirement to touch anywhere on the screen.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>One hand Touch For Surfing Safari — and other web browsers:</strong></p>
<p>Web-browsing means a lot of scrolling. This could never be easier with One hand Touch. Users will not need to hire their second hand to scroll pages up and down. They will just have to slide their finger up and down on the back of their smartphones to surf web pages.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>One Hand Touch For Presentation:</strong></p>
<p>When someone wants to present something on big-screen and projection via his/her smartphone, he might want to point a laser pointer or indicator with his other hand to show what exactly he’s talking about to audience. He can go forward with his presentation using only his phone in his hand and have his other hand free.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>One Hand Touch For Disabled:</strong></p>
<p>People with disabilities, particularly people with one hand have difficulties working with their smartphones and tablets. One hand Touch ensures they can easily use their devices without disturbance.</p>
<p> </p>

You can use your phone with just one hand, reading articles, surfing web pages, tapping like on Instagram, zooming in and out photos, answering or rejecting phone, playing and navigating music, using maps, playing games, etc.
Your thumb is usually the main victim of using your phone with one hand when you need it now. Its muscles start having pain when you use your phone with one hand for a few minutes in a row. Studies have proven that using your phone with one hand is a danger for your health. Your hands and fingers will start having problems as you use your phone more and more, and as you age. With One Hand Touch, you will eliminate this danger in more than 90% of the cases, thus you will ensure your hands will remain healthy forever. (Ref: https://bit.ly/2tRR6d1)
Not only you will use your phone with one hand easily with our cover, you can expand your joy to experiencing new realms on your phone, either with one hand or two: you can use back of your phone as a gamepad. Play Angry Birds, and swipe the back of your phone to pull the stretch to throw the birds even farther! Swipe down with a finger on your left hand on the back of your phone to enable Nitro in a race car, and use the other finger to brake. There are just hundreds of new capabilities and tricks you add to your phone that are beyond words.


 
One Hand Touch For Medical Purposes / Disabled People:
 
As shown in the video above, people with disability in hand have no choice but using their smartphones in a very disturbing way, with lots of difficulties.
We all must cherish the fact that health is a gift that we usually take it for granted. Disabled people can have a lot of problems doing the things we normally do with no effort. Working with the phone is definitely one of them. Companies have so far done almost nothing in terms of hardware to support handicapped and disabled people. Almost all solutions were within the software world, like accessibility options and gestures for the disabled on iOS, Android, and Windows Phone.
One Hand Touch solves many of the problems for those people who have difficulty using their phones with two hands. Stroke survivors face a harder time trying to use smartphone devices. Due to some limitation, they are not able to easily use their devices as easily as they would like.
Hospitals have become more mobile device enabled. One Hand Touch revolutionizes the way hospital handle their mobile devices.
One Hand Touch allows bed rested patients be able to easily use their devices. One hand gesture control allows full control of their smart device.

 
ONE HAND TOUCH Designed For Specific Applications:
Due to the nature of the product that eliminates the frequent need of touching screen for the user in order to interact with his/her smartphone and tablet, One hand Touch can adapt to certain applications and make it even easier for users to interact with specific applications.
One Hand Touch For Instagram:
By using One hand Touch, Instagram users can enjoy scrolling photos and posts on Instagram with a slight movement of a finger on the back of their smartphones. 
Users can also double-tap anywhere on the back of their phones to like their favorite posts.
 
 
One Hand Touch For Reading eBooks:
One hand Touch users can swipe book pages simply by sliding a finger on the back of their phones to either left or right. 
 
One Hand Touch For Taking Selfies:
Taking Selfies can never be easier with One hand Touch. Users can just point the front camera of their phones at themselves with only one hand and tap back of their phone with the same hand to take a Selfie. No need to hold their other hand up and press anything on the screen. Instant Selfies are possible with only one hand using One hand Touch.
 
One Hand Touch For Making Calls:
Whether a user’s phone is turned off or he’s in the middle of a game or app, he can make a simple gesture by his finger on the back of his phone to either accept or reject a call.
 
One hand Touch For Playing Games:
The user can play games on his smartphone without having to touch the screen. He can even turn his phone’s orientation into the horizontal (landscape) mode and play a game — such as driving a car using both of his hands, again no screen touch. i.e. his right-hand finger can accelerate a car while his left-hand finger decelerates it.
In portrait mode games too, users can enjoy touching back of the phone to interact with the game environment, as if they are touching the screen.

 
 
 
One hand Touch For Listening To Music / Watching Movies:
Fast-Forwarding music, changing tracks, sliding a video forward or backward will never require a finger on screen anymore with One hand Touch. Users can enjoy certain taps and touch to interact with music and movies.
 
One Hand Touch For YouTubers:
YouTube addicts can enable voice search by a simple double-tap on the back of their phones, scroll search results, slide moves forward and backward, thumb up or down a video and do more by only one hand, one finger, no requirement to touch anywhere on the screen.
 
One hand Touch For Surfing Safari — and other web browsers:
Web-browsing means a lot of scrolling. This could never be easier with One hand Touch. Users will not need to hire their second hand to scroll pages up and down. They will just have to slide their finger up and down on the back of their smartphones to surf web pages.
 
One Hand Touch For Presentation:
When someone wants to present something on big-screen and projection via his/her smartphone, he might want to point a laser pointer or indicator with his other hand to show what exactly he’s talking about to audience. He can go forward with his presentation using only his phone in his hand and have his other hand free.
 
One Hand Touch For Disabled:
People with disabilities, particularly people with one hand have difficulties working with their smartphones and tablets. One hand Touch ensures they can easily use their devices without disturbance.

And that turns your smartphone into a portable and usable pocket computer. With Qii and your imagination, any surface can be effectively turned into a touch surface and any “dumb” object can be turned into a “smart” object. Nanotechnology and organic electronics make it possible. The idea is simple, but the applications are endless. We've established the company Almakoer to get this to market.</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1161684/files/20150120042959-Black_Qii_unrolled_1.JPG?1421756999"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><b>The Qii QWERTY Computer Keyboard, our first product:</b></p><p></p><p style=""text-align: justify;"">As our first Qii product, we’re offering a full QWERTY computer keyboard, including a number pad and function keys, wirelessly connected to your smartphone or tablet.

<br/>Why we need you ?</h3>
<p>We have already passed a long way to bring the idea of Stereo Ghost to life. After huge R&amp;D and design work, we finally have the working prototypes that have been successfully tested. And we have developed an application that will help you out in an emergency or just to call in 3D Sound call ""Aura"" to Your favorite contacts by pressing only one button in the headphones (Android demo version you can download ). What we need now is with your help, to finalize the implementation of high-quality headphones Sereo Ghost  for call in 3D ""Aura"" and start mass production to bring the device to the world.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Our team</h3>
<p>Our team is not the first year engaged in various development projects in the hardware and software for a variety of customers. Some of which have been very successful. Unfortunately, under the terms of the NDA, we have no right to disclose any information about them. But thanks to them, we got a lot of experience and knowledge. Of course, there were times when we suffered setbacks as any other projects. But all this is tempered us, made stronger.  </p>
<p>CYBERCORP360 LLC &amp; K18 Inc. consists of the departments: Software (application ""PLATON 360"" , ""Ghost""), Hardware ( ""highVoltage"", ""Stereo Ghost"", ""Atomo""), Manufacturing, Law, Financial , Marketing &amp; Media.</p>
<p> Next steps - is finalizing the final version of the product to market and launch a large-scale production. To this end, we are launching a campaign, which resulted in the plan to raise the funds to start mass production with your help.

<p></p></div>","Mobile medical application software for smart phones is becoming ubiquitous due to open source software used in smart phones and the value of mobilizing health care. The modular smart phone uses open source hardware as well as open source software.  Having recognized the potential of this platform, Peritech Electronics is at the forefront of developing clinical and scientific devices using modular technology. Peritech Electronics intends to make use of the modular smart phone platform to develop a series of innovative medical and scientific devices that will be portable and small enough to fit in your pocket but just as powerful as similar conventional devices. However, we need your help to launch our first product.Learn more about the modular phone here:At present we need your support to continue development of our microscope module and launch this unique mobile medical device company.
Our first product, the ""Peri-scope 1”, is a clinically viable,
portable, digital imaging microscope for use with modular smartphone technology. Specifically, the Project-Ara modular phone. 
Why is the Peri-scope 1 important?
Existing infrastructures in many remote regions of the world,
such as sub-Saharan Africa, do not provide sufficient access to quality medical
equipment and services, leaving many hundreds in need of care. However, with
widespread access to smartphones, the infrastructure exists through the phone. The Peri-scope 1 is
designed to utilize this smart phone technology to provide a portable,
self-contained, imaging microscope for use in the field to aid with early
detection of blood borne diseases such as malaria.
You can help us complete our design by contributing (any amount),
by spreading the word, or simply by commenting on our project.  Help us so that we can
help provide millions of under-served with faster care.
Please Note: This is an all or nothing funding campaign so you
will be refunded if we don't meet our goal and therefore are not able to
proceed with the project.What is the Peri-scope
1?Peri-scope 1 is a
modular imaging microscope designed with special application software to
connect with the (soon to be launched) Google Project-Ara modular smart
phone. The Peri-Scope 1 adopts Googles modular phone technology and
combines with the Ara smart-phone to yield a complete imaging microscopy system
slightly larger than a typical smart-phone. 
This is an entirely new (even futuristic) paradigm in portable modular
scientific equipment. Read more about Project-Ara here (Project Ara ).This module will
include optics and an imaging sensor to transform the Project-Ara smart phone
into an affordable, portable, self-contained, and clinically viable imaging
microscope. Needing no external power or computer support, this device will
allow clinically useful imaging microscopy to be performed in remote regions of
the world and in the field.  The Peri-Scope 1 will be an actual scientifically useful imaging

The
Optical Musical Object delivers a great sound and light experience, enhancing
your events. The OMO+ entertains in your home, on your wall, and even on the
water. Its portable, with an integrated 10,800 mAh battery,
all in a waterproof enclosure, keeping the party rocking with lights and sound
for over 8 hours.  Designed to be submerged in 1 meter for 30 minutes, so
that if the kids dunk it, The OMO+ comes up, working faithfully without
fail. With integrated Bluetooth 4.0 technology, you receive 24mbps, for high
fidelity, stereo sound. 
Link 2 OMO+’s together, wirelessly, though the
Bluetooth, and get double enhanced sound and lights! 

We spent the past year
developing the OMO+. It was born out of our desire to have music and lights
where we wanted, when we wanted. The OMO+ has over 40 watts of power with 4
integrated speakers and 2 subs and the Bluetooth 4.0 connectivity allows you to
connect 2 OMO+’s, from 1 tablet or 1 smart phone.OMO+ comes in 4 colors!

Our engineers developed the light show so you control the action, set the lights the way you want. top only, mid only, bottom only or full show! You can even change the colors of the lighting to create the right mood, feeling red hot go red, feeling blue, go with blue, there are many options!
The OMO + has its own carry handle that doubles as a wall mount, carry it, tie it, hang it on the wall, make it art!  OMO+ lets you choose the positions.
The OMO+ can also float in the water for your summer activities! Light up the pool lake or your favorite swimming hole!Our Park City Utah and
Tiawan/China team is working hard to bring your OMO+ to you on time as we have
the development funds secured. Samples are being reviewed by the press and we
are ready to pull the trigger!  We just need that one final boost to make
a splash! 
Please help the OMO+
team to get to market in December, for the holidays. We know you want one...or
two!
The OMO+ has been
featured in the Press. Take a look at some of the articles and what people are
saying.

  What We Need & What You Get Where are we with OMO+?  The Raptor Creative Team is looking for $50,000 in pre-sales to really kick off the retail push for the OMO+ in 2016.  Our team is offering significant value pricing for the early adopters of the OMO+ with prices as low as $99.99 + shipping for 1 OMO+ and $199.99 for 2 OMO+ (you know they link together!) This will be over 50% off retail pricing, but you must get in and pledge early. The retail MSRP will be between $199.99  and $249.99 depending on the retail outlet.  You don't want to miss our Indiegogo offers. We have the tooling completed and are working out the bugs to our samples, If we do not reach our goal we will still be honoring those purchasers that supported our campaign with the OMO+.   


We completed the tooling of the OMO+ and are currently in the process of refining the OMO+ to release for production.  We are days away from pulling the trigger on production!  Look at what we are up to:
