We are two students from Syria and Egypt, currently attending Memorial University of Newfoundland. We created this campaign to help raise money for Syrian refugees through The UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR).


We are fundraising for UNHCR to support and invest in Syrian refugees who need life-saving help!
The Syrian conflict has resulted in the biggest humanitarian crisis of our time. It's been five years since the onset of the civil war in Syria and there is no end in sight. Over 300,000 people have been killed and over half the population has been displaced.
The UNHCR is the best equipped and experienced organization in dealing with such a crisis, and are able to leverage your contribution and maximize its benefit to the refugees.

   What We Need
 We created this campaign to raise $20,000. All the donations will go to the UNHCR to help Syrian refugees. Even if we don't reach our goal by the deadline, all the money raised would still go to the UNHCR as we can't wait for another minute.

Raising money will not only help the refugees to survive during the current crisis, but each and everyone of them will thank you and pray for you deep in their hearts to show their gratefulness. It will also make you feel better to know that you are donating to help the people of your community by showing mercy and affection to those who need it the most. remember every single coin or bill can make a difference.

<p>I escaped over the Berlin wall in East Germany being shot and almost dying. I came to America to be free of political abuse, physical/sexual abuse and transgender abuse for being born different-something that was not my fault! I have tried hard to hide this and to fit in socially. </p>
<p><em><strong>"" Baby I was born this way! ""</strong></em></p>
<p> I want to live my life with dignity as a whole person not as an “hermaphrodite freak” or “he/she/it.”  </p>
<p><strong>Every person in America deserves to have human rights and to live with dignity!</strong></p>
<p>Just six years ago, I was in a head-on collision/car accident. The driver was drunk and was not looking where he was going. Almost every bone in my face was shattered. I remember the flashing lights of an ambulance and was taken to the hospital where I was humiliated by the nurses-the whole staff made me a laughing stock.</p>
<p>While there I received the bare minimum of treatment, was ridiculed constantly, and even had others come down to point and laugh at me. I was scared to go to the bathroom for fear of being made fun of and feeling afraid that the hospital was not going to care for me at all.</p>
<p>My current doctor has said that the surgeon at that hospital hacked me up because they did not care and that it is “mandatory to redo the surgery in my face because that doctor had done such a bad job.”</p>
<p>I live in constant pain everyday in my face but I am also in pain worried about the future.  I am so afraid of getting turned away at another hospital in case of emergency or when needing treatment. I am afraid of being bullied and beaten up again because of being born different. </p>
<p><strong>I am NOT the only one that has been mistreated by hospitals and especially the nursing staff through verbal abuses. </strong></p>
<p>In my case I was very lucky to get treatment at all. The whole time I was there I was made fun of and the doctor did not care about the quality of surgery to my face (shattered bones) because he did not even treat me with dignity as a human with rights.  In Muncie, Indiana (very close to where I live) there is another story that also confirms my experience is part of a larger social problem.  For more information visit “Trans talk” via the following link: </p>

<p><strong>Something has to be done (not just for me) but to ensure that gays, lesbians, and the transgender community will be treated fairly at hospitals and not abused. Even though I am different I am still a human being and deserve to be treated with dignity and with human rights.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please help support my cause and send a message to the world that this will no longer be tolerated! Please help restore my dignity!</strong></p>
<p>I am trying to have female reconstructive surgery so that I can just live the rest of my life without fear of being transgender and I am trying to raise money to have my face reconstructed so that I will not have to live each day in constant pain.</p>
<p>I am asking for help personally because I have not been able to get back on my feet after the crisis from the car accident and after a person in a powerful position conned me out of my property which was my life savings. I was desperate to get the money for the surgery so I was going to lease out my property per the counsel of someone whom I thought I could trust.  I ended up losing everything I had worked for my whole life, on top of the intense pain from the car accident, and was even homeless for a time.  </p>
<p>Please share my story and fight with others <a href=""../../nbloom0415"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.indiegogo.com/nbloom0415</a> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your gift will help restore my dignity to live fully as a whole person and as a woman, and also reduce my fear of social settings and public humiliation. I am also hoping that it has a larger impact to be a voice against the oppression and to stand up for the rights and dignity of the transgender community especially at hospitals where every human should have the right to quality treatment FREE from emotional abuse.  </p></div>","Join me in my fight for dignity!

Every person in America deserves to have human rights and to live with dignity!
Just six years ago, I was in a head-on collision/car accident. The driver was drunk and was not looking where he was going. Almost every bone in my face was shattered. I remember the flashing lights of an ambulance and was taken to the hospital where I was humiliated by the nurses-the whole staff made me a laughing stock.
While there I received the bare minimum of treatment, was ridiculed constantly, and even had others come down to point and laugh at me. I was scared to go to the bathroom for fear of being made fun of and feeling afraid that the hospital was not going to care for me at all.
My current doctor has said that the surgeon at that hospital hacked me up because they did not care and that it is “mandatory to redo the surgery in my face because that doctor had done such a bad job.”
I live in constant pain everyday in my face but I am also in pain worried about the future.  I am so afraid of getting turned away at another hospital in case of emergency or when needing treatment. I am afraid of being bullied and beaten up again because of being born different. 
I am NOT the only one that has been mistreated by hospitals and especially the nursing staff through verbal abuses. 
In my case I was very lucky to get treatment at all. The whole time I was there I was made fun of and the doctor did not care about the quality of surgery to my face (shattered bones) because he did not even treat me with dignity as a human with rights.  In Muncie, Indiana (very close to where I live) there is another story that also confirms my experience is part of a larger social problem.  For more information visit “Trans talk” via the following link: 
http://destrantalk.blogspot.com/2010/07/update-to-transgender-woman-denied.html
or http://www.wishtv.com/dpp/news/local/north_central/transgender-controversy-sparks-change-at-muncie-hospital
Something has to be done (not just for me) but to ensure that gays, lesbians, and the transgender community will be treated fairly at hospitals and not abused. Even though I am different I am still a human being and deserve to be treated with dignity and with human rights.
Please help support my cause and send a message to the world that this will no longer be tolerated! Please help restore my dignity!
I am trying to have female reconstructive surgery so that I can just live the rest of my life without fear of being transgender and I am trying to raise money to have my face reconstructed so that I will not have to live each day in constant pain.
I am asking for help personally because I have not been able to get back on my feet after the crisis from the car accident and after a person in a powerful position conned me out of my property which was my life savings. I was desperate to get the money for the surgery so I was going to lease out my property per the counsel of someone whom I thought I could trust.  I ended up losing everything I had worked for my whole life, on top of the intense pain from the car accident, and was even homeless for a time.  
Please share my story and fight with others http://www.indiegogo.com/nbloom0415 
The Impact
Your gift will help restore my dignity to live fully as a whole person and as a woman, and also reduce my fear of social settings and public humiliation. I am also hoping that it has a larger impact to be a voice against the oppression and to stand up for the rights and dignity of the transgender community especially at hospitals where every human should have the right to quality treatment FREE from emotional abuse.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
The liberty movement has a number of allies in public office but it isn't enough. We need individuals walking the halls of Utah's legislature doing those things that even our best legislators cannot. <br/><br/>Utah's legislature passes an average of 500 bills each 45 day legislative session. They are wasting our money and creating more laws than could possibly be needed to protect our life, liberty and property.<br/><br/>We have a right to petition our government but few of us have the time or the resources to spend our days at the Capitol working to advance our common cause. By pooling our resources, we will be able to hire professionals to represent us and work toward our goals, we can ensure that our voice is truly heard by every lawmaker in Utah. <br/><br/>Finding committed bill sponsors, attending committee meetings, building coalitions and organizing public support/opposition are just a few of the critical functions that can be performed by a well trained, full time liberty advocate. <br/><br/>The vast majority of lobbyists are hired by relatively small, well funded organizations whose interests are promoted at the expense of the rest of us. Ours will be funded by, and accountable to, those of us who want nothing more than a government that respects our lives, liberties and property. <br/><br/>This is the first step in many toward a freer, more prosperous Utah. </div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
The more money we are able to raise, the more professional advocates we can afford to hire. The more representation we have, the greater success we are likely to have in reaching our goals.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
We want all residents of Utah to be free to live, work and play in whatever peaceful way they choose. We do not want smaller government, we want small government. We do not want freer markets, we want free markets. We do not want government planning and regulation of our personal lives, we want the freedom to be responsible for our ownselves.</div>

No, ono što nas svaki put najviše zaboli su predrasude i netočne informacije o najmlađima - djeci rođenoj nakon postupaka medicinski potpomognute oplodnje - a nada nam je da s vremenom takve predrasude nestanu, a čemu će, uvjerene smo, i ova slikovnica pomoći.Naša područja rada u udruzi: Senzibiliziranje javnosti na problem medicinski potpomognute oplodnje, informiranje i educiranje osoba s problemom neplodnosti, pritisak na mjerodavne institucije za proširenje prava pacijenata i pacijentica suočenih s problemom neplodnosti, pritisak na zakonodavce i aktivnosti za mijenjanje i donošenje kvalitetnog Zakona o medicinski potpomognutoj oplodnji, te rješavanje ostalih problema vezanih uz neplodnost. **************Help a Stork Out - Crowdfunding Campaign for MAR (IVF) Families  Since July, a team of volunteers from the Medically Assisted Fertility project at Roda - Parents in Action have been working on first ever storybook on medically assisted fertility in Croatia and the region, written for children who were born after MAR and their friends. The story has been written, and it's time to share it with MAR families and their loved ones.To produce and print 500 copies of The Stork Who Needed Help, a portion of which will be donated to libraries and kindergartens, we need to raise 4850 USD in our Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign.Support our volunteers' hard work by contributing to the campaign to create the first Croatian children's book that describes how MAR babies came into this world to children in a fun and relatable way.When we teach children that there are many ways to become a parent, they understand and accept it early on. In doing this we empower them to deal with challenges they may encounter when discussing MAR with friends. By teaching them that they came into this world in a different, but equally miraculous way, we also teach them that it is ok to be different and to accept the difference we experience in others.This campaign was prepared by Roda's volunteers, BLANK-incubator and Maja Benčić aka Fritula. We are especially proud that Robert Veriga, the first IVF baby in Croatia (and 7th in the world!) is a campaign supporter. The Stork Who Needed Help - a storybook for families who have experienced MAR and their friends! You can help support this project in a number of ways:
Financially, by choosing one of the perks or donating the amount of your choice to the campaign through Indiegogo
By sharing the campaign with MAR families and their loved ones
By sharing the campaign on your own social media channels - every share helps raise awareness about MAR and our storybook
By leaving a supportive comment for our volunteers on the campaign's page

<h3>Who Is Patrick McCollum?<br/>
</h3>
<p>Reverend Patrick McCollum is for now one of the best kept secrets in our world. Very few know that not only is he an interfaith chaplain and Wiccan Priest who carries the knowledge of the ""Old Way,"" he has also been honored by spiritual leaders in many spiritual circles around the world. <br/></p>
<p>Patrick has been named the ""World Inner Peace Ambassador"" by Buddhist spiritual leaders in Thailand. He was an honored guest speaker at the World Culture Forum in Kazakstan 2010 where he spoke to political and spiritual leaders from over 80 countries on the importance of our harmonious connection with Nature and with each other. He has been recognized as a Saint in India and given the name 'Babaji', meaning 'Revered Father.' He has also been honored as the 'King of Peace' by renowned Tibetan Buddhist Rinpoche's in our world. He is known by Native Americans as, ""He Who Speaks With the Mother"" due to his work to secure indigenous sacred sites and his advocacy on behalf of native populations. In 2011 he was honored with receiving the Mahatma Gandhi Award for Religious Pluralism. He hand constructed a violin, which has been declared by the United Nations to be the 'World Peace Violin' and he has been invited to share it at the UN's International Peace Day next fall. Last January, Patrick was invited to lead the opening prayer at the Maha Kumba Mela in India, a spiritual gathering that attracted over 100 million people. <br/></p>
<p>Patrick is quickly becoming one of the foremost voices in our world on the topics of creating world peace and sustaining all people. His message inspires audiences to recognize our inherent interconnection through a common narrative, which gives us greater access to envisioning and creating a common goal: a world that works for everyone. He is changing the world by creating peace bridges between countries and people, inspiring youth, working to support women's rights, and religious equality around the world.</p>
<p><b>What is this opportunity?</b><br/><br/>Sri Tathata, a great spiritual leader in India, has asked Patrick to be one of the primary facilitators at the MahaYaha, a 6-day event of rituals and prayers designed to create world peace. The intention of this ritual is to shift the course and consciousness of our planet. <br/><br/>This is a revival of an ancient and sacred Hindu ritual called the MahaYaga, which is written about in the Vedas and goes back many thousands of years. This ritual was stopped a couple thousand years ago and is only now being re-created.<br/><br/>In addition to facilitating the ritual itself, Patrick has been asked to be a keynote speaker both as an individual and at a round table with some of the foremost religious and political leaders from around the world where the topic is world peace, women's issues and planetary sustainability.</p>
<p>The MahaYaga is expected to draw 4 to 10 million people as well as the BBC, the World Press and many other similar organizations. Learn more here <a href=""http://www.mahayaga.org/mahayaga/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.mahayaga.org/mahayaga/</a><br/></p>
<b>Why are we asking for financial support?</b><br/><br/>While Patrick's service and presence at this powerful event is clearly of high value, the organizers of the MahaYaga do not have the financial means to provide for his airfare or for his team of assistants, security and videography during his stay in India. Our desire is not only to get him there, but to insure his safe travels and maximize the outreach of the important messages he has to share.<br/><br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are aiming to raise $10,800 for this trip. What this would afford us are 4 round-trip tickets to India for Patrick and his support staff at approximately $1800 to $2000 per ticket, and a remaining $2800- $3600 budget to hire security, a translator, a videographer, and have some money for other travel expenses. If we receive more than our funding needs, the extra money will go towards the cost of editing the audio, video and photos that are captures in this trip to make them available to all of you!</p>
<p>Everyone who gives at any level will receive a letter of thanks hand-signed by Patrick McCollum. They will also have their name included in the credits of any digital product made out of this trip, and they will receive a recording of the live conference call where they will be among the first to hear the highlights of the trip.<br/></p>
<p>Everyone who gives $100 or more will have their names included in the credits on any digital product made out of this trip and will be invited to participate in a live conference call with Patrick to hear about the highlights of the trip.<br/></p>

</div>
<p align=""center""><strong>This is a story about people deciding to take action to make sure that governments and that police are accountable to the people in Canada.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p> The Coalition was formed after the police killing of Levi Schaeffer to create a supportive personal and political network of solidarity for the Schaeffer family as they joined forces with the Minty family.  The families asked Ontario’s Courts to look at whether the systemic police actions of lawyer note vetting and joint lawyer retainers pursued as internal policy by the O.P.P. during S.I.U. investigations were -or were not permitted within the law laid out in Police Services Act and legislation regarding police and oversight.  The families won a unanimous decision at Ontario’s highest court in November, 2011.  The decision laid out with great clarity that the police actions in question were not permitted by law and could not be permitted without greatly jeopardizing the legitimacy of investigations, breaching necessary segregation laws and threatening the sanctity of police notes used by police in courts as they appear for the crown as state witnesses.  Unhappy with the decision that they must follow the law, the police are now taking the families to the Supreme Court of Canada. We need support so that we can support by helping to pay off family legal bills and to pay logistical costs involved with going to Supreme Court.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Story</strong></p>
<p><em>Maybe it’s hard to imagine…</em> but Imagine living in a country where police can do anything- even kill you or your loved ones, but do not bear appropriate consequences because they are impune. Imagine living in a country where police can function outside of the laws that bind the common people, outside of the scope of independent oversight or outside the reach of the courts of our justice system.  Imagine, just for a moment, a Canada where police live by special, extrajudicial, internal laws, paid by the public but operating outside the realm of civilian law, much as the military does.</p>
<p><em>Police officers are public employees</em>- paid to serve and protect- to enforce laws, to keep the public peace, and to safeguard against criminality.  They have special responsibilities- such as acting as state witnesses in our courts of law and special rights- such as the right to bear arms and use force- including lethal force- on members of the public. These special rights and responsibilities given to police officers must be subjected to a very high level of oversight, inquiry and transparency to ensure the Canadian public that its police and its justice system are functioning responsibly, accountably and to the standards of a proud democracy.</p>
<p>P<em>erhaps the most important thing police officers do</em> is complete their notes by the end of their shift.   Though this might sound trivial compared to chasing robbers and saving lives- it is an officer’s notes that lay the foundation of evidence, investigation and witnessing as members of the public come into contact with police and are brought through the Canadian justice system.  Legislation and acts related to police make it clear that police notes must be written independently (without consulting with anyone else) and contemporaneously (as soon as possible after an occurrence).</p>
<p>In September 2009, an Ontario family whose son was killed by police that June came to realized the incredible importance of police notes. The director of the Special Investigations Unit, Ontario’s independent police oversight body- revealed that officers involved in the death of Levi Schaeffer completed their notes days after his death and all officers involved in the case submitted notes to the S.I.U. which had been reviewed and vetted by a singular lawyer for the Ontario Provincial Police Association. The Schaeffer family combined efforts with Minty family who also lost their son Douglas to police action and went, with their lawyers to asked Ontario’s courts to interpret the Police Services Act and other relevant legislation and to determine whether police lawyer note vetting was or was not  permitted within the law. </p>
<p>  On November 15<sup>th</sup>, 2011- The Ontario Superior Court of Appeal released its unanimous decision in which it clarified that police officers could, of course, contact their lawyer for general legal advice but that they could not postpone writing their notes or handing them in for the S.I.U. until after their lawyer has checked and approved them.  The decision spelled out that the personal interests of an officer for self protection or protection of another member of the force, or of the force- must be understood as secondary to the sworn duty that an officer has as a public employee and professional state witness. Lawyer vetting of police notes could obstruct the well functioning of all levels of our justice system.</p>
<p> Unsatisfied with the courts decision, police interests now take these matters and these grieving families to the Supreme Court of Canada where police lawyers are prepared to argue that the decision laid out by Ontario’s highest court is ‘unworkable’.</p>
<p> On April 19<sup>th</sup>, 2013  Canada’s highest court will hear arguments and in the months that follow- render a decision- that will establish once and for all whether police in Canada- will be allowed to function from a special law- unfettered by accountability standards, legislation or the will of the public.</p>
<p>It is both absurd and obscene it has been left to the efforts and the pocket books of two Ontario families to insist that enormous systemic problems of impunity and lacking accountability be resolved. They continue, knowing that there can be no justice for their dead, but that there can be justice for the living… if we act fearlessly to insist that we want justice for our communities, not police impunity.</p>

<p><strong>The Fundraising Campaign</strong></p>
<p>Along with lending support to the families and coordinating education and solidarity efforts, the Coalition Justice For Levi exists in order to help raise legal funds.  It is absurd that it has been left to the efforts and to the pocket books of two grieving Ontario families to bring a widespread, systemic, governmental mess to light and to seek firm resolution through the courts.   For many, many long years, the Office of the Attorney General of Ontario, the Special Investigations Unit, police associations, Ontario’s courts and Ontario’s justices have all been embrangled in a dispute and conflict.  Each of the aforementioned parties is funded by taxpayers and each is, in fact, a public employee.  Each of these parties has a substantial budget and each one has an obligation to meet their mandates as funded by the public and to assure the greatest level of transparency, efficiency and accountability possible.  Where the resources and responsibility to address these matters do exist within the mechanism of the state, the cohesive political will necessary to finally and clearly resolve this systemic mess does not. </p>
<p>The Coalition Justice For Levi is helping with fundraising efforts because grieving families should not be forced into the poorhouse as they seek the courts’ assistance to resolve these systemic matters.   The Coalition Justice For Levi is helping to raise legal funds, as well, because the outcomes of this historic court case are of great impact and relevance to the greater public interest.</p>
<p><strong>Who is the Coalition Justice For Levi?</strong></p>
<p>The Coalition Justice for Levi is a small group of family members, friends and community members who have directly lost loved ones to unaccountable police violence with a support circle of grassroots prison, policing and mental health organizers and media activists who work to help ensure not only that this particular story gets out but that it functions as a platform for directly linking problems of systemic police lack of accountability to struggles across communities particularly affected by unaccountable or abusive policing.  </p>
<p>Like so many others killed by police, Levi Schaeffer and Douglas Minty were both men who suffered their whole lives from extreme mental health challenges and the associated poverty, stigmatization and criminalization.  An overwhelming number of police killings relate to low income victims and their adjoining low income families who often spend all savings to bury their dead. And the links between poverty and race and gender and sexuality and ability and age… are all too clear.   The Coalition works to empower an opportunity for the people most directly affected- the mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers and lovers of those killed to lead a struggle to affirm the right of all peoples to insist that legal frameworks exist to ensure police do not have unfettered powers. The long history of police targeting of low income, racialized, stigmatized communities reveals a particular necessity to ensure that it is those very voices receiving support to come together and say NO MORE.</p>
<p><strong>What is this funding for?</strong></p>
<p>The Coalition Justice For Levi is hoping to offer direct logistical needs funding to family members as they go to Ottawa for the Supreme Court of Canada.   We are hoping to relieve the stress of self-funding bus trips, hotel stays, food, in city travel and incidentals for family members by taking on the bill.</p>
<p>All funding, aside from these logistical costs, will go towards helping to pay off a portion of owing and accruing legal bills.  </p>
<p> It has been a long and arduous battle since the deaths of their sons, and the Schaeffer and Minty families have paid dearly.  Help repay them for their efforts and determination by making a donation or by sharing this campaign so that they do not have to bare the costs alone of daring to insist that police be held to account.</p>

The Schaeffer family combined efforts with Minty family who also lost their son Douglas to police action and went, with their lawyers to asked Ontario’s courts to interpret the Police Services Act and other relevant legislation and to determine whether police lawyer note vetting was or was not  permitted within the law. 
  On November 15th, 2011- The Ontario Superior Court of Appeal released its unanimous decision in which it clarified that police officers could, of course, contact their lawyer for general legal advice but that they could not postpone writing their notes or handing them in for the S.I.U. until after their lawyer has checked and approved them.  The decision spelled out that the personal interests of an officer for self protection or protection of another member of the force, or of the force- must be understood as secondary to the sworn duty that an officer has as a public employee and professional state witness. Lawyer vetting of police notes could obstruct the well functioning of all levels of our justice system.
 Unsatisfied with the courts decision, police interests now take these matters and these grieving families to the Supreme Court of Canada where police lawyers are prepared to argue that the decision laid out by Ontario’s highest court is ‘unworkable’.
 On April 19th, 2013  Canada’s highest court will hear arguments and in the months that follow- render a decision- that will establish once and for all whether police in Canada- will be allowed to function from a special law- unfettered by accountability standards, legislation or the will of the public.
It is both absurd and obscene it has been left to the efforts and the pocket books of two Ontario families to insist that enormous systemic problems of impunity and lacking accountability be resolved. They continue, knowing that there can be no justice for their dead, but that there can be justice for the living… if we act fearlessly to insist that we want justice for our communities, not police impunity.
 
JUSTICE FOR LEVI IN THE NEWS!!!!
An article about this case publshed in the Toronto Star, the Calgary Herald and others.
 By: Colin Perkel The Canadian Press, Published on Fri Apr 19  Only two weeks left for our Indiegogo fundraising campaign... Help crowd source a thank you to the families by helping to pay off one small chunk of the legal bills... Let's Stop Police Impunity.




Supreme Court to hear arguments about whether police under investigation can have lawyers vet notes.

Whether police officers under investigation by a civilian watchdog can have a lawyer help them prepare their notes finds its way to the Supreme Court of Canada.



 
The Fundraising Campaign
Along with lending support to the families and coordinating education and solidarity efforts, the Coalition Justice For Levi exists in order to help raise legal funds.  It is absurd that it has been left to the efforts and to the pocket books of two grieving Ontario families to bring a widespread, systemic, governmental mess to light and to seek firm resolution through the courts.   For many, many long years, the Office of the Attorney General of Ontario, the Special Investigations Unit, police associations, Ontario’s courts and Ontario’s justices have all been embrangled in a dispute and conflict.  Each of the aforementioned parties is funded by taxpayers and each is, in fact, a public employee.  Each of these parties has a substantial budget and each one has an obligation to meet their mandates as funded by the public and to assure the greatest level of transparency, efficiency and accountability possible.  Where the resources and responsibility to address these matters do exist within the mechanism of the state, the cohesive political will necessary to finally and clearly resolve this systemic mess does not. 
The Coalition Justice For Levi is helping with fundraising efforts because grieving families should not be forced into the poorhouse as they seek the courts’ assistance to resolve these systemic matters.   The Coalition Justice For Levi is helping to raise legal funds, as well, because the outcomes of this historic court case are of great impact and relevance to the greater public interest.
Who is the Coalition Justice For Levi?
The Coalition Justice for Levi is a small group of family members, friends and community members who have directly lost loved ones to unaccountable police violence with a support circle of grassroots prison, policing and mental health organizers and media activists who work to help ensure not only that this particular story gets out but that it functions as a platform for directly linking problems of systemic police lack of accountability to struggles across communities particularly affected by unaccountable or abusive policing.  
Like so many others killed by police, Levi Schaeffer and Douglas Minty were both men who suffered their whole lives from extreme mental health challenges and the associated poverty, stigmatization and criminalization.  An overwhelming number of police killings relate to low income victims and their adjoining low income families who often spend all savings to bury their dead. And the links between poverty and race and gender and sexuality and ability and age… are all too clear.   The Coalition works to empower an opportunity for the people most directly affected- the mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers and lovers of those killed to lead a struggle to affirm the right of all peoples to insist that legal frameworks exist to ensure police do not have unfettered powers. The long history of police targeting of low income, racialized, stigmatized communities reveals a particular necessity to ensure that it is those very voices receiving support to come together and say NO MORE.
What is this funding for?
The Coalition Justice For Levi is hoping to offer direct logistical needs funding to family members as they go to Ottawa for the Supreme Court of Canada.   We are hoping to relieve the stress of self-funding bus trips, hotel stays, food, in city travel and incidentals for family members by taking on the bill.
All funding, aside from these logistical costs, will go towards helping to pay off a portion of owing and accruing legal bills.  
 It has been a long and arduous battle since the deaths of their sons, and the Schaeffer and Minty families have paid dearly.  Help repay them for their efforts and determination by making a donation or by sharing this campaign so that they do not have to bare the costs alone of daring to insist that police be held to account.

<p align=""center""><strong>BlockChain Development Community and New Cyber Frontier Announce a Public Blockchain to Increase Individual Privacy</strong></p>
<p>The BlockChain Development Community (BCDC), is a group of blockchain experts, cybersecurity experts, computer science experts, mathematicians, PhD researchers, and many other brilliant minds that are collaborating on a new technology breakthrough. We have built solutions for distributed ledger technology that combine many strengths of existing technologies and other platforms. Many of the blockchain platforms that are popular and well-adopted today, have huge weaknesses, and limitations, such as Bitcoin consuming more energy than the entire nation of Switzerland every day. We have built a framework that solves all the current limiting factors that blockchains are facing, and will be facing in the future. This will also enable a marketplace that can range from an average Joe participating from his home computer, all the way to businesses, pre-existing blockchain apps, government uses, and even artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Colorado Senate Bill SB18-086 was signed into law in May 2018, with broad bi-partisan support, to apply blockchain technologies for better security to state records. Since then, more than 220 group members, and 30+ software developers have been building a blockchain/distributed ledger to meet Colorado requirements. It resolves many limiting design issues present on early technology public blockchains, and supports secure, indefinitely-scalable global marketplace.  The platform developed by this effort is now ready for initial public release. </p>
<p>BCDC members have volunteered thousands of hours of development time, often with their own facilities, computers, and money to produce an open platform without large corporate sponsorship.  Now it's time to speed up the delivery process to release  a secure service for individuals' digital privacy rights. Internet users are often the prey for predators and highly funded cyber-attacks from sources such as criminals, hackers, and nation states, which have billions of dollars at their disposal to exploit you. BCDC is seeking $500,000 from crowd-source funding to support the completion of its next development phase. We are seeking funding from the community, in order to support digital privacy rights for everybody.</p>

<p>We are a group of Americans
and Haitian Americans who have lived and worked in Haiti for over 20+ years, and are committed to Haiti becoming a developed nation.  We have seen billions of dollars donated to Haiti over the
years and yet Haiti remains the poorest nation in the western hemisphere. 80% of
Haiti’s people live in poverty and 54% in abject poverty. Our programs provide the training and coaching
essential to formulating and executing projects for community and business
groups that call people forth to committed action. Develop Haiti empowers people to produce extraordinary results and accomplish remarkable leadership skills.</p>
<p>Since January 2012, nearly five-hundred Haitian citizens
have been trained through Develop Haiti’s transformational programs.  This new core of leaders is poised to
start transforming Haiti by taking responsibility for their own lives, their
communities and their country.  They are now providing great leadership in their
communities.</p>
<p>But more trained leaders are
needed.  Our next leadership course in
December, 2013, will train community leaders, business leaders, and government
officials in responsibility, integrity and leadership.</p>
<p>A few of the projects taken on by participants after completing our leadership courses:</p>
<p>One project was formed by a group of 25 women for what
they called commerce.  They met weekly and each week these woman brought
$4.  Each week, one woman got all of this money to do commerce.
 Commerce means they might buy a product in bulk and then resell it in
smaller quantities for a profit.  This was so successful that they have
started new groups for other women and men.  This first group of women
started a tree nursery after someone gave them 1000 bags to plant trees.</p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>June
2011</b>: After 15 years of full time pastoral ministry Mandy and myself (Mike, Coreluv
founders) were in transition, yet we had no idea what God would have us do
next.  While we had been asking God for
direction for over a year; in a Spirit led night of prayer He in turn asked us,
“<i>will you spend your lives defending the orphan</i>” and “<i>do you know the name of
an orphan</i>?”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The
question then became, how do we defend the orphan?  The next day I called a spiritual mentor,
Doug Stringer, where I told him about my breakthrough and asked what he
thought?  Doug was encouraged and said,
“you are a day late, you better get going.” 
He then asked, “are there any places on your mind?” I replied, “I have a
couple places on my heart, one being Haiti.” 
Doug said, “I have a trip scheduled in two weeks, would you like to
go?”  I said, “yes.”</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>June 2011</b>: On that initial trip to the disaster-stricken country of
Haiti, we visited seven orphanages and met with several pastors who were
desperately seeking help in providing for fatherless children. At one of the
orphanages we met <b>MyLove</b>, a beautiful young girl who Mandy and I are in the
process of adopting!  One orphanage that
broke my heart could only provide one meal of a handful of rice a day.  After meeting these children who were
literally fighting for their lives, it became clear God’s mandate to defend the
orphan.  We felt led by the Lord to
partner with our first orphanage in Gonaives, Haiti, that at the time was
struggling to provide for 12 children. 
Since that initial partnership we have leased a home for them and are
now providing the six basic needs for 29 orphans!  We decided to forsake the American Dream and leave our comfortable career in order for <b>Coreluv to be birthed!</b> </p>

match any donations to Coreluv up to $50,000.

to give me 12 acres of land to help further Coreluv’s vision.  After a 30 minute truck ride we found
ourselves on the land of Myan worshiping and giving thanks to God for the

began to dream of all the orphans we could rescue.</p>

Coreluv’s dream is to bring the hope of Jesus
Christ to orphans by partnering with communities and orphanages around the
world to provide 6 basic needs: clean water, proper food, healthcare,
education, job skills and a loving home.


Why do we take orphan
care so seriously? James
1:27 reads, “Pure
and genuine religion in the sight of God the Father means caring for orphans
and widows.”  We believe this scripture is not merely a
suggestion but a commandment; something the Church must rise up and do.  Unless someone defends the orphan, they
are defenseless.  Unless someone
speaks for them they will not be heard. 
We choose to defend them, speak for them, and challenge others to do the
same.

See more: CNN / PBS / NBC / CBSThe solution is simple and inexpensive. Cultivator's Water Distribution system is based on 5-gallon ""Jerrycan"" water purifiers. Distribution can start immediately. Water carriers go to a site of fresh water, fill the cans and deliver to different sites, exchanging cans there. The cans can be transported by bike, car, or on foot.Cultivator Project ManagementCultivator has partnered with the Foundation for Puerto Rico for local distribution efforts. The distribution network:
Prioritizes Distribution
Distributes Jerrycan water purification systems
Registers and tracks units for distribution to locations of most urgent need
Retrieves and redistributes units
Return on investmentA person uses about 6 liters of water per day to drink and cook. Each unit purifies 15,000 liters of water. 5,000 units would produce 75MM liters, supplying 50,000 people with 6 liters/day for 250 days.Units cost $200 with shipping and local delivery. Therefore a liter of pure water costs only $0.0125.vs Bottled Water

BOTTLED WATER - Estimated at $0.25 per liter, x 15MM liters = $3,750,000


JERRYCANS - Delivered, distributed and re-usable, x 15MM liters = $200,000

Budget Estimate
Jerrycan landed cost - $145.00
Distribution cost - $55.00
Total per unit- $200.00

1,000 UNITS // 15MM LITERS // COST $200k
2,000 UNITS // 30MM LITERS // COST $400k 
3,000 UNITS // 45MM LITERS // COST $600k

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As three University of Tennessee students, we all did not have a ton of background knowledge about this issue in Knoxville. Only one of us had ever even been to the Volunteer Ministry Center before our first tour. Yet, it was clear from the very beginning why this campaign is so important. </p>
<p>Homelessness is a major problem in the Knoxville community. Let me help illustrate just how large of a problem it is:</p>
<p>Picture this. On your average college football Saturday, around 9,000 Tennessee students file into the friendly confines of Neyland Stadium. Combined, they fill sections D, E, F, H, I, J, and K. This is certainly a large crowd, right?</p>
<p>For each student in this scenario, there has been a corresponding homeless person in Knoxville in the past year.</p>
<p>Each of these people has a chance to escape this cycle and achieve housing. The first step in that process is getting the identification they need. That's where you come in.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to raise $1,000 for the Volunteer Ministry Center, and all of this money will go straight to our goal of providing identification for homeless persons. It is difficult to estimate how many people this would impact, as the cost varies from state to state. </p>
<p>While we may not know how many people this will end up helping, the chance to help one person get off the street is more than enough. Getting one person off of the street and into housing means that they have a chance at achieving employment. That can lead to opportunities that would've never been available to them previously. </p>
<p>One day, they may be able to pay it forward. </p>
<p>Our goal here doesn't end with these $1,000. Our goal is to create lifelong change for people, from those who donate to those who are impacted by the donations. </p>
<p>As far as short-term, we have perks for those who donate!</p>
<p>For all of those who donate more than $10, they will receive a shoutout on our Twitter account! @IDandGratify</p>
<p>The first two people who donate $25 or more will be eligible to receive a $10 Starbucks gift card if they claim one!</p>
<p>The first person to donate $50 or more will receive a surprise package if they choose to claim it!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It is difficult to know exactly how many people we will help. In that way, it seems difficult to understand the scope of this campaign. Even we struggle with that. </p>
<p>There are times when it feels like you are just pushing against the weight of the world and there's nothing you can do. That's how it has felt with this campaign at times, considering the scope of the problem all around us. </p>
<p>Every journey begins with one single step. This is the first step, but it is not the last. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you cannot donate, that is totally okay! Please head over to vmcinc.org and check our their website to look for other ways to give, such as giving your time! </p>

</p><p>Long story short, I ended up in
Haiti for two weeks over Christmas Break partnering with Haiti Outreach Ministries
(HOM) in Port-au-Prince. I expected to love it, but I had no idea that I would
leave half of my heart in a third world country when I flew back to the states
on January 18. I immediately began strategizing about when I could possibly go
back, but had no idea that the opportunity would come so soon. I’ve prayerfully
made the decision to lead a team of anyone who was willing to go over spring
break and am thrilled out of my mind to be returning to the people and the country
that I fell in love with in such a short amount of time. Crazy trust exercise
on my end, but I have faith that the Lord will prepare the way for this time
and provide what we need. </p>
<p>While I was there in January, I had
the opportunity to teach clean water classes to adults in the community and
children in one of the schools at HOM. Additionally, I helped a team that was
there while I was to build a house and helped organize a new library for one of
the elementary schools. When I return over spring break, we will be doing
smaller construction work and painting and art projects with the elementary
students. The students all attend school for free through a sponsorship program
and receive an incredible education because of their sponsors, but have few
opportunities for art and other hands-on activities because of a lack of
supplies. </p>
<p>We are raising funds for all of
these projects, both construction and crafts, and would be grateful for any
donation you can offer. The smallest amount truly makes a difference. These
donations can be money or art supplies, and will go directly to the
construction work and the art projects we will be doing during our trip. While
this trip cannot happen without the necessary funds, it also cannot happen
without your prayers. Please pray that the Lord works in incredible and
unimaginable ways and that everything would come together as He has planned.
Pray for each individual on our team and each individual that we encounter in
Port-au-Prince and for the relationships we will build. Finally, please pray
for our hearts; that we would serve, but more than anything, that we would bow
down at Jesus’ feet and listen to what he will teach us. [Luke 10:38-42] If you

<h3>Our Story</h3>

a Graduate Student at NYU pursuing a Master’s Degree in Global Affairs with a
concentration in International Law and Human Rights. This winter I have the
opportunity to work with two amazing organizations for three weeks in Kigali, Rwanda. Through
Global Youth Connect, an NGO, I will be participating in a Young Leaders Human
Rights Delegation. Along with other international representatives I will work
in collaboration with Rwandan young adults to raise awareness of and advocate
for Human Rights, both regionally and globally. We will be presenting and
discussing our work with governmental officials and international organizations
with the intention of engaging those “big players” to enact real policy change. (Available upon request is a letter of support from the Executive Director of CYG to authentic these statements)</p>
<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style="""">            </span>My
personal area of interest is in Women’s Health and Reproductive Rights. I will
be partnering with a local health advocacy NGO named Health Development
Initiative, which coincidently was started by a past participant of the Young

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Advocacy work, changing laws and cultural attitudes is not overnight work. I will not pretend to promise you that by January I will have accomplished any of these. However, I will work tirelessly while I am there to have an impact on HDI as an organization and help them make strides towards reaching their goals. I will apply my skills and background into promotion, module writing, education campaigns, legislative re-writes or any work they ask of me. I will broaden their network and continue to promote their work after my return. What I can guarantee you is that this experience will have an impact on me and my future work. My academic studies need to be applied, otherwise I am a theorist not an activist. No matter how informative my graduate program is I cannot achieve the level of expertise that I aspire to without working with women, NGOs, international organization, governments and opposing parties. This work in Rwanda will shape me as an advocate and practitioner. </p>

</div></div>","Our Story


            Did you watch the video? If so here are those details I promised you. I am currently
a Graduate Student at NYU pursuing a Master’s Degree in Global Affairs with a
concentration in International Law and Human Rights. This winter I have the
opportunity to work with two amazing organizations for three weeks in Kigali, Rwanda. Through
Global Youth Connect, an NGO, I will be participating in a Young Leaders Human
Rights Delegation. Along with other international representatives I will work
in collaboration with Rwandan young adults to raise awareness of and advocate
for Human Rights, both regionally and globally. We will be presenting and
discussing our work with governmental officials and international organizations
with the intention of engaging those “big players” to enact real policy change. (Available upon request is a letter of support from the Executive Director of CYG to authentic these statements)
            My
personal area of interest is in Women’s Health and Reproductive Rights. I will
be partnering with a local health advocacy NGO named Health Development
Initiative, which coincidently was started by a past participant of the Young
Leaders Delegation. They currently have several campaigns that I cannot wait to
get involved with including improving the current family-planning situation in
Rwanda.  In the world of Human
Rights, Reproductive Rights can be a hard torch to carry. There are no
anti-ending-world-hunger campaigns or organizations that promote the
continuation of genocide. Unfortunately, there are powerful forces at work to
prevent women from having access to all the available options to protect their
bodies and their lives. Contrary to the opposition’s assertions that
Reproductive Rights advocates are only concerned with promoting and increasing
abortion I am interested in ending the unsafe, unregulated and illegal
operations that are happening everyday worldwide by protecting every woman’s
sexual sovereignty. How? In part, by decriminalizing abortions but also by promoting
female education, increasing male and female contraceptive use, financially
empowering women, ending sex trafficking, ending preventable maternal mortality,
persecuting and convicting every genre of rapist and sexually based war
criminal...for the sake of time I’ll end there but the list of applicable actions
is endless. 
            So
why do I need you? There is the temptation to ask, “Aren’t you lucky, Colleen?
You get to travel to Rwanda AND you want my help doing it?” Yes, the answer is
yes. I am incredibly lucky to be pursuing my passion; but like just every

What I Need & What You Get
If you haven't already checked them out, my ""purchase perks"" are conveniently located on the right side of your screen. These are meant to involve you in this campaign since your contributions are so vital to its existence.

Where do your contributions go?
Delegation Tuition: $2,250
                                  -3 weeks of housing and transportation in Rwanda
                                  -All training sessions

This cost I have no control over. Yes, it's pricey but without GYC, I wouldn't have this opportunity. GYC offers one tuition discount based on submitted essays and I will let every know if I am awarded the discount of $200.

Airfare: $1789 (at last check)
                                   -on Lufthansa. It was the cheapest that I could find.

Full Travel insurance: $139

This already adds up to over $4000, not to mention other costs that are bound to come up, like malaria pills for instance. I am only asking to raise $4000 because it is reasonable and achievable if I market my campaign very well. Indiegogo allows me to raise above my allotted amount in the time I have set.

<p><b>Solution</b><br/></p>
<p>Pool resources as a city to purchase &amp; donate sleeping
bags to be distributed through key non-profit partnerships and volunteer groups.</p>
<b>Origins</b><p></p>
<p>Sleepless in Seattle is the brainchild of a few Seattleites who simply asked the question, ""how can we care for our community?"" People from every socioeconomic, religious, and cultural background are invited to participate in this movement.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>While Sleepless in Seattle is not exclusively affiliated with any one organization, donations will be processed through an existing 501(c)(3) non-profit Urban Hands which provides donated meals around the Seattle area.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>
<p><b>Do people who are homeless need sleeping bags?</b></p>
<p>Yes. The Sleepless in Seattle team has reached out to over a dozen local non-profits  who work with homeless populations to assess the need. These non-profits have responded with an assessment of significant need with one non-profit estimating that 80% of the homeless on the streets do not have access to sleeping bags.</p>
<p><i>Seattle has more homeless folks than shelters.  Sleeping outside is the only option for some, meaning that a sleeping bag is a life-changing gift.  The gift of sleep is the single most important way to communicate you care. </i></p>
<p>-Kristine Cunningham, Executive Director of ROOTS Young Adult Homeless Shelter</p>
<p><i>The unfortunate reality is that we do not have the capacity to house all of the homeless youth in our community. Having resources, like sleeping bags, is critical to helping them survive the night and starts the conversation with staff help move young people forward and off the streets.</i></p>
<p>-Melinda Giovengo, PhD, Executive Director of Youth Care</p>
</div>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>How You Can Help</h3> <p><b>Donate to Sleepless in Seattle</b></p>
<p>100% of funds will be used to purchase sleeping bags for the homeless in Seattle &amp; King County. Crowdsourcing and credit card transaction costs, will be covered by generous supporters. All Sleepless in Seattle coordinating efforts are purely volunteer-based.  </p>
<p></p>
<p>$10,000 = 500 sleeping bags</p>
<p>$50,000 = 2,500 sleeping bags</p>
<p>$75,000 =  3,750 sleeping bags - enough to cover the  homeless population in King County</p>
<p><i>How will funds be used?</i></p>
<p>Collected funds will be used to purchase sleeping bags in bulk from online wholesale distributors. Sleeping bags of
varying styles and sizes will be purchased at a price range in order to
accommodate varying needs. Some prefer warmer, larger bags while others prefer
smaller bags that can be carried and concealed easily in a backpack. </p>
<p><i>What's in it for me?</i></p>
<p>For once, let's <i>do something</i>, simply because it's <i>something worth doing</i>.<br/></p>

<p>Yes. Donors can expect to receive an email from payment processor FirstGiving with a tax-deductible receipt from the non-profit <a href=""http://www.theuppercrustcatering.com/#!urban-hands/cff1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.theuppercrustcatering.com/#!urban-hands/cff1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Urban Hands</a>.

Vision
A Seattle and King County where every homeless individual
has a warm sleeping bag to get them through the winter and beyond.
Problem
On any given winter night, at least 3,100 people in King County
sleep directly on the streets bearing with temperatures in the 20s and 30s. This year, let’s do something about it. 
Solution
Pool resources as a city to purchase & donate sleeping
bags to be distributed through key non-profit partnerships and volunteer groups.
Origins
Sleepless in Seattle is the brainchild of a few Seattleites who simply asked the question, ""how can we care for our community?"" People from every socioeconomic, religious, and cultural background are invited to participate in this movement.  

While Sleepless in Seattle is not exclusively affiliated with any one organization, donations will be processed through an existing 501(c)(3) non-profit Urban Hands which provides donated meals around the Seattle area.


The Impact

Do people who are homeless need sleeping bags?
Yes. The Sleepless in Seattle team has reached out to over a dozen local non-profits  who work with homeless populations to assess the need. These non-profits have responded with an assessment of significant need with one non-profit estimating that 80% of the homeless on the streets do not have access to sleeping bags.
Seattle has more homeless folks than shelters.  Sleeping outside is the only option for some, meaning that a sleeping bag is a life-changing gift.  The gift of sleep is the single most important way to communicate you care. 
-Kristine Cunningham, Executive Director of ROOTS Young Adult Homeless Shelter
The unfortunate reality is that we do not have the capacity to house all of the homeless youth in our community. Having resources, like sleeping bags, is critical to helping them survive the night and starts the conversation with staff help move young people forward and off the streets.
-Melinda Giovengo, PhD, Executive Director of Youth Care

<p>We're not even halfway through our 6 month pilot program, and we've already given over 500 showers!</p>
<p>Our most surprising findings? </p>
<p>1. A huge proportion of our guests have jobs, families, and degrees, and, 
like so many of us, were just one unfortunate incident away from 
homelessness.  </p>
<p>2. The power of a shower.  After just 15 minutes, 
we see people emerge with big smiles, new attitudes, and most humbling 
of all, gratitude. </p>
<p>3. We're touching more lives than we expected.  From our volunteers, to passersby on the street, to those reading about us on the Internet across the world, Lava Mae is reconnecting many more than just the homeless to our shared humanity. <br/></p>
<p>Here are a few stories:</p>
<ul style=""font-weight: bold;"">
<li>Monte, a machinist from Detroit, moved to San Francisco in search 
for a job.  Unable to afford rent without opportunities for work, he's 
been living on the streets for the last few months.  After a local TV 
broadcast aired an interview with him about our service, Lava Mae 
received an email from an employee at Tesla who saw his story and wants 
to connect him to employment.</li>
<li>Emily and her family of five visit us every Saturday morning.
  The parents work, and their three children are in school.  With the 
addition of Lava Mae's Saturday stop, they are now able to take 2 
showers per week. Limited shower availability in San Francisco is even 
more challenging for young families who don't want to put their children at risk 
in unsafe environments that lack privacy and supervision.</li>
<li><p><b>Homeless for one-year, Silas (below) is a charming, middle-aged man who 
is dying of liver cancer. Being clean is vital to him, especially as his
 medication makes his skin sensitive and prone to sores.  He says that 
Lava Mae is helping to keep him healthy, and is the bright spot in his 
weekend.</b></p></li>

</div><br/></div>","Lava 
Mae, a San Francisco-based mobile shower and sanitation service for the 
homeless, is at it again.   We ran a very successful IndieGoGo campaign 
last year that raised funds to retrofit our first mobile hygiene bus.It
 wasn't corporate dollars, it wasn't a wealthy philanthropist that made 
that possible.  It was a community of IndieGoGo supporters - like you - 
that brought our bus to life.   And we're asking you to help us do it 
again!Help us raise $75,000* for a second bus, and we'll be able to give 25,000 showers next year!       
We convert retired public transportation buses into bathrooms on wheels because we believe that for the thousands of men, women, and children living on our streets, a shower can be the first step towards transformation.
""If you're homeless, living on the streets and filthy, you're trying to improve your circumstances, but you can't interview for a job, you can't apply for housing and you become disconnected from your humanity. So a shower, just in itself, can be amazing for people.""
                                                                                   ~Doniece Sandoval, founder, Lava Mae

There are 7,350+ people without homes in San Francisco. 
 Over half live on the street yet there are only 7 places where they can
 drop in to take a shower.

It's not just San Francisco 
that has this problem.  Communities across this country are failing to 
provide access to hygiene for their citizens.  We hear from someone just
 about every day in some city or town in the US who asks us to bring Lava
 Mae to their community.  The need is huge.








""I've been trying to take a shower for two weeks, and I finally got in here today. To be able to take a shower at least once or twice a week is probably the best thing ever. This makes it a lot more convenient. You just have no idea how serious this is for a person to be able to wash themselves. At least that much dignity.""  ~ Windell R. 
Our first bus launched at the end of June 2014, and it's already a huge success. We've given over 500 showers to lots of people like Windell, and this is just the beginning.  With a second bus, we can provide 25,000 showers in 2015.




We
 need $75,000 to retrofit Bus 2 and create more mobile showers and 
toilets for the thousands of men, women and children who so desperately 
need them.  Join us; become part of the ""village"" that's making this 
imaginative and innovative dream possible - one shower (bus) at a time. 


To thank you for helping us realize this dream, here are the great perks we've put together:

<br/><h3><i>What We Need From You</i></h3> <h4><br/></h4>
<h4>Through this Indiegogo campaign, we have <span style=""font-size: 30px; letter-spacing: 1px; line-height: 38px;"">two main goals </span>we plan to achieve if we reach our minimum funding: </h4>
<h4><ol>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Complete the design and development of the Jujitio mobile app and website and support initial streaming software licensing</span></li>
<li><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Build a community of Jujitio Justices who are committed to ending police brutality and abuses of power</span></li>
</ol></h4>
<div><br/></div>
<div>We know this is an issue a lot of people are passionate about, and we believe we have a great solution and a great team to launch it. If we are fortunate enough to receive your support and <span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">funding beyond our minimum goal, </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">we plan to use these funds to:</span>
</div>
<div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></div>
<ol>
<li>Support our first few months of operating costs, especially web hosting and software license fees, while we build the critical mass of Users to support the application once we turn it over to a non-profit group to operate (see $500 Perk)<br/>
</li>
<li>Recruit Users</li>
<li>Raise awareness and blog about the prevalence of excessive force and other police 
misconduct and the rights and responsibilities of citizens in a free 
society to record police</li>
</ol>
</div> <div> <h3><i><br/></i></h3>
<div>
<i><h3><i>If we don't reach our funding goal </i></h3></i><p><b><br/></b></p>

<p>At the same time, we want <i><b>to make sure we are able to do something even in the event that we do not reach our goal</b> </i>to bring more attention to this problem. That's why, if we do not reach our goal, <b>we will still use the funds we receive to develop a website dedicated to exposing police misconduct by disseminating video recordings and writing about the problem on our blog.</b> You can see our <a href=""http://jujitio.us/police-misconduct-blotter/after-ferguson-can-we-all.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">first substantive blog post here</a> to get an idea of what we have in mind.</p>

</div></div>","Jujitio is a website dedicated to harnessing the power of mobile technology to raise public awareness about excessive force and police misconduct and improve police and community relations.



The Jujitio app enables Users to protect their civil rights and safely and securely record and share video of police misconduct and excessive force.




Users record their interactions with law enforcement using our mobile app 
Recordings are instantly streamed to our servers rather than stored on the device.

The recording is available to the User to download, publish, delete, or report, and after a while, it's available to their Trusted Contacts too.

The User or one of their Trusted Contacts may publish the recording, making it publicly available for viewing on our website.

The recording is never stored on the User's device unless the User downloads it, protecting them from the possibility that police will destroy the recording or use it as evidence against them.



No matter how much we receive from this campaign, all funds will help us protect civil rights and liberties by enabling us to build the website, expose and write about video recordings and incidents of excessive force and police misconduct, and raise awareness about these problems in our nation's law enforcement culture. 

If we do reach our funding goal, we'll also be able to begin building the app and make it available for free early next year.

The Detailed Explanation of the App




A more detailed explanation of Jujitio. Pretty much tells you everything you'd want to know about the campaign.
Police misconduct and excessive force have become far too common.

Americans file as many as 27,000 complaints a year against police for using excessive force. These incidents cost states and cities billions of dollars, not to mention the damage they do to police and community relations. They also mean that many for many Americans, civil rights are still just an unfulfilled promise.




Out of the half million people police threaten or use force against each year, 60% are never arrested or charged with a crime. And 15% were actually getting ""help"" from the police!

And on top of that, in recent years police have used civil asset seizure laws to wrongfully take millions of dollars from people who have never been charged with a crime using it to buy things elected officials won't put in the budget, like armored cars and $300 coffee machines. A large portion of the seized funds are used to buy military equipment that make police forces look and act more like military occupiers than fellow citizens.


Police
 agencies have used hundreds of millions of dollars taken from Americans
 under federal civil forfeiture law in recent years to buy guns, armored
 cars and electronic surveillance gear. They have also spent money on 
luxury vehicles, travel and a clown named Sparkles. -Washington Post special report on civil asset seizure

When you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion 
of civil liberties and due process  . . . we begin to have a very 
serious problem on our hands. - U.S. Senator Rand Paul, writing in Time magazine.

And let's be honest, if a cop steps out of line, and it's your word against theirs, a lot of people will accept an officer's version of events. That's why video and photos can be such important and powerful evidence when police use excessive force or abuse their power.

Recording the police offers you some protection, but what if an officer stops or confiscates your recording or your device gets damaged?


With the Jujitio app, you can record the police with confidence, knowing only you can access your recordings and decide who sees them. 



And if the police step out of line, you know you can turn to a powerful online community committed to telling your story and getting justice for you.
 




It all starts with the Jujitio mobile app and the four R's of our patent pending process



Record

Jujitio Users record and photograph their interactions with police using our mobile app. Instead of getting stored on their device, the recording or photo streams directly to our servers, where it's securely stored and available only to the User and their Trusted Contacts.





Record the police and stream it directly to our cloud-based servers.
Review


After recording or photographing the police, the User will have up to 6 hours, depending on their settings, to log on to our website or through a password protected portal in the mobile app to review their recording or photo. 


At that time, the User will have the option to download, delete, or publish the recording or photo or report the incident to the civil rights authorities at the U.S. Department of Justice. They can also choose to add details such as the police unit, badge number, and names of any officers involved and written details about their recollection of the incident. 


If the User does not delete the recording during this initial 6-hour period, an email alert will go out to the User's Trusted Contacts informing them about the recording and their opportunity to download, delete, or publish it at Jujitio.com or report it to the authorities.

Only the User, and later their Trusted Contacts, will have access to the recording. The idea is that if you are injured or arrested so that you cannot make a decision about the recording, your Trusted Contacts have your best interest at heart and will know whether you would want them to download, delete, or publish the recording or report the incident to authorities. 


Access to unpublished recordings is password protected so only the User and Trusted Contacts can get in. And if nobody does anything, the recording or photograph will automatically delete from our servers after 96 hours. 
Ridicule 
Publicizing and ridiculing police misconduct and excessive force will deter some officers from abusing their power in the first place and provide an opportunity to get some measure of accountability and justice for victims even when the law fails.
If a User reviews their recording or photo and decides it shows police misconduct or excessive force, the User may choose to publish the recording on our  website, allowing visitors to the site to view, share, rate, and comment on the recording.  
Recordings with higher ratings will be prioritized for other visitors to the site to view and review, and discussion boards on each recording's page will allow visitors to the website to comment on the conduct in the videos.
Report
Users and their Trusted Contacts will have an option to report an incident to the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Justice if they believe their civil rights have been violated by a police officer. Before sending the recording or photo, Users will have an opportunity to add details about the incident that may help authorities investigate and prosecute the officers involved. We also provide an option for Users to 
include or exclude time and location information when they record with the Jujitio app, allowing them to decide how much documentation is available if they need to report an incident.
Privacy and Security



Privacy and security are essential to ensure a person's recording can't be destroyed by an officer or used to embarrass or even prosecute them. 

We protect Users' privacy in four important ways:
Recordings and photos taken with the app are streamed directly to our servers, so there's nothing on the User's device if it gets taken away or lost. 
If a User isn't available to make a decision about whether to download, delete or publish their recording or report a violation of their rights to authorities, only the User’s Trusted Contacts get access to the recording to ensure someone the User trusts sees what happened and can make an informed decision on their behalf.
If nobody does anything, recordings and photos are automatically deleted from our servers 96 hours after we receive them.

Finally, Jujitio never gets any information about our Users other than their email address and password and email addresses for their Trusted Contacts. 


We Love Good Cops
The vast majority of complaints for excessive force are made against a very small number of officers and even many of these are unsubstantiated, because most police officers are great public servants. It is the very few who abuse their power to bully and injure citizens or steal their property who make it impossible for people in some communities to trust the police. At Jujitio, we hope to make it safer and easier for the great cops out there to do their job by making it harder for bad cops to get away with doing rotten things to the people they police and protect. 
   
Our Team


Mark O'Brien is a Senior Criminal Justice Policy Associate 
in Legal Action Center's Washington, D.C. office, where he works to reform the criminal justice system and promote health responses to drug use. He is  also the co-chair of the Justice Roundtable's Reentry Working Group.

Chris Lindsey brings over 7 years of marketing and advertising experience to the Jujitio team. Recently, he's been working at Facebook where he specializes in partnering with app developers to help them find users interested in their products.

Pace Putland is a Senior Designer for TJP Engineering in San Diego. Specializing in world class Zoo’s, Aquariums, and Marine parks, Pace coordinates and collaborates with a variety of disciplines on many aspects of design, bringing a unique ability to integrate visual appeal with practical functions. He recently completed work on the Baltimore Zoo's new penguin display.

Each of our team members has a proven track record of success in their respective field and a reputation for getting the job done. Friends since we were teenagers, we have always bonded over completing projects together, most recently focusing our energies on joint web development efforts.  We are passionate about this project, and we also genuinely enjoy the opportunity to work together. 
What We Need From You 
Through this Indiegogo campaign, we have two main goals we plan to achieve if we reach our minimum funding: 

Complete the design and development of the Jujitio mobile app and website and support initial streaming software licensing
Build a community of Jujitio Justices who are committed to ending police brutality and abuses of power


We know this is an issue a lot of people are passionate about, and we believe we have a great solution and a great team to launch it. If we are fortunate enough to receive your support and funding beyond our minimum goal, we plan to use these funds to:



Support our first few months of operating costs, especially web hosting and software license fees, while we build the critical mass of Users to support the application once we turn it over to a non-profit group to operate (see $500 Perk)

Recruit Users
Raise awareness and blog about the prevalence of excessive force and other police 
misconduct and the rights and responsibilities of citizens in a free 
society to record police

  

If we don't reach our funding goal 
We've set this campaign to flexible funding, but we need to reach our minimum goal if we want to be able to build the Jujitio app and ensure we can deliver the high quality and reliable product people need to be able to count on in the often tense situation when they encounter an officer. 
At the same time, we want to make sure we are able to do something even in the event that we do not reach our goal to bring more attention to this problem. That's why, if we do not reach our goal, we will still use the funds we receive to develop a website dedicated to exposing police misconduct by disseminating video recordings and writing about the problem on our blog. You can see our first substantive blog post here to get an idea of what we have in mind.


The Impact 
At Jujitio, we believe trust in law enforcement is critical to keeping communities safe and thriving. Every incident of excessive force and police misconduct erodes the trust necessary for police and communities to work together to achieve a better quality of life for all. Reducing the frequency of these events by holding the perpetrators accountable and informing the public about their behavior is the only way to restore the public confidence that is vital to successful law enforcement. 
By supporting us, you'll not only make possible the creation of a powerful tool for holding officers accountable, you will also make a statement that you are fed up with police misconduct and you aren't going to take it anymore.
  
Other Ways You Can Help

We understand that not everybody has the resources to contribute financially to this campaign. We want you to be a part of making Jujitio a reality and especially to be a part of the community of justice-minded people we want to create on our website. Here's how you can get involved.



Let your friends and family know about what we're doing and direct them to this campaign to learn more about Jujitio and possibly contribute.
Use the Indiegogo share tools on this campaign page to get the word out.

Like us on Facebook so we can let you know when the app is ready for you to download and start recording the police.


Risks & Challenges 
Our team has previously worked together on other projects, including bringing a web app from conception to reality, and we know there are challenges to any development project. 

Challenge: Finding the right people to work on the development of the website and app. We have a team of freelancers in place who we know meet deadlines and deliver quality work from previous projects we've worked on together. We are excited to work with them again on Jujitio.

Challenge: Getting potential Users to download and try the app and website. We will use social media and our blog (the Police Misconduct Blotter) to engage in the highlight this issue and our solution and also promote our idea with contacts we have who may be interested in using the app and sharing it with others. 

Challenge: Anticipating web hosting and licensing costs. Since we will be hosting a potentially large volume of recordings, we are prepared to deal with this challenge in two ways:

<p>Video of the incident obtained by The Daily Caller shows officers defending their behavior to Grisham while restraining him.</p>
<p>“In this day and age, [people] are alarmed when they see someone with what you have,” one of the officers tells Grisham in the video. “They don’t care what the law is.”</p>
<p>Grisham, who is stationed at Fort Hood, was arrested in his hometown of Temple, Texas, east of the base, after police stopped him for carrying an unconcealed rifle slung over his shoulder. Texas is a right-to-carry state, and law-abiding gun permit owners can carry rifles and hunting weapons openly, so long as the weapons are not being carried in a threatening way.</p>
<p>But one of the Temple police officers told Grisham that anyone holding a gun is considered dangerous, according to the video.</p>
<p>“When you alarm people, and they call us,” one of the officers in the video begins to say, after Grisham asks why the officiers failed to ask for his concealed-carry permit.</p>
<p>“And did you explain to them what the law is, sir?” Grisham asks.</p>
<p>“They don’t care what the law is,” the officer replies. Grisham then shoots back, “Do you care what the law is?”</p>

</div></div>","Just a reminder for all my donors that I am writing updates as I have them on my blog, A Soldier's Perspective.   I wanted to take a quick moment and provide an update here in the hopes everyone left an email address and will get this update.
Currently, we are in a holding patter.  The city has still not given up the dashcam footage to my attorney who requested it weeks ago.  This reeks of cover-up to me.  We anticipate the charges will be dropped soon - something that should have been done long ago.  
I have retained attorney Brett Pritchard in Killeen to handle the civil case against the officers, police department, and city.  Kurt Glass is still handling my criminal case.  I have also hired a very good private investigator and expert witness on police procedure.  He has over 19 years of service in various roles of law enforcement, but I don't want to release his name yet.  
If there is any money left over from this campaign, it will go into either a trust to help other local Soldiers dealing with being illegally disarmed or sent to a gun rights group like Gun Owners of America or Texas State Rifle Association.
Again, thank you for your support.

UPDATE3 (12 April 2013: Clips from the video my son took of the incident were released and the Daily Caller has them up on their site.
Video of the incident obtained by The Daily Caller shows officers defending their behavior to Grisham while restraining him.
“In this day and age, [people] are alarmed when they see someone with what you have,” one of the officers tells Grisham in the video. “They don’t care what the law is.”
Grisham, who is stationed at Fort Hood, was arrested in his hometown of Temple, Texas, east of the base, after police stopped him for carrying an unconcealed rifle slung over his shoulder. Texas is a right-to-carry state, and law-abiding gun permit owners can carry rifles and hunting weapons openly, so long as the weapons are not being carried in a threatening way.
But one of the Temple police officers told Grisham that anyone holding a gun is considered dangerous, according to the video.
“When you alarm people, and they call us,” one of the officers in the video begins to say, after Grisham asks why the officiers failed to ask for his concealed-carry permit.
“And did you explain to them what the law is, sir?” Grisham asks.
“They don’t care what the law is,” the officer replies. Grisham then shoots back, “Do you care what the law is?”

Charge reduced against man hiking with gun in Temple

I want to help 300 million people evolve one level closer to 
understanding and appreciating their liberty and innate equality with 
every other human being on this planet. I call this project Op Common 
Sense.<br/><br/>We are creating a series of 18 gorgeous liberty-oriented pamphlets (see the first one below). We will then distribute these pamphlets across the country. We expect to distribute up to 16,000 pamphlets per week in as many as 100 American cities, giving us a potential reach of 1.6 million Americans and a total distribution of as many as 30 million eye-catching slices of liberty.<br/><br/><br/><h2>When</h2>July through October, 2011.<br/><br/><br/><h2>Where</h2>America, you know, that country with 50 states.<br/><br/><br/><h2>Why</h2>Times are desperate. This country is falling apart. We've got wars, inflation, unemployment, domestic oppression, loss of privacy and dignity, disrespect for human rights and rising poverty. The liberty message is not getting out there and it shows every time you have a discussion with a non-libertarian. We have a historic opportunity to right this, to foster a liberty-sensitive populace. Together we can roll all of this back and create space for human freedom.<br/><br/><h2>How</h2>We're trading some really unique and valuable perks in return for the cost of producing the copyright-free pamphlets. Distributors in cities across the country can sell the 3 ad spaces on the pamphlets in order to fund their printing and other expenses. For example, a local liberty group in your area could sell the two bigger ads for $400 each per week. You could spend $500 to buy roughly 10,000 pamphlets and, with the remaining $300 per week, hire someone to hand them out.<br/><br/><br/><h2>Draft First Pamphlet</h2>This is a draft of our first pamphlet.<br/><br/><img align=""none"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://missionliberty.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/p1front-580w.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><br/><img align=""none"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://missionliberty.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/p1back-580.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><p>Hi-res <a href=""http://missionliberty.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/p1front.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">front</a> and <a href=""http://missionliberty.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/p1back.jpg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title="""">back</a><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">.<br/></span></p><p><br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;""></span></p><h2>Where's the Money Going?<img align=""right"" alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://missionliberty.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/julian-300w.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>

</h3>We need to grasp our unique opportunity to put truth in the hands of millions of our countrymen. A more liberty-sensitive populace could force existing politicians towards greater respect for liberty, roll back the police state, help elect libertarians to state office and, most importantly, expand the space for liberty in our lives so you might live with more joy and less tyranny.<br/><br/><h3>Stop the Tide of Statism</h3>If we do not make outreach projects like this happen, the cause of liberty will have missed its unique historic opportunity to stop the tide of statism and advance the cause of human rights and liberty.<br/><br/><h3>Showcase of Liberty</h3>This project is a showcase of liberty. Not only does it explain and promote liberty, it also utilizes libertarian principles. It is a decentralized effort in which anyone can participate to the extent they want. In order to fund the project, we are trading with you, free-market-style. You can even make money as a distributor. This project builds the libertarian economy while also expanding the reach of libertarian ideas and proving that liberty works.<br/><br/><h3>We Can do it Again Next Year</h3>If this project is fruitful, and I am confident it will be, we will almost certainly repeat it next year.

</div></div>","Our Story

Thailand's human-traffickers exploit and desecrate destitute children. These children deserve more than our outrage. They deserve direct and deliberate help. I am volunteering with a Social Activism program called Justifi that works to save impoverished children in Thailand from human trafficking and sexual exploitation. Justifi partners with The Sold Project and The Volunteers for Children Development Foundation to build a better world, not just imagine one. The volunteer program is for people who believe that they have a role to play in ending hunger, suffering, and exploitation. It's for people who believe in the power of here and now to make this world a better place. 



It's for people who know that outrage is not enough, that real action is the solution. It's for people who want to be an active part of that solution.





The Impact
Our aim is to intercept destitute children from human-traffickers and to ensure their fundamental human rights.

We provide emergency assistance for street children to meet their basic needs and equip them with the means to protect themselves against sexual exploitation and HIV/AIDS. We provide education and other vocational skill development. Life skills are built and developed, like creative and critical thinking, decision-making and problem-solving.  In addition, we provide assistance with nationality registration so these neglected children can obtain ID cards. 



What We Need & What You Get
I am an independent volunteer and I have been awarded a scholarship to participate in Justifi's upcoming humanitarian mission. The scholarship excludes airfare, which is approximately $1,200 from Tel Aviv (where I am a student) to Bangkok. I am fundraising so that I can seize this opportunity to help children that have been grossly mistreated and tragically ignored. With your help, I will be able to actively protect children who deserve immediate intervention, not indifference. Thank you for your care and concern.

<p><b>What is #22KILL</b>?                                                                                                                             #22KILL is a program under a veteran nonprofit organization based in Dallas, TX called Honor Courage 
Commitment, Inc.  The #22KILL initiative is to simply show your ongoing 
support for the U.S. military and the veterans who have served.  You can
 do this by wearing our Matte Black Tungsten #22KILL trademarked band on
 your right index finger.  This is what we call a ""silent salute"".

</p>
<p>When you see someone with this ring on, please make it a point to 
shake that person's hand because you share a common love and respect for
 those who serve(d).  Often times it's warriors themselves who wear the 
Honor Ring™ with pride in honor of his/her comrades.  In this case, the 
ring just did it's job because you shook a veteran's hand.</p>
<p><b>Do I have to be in the military to wear an Honor Ring™?
</b></p>
<p>No you do not.  Any person who supports those who serve(d) (active 
warriors, veterans, friends and family members) can show their 
appreciation and say ""thank you"" with a ""silent salute"" by wearing an 
Honor Ring™ on the right index finger.  It is worn on the right index 
finger because (when capable) we only salute with the right hand.</p>
<b>Why is it called #22KILL? 
</b><p>There's a staggering  statistic that 22 veterans commit suicide 
everyday.  It's important that  we raise awareness around this fact so 
that we can all do our part to  alleviate this epidemic.</p>

<p>Proceeds go to <a href=""http://www.honorcouragecommitment.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Honor Courage Commitment, Inc.</a>
 (official 501c3 tax-exempt charitable organization).  HCC has a 
holistic approach to helping veterans transition more smoothly.  By 
having an actionable plan, preferably prior to leaving the service,  
veterans are more likely to never fall into a what we call a ""downward 
spiral"" - unemployment, underutilized, loss of identity, depressed, drug
 abuse, stereotyped negatively, and leading to <em>the ultimate loss</em> - suicide.</p>
<p>For the past 3  years, HCC has helped veterans find a ""sense of 
purpose"" after serving  in the military by focusing on education, 
mentorship, and community service.  HCC creates elite veterans.  By 
leveraging the valuable skill sets  instilled in our veterans to make 
positive impacts in the community, this continues our veterans' ""sense 
of purpose"" after serving, which embodies our ethos of  ""service after 
service.""</p>
<b>Why Education?
</b><p>Most veterans earn the GI Bill which is basically a full ride to 
school.  It is absurd not to use it.  College may not be for everyone, 
but there are many other options in education that can be more fitting 
to the veteran; ie trade schools, certifications, etc.</p>
<b>Why a Mentor?
</b><p>Whether you were a private or general in the in service, you always 
had a higher rank or someone that held you accountable.  After 
transitioning out of the military, a qualified mentor who aligns with 
your goals can be your next battle buddy.  The mentor not only holds you
 accountable to your goals, but can open doors and make introductions 
for you in business.  The mentor can also be a person for you to confide
 in that can listen and provide valuable advice and make connections.</p>
<b>Why Community Service?
</b><p>Serving in the military can give veterans a heightened sense of 
purpose.  There is not anything more honorable than serving others and 
by utilizing the skill sets already instilled in veterans (leadership, 
team building/management, logistics, etc), everyone wins - local 
communities get to reap the benefits from the talents of our trained 
assets and the veterans get to continue serving - maintining their identity
 and sense of purpose.  For more info please feel free to visit HCC's main website: <a href=""http://www.veteran.me"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.veteran.me</a></p>

When 30% of target is reached we have been advised we can explore press
releases to further enhance crowd funding. The funds will be for engineering
development and fabrication of pre-manufacturing prototypes. This target
funding will take the project to a working prototype wherein investor and grant

</ul> </div> <div> <h3>What We Graciously Appreciate &amp; What YOU Get</h3> <p>It's our goal to be in a financial position where we can support you and people like you:</p> <ul> <li>With $6,500, we will put the money straight towards modest administrative costs, such as: to secure an office space, printing, even just paper clips --  the very basics. </li>
<li>$1,500 (alone) goes towards applying for tax exempt status through the IRS.</li> <li>Once this is off the ground, you can trust that we will have your back and be even more vibrant members of the community to support your causes.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact &amp; The Ripple Effect</h3> <p></p>
<p>Connection &amp; Community:</p>

gifts to serve others.  After all, it is
about <i>justice</i>, not <i>just us</i>.<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Truth</h3> <p> We are putting everything on the line to see this firm be a success.  We don't come from particularly privileged backgrounds or trust funds that would allow us to take this extraordinary leap of faith.  We're doing it solely because our hearts are in it -- we fervently believe in the cause and the tremendous potential in being able to help a huge amount of people.</p> <ul> <li>Just like you, we have familial responsibilities and bills (not to mention law school debt!) to manage while also trying to build a business from scratch.</li> <li>It is BECAUSE we have experienced financial struggles that we are even more committed to make legal access affordable.</li>
<li>With a strong foundation to kick start our success, we KNOW we will be able to put our energies towards helping the community!  </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you can't contribute financially, we COMPLETELY understand, but there are other ways you can help if you believe in our cause:</p> <ul> <li> Make some noise about the campaign!

*It is our mission to work with those who confront legal challenges and be positive agents for change in the community and the world, at large. Clear eyes & full hearts:  Advocates for Community & Transformative Justice (""ACT Just"") stands on the foundation of advocacy -- we are dedicated to the pursuit of making quality representation affordable for ALL. By using a sliding fee scale, we set a price point based on one's individual ability to pay.   Being incorporated as a non-profit allows us to be focused primarily on the mission to serve the community, not counting billable hours like the average law firm, and helps us to offer affordable fees to our clients.
   What We Graciously Appreciate & What YOU Get It's our goal to be in a financial position where we can support you and people like you:  With $6,500, we will put the money straight towards modest administrative costs, such as: to secure an office space, printing, even just paper clips --  the very basics. 
$1,500 (alone) goes towards applying for tax exempt status through the IRS. Once this is off the ground, you can trust that we will have your back and be even more vibrant members of the community to support your causes.    The Impact & The Ripple Effect 
Connection & Community:
  Our goal is to use our education and gift to serve others while facing
challenges, and in turn, those individuals are in the position to use their
gifts to serve others.  After all, it is
about justice, not just us.
    The Truth  We are putting everything on the line to see this firm be a success.  We don't come from particularly privileged backgrounds or trust funds that would allow us to take this extraordinary leap of faith.  We're doing it solely because our hearts are in it -- we fervently believe in the cause and the tremendous potential in being able to help a huge amount of people.  Just like you, we have familial responsibilities and bills (not to mention law school debt!) to manage while also trying to build a business from scratch. It is BECAUSE we have experienced financial struggles that we are even more committed to make legal access affordable.
With a strong foundation to kick start our success, we KNOW we will be able to put our energies towards helping the community!      Other Ways You Can Help If you can't contribute financially, we COMPLETELY understand, but there are other ways you can help if you believe in our cause:   Make some noise about the campaign! Share with friends & family to spread the word.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Welcome is an idea that spawned from a partnership between artist Cal Cullen, executive director of Wave Pool Art Gallery and Sheryl Rajbhandari, founder and executive director of Heartfelt Tidbits.  Both have a passion for art and humanitarian work associated with immigrants and refugees.  Welcome Home, Café and Boutique was a natural fit to provide solutions to gaps they had identified within the local community of the immigrants and refugees. </p>
<p>While the city has 80+ providers that do a tremendous job in assisting with welcoming refugees we recognize the need to expand this.  Many who are marginalized and at risk feel isolated and vulnerable.  Their art enables them to share their voice without the language and build friendships through the program.  Our goal is that this through this business we will be empower immigrants and refugees with knowledge and break down the barriers that many face related to employment and housing.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In late April we were able to open the store with a tremendous amount of community support and donated elbow grease. In order to open the cafe and merge the two storefronts however, we need some financial backing. </p>
<p>We're trying to get $10,000 which will allow us to hire a store manager, get architectural plans drawn and submitted to rehab the space, work on making the space ADA compliant, pay rent, and purchase some needed restaurant equipment.</p>
<p>As a thank you for your contribution we have some amazing perks available, including art made by the ladies who will be running the business, Welcome stationary, and hand made goods. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>The Impact of the Store:</strong></p>
<p>Over the past 9 months local immigrant and refugee women have been meeting at the Wave Pool and Reading Lockland Presbyterian Church for art and sewing classes.  Through these programs artists and skillsets have emerged.  As visitors and guest instructors have visited many asked if they could purchase items that were being locally made.  The boutique provides this opportunity.</p>
<p>The storefront is not just a retail store. It is a community living room and a workshop space. It is a place for our newest neighbors to teach their skills to the public and to share what they have made. It is a place for neighborhood kids to stop in and make art at any time. It is a place for sewing, sharing, and making friends. </p>
<p><strong>The Impact of the Cafe: </strong></p>
<p>In addition to being a full functioning restaurant in Camp Washington, the café will serve three other purposes, culinary employment training, and an incubator site for refugees who seek to someday open their own restaurant and ability for local immigrant and refugee gardeners to sell fresh produce.  A pastry chef will be employed to train students over a eight week period all aspects of operating a café, including:<br/>·      Menu planning<br/>·      Food supplies and inventory<br/>·      Food safety<br/>·      Food preparation and pastry skills</p>
<p>Upon completion of the training programs, participants will then receive assistance with obtaining food service employment.</p>
<p>Camp Washington has been identified as a food dessert in Cincinnati.  Through a partnership with Heartfelt Tidbits and Turner Farms an idea was created that local immigrant gardeners could leverage the café as a place to sell their local produce.  The produce purchased would be used for the café and also be available for purchase by the local community.  </p>
<p><strong>The Impact of the Housing:</strong></p>
<p>The “Welcome Housing Project” at 2936 Colerain Ave. consists of 8 one-bedroom apartments.  They are all currently occupied and all in relatively rough condition. As apartments are vacated, the plan is to<br/>·      Renovate them with newer appliances,<br/>·      Refinish plumbing, and<br/>·      Update heating and air conditioning units</p>
<p> We envision one or two of the apartments to be allocated for transitional housing.  The other apartments will be rented to refugees and immigrants, identified through our collaborative partners. We will work closely with our partner organizations to find the right tenants for this building. The plan is that these apartments would be part of a rental equity program, where tenants who pay rent on time and take care of their apartment will earn credits that can be redeemed toward the purchase of a home when they are ready to move.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't donate to this campaign, there are other ways to help! If you live nearby and would like to help, we accept volunteers regardless of skill level. We specifically need help cleaning, rehabbing the storefronts and apartments, and assisting us with setting up the restaurant and getting it code compliant. Donations are vital to the feasibility of this project. We are specifically looking for kitchen and dining items, retail shelving and hardware, as well as commercial kitchen fixtures. We have compiled a wishlist of these items which you can <a href=""https://static1.squarespace.com/static/58b44e13414fb57081ae7c39/t/58c16109d1758ed406684561/1489068297325/WelcomeWishList.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">view here. </a></p>

<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The impact of a project of this nature cannot be understated.  It has been my experience that with a small amount of resources and a great level of respect and resourcefulness for clients, we can accomplish a lot.  We may not end homelessness in the Durham area but by targeting the areas in which the homeless spend their time and offering them alternatives to the services they're used to receiving, we may be able to make a huge impact in their lives.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>The risks of a project like this as with any in social work is that clients won't be willing to accept help but one of the ways we can overcome that is by using our greatest asset, namely, my ability to connect with clients using 10 years of experience in the outreach and case management and my ability to empathize with an individual who may be used to being marginalized, even by other social workers they've come into contact with.  The challenges are the same; A large percentage of the people I come into contact with, whether through mental illness or drug abuse may be unwilling or unable to accept help but it is the percentage that we are able to help that will provide us with the incentive we need to move this project forward and perhaps help in some small way to change the landscape of downtown Durham.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you can't contribute, that's fine, perhaps some nights or days as we do targeted outreach, we will need volunteers to help make meals to bring out on outreach or simply, someone to come along and offer their own counterpoint to my own style of outreach.  Sometimes, clients respond well to one outreach worker and sometimes they respond to a dyad but either way, you can help get the word out that there are resources available and hopefully I can be one of those valuable resources.</p>

<p><strong>Qui sommes-nous?</strong></p>
<p>Le Comité pour les droits humains en Amérique latine (CDHAL) est une organisation de solidarité fondée en 1976 qui travaille à la défense et à la promotion des droits humains en réciprocité avec les mouvements sociaux et les communautés d’Amérique latine dans la lutte en faveur de la justice sociale, environnementale et culturelle.</p>
<p>À l’heure actuelle, la conjoncture sociopolitique en Amérique latine nous donne l’impression de replonger dans l’époque sombre des dictatures militaires et des conflits armés des années 1970-1980 en Amérique latine. Dans ce contexte, le travail du CDHAL s’avère pertinent afin de documenter et diffuser les violations des droits à la vie, à un environnement sain, à l’autodétermination, à l’intégrité, à la sécurité et à la liberté commises par les États en complicité avec de grandes entreprises transnationales, dont certaines sont canadiennes.</p>
<p>Notre mission permet d’amplifier les voix des mouvements sociaux et des organisations populaires en résistance face à l’extractivisme, la racine des violences et de la migration forcée de millions de personnes provenant des Amériques et de partout ailleurs. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Que faisons-nous concrètement?</strong></p>
<p>Le CDHAL, à travers son équipe des actions urgentes, entretient des liens de réciprocité avec les mouvements sociaux et les groupes de base en Amérique latine, notamment au Mexique, au Guatemala, au Honduras, en Colombie, en Équateur, au Brésil et au Chili. Nous sommes particulièrement interpellées par la situation de défenseur-e-s des droits humains, qui compromettent leur sécurité et leur vie en utilisant leurs corps comme boucliers pour préserver leurs territoires, l‘environnement, leurs lieux de travail et de vie, ainsi que la Terre-Mère.</p>
<p>C’est à travers le programme des actions urgentes que nous effectuons un suivi de l’actualité d’Amérique latine et la diffusons au Québec et au Canada, recevons des demandes d’appuis des communautés et des mouvements sociaux, participons à de nombreuses campagnes, et rédigeons et traduisons des communiqués, déclarations et pétitions ayant pour objectif de faire pression pour des cas particuliers et de contribuer à l’éducation du public.</p>
<p>L’équipe des actions urgentes, coordonnée par une responsable et composée de stagiaires de différents programmes universitaires et de militant.e.s, est mobilisée toute l’année afin de produire et diffuser des nouvelles en espagnol et en français pour rendre ces informations accessibles pour le public québécois, canadien et latino-américain à travers le bulletin mensuel <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/user-817746336/bulletin-solidared-voix-de-resistance-dans-les-ameriques-octobre-2019"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Solidared : voix de résistances dans les Amériques</a> (en version écrite et audio) et aussi via notre <a href=""http://www.cdhal.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">site Internet</a>, notre <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Comit%C3%A9-pour-les-droits-humains-en-Am%C3%A9rique-latine-154761649747/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">page Facebook</a> et notre compte <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/user-817746336"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Soundcloud</a>.</p>

<p>Nous nous impliquons aussi dans les initiatives de plaidoyer et d'éducation au Québec et au Canada, en co-organisant avec des organisations partenaires des actions pour rendre visibles les luttes entamées en Amérique latine. </p>
<p>À titre d’exemple, le CDHAL a mobilisé cette année des dizaines d’organisations de la société civile canadienne pour mettre en oeuvre une tournée pancanadienne ""Justice énergétique: pour la défense du fleuve Cauca"" d’une représentante du Mouvement Rios Vivos Colombia, qui depuis une décennie s’oppose à l’installation du mégaprojet hydroélectrique Hidroituango, financé entre autres par la Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec et par Exportation et développement Canada. </p>
<p>De plus, face à la récente situation d’urgence et de violence au Chili, une membre de notre équipe participe à la Mission d’observation internationale convoquée par la Coordination des organisations de droits humains de l’Araucanie afin de documenter et de diffuser les agissements de l’État chilien en ce moment. </p>
<p>Le bouleversement sociopolitique au Brésil avec l’arrivée au pouvoir de Bolsonaro a également interpellé le CDHAL qui a appuyé diverses actions avec le <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Coletivo-Brasil-Montr%C3%A9al-1041626125917438/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Coletivo Brasil-Montreal</a>, dont le <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/2429913533889813/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">colloque international “Où va le Brésil?”</a> et le concert bénéfice pour l’Amazonie qui est venu en appui à une association de femmes autochtones touchées par les incendies qui menacent encore la forêt et ses peuples.</p>

<p>Votre appui nous permettra de poursuivre notre travail quotidien de veille et de diffusion des violations des droits humains et des actions de résistance à travers les Amériques et de répondre aux différents appels de solidarité. Les raisons sont nombreuses pour continuer à lutter et à dénoncer puisque, à chaque jour, des peuples des Amériques résistent devant un modèle qui privilégie les intérêts privés et transnationaux au détriment des communautés locales et où la criminalisation des défenseur.e.s des droits humains, du territoire et de l’eau ne fait que s’intensifier avec les gouvernements d’extrême-droite.</p>

It is composed of 30 districts , with no easy roads to access these areas. Almost 2 million people live there . They are too poor to buy seeds to cultivate, water is difficult to access, no NGO is working on the ground due to the war and the  difficulties to reach these remote villages. 2 or 3 hospitals with no medicine are not working properly. This Governorate  is 5 or 6 hours far away from the capital Sanaa.</p><p>In the first six months of this year, Hajjah province, where Aslam is located, recorded 17,000 cases of severe acute malnutrition, higher than in any full year on record.</p><p>Malnourished children, who were previously treated, returned to clinics in even worse condition — if they make it back at all. And deaths happen in remote villages where people can’t reach the health units.</p><p>Aslam is one of the poorest districts in the country, with hundreds of small villages, some isolated in the high mountains. Its population of 75,000 to 106,000 includes both local residents and accelerating numbers of displaced people who fled fighting elsewhere.</p><p>In terms of hunger, Aslam isn’t alone. As there are other districts closer to war zones which may not be getting food aid at all. But Aslam did see one of the province’s highest jumps in the number of reported children suffering from severe acute malnutrition: From 384 cases being treated in January, an additional 1,319 more came in over the next six months, according to local health records. That comes to around 15 percent of the district’s children.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1540673705/ci1e2x7avqfsyn2nmvx2.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>The number of people nationwide who would starve if they didn’t receive aid grew by a quarter over the past year, now standing at 8.4 million of Yemen’s 29 million people, according to U.N. figures.

Since March 2015, 9,245 people have been killed and 52,800 injured. Coalition air strikes are the leading cause of civilian casualties. According to the U.N. Human Rights Council, civilians have repeatedly been the victims of ""unrelenting violations of international humanitarian law."" About 75 percent of the population — 22.2 million people — needs humanitarian assistance. Some 17.8 million people do not know where their next meal is coming from, and 8.4 million are considered at risk of starvation. Severe acute malnutrition is threatening the lives of almost 400,000 children under the age of 5. Half of the country's 3,500 health facilities are functioning and at least 16.4 million people lack basic health care. Medics have struggled to cope with the world's largest cholera outbreak, with more than 1 million suspected cases and 2,248 associated deaths since April 2017. More than 3 million people have been forced to flee their homes, including 2 million who remain displaced.</p><p><strong>Key Facts about Yemen</strong></p><p>Three and a half years of conflict have left 22.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, 11.3 of which are in acute need.

It is composed of 30 districts , with no easy roads to access these areas. Almost 2 million people live there . They are too poor to buy seeds to cultivate, water is difficult to access, no NGO is working on the ground due to the war and the  difficulties to reach these remote villages. 2 or 3 hospitals with no medicine are not working properly. This Governorate  is 5 or 6 hours far away from the capital Sanaa.In the first six months of this year, Hajjah province, where Aslam is located, recorded 17,000 cases of severe acute malnutrition, higher than in any full year on record.Malnourished children, who were previously treated, returned to clinics in even worse condition — if they make it back at all. And deaths happen in remote villages where people can’t reach the health units.Aslam is one of the poorest districts in the country, with hundreds of small villages, some isolated in the high mountains. Its population of 75,000 to 106,000 includes both local residents and accelerating numbers of displaced people who fled fighting elsewhere.In terms of hunger, Aslam isn’t alone. As there are other districts closer to war zones which may not be getting food aid at all. But Aslam did see one of the province’s highest jumps in the number of reported children suffering from severe acute malnutrition: From 384 cases being treated in January, an additional 1,319 more came in over the next six months, according to local health records. That comes to around 15 percent of the district’s children. The number of people nationwide who would starve if they didn’t receive aid grew by a quarter over the past year, now standing at 8.4 million of Yemen’s 29 million people, according to U.N. figures. That number is likely to soon jump by another 3.5 million because the currency is losing value, leaving growing numbers of people unable to afford food, the U.N. warned this month. Aim of Mona Relief in HajjahMona Relief Organization aims through this campaign to helping malnourished children along with their families in that area with food aid baskets in an attempt to alleviate the suffering of people there. Our donors through this campaign will be updated about what we have done in the field by posting pictures and videos that taken during the food aid distribution.Yemen Organization for Humanitarian Relief and Development (Mona), is a national Independent, non-governmental and non-profitable organization based in the capital Sana'a, Yemen. Mona Relief was established in May 2015 by the journalist Fatik al-Rodaini in Yemen.Mona Relief has been carried out over 200 projects in Yemen since the war started in 2015. Food Distributions in Hajjah, October 2018We went to Hajjah this October 2018 where we the Mona Relief team did a fantastic work, and we are planning to do so again as soon as the campaign ends.Some pictures of our Food Distribution in Hajjah (17th of October, 2018) A beautiful moment of a kid smiling to our team. Previous ProjectsHave a look at some of our projects during the last years.  What Is Happening to Yemen?Saudi Arabia together with a coalition launched a bombing campaign in Yemen on 25 March 2015 and imposed a blockade on all Yemeni sea, land and airports which has restricted entry of all supplies into the country.To get more information about the current situation in Yemen you have to read thisYemen has become a failed and devastated state. Since March 2015, 9,245 people have been killed and 52,800 injured. Coalition air strikes are the leading cause of civilian casualties. According to the U.N. Human Rights Council, civilians have repeatedly been the victims of ""unrelenting violations of international humanitarian law."" About 75 percent of the population — 22.2 million people — needs humanitarian assistance. Some 17.8 million people do not know where their next meal is coming from, and 8.4 million are considered at risk of starvation. Severe acute malnutrition is threatening the lives of almost 400,000 children under the age of 5. Half of the country's 3,500 health facilities are functioning and at least 16.4 million people lack basic health care. Medics have struggled to cope with the world's largest cholera outbreak, with more than 1 million suspected cases and 2,248 associated deaths since April 2017. More than 3 million people have been forced to flee their homes, including 2 million who remain displaced.Key Facts about YemenThree and a half years of conflict have left 22.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, 11.3 of which are in acute need. This increase is driven by a deterioration of the situation in key humanitarian sectors.Food Security and Agriculture17.8 million people in Yemen are food insecure. Out of this, approximately 8.4 million people are severely food insecure and at risk of starvation - a worrying increase of 24 per cent. The conflict has destroyed people’s livelihoods and reduced their purchasing power, making it difficult for many Yemenis to meet minimal food needs.HealthWith only 50 per cent of health facilities fully functional, and a disruption of salaries paid to health personnel, 16.4 million people in Yemen require assistance to ensure adequate access to healthcare – 9.3 million of whom are in acute need.The overriding humanitarian need is access to minimum healthcare for people whose lives are at risk due to illness or injury. The latest cholera outbreak has underscored the impact of the failing health system.Water, Sanitation and hygieneAn estimated 16 million Yemenis need humanitarian assistance to establish or maintain access to safe water, basic sanitation and hygiene facilities, out of which 11.6 million are in acute need. Collapsing urban water and sanitation systems, deteriorating water and sanitation conditions in rural areas, and lack of means to maintain personal hygiene and purchase safe drinking water all contributed to one of the worst cholera outbreaks.MalnutritionSome 1.8 million children and 1.1 million pregnant or lactating women are acutely malnourished, including 400,000 children under the age 5 who are suffering from severe acute malnutrition. An estimated 7.5 million people are in need of nutrition assistance, with 2.9 million people who will require treatment for acute malnutrition in 2017.Shelter and essential itemsAn estimated 5.4 million people need emergency shelter or essential household items, including IDPs, host communities and initial returnees. Ongoing conflict-related displacements, as well as initial returns to some areas, are driving these needs. 2.6 million people are in acute need of assistance.ProtectionWith the increasing conflict, Yemen is one of the world’s largest protection crises. About 12.9 million people need assistance to protect their safety, dignity or basic rights, from violations of IHL, grave violations of children’s rights and gender-based violence.Displacement and conflict has impacted vulnerable households and persons with specific needs, resulting in negative coping mechanisms and mounting psychosocial support needs. 4.9 million people are living in acutely affected areas.EducationThe 2017/2018 school year started with a setback in the education process in 13 out of 22 governorates. This is due to the extended time of non-payment of salaries for teachers. Schools across the country are unfit for use due to conflict-related damage, hosting of IDPs, or occupation by armed groups. An estimated 4.1 million school-age children require assistance to continue their education.Livelihoods and community resilienceAround 8 million conflict-affected individuals require livelihoods assistance to enhance their selfreliance to address basic needs and reduce dependency on relief assistance. Communities require support to promote resilience, including clearance of landmines and other explosives in up to 22 governorates. SITUATION IN YEMEN IN NUMBERS11.3 millionchildren in need of humanitarian assistance (estimated)22.2 million# of people in need (Periodic Monitoring Review HCT, Apr 2017)1.6 million# of children internally displaced (IDPs) and returnees out of2.9 million# of IDPs and returnees (Task Force on Population Movement 14th report, Protection Cluster, July 2017)460,000children under 5 suffering from Severe Acute Malnutrition (SAM)16 millionPeople in need of WASH assistance16.4 millionPeople in need of basic health care12.9 millionPeople in need of protection6.31 millionWomen who need protectionMore than one million suspected cholera cases2.247+people killed by cholera59+people killed by diphtheria About Mona Relief YemenMona Relief is a 100% Yemeni Organization based in Sanaa, Yemen.

<h3><strong>Who we are</strong></h3>
<p><strong>InPower is an open source and crowd-funded movement</strong> of, by, and for the people. We believe that the combination of independent media, truth, faith in our Creator or Source, and the effective enforcement of accountability upon those in positions of social leadership are keys to preserving and restoring human rights. We are devoted to this purpose.</p>
<h3>What we are building</h3>
<p>We have uncovered and refined a revolutionary new process: <strong>enforcing the individual commercial liability of corporate executives and government representatives who are causing egregious harm.</strong> Propaganda and legal loopholes will no longer work for those putting profits before people — because we've learned to speak their ""language"", playing by the very rules of their very own system.</p>
<p>We are in the latter stages of <strong>building a new website (view it at <a href=""https://inpowermovement.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">inpowermovement.com</a>!) to simplify and support this process,</strong> and to provide an <strong>online community hub </strong>so that anyone who wants to see their individual or the collective situation improve for the better, can participate in a rewarding and cost-effective manner.</p>

<h3>
<br/>Our intent</h3>
<p>The difference is this: the InPower Movement is dedicated to lovingly serve the life of the people. We do not seek vengeance. <strong>We seek accountability, justice, peace, alignment with truth, preservation of individual rights and removal of artificial barriers to a better world.</strong> (The artificial barriers seem to always be about more control and more money.)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501966444/od82seijkc8ujb3d4lut.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Where we are</h3>
<p>Over the past two years we've been building and refining a process of commercial liability that can be used by anyone to help hold people in power accountable and financially liable for their actions. We've piloted three ""seed"" groups with significant positive results from only a limited number of participants. <strong>We are 80% of the way towards completion </strong>and launch of a website with an action center designed to simplify and support large numbers of participants throughout the US and Canada.</p>
<h3>What is the Liability Action?</h3>
<p>A great question! Please see our new Overview document (added 14 August 2017):</p>
<p><a href=""https://inpowermovement.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/InPower-liability-action-overview.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502738936/znruvydjoygbvugaggrq.png"" src="""" style=""""/></a><br/> </p>
<h3>Does it work?</h3>
<p>Our seed groups have positive results, summarized on the document and Preview Clip, both posted above <strong>↑</strong>. <strong>These results indicate that yes, commercial liability is indeed a viable mechanism to restore balance and accountability, wherever harm is being done. </strong><br/> </p>
<h3>Problems we will help solve</h3>
<p>Our launch focus is directed specifically towards the hazards surrounding<strong> 'smart' meters</strong>. The next phase is to advocate for safety and transparency around <strong>vaccinations </strong>and the planned roll-out of <strong>5G technology</strong>.</p>

<h3>What we need</h3>
<p><strong>We are seeking funding </strong>to finalize and deliver a safe and efficient catalyst that makes this process readily available to all, with step-by-step guides, support, and together with each other in community. At this critical hour we are disclosing the solution we've been building and preparing behind the scenes for the past two years. We need your help to make this happen.</p>

Who we are
InPower is an open source and crowd-funded movement of, by, and for the people. We believe that the combination of independent media, truth, faith in our Creator or Source, and the effective enforcement of accountability upon those in positions of social leadership are keys to preserving and restoring human rights. We are devoted to this purpose.
What we are building
We have uncovered and refined a revolutionary new process: enforcing the individual commercial liability of corporate executives and government representatives who are causing egregious harm. Propaganda and legal loopholes will no longer work for those putting profits before people — because we've learned to speak their ""language"", playing by the very rules of their very own system.
We are in the latter stages of building a new website (view it at inpowermovement.com!) to simplify and support this process, and to provide an online community hub so that anyone who wants to see their individual or the collective situation improve for the better, can participate in a rewarding and cost-effective manner.
WATCH EP#1 PREVIEW CLIP: EARLY RESULTS FROM THE INPOWER LIABILITY ACTION:


Our intent
The difference is this: the InPower Movement is dedicated to lovingly serve the life of the people. We do not seek vengeance. We seek accountability, justice, peace, alignment with truth, preservation of individual rights and removal of artificial barriers to a better world. (The artificial barriers seem to always be about more control and more money.)

 
Where we are
Over the past two years we've been building and refining a process of commercial liability that can be used by anyone to help hold people in power accountable and financially liable for their actions. We've piloted three ""seed"" groups with significant positive results from only a limited number of participants. We are 80% of the way towards completion and launch of a website with an action center designed to simplify and support large numbers of participants throughout the US and Canada.
What is the Liability Action?
A great question! Please see our new Overview document (added 14 August 2017):
 
Does it work?
Our seed groups have positive results, summarized on the document and Preview Clip, both posted above ↑. These results indicate that yes, commercial liability is indeed a viable mechanism to restore balance and accountability, wherever harm is being done.  
Problems we will help solve
Our launch focus is directed specifically towards the hazards surrounding 'smart' meters. The next phase is to advocate for safety and transparency around vaccinations and the planned roll-out of 5G technology.
 
What we need
We are seeking funding to finalize and deliver a safe and efficient catalyst that makes this process readily available to all, with step-by-step guides, support, and together with each other in community. At this critical hour we are disclosing the solution we've been building and preparing behind the scenes for the past two years. We need your help to make this happen.
How will the funds be spent?

A history of bringing light where it is dark
Our work started by making the internationally award-winning documentary Take Back Your Power - a film exposing the 'smart' meter agenda - which was released worldwide in 2013.

With approximately 500 public screenings internationally and a quarter million viewings, we shone the light on a sinister subject: how utilities have teamed with governments to deploy harmful technology to surveil and market the data of everything we do in our homes.
(NOTE: We've just completed Take Back Your Power: 2017 Final Cut, which ships on September 30, 2017. Own and share this ultra-inspiring new cut on DVD on our website here.)

With the InPower Movement, this film has now birthed a revolutionary kind of activism that will enable millions to truly take back their power.
Our new InPower Docu-Series is a deep dive into a new, game-changing method of activism: the world's first mass-action of liability.
 
It's time to take back our power.
We see millions rising up. They are standing peacefully yet firmly, with equal authority in the language of the ""system"" — which, by putting money before people, has lost its moral conscience.
Those standing are InPowered with the confident knowledge of how to finally protect their rights, health, and families. They know who they are. They feel the fringes of a new hope. And they won't be denied a future.",7.0,1,"1 Campaign

""Climate change is an immediate and significant threat to our communities and our economy."" - Justin Trudeau during the 2015 election.
""It's well known that one of the consequences of climate change will be a greater prevalence of extreme weather events around the planet.""  - Justin Trudeau (May 4, 2016)
As of August 15th, 2018 there are 566 wildfires burning in BC, thousands of people are being evacuated from their homes and the province has declared a state of emergency.  
Since 1970, wildland fire management expenditures across Canada have been rising by about $120 million per decade - by 2040 the government expects this spending to double. 
The Trudeau Liberals' solution? Spend $4.5 billion bailing out the Kinder Morgan pipeline. The climate impacts of that very pipeline are projected to cost us $2.1 to $8.7 billion in upfront costs, and at least $675 million a year, for as long as the pipeline operates. So that's stupid, but it's also why Trudeau doesn't want to connect wildfire costs to climate change - because it exposes the deadly idiocy of his big oil bailout. Together we can force him to do just that.
Your money is going to help people whose lives have been devastated by climate change. Furthermore, the more we help people the more attention this campaign will get. We'll execute a national and international media strategy to create headlines that will force the Trudeau government to face the disastrous impacts of their pro-fossil fuel policies.

Where's the money going?
50% of the money raised will go to support the Red Cross wildfire relief in Canada. The other 50% goes to support the impoverished Filipino community of Anibong, Leyte whose people are being displaced by stronger and stronger storms.

<h3>The Scoop</h3>
<p>When a child enters foster care, it can take time to find a place where that child can stay while the case worker sets up a place for that child (or children) to go. Many times, siblings are not able to stay together due to a deficiently in homes that are available. </p>

<p>72 hours. That's all it takes to give the case worker time to find the best living situation.</p>
<p>But currently, they don't have 72 hours so children and youth can end up going to another county, being placed in a group home or in very extreme circumstances, can be placed out of state. </p>

<h3>How Can You Help?</h3>
<p>Our non-profit, Faith, Hope &amp; Love, has determined that we can provide those 72 hours. By opening a receiving home in Racine County, our facility will be able to house 8-10 children in a natural home environment, with toys, games, a kitchen, bedrooms and a living room. </p>
<p>While the children are in our care, they will receive food, clothing, medical needs and most importantly, love. We will work hard to support the foster system and give them the time they need to find the best home for our children. </p>

There is no simple fix.</p><p><strong>Who we are</strong>:</p><p>Everyone is Ohana is a group of students making an effort to make a difference. We have seen the needs in the community first hand, and have decided to do something about it. Every project that we have led thus far has been focused on helping students and members of the community see the homeless as people.</p><p><strong>What we believe</strong>:</p><p>We believe that everyone should be treated fairly and as a human being. We like to think of everyone as one big family. We believe that the needs of the homeless are far too varied to be able to be solved by one blanket solution. Because of this we are working with each of them on an individual level. We believe that as we see them as valuable parts of society, as we listen to them, and encourage them to do better, that they will then be empowered to rise to the level that we see them at. If all we ever expect from, and see is a drug addict, then that’s all they ever will be. But if you see them as a brother, a friend, a hard worker. Then it allows them to improve.</p><p>We believe that to help someone overcome their challenges and no longer be homeless they need 3 things.</p><p>1. Health</p><p>2. Shelter/security</p><p>3.

We have passed out food, clothing, camping supplies. We have plans for service projects that will give them free haircuts, job training's, and even showers. But most importantly we have developed relationships with them, and they trust us.</p><p>We have the resources already to make a difference. We have volunteers, a continual supply of food donated from local restaurants (Kualoa ranch as well as the Polynesian culture center). As well as the surplus items from the student run thrift store (Give and take). We have been able to address some of their short term needs, and we are now hoping take the next step further and help address their more serious long term needs.  </p><p><strong>Why we need you</strong>:</p><p>We are working with our partners to develop curriculum that can help rehabilitate the homeless so that they can overcome the barriers that are keeping them homeless. Programs that teach budgeting and financial accountability, addiction recovery programs, and trade school skills that can help them add value in the job market. We don’t claim to know the answer to help all of the homeless, but if we can teach someone something that will improve their lives, we feel it is our duty to try.</p><p>We also need cash donations to be able to buy the items that we have not been able to get donated. Things that they are in immediate need of, such as: Clean underwear, hygiene items, feminine supplies, water filters, over the counter medicine, and other things that we have not gotten donated.</p><p><strong>What we need you to do</strong>:</p><p>Next time you see a homeless person, please, try talking to them. See what their story is before being so quick to judge them. They may just teach you something.

<p><b>The Migrant Worker Rights Network (MWRN) </b>represents all migrant workers in Thailand. The MWRN aims to support and raise funds, with your vital assistance, for the defense and humanitarian supporting during imprisonment of Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo (Win Zaw Htun), two 22 year old Myanmar workers prosecuted and convicted with a death penalty applied on 24th Dec 2015 for the rape and murder of Hannah Witheridge and murder of David Miller, both British tourists, which occurred on Koh Tao Island, Thailand in Sept 2014.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>The guilty verdict was given on December 24<sup>th</sup> 2015 when both Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were both found guilty of rape and murder and given the death sentence. The accused are currently on death row at Bang Kwang high security prison in Nonthaburi Province of Thailand near to Bangkok. On 23rd February 2017, Region 8 Appeals Court upheld the conviction and death penalty sentence against the two accused and this judgement is currently pending appeal by the defense team to Thailand's Supreme Court.</b></p>
<p>The appeals process for Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo against their verdict and sentencing is a long one. It was first to the Appeals Court (submitted in May 2016, 9-12 months was expected for verdict delivered in February 2017) and then on to the Supreme Court (2-5 years after original conviction expected for final verdict). The final appeal to the Supreme Court has now commenced with a team of lawyers from the Lawyers Council of Thailand working on the appeal alongside MWRN and a number of domestic and foreign criminal justice/crime scene/forensics experts. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>MWRN’s involvement in the Koh Tao murder case began in Oct 2014 amidst widespread allegations regarding:</p>
<ol>
<li>Arrest of ‘scapegoats’.</li>
<li>Torture of Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo during detention prior to questioning by investigation officials.</li>
<li>Improper collection of forensic evidence during crime scene investigations.</li>
<li>Intimidation and abuse of witnesses and suspects</li>
</ol>

<p> </p>
<p>MWRN intends to contribute to a fair appeals process post conviction for Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo to prevent a potential miscarriage of justice that would impact negatively on families, communities and everyone deeply affected by this case. MWRN also wants to ensure that migrants, who contribute much through their work and presence to the prosperity of Koh Tao and to Thailand, will feel justice is achieved from this case. In addition to families and friends of all those concerned, Thailand’s migrant community has been deeply impacted and moved by the tragic deaths of Hannah and David and the arrest and prosecution of Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo, their fellow nationals, for the crime. The migrant community and those in Myanmar have rose up against the verdict and protests continue.</p>
<p>‘<i>A fair appeals process for Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo is essential to ensure, with more confidence, that those guilty of this crime are held accountable and that there is no punishment of the wrong people. It would be a double injustice if  the lack of a legal defense team to carry out defense work effectively for Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo, meant that the real killers went free whilst innocent people were jailed, even executed. If Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo are innocent, no-one wants such a situation to arise. That’s why MWRN has set up this fund, to support some significant defense related costs in this case.</i>’ - Ko Sein Htay, MWRN President/Fund Administrator</p>

<p><b>Why Does MWRN Need YOU?</b></p>
<p><i>‘Now we have seen the light of hope for justice and truth as so many people have become involved in defending us and supporting our case.’</i> – Zaw Lin/Wai Phyo, Feb. 2015</p>
<p>In order to minimise risk of a miscarriage of justice, MWRN continues to publicly seek financial/other practical support to contribute our part of costs needed to cover all expenses, to ensure a fair trial through an effective appeals process for Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo. Expenses MWRN seek to contribute to now include:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Flights and travel costs for defense team members involved in attending meetings and planning sessions concerning the appeal of the convictions and sentencing and for visits to Bang Kwang Prison to meet with the accused during the appeals process</span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Travel/accommodation costs for expert advisors during the appeals process </span></li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Prison support costs for Zaw Lin/Wai Phyo during continued detention in Bang Kwang Prison, including travel costs for prison visitors</span></li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to note that all those working on the defense case (including lawyers, assistants, investigators, prison visitors, translators and campaigners) are doing so <b>pro-bono or free of charge</b>. Fundraising only seeks to cover <b>expenses</b>. The Lawyers Council of Thailand is also supporting some of the defense team by covering basic expenses for main practicing lawyers.</p>MWRN previously raised 812, 000 Thai Baht (around US$25, 000) to assist the defense of Wai Phyo and Zaw Lin in late 2014. These funds were exhausted during the emergency and initial stages of the defense engagement. Youcaring website unexpectedly, and without notice, withdrew MWRN's 'Justice: Koh Tao Case' fundraiser from its site in January 2015, claiming a sudden change of website regulations to disallow criminal defense fundraisers. This is why MWRN launched this an urgent trial preparation STAGE TWO two fundraiser with Indiegogo. Within 48 days of starting this 60 day campaign, MWRN met our £10,000 modest fundraising target and our campaign moved into InDemand to allow us to keep up the push for further donations to make our work more effective (<i>for updates on the spending of all MWRN raised funds, please see the updates section of this site</i>). MWRN has now raised a total of over 2 million baht for this case defence of which almost all funds have been exhausted during the trial and first instance appeals process, The fundraiser now moves into STAGE THREE for the Supreme Court appeals process and for continued humanitarian support to the 2 convicted men. </div>

<div> <b>OUR Challenges </b><p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>‘Before and during the case investigation we had no chance to speak out on our innocence or the truth. We are victims of influential people.'</i> – Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo’s message written in court on 26<sup>th</sup> Dec. 2014</p>
<p>Our challenge is to achieve justice in this carefully monitored case, whilst working within the boundaries of the Thai judicial system, with its pride and reputation at stake. There is also the challenge of the on-going situation of powerlessness, discrimination and exploitation faced by migrant workers in Thailand. Genuine justice is obtained through ensuring the equality of resources for both the prosecution and defense teams. It is essential that the defense team has the resources to appeal their case and prepare and appeal to the best of their ability, to ensure that two innocent young men are not convicted and possibly executed for these murders. In this worse case scenario, there would be no justice for Hannah and David and those who loved them, but only two more innocent victims in this very disturbing and important trial.</p>

<p>The defense team, consisting of pro bono lawyers associated with the Lawyers Council of Thailand and assisted by rights activists, face an exceptional challenge. More than a hundred witnesses and a thousand pages of statements/forensic case related evidence was put forward in this case and had to be understood. 21 days of trial testimony by 34 witnesses and more than a thousand pages of a prosecution file needs to be reviewed again for the appeals process, as well as the new appeals court judgement and prosecution submissions made as part of this process, All appeals processes are conducted in the Thai language and must then be translated into the Burmese and English language. Even more financial and practical constraints are faced in working with experts outside of Thailand, to prevent a miscarriage of justice.</p>

<p>In the early morning of 15<sup>th</sup> September 2014, two young British tourists Hannah Witheridge (23) and David Miller (24) were murdered on Koh Tao, a popular tourist destination in the Gulf of Thailand. The two victim’s bodies were reportedly found amongst rocks in a secluded area of the popular Sairee Beach.</p>
<p>Two weeks into the murder investigation, police had yet to charge anyone with the murders. Amidst conflicting statements regarding evidence and suspects, the investigation appeared increasingly disorganised.</p>
<p><b>Investigators of this case have been criticised for the alleged mishandling of forensic evidence, abuse of suspects and intimidation of witnesses, particularly migrant workers living on Koh Tao</b>.</p>
<p>A huge shadow has been cast, not only over the safety of tourism, but also over the reliability of the criminal justice system in Thailand, to hold someone responsible for these high profile murders. </p>
<p>Whilst under pressure to make an arrest, Thai officials suggested that migrant workers committed these murders. For many, these statements reflected the historical and systematic discrimination long faced by migrant workers in Thailand. Migrant workers are still frequent victims of abuse and extortion by Thai law enforcement officials. They are consistently treated like second-class citizens, with little access to effective justice, remedies or any complaint mechanisms.</p>
<p>Blanket DNA testing of the migrant community was then undertaken amidst fears that the migrant community would be persecuted as ‘scapegoats’ for these murders, as a result of their powerlessness to fight back. Shortly after the murders, migrant workers on Koh Tao began to petition MWRN with video and photographic evidence alleging physical and verbal abuse by investigation officials during questionings. Migrant communities throughout Thailand also communicated to MWRN their concerns that Thai authorities would unfairly scapegoat Myanmar migrant workers for these horrific murders.</p>

Zaw Lin (21) worked at Brother Bar and Wai Phyo (21) worked at Safety Stop restaurant on Koh Tao at the time of the murders.</p>
<p>Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo’s purpose in Thailand was to send money home to support their parents and siblings living in poverty in Myanmar. Both had been working on Koh Tao for several years.</p>

<p><b>Zaw Lin and Wei Phyo’s Claims of Innocence </b></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>During the initial weeks of detention in Koh Samui prison, Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were permanently shackled and confined to a high security cell 24 hours a day, only being allowed out to meet with authorised visitors. Prison authorities justified this treatment based on suicide risks and the potential danger both supposedly posed to fellow prisoners. Following complaints by rights groups, Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were eventually unshackled and allowed to join other prisoners outside of their cell during daytime hours only.</p>
<p>Several days after being arrested, Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo told human rights monitors at Koh Samui prison that they were abused and tortured following detention, prior to being handed over to investigation officials. A week later, both pleaded innocence to rights lawyers organised for them. Both alleged their heads were covered with bags to imitate suffocation, while they were also threatened with electrocution, burning and execution to elicit confessions. Misconduct of translators assisting investigators was also alleged.</p>
<p>‘<i>We are poor, so we came to Thailand to work and save money…In the beginning when we arrived in Thailand we suffered many difficulties, we do not want to be suffering like poor people and we tried to work hard and sent money back to our parents regularly, we were happy so much for that. But now our hopes are broken. We are worried about our parents, who will support them? And we miss our parents every day, when we miss them we are crying</i>…’ – Zaw Lin and Wei Phyo’s letter to Aung San Suu Kyi, Dec. 2014</p>

<p><b>The Formal Charges and Not Guilty Pleas</b></p>
<p>Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were officially arraigned on 4<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> December 2014 at Koh Samui Court by the Koh Samui prosecutor's office. The charges levied against them included: killing the two deceased intentionally; killing Hannah to cover up her rape and to avoid punishment; raping and assaulting Hannah with violent acts; being non-Thai nationals entering into Thailand irregularly and remaining in Thailand irregularly; and Wei Phyo is charged alone with theft of a mobile phone and a pair of sunglasses, both allegedly belonging to David Miller. Both Zaw Lin and Wei Phyo pleaded not guilty to all the charges filed against them.</p>

<p><b>UK Government Case Investigation</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>There followed intense media coverage and public concern which was expressed in the form of online campaigns regarding the reliability of the Thai police investigation and the arrest of Zaw Lin and Wei Phyo. UK Prime Minister David Cameron and UK authorities strongly engaged Thai officials. Officials from the UK sought to send a team of qualified British police to Thailand to investigate the murders and report back to the deceased’s families. Since this time, MWRN and Zaw Lin and Wei Phyo’s defense team have been working with Reprieve in London to explore the UK Government’s role in investigating this case. This led to disclosure of a Metropolitan Police letter dated 19th December 2014 that stated in summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Metropolitan police did not conduct any investigations into these murders in Thailand. Instead, during a visit to Thailand in November 2014, three UK police officials were granted observer status only to limited parts of the Thai police investigation, they did not provide any advice or assistance, and relied on the translation services of a Thai police translator. During their visit these officials did not take possession of any evidence, physical or forensic, and did not collect exhibits, interviews or statements</li>
<li>The Metropolitan police were preparing a report on observations from their visit to Thailand, to be completed in January 2015. This report was to be for internal use only and would not be shared with the Thai authorities or other persons. Furthermore, the request from the defense team to review this report was denied as, relying on an exemption under the UK data protection law, it would ‘clearly prejudice’ the criminal prosecution in question and undermine prevention and detection of crime </li>
<li>No other case information would be shared with Thai authorities or the defense team by UK authorities for use in a criminal process which lacks the necessary assurances regarding use of the death penalty</li>
</ul>
<p>The validity of this Metropolitan Police response was under question after further investigations by MWRN and the defense team, which has uncovered an acknowledgement by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) that there may have been informal sharing of UK based witness statements by local police forces with Thai authorities despite concerns over whether necessary assurances regarding the death penalty were first obtained by the concerned authorities. There were also issues surrounding sharing information on the case related mobile phone. A High Court London challenge for the accused to get advance disclosure of the Metropolitan Police report on the UK investigation into their case, prosecuted by an expert team of UK Human Rights Lawyers and with assistance from Reprieve, was rejected by the court on the grounds of national security. </p>

<p><b>Koh Tao Murder Case Trial</b></p>

Defence witness hearings days were set as </span><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">1st-2nd Sept</a><span> and </span><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">22nd-25th Sept</a><span>. An extra day of witness testimony was allowed on 11th Sept. The verdict in the case was agreed on as 24th Dec 2015. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Flaws in the Investigation Highlight During Trial</b></p>
<p>A 21-day trial eventually commenced on 8th July 2015, with 3 days extension granted in the hearings, involving 34 witnesses and thousands of pages of evidence has already been widely publicised by media.</p>
<p>The closing statement considered the testimony of the prosecution witnesses so as to compare the reliability of this witness testimony alongside that of the defence witnesses also for the court’s benefit in issuing a judgement on the case. The statement highlighted as follows:</p>
<p>1. The case questioning and charging of the accused prior to prosecution was unlawful. The accused questioning after arrest and the process of notifying them of the charges against them were incorrect. The accused were questioned without lawyers or trusted persons present. The accused were not read their rights as criminal suspects or explained the nature of offences they were charged with. Neither of the accused were provided with adequate translation and legal representation as required by law. The accused’s DNA samples were taken from them involuntarily and are hence inadmissible as evidence in court.</p>
<p><span>2. The accused’s original confessions during questioning cited by the prosecution in court came about involuntarily from torture or abuse that made them fear for their lives. These written confessions, even if they had been signed, should not be considered by the Court. Other documents that were also written for the accused and which they involuntarily signed without understanding them, likewise shouldn’t be considered by the court. The videoed or staged re-enactments undertaken by the accused and submitted by the prosecution to the Court were likewise involuntary, staged under threat of violence and shouldn’t be considered or should be inadmissible as evidence in court. </span></p>
<p><span>3. There is no link between the alleged murder weapon (a hoe) and the accused. DNA samples from the hoe don’t match the accused DNA profiles but instead match the DNA profiles of other individuals. </span></p>
<p><span>4. The DNA evidence allegedly matching the accused as well as all surrounding or circumstantial evidence in this case apparently showing the guilt of the accused is unreliable and should be inadmissible and not considered by the Court. All of this evidence was not collected, tested or analysed in accordance with internationally accepted standards such as ISO 17025. This evidence should not be considered as satisfying beyond reasonable doubt that the accused violently raped and murdered the female deceased or murdered the male deceased. This includes all evidence linking the accused to the alleged crime scene such as cigarette butts, theft of the male deceased’s mobile phone and sunglasses as well as a ‘running man’ caught on CCTV. </span></p>
<p><span>5. The prosecution case is marked by an absence of significant evidence needed to prove the guilt of the accused for crimes they are charged with. This absent evidence includes photographs of the crime scene, autopsy and DNA analysis processes, chain of custody documents for forensic evidence, certain forensic evidence documents as well as detailed DNA analysis laboratory case notes. In addition, the clothes and the body surface of the female deceased expected to contain significant traces of DNA of the perpetrators were either not tested at all or tested but not included in the prosecution file or case evidence list. CCTV footage provided by the prosecution seemed to be incomplete and no fingerprint or footprint evidence was presented as part of the prosecution case.</span></p>
<p>The conclusion of the closing statement was the opinion of the two accused in calling for the Court to issue a judgement on 24th December 2015 dismissing all the charges against them.</p>
<p><b>The Guilty Verdict</b></p>
<p>On the morning of December 24th Wai Phyo and Zaw Lin were found guilty of the murder of David Miller and Hannah Witheridge and sentenced to death. They each received additional 20 year sentences for the rape of Ms Witheridge and were also found guilty of seeking to cover up their crimes, for robbery and immigration offences .</p>
<p>Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were transferred to death row in Nakhon Si Thammarat high security prison on 26th December where they will remain confined to their cell 24/7 for the first month of incarceration and in shackles for four months. At night the small cell holds 61 prisoners. It is unclear whether these restraint mechanisms will be eased as officials suggested would be the case.</p>
<p><b>The Appeal</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Koh Tao defence team and MWRN respectfully disagree that the case against the accused was not proven beyond reasonable doubt. We take the clear position that the collection, analysis &amp; reporting of forensic case materials didn't meet international standards. Crucial DNA analysis in the case was poorly presented to the court, no evidence was available that this collection or analysis complied with ISO 17025 standards. No full chain of custody documents given to court which ruled out defence's trust in conducting re-testing of whatever samples provided for retesting. The fact the Court ruled that the prosecution case and investigation or analysis was of an international standard will be strongly challenged on appeal by the defence, as outlined above.</p>
<p>THE APPEALS PROCEDURE<br/>The lengthy process begins of drafting, debating and finalising Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo's written appeal against both the judgement and sentencing verdict of the first instance Court to the Appeals Court and now the Region 8 Court of appeal.</p>
<p>The full Samui Court judgement is translated into English language by volunteers for sharing with the defence team's foreign advisors and forensic/CSI/DNA experts to get their important feedback on the judgement to support the defence team further in drafting the defendants appeal. The Region 8 Appeals Court verdict upholding this original conviction is currently being translated also.</p>
<p>Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo's written appeal to the First Instance Appeals Court was submitted in May 2016. The written appeal to the Supreme Court, following an upholding of their original conviction by the Appeals Court on 23rd February 2017, should be submitted within 30 days but appeal submission extension requests beyond 30 days can be requested by lawyers and are usually granted. In this case an extension request is likely by defence team lawyers given the significant amount of evidence amassed from a 21 day trial consisting of 34 witnesses testimony and 1000s of pages of submitted evidence and appeals documents, and given all the defence team are pro bono working on this case alongside other existing commitments.</p>
<p>Region 8 Appeals Court in Surat Thani Province considered the convicted men's written appeal in this case, together with the written response to the defendant’s appeal that the prosecution submitted to the appeals court in October 2016 before ruling on the case. The Supreme Court will now consider the convicted men's new appeal in this case, together with any response to the defendant's appeal that the prosecution choses to submit to the Court before ruling on the case.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court will also consider all other evidence before it in making its judgement on the appeal, which will usually consist of the original first instance court and appeals court judgements, all related original trial and appeal materials (including the defence and prosecution witness testimonies, cross examinations, closing statement submissions, appeals submissions and all other written evidence, documents, and materials presented to the court by the prosecution and the defence).</p>
<p>The Supreme Court, after considering all these materials, will write and issue it's judgement/verdict on the case and sentencing and this written judgement should be passed on to be read by Koh Samui Court in a full court appeal verdict hearing.</p>
<p>The appeals process in these kinds of cases generally only involves lawyers consideration of the original first instance and appeals court judgements alongside trial witness testimony, cross examination materials, closing statements, appeal materials and all other trial evidence. In all but very exceptional circumstances no new court hearings are held nor is additional witness testimony or case evidence presented.</p>
<p>An appeal to the Supreme Court in Thailand after an Appeals Court judgement is usually decided within 2-5 years. So a verdict of the Supreme Court on Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo's final appeal in this case could perhaps be expected no earlier than 2018 but perhaps much later.</p>
<p>Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo to be detained in a high security detention facility commensurate to the death penalty imposed on them in the near future. As their situation post verdict has been deemed satisfactory, no additional security measures have been imposed on them and indeed security measures were reduced and shackles or other restraints already removed.</p>
<p>If after an appeal has been made the outcome is not satisfactory to Supreme Court, an appeal can no longer be made within Thailand's criminal justice system but pardon's can be granted under the Thai Consitution to those convicted on appeal.</p>

<p>·<span>  </span><i>15<sup>th</sup> Sept to 2<sup>nd</sup> Oct: </i>murder case investigations are conducted publicly in a chaotic manner. Conflicting disorganised police statements are given whereby key suspects change frequently from non-Thai friends of the deceased, Thai island based residents, speed boat drivers, influential Thai persons and Myanmar migrants. Police allege DNA testing on cigarettes found nearby the bodies of the deceased and semen found in the body of Hannah was crucial in finding those responsible. DNA samples taken from hundreds of persons, mostly migrants, living on Koh Tao or suspected of involvement in the murders.</p>
<p>·<span>  </span><i>18<sup>th</sup> Sept to 2<sup>nd</sup> Oct: </i>migrant workers on Koh Tao Island petition MWRN alleging physical and verbal abuse at the hands of Koh Tao case investigation officials.

<p>·<span>  </span><i>14<sup>th</sup> Oct: </i>KohSamui Court holds a preliminary witness hearing for 3 Myanmar prosecution witnesses at risk of disappearing. Zaw Lin/Wai Phyo attend, represented by lawyers from the Lawyers Council of Thailand (LCT). The witnesses testify: (1) Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were on Sairee Beach on 14<sup>th</sup> Sept. night close to the place where the bodies of Hannah and David were found; (2) Wai Phyo came across a mobile phone he said he found that may have belonged to David but passed it onto his friend.

<p>·<span>  </span><i>26<sup>th</sup> Dec:</i> at preliminary hearing, 18 full days witness testimony over 3 months agreed, starting from 8<sup>th</sup>July 2015. The court disallows this request but leaves open possibility of witness testimony given via video link from overseas or from Bangkok. When asked by the judge to again plead in relation to the charges, Zaw Lin/Wai Phyo insist they are innocent of all charges. When asked by the judge whether they know who was involved in the murders, both Zaw Lin/Wai Phyo say they know nothing about the murders and who was responsible as they were merely relaxing on Sairee beach that night and didn’t see or hear anything. The defence team presents to the court the valid passport of Zaw Lin to rebut charges of illegal entry into Thailand.</p>
<p>·<span>  </span><i>22<sup>nd</sup> April 2015: </i>The defense team submits formal request to Koh Samui court for sending to Ministry of Justice for re-examination key forensics evidence and for independent testing of the DNA profiles of the two accused</p>

The Migrant Worker Rights Network (MWRN) represents all migrant workers in Thailand. The MWRN aims to support and raise funds, with your vital assistance, for the defense and humanitarian supporting during imprisonment of Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo (Win Zaw Htun), two 22 year old Myanmar workers prosecuted and convicted with a death penalty applied on 24th Dec 2015 for the rape and murder of Hannah Witheridge and murder of David Miller, both British tourists, which occurred on Koh Tao Island, Thailand in Sept 2014.
 
The guilty verdict was given on December 24th 2015 when both Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were both found guilty of rape and murder and given the death sentence. The accused are currently on death row at Bang Kwang high security prison in Nonthaburi Province of Thailand near to Bangkok. On 23rd February 2017, Region 8 Appeals Court upheld the conviction and death penalty sentence against the two accused and this judgement is currently pending appeal by the defense team to Thailand's Supreme Court.
The appeals process for Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo against their verdict and sentencing is a long one. It was first to the Appeals Court (submitted in May 2016, 9-12 months was expected for verdict delivered in February 2017) and then on to the Supreme Court (2-5 years after original conviction expected for final verdict). The final appeal to the Supreme Court has now commenced with a team of lawyers from the Lawyers Council of Thailand working on the appeal alongside MWRN and a number of domestic and foreign criminal justice/crime scene/forensics experts. 
 
MWRN’s involvement in the Koh Tao murder case began in Oct 2014 amidst widespread allegations regarding:

Arrest of ‘scapegoats’.
Torture of Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo during detention prior to questioning by investigation officials.
Improper collection of forensic evidence during crime scene investigations.
Intimidation and abuse of witnesses and suspects

Guardian on Torture Allegations in Koh Tao Case
 
MWRN intends to contribute to a fair appeals process post conviction for Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo to prevent a potential miscarriage of justice that would impact negatively on families, communities and everyone deeply affected by this case. MWRN also wants to ensure that migrants, who contribute much through their work and presence to the prosperity of Koh Tao and to Thailand, will feel justice is achieved from this case. In addition to families and friends of all those concerned, Thailand’s migrant community has been deeply impacted and moved by the tragic deaths of Hannah and David and the arrest and prosecution of Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo, their fellow nationals, for the crime. The migrant community and those in Myanmar have rose up against the verdict and protests continue.
‘A fair appeals process for Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo is essential to ensure, with more confidence, that those guilty of this crime are held accountable and that there is no punishment of the wrong people. It would be a double injustice if  the lack of a legal defense team to carry out defense work effectively for Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo, meant that the real killers went free whilst innocent people were jailed, even executed. If Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo are innocent, no-one wants such a situation to arise. That’s why MWRN has set up this fund, to support some significant defense related costs in this case.’ - Ko Sein Htay, MWRN President/Fund Administrator
 
 Guardian on Concerns Over Koh Tao Fair Trial
Why Does MWRN Need YOU?
‘Now we have seen the light of hope for justice and truth as so many people have become involved in defending us and supporting our case.’ – Zaw Lin/Wai Phyo, Feb. 2015
In order to minimise risk of a miscarriage of justice, MWRN continues to publicly seek financial/other practical support to contribute our part of costs needed to cover all expenses, to ensure a fair trial through an effective appeals process for Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo. Expenses MWRN seek to contribute to now include:

Flights and travel costs for defense team members involved in attending meetings and planning sessions concerning the appeal of the convictions and sentencing and for visits to Bang Kwang Prison to meet with the accused during the appeals process
Travel/accommodation costs for expert advisors during the appeals process 
Prison support costs for Zaw Lin/Wai Phyo during continued detention in Bang Kwang Prison, including travel costs for prison visitors

It is important to note that all those working on the defense case (including lawyers, assistants, investigators, prison visitors, translators and campaigners) are doing so pro-bono or free of charge. Fundraising only seeks to cover expenses. The Lawyers Council of Thailand is also supporting some of the defense team by covering basic expenses for main practicing lawyers.MWRN previously raised 812, 000 Thai Baht (around US$25, 000) to assist the defense of Wai Phyo and Zaw Lin in late 2014. These funds were exhausted during the emergency and initial stages of the defense engagement. Youcaring website unexpectedly, and without notice, withdrew MWRN's 'Justice: Koh Tao Case' fundraiser from its site in January 2015, claiming a sudden change of website regulations to disallow criminal defense fundraisers. This is why MWRN launched this an urgent trial preparation STAGE TWO two fundraiser with Indiegogo. Within 48 days of starting this 60 day campaign, MWRN met our £10,000 modest fundraising target and our campaign moved into InDemand to allow us to keep up the push for further donations to make our work more effective (for updates on the spending of all MWRN raised funds, please see the updates section of this site). MWRN has now raised a total of over 2 million baht for this case defence of which almost all funds have been exhausted during the trial and first instance appeals process, The fundraiser now moves into STAGE THREE for the Supreme Court appeals process and for continued humanitarian support to the 2 convicted men. 

 OUR Challenges  
 
‘Before and during the case investigation we had no chance to speak out on our innocence or the truth. We are victims of influential people.' – Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo’s message written in court on 26th Dec. 2014
Our challenge is to achieve justice in this carefully monitored case, whilst working within the boundaries of the Thai judicial system, with its pride and reputation at stake. There is also the challenge of the on-going situation of powerlessness, discrimination and exploitation faced by migrant workers in Thailand. Genuine justice is obtained through ensuring the equality of resources for both the prosecution and defense teams. It is essential that the defense team has the resources to appeal their case and prepare and appeal to the best of their ability, to ensure that two innocent young men are not convicted and possibly executed for these murders. In this worse case scenario, there would be no justice for Hannah and David and those who loved them, but only two more innocent victims in this very disturbing and important trial.
Guardian on Complaints Against UK Government 
Guardian on UK Government Protest Koh Tao Case Investigation
 

The defense team, consisting of pro bono lawyers associated with the Lawyers Council of Thailand and assisted by rights activists, face an exceptional challenge. More than a hundred witnesses and a thousand pages of statements/forensic case related evidence was put forward in this case and had to be understood. 21 days of trial testimony by 34 witnesses and more than a thousand pages of a prosecution file needs to be reviewed again for the appeals process, as well as the new appeals court judgement and prosecution submissions made as part of this process, All appeals processes are conducted in the Thai language and must then be translated into the Burmese and English language. Even more financial and practical constraints are faced in working with experts outside of Thailand, to prevent a miscarriage of justice.

Koh Tao Case Background
 
   
 
In the early morning of 15th September 2014, two young British tourists Hannah Witheridge (23) and David Miller (24) were murdered on Koh Tao, a popular tourist destination in the Gulf of Thailand. The two victim’s bodies were reportedly found amongst rocks in a secluded area of the popular Sairee Beach.
Two weeks into the murder investigation, police had yet to charge anyone with the murders. Amidst conflicting statements regarding evidence and suspects, the investigation appeared increasingly disorganised.
Investigators of this case have been criticised for the alleged mishandling of forensic evidence, abuse of suspects and intimidation of witnesses, particularly migrant workers living on Koh Tao.
A huge shadow has been cast, not only over the safety of tourism, but also over the reliability of the criminal justice system in Thailand, to hold someone responsible for these high profile murders. 
Whilst under pressure to make an arrest, Thai officials suggested that migrant workers committed these murders. For many, these statements reflected the historical and systematic discrimination long faced by migrant workers in Thailand. Migrant workers are still frequent victims of abuse and extortion by Thai law enforcement officials. They are consistently treated like second-class citizens, with little access to effective justice, remedies or any complaint mechanisms.
Blanket DNA testing of the migrant community was then undertaken amidst fears that the migrant community would be persecuted as ‘scapegoats’ for these murders, as a result of their powerlessness to fight back. Shortly after the murders, migrant workers on Koh Tao began to petition MWRN with video and photographic evidence alleging physical and verbal abuse by investigation officials during questionings. Migrant communities throughout Thailand also communicated to MWRN their concerns that Thai authorities would unfairly scapegoat Myanmar migrant workers for these horrific murders.

 The Arrest of Zaw Lin and Wei Phyo
 
Thai police detained Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Htun (Wai Phyo), two young Myanmar migrant workers from the impoverished Rakhine State in the far West of Myanmar, on 2nd October 2014. Zaw Lin (21) worked at Brother Bar and Wai Phyo (21) worked at Safety Stop restaurant on Koh Tao at the time of the murders.
Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo’s purpose in Thailand was to send money home to support their parents and siblings living in poverty in Myanmar. Both had been working on Koh Tao for several years.

Zaw Lin and Wei Phyo’s Claims of Innocence 
 
 
During the initial weeks of detention in Koh Samui prison, Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were permanently shackled and confined to a high security cell 24 hours a day, only being allowed out to meet with authorised visitors. Prison authorities justified this treatment based on suicide risks and the potential danger both supposedly posed to fellow prisoners. Following complaints by rights groups, Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were eventually unshackled and allowed to join other prisoners outside of their cell during daytime hours only.
Several days after being arrested, Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo told human rights monitors at Koh Samui prison that they were abused and tortured following detention, prior to being handed over to investigation officials. A week later, both pleaded innocence to rights lawyers organised for them. Both alleged their heads were covered with bags to imitate suffocation, while they were also threatened with electrocution, burning and execution to elicit confessions. Misconduct of translators assisting investigators was also alleged.
‘We are poor, so we came to Thailand to work and save money…In the beginning when we arrived in Thailand we suffered many difficulties, we do not want to be suffering like poor people and we tried to work hard and sent money back to our parents regularly, we were happy so much for that. But now our hopes are broken. We are worried about our parents, who will support them? And we miss our parents every day, when we miss them we are crying…’ – Zaw Lin and Wei Phyo’s letter to Aung San Suu Kyi, Dec. 2014

The Formal Charges and Not Guilty Pleas
Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were officially arraigned on 4th and 8th December 2014 at Koh Samui Court by the Koh Samui prosecutor's office. The charges levied against them included: killing the two deceased intentionally; killing Hannah to cover up her rape and to avoid punishment; raping and assaulting Hannah with violent acts; being non-Thai nationals entering into Thailand irregularly and remaining in Thailand irregularly; and Wei Phyo is charged alone with theft of a mobile phone and a pair of sunglasses, both allegedly belonging to David Miller. Both Zaw Lin and Wei Phyo pleaded not guilty to all the charges filed against them.
Guardian on Formal Charges‘We are not perfect and the best sons in our families, but we wish to remind everyone we did not commit this cunning and barbarian crime.’ – Zaw Lin and Wei Phyo, Feb 2015 
UK Government Case Investigation
 
There followed intense media coverage and public concern which was expressed in the form of online campaigns regarding the reliability of the Thai police investigation and the arrest of Zaw Lin and Wei Phyo. UK Prime Minister David Cameron and UK authorities strongly engaged Thai officials. Officials from the UK sought to send a team of qualified British police to Thailand to investigate the murders and report back to the deceased’s families. Since this time, MWRN and Zaw Lin and Wei Phyo’s defense team have been working with Reprieve in London to explore the UK Government’s role in investigating this case. This led to disclosure of a Metropolitan Police letter dated 19th December 2014 that stated in summary:

The Metropolitan police did not conduct any investigations into these murders in Thailand. Instead, during a visit to Thailand in November 2014, three UK police officials were granted observer status only to limited parts of the Thai police investigation, they did not provide any advice or assistance, and relied on the translation services of a Thai police translator. During their visit these officials did not take possession of any evidence, physical or forensic, and did not collect exhibits, interviews or statements
The Metropolitan police were preparing a report on observations from their visit to Thailand, to be completed in January 2015. This report was to be for internal use only and would not be shared with the Thai authorities or other persons. Furthermore, the request from the defense team to review this report was denied as, relying on an exemption under the UK data protection law, it would ‘clearly prejudice’ the criminal prosecution in question and undermine prevention and detection of crime 
No other case information would be shared with Thai authorities or the defense team by UK authorities for use in a criminal process which lacks the necessary assurances regarding use of the death penalty

The validity of this Metropolitan Police response was under question after further investigations by MWRN and the defense team, which has uncovered an acknowledgement by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) that there may have been informal sharing of UK based witness statements by local police forces with Thai authorities despite concerns over whether necessary assurances regarding the death penalty were first obtained by the concerned authorities. There were also issues surrounding sharing information on the case related mobile phone. A High Court London challenge for the accused to get advance disclosure of the Metropolitan Police report on the UK investigation into their case, prosecuted by an expert team of UK Human Rights Lawyers and with assistance from Reprieve, was rejected by the court on the grounds of national security.

Koh Tao Murder Case Trial
Prosecution witness hearings were set as 8th-10th Jul, 22nd-24th Jul, 18th-21st Aug and 27th-28th Aug. Defence witness hearings days were set as 1st-2nd Sept and 22nd-25th Sept. An extra day of witness testimony was allowed on 11th Sept. The verdict in the case was agreed on as 24th Dec 2015. 
 
Flaws in the Investigation Highlight During Trial
A 21-day trial eventually commenced on 8th July 2015, with 3 days extension granted in the hearings, involving 34 witnesses and thousands of pages of evidence has already been widely publicised by media.
The closing statement considered the testimony of the prosecution witnesses so as to compare the reliability of this witness testimony alongside that of the defence witnesses also for the court’s benefit in issuing a judgement on the case. The statement highlighted as follows:
1. The case questioning and charging of the accused prior to prosecution was unlawful. The accused questioning after arrest and the process of notifying them of the charges against them were incorrect. The accused were questioned without lawyers or trusted persons present. The accused were not read their rights as criminal suspects or explained the nature of offences they were charged with. Neither of the accused were provided with adequate translation and legal representation as required by law. The accused’s DNA samples were taken from them involuntarily and are hence inadmissible as evidence in court.
2. The accused’s original confessions during questioning cited by the prosecution in court came about involuntarily from torture or abuse that made them fear for their lives. These written confessions, even if they had been signed, should not be considered by the Court. Other documents that were also written for the accused and which they involuntarily signed without understanding them, likewise shouldn’t be considered by the court. The videoed or staged re-enactments undertaken by the accused and submitted by the prosecution to the Court were likewise involuntary, staged under threat of violence and shouldn’t be considered or should be inadmissible as evidence in court. 
3. There is no link between the alleged murder weapon (a hoe) and the accused. DNA samples from the hoe don’t match the accused DNA profiles but instead match the DNA profiles of other individuals. 
4. The DNA evidence allegedly matching the accused as well as all surrounding or circumstantial evidence in this case apparently showing the guilt of the accused is unreliable and should be inadmissible and not considered by the Court. All of this evidence was not collected, tested or analysed in accordance with internationally accepted standards such as ISO 17025. This evidence should not be considered as satisfying beyond reasonable doubt that the accused violently raped and murdered the female deceased or murdered the male deceased. This includes all evidence linking the accused to the alleged crime scene such as cigarette butts, theft of the male deceased’s mobile phone and sunglasses as well as a ‘running man’ caught on CCTV. 
5. The prosecution case is marked by an absence of significant evidence needed to prove the guilt of the accused for crimes they are charged with. This absent evidence includes photographs of the crime scene, autopsy and DNA analysis processes, chain of custody documents for forensic evidence, certain forensic evidence documents as well as detailed DNA analysis laboratory case notes. In addition, the clothes and the body surface of the female deceased expected to contain significant traces of DNA of the perpetrators were either not tested at all or tested but not included in the prosecution file or case evidence list. CCTV footage provided by the prosecution seemed to be incomplete and no fingerprint or footprint evidence was presented as part of the prosecution case.
The conclusion of the closing statement was the opinion of the two accused in calling for the Court to issue a judgement on 24th December 2015 dismissing all the charges against them.
The Guilty Verdict
On the morning of December 24th Wai Phyo and Zaw Lin were found guilty of the murder of David Miller and Hannah Witheridge and sentenced to death. They each received additional 20 year sentences for the rape of Ms Witheridge and were also found guilty of seeking to cover up their crimes, for robbery and immigration offences .
Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were transferred to death row in Nakhon Si Thammarat high security prison on 26th December where they will remain confined to their cell 24/7 for the first month of incarceration and in shackles for four months. At night the small cell holds 61 prisoners. It is unclear whether these restraint mechanisms will be eased as officials suggested would be the case.
The Appeal
 
Koh Tao defence team and MWRN respectfully disagree that the case against the accused was not proven beyond reasonable doubt. We take the clear position that the collection, analysis & reporting of forensic case materials didn't meet international standards. Crucial DNA analysis in the case was poorly presented to the court, no evidence was available that this collection or analysis complied with ISO 17025 standards. No full chain of custody documents given to court which ruled out defence's trust in conducting re-testing of whatever samples provided for retesting. The fact the Court ruled that the prosecution case and investigation or analysis was of an international standard will be strongly challenged on appeal by the defence, as outlined above.
THE APPEALS PROCEDUREThe lengthy process begins of drafting, debating and finalising Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo's written appeal against both the judgement and sentencing verdict of the first instance Court to the Appeals Court and now the Region 8 Court of appeal.
The full Samui Court judgement is translated into English language by volunteers for sharing with the defence team's foreign advisors and forensic/CSI/DNA experts to get their important feedback on the judgement to support the defence team further in drafting the defendants appeal. The Region 8 Appeals Court verdict upholding this original conviction is currently being translated also.
Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo's written appeal to the First Instance Appeals Court was submitted in May 2016. The written appeal to the Supreme Court, following an upholding of their original conviction by the Appeals Court on 23rd February 2017, should be submitted within 30 days but appeal submission extension requests beyond 30 days can be requested by lawyers and are usually granted. In this case an extension request is likely by defence team lawyers given the significant amount of evidence amassed from a 21 day trial consisting of 34 witnesses testimony and 1000s of pages of submitted evidence and appeals documents, and given all the defence team are pro bono working on this case alongside other existing commitments.
Region 8 Appeals Court in Surat Thani Province considered the convicted men's written appeal in this case, together with the written response to the defendant’s appeal that the prosecution submitted to the appeals court in October 2016 before ruling on the case. The Supreme Court will now consider the convicted men's new appeal in this case, together with any response to the defendant's appeal that the prosecution choses to submit to the Court before ruling on the case.
The Supreme Court will also consider all other evidence before it in making its judgement on the appeal, which will usually consist of the original first instance court and appeals court judgements, all related original trial and appeal materials (including the defence and prosecution witness testimonies, cross examinations, closing statement submissions, appeals submissions and all other written evidence, documents, and materials presented to the court by the prosecution and the defence).
The Supreme Court, after considering all these materials, will write and issue it's judgement/verdict on the case and sentencing and this written judgement should be passed on to be read by Koh Samui Court in a full court appeal verdict hearing.
The appeals process in these kinds of cases generally only involves lawyers consideration of the original first instance and appeals court judgements alongside trial witness testimony, cross examination materials, closing statements, appeal materials and all other trial evidence. In all but very exceptional circumstances no new court hearings are held nor is additional witness testimony or case evidence presented.
An appeal to the Supreme Court in Thailand after an Appeals Court judgement is usually decided within 2-5 years. So a verdict of the Supreme Court on Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo's final appeal in this case could perhaps be expected no earlier than 2018 but perhaps much later.
Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo to be detained in a high security detention facility commensurate to the death penalty imposed on them in the near future. As their situation post verdict has been deemed satisfactory, no additional security measures have been imposed on them and indeed security measures were reduced and shackles or other restraints already removed.
If after an appeal has been made the outcome is not satisfactory to Supreme Court, an appeal can no longer be made within Thailand's criminal justice system but pardon's can be granted under the Thai Consitution to those convicted on appeal.

<p>Being honest, this campaign says we need 500 euros because it is the minimum required by IndieGogo, but with just 10 euros we can  create ads about the posts of the page, so any donation will have a great impact...</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With your help we can reach thousands of people who probably don't know what's happening in Catalonia, and we will make them know the truth and know the repressive and fascist attitude of the Spanish Government.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>OK, so not everyone can afford to donate, but you can still help us:</p>
<p>· Get out the word about the Catalan cause. Spread the word, join our Facebook group, ""like"" our Facebook page, follow us on Twitter, etc.</p>
<p>· Contribute to the debate! If you're a proud supporter of the democratic pro-independence movement you can attend demonstrations, talk to your family, friends and neighbours - don't be afraid to get the word out.</p>
</div></div>","Short Summary
We're a small grassroots group, made up of pro-indy Catalans and Scots living in both nations. We feel it is important to give a voice to those of us who support freedom for our nations, because we wish to see Scotland and Catalonia governed by the people who care most about our future. And that's why we need to spread the word and get more supporters!

<h3>Rainbow Honor Walk A Sidewalk Tribute</h3>
<p></p>
<p><u>Mission Statement</u>: 
The Rainbow Honor Walk seeks to honor the heroes and
heroines of the LGBT communities through a sidewalk tribute with bronze plaques in San Francisco’s
historic Castro district.  </p>
<p><u>Legacy and Visibility</u>:  This is an ongoing project, much like the
Hollywood Walk of Fame, it will continue indefinitely (as long as the Castro
District has sidewalks).  The area covered
is approximately 2.5 miles of sidewalk and includes two blocks of 19<sup>th</sup>
Street, two blocks of 18<sup>th</sup> Street, Castro Street from 19<sup>th</sup>
to Market Streets, and Market Street from Castro Street to the LGBT Center at
Market and Gough Street.  The Rainbow
Honor Walk will become another icon of the City of San Francisco generating
tourist traffic and breathing new life into the Castro District sidewalks.  Millions of people will be excited and
inspired by the honorees.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Our Budget</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>The plaques are 3 feet by 3 feet and will be acid etched into
bronze.  The cost of each plaque
is approximately $5,000.  Installation of the first twenty plaques will be donated by the San
Francisco Department of Public Works. 
The Rainbow Honor Walk is an all volunteer board which meets in donated
space by Zephyr Real Estate in the Castro.

<p>Menstrual Hygiene management
continues to be a critical issue for Young girls in farming, rural and peri
urban communities in Zimbabwe.  Reports
in media over the past four years and recently during the commemoration of
menstrual hygiene day on May 28 2014, paint a very sad picture on what girls
have to endure on a monthly basis.These
reports indicate that at least 62 % of girls in Zimbabwe are using very
unhygienic materials likes leaves, cow dung and dirty rags during their menstruation.  At least 20% of the girls miss school every month during their
monthly menstruation period.</p>

However, we want to make sure that this is a full funded and supported role, not just a symbolic post.   We are looking to answer three main questions;
What powers will the new Minister have when creating foreign policy?
How will the new department be funded?
What will be the priorities of this new department?
We are looking to raise £2500 so we can create our well researched and fully comprehensive report into the role and responsibilities that the new minister will have. If we do reach our stretch target of £3000, we will use the extra £500 to send a copy to every MP in the UK.For your support and donations, we will write to you thanking you from our office, as well as sending out pens and copies of the report. Our biggest donors will be invited to meet our team in our London office as well as having a guided tour of Parliament with one of our supporting MPs.We truly believe that this report could help change the way our Government views the new Minister and his role in contributing to peaceful solutions. By supporting us, you not only help us but you also show our Government that you care about a strong Minister for Peace and Disarmament who is able to influence foreign policy for the better.",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

</div><p></p><h3>Summary</h3><ul>
<li>For the 2nd year in a row we are raising funds to sponsor/subsidize summer camp for Refugee and Foster Children in Ukraine.</li>
<li>There's never been a more important time for what Ruka Dopomogy does in Ukraine. Because of the ongoing war with Russia in eastern Ukraine young people are searching for hope for their future.  Since January 2014 the Ukrainian currency (Hryvnia) has dropped dramatically against the US Dollar (from 8:1 to more than 30:1 at one point) yet <b>income has not increased <i>at all</i>!</b> As a result, summer camp, especially for vulnerable children such as those displaced by the war in the east, is a financial impossibility!</li>
<li>Igor Minenko is President of Ruka Dopomogy, an 18 year old Ukrainian Charity Fund (non-profit). RD has trained hundreds of youth workers in churches all over Ukraine how to build Jesus Focused Youth Ministries.  Before leading RD, he was the youth pastor at one of the largest youth ministries in Kiev.  Under his leadership Ruka Dopomogy has sponsored Summer Youth &amp; Children Camps in western Ukraine since 2010. He also serves as the Director of Youth Alpha Course in Ukraine.</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need</h3><ul>
<li> <b>One week of Summer Camp will cost $31.50 USD</b>. We want to provide a 50% subsidy for Foster Children and a 75% subsidy for Refugee Children and we are planning for 50 of each during our three weeks of summer camps.  Two years ago a week of summer camp cost approximately 200 Hryvnia  (about $25 USD at the time).  Not expensive, right? Today, that same $25.00 USD = about 600 UAH, and <b>remember, Ukrainian wages have <i>NOT </i>increased. </b>The kids and families we work with, especially displaced children and their families c<i>annot afford</i> a three or four fold increase. For the amount of money your teenager will spend on snacks and fast food <i>on the way to camp</i>, you can sponsor a Ukrainian Child or Teenager for a week of camp. </li>
<li>Our camp is small but awesome! Our capacity is only about 60 kids per week and because of time limitations at our venue we can only host 3 camps. Expenses are low because facilities are shockingly sparse and Staff pay their own way. There are no salaries! 85% of your donation (85% of $37.00 = $31.50) will sponsor a week of camp for a child or teenager. 15% will be shared with International Teams-US, our parent ministry/US 501c3 based in Elgin, Illinois and cover the cost of using Indigogo and/or Paypal.</li>
<li>Our goal of $2500 will subsidize camp cost for 50 refugee children and 50 foster children. Last summer more than half of the kids in our three camps were refugee and foster children.  If we raise more than our goal then International Teams and Ruka Dopomogy will help fund additional ministries with refugee and at-risk children.</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><ul>
<li>Many of the kids we're ministering with are facing an uncertain future. Many of them have fled their homes in war torn eastern Ukraine and may not ever return. They are stressed and their parents are stressed. You contribution will give them a week of respite in the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains. They'll sleep in tents, they'll hike the mountains, swim the river, and sing around campfires. They'll practice English, they'll play games and participate in competitions. They'll hear the Gospel every day and they'll be loved and cared for by veteran youth workers from among the churches Ruka Dopomogy has trained.</li>
<li>2016 is the sixth year of our camping ministry. Up until two summers ago we were seeing a lot of ""repeat"" kids from the churches we've coached. Beginning last summer we started receiving children and teens who were displaced by the war; the need is even greater this summer.</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>Camp Staff</h3><ul><li>Our camps are staffed with full-time workers from International Teams and Ruka Dopomogy Staff along with volunteers from local and participating churches. </li></ul><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><ul>
<li>Spread the word for us through email and all forms of social media.</li>
<li>Pray for us.</li>
<li>You can donate through Indiegogo to our US parent organization, International Teams. You can also give via Paypal directly to Igor Minenko's account (<a href=""http://www.paypal.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.paypal.com</a> to ""iminenko@ukr.net"").</li>

RD has trained hundreds of youth workers in churches all over Ukraine how to build Jesus Focused Youth Ministries.  Before leading RD, he was the youth pastor at one of the largest youth ministries in Kiev.  Under his leadership Ruka Dopomogy has sponsored Summer Youth & Children Camps in western Ukraine since 2010. He also serves as the Director of Youth Alpha Course in Ukraine.
What We Need
 One week of Summer Camp will cost $31.50 USD. We want to provide a 50% subsidy for Foster Children and a 75% subsidy for Refugee Children and we are planning for 50 of each during our three weeks of summer camps.  Two years ago a week of summer camp cost approximately 200 Hryvnia  (about $25 USD at the time).  Not expensive, right? Today, that same $25.00 USD = about 600 UAH, and remember, Ukrainian wages have NOT increased. The kids and families we work with, especially displaced children and their families cannot afford a three or four fold increase. For the amount of money your teenager will spend on snacks and fast food on the way to camp, you can sponsor a Ukrainian Child or Teenager for a week of camp. 
Our camp is small but awesome! Our capacity is only about 60 kids per week and because of time limitations at our venue we can only host 3 camps. Expenses are low because facilities are shockingly sparse and Staff pay their own way. There are no salaries! 85% of your donation (85% of $37.00 = $31.50) will sponsor a week of camp for a child or teenager. 15% will be shared with International Teams-US, our parent ministry/US 501c3 based in Elgin, Illinois and cover the cost of using Indigogo and/or Paypal.
Our goal of $2500 will subsidize camp cost for 50 refugee children and 50 foster children. Last summer more than half of the kids in our three camps were refugee and foster children.  If we raise more than our goal then International Teams and Ruka Dopomogy will help fund additional ministries with refugee and at-risk children.
The Impact
Many of the kids we're ministering with are facing an uncertain future. Many of them have fled their homes in war torn eastern Ukraine and may not ever return. They are stressed and their parents are stressed. You contribution will give them a week of respite in the foothills of the Carpathian Mountains. They'll sleep in tents, they'll hike the mountains, swim the river, and sing around campfires. They'll practice English, they'll play games and participate in competitions. They'll hear the Gospel every day and they'll be loved and cared for by veteran youth workers from among the churches Ruka Dopomogy has trained.
2016 is the sixth year of our camping ministry. Up until two summers ago we were seeing a lot of ""repeat"" kids from the churches we've coached. Beginning last summer we started receiving children and teens who were displaced by the war; the need is even greater this summer.
Camp StaffOur camps are staffed with full-time workers from International Teams and Ruka Dopomogy Staff along with volunteers from local and participating churches. Other Ways You Can Help
Spread the word for us through email and all forms of social media.
Pray for us.

<h3>a little about project outpour</h3>
<p>we exist to fight a simple yet significant issue in charlotte – the lack of access to showers and toilets for men and women who are moving through homelessness by putting a mobile shower unit on our streets. why? it’s simple. dignity matters and is a very real desire of every single person, regardless of circumstance.</p>
<p>think about how good you feel after a shower. we bet you feel recharged, refreshed, confident and ready to tackle the day. regardless of circumstance, every person deserves to feel uplifted.</p>
<p>we will literally set up shop on the streets. our customized shower trailer is 20 feet long and comes complete with two private bathrooms – one of which that’s slightly larger to accommodate families and persons with disabilities. each bathroom has its own sink, mirror, toilet and shower. guests are given 15 minutes, and we provide them with any supplies they may need. </p>

</div>
</div><div>
<h3>what we need &amp; where your donation goes</h3>
<p>we sent our down payment to a speciality trailer company in chicago so our mobile shower unit is being built right this minute. we are raising $20,000 and here's where that money will go:</p>
<ul>
<li>the remaining balance for the trailer.</li>
<li>comprehensive insurance for the truck and trailer.</li>
<li>supplies - we will be supplying all the usual shower suspects (shampoo, conditioner, soap, towels, etc.) but things like nail clippers, underwear, feminine products, etc, are needed too.</li>
</ul>
<p>when we exceed our campaign goal (not if but when, right?!), that money will help support operational expenses (fuel, staff to drive the truck and set up shop, security, permits, etc). we're hoping to have a truck donated (that will pull that trailer) but if not, funding from this campaign will help us purchase a gently used pickup.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>the impact</h3>
<p>according to mecklenburg county’s point in time count report, 1,668 people identified themselves as homeless in mecklenburg county in 2018 (up 13% from 2017). we will be able to meet them, literally, where they are, with our mobile shower trailer.</p>
<p>many of the men and women we know who are homeless will tell you that a shower is the difference between setting up an interview or not; is the difference between landing that job; is the difference between keeping that job. we feel opportunities present themselves when people are treated with dignity. we feel something as basic as a shower can be a catalyst for change in the lives of those we serve.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>risks &amp; challenges</h3>
<p>believe it or not, the biggest challenge is water disposal. we won't bore you with the details of black water and gray water but trust us, you don't want those dumped just anywhere. we are working with charlotte water to work through all of those details. </p>
<p>we've also had to overcome naysayers or people who don't think a shower is a big deal. our response to that - dignity is a basic human right, and so is regular access to clean water to maintain one's hygiene. some of the push back has come from people concerned a shower isn't ""enough."" we will serve as a safe place for men and women moving through homelessness and  we will serve as connectors. that's what makes our model so cool - while our guests are waiting to shower, we have the opportunity to engage them in authentic connection to discern their greater needs. through those connections, we'll be able to direct them to resources in the city to get them on a greater path of self-sufficiency and ultimately, housing.</p>

<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We are an open and diverse network of Armed Forces veterans who support Independence for Scotland and will work with others to achieve this aim.</p>
<p>We are a broad-based campaigning group who plan to LISTEN to Scotland's veterans. We aim to ensure veterans are involved in the democratic process, in the independence debate.</p>
<p>We will ensure that there will be a space for veterans’ voices and interests in the campaign. Independence will create opportunities for veterans to engage in developing a fully democratic vision for Scotland’s future.</p>
<p>Why?  Because veterans have a vote and their voice needs to be heard in the debate. </p>
<p> Most importantly, it gives us a real opportunity to listen to other veterans, to hear why they might not be supporting independence just yet, and to set out what it might mean for them.</p>
<p>The point of it all? To persuade more Veterans and civilians in Scotland to support independence.</p>

But WE can help Edson to defend his human rights by chipping in to cover the costs of his Judicial Review of the Quebec Human Rights Commission’s decision that rejected his case after conducting a very problematic investigation. Because of this problematic decision, Edson has retained support from CRARR, a local civil rights group, to help him go to court to obtain justice.</p>

<p class=""Body1""><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p class=""Body1"">In July 2011, AGIR Board Member and Photographer Edson Garcia was refused an apartment in a housing co-op located in the Gay Village. After Edson became a member of the co-op, the board of directors refused Edson’s application during the housing allocation process. One co-op board member claimed that Edson was refused due to aggressive behaviour during the selection interview. Edson disagrees with this claim and believes that the co-op disregarded the fact that he was diagnosed with a psychological condition which under the Charter, is a form of mental handicap, a ground of prohibited discrimination. Furthermore, Edson possesses evidence that one reason for the denial of his housing application is his being on social assistance at the time, even though he could meet his rental obligations as a future co-op member.</p>
<p class=""Body1"">The human rights commission dismissed Edson’s complaint after conducting an investigation that, among other things, failed to examine the co-op’s record of renting to people with disabilities, which is non-existent.</p>
<p class=""Body1"">In his desire to protect his civil rights, Edson has decided to file a judicial review of the Commission’s decision because of serious errors of fact.</p>
<p class=""Body1"">Fortunately, the Centre for Research Action on Race Relations (CRARR) has decided to assist Edson. CRARR is a non-profit civil rights organization committed to promoting racial and other forms ofequality by supporting victims of discrimination through activities involving advocacy, research and legal representation.

<p class=""Body1"">Edson’s Judicial Review involves major costs and fees that usually discourages people with limited income from accessing justice in Quebec (court and bailiff fees alone are almost $300; photocopies and supplies can easily cost $150). CRARR has very kindly taken on Edson’s case at practically no costs (pro bono), but it would be great if we could fundrais to help support Edson with his case. This would go towards the cost of the judicial review and provide a small donation to CRARR and its partners for its research and other services.</p>
<p class=""Body1"">Edson joined the AGIR board at our last AGM in July 2011 and since then, he has tirelessly been involved in numerous AGIR initiatives.

<p>International Symposium
against Isolation</p>
<p>
</p><p>For 12 years now, the
International Platform against Isolation is organizing international
symposias in different countries of Europe, in order to bring
together movements, solidarity campaign groups, NGO's, intellectuals
and people of all nationalities on the base of struggle against
Isolation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This project was brought
to life in the long period of resistance against prison isolation,
which had been continued by the political prisoners in Turkey over 7
years in total, defending their human rights with long term hunger
strikes (death fasts).</p>
<p>Also hear an amazing song
produced by Irish protest singer Pol Mac Adaim, dedicated to the
resistance in F-type jails in Turkey:
<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2QB-7TF8HU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2QB-7TF8HU</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It was very obvious that
isolation was not only a policy used behind the prison walls, but
also as a means in the world outside to silence system critical
voices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our symposias therefore
dealed with isolation in a larger context, from the prisons to the
struggle of  social and political movements, from media censorship to
the occupations, blockades and war crimes in many parts of the world.</p>

against Isolation

For 12 years now, the
International Platform against Isolation is organizing international
symposias in different countries of Europe, in order to bring
together movements, solidarity campaign groups, NGO's, intellectuals
and people of all nationalities on the base of struggle against
Isolation.

This project was brought
to life in the long period of resistance against prison isolation,
which had been continued by the political prisoners in Turkey over 7
years in total, defending their human rights with long term hunger
strikes (death fasts).
Also hear an amazing song
produced by Irish protest singer Pol Mac Adaim, dedicated to the
resistance in F-type jails in Turkey:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x2QB-7TF8HU

It was very obvious that
isolation was not only a policy used behind the prison walls, but
also as a means in the world outside to silence system critical
voices.

Our symposias therefore
dealed with isolation in a larger context, from the prisons to the
struggle of  social and political movements, from media censorship to
the occupations, blockades and war crimes in many parts of the world.

Our first aim is to create
and coordinate the solidarity and unity among the peoples and
organizations, to promote the efforts or common actions on
international level and to built up thematical groups, as for
instance exchange between progressive lawyers, the relatives of
prisoners in different countries and also between political prisoners
themselves.

We have organized already
11 symposias, being joined by wonderful people from all continents,
building a bridge between intellectuals, artists and political
activists for a common goal: Struggle for human dignity, freedom and
justice.

While our earlier
symposias were held in Noordwijk (Holland), Florence (Italy), Paris
(France), Vienna (Austria), Brussels (Belgium), London (UK), Athens
(Greece), Berlin (Germany) and Amsterdam (Holland), we decided this
time to move towards the Arab world, namely to Beirut in Lebanon.

We want to come closer to
the heart of the conflict to discuss with peoples of the region about
our role to support the people in their tragedies of life, which were
brought by the wars of profit.

To realize all this, means
a lot of costs. There are many groups and persons involved, mainly
from economically weak regions. This means huge travel expenses,
infrastructure as meeting place, translation equipment, hosting, food
and many others.

We always tried to find a
way to manage, but in these times it's getting harder to find
support. The fact, that the location of our symposias is changing
every year, makes it even more difficult to get stable funds.Here is the programme of the Symposium: Dates of

</p><p><b>About the Colombia New Horizons Foundation</b></p>
<p>Over the last seven years, the Colombia New Horizons
Foundation has helped more than 3000 victims of Colombia’s armed conflict. Most
of these people have been single mothers and their children. The Foundation
was borne from the personal experiences of its founder, Marino Rivera, who was
displaced <span><span>by FARC guerrillas </span></span>from his native city of Florencia in the south of the country, where
he worked as a school administrator. He arrived to Bogotá,
the country’s capital, without any support or money and was forced to panhandle and
sleep in the streets. After a month of living in the streets, Marino found his
way to a shelter where he stayed for six months, until it was closed by its
director. Marino then decided to organize the other displaced persons there and
to open a new shelter for themselves and the thousands of families that arrive
every day to the city, dispossessed from their lands by the violence that
wracks the country.</p>
<p>When he first started the Foundation, Marino rented two
bedrooms and a single bathroom to be shared by up to 30 people. Today, the
foundation is located in a four story house, with five shared bedrooms and
bathrooms, and ample room for up to fifty people.</p><p> The Foundation offers displaced families
temporary room and board, clothes, psychological support and legal guidance. The Foundation is sustained entirely through individual donations. <br/></p><p>All services offered are absolutely free. <br/></p><p>For more information <a href=""http://colnuevoshorizontes.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">visit our website</a> or like us on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/FUNDACION-COLOMBIA-NUEVOS-HORIZONTES/138710749485519"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a><br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>About the Colombian Conflict and its Victims</b></p><p>After more than five decades of war between guerrillas, right-wing paramilitaries and the national army, Colombia has one of the gravest humanitarian crises in the world. The generalized violence, massacres, threats and intimidation have forced between 4.5 and 5 million people from their homes, making it the country with the highest internally displaced population in the world, according to the UN.</p><p> Even though the paramilitary groups struck a deal with the government and demobilized in 2006, they have morphed into sophisticated drug trafficking organizations that continue to terrorize and displace thousand of civilians. Likewise, the guerrillas have sought to enter into peace negotiations with the Colombian government, but no cease fire has been declared, and in many regions the violence has escalated. <br/></p><p>Last year, a quarter of a million people were displaced by the violence. They sought refuge in the country's larger cities and departmental capitals. Despite legislation aimed at providing displaced families with reparations, the state's aid network is not meeting the needs of these victims. Most of them struggle securing basic necessities, housing, food and health services. It is estimated that 85% of displaced Colombians live under conditions of extreme poverty. <br/></p><p>For more information visit: <br/></p><p><a href=""http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/page?page=49e492ad6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The UN Refugee Agency</a></p><p><a href=""http://www.trust.org/spotlight/Colombia-displacement/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Thompson Reuters Foundation - Colombia</a><br/></p><p></p></div>","Emergency Funds for Colombian War Refugees and their Farm$5,000 urgently needed to cover rent on organic farm project -- or non-profit that supports refugees will lose itYour support will help war refugees and New Horizons foundation (who spearheads this amazing project) in these ways:

the farm, and we have plans to scale up their use through better equipment. We
will have the help of a local agronomist who will be on staff training
displaced persons on sustainable farming techniques and will make sure our own practices are completely sustainable. With your help, the farm will break even within six months and will start turning a profit within the first year. 

About the Colombia New Horizons Foundation
Over the last seven years, the Colombia New Horizons
Foundation has helped more than 3000 victims of Colombia’s armed conflict. Most
of these people have been single mothers and their children. The Foundation
was borne from the personal experiences of its founder, Marino Rivera, who was
displaced by FARC guerrillas from his native city of Florencia in the south of the country, where
he worked as a school administrator. He arrived to Bogotá,
the country’s capital, without any support or money and was forced to panhandle and
sleep in the streets. After a month of living in the streets, Marino found his
way to a shelter where he stayed for six months, until it was closed by its
director. Marino then decided to organize the other displaced persons there and
to open a new shelter for themselves and the thousands of families that arrive
every day to the city, dispossessed from their lands by the violence that
wracks the country.
When he first started the Foundation, Marino rented two
bedrooms and a single bathroom to be shared by up to 30 people. Today, the
foundation is located in a four story house, with five shared bedrooms and
bathrooms, and ample room for up to fifty people. The Foundation offers displaced families
temporary room and board, clothes, psychological support and legal guidance. The Foundation is sustained entirely through individual donations. All services offered are absolutely free. For more information visit our website or like us on FacebookAbout the Colombian Conflict and its VictimsAfter more than five decades of war between guerrillas, right-wing paramilitaries and the national army, Colombia has one of the gravest humanitarian crises in the world. The generalized violence, massacres, threats and intimidation have forced between 4.5 and 5 million people from their homes, making it the country with the highest internally displaced population in the world, according to the UN. Even though the paramilitary groups struck a deal with the government and demobilized in 2006, they have morphed into sophisticated drug trafficking organizations that continue to terrorize and displace thousand of civilians. Likewise, the guerrillas have sought to enter into peace negotiations with the Colombian government, but no cease fire has been declared, and in many regions the violence has escalated. Last year, a quarter of a million people were displaced by the violence. They sought refuge in the country's larger cities and departmental capitals. Despite legislation aimed at providing displaced families with reparations, the state's aid network is not meeting the needs of these victims. Most of them struggle securing basic necessities, housing, food and health services. It is estimated that 85% of displaced Colombians live under conditions of extreme poverty.

<p>El 18 de Abril de 1975 en la ciudad de Monterrey, Nuevo León fue detenido-desaparecido por la Policía Judicial del Estado y la Dirección Federal de Seguridad (DFS, hoy conocido como CISEN: Centro de Investigación y Seguridad Nacional) Jesús Piedra Ibarra un joven estudiante de medicina de apenas 20 años de edad.  Desde entonces su familia, pero especialmente su madre, Rosario Ibarra de Piedra, se dio a la tarea de buscarlo y reclamarlo a las autoridades mexicanas. En esa búsqueda, Rosario  además de sufrir  el martirio angustiante de ignorar el paradero de su hijo tuvo que soportar largas antesalas en las dependencias gubernamentales encargadas de la impartición de justicia creyendo que cumplirían con el mandato constitucional   de salvaguardar los derechos ciudadanos;  pero al contrario, solo recibió respuestas evasivas negando la participación de sus policías en el secuestro de su hijo.  En estos recorridos agobiantes se encontró con otras mujeres  que también buscaban la presentación con vida de sus hijos o de algún familiar que fue detenido en forma similar y en circunstancias parecidas  por la policía política y/o las fuerzas armadas. Ante tanta complicidad e indolencia de las autoridades,  las familias vimos  que era necesario conformar un grupo organizado en cada estado del país donde  este crimen estaba sucediendo y con el cual pudiéramos emprender la lucha colectiva por la libertad de los nuestros y al mismo tiempo  defendernos de los embates represivos del gobierno, además de que las cárceles públicas ya se encontraban llenas de presos políticos, se habían girado innumerables órdenes de aprehensión para la disidencia y un buen número de hombres y mujeres habían tenido que abandonar el país y fue  entonces  que en abril de 1977 se constituyó en la ciudad de Monterrey el Comité Pro-Defensa de Presos, Perseguidos, Desaparecidos y Exiliados Políticos de México integrado sólo por las familias que en su mayoría eran las que buscaban a los desaparecidos; adquiriendo carácter nacional los días 7 y 8 de Agosto del mismo año. Hoy solo lo nombramos Comité ¡Eureka!.</p>
<p>Así se inició esta larga y difícil lucha que no ha sido en vano. A pesar de la desigualdad de la fuerza, cuando a nadie en México se le ocurría que era fundamental la lucha por los derechos humanos, cuando nadie se organizaba para su defensa, los familiares de los desaparecidos fuimos el motor de un gran movimiento, realizando marchas, mítines, huelgas de hambre, plantones, bloqueos y acciones de gran carga simbólica. Se logró que se aprobara una Ley de Amnistía en 1979 mediante la cual fueron liberados 1,500 presos políticos, 2,000 órdenes de aprehensión quedaron sin efecto, regresaron al país 57 exiliados y fue posible rescatar con vida a 148 personas que permanecían desaparecidas en cárceles clandestinas del mal gobierno.</p>
<p>Sin embargo, a la fecha, tenemos registrados 557 desapariciones forzadas en el periodo que comprende de 1969 hasta los últimos años de la década de los 90's.</p>
<p><strong> El Museo</strong></p>
<p>Surgimos hace 4 años y medio. Nuestro objetivo es mantener en la conciencia de todos la existencia de los desaparecidos, es nuestra forma de seguir luchando por los seres queridos que nos fueron arrebatados  y llevados a las cárceles clandestinas en campos militares y bases navales porque  creyeron que con el aletazo de la represión y el encierro borrarían todo vestigio de su existencia y que quedarían para siempre en la sombra del olvido.</p>
<p>El Estado mexicano al fraguar su plan siniestro se olvidó de la memoria; ¡sí! esa que ha sido nuestra arma y el obstáculo para todos aquellos que no se cansan de justificar a los victimarios frente a las víctimas. Esa memoria que es la única que puede salvar a la historia devolviéndole su moral y dignidad.</p>
<p>Por eso en el Museo Casa de la Memoria Indómita queremos que las generaciones presentes y futuras conozcan lo que ha sido la lucha por la vida y la libertad. Que comprendan que este arduo trabajo no admite reposo porque si detuviéramos nuestros pasos nos envileceríamos... pero esperanzados, porque no perdemos la fe en la humanidad, deseamos que quienes nos visiten salgan de este recinto con la firme convicción de erradicar de la faz de la tierra este aterrador crimen.</p>
<p>El mal gobierno de México en un hecho terrible y vergonzoso, fue el primero en América Latina en utilizar la Desaparición Forzada. <strong>Por eso hoy le damos mayor valor a la memoria como patrimonio universal</strong> mediante los documentos y las imágenes de todos estos seres queridos víctimas de de este crimen que nos llaman a continuar en resistencia.  El trabajo expuesto en este Museo  ha emanado de nuestro archivo, con la profunda convicción de poner al descubierto, la impunidad, la simulación, la corrupción y la injusticia que siguen transitando por todo el territorio nacional como nuevos jinetes del apocalipsis.</p>

Continue with all our activities such as temporary expositions, lectures and conferences, book presentations, study groups, forums, film and documentary screenings, music workshops, theatre, dance, et cetera… This is a living Museum! and an enclosure for citizens of all the world collaborate with us in the defense of human rights replacing the unilateral vision for a wide and diverse one that strengthens critical thinking.
We can work on the building's maintenance, such as the elimination of humidity in southern and western walls, waterproofing the roofs, habilitation and lighting of the upper room that will be converted in a multipurpose hall. We will open a library specializing in individual rights violations, and  a meeting and working hall. Because this is a historical building in Mexico City's downtown, the procedures will be made under the authority of the Instituto Nacional de Bellas Artes, or INBA (National Institute of Fine Arts).
 Risk of not achieving our goalTo achieve our goal will resolve several difficulties which impede us to fully accomplish our main function that is the permanent denunciation of Forced Disappearance and the impunity that prevails up to the day in all Mexico. Not achieving our goal would be another obstacle in this unequal fight, but there is no way that we will stop doing our labor.    ¡ALIVE THEY WERE TAKEN!  ¡ ALIVE WE WANT THEM BACK!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Qui sommes-nous?</strong></p>
<p>Nous sommes une organisation de solidarité fondée en 1976 qui travaille à la défense et à la promotion des droits humains en réciprocité avec les mouvements sociaux et les communautés d’Amérique latine dans la lutte en faveur d’une justice sociale, environnementale, économique et culturelle.</p>
<p>Les actions urgentes constituent le pilier du travail du CDHAL et c’est à travers celles-ci que nous entretenons des liens de réciprocité avec les mouvements sociaux et les groupes de base en Amérique latine. Nous effectuons un suivi de l’actualité d’Amérique latine et la diffusons au Québec et au Canada, recevons des demandes d’appuis des communautés et des mouvements sociaux, participons à de nombreuses campagnes de dénonciation, et rédigeons et traduisons des communiqués, déclarations et pétitions ayant pour objectif de faire pression pour des cas particuliers et de contribuer à l’éducation du public.</p>
<p>Les actions urgentes appuient nos allié.e.s d’Amérique latine en dénonçant auprès des gouvernements latino-américains et canadien des situations d’oppression, de répression et de violations des droits humains qui portent atteinte au droit à la vie et à un environnement sain, à l’autodétermination, à l’intégrité, à la sécurité et à la liberté des personnes ou groupes, au droit de se défendre, ainsi qu’à la criminalisation de la protestation sociale.</p>
<p>Cette campagne de sociofinancement vise à appuyer le programme des actions urgentes du CDHAL en permettant à l'équipe de poursuivre et d'étendre un suivi rigoureux des actions en cours. Le financement recueilli permettra aussi à l'équipe de se doter de moyens pour approfondir et alimenter la compréhension et l’analyse des enjeux sociaux, politiques et environnementaux auxquels nous nous intéressons à travers nos liens avec les mouvements sociaux latino-américains et les communautés affectées par les projets extractifs. </p>
<p>Le CDHAL est en contact et appuie une quinzaine de mouvements sociaux et groupes de base en Amérique latine, notamment le Mexique, Guatemala, Honduras, Salvador, Colombie, Équateur, Brésil, Argentine et Chili. Nous sommes particulièrement interpellées par la situation de défenseur-e-s des droits humains. Nous avons récemment contribué à des actions urgentes en solidarité avec les communautés mapuches huilliche du Fundo Alto Gaboa, Chiloé, Chili; avec les communautés affectées par le barrage Hidroituango en Colombie, avec le collectif Brésil-Montréal pour dénoncer le contexte des élections brésiliennes, avec les prisonniers politiques au Honduras, entre autres.</p>

UP TO $2,500 WILL BE MATCHED BY EBAY!!!WHAT ARE THE H.O.P.E. LOCKERS?
The H.O.P.E. Lockers are a day-use facility of safe and secure lockers for Salt Lake's homeless community to store their cherished belongings. They will include ADA access.
H.O.P.E. stands for “Helping Other
People Evolve,” and the Lockers will do just this by providing not only a safe space for storage, but also the peace of mind that comes with that while they look for employment, attend appointments and clinics, and generally
live their lives.

This project came from the homeless community itself. When you ask someone what they truly need to improve their lives, the answer is often surprising.


MUCH, MUCH MORE THAN ""JUST LOCKERS"" 
These Lockers provide not only a place to store things throughout the day, but the peace of mind that comes with knowing your worldly belongings, your resources, and your identity are protected.
Furthermore, these lockers will provide the homeless community the dignity to empower themselves and evolve their lives by obtaining and retaining employment, and other opportunities that come with the freedom of mobility.



ABOUT THE TEAM

This project is a product of the collective effort of two local 501(c)3 non-profit organizations: Revolution United and The Legacy Initiative. 
The H.O.P.E. Lockers are the first phase of a sustainable, self-governing village of tiny homes for the homeless of Salt Lake City, that will be called The Legacy Village SLC. 







REVOLUTION UNITED


Revolution United is a human centered nonprofit organization inciting a fundamental change in the way humans engage their communities in all sectors of life! Our mission is to develop open source projects utilizing inclusion, innovation, collective impact, and the desire for holistic well-being. We unify the  individuals, non-profits, and businesses to make it happen. THE LEGACY INITIATIVE
The Legacy Initiative's mission is to fight hunger, provide humanitarian aid, and educate people through community partnerships not just for today, but for our future.The
 idea for the Lockers came from within the homeless community itself, 
out of a collective brainstorming session called an ""Idea Silo.""


HOW WILL FUNDS BE USED?

We aim to be  completely transparent in this project, every step of the way. Regular updates of expenses and income will be provided to the community via our webpages. 

Because we are verified non-profit organizations, Indiegogo will only take 4% of the funds we raise if we meet our goal, or 6.75% if we don't!


The design and engineering work is being done complimentary by a member of our team, so we are keeping (wo)manpower costs at nearly zero.





STRETCH GOALS!
+ If we raise $13,000 total we will add solar panels that power security cameras.

+ If we raise $14,000 total, we will incorporate Legacy Village as it's own 501(c)3 non-profit organization. 
+ If we raise $20,000 total, we will build our first Tiny House for the Legacy Village SLC project.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This is where my journey to bring national attention to the shameful plight of homeless veterans began: in a homeless encampment ironically named “Camp Hopeville”, along the banks of the Mississippi, just north of St. Louis’ downtown. Hopeville was where I first encountered Leroy and Lumberjack, two of the more than 200,000 veterans—male and female—who are homeless in this country.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>My Cause: Igniting a National Conversation on the Plight of Homeless Veterans through Photography</strong></p>
<p>My name is Jerry Tovo. I am a St. Louis photographer and artist. But once I was a soldier, a drill sergeant in the Army. I have never been able to reconcile the void between the adulation our nation displays for our warrior-heroes and the virtual neglect our society shows once they return home with problems. A couple of years ago, I began to research homelessness among veterans. I was staggered to learn the huge number of vets who wander our streets homeless: approximately 200,000 on any given night, with an additional 1.5 million at risk for homelessness.</p>

<p><strong>WE'RE NOT GOING BACK PROJECT</strong></p>
<p>January 22 marks the 45th anniversary of Roe v Wade. Almost 50 years later, we are still fighting for those same rights. There are now SEVEN states which have just ONE remaining abortion clinic. Without these clinics we put millions of women’s health and their futures at risk. We refuse to stand by and do nothing.</p>
<p>Help us ensure access to abortion is a right for EVERY woman (not just those with money or those living in certain states). </p>
<p><strong>Why are we doing this?</strong></p>
<p>Because <strong>WE’RE NOT GOING BACK.</strong> We refuse to stand by and watch as MILLIONS of women lose access to abortion services. 1 in 4 women in US will have an abortion in her life and without these clinics we put women's lives at risk. So, let's not post angry quotes on Instagram or Facebook. Let's take action. Let's put our money to work and create meaningful change for women in the states who need it most.</p>
<p><strong>We are the leaders we have been waiting for.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Our Goal</strong></p>
<p>The ‘<strong>WE’RE NOT GOING BACK</strong>’ Project funds will go directly to the Sioux Falls Planned Parenthood Clinic in South Dakota. If this project is funded, we can ensure hundreds of thousands of women have access to the health care they need in a state where that healthcare is most at risk.</p>
<ul>
<li>$650 helps one women who needs financial aid meet the cost of their abortion care.</li>
<li>$5,000 allows doctors to travel to and from Sioux Falls for 1 month.</li>
<li>$50,000 covers the cost of a security guard for the clinic for 1 year.</li>
<li>$250,000 pays for medical staff to serve the clinic for 1 year.</li>
<li>$750,000 funds the clinic to stay open for a 1 year.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Why South Dakota?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sioux Falls Planned Parenthood runs the ONLY REMAINING healthcare clinic offering abortion in the state of South Dakota.</li>
<li>Every branch of government in South Dakota is solidly opposed to abortion – the legislature, the Governor’s office, and the Attorney General.</li>
<li>Women who get an abortion in South Dakota must make two trips to the clinic – 72 hours apart – because state legislators think women need three days to “really think” about their decision. </li>
<li>35% of women who use this clinic travel more than 300 miles round trip.</li>
<li>Planned Parenthood doctors are forced to tell patients that they are at increased risk for suicide and that's a LIE.</li>
</ul>
<p>​<strong>More crazy sh*t that happened in South Dakota:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Isaac Latterell, a state representative and majority whip for the South Dakota House, once penned a blog titled, “Planned Parenthood worse than ISIS and lying about it.”</li>
<li>In 2011, a bill was introduced in the South Dakota legislature that would have <strong>legalized the killing of any doctor who performs an abortion.</strong>
</li>
<li>In 2015, The Institute for Women’s Policy Research named South Dakota <strong>the worst state in the nation for reproductive rights.</strong>

Without these clinics we put millions of women’s health and their futures at risk. We refuse to stand by and do nothing.
Help us ensure access to abortion is a right for EVERY woman (not just those with money or those living in certain states). 
Why are we doing this?
Because WE’RE NOT GOING BACK. We refuse to stand by and watch as MILLIONS of women lose access to abortion services. 1 in 4 women in US will have an abortion in her life and without these clinics we put women's lives at risk. So, let's not post angry quotes on Instagram or Facebook. Let's take action. Let's put our money to work and create meaningful change for women in the states who need it most.

The ‘WE’RE NOT GOING BACK’ Project funds will go directly to the Sioux Falls Planned Parenthood Clinic in South Dakota. If this project is funded, we can ensure hundreds of thousands of women have access to the health care they need in a state where that healthcare is most at risk.

$650 helps one women who needs financial aid meet the cost of their abortion care.

Sioux Falls Planned Parenthood runs the ONLY REMAINING healthcare clinic offering abortion in the state of South Dakota.

Women who get an abortion in South Dakota must make two trips to the clinic – 72 hours apart – because state legislators think women need three days to “really think” about their decision. 
35% of women who use this clinic travel more than 300 miles round trip.
Planned Parenthood doctors are forced to tell patients that they are at increased risk for suicide and that's a LIE.

​More crazy sh*t that happened in South Dakota:

Isaac Latterell, a state representative and majority whip for the South Dakota House, once penned a blog titled, “Planned Parenthood worse than ISIS and lying about it.”

In 2015, The Institute for Women’s Policy Research named South Dakota the worst state in the nation for reproductive rights.



What your funding means?

Sioux Falls Planned Parenthood can serve every woman who seeks an abortion in South Dakota.
Sioux Falls Planned Parenthood will fight unconstitutional laws at the legislature and on the ballot.
Sioux Falls Planned Parenthood will continue to organize the resistance and train new leaders in South Dakota.


When we receive your funds, we will remove the fees for Indiegogo, the credit card processing fees, and the cost of the product -- EVERYTHING ELSE will go directly to Sioux Falls Planned Parenthood clinic. We expect those total fees to be about 20% of the funds, and the remaining 80% of funds will go directly to the clinic.

How else can you help?
If you can fund this project, please do.
If you can’t, please share it all over the internet.
Either way you’ll be helping women across the country access the healthcare they really need.
