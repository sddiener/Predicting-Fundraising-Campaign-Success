<p>Réaliser et produire le <strong>9e album de LA VIE QU'ON MÈNE, 64 pages, en couleurs</strong>. Je fais les<strong> textes, les dessins et la couleur</strong>. J'ai besoin d'y travailler au moins 7 mois en dessinant<strong> 8 à 10 pages par mois</strong> au minimum.

<p>J'ai besoin de<strong> 9,000$</strong> pour ce faire et imprimer au minimum 500 albums. Mon projet sera en ligne 40 jours. Vous verrez dans ma page <strong>comment</strong> vous pouvez <strong>contribuer</strong> à la réalisation de mon projet. Il existe <strong>plusieurs options</strong>, et même celle de partager ma page à vos amis. Vous pouvez donc faire partie du <b>succès </b>de ce projet, de différentes façons.. Voir les contreparties auxquelles vous pouvez <b>participer</b> dans l'onglet CONTREPARTIES.</p>
<p>L'album 9 de<strong> La vie qu'on mène </strong>sera plus personnel. Une sorte de journal de ces dernières années, oû, tout le monde autour de moi, vivait  de voyages et de satisfaisantes réalisations (!), alors que je ne cessais de chercher comment je pourrais faire mon prochain album, <strong>tout en écrivant la trame</strong>...de ce qui se passait... </p>
<p>La création bandes dessinées a toujours été  l'autre moitié de ma vie de travail (J'ai animé des séances de conditionnement physique sur musique pendant 26 années) .Mes albums sont<b> pour un public adulte, mais peuvent plaire aussi aux enfants.  J'ai des lecteurs de 10 à 90 ans!</b></p>

<p><strong>POURQUOI UNE PLATE FORME DE SOCIO FINANCEMENT?</strong></p>
<p><strong>POUR LES AUTRES ALBUMS</strong><strong> J'AVAIS FAIT DES PRÉPUBLICATIONS, ou J'AVAIS EU DES BOURSES DE TRAVAIL DU  CONSEIL DES ARTS DU CANADA, CETTE FOIS JE RECOMMENCE À NEUF.</strong></p>

L'album est pratiquement tout scénarisé et j'utiliserai 7 à 8 mois pour le dessiner. Pour ensuite le faire imprimer (avec le nom des supporteurs inclus dans l'album.)Voyez à droite de l'écran les possibilités de supporter ce projet: QUI JE SUIS:Mon nom est Line Arsenault, je vis à Québec. Je suis auteure de bandes dessinées (comic strips ) depuis bientôt 30 ans!.Mes courtes histoires sont réflectives, mais il semble, un écho et un miroir de notre société..J'observe,je note, je cherche l'angle... et réorganise en cases et en mots..C'est un peu l'art que j'ai développé au long des années et il paraît que je le fais très efficacement. :)J'ai fait mes débuts à l`âge de 15 ans dans le journal de ma région natale : LA VOIX GASPÉSIENNE , avec des chroniques hebdomadaires d'humour, qui finalement auront duré 9 ans...!!!! ( 468 textes et le début de mes bandes dessinées). Merci M. Gilles Gagné!! Jusqu'ici j'ai publié 8 albums, dont 5 en couleur chez 400 coups/Mille Iles, et 3 à mon compte. Ma série s'appelle LA VIE QU'ON MÈNE.Entre 1985 et 2004, j'ai publié dans plusieurs journaux et magazines dont: LE SOLEIL de Québec, 1985-86, et à nouveau de 2002 à 2004, À TOUS LES JOURS! J'ai publié aussi dans le magazine L'ACTUALITÉ, de 1992 à 1994, dans LE DEVOIR en 1996, SAFARIR en 1995, le journal interne de la Société d'Assurance auto du Québec (6 ans), le journal interne de l'AQRP (6 ans).ÉCRITURE TÉLÉ: De 1996 à 2002, j'ai collaboré aux scénarios de UN GARS UNE FILLE, en travaillant pour Guy A. LEPAGE.Mes albums se sont vendus  au Québec et Canada français entre 1995 et 2004, à chaque fois à près de 3,000 copies par tome. Ce  qui ( à ce qu'on dit dans le milieu) représente des chiffres de Best Seller. Ce dessin de la couverture du tome 1, a été également un succès inégalé sur t-shirts (Les Mecs) au Québec, entre 1989 et 1991. Près de 30,000 t-shirts de ce dessin ont trouvé porteur…! ""Dernièrement encore, après une conférence, quand on m'a posé la question:Ce métier, c'est un choix que tu as fait? j'ai été incapable de dire oui! J'ai simplement travaillé vers ça, contrat par contrat, semaine par semaine, une étape à la fois, sans trop regarder en avant.""  Moi, vers 2009



"" C'est dans ses observations du monde qui l'entoure et dans le découpage qu'elle fait de ses petites histoires que réside sa force.  On aime ou  on n'aime pas son graphisme, mais force nous est de constater qu'elle a réussi ce que très peu réussissent: se créer une signature graphique originale et personnelle.""

LE PROJET:
Réaliser et produire le 9e album de LA VIE QU'ON MÈNE, 64 pages, en couleurs. Je fais les textes, les dessins et la couleur. J'ai besoin d'y travailler au moins 7 mois en dessinant 8 à 10 pages par mois au minimum. Ensuite, organiser les étapes vers l'impression  et la reliure. Le tout pour livrer fin septembre  2015 pour mes supporteurs.
noir et blanc du début d'album 9
J'ai besoin de 9,000$ pour ce faire et imprimer au minimum 500 albums. Mon projet sera en ligne 40 jours. Vous verrez dans ma page comment vous pouvez contribuer à la réalisation de mon projet. Il existe plusieurs options, et même celle de partager ma page à vos amis. Vous pouvez donc faire partie du succès de ce projet, de différentes façons.. Voir les contreparties auxquelles vous pouvez participer dans l'onglet CONTREPARTIES.
L'album 9 de La vie qu'on mène sera plus personnel. Une sorte de journal de ces dernières années, oû, tout le monde autour de moi, vivait  de voyages et de satisfaisantes réalisations (!), alors que je ne cessais de chercher comment je pourrais faire mon prochain album, tout en écrivant la trame...de ce qui se passait... 
La création bandes dessinées a toujours été  l'autre moitié de ma vie de travail (J'ai animé des séances de conditionnement physique sur musique pendant 26 années) .Mes albums sont pour un public adulte, mais peuvent plaire aussi aux enfants.  J'ai des lecteurs de 10 à 90 ans!

POURQUOI UNE PLATE FORME DE SOCIO FINANCEMENT?
POUR LES AUTRES ALBUMS J'AVAIS FAIT DES PRÉPUBLICATIONS, ou J'AVAIS EU DES BOURSES DE TRAVAIL DU  CONSEIL DES ARTS DU CANADA, CETTE FOIS JE RECOMMENCE À NEUF.

<p>Sarà possibile ritirare in fiera solamente il perk '<strong>The Tome - Lucca</strong>', che contiene il solo libro Grimorio II, presso il Lucca Comics&amp;Games 2018.

<p>Per il ritiro in fiera sarà necessario mostrare<strong> la stampa o la screenshot </strong>dell'ordine effettuato, comprensivo di numero ordine.</p>

Grimorio II sarà un'Antologia con 25 autori, di 200+ pagine completamente a colori, in rilegatura brossurata, formato 16,8x24 cm. 
Come il suo predecessore che ha sancito la nascita di Attaccapanni Press, Grimorio, Grimorio II conterrà un insieme di fumetti e illustrazioni che vi trascineranno in mondi e storie diverse, stavolta non nello stregato ma al di là del Velo: nel mondo degli Spettri.
Dal 2016 l'etichetta Attaccapanni autoproduce Antologie come questa su temi intriganti, coinvolgendo grandi professionisti e talenti emergenti in libri confezionati con la massima cura... Grazie ai crowdfunding!
Vogliamo portare questo libro tra le vostre mani a partire da Lucca Comics&Games 2018, dove ci troverete in Self Area, ma questo sarà possibile solo se oggi, come in passato, ci sosterrete! 

All'Editing Laura Guglielmo, Ariel Vittori e Laura Vivacqua, con graphic design di Laura Guglielmo e Cover di Isabella Mazzanti. Tra le pagine del nuovo Grimorio troverete i seguenti autori:
Con storie a fumetti: Agnese Innocente (Dieter è Morto), Ariel Vittori (Little Waiting), Carlotta Di Cataldo, Giopota (Un Anno Senza Te), Ilaria Catalani (Hadez), Monica Sangermano, Laura Guglielmo (Dharma), Laura Vivacqua, Lonnie Bao, Martina Naldi, Ryan Lovelock, Silvia Vanni (Salomè), Valentina Brancati (Les Ravencroft), Zeno Colangelo, Fabio Mancini & Marco Bucci (Nomen Omen), Stefano Martinuz.
Con illustrazioni: Clarissa Corradin, Flavia Sorrentino, Giorgia Casetti, Jacopo Camagni, Leandra La Rosa, Mirko Failoni (Historia), Niccolò Pellizzòn (Haxa), Simone D'Armini (Spider King).


Ecco un'occhiatina più attenta ai gadget e alle occasioni che potrete avere solo supportandoci in questa campagna!
Se non solo i fantasmi vi ammaliano, ma vi aggrada anche la visione del fumetto indie di Attaccapanni Press in generale, troverete un pacchetto particolare con tutti i nostri progetti 2018, con inclusi, oltre Grimorio II:

Minimenù, ricettario illustrato di 86 pagine a colori con rilegatura a spirale. La Nuke, Laura Guglielmo e Ariel Vittori presentano 3 menù completi per rifocillare colleghi e non, perché non si vive di solo ramen.
Clessidra, numero 1° del nuovo periodico annuale di Attaccapanni Press, spillato, 62 pagine. La rivista di storie sul Tempo che inizia il suo viaggio esplorando le 4 stagioni con 4 autori, in storie da 12 pagine ciascuna: Laura Vivacqua, Francesco Guarnaccia, Tamara D'Amato e Flavia Biondi.
Non avendo noi uno store online questa sarà l'unica occasione, se non potrete frequentare le fiere a cui saremo presenti, per recuperare tutte insieme le nostre pubblicazioni dell'anno.
In un altro pacchetto avrete invece la possibilità di recuperare Grimorio: il sortilegio da cui è nato tutto questo. Per saperne di più, nella pagina della sua vecchia campagna Indiegogo trovate tutti i magici dettagli.

L'altra occasione unica del nostro crowdfunding è di ottenere dei gadget bellissimi! Dal pacchetto Spectre in su, che trovate anche in numero limitato nell'opzione scontata EARLY BIRD, trovate un segnalibro 5x21 con il dettaglio di una tavola di Stefano Martinuz e un foglio formato A6 di sticker eleganti e divertenti disegnato da Laura Guglielmo.

Nel pacchetto Ouija (e in quelli che lo contengono, Crystal e Ghostly Commission) troverete anche l'ipnotica Enamel Pin argentata con l'occhio simbolo di Grimorio II. Sognavamo una spilla simile da molto tempo, non siete anche voi impazienti di sfoggiarla?
 

Abbiamo avuto il grande onore per questa campagna di collaborare con adepti di altre arti, ed ecco che nel pacchetto Skull trovate oltre al prezioso bottino del pacchetto Spectre anche un magico incenso in legno da bruciare per evocare qualunque spirito e uno splendido pendaglio in resina con una replica di teschio di corvo dal laboratorio di FiveForges. 
 

Nei pacchetti Crystal trovate l'intero pacchetto Ouija e in più un gioiello dall'officina di Clean&Decay, realizzato appositamente per noi in cemento, resina e pirite: spettrale, brilla nel buio! Potete scegliere il vostro, unico, tra quelli qui raffigurati scegliendo il pacchetto del numero corrispondente.

 
Sarà possibile ritirare in fiera solamente il perk 'The Tome - Lucca', che contiene il solo libro Grimorio II, presso il Lucca Comics&Games 2018. Tutti gli altri perk richiederanno il pagamento per il servizio di spedizione a domicilio: tutto questo per questioni di logistica che ci impediscono di portare fisicamente con noi troppi volumi!

Se non siete sicuri di poter passare in fiera, vi consigliamo di scegliere il perk 'The Tome': effettueremo le spedizioni prima del Lucca Comics, quindi non sarete lasciati indietro!

Per Grimorio II abbiamo previsto una tiratura di 1000 copie, che stamperemo su carta patinata opaca grazie a PressUp. Avendo inoltre finito le copie di Grimorio, una parte del goal servirà alla terza ristampa del primo volume. 
La maggior parte dei fondi servirà dunque a coprire le spese di stampa (50%) e la produzione dei gadget dei vari perk (15%). Circa il 10% del goal servirà a pagare le tasse di Indiegogo e Paypal. Dalla nostra esperienza, il 12% corrisponderà a spese di spedizione, inclusive di packaging.

Abbiamo già sostenuto con successo tre campagne crowdfunding proprio qui su Indiegogo, per un totale di 3000 copie stampate, 50+ artisti coinvolti, 400+ spedizioni. Forgiate dal fuoco di mille pacchetti e prove di stampa, siamo pronte a rispettare tutte le nostre promesse e far sì che la vostra fiducia sia ben riposta. 
Potete aiutare Grimorio II a materializzarsi tra voi anche e soprattutto spargendo la voce: condividete la pagina della campagna sui vostri social media, parlatene con i vostri amici, familiari, colleghi! Ve ne saremo infinitamente grati.

Let's take a closer look at the rewards that you'll only be able to get by supporting us in this campaign!
If, along with ghosts, you are also interested in the way Attaccapanni Press makes comics, among the perks you will find one in particular which will get you all of the three new books we will be making in 2018:

Minimenù, an illustrated cookbook by La Nuke, Laura Guglielmo and Ariel Vittori, with 3 complete menus perfect to satisfy the palates of both fellow artists and sophisticated gourmet friends.
The first issue of Clessidra, our label's first magazine of short comics about the concept of Time. This first issue will be about The Four Seasons, and it will feature four 12-page stories by Laura Vivacqua, Francesco Guarnaccia, Tamara D'Amato and Flavia Biondi.
In a separate package you can instead pick up the first volume of Grimorio: the spell that started it all. You can read more about it in the Book's old Indiegogo campaign page, here.
Since we don't have an online store, this crowdfunding will be the only chance to get these books if you already know you won't be able to attend any of the future conventions we'll participate in.

The only perk that can be picked up at Lucca Comics and Games 2018 after purchasing it is 'The Tome – Lucca', featuring the book only, in Italian. All of the other perks will have to be shipped for logistic reasons.
To collect the volume at the convention, you must present the printed receipt or a screenshot of your purchase, including the order number.

<p>Hey there, Matt Warwick's the name.

As such, I am pouring this expertise into an ongoing comic series called '<i>FERAL</i>', which features a lot of head kicking, coupled with a narrative of personal development, sportsmanship, and the dangers of ego and pride.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/772626/files/20140807111344-Hayley_headshot.jpg?1407435224"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i>FERAL</i> follows an unknown hustler named Hayley Rosa as she endeavours to settle a score with a man named Dr.Brandt, the only fighter to beat her. To do that, she enlists in the city-wide circuit of fighters known as 'Feral', and starts to climb the ranks. As she does so, the journey begins to change everything she believes she is capable of, unleashing dangerous parts of her she never knew she had...</p>
<p>This is the second book in the <i>FERAL</i> series, which will see the circuit drag out more of Hayley's darker sides as she struggles to find her footing whilst pushing against the strength of the city's top tier. </p>
<p></p>

<ul></ul>
<div>
<p>To tackle the next book and continue this saga through to completion, I'll need funding. I'm under no pretense that <i>FERAL</i> exists because of its fans, so I strive to give them something fantastic and fresh in the world of furry comics.<br/></p>
<p>What I am asking for in this campaign is the basic funding for the majority of the costs involved with self publishing. This includes printing costs, advertising and programs/ equipment. I've enlisted <a href=""http://taalaruhun.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Taala</a> to help speed up the shading process (as she helped on the first book), but she also needs to live, thus I am paying for her time. On top of that, some of the higher tier perks are being coloured externally by <a href=""http://www.kyyro.com/neko/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Neko-Maya</a>, the same one who coloured both the <a href=""http://www.furaffinity.net/view/14186692/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">current</a> and <a href=""http://www.furaffinity.net/full/11795034/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">previous</a> front covers of <i>FERAL</i>.</p>
</div>
<div>Since the last comic was a decent success (sold around 30 of the 50 I took to Confuzzled, and orders still coming in), the funding goal has been reduced drastically, compared the last two campaigns. However, because most of my current money is going on moving out fairly soon, I have decided to get the essentials using public funding. Also I am sticking with a fixed funding option so Paypal doesn't rinse it horribly (meaning less of your money is wasted because of Paypal taxing each payment that comes in individually).</div>
<div>Estimated costs of each item are as follows - </div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Manga Studio EX5</b> (needed for its specific comic creation tools to speed up the creation process) - <b>$110</b>
</li>
<li>
<b>A new external Hard Drive</b> (my current one is slow, nearing capacity and very old. This is to ensure that things don't go horribly wrong, incase my computer explodes) - <b>$100+</b>
</li>
<li>
<b>Printing costs</b> (self explanatory really. Will be going with the same printers as before, since their service was awesome) - <b>$450-500</b>
</li>
<li>
<b>Merchandise creation</b> (all the awesome little collectables like postcards, posters and whatnot, as well as advertising space and stuff) - <b>$250 - 350</b>
</li>
<li>
<b>Paid help</b> (my shader, Taala, is still in essence my employee, so I will need to allocate suitable wages for her work. I am also collaborating with other artists to make the top tier perks even better, so think of it as you're also paying THEM for incredible results!) - <b>$400-500</b>
</li>
<li>
<b>General costs</b> (postage, travel etc etc) - <b>$100</b>
</li>
</ul>
<div>The perks for contributing to the campaign include lots and LOTS of awesome art, including an entire comic with your character (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.213615308843667.1073741832.188447751360423&amp;type=3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">click here to check out the last contributor's comic</a>) and of course, a copy of Part 2 when it is complete! </div>
<div>As I mentioned before, the <i>FERAL</i> comic is built upon fans and as such, community inclusion is something I very much enjoy doing. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">For example, check out the people who contributed in the last campaign and got an extras role in the comic itself:-</span>

</div>
<div>This time around, I'm going to be creating something more personal that you can touch. <b>All $100 perks will be turned into physical badges</b>, so you can literally wear your badassery. They will still be featured in the book, placed in the crowds and such, making your character a living, breathing part of the <i>FERAL</i> world.</div>
<div>It has to be known that you don't NEED to be a furry to enjoy this. <b>Humans, though rare, are welcome in this world and are seen as no different (since my roots are in manga, I have the skills to draw human characters).</b>

<ul></ul>
<div>When I completed the first book, I felt myself become stronger and smarter. However, this knowledge and experience brought many unseen hurdles into view, thus even with my sudden boost of passion, I tread more warily this time.</div>
<div>Of the many problems that a self employed freelance comic artist encounters, here are the ones that are most dangerous...</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Funding not reaching its goal </b>- The worst case scenario with this is that the comic is severely delayed. Since I opted for fixed funding this time around to maximise backing funds, it also means I could get literally nothing at all. This in turn means that I will need to look for other ways to get the money to do everything, mostly by doing other art, meaning the comic is put on the backburner for a few months (or maybe more...).</li>
<li>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">Not finishing by the deadline</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> - Well, I've made a grand promise to complete this by the end of May. I am fully capable of doing this, now I have real help to take load off my shoulders. To help speed things up, I am streamlining the creation process using Manga Studio, which allows me to see a constant PDF view of my comic, meaning I can plan ahead with double page spreads and the such, eliminating guess work and also discarding the need for outsourcing the print PDF creation.</span>
</li>
<li>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">Unforeseen computer and hardware problems</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> - My computer is pretty old, my Wacom tablet even older. Both have run at a consistently good click since I got them early 2008 - 2009, what with near constant use and abuse. However just because nothing <b>IS</b> wrong doesn't mean something </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">CAN'T</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> go wrong. All of <i>FERAL</i> is created digitally, and as such if one piece of hardware dies, the project is brought to a grinding halt. With the new hard drive, I can ensure that the project itself is spared in the unlikely event of the death of my computer, and my current model of tablet is cheap to replace. I have prepared for the worst, and like above, the worst thing that will happen are severe delays.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<div>--------------------------------<br/>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>In the unlikely event that one of the above happens, you will all be noted as soon as possible. That said, nothing will stop this project from happening. It will only be slowed, never halted, so regardless of what the world decides to throw at me, <i>FERAL</i> <u>will</u> be made!</div>

They will still be featured in the book, placed in the crowds and such, making your character a living, breathing part of the FERAL world.
It has to be known that you don't NEED to be a furry to enjoy this. Humans, though rare, are welcome in this world and are seen as no different (since my roots are in manga, I have the skills to draw human characters).

Check the Gallery to see other examples of perk commissions from the last campaign!



What happens to all the excess money? Well, your devotion and constant volleys of Dollar bill Hadokens will not go unrewarded. I've set up some stretch goals to ensure that I don't just pile up money in a bathtub and bathe in it.Beforehand though, I'll make this clear - none of the initial $2000 will be used for living expenses. However, more money means more stuff, and indeed I will likely be able to allocate the excess money to ease the commissions load, thus leaving more time to work solely on the comic and nothing else!
Also, for every stretch goal I hit, I will add another 10 books to the final print amount, meaning more FERAL for everyone!

$3000 - FERAL part 1 second wind! I'll print off a second run of 100 FERAL part 1 books, so if you missed the initial hype, you can jump right back on it! $3000 GOAL IS HIT!!! AN EXTRA 100 FERAL VOLUME 1 WILL BE PRINTED OFF, AS WELL AS 10 ADDITIONAL VOLUME 2 BOOKS!


$4000 - FERAL: Bigger and Better! I'll print off a run of A4 versions of both the first and second books, both with more pages featuring additional artwork throughout! $4000 GOAL IS HIT!!! 25 LIMITED EDITION A4 BOOKS OF BOTH VOLUME 1 AND 2 WILL BE PRINTED, AS WELL AS ANOTHER 10 OF THE ORIGINAL VOLUME 2, MAKING THE SECOND VOLUME 120 BOOKS STRONG!



$5000 - FERAL Short stories! Hayley isn't the only one that needs fleshing out! For reaching this goal, I'll make and print a limited run of a book featuring short stories of the current top tier, where they came from, their stories and a deeper look into their lives...

$6000 - FERAL physical miniatures! This amount will fund casting and creation of exclusive and awesome marble-look plastic 5'' miniatures of the protagonist Hayley, which will be added to the 'Sleeper Hold' ($250) perk and also available for general sale.



  



When I completed the first book, I felt myself become stronger and smarter. However, this knowledge and experience brought many unseen hurdles into view, thus even with my sudden boost of passion, I tread more warily this time.
Of the many problems that a self employed freelance comic artist encounters, here are the ones that are most dangerous...



Funding not reaching its goal - The worst case scenario with this is that the comic is severely delayed. Since I opted for fixed funding this time around to maximise backing funds, it also means I could get literally nothing at all. This in turn means that I will need to look for other ways to get the money to do everything, mostly by doing other art, meaning the comic is put on the backburner for a few months (or maybe more...).

Not finishing by the deadline - Well, I've made a grand promise to complete this by the end of May. I am fully capable of doing this, now I have real help to take load off my shoulders. To help speed things up, I am streamlining the creation process using Manga Studio, which allows me to see a constant PDF view of my comic, meaning I can plan ahead with double page spreads and the such, eliminating guess work and also discarding the need for outsourcing the print PDF creation.


Unforeseen computer and hardware problems - My computer is pretty old, my Wacom tablet even older. Both have run at a consistently good click since I got them early 2008 - 2009, what with near constant use and abuse. However just because nothing IS wrong doesn't mean something CAN'T go wrong. All of FERAL is created digitally, and as such if one piece of hardware dies, the project is brought to a grinding halt. With the new hard drive, I can ensure that the project itself is spared in the unlikely event of the death of my computer, and my current model of tablet is cheap to replace. I have prepared for the worst, and like above, the worst thing that will happen are severe delays.


--------------------------------



In the unlikely event that one of the above happens, you will all be noted as soon as possible. That said, nothing will stop this project from happening. It will only be slowed, never halted, so regardless of what the world decides to throw at me, FERAL will be made!


Not all of you are capable of putting cash into the campaign and there's nothing wrong with that at all! Sometimes, recognition and exposure trumps funding, so why not give us a like on Facebook, follow on Twitter, bookmark the Main Website and tell all your friends and family!
Also, there is also an option to save on the digital copy of the first book by sharing on social networking. Simply go to the payhip site and click on the sharing button (below the buy button) to get a cool discount!
Also, totally check out the other artists who contribute their time to my project, like Neko-Maya and Taala, since they deserve special mention for being awesome and mega talented in their own right!
--------------------------------

So that's it. Thankyou for taking the time to look over, consider and contribute to one of the most passionate projects I've ever created, one that will continue on to an awesome final conclusion.
As always guys, take care and see you at the next fight!",10.0,0,"5 Campaigns

The pages have a lot of movement and detail. The characters look great against wonderful backgrounds. The pencils are up there with the best that I’ve seen from any company, large or indie. This book is definitely worth checking out."" ABOUT ME: Hi, my name is Zain and I’m the writer for The Elemental Balance. I’ve always had a passion for writing stories. In fact, my first story “Game Plan” was written to impress my wife. Spoiler alert, it paid off! I find it rewarding to bring entertainment to people, that’s my niche! My style of storytelling is grounded in reality but, nonetheless, is fiction. Characters are set in unrealistic situations but have very relatable emotions. Imagine if someone could achieve greatness with a determined will, how would they react if they had powers? This is what my stories are rooted in….emotions!  ABOUT THE ARTIST:Luke Horsman is an extremely talented artist from the UK. He is well versed in many forms of art mediums. In fact, Luke did the pencils, ink, and coloring for the first three chapters. His artwork has truly brought the characters from the script to life. It's been a blast working with him. We mesh really well. I'm particular with scenes and visual symbolism and he's keen on creating eye-catching, bold illustrations. Together we made an excellent team!  Check out Luke's website for awesome artwork by clicking here.Other Ways You Can HelpSometimes budgets are tight, and we understand if you can't contribute.  But you still can help us out tremendously if you get the word out.The easiest way to do that is by using the Indiegogo share tools. Contact UsNeed some help?

<h2><strong>HISTORY OF THE PROJECT</strong></h2>
<p>""Return of the French Guy"" started out as a feature-length sequel to ""The Unwritten Rule Trilogy"", which was a series of Star Wars fan films we made back in 2003 and 2004. It started out as just a single film - ""Shotgun"" - but we enjoyed making it so much and it was so well received by our friends and the fan film community that we had to make more. By the time we completed ""Ex"", the third part in the trilogy, we already had ideas for a two-hour epic that would explore the questions we'd always avoided - who were these guys? How can they use the Force? Where did they get lightsabers? What the hell is going on?! ""Return of the French Guy"" was meant to answer those questions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we were in our final years of university and our coursework had to take priority. Once we graduated, life just sort of swept us away from one another, and despite a deep desire to tell this story, we missed our window. So for the past few years we've been trying to figure out an alternative way of telling this story that doesn’t require taking a few months off work to shoot a film. A couple of years ago we realised that it would make an amazing episodic story, and a graphic novel/comic was the perfect fit.</p>
<p>We began rewriting the script to fit a 4-6 panel format designed to be released in weekly instalments, but we still had one fundamental problem: we can’t draw! So we started searching for artists who would design the characters and create a library of assets that we could use to piece each page together ourselves. Some very kind and talented artists donated their time and efforts to this endeavour, but it was impossible to get them as invested in the project as we wanted them to be. So despite the best of intentions, that idea ultimately failed.</p>
<p>And then crowd funding happened.</p>
<p>BOOM! It was <em>everywhere!</em> And suddenly this story that we'd been trying to tell for years and had all but given up on, suddenly and unexpectedly had one last hope. YOU are our one last hope. <strong>Our<em> only </em>hope.</strong></p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>
<h3>What happens if you don't hit your target? Will you be able to provide all the rewards?</h3>
<p>Yes, absolutely! As long as we hit 50% of our target, we still get to make the full 28 page first issue, and provide all the promised rewards for backers, but we'll have to make a sacrifice in terms of quality - Abel will just produce each page in black and white, leaving it up to Jon and Ryan to decide if they want to colour each one in themselves or just release the comic as-is.</p>
<p>If we don't hit 50% then we will provide all rewards first (as much as is possible without the budget to complete the first issue) and then make as much of the comic as we can!</p>
<h3><strong>So what happens now if we get more than 50%?</strong></h3>
<p>We'll improve the quality of issue 1 and make as much of issue 2 as we possibly can before setting up another campaign to get the rest made!</p>
<h3>Why does the video talk about Kickstarter at the end?</h3>
<p>When we filmed it, we originally intended to post the video on Kickstarter, and we weren't able to get back together to re-shoot it for Indiegogo. Hopefully it doesn't really matter!</p></div>","UPDATE
We’ve done it! We’ve hit out 50% minimal target! ISSUE 1 IS GETTING MADE!

LEGAL DISCLAIMER
“Unlikely Jedi” does not take place in the Star Wars universe, nor does it contain any characters created by LucasFilm Ltd. Beyond the use of the word Jedi and similar references to Star Wars, “Return of the French Guy” is an original story, a homage to a cultural phenomenon. At worst, it could be considered fan fiction, which LucasFilm Ltd. has historically been supportive of.
Any and all funding we receive through Indiegogo will be used to produce the Unlikely Jedi comic/graphic novel and related promotional material.
Unlikely Jedi is not made, distributed, or supported by LucasFilm Ltd. and/or its licensors.

FAQ
What happens if you don't hit your target? Will you be able to provide all the rewards?
Yes, absolutely! As long as we hit 50% of our target, we still get to make the full 28 page first issue, and provide all the promised rewards for backers, but we'll have to make a sacrifice in terms of quality - Abel will just produce each page in black and white, leaving it up to Jon and Ryan to decide if they want to colour each one in themselves or just release the comic as-is.
If we don't hit 50% then we will provide all rewards first (as much as is possible without the budget to complete the first issue) and then make as much of the comic as we can!
So what happens now if we get more than 50%?
We'll improve the quality of issue 1 and make as much of issue 2 as we possibly can before setting up another campaign to get the rest made!
Why does the video talk about Kickstarter at the end?
When we filmed it, we originally intended to post the video on Kickstarter, and we weren't able to get back together to re-shoot it for Indiegogo. Hopefully it doesn't really matter!",9.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>First newspaper article about Ash is out! Click to see a mostly-finished frame! <a href=""http://www.northernlife.ca/news/lifestyle/2012/07/20-jesse-jordan-ash-sudbury.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.northernlife.ca/news/lifestyle/2012/...</a></p>
<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p>Johnathan Ash is a detective.</p>
<p>Well, used to be.</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago, while investigating a string of grisly murders, Detective Johnathan Ash was run down while following up on a lead. Fortunately, a passerby saw the incident and called an ambulance. He was rushed to the hospital, and after intensive surgery, was lucky to survive, and with only a few side-effects. <br/><br/>For one, a tiny shred of scrap metal had been imbedded in his brain, and could not be removed without risking further damage. For two, the damage to his brain had caused him to develop clairvoyance, mild telekinetic powers, and a limited psychic ability. <br/><br/>With his new-found senses, he came to the horrible realization that the killer was none other then his own brother, Quinton Ash. Leading the police to Quinton was no small task, having to convince them that his 'flash of insight' was valid, but eventually Ash won out. Unfortunately, rather then be caught, Quinton sat down, poured a nice glass of scotch, and set his house on fire around himself.</p>
<p>The case was closed, and with it, Ash's career. His 'sudden realization' looked more like an admission of guilt rather then a moment of brilliance. With no control over his ability to 'read minds', and no way to prove himself, the chief of police suspected Ash was an accomplice to his brother's crimes. Besides, who ever heard of a mind reader? An investigation was launched, and Ash's badge and gun were taken away permanently. His name tarnished and his reputation shot, his life fell apart around him. His wife left him, taking everything with her, leaving Ash to have to take a job as a cab driver while living out of a shady motel in the worst part of town.<br/><br/>Fifteen years later, another string of shockingly similar murders takes place, and the police force once again suspects Ash. Sending in a rookie detective, who happens to be a cold-hearted cop with past connection to Ash, a web of intrigue and conspiracy is suddenly revealed, and it's up to Ash and his unlikely ally to solve the case...<br/><br/>And maybe, just maybe, get Ash's badge back.</p>
<h3>
<br/><br/>I say, what's all this about, then?</h3>
<p>Why, I'll tell you what it's about!<br/><br/>'Ash' is a graphic novel that I've written, and want to show the world. Unfortunately, since my drawing skills are about on-par with that of the average two year old, the standard approach just isn't going to cut it. But, while spending some time at a photography store a while back, it hit me: Why not use pictures instead of drawings? I can still tell a fantastic story, and with the right people involved, 'Ash' will come out looking like a movie! Well, a movie that you read.</p>
<p>...Which is just called a 'book'. You know what? Not important.</p>
<p>What is important is how much work is going into this project, is going to be put into the project, and how great I think the end result will be!</p>
<h3>Who the devil are you?</h3>
<p>I'm Batman. <br/><br/>Well, no, sadly. But, who I am is Jesse Jordan, a freelance writer based out of Sudbury, Ontario. 'Freelance' is a polite way to say I work a ton, but make  little money. But, writing has been my lifelong dream, and I'm way okay with that. I can be found on IMDB as the writer for the upcomming feature film 'Luxeon', (<a href=""http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2400397/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2400397/</a>), and all across the interwebs for writing articles and bit pieces on various websites, podcasts and organisations. I'm currently working on two more screenplays, various short films, stories and videos that will be posted up all over the place!</p>
<h3>Alright then. Why are you here, and why should I give you my money?</h3>
<p>Well, to be honest, it's because I can't afford to do this project on my own! For starters, Printing the book will cost roughty four thousand dollars. Advertising will be close to five thousand, then there's the supplies, food and transportation for the cast and crew, locations, lighting, costumes, props, the website...</p>
<p>There's a LOT that needs to be paid for. I've managed to assemble a fantastic group of actors/models, and some lovely photographers who also think my idea is pretty fantastic, and we will do the project regardless, but without funding, it's not going to be able to get off the ground =/</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Wait, you want how much... For a book?</h3>
<p>15,000 is a lot, I know! But here's the thing; This project is being worked on and produced as if it were a movie; Sets, lighting, locations, actors, props... Everything! Because of that, it's a lot more expensive then just any graphic novel.<br/><br/>Thankfully, effects will be done digitally, but still. That's a lot of stuff to pay for!</p>
<p>Take a look at this list, and hopefully you'll understand why I'm trying to raise so much. In order of importance:</p>
<p>PRINTING AND PUBLISHING COSTS:</p>
<p>-Will cost, according to an exact quote, 3,971.00$ after tax. Why so much? Because we need very high-quality printing to get a really good rendition of these photos! <br/><br/>QUITE HONESTLY, if we can raise this 4K, I'll be more then happy. Why? Because with printing paid for, the project will still happen! Even if everything else has to begged, borrowed, or stolen (Not litteraly...), the project will still move forward as long as printing is paid for!<br/><br/>ADVERTISING:<br/><br/>-Between web advertising, social media marketing, ads on various webcomic sites, and some flyers and banners for the local bookstores, the amount needed for advertising is about 5,000.00$. The more money that goes into advertising, the better though, because advertising the book is what will make it sell!<br/><br/></p>
<p>CAST AND CREW:<br/><br/>-If I can, I'd love to reward the crew for their time and effort. Once the bases are covered as far as printing and perks goes, and the advertising is satisfactory, I'd like to be able to pay my actors, photographers, and digital artists if I can! They aren't expecting anything from this, and neither am I, but if we can raise the money, then so be it!</p>
<p>FINALLY... THE COST OF PERKS!<br/><br/>-A portion of the proceeds of this indiegogo will actually just go right back to thanking you for your donation! Once you figure in printing limited edition hardcovers, the posters, shipping and handling, etc., it should come out to around 1,500.00$, give or take.</p>
<h3>What's in it for you?</h3>
<p>The thrill of completing my dream of having written a comic book! I'm not doing this for money, as nice as it would be to become a writer as a living. This is a dream project, and I'm doing everything I can to make it happen!<br/><br/>To that end, If we happen to raise more money then what actually ends up being needed, there will be more perks given out as a thank you for making this happen!<br/><br/></p>
<h3>What's in it for us, eh?</h3>
<p>Every time you donate, you get a little piece of my heart to take home with you, you beautiful person, you &lt;3.</p>
<p>But seriously, there are some fantastic perks that range from a personalised 'thank you' card, to actually getting to appear in the graphic novel! Each and every donation will seriously make a big impact on how possible this project will become. Not to mention giving you spot in the credits as a contributor!</p>
<h3>And now, a word from our gentleman host</h3>
<p><br/>This project is a culmination of over a year's worth of work for me, and the shooting for the first few scenes started as of July 8th, and will continue on to well... As long as it takes! <br/><br/></p>
<p>Without your help, this project will finish, and go no where for a long, long time, until I can somehow amass all this money on my own. Will it happen? Eventually. I'm committed to this project 100%. Will it happen before, say, 2014? I have no idea. With full funding, if we get it, this project aims to be released February 2013, and will be...<br/><br/></p>
<h3>The world's first (photo)graphic novel released!</h3>
<p><br/>No, seriously. If I'm able to get full funding, Ash will be the first graphic novel to be made, published and released using still photographs with digital post edits rather then art for all of it's panels!</p>

Why, I'll tell you what it's about!'Ash' is a graphic novel that I've written, and want to show the world. Unfortunately, since my drawing skills are about on-par with that of the average two year old, the standard approach just isn't going to cut it. But, while spending some time at a photography store a while back, it hit me: Why not use pictures instead of drawings? I can still tell a fantastic story, and with the right people involved, 'Ash' will come out looking like a movie! Well, a movie that you read.
...Which is just called a 'book'. You know what? Not important.
What is important is how much work is going into this project, is going to be put into the project, and how great I think the end result will be!
Who the devil are you?
I'm Batman. Well, no, sadly. But, who I am is Jesse Jordan, a freelance writer based out of Sudbury, Ontario. 'Freelance' is a polite way to say I work a ton, but make  little money. But, writing has been my lifelong dream, and I'm way okay with that. I can be found on IMDB as the writer for the upcomming feature film 'Luxeon', (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2400397/), and all across the interwebs for writing articles and bit pieces on various websites, podcasts and organisations. I'm currently working on two more screenplays, various short films, stories and videos that will be posted up all over the place!
Alright then. Why are you here, and why should I give you my money?
Well, to be honest, it's because I can't afford to do this project on my own! For starters, Printing the book will cost roughty four thousand dollars. Advertising will be close to five thousand, then there's the supplies, food and transportation for the cast and crew, locations, lighting, costumes, props, the website...
There's a LOT that needs to be paid for. I've managed to assemble a fantastic group of actors/models, and some lovely photographers who also think my idea is pretty fantastic, and we will do the project regardless, but without funding, it's not going to be able to get off the ground =/


Wait, you want how much... For a book?
15,000 is a lot, I know! But here's the thing; This project is being worked on and produced as if it were a movie; Sets, lighting, locations, actors, props... Everything! Because of that, it's a lot more expensive then just any graphic novel.Thankfully, effects will be done digitally, but still. That's a lot of stuff to pay for!
Take a look at this list, and hopefully you'll understand why I'm trying to raise so much. In order of importance:
PRINTING AND PUBLISHING COSTS:
-Will cost, according to an exact quote, 3,971.00$ after tax. Why so much? Because we need very high-quality printing to get a really good rendition of these photos! QUITE HONESTLY, if we can raise this 4K, I'll be more then happy. Why? Because with printing paid for, the project will still happen! Even if everything else has to begged, borrowed, or stolen (Not litteraly...), the project will still move forward as long as printing is paid for!ADVERTISING:-Between web advertising, social media marketing, ads on various webcomic sites, and some flyers and banners for the local bookstores, the amount needed for advertising is about 5,000.00$. The more money that goes into advertising, the better though, because advertising the book is what will make it sell!
CAST AND CREW:-If I can, I'd love to reward the crew for their time and effort. Once the bases are covered as far as printing and perks goes, and the advertising is satisfactory, I'd like to be able to pay my actors, photographers, and digital artists if I can! They aren't expecting anything from this, and neither am I, but if we can raise the money, then so be it!
FINALLY... THE COST OF PERKS!-A portion of the proceeds of this indiegogo will actually just go right back to thanking you for your donation! Once you figure in printing limited edition hardcovers, the posters, shipping and handling, etc., it should come out to around 1,500.00$, give or take.
What's in it for you?
The thrill of completing my dream of having written a comic book! I'm not doing this for money, as nice as it would be to become a writer as a living. This is a dream project, and I'm doing everything I can to make it happen!To that end, If we happen to raise more money then what actually ends up being needed, there will be more perks given out as a thank you for making this happen!
What's in it for us, eh?
Every time you donate, you get a little piece of my heart to take home with you, you beautiful person, you <3.
But seriously, there are some fantastic perks that range from a personalised 'thank you' card, to actually getting to appear in the graphic novel! Each and every donation will seriously make a big impact on how possible this project will become. Not to mention giving you spot in the credits as a contributor!
And now, a word from our gentleman host
This project is a culmination of over a year's worth of work for me, and the shooting for the first few scenes started as of July 8th, and will continue on to well... As long as it takes! 
Without your help, this project will finish, and go no where for a long, long time, until I can somehow amass all this money on my own. Will it happen? Eventually. I'm committed to this project 100%. Will it happen before, say, 2014? I have no idea. With full funding, if we get it, this project aims to be released February 2013, and will be...
The world's first (photo)graphic novel released!
No, seriously. If I'm able to get full funding, Ash will be the first graphic novel to be made, published and released using still photographs with digital post edits rather then art for all of it's panels!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

 I’ve been doing illustrations for more than 10 years. As an avid fan of
 comic books/manga/graphic novels of all types, I don’t limit myself to a
 single genre, style or approach. I’m also a BIG fan of JRPGs, which 
give me a great deal of inspiration and ideas for my work. I like to 
push my limits with each new project I`m involved in to see how far can 
go. I sincerely believe that limiting one`s desire to progress would 
ultimately reduce one`s chances of learning new things; which in turn 
would cause their skills to rust. <br/><p>As a freelance graphic 
artist; I engage in commission based projects, concept art, portrait 
drawings, illustrations for children’s books, graphic designs for mobile
 games and applications, website artwork, logo designs, 3D modeling of 
buildings: exterior and interiors, etc.</p><p>For more info and samples of my work, please feel free to check out my portfolio at:</p><p><b><a href=""http://www.k-e-i-t-h.deviantart.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.k-e-i-t-h.deviantart.com</a></b></p>Undertaking
 this particular project has proven to be one of the most rewarding, 
challenging and fun learning experiences I`ve had in quite a while! The 
depth of the storyline and characters as well as the sheer scale of this
 overall project have given me a very rare opportunity to cut-loose and 
dive much deeper into exploring my artistic talents. We really do have a
 lot in store for you with this so I`m looking forward to completing 
this series and making it a <b>HUGE</b> success! But as mentioned in the
 video above; for that to happen we desperately need your help; 
therefore, I`d like to thank you all in advance for your contributions 
and support!<br/><br/><b>Chadvar Yordanov - Comic Artist / Illustrator / Animator</b><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/347710/files/20140203215034-chadVar_pic1.png?1391493034"" src="""" style=""""/></p>What you need to know about me probably can`t be found on a piece of paper; well at least not in words. I prefer to let my portfolio speak for itself. But to provide a little background; I finished a degree in traditional animation in 2012 and have been working as a freelance animator ever since. I specialize in concept art, storyboards and comic book illustrations and consistently complete works for various clients. I am an over-achiever with a tendency to put all my energy into my work. I`m always seeking new challenges, in order to improve my skills, while fueling my creativity with self-criticism, caffeine and nicotine. In the words of the famous Charles Bukowski: ""Find something you love and let it kill you"", that`s basically how I live.<br/><br/>To give you an idea of the quality of work your contributions will assist in adding to this project, feel free to stop by the links below and check out  samples of my work. This is the real McCoy; everything else is fugazy... fairy dust. Meaning that it doesn't really matter.<br/><br/><b><a href=""http://vimeo.com/chavdaryordanov"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://vimeo.com/chavdaryordanov</a><br/><br/><a href=""http://vimeo.com/chavdaryordanov"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://vimeo.com/chavdaryordanov</a></b><br/><br/>Like the other members of our team, I am also a big fan anime and manga, particularly the titles from the 80s and 90s that I grew up with. I love colorful characters, inventive and often crazy designs and the depth of stories with vast worlds to explore! Stories with a lot of fast-paced action will keep me glued to my seat for hours on end and “Project Wild FIRE” is no exception. After all, the main reasons I got involved in with The Ryukage project in the first place is because all these aspects are present in almost unhealthy doses!<br/>If you find yourself reminiscing about the golden age of comics and anime; the days of lively and believable characters with deep and exciting story lines, or if you constantly find yourself asking - ""Why don't they make them like that anymore?""; then this is the project that you should keep your eye on and support to your fullest capacity, because we really do have quite a lot of jaw-dropping excitement in store for you with this one.

Originally intended as a 13 episode drama for Japanese TV, ""The Ryukge"" is now being converted into a 26 Issue Comic Series (storyline completed) that will stand as a prequel to the events of the first book ""Wild FIRE: Legend of the Ryukage"". Genres : Martial Arts, Action, Fantasy Supernatural, Science FictionFeel : Serious / Gory / DarkFormats : Online Manga (black and white comic series for promotional usage), iOS Application (full color pages with animations, bonus content and  interactive elements for download on iPhone and iPad).SYNOPSIS : Hitoshi Morita is a traveling ronin samurai and trader.

Seeking to wipe out the remaining descendants of their old nemesis, Ayami Nishiyama, once and for all; the demons relentlessly attack Hitoshi and his family. But who are these mysterious warrior monks who

 enough to contain the sinister evil that is about to be unleashed once 
more upon the world? The battle for mankind`s future begins now! Those of you who are new to Wild FIRE, please feel free to view the FIRST 10 Pages of The Ryukage comic online for FREE! If you like what you see, come back and support our campaign.Follow us at: WILD FIRE SITE | TWITTER | FACEBOOKSample Page 1Sample Page 2The Ryukage (Main Cast) - PromoWe`ve already penciled and inked the First 10 Pages of ISSUE #1 and are currently working on the next 10 pages in addition to Programming the iOS Version of the Comic for the App Store. However; this project is 100% creator-owned, so until now the funding for this comic and all other projects in the Extended Projects Overview below has 
been completely out-of-pocket; which I must admit is a bit tough to 
manage. So in order for this to to be a success, we need to ask for your generosity! Without YOU the chances this becoming a reality are very low indeed.WHAT YOUR SUPPORT DOES : All money raised will go 
directly towards The Ryukage Comic & iOS App production & promotion costs and to give 
backers some cool rewards! Costs will include:
Paying the Comic Artist

Hiring our Assistant Comic Artist and Inker to work with us full-time (he only works with us part-time at the moment because we don`t have the funds to bring him fully on-board yet - but he`s good!)

Paying the Graphics Designer (logo/info)

Paying the iOS Development Costs (iPhone & iPad Versions)

Paying the printing & shipping costs of prints

Hiring an Editor (we really need one!)

Hiring an Admin Assistant to help keep track of and manage Contributor Perks (so that artists and I can just continue working on finishing the comics)

Paying the printing & shipping costs of t-shirts/mouse pads

Paying expenses for other promotional materials (multimedia, etc)
Our purpose is to complete the FIRST 10 ISSUES of this comic series in order to use them as marketing and
promotional tools (while creating a strong fan base) for the related projects noted in the Expanded Project Overview section below. IF THIS CAMPAIGN RAISES MORE THAN OUR TARGET for completion of the first comic series; we`d like to proceed immediately with production of the next project on the list, which is a 26 episode Flash Animated video series entitled; ""C.D.U.L.O. : The Outer Rim"" (details below in the Extended Projects Overview) plus finish writing the second novel of the series!For that to happen, we sincerely need Your support!Keith Gutierrez - Comic Artist / IllustratorHi!
 I’ve been doing illustrations for more than 10 years. As an avid fan of
 comic books/manga/graphic novels of all types, I don’t limit myself to a
 single genre, style or approach. I’m also a BIG fan of JRPGs, which 
give me a great deal of inspiration and ideas for my work. I like to 
push my limits with each new project I`m involved in to see how far can 
go. I sincerely believe that limiting one`s desire to progress would 
ultimately reduce one`s chances of learning new things; which in turn 
would cause their skills to rust. As a freelance graphic 
artist; I engage in commission based projects, concept art, portrait 
drawings, illustrations for children’s books, graphic designs for mobile
 games and applications, website artwork, logo designs, 3D modeling of 
buildings: exterior and interiors, etc.For more info and samples of my work, please feel free to check out my portfolio at:www.k-e-i-t-h.deviantart.comUndertaking
 this particular project has proven to be one of the most rewarding, 
challenging and fun learning experiences I`ve had in quite a while! The 
depth of the storyline and characters as well as the sheer scale of this
 overall project have given me a very rare opportunity to cut-loose and 
dive much deeper into exploring my artistic talents. We really do have a
 lot in store for you with this so I`m looking forward to completing 
this series and making it a HUGE success! But as mentioned in the
 video above; for that to happen we desperately need your help; 
therefore, I`d like to thank you all in advance for your contributions 
and support!Chadvar Yordanov - Comic Artist / Illustrator / AnimatorWhat you need to know about me probably can`t be found on a piece of paper; well at least not in words. I prefer to let my portfolio speak for itself. But to provide a little background; I finished a degree in traditional animation in 2012 and have been working as a freelance animator ever since. I specialize in concept art, storyboards and comic book illustrations and consistently complete works for various clients. I am an over-achiever with a tendency to put all my energy into my work. I`m always seeking new challenges, in order to improve my skills, while fueling my creativity with self-criticism, caffeine and nicotine. In the words of the famous Charles Bukowski: ""Find something you love and let it kill you"", that`s basically how I live.To give you an idea of the quality of work your contributions will assist in adding to this project, feel free to stop by the links below and check out  samples of my work. This is the real McCoy; everything else is fugazy... fairy dust. Meaning that it doesn't really matter.http://vimeo.com/chavdaryordanovhttp://vimeo.com/chavdaryordanovLike the other members of our team, I am also a big fan anime and manga, particularly the titles from the 80s and 90s that I grew up with. I love colorful characters, inventive and often crazy designs and the depth of stories with vast worlds to explore! Stories with a lot of fast-paced action will keep me glued to my seat for hours on end and “Project Wild FIRE” is no exception. After all, the main reasons I got involved in with The Ryukage project in the first place is because all these aspects are present in almost unhealthy doses!If you find yourself reminiscing about the golden age of comics and anime; the days of lively and believable characters with deep and exciting story lines, or if you constantly find yourself asking - ""Why don't they make them like that anymore?""; then this is the project that you should keep your eye on and support to your fullest capacity, because we really do have quite a lot of jaw-dropping excitement in store for you with this one. Support us and see watch us deliver a story that will both shake and satisfy you to the core!Walter S. Ragland, Jr.  - Author / Creative DirectorHello, I`m the creator of the Wild FIRE series, iOS Applications / Game Developer and CEO of cre8tive Media Vault. You can learn more about me from my LinkedIn profile below:http://jp.linkedin.com/pub/walter-ragland/4/1b0/928Wild FIRE
 originally started off as a simple video game concept back in the late 
1980`s and I`ve been working on this project now for over 20 years. Most
 of the content that you will find on the website or in the Extended Projects section were created by me in my spare time after working hours. That`s because I really love this story! After
 an unexpected trip to the ER here in Tokyo at the end of 2012 (Nothing 
too serious and I`m 100% fine now), I decided to dedicate the rest of my
 life and energy to creating all of the wonderful things that I have 
locked away in my vivid imagination! After a brief search, 
I`ve managed to track down some old friends of mine who are just as 
crazy and passionate about creating as I am. We have the same artistic 
aspirations - so here we are!I want this project to not only be 
one that inspires a new wave of creativity in our mainstream media; but 
also something that encourages people to be their best and leave 
something of value behind for those who will come after us. This project
 is just the beginning of that journey.Your contributions would 
hopefully be the catalyst to inspire a new generation of creative people
 with ideas and the courage to move us into a brighter future!A video message from the author:""Just Create! - Discovering Yourself Before You Die""FOR CONTRIBUTING TO THIS PROJECT, YOU WOULD RECEIVE (See Sidebar For More Details):*** The Top 25 Contributors will receive special mention as well as advertisement space at the top of our Wild FIRE Website - Reserved just for You!

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>SOS Volume 2 is a <strong>55-page</strong> black &amp; white graphic novel that contains issues #5-7 of a limited series. SOS is a black comedy/action series that chronicles the misadventures of three brothers who were former super-soldiers in World War II in a program called the Supernatural Offensive Squad.</p>
<p>In Volume 1, monsters from a dimension called the Abyss threatened New York. The brothers formed a monster-hunting business called SOS to combat the interdimensional threat.</p>
<p>In Volume 2, the brothers now deal with extraterrestrial threats when they are transported to planet Ventron. Ventron is a hellish world ruled by the sadistic Queen Lizbella where prisoners are made to fight to the death!</p>

<p><strong>Background:</strong></p>
<p>I created the concept for SOS back in 2005 based on the comics, movies, and animated shows I enjoyed as a kid. I want ""SOS"" to embody the spirit of entertainment from the 90's and early 2000's. TMNT, X-Men, Justice League TAS, Jackie Chan Adventures, Hellboy, Spawn, and Hellsing were the biggest influences for this series.</p>
<p>Over the years, I fleshed out the characters and plot, so I would create the best series I possibly could. With your support, I will bring to life Volume 2 of ""SOS"" which takes the brothers into outer space. There they fight aliens and learn more about their origins.</p>

</div></div>","Overview
SOS Volume 2 is a 55-page black & white graphic novel that contains issues #5-7 of a limited series. SOS is a black comedy/action series that chronicles the misadventures of three brothers who were former super-soldiers in World War II in a program called the Supernatural Offensive Squad.
In Volume 1, monsters from a dimension called the Abyss threatened New York. The brothers formed a monster-hunting business called SOS to combat the interdimensional threat.
In Volume 2, the brothers now deal with extraterrestrial threats when they are transported to planet Ventron. Ventron is a hellish world ruled by the sadistic Queen Lizbella where prisoners are made to fight to the death!

Background:
I created the concept for SOS back in 2005 based on the comics, movies, and animated shows I enjoyed as a kid. I want ""SOS"" to embody the spirit of entertainment from the 90's and early 2000's. TMNT, X-Men, Justice League TAS, Jackie Chan Adventures, Hellboy, Spawn, and Hellsing were the biggest influences for this series.
Over the years, I fleshed out the characters and plot, so I would create the best series I possibly could. With your support, I will bring to life Volume 2 of ""SOS"" which takes the brothers into outer space. There they fight aliens and learn more about their origins.








Ashcan
The 20-page ashcan contains two bonus chapters where SOS fight their rogue's gallery of villains.

<h2>Why Comics?</h2>
<p><br/>Why should socialists and communists care about comics? For us, the answer is simple - comics are where the people are.</p>
<p>Since 2008, a once-niche corner of popular culture has expanded rapidly - providing a near endless supply of spectacle, merchandise and ideology. People flock to see the latest movie, people cosplay and people read comic books in print and on their tablets and phones. Thousands if not millions of socialists already engage with a form of literature and theatre that insidiously reproduces the ideology of the ruling class. Steve is a military super weapon wrapped in a flag. Tony is the archetypal American industrialist and arms dealer. Thor is a monarchistic  deity. It goes on. Socialists have two choices - we can either shun this fandom, or we can accept it as a modern phenomenon and insist it be placed in a proper social context. Everything is ideological. Explaining that is important and rewarding work.<br/><br/>But this is not some joyless nitpick - we love comics. We love how outlandish, absurd and problematic they are, and beneath that all, so many comic books are legitimately wonderful and unique. Navigating the morality and political aspect of comics is a challenge. To meet that challenge, we're creating Four Colors Red: a series of zines and, we hope, podcasts. With your help we can  push this project as far as it can go.<br/><br/><strong>Dr Trevor Strunk </strong>is Philadelphia's Master Of Menace. His podcast No Cartridge Audio has built a space for leftists to enjoy and explore the hobby of video gaming in reactionary and troubled times. He's begun to explore the world of the Fighting Game Community with your help. Now he's asking for that help again: to launch a year long program of comics criticism that makes sense of another inscrutable and surreal facet of fan culture. He'd also really, really like to talk to you about how much he likes Bone.<br/><br/>For our first year, Four Colors Red will break down into six major case studies. The core of each case will be an electronically published zine of no less than 32 pages. If we can hit our first stretch goal, we’ll produce a podcast for each, where Trevor and guests interrogate each subject in the same dynamically dialectic fashion No-Cartridge subscribers have come to expect. If we can go further, we hope to do podcasts featuring comics creators and even take a no-holds barred look at  fan favourite Achewood, free for everyone! Keep checking back for our stretch goals!</p>
<p><i>Disclaimer: Four Colors Red is a fair use educational and critical project. All copyrights and trademarks are assigned to the original owners.</i><br/><br/><strong>ISSUE #1:  MEGACITY: THE THATCHER YEARS</strong><br/><br/>What better way to explore the connection between comics and the radical right than beginning with Judge Dredd? Starting development just after Margaret Thatcher became leader of the British opposition in 1975, Dredd spent the next 15 years in a cycle of dark social satire and redemptive heroic science fiction - torn between social commentary and commercial concerns. Every time Dredd would get too fascistic and repressive, a fantastic and existential threat would arise - climaxing in Necropolis, City Of The Dead, and a showdown with  his alien Nemesis, Judge Death. A month later, Thatcher was gone - leaving a broken and divided UK in her wake. This zine will provide a history of the first 13 years of Dredd stories against a backdrop of government repression and social decline, as well as examining the fandom that still surrounds Thatcherism to this day. This is a fantastic way to learn about Judge Dredd and the collapse of the post-war consensus, particularly for American readers.<br/><br/><strong>ISSUE #2: ADVENTURE CAPITALIST</strong><br/><br/>Do you ever wonder what union rights are like in the world of Stark? Who actually builds the suits? Does any of this actually make sense? Stan Lee once described Iron Man as the political comic of the Marvel age - a politics rooted in anticommunism, imperialism and a magical capitalism divorced from both economy and ecological cost. Using the original Tales Of Suspense run, the Matt Fraction film era run and the early issues of the current Dan Slott jawn as our texts, we'll go all in on the cool exec with the heart of steel, pulling no punches. What do the heroic adventures of a shameless industrialist mean in the world after Jobs and Musk? What compels a grown man to show up at an active rescue operation with an unsolicited minisubmarine? If you've ever wanted to imagine what a technocratic superhero would be like in the real world, you have so many horrifying examples today - we're going to tie it all together.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>ISSUE #3 SYNTHPOP VS THE DARK GODS</strong><br/><br/>Returning to 2000ad, we examine Grant Morrison and Steve Yeowell's seminal take on superheroes in the 1980s: Zenith! We’ll explore 1980s pop and melancholy , MKULTRA, Cthulhu, Acid House. Michael Heseltine, creators rights, the thin line between superhuman and god as well as offer our take on the eternal wizard war between Morrison and Alan Moore! One of the finest examples of revisionist superhero storytelling from the 1980s is also the least discovered. This zine is really going places. Not to be missed!<br/><br/><strong>ISSUE #4: AT HOME, WITH BONE</strong><br/><br/>Carl Barks. Bill Parker and CC Beck. Jack Cole. Will Eisner. And, of course, Jeff Smith. Wait, really?<br/><br/>Really; no Mount Rushmore of comics that make you feel like a happy child on Christmas is complete without the one young gun who every millennial comic book fan grew up with. Jeff Smith's Bone embraces the cartoon sensibilities of Barks' classic Uncle Scrooge books, the swashbuckling spirit of Parker and Beck's Captain Marvel, the troubled mania of Cole's Plastic Man and the experimental architecture of Eisner's Spirit and wraps it in a fantasia worthy of the name. How did a comic that embraces innocence and adventure land at all in the era of Desert Storm, Kosovo bombings, election fraud, 9/11, and the Iraq War? Why does this mix of Pogo and Moebius appeal to the child and adult in you all at once? And what about adventure pure in spirit speaks to the socialist project? Get ready to hope again.<br/><br/><strong>ISSUE #5: ODINSON OR FAILSON?</strong><br/><br/>Jack Kirby and Walt Simonson have grasped something about the mythology of comics that so few people seem to understand. They aren't about power fantasies. They aren't about humanising the gods. They aren't even about mythology. Comic books like Thor are about putting the omnipotent figures we have crafted as human beings into our real world to see what, exactly, might happen. And what happens? Rainbow bridges. A son’s endless quest to please a distant and disdainful father. Frog Thor. A space horse who takes over when Thor taps out. FROG THOR. As Norse Mythology is left fragmented and incomplete, so Thor can fill the gaps with carnival glee, revealing the roots of our anxieties, ambitions, dreams, and potential as people. But only if embraced in a spirit of revolt.</p>
<p><br/><strong>ISSUE #6: MODERN LOVE, MODERN ROCKETS</strong></p>
<p><br/>What is the Millennial Ulysses? A lot of people would tell you it's been written by a Franzen, Copeland or Zadie Smith. They would be wrong. The time-strewn, international, messy, tragi-comic Love and Rockets laid the ground for dozens of magic realist webcomics and helped define a whole generation of self-published artists and creators. Jaime and Gilberto Hernandez have created in this massive anthology a tale which alternates between Archie Comics and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, layered with a DIY ethic and the history of an America we see the current president and government so fomenting against. What does a truly global future look like when we remove the false peace of cosmopolitan compromise?</p>
<p>NOTE: All zines will be offered at six dollars a pop upon release. Help us raise the funds we need and get a nice discount!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Stretch Goal #1: $3000 - PODCASTS!</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>If we can break 2k, we can make these zines. If we can break 3k, every zine will get a supporting podcast! Podcasts will be offered à la carte or with a season pass. We’ll start announcing prospective guests and filling the details as we approach our funding goals! We have more ideas for podcasts and other stretch goals too. Keep checking back.</p>
<h2>
<br/>We Need Your Support!</h2> <p>Making these is going to require your help. Even publishing the zines electronically is going to be a big ask. That's why it's important this project receives enough funding to allow us to devote the care and attention it needs. Turning down freelance work to burn the midnight oil on a zine, SSL certificates for websites and even small treats like a coffee all add up. If you can fund us to $2,000, we can start this up.

</div></div>","Why Comics?
Why should socialists and communists care about comics? For us, the answer is simple - comics are where the people are.
Since 2008, a once-niche corner of popular culture has expanded rapidly - providing a near endless supply of spectacle, merchandise and ideology. People flock to see the latest movie, people cosplay and people read comic books in print and on their tablets and phones. Thousands if not millions of socialists already engage with a form of literature and theatre that insidiously reproduces the ideology of the ruling class. Steve is a military super weapon wrapped in a flag. Tony is the archetypal American industrialist and arms dealer. Thor is a monarchistic  deity. It goes on. Socialists have two choices - we can either shun this fandom, or we can accept it as a modern phenomenon and insist it be placed in a proper social context. Everything is ideological. Explaining that is important and rewarding work.But this is not some joyless nitpick - we love comics. We love how outlandish, absurd and problematic they are, and beneath that all, so many comic books are legitimately wonderful and unique. Navigating the morality and political aspect of comics is a challenge. To meet that challenge, we're creating Four Colors Red: a series of zines and, we hope, podcasts. With your help we can  push this project as far as it can go.Dr Trevor Strunk is Philadelphia's Master Of Menace. His podcast No Cartridge Audio has built a space for leftists to enjoy and explore the hobby of video gaming in reactionary and troubled times. He's begun to explore the world of the Fighting Game Community with your help. Now he's asking for that help again: to launch a year long program of comics criticism that makes sense of another inscrutable and surreal facet of fan culture. He'd also really, really like to talk to you about how much he likes Bone.For our first year, Four Colors Red will break down into six major case studies. The core of each case will be an electronically published zine of no less than 32 pages. If we can hit our first stretch goal, we’ll produce a podcast for each, where Trevor and guests interrogate each subject in the same dynamically dialectic fashion No-Cartridge subscribers have come to expect. If we can go further, we hope to do podcasts featuring comics creators and even take a no-holds barred look at  fan favourite Achewood, free for everyone! Keep checking back for our stretch goals!
Disclaimer: Four Colors Red is a fair use educational and critical project. All copyrights and trademarks are assigned to the original owners.ISSUE #1:  MEGACITY: THE THATCHER YEARSWhat better way to explore the connection between comics and the radical right than beginning with Judge Dredd? Starting development just after Margaret Thatcher became leader of the British opposition in 1975, Dredd spent the next 15 years in a cycle of dark social satire and redemptive heroic science fiction - torn between social commentary and commercial concerns. Every time Dredd would get too fascistic and repressive, a fantastic and existential threat would arise - climaxing in Necropolis, City Of The Dead, and a showdown with  his alien Nemesis, Judge Death. A month later, Thatcher was gone - leaving a broken and divided UK in her wake. This zine will provide a history of the first 13 years of Dredd stories against a backdrop of government repression and social decline, as well as examining the fandom that still surrounds Thatcherism to this day. This is a fantastic way to learn about Judge Dredd and the collapse of the post-war consensus, particularly for American readers.ISSUE #2: ADVENTURE CAPITALISTDo you ever wonder what union rights are like in the world of Stark? Who actually builds the suits? Does any of this actually make sense? Stan Lee once described Iron Man as the political comic of the Marvel age - a politics rooted in anticommunism, imperialism and a magical capitalism divorced from both economy and ecological cost. Using the original Tales Of Suspense run, the Matt Fraction film era run and the early issues of the current Dan Slott jawn as our texts, we'll go all in on the cool exec with the heart of steel, pulling no punches. What do the heroic adventures of a shameless industrialist mean in the world after Jobs and Musk? What compels a grown man to show up at an active rescue operation with an unsolicited minisubmarine? If you've ever wanted to imagine what a technocratic superhero would be like in the real world, you have so many horrifying examples today - we're going to tie it all together. 
ISSUE #3 SYNTHPOP VS THE DARK GODSReturning to 2000ad, we examine Grant Morrison and Steve Yeowell's seminal take on superheroes in the 1980s: Zenith! We’ll explore 1980s pop and melancholy , MKULTRA, Cthulhu, Acid House. Michael Heseltine, creators rights, the thin line between superhuman and god as well as offer our take on the eternal wizard war between Morrison and Alan Moore! One of the finest examples of revisionist superhero storytelling from the 1980s is also the least discovered. This zine is really going places. Not to be missed!ISSUE #4: AT HOME, WITH BONECarl Barks. Bill Parker and CC Beck. Jack Cole. Will Eisner. And, of course, Jeff Smith. Wait, really?Really; no Mount Rushmore of comics that make you feel like a happy child on Christmas is complete without the one young gun who every millennial comic book fan grew up with. Jeff Smith's Bone embraces the cartoon sensibilities of Barks' classic Uncle Scrooge books, the swashbuckling spirit of Parker and Beck's Captain Marvel, the troubled mania of Cole's Plastic Man and the experimental architecture of Eisner's Spirit and wraps it in a fantasia worthy of the name. How did a comic that embraces innocence and adventure land at all in the era of Desert Storm, Kosovo bombings, election fraud, 9/11, and the Iraq War? Why does this mix of Pogo and Moebius appeal to the child and adult in you all at once? And what about adventure pure in spirit speaks to the socialist project? Get ready to hope again.ISSUE #5: ODINSON OR FAILSON?Jack Kirby and Walt Simonson have grasped something about the mythology of comics that so few people seem to understand. They aren't about power fantasies. They aren't about humanising the gods. They aren't even about mythology. Comic books like Thor are about putting the omnipotent figures we have crafted as human beings into our real world to see what, exactly, might happen. And what happens? Rainbow bridges. A son’s endless quest to please a distant and disdainful father. Frog Thor. A space horse who takes over when Thor taps out. FROG THOR. As Norse Mythology is left fragmented and incomplete, so Thor can fill the gaps with carnival glee, revealing the roots of our anxieties, ambitions, dreams, and potential as people. But only if embraced in a spirit of revolt.
ISSUE #6: MODERN LOVE, MODERN ROCKETS
What is the Millennial Ulysses? A lot of people would tell you it's been written by a Franzen, Copeland or Zadie Smith. They would be wrong. The time-strewn, international, messy, tragi-comic Love and Rockets laid the ground for dozens of magic realist webcomics and helped define a whole generation of self-published artists and creators. Jaime and Gilberto Hernandez have created in this massive anthology a tale which alternates between Archie Comics and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, layered with a DIY ethic and the history of an America we see the current president and government so fomenting against. What does a truly global future look like when we remove the false peace of cosmopolitan compromise?
NOTE: All zines will be offered at six dollars a pop upon release. Help us raise the funds we need and get a nice discount!
 
Stretch Goal #1: $3000 - PODCASTS!
 
If we can break 2k, we can make these zines. If we can break 3k, every zine will get a supporting podcast! Podcasts will be offered à la carte or with a season pass. We’ll start announcing prospective guests and filling the details as we approach our funding goals! We have more ideas for podcasts and other stretch goals too. Keep checking back.

We Need Your Support! Making these is going to require your help. Even publishing the zines electronically is going to be a big ask. That's why it's important this project receives enough funding to allow us to devote the care and attention it needs. Turning down freelance work to burn the midnight oil on a zine, SSL certificates for websites and even small treats like a coffee all add up. If you can fund us to $2,000, we can start this up. If we can get it to $3,000, we can broaden our scope considerably and produce a worthy sister podcast to No-Cartridge while ensuring both receive the funds they need and keeping Trevor from having to subsist on a diet of wild flowers and morning dew. This is a true passion project, years in the making, and each of our reward tiers comes with some form of product for you. Help us create a self-funded voice and resource for the comics reading left in 2019 and we will reward you with senses-shattering discourse.

It's all very low budget and basically home made. I work at an elementary school with grades 1 through 3 and in class I have been teaching the kids how to make comics and films and other creative things like that, I have been helping kids make so many comics this year and they always ask me to show them my comics. The truth is the last 15 years or so I have been mostly concentrating on my films, and haven't done too much in the way of comic making. I still have my favourite characters and all the adventures and worlds I created growing up in my head, so I decided that this summer (since I wouldn't be working) I would spend the summer making a big epic comic.. something not too grown up that I could end up showing the kids in my class as an example, and to get them even more excited to see that things can be accomplished. </p>

<p>This is why we've decided to turn to IndiGoGo (and you guys!) in hopes of raising the funds to get this project off the ground.

We are FUNDED! In less than 4 days you guys have helped us hit our Indiegogo comic project goal! We are completely blown away THANK YOU! ♥ Every extra bit of funding will go into the book, packaging and shipping of the rewards, and future reprints of this project. Thank you so much for your support! We could not have done this without you.

Who are we?
Katie Shanahan is a cartoonist from Toronto, Canada. She's worked in the animation industry for the past 5 years as a storyboard artist, animator and designer, and keeps an active online presence with frequent art and comic updates.

Steven ""Shaggy"" Shanahan is a motion graphic animator, video editor, and compositor, who's early interest in radio plays lead to him creating a humorous audio short in 2005, called Silly Kingdom.


About ""Silly Kingdom"" the radio play

The first chapter, titled ""Alengrimrickshaw's 211th Birthday"", follows the efforts of a cheerful Princess, a power hungry Prince, and a clever Jester, as they attempt to put on a birthday celebration for the Kingdom's ancient and crotchety jerk-of-a-wizard, Alengrimrickshaw. Sufficed to say, things take a turn for the explosive!

Following the audio drama, many more short stories set in the world of Silly Kingdom have been written, and now, they are ready to be told with the launching of Katie and Shaggy's newest collaborative comic, Silly Kingdom.


About ""Silly Kingdom"" the comic!
Taking inspiration from the radio play, the comic will be a 32 page (approx) black and white inked humor fantasy illustrated by Katie and written by Shaggy. Suitable for all audiences (of awesome readers!)

With published works printed in critically acclaimed comic anthologies (""Flight"" volumes 7 and 8, ""The Anthology Project"" volume 2 and ""Side B: A Music Lover's Comic Anthology""), Silly Kingdom marks the Shanahan sibling's first self published work, which they aim to premier at the upcoming San Diego Comic-Con and Tr!ckster in July.  

What We Need & What You Get
The accumulated price of printing the first run of Silly Kingdom books ($600), the flight from Toronto to San Diego and back ($1,260), and accommodations for the convention ($840) is a bit of a strain on a freelancer artist's budget. The whole endeavor is going to run us a total of $3,100.

This is why we've decided to turn to IndiGoGo (and you guys!) in hopes of raising the funds to get this project off the ground. In return for your support we'll reward you with a bevy of perks, such as shout-outs, buttons, prints, original art commissions (fan-art, yourself drawn in Katie's style, whatever you want!) and of course, the comic itself.

We are also offering access to a new live stream series called Shanahanigans which will follow the behind-the-scenes of our present and future comic projects.  Watch Katie draw, hear Shaggy yammer on, and you the viewer can get involved with questions, and maybe even requests!

You can also get access to the Silly Kingdom art blog, where you can follow the progress from thumbnails to final page, see the evolution of character and location design, and gain insights into the comic making process.

What if we exceed our goal?
That would be fantastic! Every extra bit of money will go into packaging and shipping of the comics and rewards to you guys! Anything above that will go into printing more Silly Kingdom books in the future, so we can bring them around to other comic convention we'll be attending!



What if we don't meet our goal?
We're still going to print this comic because we're both really excited about it. It'll just take us longer to build up some money to mail out all the comics and rewards as shipping fees will have to come from our own pockets.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p><u>Who is Little Charlie Rose?</u>  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>...  He's a little guy who may or may not bear some resemblance to a great broadcaster, though any resemblance is a tribute and strictly a result of parody.  He's a guy who loves to hit the town.  Little New York is still pretty big.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Little Charlie loves going to parties but struggles to get the invites.  He is still hip though he needs a new hip.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>He's got a sense of humor but doesn't much like being at the center of a practical joke.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The show satirizes Big Media, the Establishment, some of our own beloved Artists, and takes on both High and Low Culture.  </p>

<p><u>Who the Hell are we?</u></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The show is produced by a group of comedians and webheads who shall be known as Dwayne Membrane and Friends.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Season 1 kinda...  emphasis on kinda...  Took off.  Episode 106, featuring Little Dr. Drew Pinsky, received the following praise from Elaine Liner, who is actually a published writer and heretofore unbeknownst to us.  ""Funny!  Strange!""  (From her twitter feed:  Elaine is ""Theater critic/feature writer, Dallas Observer; Flip filmmaker, photographer, public speaker, native Texan""...).  </p>

<h2 style=""margin-left:40px;"">Tara's Tale</h2>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>When Tara was nine her father died and she was adopted by the Satos, owners of multi-million dollar enterprise Mirai Systems. Ten years later, the young woman once again had fate abruptly pull the rug from under her feet.</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Faced with a situation she could never have dreamed of, threatened by those she had considered friends, Tara had to make a choice. So she put on a mask and cape, becoming someone who could do what no one else seemed prepared to - protect Costa City and fight those who exploit it for their own ends.</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>She became Lady Phantom.</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>This is her story.</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;text-align: center;"">***</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">With Lady Phantom we are looking to create a classic vigilante tale updated for today. We want to create a rich and believable world with a lot of diversity, realistic and varied characters, and a back-drop of current issues and politics - hopefully without stereotyping or sugar-coating.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Our story takes place in Costa City - a (mostly) fictional harbor city on the Oregon coast; a city with strong Japanese connections and long time history of racial prejudice, brought to the boiling point by the current political climate. During the series we will touch on such subjects as racism, sexism, lgbtq-issues, ethics and morals, corruption, and violence from those who are supposed to protect us.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Lady Phantom lives in a very real world, and the real world isn't always a pretty place. It isn't always easy to distinguish the heroes from the villains - almost no one is all good or all evil - and our story and characters should hopefully reflect that.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We want to entertain you, but we also want to make people think, and we want to present a multi-faceted and modern vigilante story that isn't afraid to deal with controversial and difficult issues. We want a main character who is human, relatable, flawed - but who can still be a good role model.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">This will not all happen immediately, of course - a comic book issue can only hold so much. Our plans are long term and bigger than a single story arc, and as the story progresses you should see more and more facets of both the characters and the world around them.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;text-align: center;"">***</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">You can download our prequel, Lady Phantom Issue Zero, and read the story of how Tara started on the path to becoming a vigilante:</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;text-align: center;"">Issue Zero is also available to read in the comichaus app, and all six issues of the mini-series will see digital release there before it becomes available anywhere else!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;text-align: center;""><a href=""http://comichaus.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525596444/vbt4hx4zllj6s5g1mze9.png"" src=""""/></a></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;text-align: center;"">In the upcoming mini-series we get to follow Tara as she takes to the streets in pursuit of the elusive Poet - a key figure in Costa City's underworld - in order to get to the bottom of the weapon smuggling that has taken place through her father's company. We will also follow Detective Darko of the CCPD as he investigates the claims of a costumed vigilante on the streets of Costa City.</p>
<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;"">Work in Progress</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We have been working on the Lady Phantom mini-series for two years now, and the script for the first six issues is pretty much complete. In addition, we have an outline and ideas to continue the story in another twelve issues, divided into two six issue story arcs.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Issue Zero has already seen print in a once-in-a-lifetime limited and numbered edition of 250 copies. Once these are gone there will never be any more, so if you haven't secured a copy for yourself already make sure to check out our perks below!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525597171/gwprcls3m0rrkpwhokpi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The pencils for Issue One are done and our artist Thomas is busy doing inks and color. Issues Two through Four have been laid out with thumbnails and rough art, and layout is in progress on Issue Five, and when everything is done we will collect all six issues in a Trade Paperback.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">All in all we have the script and layouts for roughly 170 pages of content divided over six issues, plus ideas and outlines for an additional 350 or so pages, for a total of OVER FIVE HUNDRED comic book pages! Phew!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">A massive undertaking, and that's why we need some help!</p>
<h2 style=""margin-left:40px;"">Creative Team</h2>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">The core team behind Lady Phantom is a somewhat unlikely duo - American writer Julie K Taylor and Swedish artist R Thomas Allwin.</p>
<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;text-align: right;"">
<u><strong>J</strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525501899/nqc1ss7z64bdevonegxt.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/><strong>ulie K Taylor</strong></u> - <i>Creator &amp; Writer</i>
</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;text-align: right;"">Julie is the brains behind the character, story and world of Lady Phantom. Without her, this comic would never have existed. She is a mixed race single mother who lives in Wisconsin, USA with her children, writing whenever she gets a chance between work and studies.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;text-align: right;"">The idea for Lady Phantom started as a novel, but she quickly realized that she wanted to make it into a comic instead. As a fan of superheroes and a mother of three, she saw the need for strong black female leads to serve as role models and idols for young girls and boys of color.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:80px;text-align: right;""> </p>
<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;"">
<strong><u>R Thomas Allwin</u></strong> - <i>Artist &amp; Co-creator</i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525501935/ivyapaqabzduaindgp7r.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right;""/>
</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Thomas is the one responsible for the visual interpretation of the characters, locations and style of Lady Phantom. He lives just south of Stockholm, Sweden with his girlfriend and their child, working part time driving trains and dividing the rest of his time between his family and his business as a self-employed artist.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">When Julie sent out the call for artists interested in working on Lady Phantom, he was hesitant at taking on such a massive project, but after hearing her pitch and her ideas he knew that there was no way he could pass. Quickly, his role extended to co-creator and together the two worked on the story and the characters while Julie wrote the script.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;text-align: center;"">***</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i><strong>Proofreading and Editing</strong></i><br/>In addition to our core dynamic duo, we are also working closely with proofreader and editor <strong>Moriarti Shankweiler </strong>- linguistics major and avid comic book reader - to make sure Lady Phantom keeps a professional standard.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i><strong>Guest Cover Artist</strong></i><br/>And we are very excited to introduce seasoned comics creator and illustrator <strong>Robert Sammelin</strong> as our first guest cover artist! Robert is Concept Art Director at DICE and has done a lot of comic book covers for Boom! studios, in addition to his work on several major video game lines. Check out some of his work here and see why we are so excited to have him on board!</p>

<p style=""margin-left:40px;text-align: center;"">***</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">We really look forward to bringing you the story of Lady Phantom and we hope it will have something for everyone - but don't give it to your kids, at least not the younger ones. There WILL be swearing, foul language, and various adult subjects. But we are not going to be unnecessarily explicit, so mature teenagers (I know, that sounds like an oxymoron, but they are out there!) could be a potential audience.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525499475/jswzcroqm8dlqn6qwcdc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2 style=""margin-left:40px;"">Your Assistance!</h2>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">In order to make all this happen, we need you - the fans and hopefuls - to help us. Don't get us wrong here, we believe in ourselves and Issues One through Six along with the collected TPB WILL happen. We are fully funded and so all of our initial expenses are already paid for. We will publish everything digitally and make small print runs for backers, selected stores, to sell at cons and online, and we will be very happy with that.<br/><br/>But Lady Phantom could be so much bigger; so much more.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">With your help as backers, signal boosters and supporters we are confident that we can build enough interest in Lady Phantom to keep the story going beyond issue six. Our ultimate goal is to get Lady Phantom into the Previews catalog and Diamond distribution so that it will be available for order everywhere - either as a self published comic under our own label or on an indie publisher - but that takes effort and a pretty big established audience.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">So if you like what you see and have faith in us, help spread the word so we can cover our expenses and really move forward with all of this. Even if you can't help back us with money, you can get the word out there and bring Lady Phantom to new eyes and minds - something which is so much more valuable in the long run!<br/><br/>You can do this by sharing our content on social media, but also by sharing Issue Zero - you are more than welcome to copy the pdf and send it to friends, family, strangers or enemies - anyone who might be interested - as long as you don't alter it or charge for it.</p>
<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;"">Budget Breakdown</h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">How will we use your money? I'm glad you asked!</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">Roughly 40 % of what we get will go to covering perk fulfillment as needed, about 20% will be invested in marketing and advertising, 10% go to covering fees, and the remaining 30% will go to cover the expenses and salaries of the Creative Team.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">As you can see, our primary concern right now isn't making a lot of money - we just want to cover our expenses while we produce and distribute our creation on a bigger scale and reach a bigger audience.</p>
<h3 style=""margin-left:40px;""><strong>Distribution Schedule</strong></h3>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">So, how will we go about fulfilling all of our promises, you ask? Well, the goal is to finish one issue every other month starting now in June and going until July next year. Of course, we know how life has a tendency to interfere with the best laid plans, and so we have given ourselves an extra two months to get everything together.</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;"">If you throw your hat in with us, this is when you can expect your stuff:</p>

</div></div>","Tara's Tale
When Tara was nine her father died and she was adopted by the Satos, owners of multi-million dollar enterprise Mirai Systems. Ten years later, the young woman once again had fate abruptly pull the rug from under her feet.
Faced with a situation she could never have dreamed of, threatened by those she had considered friends, Tara had to make a choice. So she put on a mask and cape, becoming someone who could do what no one else seemed prepared to - protect Costa City and fight those who exploit it for their own ends.
She became Lady Phantom.
This is her story.
***
With Lady Phantom we are looking to create a classic vigilante tale updated for today. We want to create a rich and believable world with a lot of diversity, realistic and varied characters, and a back-drop of current issues and politics - hopefully without stereotyping or sugar-coating.
Our story takes place in Costa City - a (mostly) fictional harbor city on the Oregon coast; a city with strong Japanese connections and long time history of racial prejudice, brought to the boiling point by the current political climate. During the series we will touch on such subjects as racism, sexism, lgbtq-issues, ethics and morals, corruption, and violence from those who are supposed to protect us.
Lady Phantom lives in a very real world, and the real world isn't always a pretty place. It isn't always easy to distinguish the heroes from the villains - almost no one is all good or all evil - and our story and characters should hopefully reflect that.
We want to entertain you, but we also want to make people think, and we want to present a multi-faceted and modern vigilante story that isn't afraid to deal with controversial and difficult issues. We want a main character who is human, relatable, flawed - but who can still be a good role model.
This will not all happen immediately, of course - a comic book issue can only hold so much. Our plans are long term and bigger than a single story arc, and as the story progresses you should see more and more facets of both the characters and the world around them.
***
You can download our prequel, Lady Phantom Issue Zero, and read the story of how Tara started on the path to becoming a vigilante:

Issue Zero is also available to read in the comichaus app, and all six issues of the mini-series will see digital release there before it becomes available anywhere else!

In the upcoming mini-series we get to follow Tara as she takes to the streets in pursuit of the elusive Poet - a key figure in Costa City's underworld - in order to get to the bottom of the weapon smuggling that has taken place through her father's company. We will also follow Detective Darko of the CCPD as he investigates the claims of a costumed vigilante on the streets of Costa City.
Work in Progress
We have been working on the Lady Phantom mini-series for two years now, and the script for the first six issues is pretty much complete. In addition, we have an outline and ideas to continue the story in another twelve issues, divided into two six issue story arcs.
Issue Zero has already seen print in a once-in-a-lifetime limited and numbered edition of 250 copies. Once these are gone there will never be any more, so if you haven't secured a copy for yourself already make sure to check out our perks below!

The pencils for Issue One are done and our artist Thomas is busy doing inks and color. Issues Two through Four have been laid out with thumbnails and rough art, and layout is in progress on Issue Five, and when everything is done we will collect all six issues in a Trade Paperback.
All in all we have the script and layouts for roughly 170 pages of content divided over six issues, plus ideas and outlines for an additional 350 or so pages, for a total of OVER FIVE HUNDRED comic book pages! Phew!
A massive undertaking, and that's why we need some help!
Creative Team
The core team behind Lady Phantom is a somewhat unlikely duo - American writer Julie K Taylor and Swedish artist R Thomas Allwin.

Julie K Taylor - Creator & Writer

Julie is the brains behind the character, story and world of Lady Phantom. Without her, this comic would never have existed. She is a mixed race single mother who lives in Wisconsin, USA with her children, writing whenever she gets a chance between work and studies.
The idea for Lady Phantom started as a novel, but she quickly realized that she wanted to make it into a comic instead. As a fan of superheroes and a mother of three, she saw the need for strong black female leads to serve as role models and idols for young girls and boys of color.
 

R Thomas Allwin - Artist & Co-creator

Thomas is the one responsible for the visual interpretation of the characters, locations and style of Lady Phantom. He lives just south of Stockholm, Sweden with his girlfriend and their child, working part time driving trains and dividing the rest of his time between his family and his business as a self-employed artist.
When Julie sent out the call for artists interested in working on Lady Phantom, he was hesitant at taking on such a massive project, but after hearing her pitch and her ideas he knew that there was no way he could pass. Quickly, his role extended to co-creator and together the two worked on the story and the characters while Julie wrote the script.
***
Proofreading and EditingIn addition to our core dynamic duo, we are also working closely with proofreader and editor Moriarti Shankweiler - linguistics major and avid comic book reader - to make sure Lady Phantom keeps a professional standard.
Guest Cover ArtistAnd we are very excited to introduce seasoned comics creator and illustrator Robert Sammelin as our first guest cover artist! Robert is Concept Art Director at DICE and has done a lot of comic book covers for Boom! studios, in addition to his work on several major video game lines. Check out some of his work here and see why we are so excited to have him on board!

We really look forward to bringing you the story of Lady Phantom and we hope it will have something for everyone - but don't give it to your kids, at least not the younger ones. There WILL be swearing, foul language, and various adult subjects. But we are not going to be unnecessarily explicit, so mature teenagers (I know, that sounds like an oxymoron, but they are out there!) could be a potential audience.

Your Assistance!
In order to make all this happen, we need you - the fans and hopefuls - to help us. Don't get us wrong here, we believe in ourselves and Issues One through Six along with the collected TPB WILL happen. We are fully funded and so all of our initial expenses are already paid for. We will publish everything digitally and make small print runs for backers, selected stores, to sell at cons and online, and we will be very happy with that.But Lady Phantom could be so much bigger; so much more.
With your help as backers, signal boosters and supporters we are confident that we can build enough interest in Lady Phantom to keep the story going beyond issue six. Our ultimate goal is to get Lady Phantom into the Previews catalog and Diamond distribution so that it will be available for order everywhere - either as a self published comic under our own label or on an indie publisher - but that takes effort and a pretty big established audience.
So if you like what you see and have faith in us, help spread the word so we can cover our expenses and really move forward with all of this. Even if you can't help back us with money, you can get the word out there and bring Lady Phantom to new eyes and minds - something which is so much more valuable in the long run!You can do this by sharing our content on social media, but also by sharing Issue Zero - you are more than welcome to copy the pdf and send it to friends, family, strangers or enemies - anyone who might be interested - as long as you don't alter it or charge for it.
Budget Breakdown
How will we use your money? I'm glad you asked!
Roughly 40 % of what we get will go to covering perk fulfillment as needed, about 20% will be invested in marketing and advertising, 10% go to covering fees, and the remaining 30% will go to cover the expenses and salaries of the Creative Team.
As you can see, our primary concern right now isn't making a lot of money - we just want to cover our expenses while we produce and distribute our creation on a bigger scale and reach a bigger audience.
Distribution Schedule
So, how will we go about fulfilling all of our promises, you ask? Well, the goal is to finish one issue every other month starting now in June and going until July next year. Of course, we know how life has a tendency to interfere with the best laid plans, and so we have given ourselves an extra two months to get everything together.
If you throw your hat in with us, this is when you can expect your stuff:

August 2018: pdf edition of Issue One
August 2018: physical edition of Issue One and other physical rewards that can be completed now.
September 2018: pdf edition of Issue Two.
October 2018: physical edition of Issue Two.

Risks and Challenges
So what could go wrong?Well, a lot. Anything can happen really, and we've already seen proof of how personal issues can affect the creation of a comic.
BUT...
...we are determined and confident, and we ARE doing this, no matter what!
Delays is the biggest risk we face - not being able to churn out pages at a fast enough pace to make our deadlines. We've given ourselves some leeway, but we are still running on a fairly tight schedule and juggling day jobs and families.
We'll get it done, though.
On time - or as close to it as is humanly possible.
What else can tie us up? Printing and shipping.
Costs can go up, delays can happen, packages can get lost. Shipping is already expensive and while we would love to offer traceable shipments it will get prohibitively expensive, especially for the subscribers who will receive six or seven separate packages. We aim to ship as safely and securely as possible, though, and we plan to replace or reimburse lost orders as far as possible.The risks to you should be low to non-existant. At worst, perhaps you'll have to wait a little bit longer than expected, but we WILL get you your comics!",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Imagine a book so clever, so funny AND so Catholic... Can you imagine it? Does it even exist in this fallen world?</p>
<p><strong>It does now!</strong></p>
<p>We have ventured to gather the most clever, Catholic cartoonists on the interwebs and bring them together to publish that very book. We call it:</p>
<p><strong>The Ultimate Catholic Comic Book</strong></p>
<p>This book is a compilation of work from cartoonists you know and love online. These artists are:</p>
<p><strong>Tom Gould - Tomics</strong></p>
<p>Tom Gould is a lifelong cartoonist with a soft-spot for puns, parodies, and religion. Combining the three was only a matter of time, and through the result – dubbed “Tomics” – he’s able to live the dream he’s had since he was a scribbling babe.</p>
<p>Tomics launched on Facebook in February of 2015. Since then, a strong following and community has grown around the comics. Below are a few favorites. You can also see more here: Facebook.com/tomicscomics/</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Jason Bach - Jason Bach Cartoons</strong></p>
<p>Jason Bach grew up in Portland, Oregon reading Calvin and Hobbes and dreaming of being a professional cartoonist. After getting a Bachelor's degree in Spanish and pursuing a Master's in Theology, he found success in 2012 with his ongoing series of Catholic cartoons. He has contributed work for many Catholic organizations, including Our Sunday Visitor, Sophia Institute Press, and Word on Fire Ministries. </p>
<p>You can see more of Jason's work here: Facebook.com/JasonBachCartoons/</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Pat Cross - Pat Cross Cartoons</strong></p>
<p>Pat loves drawing. He loves America. He loves the Big Man upstairs. His drawings are basically the result of putting these three elements into a petri dish and letting them brew for a few years. His hope is that you will find his work thought-provoking, insightful, profound and maybe, just maybe, a bit humorous.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>and introducing... </p>
<p><strong>John Smillie</strong></p>
<p>John Smillie is a young hobbyist animator and cartoonist. He enjoys sharing his stories, his sense of humor, and now his faith with the world. His cartoons are a mix of satire and fantastical storytelling with a balance between adorable and creepy. He shares his cartoons on Tumblr and Youtube.</p>
<p>His very first Catholic cartoon, The First Rosary, went viral online immediately. We are excited to have his new work featured in this book.</p>
<p><strong>Here are the details:</strong></p>
<p>This book will be comprised of work never-before-seen online, on the fridge, or anywhere else you could think of. All the comics will be drawn specifically for this book and it's beloved backers and readers.</p>
<p>We are aiming to have the book printed and shipped in the of spring of 2017, hopefully around May. This gives the artists ample time to put on their thinking caps and draw some inspiredwork of art. </p>
<p>We are planning on printing 500 books, but we would LOVE to print more! We will be able to print more books if we reach the original goal + stretch goals! If we are able to reach the funding goal and have leftover books, we will be selling them online and will work on getting them distributed to bookstores all over the country.</p>
<p>The Publisher</p>

<p>Allocation of funds received:</p>
<p>Here is the breakdown of how the money will be used:<br/>A majority of the budget, about 90%, will be towards printing the book, that's what this is all about! 9% will be allocated for fees encountered through Kickstarter and payment processing. The last small bit will be for miscellaneous payments helping get this campaign off the ground.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<p>The Ultimate Catholic Comic Book is in the beginning stages and we are ready to go. The talented artists are ready to draw their hearts out; we have a publisher lined up to print the book once it is ready; online distribution is ready; and bookstore distribution is in the works.

        AND WHAT ABOUT THE MONEY ?



If the goal isn't met everything that is donated  ( after fees and taxes ) will go towards the print costs and all of the funders will receive their packages - guaranteed !
Reaching the goal will cover cost of a 1000 books print run , Indiegogo share , money transfer fees and taxes . That amount also includes freight books to me , packaging and shipping to all of you .
Stretch goals sounds to crazy for me now but you never know .So all unexpected money will go towards adding more pages to the book. I have so many sketches I would like to share and they are left for Sketchbook #2 but with your help they can be published sooner than planned !",6.0,0,"2 Campaigns

To Become A Reality

London 1899. Steam billows out from every corner of the city
while huge Zeppelin airships float in the sky overhead, and Clockwork Servants,
the mechanical slaves that keep society ticking along, duck through the alleyways.



Welcome to the
Steampunk world of Clockwork Watch - a place where Victorian values collide
with anachronistic technology.
 
Clockwork Watch is an immersive story and participatory experience set in a
retro-futurist vision of Victorian England. The narrative is played out across
two graphic novels, interactive promenade theatre, live action role-play,
online adventures, an interactive book and a feature film.



Concept Painting of Clockwork Servant from Doodle to Finished Watercolour
With a creative team that has collectively been in the
driving seat of disruptive, innovative storytelling for over 5 years this
grassroots project looks to push the boundaries of
entertaining transmedia projects... 
But more about that later...



What's This About?
This appeal is to raise
printing fees for our first
graphic novel called - The Arrival. If we raise more than the target amount, it will be put towards developing the film script, launching our website, and developing the promenade performances.

The Arrival tells the story of a world struggling with technological and social change.  New models of  clockwork servants become ever-more advanced and human-clockwork hybridisation is the talk of the town; the clockworks are becoming more human, and not all humans are as human as they think they are.



Images of Chan Ranbir and Clockwork Servant

Our second graphic novel, called – The Breakaway, will open up the world and the cast of characters, soon to be seen with their own compelling stories being played out across different mediums. 

The world introduced in the graphic novels will be played out online, with audiences able to interact with artefacts from the storyworld and live action role play events.

This will culminate in the cast of characters taking up residence in The Old Vic Tunnels for a live event like no other- a one-off hybrid of interactive theatre, prohibition party, steampunk spectacle, and club night.


First Generation Clockwork Servant

The final ‘event piece’ is the feature film- a noir love story set in, you guessed it, steampunk London. Alongside which, we'll publish an interactive book by none other than Alison Norrington.

By funding the printing costs of The Arrival, you’ll also be contributing to the final graphic novel anthology, with contributions from artists, authors, and graphic novellists. Proceeds will be donated to a charity determined by members of our Facebook Group.

<p>The action-packed Cavewoman: Metal Age is a brand new, full color 2-issue series and the first official title launched under the new Amryl Dark Entertainment banner. This InDemand campaign will continue the successful Kickstarter launch of the first issue of the new series here on Indiegogo, and the second issue will follow shortly thereafter in follow up campaigns. Both issues are completely finished, lettered, and colored, so as soon as issue one is fulfilled to all backers, we will get underway with the follow up campaign for the exciting conclusion in issue #2! Both issues will be 24 pages of pure, action-packed story with no ads or filler!</p>
<p>We know that people have their preference of crowdfunding sites so we wanted to make our books available to fans on both of the main crowdfunding sites. Continuing our successful campaign here allows us to serve both communities. </p>

<p><i>Our fearless Cavewoman was first warned by Razor of an impending threat to literally everything in Cavewoman: Razor’s Run. A threat by the name of Malevolence, The Mother of Demons and she who rules over the realm of Limbo in the space between all worlds. Her power is growing and soon it will require every capable warrior across time, including our Cavewoman, to band together to stop her when the time comes. Is that time now?</i></p>
<p><i>Ever since that fateful meeting, Meriem has been haunted by nightmares of the horrors to come. Until one day, while on her morning hunt through the jungle, she comes across some demon minions of Malevolence intruding upon her lands thanks to a portal torn between her world and Limbo. With the threat now at her doorstep, she decides to take the fight to them and crosses over into Limbo, the realm beyond all. There she faces unspeakable evil, vile demon creatures, and human sacrifice! There will be blood, sweat, and of course, METAL! Join us for the Metal Age. It’ll be one hell of an adventure!</i></p>

<h3><strong>What we need &amp; what you get!</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>Cavewoman: Metal Age was set to solicit through Diamond Distribution for a standard release to all comic stores this summer, but due to COVID-19 that was all shut down and we needed to look into alternative avenues to get the product out to fans. We ultimately decided that crowdfunding would be our best way to get the books out and we hope you will support us here! </p>
<p>We have already written, drawn, and lettered the books. We do these comics upfront ""on spec"" and get paid on the backend after sales. So we aren't just looking to make enough money to just release the books, but to also pay the creative team for writing, drawing, coloring, and lettering the books. Without the normal chain of distribution through Diamond Distribution and comic stores, we need to take it to the people directly to get the story out and also get us all paid. <u>These books are done and ready to be printed and distributed.</u> This is why we need your help.</p>
<p><strong><u>These are being sold here similar to our other crowdfunding campaign, only with Indiegogo logos on back instead and all will also have titles on them as shown below.</u> Rather than running the usual full print run for either campaign, we are doing smaller, closed editions with each. So these editions are exclusive to Indiegogo and will be individually serially numbered with the print run count in a closed edition just for here, but the covers are essentially the same on the front. </strong></p>
<p>So we will run this InDemand campaign for 30 days and then we will print based on orders to make sure we keep the print numbers as low as possible for you! This will also allow us to be able to do some fun stretch goals, because we WANT you to get cool freebies! (check out the stretch goals further down!) After the campaign, we will go to print and deliver in October!</p>
<p><i><u><strong>What YOU get:</strong></u></i></p>
<p>The 7 incredible covers for Cavewoman: Metal Age #1 are done by some incredible indie comics talents including<strong> Andrew Mangum (covers A-C), Bill Maus (cover D), Budd Root (covers E &amp; F), and Izik Bell (cover G)!!! </strong>We have them available in both full color covers or the even more limited b&amp;w variants of each! We even have premium cover enhancements that are awesome looking and even more limited! All Premium Enhanced books are virgin covers! (scroll down further to see those)</p>
<p>As the main cover, Cover A will be the mass-market edition at $8 here and no print limit. Covers B-G variant covers are limited to 300 copies max (or less) and will be $15 each. The b&amp;w variant covers are the same prices as their colored counterparts, but are limited to only 150 copies max (or less). A digital PDF edition of the comic is <u><strong>free</strong></u> with any pledge level as well!</p>
<p><i>We also are doing a $10 custom blank sketch cover that will not be sold in stores and is just for these campaigns with the Indiegogo logo printed on the bottom front corner. We also have a limited supply of the fully b&amp;w Cavewoman: Metal Age #1 Fanexpo edition for $20. We printed 100 unnumbered copies of this special edition in advance for a convention we were supposed to do in March but was cancelled, so we are selling some of them in our campaigns. These have a pencil cover and b&amp;w interiors instead of full color like the regular books. All covers are shown below.</i></p>
<p><strong>**covers C &amp; D are the topless variants so they are censored below but will not be censored when printed**</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599715438/pcomypaeznojfj5p3zgu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>There is also a Premium SILVER Wraparound virgin cover edition that will form a large 4-cover image with the wraparound cover coming on Metal Age #2. It is only available in the Premium Silver and is not exclusive to either crowdfunding campaign, with no logos at all. </strong></p>
<p><i>This ONE cover will not be serially numbered because the other half of the image from issue #2's wraparound cover wouldn't match numbers anyway since they aren't being printed together.  <u>These will be limited to 200 copies each, but they won't be serially numbered like everything else, similar to the Fanexpo edition.</u></i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596688611/qdjdvj8bb9n42ajyc9ha.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Cover enhancement options available: </strong></p>
<p>We have some extremely nice cover enhancement options as well, only for our backers of the crowdfunding campaigns! So these WILL NOT be available in stores later, just like the sketch cover blank and the Fanexpo edition these are ONLY for these campaigns. The price on these is $50 each and we are limiting them to just 100 copies max of each or just limited to orders here, whichever is least. We did the same thing in the KS campaign and like those, the back covers will have the Indiegogo logo just for this campaign, and will be serially numbered with print count numbers on the front right bottom corner of each book.</p>
<p>We are offering enhancements in METAL, SILVER, GOLD, CHROME and CRYSTAL as cover enhancements! So below we have examples of SILVER on the extremely limited wraparound cover (the other half of the image will be a wraparound for issue 2), the Izik Bell cover G, and the Lords of Limbo 11x17 print. (the actual SILVER print will be 11x17 but the sample is smaller since it was just a sample)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596649648/vs1yfsr58izkzro6jcns.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Here are close up pics of each of the enhancements. <u><i>ALL ENHANCED BOOKS WILL HAVE VIRGIN COVERS WITHOUT ANY TITLES.</i></u> Shown here are CHROME, CRYSTAL, and SILVER for the wraparound cover. CHROME is like holofoil and rainbow in the light, CRYSTAL is very prismatic across the entire surface, and SILVER is very shiny like polished metallic chrome.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596649714/n3srvembuoq36zlkwstb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p><strong>Amryl Dark Entertainment</strong> in a new imprint of Amryl Entertainment, the longtime publisher of Cavewoman comics for over 2 decades. This new imprint is completely independent from Amryl Entertainment &amp; the Amryl Universe, and will offer a different, darker take on the Cavewoman character as well as explore the new shared universe with Razor and the returning London Night universe of characters that will soon be relaunching as well under Amryl Dark. This ""parallel world"" will be darker, the tales will be bigger, and the stories &amp; characters will connect in exciting new ways. Amryl Dark will change the status quo, but unlike most reboots we will not be throwing out the existing history of Cavewoman or Razor, but rather building upon what is already established  and taking that in a new and exciting direction. You are in for a wild ride with Amryl Dark Entertainment!</p>

<p>Our goal is to deliver fun, '90s-style comic books as opposed to the more traditional modern storytelling in comics that are ""written for trade"" and that slowly build over 6 issues or more to tell a story. Each series we do will be a 1 or 2-issue self contained story while also part of the larger whole of an interconnected universe.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We completely understand that not everyone can contribute to the campaign, but you can still help us out by sharing the project across social media, if you like what you see.

</div></div>","The action-packed Cavewoman: Metal Age is a brand new, full color 2-issue series and the first official title launched under the new Amryl Dark Entertainment banner. This InDemand campaign will continue the successful Kickstarter launch of the first issue of the new series here on Indiegogo, and the second issue will follow shortly thereafter in follow up campaigns. Both issues are completely finished, lettered, and colored, so as soon as issue one is fulfilled to all backers, we will get underway with the follow up campaign for the exciting conclusion in issue #2! Both issues will be 24 pages of pure, action-packed story with no ads or filler!
We know that people have their preference of crowdfunding sites so we wanted to make our books available to fans on both of the main crowdfunding sites. Continuing our successful campaign here allows us to serve both communities. 

Story synopsis:
Our fearless Cavewoman was first warned by Razor of an impending threat to literally everything in Cavewoman: Razor’s Run. A threat by the name of Malevolence, The Mother of Demons and she who rules over the realm of Limbo in the space between all worlds. Her power is growing and soon it will require every capable warrior across time, including our Cavewoman, to band together to stop her when the time comes. Is that time now?
Ever since that fateful meeting, Meriem has been haunted by nightmares of the horrors to come. Until one day, while on her morning hunt through the jungle, she comes across some demon minions of Malevolence intruding upon her lands thanks to a portal torn between her world and Limbo. With the threat now at her doorstep, she decides to take the fight to them and crosses over into Limbo, the realm beyond all. There she faces unspeakable evil, vile demon creatures, and human sacrifice! There will be blood, sweat, and of course, METAL! Join us for the Metal Age. It’ll be one hell of an adventure!

What we need & what you get!

Cavewoman: Metal Age was set to solicit through Diamond Distribution for a standard release to all comic stores this summer, but due to COVID-19 that was all shut down and we needed to look into alternative avenues to get the product out to fans. We ultimately decided that crowdfunding would be our best way to get the books out and we hope you will support us here!

Without the normal chain of distribution through Diamond Distribution and comic stores, we need to take it to the people directly to get the story out and also get us all paid. These books are done and ready to be printed and distributed. This is why we need your help.
These are being sold here similar to our other crowdfunding campaign, only with Indiegogo logos on back instead and all will also have titles on them as shown below. Rather than running the usual full print run for either campaign, we are doing smaller, closed editions with each. So these editions are exclusive to Indiegogo and will be individually serially numbered with the print run count in a closed edition just for here, but the covers are essentially the same on the front.

(check out the stretch goals further down!) After the campaign, we will go to print and deliver in October!
What YOU get:
The 7 incredible covers for Cavewoman: Metal Age #1 are done by some incredible indie comics talents including Andrew Mangum (covers A-C), Bill Maus (cover D), Budd Root (covers E & F), and Izik Bell (cover G)!!! We have them available in both full color covers or the even more limited b&w variants of each! We even have premium cover enhancements that are awesome looking and even more limited! All Premium Enhanced books are virgin covers! (scroll down further to see those)
As the main cover, Cover A will be the mass-market edition at $8 here and no print limit. Covers B-G variant covers are limited to 300 copies max (or less) and will be $15 each. The b&w variant covers are the same prices as their colored counterparts, but are limited to only 150 copies max (or less). A digital PDF edition of the comic is free with any pledge level as well!
We also are doing a $10 custom blank sketch cover that will not be sold in stores and is just for these campaigns with the Indiegogo logo printed on the bottom front corner. We also have a limited supply of the fully b&w Cavewoman: Metal Age #1 Fanexpo edition for $20. We printed 100 unnumbered copies of this special edition in advance for a convention we were supposed to do in March but was cancelled, so we are selling some of them in our campaigns. These have a pencil cover and b&w interiors instead of full color like the regular books. All covers are shown below.
**covers C & D are the topless variants so they are censored below but will not be censored when printed**

There is also a Premium SILVER Wraparound virgin cover edition that will form a large 4-cover image with the wraparound cover coming on Metal Age #2. It is only available in the Premium Silver and is not exclusive to either crowdfunding campaign, with no logos at all. 
This ONE cover will not be serially numbered because the other half of the image from issue #2's wraparound cover wouldn't match numbers anyway since they aren't being printed together.  These will be limited to 200 copies each, but they won't be serially numbered like everything else, similar to the Fanexpo edition.

Cover enhancement options available: 
We have some extremely nice cover enhancement options as well, only for our backers of the crowdfunding campaigns! So these WILL NOT be available in stores later, just like the sketch cover blank and the Fanexpo edition these are ONLY for these campaigns. The price on these is $50 each and we are limiting them to just 100 copies max of each or just limited to orders here, whichever is least. We did the same thing in the KS campaign and like those, the back covers will have the Indiegogo logo just for this campaign, and will be serially numbered with print count numbers on the front right bottom corner of each book.
We are offering enhancements in METAL, SILVER, GOLD, CHROME and CRYSTAL as cover enhancements! So below we have examples of SILVER on the extremely limited wraparound cover (the other half of the image will be a wraparound for issue 2), the Izik Bell cover G, and the Lords of Limbo 11x17 print. (the actual SILVER print will be 11x17 but the sample is smaller since it was just a sample)

Here are close up pics of each of the enhancements. ALL ENHANCED BOOKS WILL HAVE VIRGIN COVERS WITHOUT ANY TITLES. Shown here are CHROME, CRYSTAL, and SILVER for the wraparound cover. CHROME is like holofoil and rainbow in the light, CRYSTAL is very prismatic across the entire surface, and SILVER is very shiny like polished metallic chrome.





Shown below are SILVER, GOLD, and METAL enhancements. Silver is like polished metallic silver chrome, Gold is a very shiny metallic gold, and the Metal is an actual silver sheet of sheet metal with a polished color image printed right on it. (the titles on the SILVER & GOLD will not be on the real books, they were mistakenly put on the sample copies we printed below.)






ORIGINAL ART AVAILABLE!




ADD-ON PERKS:
We have several add-on perks available to add to your main perk during checkout, including the single cover art prints and the trading cards below that are only sold as add-ons.

TRADING CARDS:
We also have some custom trading cards made just for this campaign. First up is the 4-card Lords of Limbo trading card set for $10. The trading cards have character bios with some background info you wouldn't get otherwise!

The other set of trading cards we have are printed on actual metal! The ""Metal Age"" metal cards are printed full bleed to card size sheets of metal and feature ""Metal Age Meriem"" and ""Malevolence, The Ultimate Evil!"" This 2-card set is also $10 and only available here! (the Malevolence card is censored for here only and will not be censored on the actual card)

<h3>The Cast!</h3>
<p>'The Order of CelesSteel' are a team of characters based on the 12 signs of the Western Zodiac - see if you can guess who represents which? Originally mortal humans (with the exception of one...), each member was chosen by the benevolent Star Gods to receive their powers, and charged with the task of saving the last remnants of humanity in the dying fantasy world of Gaiamor, decimated in a war of hatred, greed and lust for power. </p>
<p>Along their journey through many adventures together, this team of mismatched heroes and heroines will have to learn to coexist and work together to battle back against the forces of evil. Heavily inspired by 80s cartoons, movies and fantasy, CelesSteel tells its story in strong, shameless 'straight from the heart' fashion. The characters all have their own individual back stories, and are designed and written to be immediately familiar and engaging. We want to take older readers right back to their childhoods when fiction truly had the power to touch you, and make you feel that same feeling of fascination and intrigue modern fantasy so often fails to engage.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is to make you laugh when your heroes become friends with one another and enjoy their gung-ho moments of camaraderie, smile as some may fall in love, and...in cruel (but meaningful) Transformers 86' fashion, some might not make it to the end...</p>
<p>Check back regularly throughout the campaign, when I'll be talking about each character individually and giving a little more background on each, and a few notes of the ideas behind their designs.</p>

<h3>The Pitch!</h3>
<p>To try and get more people interested in the comic, and on board to start financially supporting the whole CelesSteel project, and the ongoing creative efforts of myself and Retrolution Games. Whilst the comic and videogame are our primary pursuits, we intend to greatly expand and produce far more products, merchandise and projects as we continue to gain experience, grow and develop as a team, and the more people are willing to help out by pledging to and financing us, the more we'll be able to do.</p>
</div><div>
<p>The initial goal is to reach our target of $5000 to produce a new story once we're done wrapping up Part 3 of our current story Murder City Meltdown. As explained in the video, the new story will focus more of developing the characters and their relationships with each other and the world around them, initiating story arcs we can continue to build upon as the story evolves. This means that fans will have the chance to keep on financing us, giving feedback on how the story is developing and which characters and arcs they want to hear more from, and hopefully lead to the creation of a truly imaginative and satisfying canon.</p>
<p>As fan interaction is important to us, we'll also give regular opportunities for generous and enthusiastic backers to cameo in stories. The kind of adventures the CelesSteel team embark upon will naturally see them meeting many side characters such as villagers, refugees, prisoners, damsels and dudes in distress etc, and these would be perfect roles to be filled by fans.</p>
<p>Feedback on the two comics we've produced so far (available from our website <a href=""http://www.celessteel.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.celessteel.co.uk</a>, and Part 1 is FREE!) has been absolutely fantastic so far, with readers commenting on how well the characters and story emotionally engage with a strongly nostalgic feel as well as the striking quality of the colours and artwork, but we're facing an uphill battle to get it out there to a suitably large enough audience to render the project a success, which will require ongoing investment and effort in order to do so. The more fans are able to help us with this, the greater our chances of doing so - if you give us the support, helping us with donations and by spreading word, in return we'll do our best to keep providing you with the engaging, emotive and exciting fantasy you're looking for.</p>

</div></div>","The Cast!
'The Order of CelesSteel' are a team of characters based on the 12 signs of the Western Zodiac - see if you can guess who represents which? Originally mortal humans (with the exception of one...), each member was chosen by the benevolent Star Gods to receive their powers, and charged with the task of saving the last remnants of humanity in the dying fantasy world of Gaiamor, decimated in a war of hatred, greed and lust for power. 
Along their journey through many adventures together, this team of mismatched heroes and heroines will have to learn to coexist and work together to battle back against the forces of evil. Heavily inspired by 80s cartoons, movies and fantasy, CelesSteel tells its story in strong, shameless 'straight from the heart' fashion. The characters all have their own individual back stories, and are designed and written to be immediately familiar and engaging. We want to take older readers right back to their childhoods when fiction truly had the power to touch you, and make you feel that same feeling of fascination and intrigue modern fantasy so often fails to engage.
The ultimate goal is to make you laugh when your heroes become friends with one another and enjoy their gung-ho moments of camaraderie, smile as some may fall in love, and...in cruel (but meaningful) Transformers 86' fashion, some might not make it to the end...
Check back regularly throughout the campaign, when I'll be talking about each character individually and giving a little more background on each, and a few notes of the ideas behind their designs.

<p><i><strong>""If I don't get the lead role in the Hollywood remake, I'm going to be well p***ed off"" Danny John Jules (Red Dwarf, Blade 2 etc)</strong></i></p>
<p>The original <a href=""http://www.reynardcity.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Reynard City</a> was strongly influenced by 90s cartoons such as Thundercats, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and the Batman and X-Men animated series. On a basic level it's about three superhero foxes who come to Earth and stop an evil robot fox. However, the story takes a few strange and surreal turns and it soon becomes clear that there is more to it then what you might expect.</p>
<p><strong><i>Characters</i></strong></p>
<p><i><strong>“You had me at superhero foxes” Shaney​ (Webhero Network)</strong></i></p>
<p><b><i>Vibes/AK Girl: When we first meet Vibes, she seems like an ordinary person who works as a DJ at a radio station. But she is also troubled by strange visions and soon she finds out she is actually AK Girl, a psychic superhero vixen with an unusual weakness.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Guillermo/Hyper Rob: The son of a notorious gangster, Guillermo is driven by the need to fight injustice as well as find his lost love Sal. But Vibes is scared that Sal may not be the woman he remembers...</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Sal/Wondervixen: Guillermo is determined to track down his lost love. But some troubling visions from Vibes suggest that this former child talent show star is not all she appears to be...</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Mega Fox: The fearsome robot fox, brought into the world to create order, who instead decided to impose his own.</i></b></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our goal for the £500 breaks down into two main parts-</p>
<p>1. £300 This is the amount we need to get 100 printed copies of the comic.</p>
<p>2. £200 This will cover the cost of merchandise that we want to order in to fund other costs, using established local brands like <a href=""http://greenfarmcoffee.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Green Farm Coffee </a>and <a href=""https://www.saffire.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Saffire Chocolates</a>, as well as <a href=""https://www.badgebase.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Badge Base</a> who have been very supportive.</p>
<p>If we don't meet these targets, then however much we make will go toward these costs, and will mean there is more money for the artists and creative talent that have worked hard. On the other hand if we get more than our target then the additional money will be given to the team and put aside in a fund for commissions to support other artists (depending on how much additional funds above £500 are raised). You can find out more about our team on our page <a href=""http://www.reynardcity.com/the-comics/meet-the-team/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here.</a></p>
<p>With regard to merchandise, this is a good time to talk about the perks. Our perks will range from an online copy of Reynard City Chronicles #1, all the way to a special Fox Box complete with merchandise, exclusive gifts, artwork AND a personalised message from AK Girl herself (voiced by the very talented Hayley Evenett, check out her vlog she performed/edited below!)</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have been fortunate to get support before. We have some fantastic <a href=""http://www.patreon.com/reynardcity"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Patreon</a> backers, sponsors (including <a href=""https://visualisecreative.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Visualise Web Design</a>, <a href=""http://www.norwichkitty.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Norwich Kitty</a>, <a href=""http://couzens-lake.co.uk/v3/home"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Edward Couzens-Lake</a> and <a href=""http://dalmaine.biz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">D'Almaine Photography</a>).</p>
<p>However, in order to get Reynard City on a high enough level and to be able to give the artists the support they deserve, we need your support. Being able to cover the costs of printing and merchandise will mean when we sell those items we will be able to support getting out to more conventions, support the artists more and get commissions for artists who deserve additional exposure.</p>
<p>My eventual dream would be to produce a Reynard City animated series, but I am aware that is very much a long term goal and that first of all I want to make a comic series anyone can enjoy, whether you are a hardcore comics fan or someone like me who discovered them after watching Saturday morning TV cartoons.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It is understandable- delays happen with comics, even at the highest level. At present, Reynard City Chronicles is about 12 pages away from completion. Our aim is to produce one 40 page graphic novel every year. We already have an excellent artist (Joel Draco Petterson) lined up for Reynard City Chronicles #2, and there are plans in place for a full series, with a narrative that goes from beginning to end.</p>
<p>In effect this campaign is building on ten years of work that went into the original series, listening to feedback from both loyal fans and casual readers alike in order to make something that everyone can enjoy.</p>

<p>Hello, comics lovers, supporters, and friends. John G. here, writer and creator of The Grim Reaper, bringing you the sequel to our first successful campaign: The Grim Reaper 2.</p>
<p>In this cosmic horror adventure, we will continue the story of the Grim Reaper as he travels to hell, trying to find out who is killing the immortals, and most importantly, with what!</p>
<p>Along the way, he will be faced with many more challenges and foes that will change him forever and put his strength and power to the test. The Grim Reaper has many forms, we have seen him as the mysterious man with the hat, or the cloaked angel of death. This time he is in battle mode, as he unleashes his dark powers, and lets the rage within him consume him.</p>
<p>For this iteration of our beloved character, we have developed crazy new adventures, great supporting characters, tons of action, and lots of great art by the hand of the very talented artist Carla Tornielli. For this campaign, we have decided to try bold things that would surely rock your world, and explore exciting new concepts in this passion project that means so much to both me and Carla, and which has brought us so much joy! I am confident to say that this is our best work yet, and we want you to be a part of it!</p>

<p>Help us fund this exciting project, and explore all of the cool rewards that we have for you!</p>
<p> If you help us get funded you can choose to get the Grim Reaper 2, but also an amazing spin-off story involving The Grim Reaper and the mad monk of Siberia, the well-known necromancer and wizard, Rasputin.</p>
<p>""The Curse of the Medallion"" is the title of the Spin-Off book we offer along Issue 2.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Also, if you missed out on the first issue of The Grim Reaper, you can also get a copy with a variant cover!  How cool is that?! </p>
<p>In addition to this amazing content, we'll also have some merch available, such as sketches, pin-ups, draw-ins, and a mystery box which will contain secret merch and books.</p>

<p>Myself and Carla could not thank you enough for all of the support, and the great feedback you had given us.

<p>Here are some pages from the interior art, which is still in progress. This isn't the final product yet.  Most of the comic pages are mostly complete like the following ones, so the wait will not be long.

 If you help us get funded you can choose to get the Grim Reaper 2, but also an amazing spin-off story involving The Grim Reaper and the mad monk of Siberia, the well-known necromancer and wizard, Rasputin.
""The Curse of the Medallion"" is the title of the Spin-Off book we offer along Issue 2.

 
Also, if you missed out on the first issue of The Grim Reaper, you can also get a copy with a variant cover!  How cool is that?! 
In addition to this amazing content, we'll also have some merch available, such as sketches, pin-ups, draw-ins, and a mystery box which will contain secret merch and books.

 


 

 

 
(A little Work In progress of one of the Pin-Ups we offer).
 



 

If you loved the first issue, you are surely going to love this one even more!
Myself and Carla could not thank you enough for all of the support, and the great feedback you had given us. So, to all of the fans of The Grim Reaper out there, I am here to tell you that this one is for you.  This second issue has everything that made the first issue great, while bringing new things to the table that we know you'll love too!
 
And to all of you who are new to this, and have never heard of this project, let me welcome you to the Grim Reaper family, and assure you that you'll not regret backing this book(s).
 


 

We pride ourselves in early delivery, hard work and taking care of all of our supporters. 
If you are a returning backer, you know this to be the case, but if you are new let me tell you right now that there are no risks with this project. The project is almost complete, and we will go out of our way to get it to you before the deadline, just like last time!  It doesn't matter if you are in the U.S. or overseas, if you backed this project, you will get your rewards on time.
This picture is from our last campaign fulfillment.  (The shipping date was set for May 2020, and it was successfully fulfilled in November 2019, just a month after the campaign ended. )
 

Here are some pages from the interior art, which is still in progress. This isn't the final product yet.  Most of the comic pages are mostly complete like the following ones, so the wait will not be long. The talented artist Carla Tornielli is responsible for the amazing art, inks, and colors, giving this project's covers, pin-ups and pages the same high quality.

À propos de l'autrice
About the Author




Mon nom est Jessi, alias Anouk, et je suis l'autrice derrière le webcomic médiéval fantastique L'armée du Soleil.
J'ai auto-publié divers fanzines queer dont Sofa (2017), Le soir où Kovalev a fait un tour du chapeau (2018), Tout va bien (2018) et Nuit blanche (2018).
La normalisation de la diversité et de la queeridentité est au coeur de mon travail et ma raison de faire de la bande dessinée.
En avril 2018, L'armée du Soleil s'est mérité le prix Jacques-Hurtubise remis lors du Festival Québec BD pour encourager l'auto-édition.


My name is Jessi, a.k.a Anouk, and I am the author and artist behind the medieval fantasy webcomic Sun's Blade.
I self published queer zines such as Sofa (2017), Everything's Fine (2018) and White Knight (2018).
Normalising diversity and queer identity is at the core of my creative work and the reason why I'm making comics in the first place.
In April 2018, Sun's Blade received the Jacques-Hurtubise award.



À propos deL'armée du Soleil
AboutSun's Blade



Inspirées d'une campagne de jeux de rôle inachevée jouée durant 1 an avec un groupe d'amis, les premières planches de L'armée du Soleil ont vues le jour sous forme d'un pilote de 15 pages en mai 2016. Ces pages ont été révélées au public 6 mois plus tard en prévision d'un lancement officiel du webcomic retravaillé.
Inspired by an unfinished role playing campaign played over a year with a group of friends, the first panels of Sun's Blade were born as a 15 pages pilot in May 2016. Those pages were revealed to the public eye 6 months later as the official webcomic was reworked and launched.


Vous pouvez lire les 3 premiers chapitres de L'armée du Soleil en ligne:
You can read the first 3 chapters of Sun's Blade online:








Depuis le 8 mars 2017, L'armée du Soleil est mis en ligne toutes les deux semaines.
À ce jour, le webcomic contient 3 chapitres totalisant 92 pages.


Since March 8 2017, Sun's Blade is updated online every two weeks.
To this day, the webcomic contains 3 chapters for a total of 92 pages.



Le livre
The Book
 
Les chapitres 1, 2 et un bonus exclusif seront compilés dans un 1er livre physique et auto-publié à paraître pour le Festival de bande dessinée de Montréal (FBDM) le 24 mai prochain.
Chapters 1, 2 and an exclusive bonus will be compiled into a 1st self-published physical book set to be released for Montreal's comic arts festival (MCAF) on May 24.




Avoir des copies de L'armée du Soleil à ma table de convention va rendre le projet concret aux yeux des visiteurs et lui donner la crédibilité qu'il mérite. Je suis très fière de l'avoir amené jusqu'ici et votre contribution l'aidera grandement à grandir.
L'impression d'une bande dessinée couleur est assez dispendieuse. Le but de cette campagne est d'aider à financer l'impression de ""L'armée du Soleil, livre 1"" pour la saison des conventions. 


Having copies of Sun's Blade to sell at my convention table will give credibility, visibility and the recognition this project needs and deserves. I'm very proud of it and your contribution will greatly help a small project grow.
Printing a colour comic is quite expensive. The goal of this campaign is first to help ""Sun's Blade, book 1"" be printed for the upcoming convention season.


Synopsis 

Suite au naufrage du navire sur lequel y voyageaient, Anaïs, Wilhem et Fritz sont pris sur une île inconnue et enneigée. Le groupe parcourt le territoire à la recherche de quelqu'un ou quelque chose qui pourra les aider à les guider vers la maison.
Chapitre bonus: Wilhem avant la tempête...


After the ship on which they were travelling crashed, Anaïs, Wilhem and Fritz are stuck on an unknown snowy island. They then journey on the lands in hope of finding anyone or anything that can help them find their way back home.​
Bonus chapter: Will before the storm...

Risques et défis
Risks & Challenges



Les délais sont très serrés et les risques de prendre du retard sont relativement grands.
C'est pourquoi mon temps et mon énergie seront consacrés prioritairement à la finition des livres. Dans le pire des cas, les contreparties viendront plus tard.
Objectif atteint ou non, tous les fonds amassés vont servir à l'impression des livres et des contreparties.


The deadlines are very tight and there are risks of being late.
That's why my time and energy will be first spent on finishing the books. Worst case scenario, the merch will come later.
No matter what, every dollar collected will be used to print the books and its merch.

and have ordered Pokey books.   Pokey fans on twitter have said many things about Pokey, including:        It may surprise you to know that Pokey has
 influenced art figures such as Corey Archangel and M.K. Hobson, writer 
of historical fantasy.      If Pokey has ever made you laugh, please, give to THE AUTHORS to help them keep writing.
  Steve has never sought personal fame or promoted this comic, it is all done through fans like you. 
       You are what makes Pokey go.
 
 When we read your words on Twitter or Tumblr, or read your 
emails, it makes us all so happy. Thank you for your words of support.  
 Today, Steve and I are asking if you would do something 
more than offer words. Would you please donate to keep Pokey going?   When you donate, you are making Pokey live on. Please, consider a donation today. Even a penny will help. Matt says:   Donations to Pokey the Penguin are not tax-deductible, but are going to make more Pokeys.    If we raise $2,000 by December 3rd, THE AUTHORS will make 10 more Pokeys by the end of the year.     If we raise $5,000 by December 3rd, THE AUTHORS will make 20 more Pokeys by December 31st. ""Your support means so much to me. Pokey loves to read your email, and so do I."" -Steve
  Thank you for supporting Pokey. Without fans like you, Pokey the Penguin would not be possible.     Please, give today, and let's make more Pokey adventures happen!     Friends of Pokey & THE AUTHORS   P.S. If Pokey has ever made you laugh, please consider donating to keep Pokey the Penguin going.  If we raise $2,000 by December 3rd, THE AUTHORS will write 10 more Pokeys! Let's do it!
  What We Need & What You Get Your donation may have features such as:

A customized Pokey gif
Thank you note from Pokey,
Or a 10 book set!

    If we raise $2,000 by December 3rd, THE AUTHORS will make 10 more Pokeys by the end of the year. If we raise $5,000 by December 3rd, THE AUTHORS will make 20 more Pokeys by December 31st.
 
 
Risks & Challenges     Friends of Pokey and Steve Havelka have never launched a campaign for Pokey before. This is a challenge.      We hope to overcome it by having a professional fundraiser and friend of Pokey, Mazarine Treyz, of Wild Woman Fundraising, come in and help us achieve our goal.      We are counting on Pokey fans to help us achieve our goals of more Pokey comics!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hallowscream is a global horror comic that brings artists and writers together from around the world.

<p><br/></p>
<p>In March of this year we announced details of Hallowscream 2011 on various platforms around the internet. From that announcement we received loads of stories from eager horror writers all looking to see their work appear in an online comic. Some of these terrifying tales were already in script format while others arrived as spooky short stories or even petrifying poems. We were then able to match these stories to comic artists who had answered our call and wanted to be a part of Hallowscream.  We also received a few completed horror strips from existing comic creators which had yet to be published. This year's issue features the work of contributors from America, Australia, UK (where it all began) and the rest of Europe!</p>

“THE F1RST HERO” is a unique new take on the superhero mythos, written by ANTHONY RUTTGAIZER and illustrated by PHILLIP SEVY with colors/letters by KT SMITH (American Splendor, Northern Guard) and covers by LEE MODER (Shinku, Wonder Woman, Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E.).  The first story arc is four issues long and debuts around March 2014 from ACTION LAB COMICS (Molly Danger, Princeless, NFL Rush Zone).

""A really, really good high concept. It instantly offers a reader a character who we know will face tons of nasty challenges and a character who is unique in the world - always a good start.""- Ty Templeton: Writer, Batman Adventures
""I like the implicit sense of humour. I like the idea that [superhumans] are shunned. I like the dilemma.""- Mark Askwith: Senior Producer, Space Television
""Anthony Ruttgaizer has created a 'Mutant Registration Act' that actually makes sense.""- George Zotti: Co-Owner, Silver Snail Comic Shops
""The premise sounds very interesting. I'm inclined to think it'll be a hit.""- Richard Pace: Penciller, New Warriors/Starman
""I thought [the preview] was great.""- Tony S. Daniel: Writer/Artist, Detective Comics/Action Comics
""[Sevy] is ready to go!""- Francis Manapul: Writer/Artist, Flash
 






We are hoping to raise at least $7500 so that we can cover our production costs for the series and so we can distribute some publicity material about the series to retailers.  And, of course, a chunk of the money (upwards of 50%) will go towards fulfilling the rewards themselves and covering the IndieGoGo/PayPal fees. 

But the more money we raise, the more we can get done.  If we exceed our goal, the additional money raised will go towards covering some of our start-up legal costs, having some banners made for conventions and getting a head-start on our second story arc/mini-series.

First and foremost, each and every reward package includes the complete four issue series in digital and/or print format.  So you don't have to worry about finding a local comic shop that is carrying the book or whether or not they will sell out of the book before you get there.  Make any level of pledge to help the book get produced and you will get a copy.
The rewards are pretty simple but really fun.  You can get the entire four issue series delivered to you digitally, readable on any home computer, smart phone or tablet, as a PDF for only $5.  If you prefer to read story arcs all at once, we have packages that include the TRADE PAPERBACK starting at $25.  And for all you purists, we can send you ALL FOUR ISSUES IN TRADITIONAL PRINT FORMAT for as little $35.  And you can add the PDF edition of the book to any other package by just adding $5 to your pledge.
We've also tried come up with a few higher tier rewards to spark your interest.  T-SHIRTS, ORIGINAL PAGES OF ART from the series or even brand-new CONVENTION SKETCHBOOKS each featuring a one-of-a-kind original drawing (one character of your choosing) by such amazing artists as FRANCIS MANAPUL (The Flash, Witchblade), MARCUS TO (Batwing, Flash, Red Robin, Cyborg 009), and our own LEE MODER and PHILLIP SEVY.

Or maybe you'd like to see YOUR FACE in the pages of ""THE F1RST HERO"".  For $125, we have a package that includes a CAMEO APPEARANCE.  For $250, you can buy yourself a SPEAKING PART in the book!  For the big ticket price of $1000, you can become a MAJOR RECURRING CHARACTER in The F1rst Hero.  Your character will be part of storylines for years to come.  Plus, we'll throw in a ton of original art, copies of the comic and other swag.



























Please use the share tools near the top of this page and help spread the word about ""THE F1RST HERO"" via Twitter, Facebook, e-mail, carrier pigeon, smoke signal, jungle drum, interpretive dance or whatever else is available to you.  Even if you can't contribute, you can help make this project successful by telling your friends and neighbours about it.  
The success of this book will be told by how many people buy it, read it and enjoy it.  And if Volume 1 is successful, we'll bring you Volume 2 and 3 and 4 and a whole lot more as we tell the story of ""THE F1RST HERO"".",31.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Story in a Nutshell</h3>
<p>Written and illustrated as a quirky tribute to two special people I lost to cancer, CHICKENHEAD is the story of an imaginative boy named Ed. He loses his hair and uses the head of his brother's chicken costume to hide the baldness. He even wears it to school! He is frustrated and keeps to himself until mute little Tablet climbs through his bedroom window. Tablet at first annoys Ed with her scribbly little notepad and her girliness, but ultimately, Tablet manages to silently pull Ed out from under the chicken head and back into play.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>CHICKENHEAD needs to be published and spread, but I can't do it on my own! Your contributions are essential!</p>
<p>The goal of $1400 will pay for:</p>
<p>1. hardcover copies to go to the families of the two people for whom CHICKENHEAD was written.</p>
<p>2. paperback dummies to be sent to prospective publishers and literary agents</p>
<p>3. a limited number of smaller paperback versions to be sold to collectors and art/book events</p>
<p>4. and of course, perks for the contributors!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If I don't reach my goal?</strong></p>
<p>Any amount contributed will still be deeply appreciated and used as efficiently as possible. The hardcover copies for the families and producing the contributors perks are my highest priorities!</p>

<p><strong>Michael T. Gilbert</strong>’s <strong><i>Wraith</i></strong> series was a 1970s cult classic, and a training ground for Gilbert’s later work on <strong><i>Elric</i></strong> and <i><strong>Mr. Monster</strong></i>. Conceived as a funny-animal version of Will Eisner’s <i>Spirit</i>, The <i>Wraith</i>’s fans include Eisner himself, who wrote: </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">“The Wraith has a lot of originality. <br/>Your style and approach are very vigorous!”</h3>
<p>Appearing in all six issues of Star*Reach’s <i>Quack!</i>, as well as Michael T. Gilbert’s <i>Strange Brew</i>, this volume collects every <i>Wraith</i> story, scanned from the original art for the first time. </p>
<p>It also features unpublished drawings and photos, plus an intro by <strong>Mr. Monster</strong> himself! </p>
<p>Michael T. Gilbert’s commentary on each story provides a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at the 1970s comic book scene.</p>

</div></div>","Michael T. Gilbert’s Wraith series was a 1970s cult classic, and a training ground for Gilbert’s later work on Elric and Mr. Monster. Conceived as a funny-animal version of Will Eisner’s Spirit, The Wraith’s fans include Eisner himself, who wrote: 
“The Wraith has a lot of originality. Your style and approach are very vigorous!”
Appearing in all six issues of Star*Reach’s Quack!, as well as Michael T. Gilbert’s Strange Brew, this volume collects every Wraith story, scanned from the original art for the first time. 
It also features unpublished drawings and photos, plus an intro by Mr. Monster himself! 
Michael T. Gilbert’s commentary on each story provides a fascinating behind-the-scenes look at the 1970s comic book scene.

<p> Frankly, it's an
awesome platform for like minded people who love and support art. I believe in
""throwing your hat over the wall."" What does that mean? It means you
believe in what you are doing SO MUCH that you are willing to take a giant leap

discussing with Eric, we felt THIS is the place for our vision and goal. </p>
<p>That being said...</p>
<p>THE BOOK IS ALREADY DONE!!!</p>
<p>Eric and I, after many sleepless nights and late phone call
and email sessions, wrapped the book and have already formatted for print and
publishing. </p>
<p><b>If the book is
already done, why do you need our help?</b></p>
<p>With the book being done, we have invested <b><u>A LOT</u></b> of man
hours into it. We love what we do, the hours are truly a labor of love from the
rewrites, edits, pencils, inks, colors, letters, formatting and so on... if all
that translated into dollars the book would have millions of copies in
circulation... however... it does not translate.</p>
<p>We have set a goal of $2,000, but in all honesty, anything
will help. As I said before, I believe in ""Throwing your hat over the

However, after some research, this corresponds to an ancient Hebrew story of Jonah traveling to the underworld. You can read more about this Hebrew rabbinic tradition here.</p><p>While not directly related, Tolkien had a similar passage in The Lord of the Rings. When Gollum sees the Misty Mountains for the first time he says, “It would be cool and shady under those mountains.

This is our BIGGEST PROJECT YET!! Take a look at what to expect in our new single-issue 40 page comic book (including 6-8 pages of extra material!)Not all who wander are lost...The ancient city of Nineveh is under the spell of a malevolent demon who thirsts for souls. In an effort to break free the people of Nineveh from the evil darkness that enslaves them, God sends the prophet Jonah to deliver a message of warning.However, Jonah turns timid and flees in the opposite direction, away from his divine quest. A violent storm at sea puts Jonah at the mercy of a mammoth creature that takes him down into the watery depths. Down in the coldest, quietest waters, in the forgotten elder city of Atlantis, Jonah learns how black the shadow is that falls over Nineveh, and is given a legendary weapon in hopes that he can save the city before it is too late.Sample Pages ""I have what some might call an Atlantis complex....This legend or myth or dim memory of some ancient history has always troubled me. In sleep I had the dreadful dream of the ineluctable Wave, either coming out of the quiet sea, or coming in towering over the green inlands. It still occurs occasionally, though now exorcized by writing about it. It always ends by surrender, and I awake gasping out of deep water. I used to draw it or write bad poems about it."" ― J.R.R. TolkienWith this project, we are inspired by the Book of Jonah, as translated by J.R.R. Tolkien (in the Jerusalem Bible). Jonah prays in the belly of the whale and the words used by Tolkien are very interesting and reveal a fascinating Hebrew tradition.The waters surrounded me right to my throat, the abyss was all around me. The seaweed was wrapped around my head at the roots of the mountains. I went down into the countries underneath the earth, to the peoples of the past. (Jonah 2:6-7)All other translations omit this verse or translate it differently. However, after some research, this corresponds to an ancient Hebrew story of Jonah traveling to the underworld. You can read more about this Hebrew rabbinic tradition here.While not directly related, Tolkien had a similar passage in The Lord of the Rings. When Gollum sees the Misty Mountains for the first time he says, “It would be cool and shady under those mountains. The Sun could not watch me there. The roots of those mountains must be roots indeed; there must be great secrets buried there which have not been discovered since the beginning.”What’s even more fascinating is where Jonah was planning on traveling to, “Jonah rose to flee to Tarshish from the presence of the Lord” (Jonah 1:3). Recently some historians have linked this biblical city with the legendary city of Atlantis. You can read more about this fascinating connection here.Putting it all together, we are exploring these connections and creating a comic book centered on Jonah, as he travels to the legendary city of Atlantis after being thrown overboard. It is a mix of biblical history, fantasy and mythology, all merged together to tell a story of mercy, forgiveness and the light that shines in the darkness. Spiritual warfare is also a key plot of this re-telling of the Jonah story, highlighting the spiritual forces active in this world.CREATOR/WRITER - Philip Kosloski is a writer well known for his accessible articles on topics of spirituality and Church history at Aleteia.org as well as his comic book series Finnian and the Seven Mountains and The Mission of Joan of Arc.CONSULTING EDITOR - Lewis Helfand is freelance comic book writer and editor.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p></p>
<p>The comic industry finds is at an impasse.  It's as if it is a constant state of flux, and like anything in a period of transition, some of the most important elements are often lost in the shuffle as it adjusts and adapts to changing times.  There's no doubt that industry is kept alive by the sales of large publishers, but we must never forget that the industry thrives by the sale of its independent publishers.  It was the independent publishers who helped comics evolve past capes and cowls, it was the independent publishers who turned comics from children's reading material into one of the highest forms of art.  And ultimately it will always be the independent publishers that help feed and grow the larger publishers, providing them with the next generation of writers and artists.  Yet now, amidst all the changes, it's the independent publishers who are struggling to maintain their place in the industry.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Liber hopes to change that.  With a focus solely on quality small press, independent, and self-published comics, Liber offers publishers the things they they won't find with other distributors.  Liber offers creators a chance to grow, a chance to find their voice, and more importantly, find those who will listen.  Liber's distribution services are free to publishers and creators, and we also offer several low cost marketing and printing services designed to help connect you with those anxious to carry your work.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a distributor we want our publishers to feel like their titles are safe so they can focus on what's important - making the best comics possible.  Publishers will never have to worry about a title being dropped or reorders not being taken due to low sales numbers.  We'll carry your titles as long as you're willing to print them.  And to help get your books into stores we strive to offer retailers the highest discounts possible, along with an easy to use and intuitive ordering system to make any book Liber offers just a click away.  </p>

<p>“In 2008, I directed a well-received production of Ginger Mayerson’s bloodily biting political satire, Darkness at Sunset and Vine.  This work embodies what I like best about Mayerson’s work – muscular, lightening-paced plotting that has the brains to match its brawn, and quirky characters that despite being drawn in shades of soul-scorching neon and unflinching black, still retain their power to engage the reader’s empathy.  Mayerson’s novels are a swift left hook to the right frontal lobe -- wicked, witty, and wonderful.”<br/>Kelly S.

Eschaton-a-Go-Go.  In a parallel universe, Dr. Ravana drags her sister, General Kumbhakarna, into a war on the Gods.  They lose, and are sentenced to a period of exile and penance in our universe.  They meet up with Lake Baikal lake spirits on a spree and help out evolving humanity as best they can.  This ranges from fighting off monsters from another universe to fixing the internet to witnessing the All Girl Rapture and how this affects the future of mankind.

Kumbhakarna in our universe
Eschaton-a-Go-Go IndieGoGo Campaign. Molly Kiely and Ginger Mayerson really need you, your help, and well, your money to raise $12,999 to create the art and publish “Eschaton-a-GoGo,” a rollicking tale of two or more universes, demigoddesses, lake spirits, librarians, comic book fanboys, and how the All Girl Rapture affects the future of mankind.  And the cheesecake, beefcake, panoramic landscapes, cityscapes, surreality, romance, humor, horror, action and emotion as only Molly Kiely can draw.


Ravana and a woolly mammoth
The script was finished in 2009 (Sample), but due to massive time constraints (ie: motherhood) on Molly, only a few sketches and drawings were created.  Fast forward to 2013, and the only thing stopping us from finishing the artwork for a 70- 80 page graphic novel and publishing it is money.All Girl Rapture Yes, money.  We need money for Molly Kiely to have the time and supplies to draw/ink/letter/and in some cases paint 70-80 pages of this epic, and epically wacky epic, fun-filled, sexy, action-packed, and thought provoking graphic novel.Ginger Mayerson needs money to put it together as a book and publish it.  Yes, Molly is going to have more fun than Ginger, but that’s okay because this book is very much worth it.  And Ginger has an excellent track record for publishing books at the Wapshott Press.The War in HeavenOur Perks are the perkiest and only available as fundraisers for this project.  Ever.  These wonderful perks will never ever be available in any other way except as a fundraiser for “Eschaton-a-Go-Go.  So get ‘em while you can.  

One of our very fine perks:  the Postcard Perk for $20 or more (more for postage if outside of the U.S. And, no, sorry, you don't get all of these postcards. You get 2 each of these, so 12 postcards cards in the set)
Also check our blog/website  for updates, social media, and all the news that fit to post to a wordpress.com blog.  If you'd like to help us get the word out about the campaign, there are web banners and graphics you can hotlink to on our website.
As for Ginger and Molly.  Well, the eyes have it.




Please feel free to contact either of us through the blog/website if you have any questions about this project or whatever, such as how you can contribute outside of IndieGoGo. (Yes, honey, we're looking at you!)  Thanks.
Ringing endorsements:“A graphic novel written by the fabulous Ginger Mayeron (of Hackenbush fame) and the amazing Molly Kiely (Diary of a Dominatrix, Tecopa Jane)? And it takes place in a parallel universe? And there are magical elk headdresses? So there IS something to look forward to! I support this project with all my heart, and you should too. It's gonna be awesome.”Lene Taylor, Comics Reading Diva, 'I Read Comics' and 'Look at his Butt' podcasts
""News of new comic art from Molly Kiely is not only long overdue, but also very welcomed. I can't wait to read it.""Eric Reynolds, Associate Publisher and Very Cool Guy at Fantagraphics Books, Seattle, Washington
“In 2008, I directed a well-received production of Ginger Mayerson’s bloodily biting political satire, Darkness at Sunset and Vine.  This work embodies what I like best about Mayerson’s work – muscular, lightening-paced plotting that has the brains to match its brawn, and quirky characters that despite being drawn in shades of soul-scorching neon and unflinching black, still retain their power to engage the reader’s empathy.  Mayerson’s novels are a swift left hook to the right frontal lobe -- wicked, witty, and wonderful.”Kelly S. Taylor, Ph.D., Associate Professor in Communication Studies and Storytelling Prima Donna at North Texas State University, Denton, Texas (no relation to Ms. Taylor, or Liz Taylor, Zachary Taylor, or Taylor Swift for that matter)

<p>Hi! My name is Kayla Davis!</p>
<p>I have been running an autobiographical webcomic about my married life online since 2009. I open the doors and let everything just spill out. You get to see what it's like to be the new age odd couple living in the bible belt of the south. Somethings are funny, somethings are sad, something are just weird. Like my obsession with murder mysteries, my husband's love of all things Mecha, and my current quest to get a mini horse!  Feel free to check it out <a href=""http://casuallykayla.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here </a><a href=""http://casuallykayla.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Casually kayla""><br/></a></p>
<p>With this project, I am trying to get at least150-300 cold cast resin figures made.   The figures will stand 3.8"" and are fully pre painted.  The first figure to be made is Casually Kayla herself and if I get enough interested, Daniel will be printed at a later date.  </p>
<p>I am trying to get 2 figues made, right now,  regular clothing Casually Kayla and then a limited edition Kimono Kayla.  </p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://casuallykayla.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/IMG_0344.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/> <img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://casuallykayla.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/P1050945.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://casuallykayla.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/P1060076.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So here is what we need.  $800.00, which is half of the funds needed to get the figures made.  I will supply the other half with my own funds.   This campaign is for the figures only,  so I will only being showing perks that are concerning the figures.  </p>
<p>15.00 will get you a regular clothing Kayla.  This includes shipping.  Or if you would like to get the kimono Kayla, that will run you about 19.00.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Why Donate?: </h2>
<p>So you can say you're one of the first, of course!  Also, this is essentially a pre order and with that, everyone who donates is getting items at a very deep discounted rate.  Once the pre orders are over, all items go up for their regular retail price. </p>
<h2><strong>What happens if we meet our Goal?:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>That would be so awesome! All items will then be shipped out no later than October 2013.    The samples have already been made all it will take 30 days to make the initial run.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What are Stretch Goals?:</h2>
<p>Stretch Goals are like achievements in a video game.  They will unlock once we reach and exceed our target goal. The secret goals will effect all orders with special gifts.  Everyone knows that I like to include tons of freebies in my orders, so just imagine getting freebies and more presents for exceeding our goal!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>What happens if we don't meet our Goal?:</strong></h2>
<p>I will be one sad Kayla, but I will understand.</p>
<p>This will mean that the production of the figures will be delayed.  Everyone who donated will get their items but it will be a little later. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Can't donate?:</strong></h2>
<p><strong>That's okay! Word of mouth is just as good. So tell everyone you know about Casually Kayla and the book and tell them how much you love it! Link your friends to the campaign or directly to the comic.  </strong></p>

<h3>What is Scurry?  </h3>
<p>Scurry is the story of a colony of mice in an abandoned house who are struggling to survive a long, strange winter. The humans are all gone and the sun is rarely seen. As food becomes scarce and many mice fall ill, the scavengers are forced to search farther from their home, braving monster infested lands in search of anything that will help the colony survive another day. Being hunted by feral cats and predatory birds is part of life for these mice, but beyond the fences stalks something far more fearsome...  </p>
<h3>The Books.</h3>
<p>All 3 books are available during this campaign, in oversized paperback or hardcover format, as well as digital PDF format. In total the books are over 320 pages, with lots of concept art, character biographies, step-by-step process pics, and more!</p>
<p>There is also a hardcover set that includes a full series, foil-stamped, premium slipcover that will look great on the shelf.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1569912568/mnmj16gcduvjsikklkf8.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Where We Are &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Books 1 and 2 are finished, and the 3rd book is mostly finished. The story for book 3 is complete and the artwork is about 85% done and I expect to have the final pages done soon. After some final preparations for printing and once the proofs are approved, the printing will be ready to go. I'm hoping to get them delivered around April or May if everything goes smoothly.</p>
<p>Complexity can be a campaign killer, so I'm keeping this crowdfunding campaign really simple so I can get it shipped out as smoothly as possible.  For this one there won't be extras or variant covers, and the stretch goals to improve quality have all been met already, so they are already included. Their are ""perks"" for digital, paperback, hardcover, hardcover plus slipcover, and a few sketch perks. There are also a few bulk order perks.</p>
<h3>Who Are We?</h3>
<p>Scurry has been the passion project of Mac Smith, nearly 5 years in the making. Mac is an artist, illustrator and writer based in Portland, Oregon (but has lived all over the country). He worked in the entertainment industry for over ten years primarily as a concept artist for videogames, but got tired of the studio grind, so he left Southern California and moved to a tiny apartment in the Pacific Northwest to set up shop as an independent artist. It hasn't always been easy (He makes far less money and has zero free time, etc.) but so far it's been one of the best decisions he's ever made. He loves creating art again. Hopefully, with your help, he can continue. </p>
<p>Doug is a dog. A very hairy, very mysterious dog. Mac doesn't know what kind he is, but everyone asks. If Doug knows, he isn't telling anyone. Doug is super secretive about his past.</p>

<p>I try to keep reward tiers as simple and limited to insure that things go as smoothly as possible, but if you have any questions, feel free to message me here on indiegogo or by email at mac@scurrycomic.com.</p>
<p>U.S. shipping for most tiers = $7 USD</p>
<p>International shipping is unfortunately very expensive, but I have worked to reduce the cost as much as possible. International shipping = $20 USD in Canada and EU, $25 USD everywhere else. (Important note for international backers: I have offered EU and Canada friendly shipping in the past, but due to possible changes to trade laws, I can't promise it for this one. I still intend to avoid passing on customs fees, VAT taxes and tariffs for as many backers as I can, but it's possible that they may be unavoidable. You may be responsible for these fees.)</p>
<p>- All paperbacks are currently sold out. </p>
<p>- I went ahead and added an international shipping option for the sketch tier, but unfortunately it's very expensive for me to ship those overseas. Those are $40 to ship.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I successfully fulfilled two crowdfunding campaigns for the first two books, and backers were very happy with them. So I have some experience.</p>
<p>Every possible precaution has been taken to ensure that the printing and shipping go smoothly, but it's possible that printing or shipping issues could arise and the book could be delayed. In such an unlikely case, backers will be notified and given updates on the reasons for the delay. I intend to update monthly regardless.</p>
<p>I understand the faith that backers have in me and my project so I'll be very transparent with everything that goes into the production of this book by posting frequent and timely updates, and being quick to notify backers of any setbacks.</p>

Orb is a comic book series about a diverse group of LGBT individuals who must band together in order to usher in the next phase of evolution. Only Eli and Mira are aware of the purpose for which their special abilities are intended, and it is up to them to unite and train the others with powers for the impending challenge.
  
The Impact
 
My name is Tom S. Johnson, and I co-created Orb and co-wrote its first chapter, The Shine, with Jane Shepard.

I was raised in an extremely conservative, fundamentalist Christian home in the Midwest. I knew from a very young age that I was gay and that no one around me was a role model for the type of person I would be when I grew up. I turned to comic books and television to escape from this insular world and to seek alternative examples of how to live. I was craving someone to inspire me, someone to look up to: a hero. 
 
I read about and watched Batman and Spider-man, whose secretive duality I could identify with. There were empowered heroines, Wonder Woman and Batgirl, and heroes of color, Cyborg and Black Lightning; they were encouraging to me since being different didn't stop them from being heroic. But an actual LGBT hero? Or even a positive LGBT role model? Nowhere to be found. This was the seventies. LGBT characters were always villains, wacky neighbors or insane relatives. 
 
Today, of course, LGBT characters are much more visible and diverse in all media, including comic books. However, I still feel there aren't enough contemporary LGBT heroes, and there are even fewer LGBT teams. I hope that Orb, a series about a team of LGBT superheroes, will help fill this void.
 
What I Need and What You Get
 
The goal of the campaign was set at $3700 because that is how much money it will take to  produce the entire multi-issue first chapter, and enough money has 
not yet been raised to even complete the first issue.  But it's not too 
late!  There's still time left in the campaign. You can play an integral role in making sure that there are more 
LGBT role models in the media by contributing to this 
campaign and/or sending a link to this page to someone else you know who might like to contribute.  There are Perks available for every economic bracket.  
Whether you're a struggling artist or a wealthy philanthropist, any 
contribution you make will help insure that at least the first issue 
will be able to be fully produced.  


* In
 order to distribute the perks for $50 or more, at least enough money will need to be raised to produce the first issue.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Our story is a comedic follow-up to the timeless tale of Romeo and Juliet.  Basically, with apologies to Bill Shakespeare, we call BS.  How could two horn-dog teenagers who'd known one another for less than 48 hours have any idea whether or not they were actually in love?  Aren't you at all curious to see how our most famous couple would have ended up if they'd pulled it off and run away together?  What would that marriage be like after twenty years?  Here's your chance to find out....    </p>
<p><br/></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Our goal is to reexamine the most famous love story in the world from a new perspective, to bring our story to the big screen, and above all -- to make our audience laugh.  </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>

<p>James and I teamed together because we found we were burning to tell some special stories. The story of Sara Vargas is one of many we have in the pipeline and is the one that is the subject of this Indiegogo campaign.  We intend for the book to be an ongoing series. There is a definite end to the story but we are unsure as to exactly how many issues it will take to get there.  The first issue, a 40 pager, is practically finished (all that remains is 5 pages that need to be inked and colored) and we will be debuting an ashcan of the second issue at the NY Comic Con in October. Proceeds from the campaign will cover printing and production costs of the first and second issues, costs of attending the NY Comic Con, marketing costs, and commission costs for some of the rewards we are offering.  We have some high-powered artists on hand ready to contribute to the campaign and, like everyone else, even though they are nice guys, they need to be compensated. It's hard work but we think it's well worth it, as our goal is for people to want to come in and experience, enjoy and share in these worlds we've created.  </p>

<p>Emilio Rodriguez is a licensed practicing attorney in New York, as well as a college professor.  In terms of comics, his story is very typical.  After falling in love with comics as a child, he wrote and drew comics throughout his adolescence.  Early loves include the Carmine Infantino early Flash stories, Miller's run on Daredevil, Stan's run on X-Men, and many others.  As is the case usually (and unfortunately), he spent some time away from comics during his college and post-graduate years.  A failed collaboration with a friend stoked the fires of creativity inside him and now he plans to write until he has no more stories to tell, which he hopes won't be for a very long time to come.</p>
<p>James was bitten by the comics and illustration bug at an early age.  His influences come from an eclectic group of sources, including John Byrne, Arthur Adams, Norman Rockwell, Syd Mead, Ron Cobb, his favorite painter Diego Rodriguez de Velasquez, and his mother Ana who was a fashion designer in her home country of Ecuador.  He attended both the High School of Art &amp; Design and the School of Visual Arts in New York, where he studied under comic book legends Walt Simonson and Joe Orlando.  After graduation, he worked in film, television and theater before creating Novastar Studios to make and publish creator-owned titles.  He has worked on ""Quantum: Rock of Ages"" for Dreamchilde Press, ""Psychosis"" for Atlas Unleashed, and sketch cards for Breygent Marketing, Vampirella, Red Sonja, and Joe Linsner's Dawn.  He is proud of his Latino heritage and looks to create more Latino-centric comics, as well as create opportunities for other indie artists.</p>

<li>Tell people about your unique perks. Get them excited!</li>
<li>Describe where the funds go if you don’t reach your entire goal.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are actually very few challenges that will arise after the project is successfully funded.  We have already gone through all of the possible production delays and have gotten the story to exactly where we want it.  As stated before, the first issue is done except for 5 pages that need to be inked and colored, and we have started production on the second.  We will be done with the ashcan well before the NY Comic Con in October because it will be comprised of 13 black and white pages and will not require the full production time of a 32 page color issue.  We have hit a ""groove"" in terms of the production system we have in place, and because James and I have multiple roles we can execute the work faster instead of having to ""hand it off"" to someone else.</p>

<p><strong>Finances</strong></p>
<p>Having done 6 previous crowdfunding campaigns, I analyzed the projects on costs of each project by reward level, number of backers and shipping.  The following graph is my projection if the project is funded at $8,000.  (Assumptions: 200 Backers, average $40 spend and 20% backers foreign, similar to previous campaigns) Please note that there is no cost inserted for coloring, lettering and book design (my labor) nor is there a margin for ""profit"".  According to my previous Kickstarter's data, successful projects have had very small margins of profitability (less than 5%).  If we change to an off-set printers, that will change the finances (allowing for a smaller unit cost but requiring a large print order), and therefore will not move in that direction unless funded over 300%.</p>

<h3>Mythics and The Mythoverse</h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><i>Mythics</i> is part of a line of contemporary fantasy comics known as the <i>Mythoverse</i>. The first campaign was funded successfully just over a year ago, and despite a hiccup in fulfillment, we were able to deliver the inaugural issues of <i>Adobe Kroger: Dame Commander, Changeling: An Urban Fairytale<i>, </i></i>and <i>Mythics</i>. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Now we're pushing onto IndieGoGo to give a new audience a chance at the Issue One variants that were initially exclusive to the Kickstarter campaign. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In Issue One of <i>Mythics</i>, Elthia Fletcher, an agent of the Mythic Order, rescued a baby changeling named Arlene from a coven of witches set to sacrifice the baby to summon a demon lord. While Elthia was able to complete her job, complications arose when the coven alerted the Order of the Carolingian Cross. The rival Order sent a paladin team to investigate the baby's kidnapping. Sensing a greater conspiracy in the shadows, Elthia watches over Arlene with her fiance, Jarel, their familiars, and the newly arrived Morella.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">In Issue Two, Elthia is given a new job a few days after Issue One. A spriggan has been spotted in the same metropark where the coven tried to sacrifice Arlene. The problem is that Elthia's familiar Galatyn has been dealing with a family emergency, and Elthia is terrified of spriggans.  Will Elthia be able to overcome her fear of spriggans to do her job? Is there a connection between the coven and the spriggan?</span></p>

<p>Issue Two</p>
<p>With the relettering of Issue One after complaints about the dialogue, and lettering, I decided to learn how to letter. While the first issue is rather rough, the new dialogue improved the story. I think I improved quite a bit since relettering Issue One.</p>

</div></div>","Mythics and The Mythoverse
Mythics is part of a line of contemporary fantasy comics known as the Mythoverse. The first campaign was funded successfully just over a year ago, and despite a hiccup in fulfillment, we were able to deliver the inaugural issues of Adobe Kroger: Dame Commander, Changeling: An Urban Fairytale, and Mythics. 
Now we're pushing onto IndieGoGo to give a new audience a chance at the Issue One variants that were initially exclusive to the Kickstarter campaign. 
In Issue One of Mythics, Elthia Fletcher, an agent of the Mythic Order, rescued a baby changeling named Arlene from a coven of witches set to sacrifice the baby to summon a demon lord. While Elthia was able to complete her job, complications arose when the coven alerted the Order of the Carolingian Cross. The rival Order sent a paladin team to investigate the baby's kidnapping. Sensing a greater conspiracy in the shadows, Elthia watches over Arlene with her fiance, Jarel, their familiars, and the newly arrived Morella.
In Issue Two, Elthia is given a new job a few days after Issue One. A spriggan has been spotted in the same metropark where the coven tried to sacrifice Arlene. The problem is that Elthia's familiar Galatyn has been dealing with a family emergency, and Elthia is terrified of spriggans.  Will Elthia be able to overcome her fear of spriggans to do her job? Is there a connection between the coven and the spriggan?
Issue One's Pages





Issue Two
With the relettering of Issue One after complaints about the dialogue, and lettering, I decided to learn how to letter. While the first issue is rather rough, the new dialogue improved the story. I think I improved quite a bit since relettering Issue One.

Yes, they have numerous challenges; but at the same time, it is important to maintain perspective. There are countless conditions worse than bleeding disorders and in the grand scheme of things, being born a bleeder is preferable than being born with MS or cancer or sickle cell anemia (you get the picture). </p>
<p>While it may seem, to a clotter, we bleeders are afflicted with this terrible curse and will never experience the life which others would have wished for us; the reality is there is absolutely no reason to believe a bleeder’s life, especially today, will be any less full or rich or adventurous or rewarding than the life of our fully clotting peers. This isn’t romanticizing either. Bleeding disorders have in many ways become an affliction of the soul and mind just as much, if not more than, of the body; and it’s important we treat it in those regions as diligently and bravely as we do the body.</p>
<p>Even today, growing up with a bleeding disorder can be a challenge mentally for little bleeders. Most grownups, unsure of their potential ARE afraid to fully engage in life. Afraid to hear the constant, ""No, don't do that, you might get a bleed!"" They have feelings of being a defective kid who isn't ""normal.""</p>
<p>A common message older bleeders are beginning to spread to the younger generation is ""You have a bleeding disorder, it doesn't have you, own it!"" And that is our vision for the Hemo Hero.</p>
<p></p> <div> <h3></h3>
<p><b>Who is the Hemo Hero</b><b>?</b><br/>
Hemo Hero is the secret identity of Sebastian Weiss, a six-year-old hemophiliac. An engineering genius, he's able to develop sophisticated gadgets from household appliances and computer hardware, which he uses to come to the aid of hemophiliacs everywhere. Tired of bullies and ignorance, Sebastian is taking his fight to the streets. </p>
<p>That's where his big sister Sera comes in. At twelve, she has troubles of her own. She has to take care of Sebastian, protect his secret, and make sure they're both home in time for dinner. Her secret identity, Serum, has the ability to deliver clotting factor without a needle, which comes in handy when they get into serious scrapes. </p>
<p>Together, they are the Hemo Heroes; dispensing justice, educating the public, and just trying to get along.</p>

<br/><p>Hemo Hero is not only a comic book we have created; it is more than a comic, it is a project. It is a project we are so incredibly proud to be a part of. The theme of the Hemo Hero series is to help young bleeders feel empowered. We want our bleeding disorder brothers and sisters to know and understand a bleeding disorder is not a curse; instead, it should be viewed as a badge of courage. Additionally, Hemo Hero will tackle other problems bleeders face, such as bullying and their fear of needles.</p>
<p>We want all of you to be part of this vision so we can make sure our children also make the difference for the upcoming generations. If we begin now, our efforts can only help these kids realize their dreams. All it takes is ALL of you!</p>
<p>We are offering up 10 opportunities for people who support us in this vital early stage to appear in our comic!</p>
<p>The appearances you earn for backing this project won't get you some lame cameo as a random face in a crowd. If you're a character in our books, you will be a character Hemo Hero &amp; Serum interact with throughout the comic. We'll even send you a signed print of your appearance page. That is how we roll.</p>
<p>Three substantial characters are also up for grabs. Would you like to be The Whispering Shadow? The Emerald Mimic? How about The Ultra Hawk, a hero from Sebastian's favorite comic book – until a disruption in reality catapulted you into Sebastian's world where you fight alongside Hemo Hero &amp; Serum? We have some great roles available, but they are first-come, first-serve. So grab yours now!</p>
<p>We are already working on the beginning issues and have everything in place to succeed. Now, we could release as a digital comic on our own, but with the amazing story by Jason, stunning artwork of Jessica and the rich color by Jeremy, it would be a crime to restrict this story to computer screens.</p>

</div><p></p></div>","Bleeding disorders suck, especially when they prevent an activity or life choice from playing out as we would have preferred. Yes, they have numerous challenges; but at the same time, it is important to maintain perspective. There are countless conditions worse than bleeding disorders and in the grand scheme of things, being born a bleeder is preferable than being born with MS or cancer or sickle cell anemia (you get the picture). 
While it may seem, to a clotter, we bleeders are afflicted with this terrible curse and will never experience the life which others would have wished for us; the reality is there is absolutely no reason to believe a bleeder’s life, especially today, will be any less full or rich or adventurous or rewarding than the life of our fully clotting peers. This isn’t romanticizing either. Bleeding disorders have in many ways become an affliction of the soul and mind just as much, if not more than, of the body; and it’s important we treat it in those regions as diligently and bravely as we do the body.
Even today, growing up with a bleeding disorder can be a challenge mentally for little bleeders. Most grownups, unsure of their potential ARE afraid to fully engage in life. Afraid to hear the constant, ""No, don't do that, you might get a bleed!"" They have feelings of being a defective kid who isn't ""normal.""

<div><br/></div> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>As the first Mabinogi Anthology created by the Mabinogi NA Community, our message and purpose of the zine was to give back to the game itself. As we believed that Mabinogi has made an impact on our lives, through the memories we've made and the friends we met along the way. This is our contribution, thanks, love and nostalgia for Mabinogi.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul> </ul>
<div>Our individual prices are based on a stock of 50 Zine bundles, anything less than 50 individuals who contribute to the zine may cause some tight budgeting. However, we've allowed a window of 1 month and a few weeks to promote our zine! </div>
<div><ul>
<li>Shipping via. Canada Post</li>
<li>There are both tracked and non-track shipping rates for the USA and International</li>
<li>Canada automatically has tracked shipping (no non-track option)</li>
</ul></div> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul> </ul>
<div>Help us by spreading the word! Our campaigns lasts only from September 6th - October 30th, make sure to let your friends and fellow Milletians about the zine since we are distributing them for a <b>limited time</b> only! Meaning that the zines,  goodies and even the PDF will <b>NOT BE AVAILABLE </b>after the campaign has ended.</div>

All characters and locations depicted herein remain the trademarked possessions of devCAT studio and Nexon, co. ltd.
An Adventurer's Memoir: A Mabinogi Fanzine will be a Limited Edition zine available from September 6th, 2016 - October 30th, 2016. Meaning that the zine, goods and even the PDF will not be available after the end of the campaign. 
About Us
An Adventurer's Memoir is a non-profit zine organized by Gooeh and Narcotic Android, a full coloured anthology depicting the Mainstream Questline: Generation quests, The Saga: Iria, Divine Knights and Side Generation Quests. With our team of artists from the Mabinogi community, An Adventurer's Memoir will be available as a digital and physical along with bonus content of charms, buttons and mini prints.    The Goal & Its Perks
 
We've decided to go with a Flexible goal of $2,000 USD, a Flexible goal allows us to keep the funds by the end of the campaign despite not reaching our 'goal' since the funds generated are based on individuals. As long as we have  the funds to fulfill your perks you've ordered, this project will succeed!

Note: Images and merchandise shown are still in development, however there will be updates when they are finalized and produced!

   The Impact As the first Mabinogi Anthology created by the Mabinogi NA Community, our message and purpose of the zine was to give back to the game itself. As we believed that Mabinogi has made an impact on our lives, through the memories we've made and the friends we met along the way. This is our contribution, thanks, love and nostalgia for Mabinogi.
    Risks & Challenges
 
Our individual prices are based on a stock of 50 Zine bundles, anything less than 50 individuals who contribute to the zine may cause some tight budgeting. However, we've allowed a window of 1 month and a few weeks to promote our zine! 

Shipping via. Canada Post
There are both tracked and non-track shipping rates for the USA and International
Canada automatically has tracked shipping (no non-track option)

<p>What's up, you guys!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I've been writing erotic stories on the subject of domination for about ten years now. I'm a great fan of manga in general but hentai in particular and I would love to see one of my stories in drawing. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>The one I picked is called 'The sweet life of a Skater Boy' and it's the story of two teenage boys: Kieran and Finn. Finn is gay and after pretending otherwise for a few years he plucks up the courage to come out of the closet to his straight best friend Kieran, a skater boy who only thinks about skating and girls. Kieran is  surprised to hear the news but being shrewd and practical he takes advantage of the situation and convinces Finn to blow him, giving his friend a taste of something he will get totally addicted to.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>You can read the first chapter of the story (and all the next ones) by following this link: <a href=""https://www.nifty.org/nifty/gay/highschool/the-sweet-life-of-a-skater-boy/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.nifty.org/nifty/gay/highschool/the-...</a></p>
<p>I also have a blog if you want to check it out:</p>
<p><a href=""http://naughtybardblog.jimdo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://naughtybardblog.jimdo.com</a></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I already contacted a fantastic manga artist to draw the first chapter, the thing is it's very expensive and I would appreciate all the help you can give me, guys!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Of course each of you will receive a digital copy of the manga once it's finished.</p>

<p>I want to thank you all in advance for any contribution!</p>

<h3><strong>ABOUT THE STORY:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Outbreak is a 24 page full colour book.<br/></strong></p>
<p>Twenty-six year-old nurse Taylor Martin is a nurse working at an inner city hospital. An energetic, strong and independent young woman, Taylor sees it as her mission in life to cure the world of its troubles – beginning by convincing her friend, Holly, to give up smoking.</p>
<p>But a normal day at work turns into a nightmare for the two friends when they’re sent to the site of an incident in the city centre. They arrive on the scene to find a military-controlled quarantine surrounding a group of office buildings. Information is being kept tightly under wraps, but Taylor and Holly are instructed to treat the victims of a rampant and unknown virus. The terrifying illness strips the flesh from its victims, driving them insane before finally killing them.</p>
<p>Despite the efforts of medical personnel, the situation is rapidly spiralling out of control. Taylor and Holly work to contain the spread, but it appears the only cure is death.</p>
<p>As a state of emergency is declared and the military take complete control, Taylor and Holly are horrified to find they are now included in the quarantine zone, and are ordered to remain inside their specified area – a tent set up to treat the victims.</p>
<p>Unknown to those inside the tent, the military is being recalled – the situation has become uncontrollable, with the virus spreading to other parts of the city. Those inside the quarantine zone – dead or alive – are being abandoned.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>ABOUT US:</strong></h3>
<p>Conan is the artist and creator of Outbreak. He is a dedicated artist who has been drawing since childhood, and has a keen interest in digital art. He completed an Advanced Diploma of Game Design in 2010 and currently runs his own games studio - Sinars Studios.</p>
<p>My name is Ruth and I am the writer of Outbreak. I have been writing since I was twelve and have a deep love for literature and film in all forms and genres, and I’ve completed a Bachelor of Arts/Diploma of Arts in Professional Writing and Editing. Writing Outbreak has given me a chance to let my imagination roam free, and I’m looking forwards to writing the rest of the series!</p>
<p>Conan and I began to work on Outbreak around a year ago, following a concept Conan had. We’ve drawn inspiration from many of the great disaster movies and books, as well as our unlimited imaginations, by asking ourselves ‘what would happen if ...?’</p>
<p>Our aim in this story is to create believable and interesting characters and present the complex situation surrounding them. By placing this incongruent group in a world where there are no laws, there are boundless possibilities. Every minute can lead to a twist and every action can create new problems. We are eager to show how these characters develop throughout the series.</p>

Who am I? 
My name is Josh Howard and I've worked as a professional comic book writer/artist for over 15 years. I am best known for my indie action/horror series DEAD@17 published by Image Comics.

<h2><strong>Outworld: The Summary</strong></h2>
<p>Hey, there!</p>
<p>First of all, thanks to all of you who contributed to our initial fundraisng campaign. All of your help is greatly appreciated. If you'd like to check out our initial campaign, click here:</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/outworld-return-of-the-master-teachers"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/outworld-retu...</a></p>
<p>I'm Jiba Anderson, owner of Griot Enterprises and creator of its flagship title, The Horsemen. This spring, we're releasing the next addition to our roster,<strong><em> Outworld: Return of the Master Teachers</em></strong>, and we need your help to make this happen. </p>
<h2>
<strong>Outworld: </strong><strong>The Premise</strong>
</h2>
<p><strong><em>Outworld: Return of the Master Teachers</em></strong> is a science fiction, kung-fu epic spanning 3 generations.</p>
<p>The Master Teachers have been outlawed and hunted to the brink of extinction by one of their own. The Diaspora System is under the iron grip of Oro, The Despot and his Beret Sheri armada led by his acolyte, The Paladin. The Diaspora, once a galaxy devoted to peace and diversity, has become the Utopia, a totalitarian society dedicated to expanding its territories through war, subjugation and destruction.</p>
<p>However, a rag tag band of rebels led by a disgraced Master will provide to the key to the Diaspora’s liberation and will ignite a revolution that will restore the glory of the Master Teachers and bring justice to a beleaguered solar system.</p>
<p>Outworld is a property geared towards males aged 10 -35. In addition, females in the same age bracket may become a large part of our audience as well due to a strong, capable female cast in the series. Finally, we may find a large adult audience as well. Outworld is reminiscent of such properties as <strong><em>Star Wars</em></strong>, <strong><em>Dreadstar &amp; Warp</em></strong> and kung-fu films such as <strong><em>Hero</em></strong> and <strong><em>The Five Deadly Venoms</em></strong>. </p>
<h2><strong>Outworld: The Final Package</strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>Outworld: Return of the Master Teachers</em></strong> will be released as two 24-page issues in digital format as well as a 64-page “Expanded edition” print graphic novel. The book will distributed through<strong>Amazon</strong>, <strong>Comic Flea Market</strong>, <strong>Drive Thru Comics</strong>, <strong>Graphicly</strong>, <strong>IndyPlanet</strong> and <strong>Lulu</strong>.</p>
<h2><strong>Real Talk, we need some dough... </strong></h2>
<p>Here’s the deal: we are looking to raise <strong>$1500.00</strong> to help with production, marketing and printing costs. Here’s a breakdown of how the funds will be disbursed:</p>
<p>•         <strong>35%</strong> will go to finishing the production of the book</p>
<p>•         <strong>25%</strong> will go to the printing of the graphic novel</p>
<p>•         <strong>25%</strong> will go to funding convention appearances throughout the spring   and summer (C2E2, ECBACC, Motor City Black Age &amp; SDCC)</p>
<p>•         <strong>15%</strong> will go to advertising the book via pay-per-click channels.</p>
<h2><strong>The Cool Stuff</strong></h2>
<div>
<p>Of course you’ll get some really cool incentives based on how much you donate…Here they are!</p>
<p>•            <strong>$5.00</strong> – You will have a place in the thank you section of the upcoming <strong><em>Outworld: Return of the Master Teachers </em></strong>digital issues and printed graphic novel and a FREE PDF copy of <strong><em>Outworld: Return of the Master Teachers</em></strong>’ FIRST AND SECOND issues.</p>
<p>•            <strong>$15.00</strong> – All of the rewards above PLUS a FREE AND SIGNED PRINTED copy of <strong><em>Outworld: Return of the Master Teachers</em></strong>.</p>
<p>•            <strong>$25.00</strong> – All of the rewards above plus a FREE AND SIGNED <strong><em>Outworld: Return of the Master Teachers </em></strong>11” X 17” promotional print!</p>
<p>•            <strong>$50.00</strong> – All of the rewards above plus a FREE <strong><em>Outworld: Return of the Master Teachers</em></strong>T-shirt!</p>
<p>•            <strong>$100.00</strong> (limited to 20) – All of the rewards above plus a <strong><em>Outworld: Return of the Master Teachers </em></strong>promotional FREE AND SIGNED PORTFOLIO series (8 prints) FREE!</p>
<p>•             <strong>$150.00</strong> (limited to 10) – All of the rewards above plus an ORIGINAL sketch of a character from <strong><em>Outworld: Return of the Master Teachers</em></strong>.</p>
<p>If we don’t reach our entire goal, we’ll still push on. The book will be completed and all incentives will be honored. That’s how we do at Griot… Can’t stop, won’t stop!</p>
<h2><strong>The deal about Griot…</strong></h2>
<div>
<strong> </strong>Since 2000, Griot Enterprises has existed for one reason: To tell great stories featuring heroes of color.
<div class=""user-content"">
<div>
<p>We have seen many great African American superheroes in comics, but we never saw an iconic African American superhero team. We didn’t have our Justice League, our Avengers. We, as comic book fans of color, young and old, didn’t have a universe where our heroes reside...</p>
<p>... With the release of <strong><em>The Horsemen</em></strong> in 2002, Griot Enterprises filled that void.</p>
<p>Now, we are expanding our horizons and redefining what makes a hero for future generations. From pulp fiction to science fiction, from prose to graphic novels and animation, Griot Enterprises knows no boundaries…</p>
<p>… And honestly, Black heroes are cool.</p>

<p><b>Gateway Runners is a four issue series written by Gene Hoyle, with art by Aaron and Kitty Pierce. </b></p>

<p><b><u>The world of Gateway Runners</u></b></p>
<p><b>The population of Earth grows at a rapid pace. With Terraforming now possible, the expansion into space is both feasible and necessary. </b></p>
<p><b>An ark containing 100,000 of some of our best and brightest leaves Earth for the eighteen month journey to Mars.....and disappears!</b></p>
<p><b>The colonization must happen, and a second ark is built. Many are hesitant to make this trip given the disaster of Ark One, so the passengers are given little choice in the matter.</b></p>
<p><b>Ten years go by with no real contact between the worlds. Mars is a lush farmland, but lacks needed tech to thrive. Earth has continued to rapidly grow in population. </b></p>
<p><b>Something needs to change. </b></p>
<p><b>Anton Lehrer, passenger on the second Ark,has a plan and special ability that can make the worlds come together. </b></p>
<p><b>When he mysteriously appears on Earth, many powerful people need to make sure that he goes back where he came from, or disappears.....</b></p>

<b><br/>
</b><p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>The future depicted in Gateway Runners is described by our writer as ""Part of the way to the Star Trek future"" . There are huge scientific and technological advances, but the people still have a lot to learn. What the Runners can do may be able to push humanity in the right direction. </b></p>
<p><b>It was important to Hoyle to show that we have made great strides as a society on the way to this future. Though not directly stated in the book, you can see that many characters are of mixed heritage. Race is not an issue, or an excuse <span style="""">to hate. Though far from perfect, humanity has changed for the better. </span></b></p>
<p><span style=""""><b>Each new tech introduced in the book was deliberately added because it was a logical step in the authors view of what is to come. Nothing exists purely as a plot device, with the exception of the Gateways themselves. (Which Gene insists COULD be possible) </b></span></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><b>Gateway Runners is a story that we believe can touch readers. Our diverse cast and their mission can inspire as well as entertain. Though written with an adult crowd in mind, Runners can be enjoyed by anyone 12 and up. </b></p>
<p><b>We intend on giving away a part of the print run to literacy programs locally. Nerd Nation Publishing strongly believes that comic books are ""gateways"" to reading. </b></p>
<p><b>Our writer struggled with reading until introduced to the world of comics. He intends on repaying that debt. </b></p>

<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><b>This fund raiser will go to printing the book, and to finish paying the art team. Through sales of the zero issue, we have raised much of what we need.  The book itself is almost finished. We expect to go to the printers the day this campaign ends. </b></p>
<p><b> Whether or not we are successful here, the book will happen.  The only thing that changes is the time frame. If you pledge here, you WILL get what you pay for.  This project is one of passion. We have all suffered from late delivery on fund raisers. We are going to do our very best to avoid this. We want lifelong fans, not one time pledges. </b></p>

<b><br/>
</b><p><b><u>The Tiers</u></b></p>
<p><b>Our pledge levels contain some great prizes. From even $1.00, you get the digital prelude. Entitled ""Rock Bottom"", it explores Anton Lehrer's dark past, and his first meetings with other cast members. This prelude will be released one chapter at a time, coinciding with the release of each issue. </b></p>

Keep sharing, and give if you can!  Most of all, THANK YOU!


Anton Lehrer was exiled to Mars for murder. He mysteriously reappears on Earth with an agenda that includes recruiting Phillip Flynn, a young man with little ambition and an amazing ability.  People in power want Anton to fail, and disappear. If they succeed, two worlds are doomed!


Gateway Runners is a four issue series written by Gene Hoyle, with art by Aaron and Kitty Pierce. 





The world of Gateway Runners
The population of Earth grows at a rapid pace. With Terraforming now possible, the expansion into space is both feasible and necessary. 
An ark containing 100,000 of some of our best and brightest leaves Earth for the eighteen month journey to Mars.....and disappears!
The colonization must happen, and a second ark is built. Many are hesitant to make this trip given the disaster of Ark One, so the passengers are given little choice in the matter.
Ten years go by with no real contact between the worlds. Mars is a lush farmland, but lacks needed tech to thrive. Earth has continued to rapidly grow in population. 
Something needs to change. 
Anton Lehrer, passenger on the second Ark,has a plan and special ability that can make the worlds come together. 
When he mysteriously appears on Earth, many powerful people need to make sure that he goes back where he came from, or disappears.....




The future depicted in Gateway Runners is described by our writer as ""Part of the way to the Star Trek future"" . There are huge scientific and technological advances, but the people still have a lot to learn. What the Runners can do may be able to push humanity in the right direction. 
It was important to Hoyle to show that we have made great strides as a society on the way to this future. Though not directly stated in the book, you can see that many characters are of mixed heritage. Race is not an issue, or an excuse to hate. Though far from perfect, humanity has changed for the better. 
Each new tech introduced in the book was deliberately added because it was a logical step in the authors view of what is to come. Nothing exists purely as a plot device, with the exception of the Gateways themselves. (Which Gene insists COULD be possible) 
The Runners team, from Gene's script to Kitty and Aaron's contributions, not just to art but to plot, have created a world that is both interesting and possible. 








The Impact
Gateway Runners is a story that we believe can touch readers. Our diverse cast and their mission can inspire as well as entertain. Though written with an adult crowd in mind, Runners can be enjoyed by anyone 12 and up. 
We intend on giving away a part of the print run to literacy programs locally. Nerd Nation Publishing strongly believes that comic books are ""gateways"" to reading. 
Our writer struggled with reading until introduced to the world of comics. He intends on repaying that debt. 



What We Need & What You Get
This fund raiser will go to printing the book, and to finish paying the art team. Through sales of the zero issue, we have raised much of what we need.  The book itself is almost finished. We expect to go to the printers the day this campaign ends. 
 Whether or not we are successful here, the book will happen.  The only thing that changes is the time frame. If you pledge here, you WILL get what you pay for.  This project is one of passion. We have all suffered from late delivery on fund raisers. We are going to do our very best to avoid this. We want lifelong fans, not one time pledges. 



The Tiers
Our pledge levels contain some great prizes. From even $1.00, you get the digital prelude. Entitled ""Rock Bottom"", it explores Anton Lehrer's dark past, and his first meetings with other cast members. This prelude will be released one chapter at a time, coinciding with the release of each issue. 
A super limited amount of Gateway Runners zero will also be part of a tier.







The Mel Madigan as MJ print is part of a tier that also includes a print of Mel's character, Felicia. (Both prints below)




Artist Aaron ""Aarpie"" Pierce is offering character sketches as part of a limited tier. You may chose a character from Runners or a character from another book that you enjoy.




Almost every tier gets you something cool and we will be adding tiers throughout the campaign. 

Another vital aspect to our success is YOU! We can't do it without your help! If you like what you see, share this campaign with friends. We hope to beat our goal, and show you our insane scratch goals!

In closing, we think that Gateway Runners is a comic book that you will love. Give it a try and see for yourself!

Our Time in Eden began as a novel, written by Gibson Twist in 1995, then languished for many years. Gibson met Ben Steeves in 2005 at a local comic-making event, teaming up to win cash and prizes in a collaborative comicking marathon. A unique artistic connection formed quickly between them, and they began discussing a larger project. Ben chose Our Time in Eden.<p></p>

<p>The project was first posted online at <a href=""http://ourtimeineden.smackjeeves.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">ourtimeineden.smackjeeves.com</a> in 2008, gaining critical acclaim and small, devoted audience.

</p><h3></h3><p>Firstly let us thank you for taking the time to look at our Indigogo campaign and to read this pitch!  </p>
<p>Shadows In The Blood is a webcomic, updating twice a week, that follows the adventures of Teran, Reim and co, created by Enka McEvoy and Cymon Wing. Enka does all of the drawing and colouring for the comic along with most of the writing. I help write the story and mostly steal credit for the best bits Enka has come up with but is too tired to remember doing.  We both work full-time jobs and create Shadows in our free time and the project has become somewhat a labour of love for us. We've already achieved several of our goals with Shadows In The Blood; with the help of our tech team, we've built our own website for the comic, we've been to our local comic conventions with Shadows and been very well received, we even printed the first story arc (at our own expense) and gave it away free to fans at the convention! <br/><br/>But now we need your help.  Our drawing tablet that had served us so well up to now has died and without it we’re struggling to keep updating the comic.  Moving forward from this we really want to upgrade our equipment, enabling us to put out even better pages at a faster rate. We want to give you, the readers, the best comic we can possibly make, as often as we can possibly make it. A Wacom Cintiq has been on our wish list for almost 2 years now and the more funding we get, the better Cintiq we can buy.  Our base goal of £800 lets us buy a Cintiq 13HD, a very useful piece of kit! <span>Shadows In The Blood is a live project, its happening now and we’re asking you to help us continue to make it happen. We're not asking for a handout to get an idea going, we asking for funding to make it better. To make a good product great. We're asking for help to make one of our life goals a reality! Our dream is make make Shadows In The Blood our full-time jobs, to give 100% of our time and energy to the project but without funding to get us going, that cannot happen. Please make the dream of two comic creators come true.<br/><br/>Thank you for your time, thanks in advance for your donation and thank you for sharing this campaign with your friends via social media. The more people that hear about this project the better the chance of it succeeding!</span></p>

Mucho Man is a farcical super hero romp that stars a Mexican superhero living in a world in which there exists a United Nations of heroes. Each country is represented by an arche/stereo typical character.
The Mucho Man comicbook is an ongoign series.  Issues will become available through the Mucho Man website every 5 or 6 weeks.  The book will be in black and white with color covers.
I plan to promote and sell Mucho Man as a digital comic book.  This Indiegogo campaign is the begining of what I hope will be a long career and the fulfillment of a life-long dream.

<h2>Is privacy dead?  </h2>
<p>Many people want to declare that privacy is dead or that it's not important anymore. That's because these people want to get rich by exploiting it. </p>
<p>From the revelations of Edward Snowden in 2013, the American people have learned how the government has complete access to your online lives. Nowadays, everyone carries a tracking device on them at all times. We trust Google to give us directions, Uber to take us home, and Facebook for our social lives. But what if someone on the inside of one companies had bad intentions? </p>
<p>My name is Mars Black. Obviously, this is a pseudonym. There are many reasons for this. </p>
<p>Corporations want to know everything about us. The more they want to know, the less I want toreveal anything about myself. I put this project on IndieGogo specifically because their competitor would force me to reveal my name. </p>
<p>This story will illustrate how powerful knowledge really is!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>About me</strong></h3>
<p>I've been an artist my entire life. When I was a kid, I was completely crazy (politically correct term - hyperactive or ADD.) The only time I could sit still was when I was making art. This is still true today. </p>
<p>I was fortunate enough to meet my mentor John Tartaglione when I was 10. John was a Marvel comic artist who drew one of the best selling comics of all time. (The Life of Pope John Paul II.) He helped me develop my art skills and got me into drawing from life.  </p>
<p>When I became a teenager, I became obsessed with photography and making movies.  When I was trying to decide whether to go to film school or art school, Mr Tartaglione recommended I go for film. He told me that if I could always come back to comics. </p>
<p>For the last ten years, I've been working as a commercial cinematographer and film professor (for three of them), but making a comic has always been my dream. </p>
<p>Apex Huntor is the result. </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Thanks for taking a moment to check out our campaign. My name is Brandon Barrows and I've been writing comics for almost four years. <em>Red Run</em> is my first real foray into horror, along with my artist collaborator Joel Cotejar. Joel and I have worked together on several short stories in the past, but this is our first full-length story done together.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""margin-left: 90px;""><img alt=""Red Run Cover"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.brandonbarrowscomics.com/uploads/5/0/0/7/5007083/1890822_orig.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-right: 5px; margin-left: 5px; vertical-align: baseline;"" title=""Red Run""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em>Red Run</em> is a one-shot comic (twenty-eight story pages) telling the story of the McConnells, a down-on-their-luck family desperately in need of a fresh start. Packing only what will fit into a trailer, young parents Becky and David move their two small children, Dina and Ben, out of state to an unassuming town somewhere in America's heartland in order to seek employment. They rent a cheap apartment and make a surprise discovery that seems like a dream come true, only for it to be the beginning of Becky's nightmares.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About Brandon</strong></p>
<p>Brandon is a lifelong comic fanatic. He can almost literally not remember a time when he was not enthralled by comics, and writing them is a dream come true.</p>
<p>He has been called an ""amazing genre writer"" by Geoff Arbuckle of A Comic Book Blog and Tommy Hancock of FanBoyBuzz called his writing ""brilliant"". Brandon is humbled, awed and grateful that someone would think that highly of him. </p>
<p>On his most recent work, JACK HAMMER, reviewers have said such varied things as:</p>
<p>""I can't remember the last time I found a hero so likeable...there is a lot to squee about here"" - Sequential Tart</p>
<p>""<em>Jack Hammer</em> is a picture perfect example of high quality gritty noir storytelling."" - Comics Forge</p>
<p>He hopes RED RUN will be as well received.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About Joel</strong></p>
<p>Joel is an artist whose talents have variously been lent towards comics, children's books and advertising in styles as varied as the mediums he works in.</p>
<p>Joel's art has been referred to as ""sleek"", as possessing ""the spirit of the masters of the genre"" and as ""simply gorgeous"".</p>
<p>Reviewers have said about his work:</p>
<p>""Dynamic"" - Jason C, featured reviewer on DriveThruComics</p>
<p>""Quite good...comforting on a visual level"" - A Comic Book Blog</p>
<p>Joel hopes readers will be as excited about RED RUN as he is.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The object of this campaign is to raise $1000 to partially fund the creation of the comic. Joel is a professional working artist, both in comics and in other fields such as advertising, with a family to support and as such simply cannot afford to work on a book with no guaranteed pay.</p>
<p><br/>While we both feel strongly about this story, that it's one that needs to be told and will be enjoyed by many, I cannot afford to pay him everything he is due. That's why we need your help because I can't do it alone and without you, this story may not see the light of the day.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are seeking to raise $1000, just over half of what the total cost of doing this book will run. I am paying the other half out of my own pocket and the funds raised here will go to paying Joel for his time, effort and the supplies neccessary to pencil, ink and color the comic. I am not taking any page rate as writer of the book, nor is our editor Martin Brandt taking any pay for his contribution.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If, through your generosity, we raise more than $1000 the extra funds will go towards paying the remainder of the money owed to Joel, as well as to paying the letterer of the book.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When the book has been completed, it will be shopped around various independent publishers seeking a home that will publish and distribute the book so it can be discovered and enjoyed by folks across the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And, as much as we need your help, we don't expect you to shell out without getting something in return. Donation gifts vary with the amount donated, of course, and include the following:</p>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>All donors will receive a ""thank you"" mentioning their name on a special page set up on my website at the conclusion of the campaign.</li>
<li>Digital copies of a special Indie GoGo version of the final book</li>
<li>Physical copies, signed by the writer, of a special Indie GoGo version of the final book</li>
<li>Limited edition prints of the cover art, signed by the writer</li>
<li>Original production art (actual penciled pages of sequential art)</li>
<li>Original, custom sketches done by Joel</li>
<li>A professional comic credit, listing you as executive producer of the comic (<strong>with $500 donation only</strong>)</li>
</ul><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're not able to help financially, please consider donating your time by sharing this project with your friends, family, co-workers, etc. You truly are helping us reach an important goal for us and it's as simple as sharing our link on Facebook, Twitter, or Google Plus. Every additional link to the campaign, or word about it to a friend, helps and we will be extremely grateful.</p>

</div></div>","{Ita} Ghost Stories è un book che raccoglie storie a fumetti e illustrazioni di 39 artisti italiani, composto da più di 120 pagine a colori rilegate in brossura.

{Eng} Ghost Stories is an anthology that collects comics and illustrations by 39 Italian artists. It consists of more than 120 color pages. 
The project was born from the desire to combine the passion for visual art and a theme that has always fascinated us, and was made possible by the collaboration of brilliant minds and unique talents that we have selected among emerging personalities or that we have always admired in the Italian art! [note: the book is in Italian! But you can enjoy the beautiful illustrations too!!]


{Ita} Ideato da Andrea Sodaro (Illustratore) e Alessandro Pecin (Graphic Designer), il book colleziona fumetti e illustrazioni di una vasta cerchia di abili artisti italiani, tra cui: Paola Zanghì, Giuseppe Balestra, Helena Masellis, Ilaria Grieco, Ilaria Catalani, Kalina Hristova Muhova, Laura Borio, Lonnie Bao, Martina Fari, Monica Sangermano, Paolo Traisci, Renata Castellani, Rosalia Radosti, Silvia Vanni, Ste Tirasso, Tommaso Lucchetti, Valeria Viero, Andrea De Dominicis, Agnese Innocente, Alejandra Salvaterra, Alessandro Abbadini, Alessia Trunfio, Angelo Pintore, Cecilia Ferri, Daniela Giubellini, Elisa DueBì, Emanuele Galletto, Enzo Triolo, Erica Dalle Luche, Fabio Mancini, Federica Frenna, Federico D'Amore, Francesco Corigliano, Freddie Tanto, Giorgia Marras, Gloria Goderecci, Nicola Pezzato.
Insomma.. Un gran bel mix di mani d'oro! Da non lasciarsi sfuggire l'opportunità di avere un prodotto creato dall'unione di tanti ragazzi con una passione comune!
{Eng} Designed by Andrea Sodaro (Illustrator) e Alessandro Pecin (Graphic Designer), the anthology includes comic stories and illustrations by a wide circle of artists whose names you can read a few lines above!



{Ita} Abbiamo individuato come goal per questa campagna di crowdfunding 3.000€.

Infine le tasse di Indiegogo e Paypal vanno calcolate sul 15% del totale.
Nel caso in cui non dovessimo raggiungere il tetto prestabilito i fondi torneranno a voi!

<h3>The Name Of This Comic Is Reverb</h3>
My name is Flynn Nicholls and I'm an illustrator from Baltimore. (You know, like Ace of Cakes?) Last year, as an exercise to stay productive, I started doing brief, off-the cuff comics with no thumbnailing or scripting. I didn't have to like them, I just had to finish them.<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Out of this exercise came Reverb, a comic about Cool Dog, Jolene, and Sobek,  three friends in a weirdo city who sometimes frustrate each other. Reverb itself is more fully realized while still retaining the lo-fi, impromptu spirit of its origin. I'm really excited about it and I'd like to share it with YOU, in the form of not ONE, but TWO BOOKS! Both making their print debut at Small Press Expo 2013! Whoa!   </p>
<p>

<h3>I'm Going To Ask You For Money But I'll Give You Something In Return</h3>
<p>I'm asking for money to get some quality minis printed! Many of the strips are in color, and so I'd like to print in color--which is definitely going to run up the cost. If I have anything left over, it'll go toward table costs for SPX. </p>
<p>YOU, the contributor, will receive digital and/or print copies of the book, plus other cool things based on the donation levels on the right! Wow!</p>

<p>Comics are my #1 passion in life and being able to share that with other people is amazing. Creating a book is always a learning experience and with this project I'm hoping to expand beyond what I've done before. I couldn't do it without the support of friends and people who like what I do, for which I am eternally grateful.</p>

My name is Flynn Nicholls and I'm an illustrator from Baltimore. (You know, like Ace of Cakes?) Last year, as an exercise to stay productive, I started doing brief, off-the cuff comics with no thumbnailing or scripting. I didn't have to like them, I just had to finish them.
 
Out of this exercise came Reverb, a comic about Cool Dog, Jolene, and Sobek,  three friends in a weirdo city who sometimes frustrate each other. Reverb itself is more fully realized while still retaining the lo-fi, impromptu spirit of its origin. I'm really excited about it and I'd like to share it with YOU, in the form of not ONE, but TWO BOOKS! Both making their print debut at Small Press Expo 2013! Whoa!   
 





I'm Going To Ask You For Money But I'll Give You Something In Return
I'm asking for money to get some quality minis printed! Many of the strips are in color, and so I'd like to print in color--which is definitely going to run up the cost. If I have anything left over, it'll go toward table costs for SPX. 
YOU, the contributor, will receive digital and/or print copies of the book, plus other cool things based on the donation levels on the right! Wow!

Creating a book is always a learning experience and with this project I'm hoping to expand beyond what I've done before. I couldn't do it without the support of friends and people who like what I do, for which I am eternally grateful.

<h3><br/></h3>
<p>My name is James Fuller and I am a Canadian born fiction/fantasy/horror author and have written several titles that I have Indie Published. My epic fantasy series Fall of a King, my anthology Broken Shards of a Masterpiece and of course my dark fiction revenge tale, Unforgivable. All of which have gathered a respectable fan base and garnished some amazing reviews.</p>
<p>I have been writing for nearly a decade but only in the last two years have begun to take it seriously and venture into the world of publishing. Like many writers I sent off to several publishing houses and found rejection due to mostly my lack of having an established name. So with that I decided to take matters into my own hands and begin to make a name and a platform for myself and began Indie publishing my books in hopes that one day a Traditional Publishing house will finally pick me and my work up. But in the mean time I have a lot of books to write and several projects to work on such as this one, which is by far the biggest venture for me so far.</p>
<p>When the idea for Unforgivable first came to me, it was indeed an idea for a dark comic series. Much like the Punisher or Witch Blade etc. And so I began to write it. Since I had never written a comic layout and formate before I wrote it how I have always written and that is as a full story that could later be broken down into separate scenes and pages. Once I had the first 3 Issues written up I began searching for an artist willing to team up with me on this exciting journey. Well needless to say many were interested but few came through and fewer were willing to work as a partner on the project in hopes of getting paid for their hard work and countless hours drawing and colouring each Issue. So I decided to put the dreams of seeing Unforgivable as graphic novels aside for a time and just write them as books in hope that one day I would find the right artist.</p>
<p>Well almost 2 years have gone by since then, both Unforgivable 1 and 2 have been out and published for over a year and have made considerable headway in the Indie publishing world. Both have sold several hundred copies and have received many great reviews. Unforgivable 1 has 25 reviews and holds a 4.7 out of 5 star rating on Amazon where Unforgivable 2 has 12 reviews and has a 4.9 out of 5. And last month I released news that there will indeed be a Unforgivable 3 to be released Spring of 2014.</p>
<p>About a month a go a friend of mine asked me how my plans for the graphic novels were going and I admitted to him that I might have to give up on it for a few years because I hadn't been able to find the right artist for the job. The he told me about a friend of his who might be interested and so I went to bed that night not holding my breath. To my surprise come morning I had a email awaiting me from Jamie Scherer asking about the project. I filled her in on what was needed, how I wanted to do it and the problems I have been facing. She was thrilled about the project and the possibilities it could mean for her own artistic career and if all else the practise it would bring.</p>
<p>After several lengthy emails we came to terms on what we wanted/needed from each other to make this work and have partnered up to not only see my dream of seeing my series turned into the graphic novel series it was always meant to be but also to help her further her own career as an artist.</p>
<p>Because the magnitude of work needed to create a single comic book, and the hours Jamie will spend drawing and colouring each page, I could never ask her to do it for completely free and just for profit shares. Each page takes her between 3 and 6 hours, but since she believes so much in this story and what turning it into a graphic novel will do she has agreed to draw each page for $15, plus profit shares on sales.</p>
<p>Each comic will be between 20 and 25 pages long, ranging her costs to $300 to $375 per comic.</p>
<p>The $1400 we hope to raise is to fund the first 3 comics in the series. There will be 42 in total, but of course we want to see if we can make this happen and so we are starting small and going for just the first 3 and then from there we hope that profits will be able to pay for the the other 39 our fingers are crossed.</p>
<p>Most of that money $1100 is to pay Jamie for her to draw the 3 comics which is going to be roughly between 72 and 75 pages in total. That is the bulk of the money.</p>
<p>Then $90 will be formatting costs so we may have it not only on Kindle but also be able to order print copies from Createspace.</p>
<p>Then the remaining $210 will go to printing copies for the several book store and comic shops that already carry copies of my other books. Also to show our appreciation to those who contributed to the cause, with signed books and comics.</p>
<p>None of the money is directly for me but for the project itself and to see it to completion.</p>
<p>Depending of what people Contribute, you can get your hands on not only the first comics themselves signed by myself (author) and Jamie (artist) but even the Unforgivable novels as well. Book marks, and even special thanks within the comics themselves or on our facebook page. We appreciate every dollar given to the cause and all money raised goes towards making this dream come true.</p>
<p>We hope if all goes well that before the end of 2013 the first comic will be finished and ready!</p>
<p>If we only raise part of the funds we will ensure the first comic is finished and hopefully be able to go further next time.</p>
<p>We understand that not everyone has the extra means to help and donate, but that doesn't mean that you cannot help us. Spreading the word of our campaign anywhere you can is a big help! So please feel free to share our links and tell others who might be interested.</p>
<p>We thank you all.</p>

<p>Some info on Jamie Scherer</p>
<p>As a child I first loved art when I started to color pictures in Pre-school. For me that was a lot of fun, and I would doodle and draw and paint, I got every marker, paint, color pencil and crayon I could find to create something special. Now I am a student at Bowling Green State University continuing my love for art and trying to obtain my Bachelor in Fine Arts Degree. I would say that painting is my favorite thing do, but I also love drawing and photography and even digital painting. Digital painting is something I discovered late in high school and I gained a real interest in it. I started to research about it and look at other peoples work that used Photoshop to create a painting. So I began to fall in love with this style and created work of my own. Now my dream after I graduate is to become and illustrator/concept artist for a company. I am somewhat living my dream early by helping to create this comic series. My favorite thing to create is dark, scary things that make it hard for you to sleep at night. I am 21 years old and my life is just beginning and hopefully this is a grand beginning. <br/><br/>-Jamie<br/></p>
