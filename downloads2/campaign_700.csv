<h3>We are The Ark Car</h3>
<p>The Ark Car is an interactive and mobile community art project that can act as both a stationary or roving art piece. The Ark is being built on a GMC 2001 3500 flatbed truck which is completely self-contained and modular. When complete, the Ark Car will feature a 10,000 watt sound system with DJ equipment, a dance platform that can hold over 50 humans or animals, 100 independently programmed Nanoleaf panels projecting waves of light around the Ark, a plounge and a pizza kitchen!</p>

<h3>Where is my money going?</h3>
<p>Our total budget for The Ark Car is $40,000. We have already built the steel support structure, sheet-metal hull panels and deck flooring.

<h3>Why We Built The Ark</h3>
<p>We draw inspiration from the mythological Ark that saved humanity from the destructive force of nature. Our Ark sails towards fulfilling a similar ideal - a lifeship that nourishes creativity and propels our community forward. As part of Toronto's growing Art Car community, we envision the Ark as a platform for artistic expression and we've poured our blood, sweat, and tears into this vessel to make it happen. Now it's up to you to help us carry our vision forward into the future. </p>

<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>The Ark Car Team is comprised of artists, builders, and GSD burners. Our core construction team leads are David Fradkin, Matthew Languay, and Jonathan Stein. David Fradkin designed and built Kaleidoscopic (2015) which appeared at Burning Man and Nuit Blanche Toronto before being sold at the Autumnal Ball Auction in support of the Black Rock Arts Foundation. Matthew Languay built and owns Basecamp Climbing gym and brings a wealth of carpentry project management knowledge. Jonathan Stein is a founding member of Heavy Meta (2017), a Toronto-based fire-breathing dragon art car and a long time event planner and promoter.</p>

<h3>The Vision</h3>
<p>Tofino is a fast-growing resort community, situated in Tla-o-qui-aht First Nations territory, on the wild west coast of Vancouver Island, BC.  Every year thousands of visitors come to experience the super-natural beauty of this place.</p>
<p>As artists living and working here, we find there are limited options for exhibiting our work and connecting directly with these visitors. </p>
<p>Our vision is a creative space where artists and collectors can connect, and have an authentic art experience.   We believe this will raise the arts and cultural profile of our beloved region, and encourage self-sustainability for local artists.</p>
<p>Your contribution will help us to bring this vision to life.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have been offered a sub-lease on an ideal space, at Industrial Way - a short walk or drive from the heart of 'downtown' Tofino.  Local sculptor and jeweller Jim Schwartz has been using the space as his studio for years.  Now with a juice bar, coffee company and artisan bakery all joining the local brewery bar and other niche food outlets, Industrial Way is one of the fastest-growing new areas of town.  We will need your help to upgrade the space to show and sell the art we will be making there.</p>
<p>We are asking your support to cover some of our start-up costs (based on approx costs/ estimate quotes):</p>
<p>$5000 - Temporary Walls (all materials &amp; construction, including taping &amp; painting)</p>
<p>$2000 - Office Equipment (Laptop, iPad, Telephone, Printer/copier)</p>
<p>$1800 - Track Lighting, Hanging System &amp; Sound System</p>
<p>$2800 - Lease of the space (Deposit + First Month)</p>
<p>$1100 - Security System (Installation + First Month)</p>
<p>$1000 - Insurance</p>
<p>$800 - Licenses, Permits &amp; Memberships (incl: Business, Signage, Chamber of Commerce)</p>
<p>$300 - Advertising (paid ad in summer issue of Preview: Gallery Guide; otherwise utilizing free)</p>
<p>$200 - Point of Sale (POS) System &amp; Internet/Phone deposits</p>
<p>$200 - Furniture (basic office + two cedar benches)</p>
<p>$150 - Website + hosting (3 year term)</p>
<p>= $15,350 approximate Start Up Costs</p>
<p>(If you are able to donate any of these items directly, please contact Andrea Fergusson 250.551.5425 or andreafergusson@gmail.com)</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>You can choose to support our creative vision, by directly donating to this campaign (hit the pink 'Back It' button), or by selecting any of the variety of original art we are offering here.  We deeply appreciate your contribution. </p>
<p>We have secured a $5000 loan from Community Futures; another $10,000 will cover basic start-up costs.  However, if we are able to raise more than this, we can add a wider variety of workshops with a higher calibre of professional artists, make plans for an Arts &amp; Cultural Festival, and be of greater support in our partnering with local non-profit organizations.</p>
<p>If, for some reason, we do not reach our funding goal, we will scale our plans down to accommodate whatever amount we are able to reach.   We can be resourceful, and we will make it work.  However, we truly believe in the power of our vision, and eagerly anticipate the means to make it a reality. </p>

<h3>The Team &amp; The Impact</h3>
<p>Andrea Fergusson came to Tofino almost six years ago, and has lived in Opitsaht (Tla-o-qui-aht village on Meares Island) for the last two.  She has a life-long personal practice making art, as well as experience starting artist groups, working in art galleries, and operating businesses.  An oil painter most often, she also loves drawing, watercolour and pen &amp; ink. As mama to 3 boys, with new baby on the way, she is creating an art haven for herself and fellow artists.</p>
<p>Deanna Lankin is an ocean lover and oil painter, and has exhibited her work in Vancouver and all over Vancouver Island, including two solo exhibitions.  Most recently she exhibited her works at the prestigious Wickaninnish Inn in Tofino.  After completing the Studio Practice and Art Specialist Program at Bealart Institute in Ontario, she was naturally drawn to the West Coast of Canada.  She has since been living in Tofino, British Columbia, where she has been painting professionally since 2005.  <a href=""http://www.deannalankin.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.deannalankin.com</a></p>
<p>Jim Schwartz moved to Tofino in 1976 looking to build his dream studio and live a life close to the ocean. Originally from California, Jim came to Canada to study at the Montreal Museum School of fine art. After a few years Jim came west. It was then that Jim began to carve local types of stone and was awarded with a Canada Council Bursary for this work.

</div></div>","The Vision
Tofino is a fast-growing resort community, situated in Tla-o-qui-aht First Nations territory, on the wild west coast of Vancouver Island, BC.  Every year thousands of visitors come to experience the super-natural beauty of this place.
As artists living and working here, we find there are limited options for exhibiting our work and connecting directly with these visitors. 
Our vision is a creative space where artists and collectors can connect, and have an authentic art experience.   We believe this will raise the arts and cultural profile of our beloved region, and encourage self-sustainability for local artists.
Your contribution will help us to bring this vision to life.

What We Need & What You Get
We have been offered a sub-lease on an ideal space, at Industrial Way - a short walk or drive from the heart of 'downtown' Tofino.  Local sculptor and jeweller Jim Schwartz has been using the space as his studio for years.  Now with a juice bar, coffee company and artisan bakery all joining the local brewery bar and other niche food outlets, Industrial Way is one of the fastest-growing new areas of town.  We will need your help to upgrade the space to show and sell the art we will be making there.
We are asking your support to cover some of our start-up costs (based on approx costs/ estimate quotes):
$5000 - Temporary Walls (all materials & construction, including taping & painting)
$2000 - Office Equipment (Laptop, iPad, Telephone, Printer/copier)
$1800 - Track Lighting, Hanging System & Sound System
$2800 - Lease of the space (Deposit + First Month)
$1100 - Security System (Installation + First Month)
$1000 - Insurance
$800 - Licenses, Permits & Memberships (incl: Business, Signage, Chamber of Commerce)
$300 - Advertising (paid ad in summer issue of Preview: Gallery Guide; otherwise utilizing free)
$200 - Point of Sale (POS) System & Internet/Phone deposits
$200 - Furniture (basic office + two cedar benches)
$150 - Website + hosting (3 year term)
= $15,350 approximate Start Up Costs
(If you are able to donate any of these items directly, please contact Andrea Fergusson 250.551.5425 or andreafergusson@gmail.com)
***
You can choose to support our creative vision, by directly donating to this campaign (hit the pink 'Back It' button), or by selecting any of the variety of original art we are offering here.  We deeply appreciate your contribution. 
We have secured a $5000 loan from Community Futures; another $10,000 will cover basic start-up costs.  However, if we are able to raise more than this, we can add a wider variety of workshops with a higher calibre of professional artists, make plans for an Arts & Cultural Festival, and be of greater support in our partnering with local non-profit organizations.
If, for some reason, we do not reach our funding goal, we will scale our plans down to accommodate whatever amount we are able to reach.   We can be resourceful, and we will make it work.  However, we truly believe in the power of our vision, and eagerly anticipate the means to make it a reality. 

The Team & The Impact
Andrea Fergusson came to Tofino almost six years ago, and has lived in Opitsaht (Tla-o-qui-aht village on Meares Island) for the last two.  She has a life-long personal practice making art, as well as experience starting artist groups, working in art galleries, and operating businesses.  An oil painter most often, she also loves drawing, watercolour and pen & ink. As mama to 3 boys, with new baby on the way, she is creating an art haven for herself and fellow artists.
Deanna Lankin is an ocean lover and oil painter, and has exhibited her work in Vancouver and all over Vancouver Island, including two solo exhibitions.  Most recently she exhibited her works at the prestigious Wickaninnish Inn in Tofino.  After completing the Studio Practice and Art Specialist Program at Bealart Institute in Ontario, she was naturally drawn to the West Coast of Canada.  She has since been living in Tofino, British Columbia, where she has been painting professionally since 2005.  www.deannalankin.com
Jim Schwartz moved to Tofino in 1976 looking to build his dream studio and live a life close to the ocean. Originally from California, Jim came to Canada to study at the Montreal Museum School of fine art. After a few years Jim came west. It was then that Jim began to carve local types of stone and was awarded with a Canada Council Bursary for this work. When Jim moved to Tofino his attentions turned to metallurgy, welding and structural design. Through the 90’s Jim spent a lot of time in Italy studying marble carving and sculpture techniques. Jim has graciously sub-leased his studio at Industrial Way to provide space for Experiential.
As this vision grows we continue to attract artists who wish to work with us.  Experiential is already a synergistic collaboration between local artists and the wider community.

Risks & Challenges
Selling art is an emotionally-driven business.  Traditional, commercial galleries are being replaced by artist-run galleries, artist studios and online art sales.  Education is part of the experience we can offer, for artists and collectors, and contributes to a richer understanding and appreciation for art in our world.
As artists on a journey towards self-sustainability, we have learned to avoid the pitfalls of 'trying to sell art' by simply allowing authentic conversations.  It is this experiential factor which adds that intangible magic to a piece of art. 
Art is not an object, but a doorway.  As artists we are dependable guides.

En lieu avec l’exposition prévu en Novembre, le thème L’Art de se recréer souligne la résilience des êtres et leur capacité à modeler et changer ; un thème porteur d’espoir et d’optimisme de changement.Risques et défisProduire cette exposition est un grand défi, j’y ai déjà investi et confronté les frais d'enregistrement et de production pour assurer que ce projet soit de grande qualité. L'un des défis auxquels je serai confrontés est le timing concernant la coordination de l’exposition et les dates de livraison estimées. Je veux que vous sachiez que mon équipe et moi nous nous assurerons que chaque récompense sera remise en temps et en heure. Je vous tiendrai informé tout au long du processus des updates concernant la livraison des récompenses!Autres façons d'aiderPour ceux qui ne peuvent pas faire une contribution monétaire et souhaitent s'impliquer autrement, il vous suffit de partager cette page avec vos amis sur Facebook, Twitter, et toutes autres plateformes de médias sociaux!Je tiens à remercier d'avance tous mes supporters qui me suivent depuis ces nombreuses années et qui m'ont toujours encouragé à faire ce que je suis. Grâce à votre soutien et votre contribution à cette campagne de sociofinancement, nous ferons de cette exposition un franc succès!",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

I graduated from NYU with a BFA in 2013 and then interned for several months at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice, Italy. Since then I have participated in numerous residencies and exhibitions in California, Mexico, NYC, and Iceland to name a few. 

This past year has been my busiest so far:



The SÍM Residency in Reykjavík, Iceland and corresponding exhibition Gefa & Taka, Give & Take

The Wassaic Artist Residency at the Wassaic Project in Upstate NY and exhibition in The Maxon Mills Gallery
TheAIAR in Guanajuato, Mexico and corresponding exhibition Wrestling Demons

Currently participating in Brooklyn Art Space and Trestle Gallery's Open Studio Residency in Gowanus, BK

2016 has been a whirlwind of creation and growth, and I won't be slowing down anytime soon.
I am very excited for my next opportunity to attend the Vermont Studio Center this upcoming October. During these crucial 4 weeks, I'll be able to completely dive into my studio practice. I will be afforded the chance to experiment and challenge my current process; expand my skill set; work with new, high caliber artists. All and all this is a critical opportunity to grow.

<h3> Who was Maria Sibylla Merian?</h3>
</div>

Maria documented the life cycles of insects in a way that had never been done. Each painting demonstrates the vibrant and active life-cycles of her specimens in their natural habitat. She was a brilliant artist and naturalist whose passion and curiosity predates Darwin by a century and is still admirable today.  We take great honor in this opportunity to work so closely with her texts and to bring her work back 'Off The Page'.   Check out our <a href=""www.meddlingwithnature.com/offthepage"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a> to find out more about the First Lady of Naturalism and be sure to check out the definitive biography <i><a href=""http://www.kimtodd.net/chrysalis__maria_sibylla_merian_and_the_secrets_of_metamorphosis_52898.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chrysalis</a></i> by author <a href=""http://www.kimtodd.net/chrysalis__maria_sibylla_merian_and_the_secrets_of_metamorphosis_52898.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kim Todd</a>, who has been generously helping us unwrap some of the mysteries and adventures that surround Maria.  <div>

<h2>THE IMPACT - 'OFF THE PAGE'</h2>
</div>
<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Exposure.</b> Allowing the original paintings “out of the stacks” to be observed by the
public allows for her work to live on through a modern audience and fulfills
the mandate that Libraries have to both preserve rare books and keep them
relevant to the present.</p>
<p><b>Awareness. </b>By introducing viewers to this work we hope to inspire a new generation of
Naturalists. Through the workshops we will train participants to work within a
naturalist philosophy both responsibly and creatively. </p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Collaboration</b></span>.
This work brings together a large number of arts, sciences, and governmental
institutions. This paves the way for additional collaboration in the future.
The bonds made here will bear fruit for decades to come.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Innovation.</b></span> This is also a project that has not been done before. Recreating illustrations
as sculpture in this manner may become a preferred method for future exhibits
by other institutions. We are paving the way using a new method to look at
scientific illustration. Audubon next?</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Community.</b> We will be utilizing the services of other local artists in the completion of
these works from glass blowing to print making. Support for this project puts
Cincinnati artists to work! </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Conservation. </b><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We are also working with local gardeners and providing sapplings and seeds to those who might like to attract a few butterflies to their own landscape. With the help of entomologists and botanists in Cincinnati we hope to further educate the public about what conservation means and how each individual can take matters into their own hands. </span></p>

<h3><b>Who works with the likes of us? </b></h3>
<p>We
are not novices to Naturalism. We have been presenting work and education related to this topic for 10 years. This is how we
have gained the trust to work with such rare material.  In addition to the
Lloyd, we are in league with the Krohn Conservatory, Cincinnati Zoo, Cincinnati
Museum Center, and the Art Academy of Cincinnati for this project so far. More
to come of course! This to us is a perfect storm of arts and science
institutional cooperation.  With your help, we will be able to purchase the specimens and materials to make this work a reality.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The Completed works will be on exhibition at the Lloyd Library this summer beginning in July. The sculptures that we create as well as preserved and living specimens will be on display alongside the original watercolors of Maria.</span><br/></p>
<p>During the run of this show, we will be doing city wide events that have their central focal point directed at the Lloyd. From brown bag lunches at the Cincinnati Zoo and Museum Center to street level demonstrations downtown and other local libraries and communities. Of course all of that depends on how close we can get to our financial goals.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What happens if we
don’t reach our financial goal?</b></p>
<p>The show must go on! We will produce the pieces we can afford.
If we fall short, we will need to scale some things back and make some
currently planned free events ticketed. Rest assured that contributions you
make will critically matter. We are doing this, but we need your help to make
this as amazing as what we envision. </p>
<p><b>What happens if we exceed
our financial goal?</b></p>
<p>Receiving larger than expected funding will allow us to
scale the show up. There are several plates that we would love to reproduce as
sculpture but require quite a bit more money than what we have allotted currently.
An exceeded funding campaign allows us to complete those pieces. We would also
be able to increase our outreach program and create a number of events for
youth and patrons via summer programs and even school summer programs. </p>

Help us bring to life Maria
Sibylla Merian entomological observations and paintings from the 1700’s as we
replicate her original work as sculpture using real specimens.





  



PROJECT SUMMARY


Considered the First Lady of Naturalism from the 1700's, Maria Sibylla Merian is the perfect example of how closely science and art intertwine.  By supporting this project, you will help Meddling with Nature  take Maria's original early 18th century seminal work on entomology and metamorphosis in Suriname off the page. We will recreate her water color illustrations as sculpture using real insect, animal, and botanical specimens in an exhibition opening at the Lloyd Library & Museum in Cincinnati in July of 2016. This will be an exhibit that allows viewers to ""see what she saw"" and also begin to understand the challenges of documenting nature through illustration. We will present various live specimens, both plant and insect Maria was in contact with along side a wealth of descriptions relating to her work, her life, her challenges, and the state science in the early 18th century. The original books will also be present and opened to key illustrations for everyone to inspect. In addition to replicating Merian's work we plan to include workshops on entomology and plant preservation throughout the exhibit that will follow our ‘see with your own eyes, touch with your own hands’ approach, offering participants the opportunity to utilize the vast treasure trove of experience Maria has made available to us and create their own artistic works inspired by the natural world and Maria.     By making preservation techniques accessible to the public, we hope to inspire participants to study and document the natural world through direct contact while educating the community on the life of such a remarkable woman during a time in which it was extraordinarily difficult for women to gain a foothold in the sciences. 

 Who was Maria Sibylla Merian?


Maria documented the life cycles of insects in a way that had never been done. Each painting demonstrates the vibrant and active life-cycles of her specimens in their natural habitat. She was a brilliant artist and naturalist whose passion and curiosity predates Darwin by a century and is still admirable today.  We take great honor in this opportunity to work so closely with her texts and to bring her work back 'Off The Page'.   Check out our website to find out more about the First Lady of Naturalism and be sure to check out the definitive biography Chrysalis by author Kim Todd, who has been generously helping us unwrap some of the mysteries and adventures that surround Maria.  








Why trust Meddling with Nature?



For ten years, Meddling with Nature has been hard at work advancing the Naturalist Philosophy espoused by explorers and scientists for hundreds of years with workshops on medical illustrations, dissections, medical history, taxidermy, and of course entomology. Meddling with Nature works exclusively with natural cause specimens, giving new meaning to life and death. 

Curious about what we have done in the past?
This sweet little video should serve as a good introduction to our meddling
crew. 





THE IMPACT - 'OFF THE PAGE'




Exposure. Allowing the original paintings “out of the stacks” to be observed by the
public allows for her work to live on through a modern audience and fulfills
the mandate that Libraries have to both preserve rare books and keep them
relevant to the present.
Awareness. By introducing viewers to this work we hope to inspire a new generation of
Naturalists. Through the workshops we will train participants to work within a
naturalist philosophy both responsibly and creatively. 
Collaboration.
This work brings together a large number of arts, sciences, and governmental
institutions. This paves the way for additional collaboration in the future.
The bonds made here will bear fruit for decades to come.
Innovation. This is also a project that has not been done before. Recreating illustrations
as sculpture in this manner may become a preferred method for future exhibits
by other institutions. We are paving the way using a new method to look at
scientific illustration. Audubon next?

Community. We will be utilizing the services of other local artists in the completion of
these works from glass blowing to print making. Support for this project puts
Cincinnati artists to work! 

Conservation. We are also working with local gardeners and providing sapplings and seeds to those who might like to attract a few butterflies to their own landscape. With the help of entomologists and botanists in Cincinnati we hope to further educate the public about what conservation means and how each individual can take matters into their own hands. 


The little moth and lizard in the middle don't match these particular plates but the actual plate specimens have been identified and are available!  Your support of this indiegogo campaign will make recreating these plates a reality. 


Who works with the likes of us? 
We
are not novices to Naturalism. We have been presenting work and education related to this topic for 10 years. This is how we
have gained the trust to work with such rare material.  In addition to the
Lloyd, we are in league with the Krohn Conservatory, Cincinnati Zoo, Cincinnati
Museum Center, and the Art Academy of Cincinnati for this project so far. More
to come of course! This to us is a perfect storm of arts and science
institutional cooperation.  With your help, we will be able to purchase the specimens and materials to make this work a reality.




FAQs regarding our campaign.

When and where will you be able to experience the results of this campaign?
The Completed works will be on exhibition at the Lloyd Library this summer beginning in July. The sculptures that we create as well as preserved and living specimens will be on display alongside the original watercolors of Maria.
During the run of this show, we will be doing city wide events that have their central focal point directed at the Lloyd. From brown bag lunches at the Cincinnati Zoo and Museum Center to street level demonstrations downtown and other local libraries and communities. Of course all of that depends on how close we can get to our financial goals.

What happens if we
don’t reach our financial goal?
The show must go on! We will produce the pieces we can afford.
If we fall short, we will need to scale some things back and make some
currently planned free events ticketed. Rest assured that contributions you
make will critically matter. We are doing this, but we need your help to make
this as amazing as what we envision. 
What happens if we exceed
our financial goal?
Receiving larger than expected funding will allow us to
scale the show up. There are several plates that we would love to reproduce as
sculpture but require quite a bit more money than what we have allotted currently.
An exceeded funding campaign allows us to complete those pieces. We would also
be able to increase our outreach program and create a number of events for
youth and patrons via summer programs and even school summer programs. 

Now who wouldn't want to see this plate come to life!  



  PERKS PERKS AND MORE PERKS



Check out some of our amazing perks and help us bring this world to life! But of course, this wouldn’t be an indigogo campaign without the perks! 
We added a lot of stuff to choose from and we are not at all opposed to
 custom perks. Got an idea? Let’s hear it and make it happen. We have 
access to the original plates from the 1700’s, we are already making 
hi-fidelity scans of absolutely everything.  We also have a number of 
perks that are more event based and a few actually let you give 
positioning your own large insect a try.  Want to come to the exhibit and
 do a still life watercolour painting in much the same way Maria did her
 work? We got you covered. Paint and paper included.

Each issue will likely be made up of 15 contributors, whose contributions may range from a work of writing (poetry, prose, essay, philosophy, scholarship, etc.), a reproduction of a two-dimensional artwork (painting, photography, drawing, architecture, design, etc.), a piece of recorded music, or a work of film.
The hope is that, from however humble a beginning we must start with, we will be able to grow the project and continue to produce an online publication that is supported by the international creative community, therefore not relying upon paid advertising or mainstream trends.
We hope to be able to provide the people who support us with some nifty things, but the real benefit of supporting this publication is, truly, its fruition; and the knowing that you have helped form a new kind of platform for art and writing, the likes of which are few and far between.
 

Risks & Challenges
We know that there's a chance we may not reach our goal through this campaign alone. Although we aren't relying solely on this platform,  we know firsthand that raising money for projects can be slow-going and difficult. Here's some of the other approaches we're taking:

We are also applying to grants and other kinds of funding programs.
We will hold in-person fundraisers and other kinds of events to help us meet our goal.
If we aren't able to reach our goal, we will use whatever funds we do raise as well as our reserve funds to pay as much as we can to our initial contributors, who understand that we might have trouble in these delicate first stages.

We want to make this happen, and will exhaust every method possible to see it to completion.
 

Unable to Contribute Financially?
That is a familiar problem, and is more than okay! We can still use your help getting the word out about this campaign. Here are some other easy ways for you to help us realize this project:

Please send this around to people you think might be interested in supporting!

<p>In the initial stage of<b> </b>DRUNKEN NIGHTS we select 18 artists

If you were part of the literary scene in the Bay Area between 2011 and 2014, you might have seen me read funny, self-deprecating work at Write Club, Quiet Lightning, Velro, Under the Influence, Word Performances, The Worst!, or some other event. You might have heard my pornographic fan fiction read out loud at Shipwreck. More recently, in New York, you might have seen me perform at Cartoon Monsoon, In Search Of..., or Funny/Sexy/Sad. You might have read something I've written on KQEDPop or at The-Tusk.com or somewhere else, or you might have read a piece by someone else that I've edited on The Tusk. You might have seen my artwork in posters for some of these readings, on The Tusk, and elsewhere. You can see all of my published writing and a lot of my drawings and a bunch of videos of me reading my work at <a href=""http://www.natewagg.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.natewagg.com</a>.</p>
<p>I'm trying to go on a short, cross-country reading tour. I will be reading in Los Angeles during the Association of Writers and Writing Programs convention, then in San Francisco, then at Song Missing in Atlanta, then in Richmond. Here is the full schedule of confirmed events:</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Highland Park Babylon at Bookshow LA: April 2</span><br/></p>
<p>Funny/Sexy/Sad at Second Act in SF: April 4</p>
<p>Song Missing in Atlanta: April 6</p>
<p>I've Got a Message for King Wizard, Son of a Heartless Manipulator, but He's in the Yukon, Chop Suey Books in Richmond, VA, April 9</p>
<p>Funny/Sexy/Sad in Brooklyn: April 14</p>
<p>The point of this will be to continue garnering the small following I've accrued doing readings in different parts of the United States, as well as to promote The Tusk and to promote a book I recently put out though a small small press called Snow Goose, ""Dilettantes and Heartless Manipulators."" </p>
<p>Joining me to read at these events will be such luminaries as Lizzy Acker (Monster Party, KQED, Willamette Week), Tom Batten (The Guardian), Lauren O'Neal (Slate, The Hairpin), Maggie Tokuda-Hall (Shipwreck, Midnight Breakfast), Casey Childers (Shipwreck, Write Club), and Andrew Blossom (Makeout Creek, I've Got A Message For You and You're Not Going to Like It). So in a way it's also about community-- all of us deserve greater recognition, these events bring people together, foster dialogue and creativity and so on.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I need money to eat, miss work, get a bus from LA to SF, rent a car to travel from Atlanta to Richmond, put gas in the rental car, get a hotel in Atlanta, probably take some cabs, and take the train back home from Richmond to New York. </p>
<p>For donating, depending on how much you donate, you can get a copy of the book, a bunch of art I've done printed out together in a little collection, some original art, some art on commission i.e. you tell me what to draw or write, and I'm also selling a guest post on The Tusk (the site gets ~10,000 hits per month), as long as you don't write something racist or slanderous or whatever on there.</p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>I could be murdered by some maniac at literally any point on this trip. It's possible that no one will show up to any of these readings, that everyone has always just been humoring me, and now is the point at which they all just unanimously go, ""You know what? Fuck that guy. We shouldn't support his awful nonsense anymore."" I could get ripped up and chewed up and booed offstage. There's vomit on my sweater already, Mom's spaghetti.</p>

The point of this will be to continue garnering the small following I've accrued doing readings in different parts of the United States, as well as to promote The Tusk and to promote a book I recently put out though a small small press called Snow Goose, ""Dilettantes and Heartless Manipulators."" 
Joining me to read at these events will be such luminaries as Lizzy Acker (Monster Party, KQED, Willamette Week), Tom Batten (The Guardian), Lauren O'Neal (Slate, The Hairpin), Maggie Tokuda-Hall (Shipwreck, Midnight Breakfast), Casey Childers (Shipwreck, Write Club), and Andrew Blossom (Makeout Creek, I've Got A Message For You and You're Not Going to Like It). So in a way it's also about community-- all of us deserve greater recognition, these events bring people together, foster dialogue and creativity and so on.   What I Need & What You Get I need money to eat, miss work, get a bus from LA to SF, rent a car to travel from Atlanta to Richmond, put gas in the rental car, get a hotel in Atlanta, probably take some cabs, and take the train back home from Richmond to New York. 
For donating, depending on how much you donate, you can get a copy of the book, a bunch of art I've done printed out together in a little collection, some original art, some art on commission i.e. you tell me what to draw or write, and I'm also selling a guest post on The Tusk (the site gets ~10,000 hits per month), as long as you don't write something racist or slanderous or whatever on there.

    Risks & Challenges I could be murdered by some maniac at literally any point on this trip. It's possible that no one will show up to any of these readings, that everyone has always just been humoring me, and now is the point at which they all just unanimously go, ""You know what? Fuck that guy. We shouldn't support his awful nonsense anymore."" I could get ripped up and chewed up and booed offstage. There's vomit on my sweater already, Mom's spaghetti.
    Other Ways You Can Help Share this thing. Come to the readings. Please come to the readings!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Jadon is experiencing seismic shifts in his young life. He has given seven long years to chasing his dreams of becoming an artist of renown in New York City.

The prospect of success is thrilling and terrifying. Jadon leans on his small circle of friends to prepare himself for the leap. They are fellow artists, muses and crushes.

<p><b>About me and my art</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>My name is Gábor Urbán,
I am a painter born in the former Yugoslavia. In the early nineties I
denied to participate in the Balkan war, so I had to leave my
country. I moved to Hungary, later I lived and worked on the island
of Hvar, Croatia. Currently I live alternately in Hungary and Serbia.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>One of my motto is from
Apelles: ”Nulla dies sine linea”- “No day without a line”,
what means that not a single day can pass idly, without a
brush-stroke. I am working continuously for more than five decades,
choosing painting as
a profession and a way of life.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Description of Need </b>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>As a professional painter
I either work on completing my artistic vision, articulating my
thoughts and feelings in the form of paintings; or I merely paint
paintings that can be sold easily to cover my everyday expenses –
and this distracts me from expressing my real artistic vision. My
more significant works which are coming from my real passion and love
for painting are expressions of a spiritual adventure, a magical realistic
vision about the destiny of humanity.</p>
<p>To focus on my artistic
duty I need my financial situation to be secured at least for a year,
so that I can finish 5-8 of my most significant unfinished paintings,
that would complete my life work.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>My goal</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Next year I will reach the
age of 70 and my health condition is worsening which decreases my
working capacity. I feel a pressing urge to use my remaining time and
energy to concentrate on completing my artistic life work instead of
wasting my time and talent for pieces of smaller significance
produced mainly for sale.</p>
<p>My goal is to finish 5-8 paintings in one years period of time.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>How You Can Help</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>10
000 USD would be enough
for a
year to cover my modest
expenses for
basic and essential
things that
are necessary to maintain
painting and living (food, paint, accommodation, bills).</p>
<p>With your donations you
would support me to create with free spirit and  dedicate all my time
and efforts to my unfinished pieces without existential fear and
constraints to fulfill my artistic mission, my destiny and duty in
this world.</p>

completed several mentorships in the last two semesters in Butoh dance,
installation, movement and indigenous costume/ritual. This movement performance
within an installation will be very intimate, ritualistic and interactive. I
need help with covering my huge list of materials, as this installation is
large and immersive and the costumes involve a LOT of yarn. The materials for
bamboo jellyfish, a water wall, coffin cribs and a pillow net aren't
necessarily cheap (in addition to chairs, lighting and floor matting), though I
am trying to use a lot of recycled materials. The project is, simply put,
large.  I want to have the performance in a nice venue and I’ll be needing
rehearsal space, which I hope to acquire cheaply, but those can be major costs.
I would also like to give something to those who help with the performance and
installation--fellow performer, sound track artist, filming, door, lights, etc.
This program is pricey and my student loans don't cover my living expenses, let

<h3><b>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</b></h3>Risks: <br/><br/>Having too much fun, running out of hairspray, summoning a mystical creature from another dimension.<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p>Challenges: <br/></p>
<p>MOOP. Many of our materials are salvaged and natural, which creates a risk for Matter Out Of Place. To address this we will seal all fragile materials with lacquer and/or resin.<br/><br/>This is an old vehicle, old parts sometimes break. We have a rebuilt engine, a recently refurbished brake system, and have had the running gear professionally inspected before our adventure to Black Rock City!<br/><br/>Being an old bus with a top speed of 50 MPH, the  325-mile journey to BRC is especially daunting. We are going to hire a professional shipping company to haul the Bonerpillar to and from BRC.<br/><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3 align=""center"" style=""text-align: left;""><span><b>THE BUILDERS</b></span></h3>
<p><span>Based in Oregon and California, a group of dedicated veteran burners have come together to bring the Bonerpillar vision to the playa. We are co-conspiring to manifest this gift of rock'n'roll in caterpillar form to give back to Black ROCK City. Each contributor has their own journey of connection, transformation and ass-slapping good times that they have personally been gifted with from the dusty depths of the Burning Man community. And now it's time to return the favor in the form of a mind-blowing, face-melting experience. <br/></span></p>
<p>Let's get dusty!</p>

</div></div>","After conceptualizing,
scheming, and plotting for years, we are finally ready to introduce you to the mythical
creature from another dimension that will be bringing Rock'n'Roll to Black ROCK City. 


Meet The Bonerpillar



A 30-foot fire-shooting caterpillar made out of bones and YOU can ride it. All aboard for this Rock'n'Roll odyssey through Black Rock City!

Transformed from a Ford 66 Straight Six short bus, the Bonerpillar is an Art Car with attitude. 

The bus will be buried beneath layers of mutation, starting with a steel frame that safely supports the upper observation deck and the extended back deck. Layers of laser-cut and painted plywood will create the exoskeleton, adorned in bones and weird crap, with ribs protruding from each side.



About those bones...
Both literally and
figuratively, we're talking real bones, things that look like bones, scrap metal, drift and
salvaged wood... dead things. The skeletons of our cultural and industrial landscape.
Re-purposed, re-imagined, RESURRECTED. 










WHY WE NEED YOUR HELP

An art project of this magnitude can be quite expensive. The Bonerpillar is more than 75% funded by the artists and our support team of builders,welders, engineers, burners and Rock'n'Rollers. With your help, we will be able to cover the remaining costs and conjure up this mutant caterpillar creature to bring Rock'n'Roll glory to the citizens of Black ROCK City!

What your donations will help us buy:

Flame Effects 

Two flame poofers affixed to the head that will serve as fiery antennas leading our little mutant as it crawls through the darkest of playa nights, complete with fittings, tanks, and fuel.
Gimme fuel, gimme fire, gimme that which I desire! 
Lights 
The lighting will be a combination of stage lighting and programmable LED's. 
Our crew is working hard on the design to keep our little creature brilliantly blazing through the night!
Sound
What's the Bonerpillar without Rock'n'Roll? We need a high-power sound system that can crank out those guitar solos and keep us rockin' all over the playa!


Additional funds raised beyond our goal will be used for the following:Upgrade Flame EffectsIf we exceed our funding goal of $6666, we will add MORE FIRE!!! More fire means more awesome.Additional Materials for Mutation  
The frame, exoskeleton, ribs and face are all fabricated by our team of artists. Additional materials such as metal, plywood, bones, cushions, and  paint, can help us take the Bonerpillar to the next level.



RISKS AND CHALLENGESRisks: Having too much fun, running out of hairspray, summoning a mystical creature from another dimension.
Challenges: 
MOOP. Many of our materials are salvaged and natural, which creates a risk for Matter Out Of Place. To address this we will seal all fragile materials with lacquer and/or resin.This is an old vehicle, old parts sometimes break. We have a rebuilt engine, a recently refurbished brake system, and have had the running gear professionally inspected before our adventure to Black Rock City!Being an old bus with a top speed of 50 MPH, the  325-mile journey to BRC is especially daunting. We are going to hire a professional shipping company to haul the Bonerpillar to and from BRC.


THE BUILDERS
Based in Oregon and California, a group of dedicated veteran burners have come together to bring the Bonerpillar vision to the playa. We are co-conspiring to manifest this gift of rock'n'roll in caterpillar form to give back to Black ROCK City. Each contributor has their own journey of connection, transformation and ass-slapping good times that they have personally been gifted with from the dusty depths of the Burning Man community. And now it's time to return the favor in the form of a mind-blowing, face-melting experience. 
Let's get dusty!




HOW ELSE YOU CAN HELP
As a community project based in the atmosphere of gifting, we are encouraging donations of resources!

We're looking for more materials, especially electric guitars and 
bones. We also need: Plywood, lumber, steel stock, propane cylinders and
 more.

We are hosting work parties throughout the summer. If you live 
close and want to be part of the Bonerpillar Erectors, come on down to 
help! 
The best thing you can do for us if you like the Bonerpillar: Share!
 Tell a friend, tell your mom, tell your mom's friend. Share our project
 on your Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and in your community. We look forward to hearing from you!

<li>Q: How does Artrvl process payment?<br/>A: Our payment system is designed to make transferring money between creators and hosts as simple and reliable as possible. Here’s how it works:<br/>1. Once a gig is confirmed between both parties, host prepays Artrvl to lock the deal.<br/>2.

FAQ


Q: What if I can’t provide accommodation, food or transportation, can I still invite artists?A: Yes, the options are mandatory, but you have the choice to give cash instead, which equals the local mid-range living standard. 
Q: How many countries can I travel to through Artrvl?A: Artrvl support all creative activity and traveling in all countries, some countries requires visas, guides or convoy, you can refer to nomadlist.com or loneyplanet.com to check essential travels information, cost of living, best time to go, time zone, weather, traffic, food, visa, health & safety & insurance and the likes.
Q: How can Artrvl ensure my safety?A: We have a function to let everyone verify themselves by linking their passport and credit card to their profile, we won’t store any information or charge anything meanwhile we make sure everyone’s account is linked to their social network, You can get to know the hosts and creators through their profile, comments and their ratings from previous gigs, use our messaging feature to message the other party any questions and get to know them better.
Q: How is the offer determined for my invitation?A: cost of accommodation, cost of food, cost of local transportation, these are determined by algorithm and are automatically calculated once you fill in your gig information. Artrvl only charges a service fee when your gig is confirmed. Of course the more you offer, the more likely your gig would attract more talented people.
Q: How does Artrvl process payment?A: Our payment system is designed to make transferring money between creators and hosts as simple and reliable as possible. Here’s how it works:1. Once a gig is confirmed between both parties, host prepays Artrvl to lock the deal.2. Our punishment towards cancelation is strict, this way we will keep Artrvl community healthy and responsible.3. Once a gig is accomplished and reviewed, if cash is involved, the funds will automatically go to creators’ account.
Q: What’s Artrvl’s cancelation rules? If I get invited for a gig and the other person cancels it at last minute?A: If you cancel a gig at least 48 hours before it starts, you will get refunded except the service fee; If your cancel a gig less than 48 hours, then it’s nun-refundable. If you are a creator and cancel a gig less than 48 hours, your rating will drop by one star which will affect your future invitation.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">A PERFORMANCE CYCLE</h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">BY JAAMIL OLAWALE KOSOKO</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Jaamil Olawale Kosoko. I am an American artist and curator working internationally on creative projects that relate to spirituality, identity, and body based performance. I am a 2017 Princeton Arts Fellow and Lecturer, a 2017 Jerome Artists in Residence at Abrons Arts Center, a 2017 APAP Leadership Fellow, and a 2017 Cave Canem Poetry Fellow. </p>
<p>I am raising money to close the funding gap of a multi-tiered series of interdisciplinary projects launching this year. With your support, over the next several months my team and I will: </p>
<ul>
<li>premiere the new short film: WHITE STATE | BLACK MIND, The Making of #negrophobia</li>
<li>record a series of new and selected poems. </li>
<li>publish the essay WHITE STATE | BLACK MIND</li>
<li>conduct a series of international creative residencies in Pennsylvania, Belgium, Munich, Vermont, and NYC. </li>
<li>create and present the World Premiere of the new live performance, SÉANCERS opening in Dec. 6-9, 2017 in NYC.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>My work attempts to make plain often invisible systems of power, assumptions and cultural categories through abstract, oblique, and alternative readings of society. </p>
<p>Questions will include asking how we engage choreographic structures that resist determining who we think others are, and how we expand the notion (offer more context or framing) of the 'blink', the 'gaze', 'perception' of self in relation to others.

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need to raise $5000 to support artist and material fees related to producing these events. All proceeds go to paying my awesome team of designers and performers.

<h3>WHAT IS BEYOND THE SURFACE?</h3>
<p>We were attracted to the idea of portals that exist in our everyday lives.  Infinity mirrors open the gates into such portals.  These mirrors reflect the infinite depths of our souls, and these portals act as visual gateways into those depths.</p>
<p>Burning Man is the stage, the desert the backdrop, and the infinity mirror is the doorway for our subconscious to liberate themselves from each of us.  In this way, we can see beyond the surface and unveil the truth in this world...</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>WHO ARE WE?</h3>
<p>Zac, Phil, and James for starters. The three of us have combined experience in large-scale installations, architecture, programming, and engineering. We are currently pursuing Master's degrees in Integrated Product Design at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>HOW WILL WE DO IT?</h3>
<p>Beyond The Surface is an immersive room where every wall and ceiling is filled with infinity mirrors. What is an infinity mirror, you ask? Here is one:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/FPjpQqpplYLrG/giphy.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We will have 150 of these babies, so get pumped up!</p>
<p>There will be a number of lighting effects that will be activated by human interaction. We have built loads of prototypes to see what is possible and how radical we can make them.</p>
<p>Here are a couple pieces we placed around the UPenn campus:</p>

<p>As you can probably assume, the pieces above are made with static LEDs. HOWEVER, Beyond The Surface will have some more riveting effects that we have prototyped below:</p>

<h3>NOW, WHY WOULD YOU HELP US?</h3>
<p>As we mentioned, we are looking to raise $10,000 to make this gem sparkle like a clear summer's night. We want to create a memorable experience for people and really open their imaginations to how you can interact with technology to create something inspiring. Let's give ya the breakdown:</p>

<h3>STRETCHHHHHH GOALS!</h3>
<p>Our current design of Beyond The Surface is going to be pretty dang neat. However, if we happen to raise more money than our goal, we have a few snazzy items in mind to add to the installation:</p>
<p>$15,000 -&gt; If we hit this target, we will add a fully reflective floor to Beyond The Surface, adding another element of infinite illumination.</p>
<p>$17,500 -&gt; If we hit this target, we will add speakers that will project sound programmed to compliment the lighting effects within the room.</p>
<p>$20,000 -&gt; If we manage to really surprise the s*** out of ourselves and hit this, we will add all of the components above, PLUS infinity themed furniture within the space where burners can lounge and enjoy the show.</p>

<p>As mentioned previously, the three of us have extensive experience in large-scale manufacturing, as well as project management. Additionally, our team has calculated for mishaps and troubleshooting as to mitigate any delays in the production of Beyond The Surface.

<p>I'm interested in how technology and design can create memorable experiences.  Burning Man has given me the opportunity to explore this further with Beyond the Surface.   A former architectural designer and now a product designer, I enjoy designing and building things at all scales.  Never one to shy away from learning new things, I've lately been exploring developing firmware for consumer electronics, creative coding, and learning the blues on the harmonica.  Please don't ask me to perform....yet.</p>

As mentioned previously, the three of us have extensive experience in large-scale manufacturing, as well as project management. Additionally, our team has calculated for mishaps and troubleshooting as to mitigate any delays in the production of Beyond The Surface. We are confident we will complete construction and testing by August 15th, allowing us extra time to play with lighting effects and ensure proper functionality.
 

THE RADICAL TEAM!
 

Zac Bensing
I love building trippy stuff. I'm formally trained as a mechanical engineer, yet passionately trained as an artist of many mediums. Creating an installation for Burning Man has been a dream of mine for years and being able to watch this piece bring enjoyment to others is going to be the reward I look forward to most. Let's get wild, peace!
 
Phil Chang
I'm interested in how technology and design can create memorable experiences.  Burning Man has given me the opportunity to explore this further with Beyond the Surface.   A former architectural designer and now a product designer, I enjoy designing and building things at all scales.  Never one to shy away from learning new things, I've lately been exploring developing firmware for consumer electronics, creative coding, and learning the blues on the harmonica.  Please don't ask me to perform....yet.

James Sannino
I'm an MIT nerd turned technologist/designer based in Philly. I've been creating interactive installations for art and science for 7 years in the museum world. I'm gonna blow your pixelated mind with infinite recursion!

Manifestations contre l’avortement, recrudescences des agressions homo et transphobe, inégalités salariales entre les hommes et les femmes, manifestation d’hostilité envers les réfugiés de guerre, les exemples sont si nombreux qu’une page ne saurait tous les répertorier. Notre écosystème lui même est désormais tellement menacé par l’activité humaine, que cette dernière décennie a vu l’émergence d’un nouvel exercice transdisciplinaire étudiant l’effondrement de notre civilisation : la collapsologie.</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">C’est un monde de paradoxe, ou le mal être généralisé s’exprime souvent violemment, notamment au travers des replis identitaires des nations. En France, le rassemblement national obtient toujours davantage de voix, mais nous pouvons constater cette tendance dans de nombreuses autres nations (Etats-unis, Royaume-uni, Brésil, Turquie pour en citer quelques uns. Un monde de paradoxe car, parallèlement à la déréliction des populations et à la destruction de notre planète, se dresse les multinationales toutes puissantes et leur dictature du bonheur, de l’esthétisation à outrance, du divertissement de masse et de l’ hyperconsommation.

S’inscrivant dans mon projet de recherche en création contemporaine, elle regroupe un ensemble de 20 photographies sur fer brut dont voici quelques exemples.My plastic research intend to go beyond the image in photography in order to crystallize the interactions that constitute our identity, our environment and our notion of reality.For interested readers, my research problem in contemporary creation is at the bottom of this page (in French).In order to present you my project, it is necessary to me to return on a previous series ""Paquare"".https://www.sc-camors.com/paquare-metalCompleted in 2016, after an environmental protection volunteering trip in Costa Rica. As part of my research project in contemporary creation, it includes a set of 20 photographs on raw iron, here are some examples. De part sa composition, l’œuvre est donc sujette à l’oxydation et sans précaution de conservation l’oeuvre entamera un lent processus de détérioration jusqu’à son irrémédiable disparition, créant ainsi un effet miroir avec notre environnement menacé qui plus que jamais nécessite que nous changions nos comportementsLe très bon accueil qu’à reçu cette série auprès d’institutions publiques et privées (je remercie d’ailleurs la Galerie Agama, Toulouse université, le Quai des Savoirs et le HDLU muséum de Zagreb) m’a permis de rencontrer de nombreu.se.x visiteurs afin de les sensibiliser à mon projets et aux enjeux me tenant à cœur.Encouragée par les retours positifs, je souhaite poursuivre mes travaux dans d’autres environnements menacés par l’activité humaine et l’Arctique en tant que lieu emblématique des effets néfastes du réchauffement climatique est une destination toute indiquée.Outre la production d’une nouvelle série de photographie sur fer brut « AASIAAT », cette résidence sera l’occasion d’un partage avec la population locale, me permettant d’animer des ateliers artistiques mais surtout d’appréhender les problématiques environnementales des hommes et femmes pour qui le réchauffement climatique est vécu au quotidien.Due to its composition, the work is therefore subject to oxidation and without precaution of conservation the work will begin a slow process of deterioration until its irremediable disappearance, thus  a mirror effect is created with our threatened environment that more than ever requires that we change our behaviors.The very good reception of this series from public and private institutions (I thank the Agama Gallery, Toulouse University, the Quai des Savoirs and the HDLU Museum Zagreb) allowed me to meet many visitors to make them aware of my projects and issues that are important to me.Encouraged by the positive feedbacks, I wish to continue my work in other environments threatened by human activity and the Arctic as an emblematic place of the harmful effects of global warming is a perfect destination.In addition to the production of a new series of photography on raw iron ""AASIAAT"", this residence will be an opportunity to share with the local population, allowing me to lead artistic workshops but especially to understand the environmental issues of men and women for whom global warming is lived every day. LE FINANCEMENT :Le montant sollicité ne couvrant que la moitié de la participation aux frais de vie à bord du Manguier (2500€), du transport (1500€) et de l’achat d’équipement adapté au grand froid (500€), n’hésitez pas à me soutenir une fois le but atteint.Cette campagne n’est pas sur le mode de financement « tout ou rien », ainsi vous recevrez votre contrepartie même si elle n’atteint pas la somme requise.Chaque contribution, même modeste, compte énormément pour moi …N'hésitez pas à partager cette campagne ! ;)The requested amount  covering only the half of  the participation in living expenses aboard the Manguier (2500 €), the transportation (1500 €) and the purchase of equipment adapted to the cold (500 €), don't hesitate to support me once the goal is reached.This campaign is not in the ""all-or-nothing"" mode, so you will receive your perks even if it does not reach the required amount.Every contribution, however modest, counts enormously for me ...Feel free to share this campaign! ;)LES CONTREPARTIES :J’aurais souhaité pouvoir vous tenir informé en temps réel, vous distiller en direct un peu de cette aventure boréale, mais nos conditions de vie rendrons l'accès à internet peu fréquent et surtout en débit très réduit. Cependant, si cela m’est techniquement possible je vous enverrai le plus régulièrement possible des nouvelles de ce périple.Je propose en contrepartie de votre soutient les fruits de ma résidence. Celle ci ayant lieu du 2 au 30 avril 2019 il ne me sera pas possible de vous les présenter avant la fin de la campagne.C’est donc une contrepartie « à l’aveugle », mais pour chaque tirage je vous ferai parvenir au préalable un catalogue numérique vous permettant de choisir votre photographie.Vous pouvez cependant voir ma série ""Paquare"" ici: https://www.sc-camors.com/paquare-metalI propose in return for your support the production done during this residence. it takes place from April the 2th to the 30th 2019, thus it will not be possible for me to present  you before my work he end of the campaign.It is therefore a  ""blind"" perks, but for each print I will send you before a digital catalog allowing you to choose your photograph.You can however see my series ""Paquare"" here: https://www.sc-camors.com/paquare-metalDERNIÈRES NOUVELLES :Parce que la médiatisation est toujours importante voici les dernières nouvelles de « Paquare » qui semblent être de bonnes augures pour AASIAAT :- Chronique dans le numéro 87 fev/mars 2019 d’Aesthetica https://issuu.com/aesthetica_magazine/docs/e-issue_87___issuu?e=5376688%2F67404697&fbclid=IwAR3XfykXvd58KsplwzP6jZjKF3L7iGP2ogH8xC_tCGiqPUzf6ZgPI1r23Dg-  Finaliste du YICCA International contest of contemporary Art MERCI A TOUS ! PS : LA RECHERCHE EN CRÉATION CONTEMPORAINE : Comme promis, pour ceux qui souhaitent un peu de lecture, voici plus de détail sur ma problématique de recherche. Avant propos :Nous vivons dans une société où les inégalités font rages et où les droits les plus élémentaires sont constamment remis en question, voir bafoués. Manifestations contre l’avortement, recrudescences des agressions homo et transphobe, inégalités salariales entre les hommes et les femmes, manifestation d’hostilité envers les réfugiés de guerre, les exemples sont si nombreux qu’une page ne saurait tous les répertorier. Notre écosystème lui même est désormais tellement menacé par l’activité humaine, que cette dernière décennie a vu l’émergence d’un nouvel exercice transdisciplinaire étudiant l’effondrement de notre civilisation : la collapsologie.C’est un monde de paradoxe, ou le mal être généralisé s’exprime souvent violemment, notamment au travers des replis identitaires des nations. En France, le rassemblement national obtient toujours davantage de voix, mais nous pouvons constater cette tendance dans de nombreuses autres nations (Etats-unis, Royaume-uni, Brésil, Turquie pour en citer quelques uns. Un monde de paradoxe car, parallèlement à la déréliction des populations et à la destruction de notre planète, se dresse les multinationales toutes puissantes et leur dictature du bonheur, de l’esthétisation à outrance, du divertissement de masse et de l’ hyperconsommation. Le capitalisme cognitif ou capitalisme artiste colonise jusqu’à la moindre parcelle de temps de cerveau disponible, tentant de transformer sans vergogne nos neurones en part de marché.C’est l’ère de l’économie libidinale qui, comme l’explique Bernard Stiegler, organise et produit du désir en détruisant la conscience, induisant ainsi une destruction du désir.

<p>SL stands for <a href=""www.sematsatsalibrary.co.za"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Sematsatsa Library</i></a>, a name that is in many ways has worked and in others has not worked. </p>
<p>People often ask me how did I come up with the name and what prompted me to actually call my social enterprise, <i>Sematsatsa Library</i>. The answer is simple. I grew up in a nuclear family, as an only child with my civil servant mum and my teacher dad however, the people I was  mostly surrounded by were women,who in essence in my side of the woods would be called, ""Sematsatsa"".

SL stands for Sematsatsa Library, a name that is in many ways has worked and in others has not worked. 
People often ask me how did I come up with the name and what prompted me to actually call my social enterprise, Sematsatsa Library. The answer is simple. I grew up in a nuclear family, as an only child with my civil servant mum and my teacher dad however, the people I was  mostly surrounded by were women,who in essence in my side of the woods would be called, ""Sematsatsa"". Till now, the word just stuck with me. 
Later, as I grew older, when the time came to come up with the name, I bound Sematsatsa with a place, positioned in my memory, as a happy place, with the word, Library. And so, this journey has been quite nostalgic in remembering the two spaces and places that encouraged me to express myself, unapologetically and unafraid.  
Therefore the SL Journal  is a space I hope many women will share with each other as well as about each other's work.  With the intent to  document and contribute to the discourse of black voices in the Visual Arts sector, to understand the role of the female artists in relation to the socio -political landscape of Post – Apartheid South Africa as well as explore through conversation and writing the practise of collaboration between  black female artists.   In this first edition of the SL Journal, a lot of work and cooperation has been given and so far, in kind. 
We have worked with many women, as well as men, along the way who have made sure, we have the full support  however we need to step up to the plate to producing a fully fledged publication. 
HOW MUCH DO WE NEED? 
We have determined that to put a journal of this importance in the wake of the discourse of African women's narratives and lives, we'd need an amount of R25 000 as a start.
Together with your contribution, we will be able to commission the women we have started the process with (pictured in our campaign header) on our first edition.  
WHY DO WE DO WHAT WE DO?
The SL Journal has been an idea carried in many ways through the different events that we have hosted as a social business, both online and offline. This time, the premise is motivated with collaboration as our ingredient to a successful literary signifier for women of colour to engage with on a material, creative as well as intellectual level.  
In the past, we have collaborated and co - hosted events with amazing artists specifically writers and by our nature, on women. 
Our most recent event  in Johannesburg at the Visual Arts Network of South Africa, we collaborated with writer and Arts & Culture Editor of Africa is a Country, Neelika. M. Jayawardane  to start a conversation than set the agenda on it. We hope to expand on the sentiments shared during the event with this particular project.  We are fortunate to have her as one of our patrons and contributors to the project. 
HOW CAN YOU HELP US GET THERE?
The SL Journal​ is aimed at starting the conversation on many topics however we cannot do it without the assistance in different forms. These topics involve telling stories that will encourage us, to collectively write the narrative, right. To write the story in total intimacy with our own ideas. 
In most cases, finance is needed to maintain a platform and with finance, many eyes and hands are able to make a creative output that we all can be proud of.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Paula Neves, writer and director of True Colors. I'm graduated in Film and I believe that movies were meant to represent us and/or the society we live or once lived in. I also believe people have colors.</p>
<p>""Synesthesia is a neurological phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second sensory or cognitive pathway""[Wikipedia].</p>
<p>Can you imagine the taste of your favorite song? The smell of a word? Seeing color in words and letters? That is the case for our lead character, Artur, who has seen shades of orange in everyone around him. Until he meets Lunne. Weird name, weird clothes and shades of blue.</p>
<p>Our goal is to tell a story through the POV of a person with synesthesia. This perspective of story-telling creates a new challenge and edge to the filmmaking process. Taking the simplest experiences and conversations that we have day to day and putting them in the perspective of a synesthetic individual adds a new dimension both visually and audibly.</p>
<p>For some, that means representation. And for others a brand new thing.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Support! As you know, the art of filmmaking comes with a cost. We are aiming for a no frills shoot. With the money that we fund, we will us it towards;</p>
<p>- Production Insurance: This ensures that our cast, crew, and equipment is safe. </p>
<p>- Catering and Craft Services:  A safe, productive, and happy crew is a <i>well fed </i>crew.</p>
<p>- Locations: We have two locations in the script; a coffee shop and a book store. We need each location for one day. (If you know of anyone in the greater LA area that owns a location and would be willing to donate it to us, please let us know! It'd be greatly appreciated.)</p>
<p>- Gear Rentals: Because our short is being told through the 'lens' of an individual with an exceptional perspective, we are looking to rent some special equipment to best portray this experience. This includes camera and additional lenses.</p>
<p>- Additional Expenses: hard drives, expendables, transportation costs for cast, crew, and equipment.</p>
<h3>What Do YOU Get</h3>
<p>In addition to the opportunity to get to know more about these amazing people and watching an artistic love story, you will also have access a short documentary and production BTS.</p>
<p>Yeah. You read it right: <strong>A short documentary.</strong></p>
<p>We’ll have a 2nd unit on set covering behind the scenes and interviews with cast and crew. Plus full research and interview with synesthete people and their art.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Synesthesia for some people can mean their whole life, for others is a brand new word and concept.  1 out of 2000 people have synesthesia. One third of them don’t know about it. Feeling represented and connected on the big screen is a reason we make films. </p>
<p><i>True Colors</i> goal is to have the audience participate actively in this process. To experience the world and the story in an interesting way. We want the audience to fill in the blanks and notice their own senses being triggered or ignored that usually come without thought.</p>
<p>With the film and the documentary, we most of all want to bring awareness.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Social media! Share this project with your friends, family, and co-workers!  Let’s fund a beautiful and engaging story of two complete strangers with different colors.</p>

<p>Our web series, <i><b>Siren Call</b></i>, has two great things going for us
right now: a beautiful location in a house on Shelter Island which connects to
a beach, and five stories that take a fresh, feminist approach to the classic
construct of the Siren. The first season is a seed that we hope will foster
more episodes shot around New York’s many waterfronts. We hope to showcase the
many actors, writers and directors within our network and continue this
poignant series showing three dimensional female characters dealing with supernatural
elements that feel mighty yet reminiscent of real life.</p>

theater: <i>“</i>Only 22% of produced plays are written by women.  If life worked like the theater, four out of

Nevertheless, we believe that the friends of WE WIN, Ordway, Sounds of Blackness, Thomasina Petrus, Tonia Hughes, Black Storytelling Alliance, Voice of Culture, Longshot, Tamiko French, and T Mychael Rambo are our greatest partners. In other words, we know you got our backs!
Thank you for your support, and please help us to spread the word about this campaign to bring Kwanzaa: 20 Years of Excellence to the Ordway! 


About WE WIN Institute
WE WIN Institute (WE WIN) is a nonprofit, community-based organization dedicated to the mission of creating academic and social success for all children. WE WIN provides a safe and nurturing environment for young people and works to increase parental involvement in the lives of their children and in their child’s schools. WE WIN gives children a base of knowledge in core subjects and assists them in developing the skills that they need to grow into successful and responsible adults. Our programs are focused on giving youth and families tools to create long-term and systemic change in their lives and communities. WE WIN’s program goals are centered on challenging young people to reach their highest potential. We strive to ensure the youth involved in our programs, many of whom are not typically involved in out-of-school time programming, make their communities brighter for the future. Through literacy, mentoring, and educational activities WE WIN strives to achieve these goals:

Support the academic, social, emotional, and physical growth of youth participants.
Develop the leadership skills of youth through active involvement in WE WIN’s curriculum and through contributions to the community.
Provide youth with academic and life readiness skills that help youth succeed in school and in life.

Learning how to draw and paint is the first step toward a lifetime of creativity.
Quality drawing and painting along with fine art instruction enhances academic success and instills the self-confidence needed in future endeavors.

Or to put it in other words – an interdisciplinary intellectual circle for creating temporary virtual marvelous worlds. A platform for realizing them. A workshop for vitalizing ideo-spiritual attunements in art and culture, such as romanticism and magical realism. An outdoorsy artistic practical, a festival, an educational method and a celebration of creativity – this is what our yearly events combine and interlace within themselves. ThursdaySquareCircle is the conceptual laboratory which projects these happenings, the main purpose of which is to transform and transmute their immediate surroundings in accordance with the perspectives of the ideo-spiritual attitude being explored.           <br/>                What are the origins of ThursdaySquareCircle? Heaps of reading, generous assistance from the mycelium of inspiration, the unfailing support of Monsieur Thursday (the day when our gatherings have been taking place over the past year), and last, but not least, our unquenchable inborn necessity for exploring collective forms of art.             </p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Who are we, ThursdaySquareCirclers?           </strong></p><p><br/><br/>                Though we consider each participant in our events as a rightful member of ThursdaySquareCircle, our core remains strong through the continuous efforts of Monica Borissova (painter), Zahari Zahariev (philosopher, poet, writer), Denitsa Boeva (painter), Stratsimir Baryakov (philosopher, poet) and Dian Dinev (musician, photographer, painter). And all of the countless fireflies of imagination, which join their light with ours when we create worlds...</p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What do we crazyhead ThursdaySquareCirclers do?     </strong></p><p><strong>           </strong><br/><br/>                Firstly, we select one of our beloved ideo-spiritual attitudes or a cultural/artistic movement and with the conjoint efforts of the circle‘s mental particle accelerator, we study their main ideas and principles. We choose a place and time for the happening, after which we start figuring out the ways in which the chosen spacetime can be reconfigured so as to suit and express the ideo-spiritual attunement. We stop once we have come upon a fitting frame for the transformative act, as we wish to leave ample space for spontaneous reimaginings which will befall us and the rest of the participants throughout the course of the event itself.  We conduct lectures, seminar readings of representative texts and come up with artistic practices based on those, so that what is learned is enacted in reconfiguring the space, atmosphere and relationship between all co-creators – there were ThursdaySquareCirclers have chosen for imagination to become reality. Finally, we take on ourselves the making of the world-perceiving domain of the ideo-spiritual attunement, so that it may become the basis and condition for the artistic experience of each participant’s daily living.                         </p><p style=""text-align: center;"">     </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong> This year’s event by ThursdayFourCircle – Engardened Magic (from 01.07.2017 to 01.09.2017)           </strong></p><p><br/> <br/> This year, we shall unfold a fantastical world through the ideas and principle of magical realism. We’ll be reading Borges, Cortázar, Márquez, Pavić, Radichkov perhaps, as well as other texts inclined towards magical realism. We will discuss their ideas, root them and look after them, as one would take care of plants, in the space of a house and its yard in the Kamen village. Some of the framing project-practices, which the core of ThursdayFourCircle has pre-envisioned (so as to not leave spontaneity all to itself) are:                     </p><ul>
<li>lectures and seminar formatted readings of magical realist texts led by the core of ThursdayFourCircle          </li>
<li>drawing under the accompaniment of audio recordings of poetry belonging to or reminiscent of magical realism      </li>
<li>textile dyeing using the Shibori technique        </li>
<li>poetic masquerade walks to the nearby river (making the use of provided unusual clothing and accessory items)     </li>
<li> materializing Borges’s fantastical creatures in the shape of art installations   </li>
<li>making artisanal magical night <i>liutenitsa</i> (traditional Bulgarian chutney prepared from roasted peppers, tomatoes and spices). The process will include performing poetry to it, playing jazz, blues, funk and other improvised forms of madness, all under candlelight, so as to ensure the truly psychotropic quality of the liutenitsa.   </li>
<li>a workshop for making dream journals. Throughout the event, the participants will be encouraged to keep a record of their dreams, and by the end of it, they will walk away with a journal containing the handwritten narratives of other participants’ dreams as well.    </li>
<li>numerous other marvels, such as: surrealist techniques for spontaneous writing, meditations on the absurd conducted through the aid of reading parts of multiple books in a short time frame, planetary <i>horo</i> (Balkan group dances which wind in various shapes, most often a circle) , day and night reversal and many, oh so many more surprises...                 </li>
</ul><p style=""text-align: center;""><br/><strong>What do we need your magical papers (a.k.a. money) for?  </strong></p><p><br/><br/>Materials. Materials. And more...materials. Yet again! To realize everything thus far described and thought out, we will require a panoply of artistic and practical supplies - canvases, paints, brushes, fine-liners, around 2000 candles, ropes and strings, fabrics, clay, eccentric clothes and accessories, fuel to transport everything to the event venue (such as the library of 700 books which will be spread across different spaces in our shared place), and a whole lot of other necessities. Not to mention the amount of effort and labor invested in the venture by its organizers. As one of the main goals of our events is to introduce an artistic dimension into our daily life, we will provide basic foodstuffs for all participants, so as to turn eating and its contingent preparations into an enchantment-laden, communal activity, and your magical papers are required to fulfill this intention. Currently, we have a bit under half of the necessary funds to realize the event. Should your generosity satisfy or surpass our estimates, any surplus thus accumulated will be put into the foundations of next year’s event, and maybe even the registration of ThursdayFourCirlce as a company dedicated to our further fantastical poetic worldmaking ventures.          </p><p>    </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>What do you get in return for your benevolent support?                      </strong></p><p><br/>To the right you’ll find descriptions of what you’ll receive in return for your shekels. Delivery of the said items will take place between 10 and 20 days of the event’s finale, as all magical gifts will be crafted during its course, and imbued with the charge and lunacy of what we do. That is to say, expect them between 10.09.2017 and 20.09.2017. Beyond that, once our doings are complete, you will be able to look through photos and perhaps even videos of the event on our Facebook page, to elevate your joy of having helped the happening of such an aesthetic curiosity. Should a plentiful rain of shekels fall upon us, we will organize an exhibition of our artistic creations in Sliven, and why not even Sofia? Do share the joy of these by spreading the word amongst the places and people you know! Should the precipitation of giving take us by surprise, we will respond to this flood by writing a theatre screenplay based on our participants’ recorded dreams. So your shekels will also bring you the enjoyment of a spectacle filled with the enchanting powers of the full moon and the visions of our dreamscapes.     </p><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Other ways of spellcasting your support of our cause             </strong></p><p><br/>There’s a link to ThursdaySquareCircle’s Facebook page provided (click the red About, up and right of the page), we will appreciate and interact with your advice, questions, and miscellaneous ponderings. That’s also the portal through which you can find out more about attending the event as a participant. Each of you can spread the awareness of our doings virtually and by word of mouth, as we dearly want to fulfill our intentions and reach out to more benevolent heartminds out there.

ЧетворКръг е концептуалната лаборатория за проектирането на тези събития, а тяхната основна цел е преобразяване и претворяване на средата (където се провежда някое от тях) спрямо идеите на предварително избраната идейно-духовна нагласа. Как ни хрумна ЧетворКръг? С много четене, със съдействието на мицела на вдъхновението, безрезервната помощ на мосю Четвъртък (в продължение на повече от година събранията ни протичат предимно в този ден) и неумолимата вътрешна необходимост за изследване на колективни форми на изкуството. Кои сме ние, ЧетворКръгленци? Макар че смятаме всеки участник в нашите събития за член на ЧетворКръг, ядрото е здраво и постоянства както следва – Моника Борисова (художник), Захари Захариев (философ, поет, писател), Деница Боева (художник), Срацимир Баряков (философ и поет), Диан Динев (музикант, фотограф, художник). И всички онези безчет светулки на фантазията, които решават да посветят заедно с нас, когато творим светове. Какво правим ние, лудаците от ЧетворКръг? Най-напред избираме някоя присърцата нам идейно-духовна нагласа или направление в изкуството и културата и със съвместни усилия на ядронния колайдер на ЧетворКръг проучваме основните им идеи и принципи. Избираме място и време за провеждане на събитието, след което започваме да мъдруваме относно начините, по които избраното място и време могат да бъдат преобразувани - тъй щото да отговарят на и изразяват самата идейно-духовна нагласа. Спираме се обаче в тази мъдрост, когато преценим, че сме измислили само рамкиращия проект за преобразуването на средата, тъй щото в събитието ни да остане щедро място за спонтанни и своевременни на протичането му възможности за доизмисляне на онова, което ще правим заедно с гостуващите участници. Провеждаме лекции, семинарно-дискусионни четения на забележителни за избраното движение текстове и на базата на тях измисляме художествени практики, чрез които наученото да бъде осъществено в преобразуване на пространството, атмосферата и отношенията между всички съ-творители - там, където ЧетворКръгленци са избрали фантазията да стане действителност. И накрая – заемаме се с направата на цялостната световъзприетивна сфера на идейно-духовната нагласа, тъй щото тя самата да стане основа и условие за художествено преживяване на всекидневието от страна на всички участници. Тазгодишното събитие на Четворкръг – „Въдворена Магия“ (от 01.07.2017 до 01.09.2017) Тази година ще разгърнем фантастичен свят през идеите и принципите на Магическия реализъм. Ще четем Борхес, Кортасар, Маркес, Павич, може би Радичков, както и други текстове, водещи смислово към магическия реализъм.

Or to put it in other words – an interdisciplinary intellectual circle for creating temporary virtual marvelous worlds. A platform for realizing them. A workshop for vitalizing ideo-spiritual attunements in art and culture, such as romanticism and magical realism. An outdoorsy artistic practical, a festival, an educational method and a celebration of creativity – this is what our yearly events combine and interlace within themselves. ThursdaySquareCircle is the conceptual laboratory which projects these happenings, the main purpose of which is to transform and transmute their immediate surroundings in accordance with the perspectives of the ideo-spiritual attitude being explored.                           What are the origins of ThursdaySquareCircle? Heaps of reading, generous assistance from the mycelium of inspiration, the unfailing support of Monsieur Thursday (the day when our gatherings have been taking place over the past year), and last, but not least, our unquenchable inborn necessity for exploring collective forms of art.              Who are we, ThursdaySquareCirclers?                           Though we consider each participant in our events as a rightful member of ThursdaySquareCircle, our core remains strong through the continuous efforts of Monica Borissova (painter), Zahari Zahariev (philosopher, poet, writer), Denitsa Boeva (painter), Stratsimir Baryakov (philosopher, poet) and Dian Dinev (musician, photographer, painter). And all of the countless fireflies of imagination, which join their light with ours when we create worlds... What do we crazyhead ThursdaySquareCirclers do?                                Firstly, we select one of our beloved ideo-spiritual attitudes or a cultural/artistic movement and with the conjoint efforts of the circle‘s mental particle accelerator, we study their main ideas and principles. We choose a place and time for the happening, after which we start figuring out the ways in which the chosen spacetime can be reconfigured so as to suit and express the ideo-spiritual attunement. We stop once we have come upon a fitting frame for the transformative act, as we wish to leave ample space for spontaneous reimaginings which will befall us and the rest of the participants throughout the course of the event itself.  We conduct lectures, seminar readings of representative texts and come up with artistic practices based on those, so that what is learned is enacted in reconfiguring the space, atmosphere and relationship between all co-creators – there were ThursdaySquareCirclers have chosen for imagination to become reality. Finally, we take on ourselves the making of the world-perceiving domain of the ideo-spiritual attunement, so that it may become the basis and condition for the artistic experience of each participant’s daily living.                               This year’s event by ThursdayFourCircle – Engardened Magic (from 01.07.2017 to 01.09.2017)             This year, we shall unfold a fantastical world through the ideas and principle of magical realism. We’ll be reading Borges, Cortázar, Márquez, Pavić, Radichkov perhaps, as well as other texts inclined towards magical realism. We will discuss their ideas, root them and look after them, as one would take care of plants, in the space of a house and its yard in the Kamen village. Some of the framing project-practices, which the core of ThursdayFourCircle has pre-envisioned (so as to not leave spontaneity all to itself) are:                     
lectures and seminar formatted readings of magical realist texts led by the core of ThursdayFourCircle          
drawing under the accompaniment of audio recordings of poetry belonging to or reminiscent of magical realism      
textile dyeing using the Shibori technique        
poetic masquerade walks to the nearby river (making the use of provided unusual clothing and accessory items)     
 materializing Borges’s fantastical creatures in the shape of art installations   
making artisanal magical night liutenitsa (traditional Bulgarian chutney prepared from roasted peppers, tomatoes and spices). The process will include performing poetry to it, playing jazz, blues, funk and other improvised forms of madness, all under candlelight, so as to ensure the truly psychotropic quality of the liutenitsa.   
a workshop for making dream journals. Throughout the event, the participants will be encouraged to keep a record of their dreams, and by the end of it, they will walk away with a journal containing the handwritten narratives of other participants’ dreams as well.    
numerous other marvels, such as: surrealist techniques for spontaneous writing, meditations on the absurd conducted through the aid of reading parts of multiple books in a short time frame, planetary horo (Balkan group dances which wind in various shapes, most often a circle) , day and night reversal and many, oh so many more surprises...                 
What do we need your magical papers (a.k.a. money) for?  Materials. Materials. And more...materials. Yet again! To realize everything thus far described and thought out, we will require a panoply of artistic and practical supplies - canvases, paints, brushes, fine-liners, around 2000 candles, ropes and strings, fabrics, clay, eccentric clothes and accessories, fuel to transport everything to the event venue (such as the library of 700 books which will be spread across different spaces in our shared place), and a whole lot of other necessities. Not to mention the amount of effort and labor invested in the venture by its organizers. As one of the main goals of our events is to introduce an artistic dimension into our daily life, we will provide basic foodstuffs for all participants, so as to turn eating and its contingent preparations into an enchantment-laden, communal activity, and your magical papers are required to fulfill this intention. Currently, we have a bit under half of the necessary funds to realize the event. Should your generosity satisfy or surpass our estimates, any surplus thus accumulated will be put into the foundations of next year’s event, and maybe even the registration of ThursdayFourCirlce as a company dedicated to our further fantastical poetic worldmaking ventures.              What do you get in return for your benevolent support?                      To the right you’ll find descriptions of what you’ll receive in return for your shekels. Delivery of the said items will take place between 10 and 20 days of the event’s finale, as all magical gifts will be crafted during its course, and imbued with the charge and lunacy of what we do. That is to say, expect them between 10.09.2017 and 20.09.2017. Beyond that, once our doings are complete, you will be able to look through photos and perhaps even videos of the event on our Facebook page, to elevate your joy of having helped the happening of such an aesthetic curiosity. Should a plentiful rain of shekels fall upon us, we will organize an exhibition of our artistic creations in Sliven, and why not even Sofia? Do share the joy of these by spreading the word amongst the places and people you know! Should the precipitation of giving take us by surprise, we will respond to this flood by writing a theatre screenplay based on our participants’ recorded dreams. So your shekels will also bring you the enjoyment of a spectacle filled with the enchanting powers of the full moon and the visions of our dreamscapes.      Other ways of spellcasting your support of our cause             There’s a link to ThursdaySquareCircle’s Facebook page provided (click the red About, up and right of the page), we will appreciate and interact with your advice, questions, and miscellaneous ponderings. That’s also the portal through which you can find out more about attending the event as a participant. Each of you can spread the awareness of our doings virtually and by word of mouth, as we dearly want to fulfill our intentions and reach out to more benevolent heartminds out there. Each reasoned and spirited imaginary becomes actuality, as Hegel did not say.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Double Blind Surprise. We are here to be your magical gifting elves and to turn you into everyone's favorite gift-giver! With us, you'll never again have to see that ""Oh, uh, thank you..."" forced smile on your nephew's face when he opens your present. No, those days are in the past. We'll take on the stress; you get all the glory.</p>
<p>Adrienne Cook, our founder and Head Surpriser, is a mother, a fighter, and an artist herself with a Master's Degree in Fine Art. Throughout her time in school and in her art-world navigating life, she has been able to make connections with all manner of supremely talented and tireless artists who make awesome goods that you need to know about. Adrienne has always had a knack for giving personalized gifts and has developed this particular model of mutual surprise to bring that knowledge and skill to as many people as possible. Sharing is caring and she thinks you're great.</p>
<p>With your help, we can grow this idea to a wonderful reality where it's as fun to give a gift as it is to receive one, where artists can be artists and make everything a little bit sparklier, and a present is so much more than an obligation.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>With the aid of your generous backing, we’ll be able to first and foremost expand the stockpile of goods from our stable of 75+ affiliated artists, creatives, and makers to better laser-target your gift-ee’s most perfect gift.  </p>
<p>Our maker cohorts reside all over the world, with a wide variety of goods—and with increased capital to stock up on the best stuff, we’ll be better able to select, send out, and solve your gift-giving problems. After padding our inventory, we plan to use our gains in support of work with our partner artists/makers to produce a series of Double Blind Surprise exclusive goods for gifts, special events, and holidays --just like the ones made fresh for backers of the first two levels of this campaign!</p>
<p>Everything we do and everything we are is here for the support of creatives, their endeavors, and all of us having fun while getting it done! We want Double Blind Surprise to be a platform where artists can grow their community and be seen by new people, and people can find new artists and makers they love!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Remember when there was nothing more exciting than opening presents at your birthday party? Why did that stop? Because we're taller and busier and boring now? No, gifts should be just as fun as they've ever been!  We're tired of gift cards and buying the same stuff as everyone else, aren't you? Why not support small businesses, discover great new makers, and laugh your face off while you do it? You may be taller but you're NOT boring. We're here to help you remember that.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest challenge is having something in stock ready to be hand-picked for every person, every taste, and every style. We want to be able to grow to a place where we can be most confident that our goods will deliver a smile on both ends of the exchange, every. single. time. While we’ve already been hard at work, and gathered a substantial spectrum of goods, we know that it will take just a little more time, a few more big wholesale orders from our makers, and a flurry of excited social sharing from our kickoff backers to reach that place of optimum inventory and exposure.</p>
<p>We're always researching new makers and new products with great style and quality and we know with time and learning from you, our customers, this challenge can and will be conquered!<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Love the project but can't contribute right now? That's okay! Tell your friends! Tell your mom! Tell everyone around you by using social media to send people to our Indiegogo page with the Indiegogo share tools.  Every little bit helps and we'll love you forever.</p>
<h3>THANK YOU!</h3>
<p>A big big thanks to Zach and Jayme Waldt of Film Guy Productions for the video, to Alexa Hall for writing, to Glenn Potter and Wes Larsen of Tocco Creative for the website, and most of all, my long-suffering husband, Gregory Scott Cook,  for the thousand things that fell in his lap because he's good at everything. </p>

<h3>A beautifully hand drawn deck of 64 Daily Do It Cards to help you set your intention for the day ahead.</h3>
<p>What if there was a way to help you start your day on the right foot ? To get your day going without letting everything get to you before it even happens ?</p>
<p>Have you ever wondered . . . .</p>
<ul>
<li>Why things don’t go according to plan ?</li>
<li>Why you get so easily distracted ?</li>
<li>Why you lose your focus ?</li>
<li>Why things get in the way of doing what you want to do ?</li>
</ul>
<p>What if there was a quick and easy way to help you</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay focused ?</li>
<li>Stay on track ?</li>
<li>Help you keep your mind on the things important to you ?</li>
<li>Or simply give you something to think about for the day ahead ?</li>
</ul>
<p>Well the good news is that there is a way to help you achieve these things and it’s something so simple that we don’t often think about it.</p>
<p>In fact, it’s something so quick that it literally takes you 10 seconds of your day to do yet creates something to focus on and get your mind engaged and ready.</p>
<p>And you can do it anywhere.</p>
<p>Any time.</p>
<p>Any how.</p>
<ul>
<li>Whether you’re lying in bed having just opened your eyes.</li>
<li>Or waiting for the kettle to boil before your first cup of coffee in the morning.</li>
<li>On the tube or bus or in the car on the way to work.</li>
<li>It’s so simple, you could even do it while you’re sitting on the loo.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wanna know what it is ?</p>
<p>Setting an intention for your day.</p>
<p>It’s the difference between having a productive, worthwhile day and one that’s well, that’s just another day towards the end of another year filled with missed opposrtunities and wishes for things you could have or should have done.</p>
<p>You might be asking – but what’s that got to do with anything ?</p>
<p>Well. If you don’t set an intention for your day or life, then someone (or something) else is going to come along and set it for you.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it’s the smallest, simplest, seemingly too easy things that we don’t do.</p>
<p>It’s those things that we take for granted and yes, believe it or not, setting an intention is one of them.</p>
<p>But what is an intention you might be sitting there asking.</p>
<p>Well, for us, it’s </p>
<ul>
<li>An idea that you plan or intend to carry out</li>
<li>Something you mean to do</li>
<li>Your goal. Your aim. Your purpose.</li>
<li>How you choose to show up in any given period of time.</li>
</ul>
<p>And we’ve seen how the small act of setting an intention at the start of your day really makes a difference.</p>
<p>So we’ve put something together for you that can be used, like we said earlier, any where, any time and any how.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>A beautifully hand drawn deck of 64 Daily Do It Cards to help you set your intention for the day ahead.</h3>
<p>Shuffle the deck and pick one first thing in the morning.</p>
<p>Having a wobbly moment – simply pick on to help re-shift your frame of mind and get you focused on something productive again.</p>
<p>Use them as a self coaching tool to help you uncover stumbling blocks, things that might be holding you back or simply to look at things with a fresh perspective.</p>
<p>Keep them next to your bed, in your bag and carry them with you or wherever you choose. </p>
<p>Each deck comes with 64 totally unique cards, each with their own related intention for you to insert into your day.</p>
<p>The hardest part of it all ? </p>
<p>Opening the box and shuffling them.</p>
<p>So if you’re ready to get your focus back on track, improve you productivity or simply have a tool to motivate and inspire you each day, then get involved today and with your help, you could have your very own deck in your hands in the next few weeks.</p>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>In order for us to make this a reality, we need your support to raise the funds to get the first batch of cards printed. We've searched around locally for printers to get these done for us and have managed to find someone who can help us through the whole project - from scanning in every single hand drawn image, adding in the relevant graphics and boxing them up.</p>
<p>To print small quantities is quite cost prohibitive so in order to keep the costs as low as possible right now, we would like to get a batch of 100 decks of cards printed out.</p>
<p>All the original A4 drawings are currently with the printers, waiting patiently for the GO button be pressed so to do this, we need to raise a minimum of 1,250.00 euros. </p>
<p>This will help us cover the costs of getting the first batch printed, as well as covering shipment costs to fulfil orders</p>
<h3>What's In The Deck</h3>
<p>Each deck of cards will contain 64 totally unique cards, all of which have been hand drawn during a difficult time some years ago. </p>
<p>We originally started using our prototype at our Retreat in Spain to help people create intentions or to be used as a prompt for journalling.</p>
<p>Personally, we use them every day, or even during difficult times.</p>
<p>They help us stay focused. They give us things to think about.</p>
<p>And without being all ""woo woo"" and ""out there"" they always seem to deliver just the right thing at just the right time. </p>
<p>Here's what comes in each deck of cards:-</p>
<p>** 64 cards per set (A6 size 105mm x 148mm)<br/>** Full colour double sided<br/>** Custom printed faces with logo to reverse<br/>** 320gsm smooth playing card stock<br/>** Die cut to size with rounded corners<br/>** Supplied with personalised tuck boxes that will have instructions printed on them too.</p>
<p>We are also currently finalising an Instruction Booklet that will be an electronic version available ONLY to people who purchase the cards. This Booklet will give you an insight as to how we interpret each card, but can also be used as a self coaching tool, giving you questions to think about that will open up your mind to a different way of thinking.</p>
<h3>What If We Don't Reach Our Target</h3>
<p>That's a difficult one because we really would like to make this a reality for everyone. Should we not reach our minimum target, we will have to look into how we can raise the balance to get everything printed - it's as simple as that for us but that could mean it might just take us a little bit longer than we hope.</p>
<h3>What If We Exceed Our Target</h3>
<p>We have some exciting plans and depending on how much we exceed the target by, we have another special product lined up that we have created which is ready to go.</p>
<p>The Feel Good Factor is a book we wrote some time ago and is a 250+ page book that combines elements of what we do at our Retreat in Spain to create something truly special.</p>
<p>It's a 29 Day Challenge, created to help you Feel Good Again and can be used in a number of different ways - use it as a coaching tool. Use it as an inspiration tool. Use it as a journal. The choice is yours really and we're finalising prices to get a limited edition printed so should we exceed our target by enough, we will be getting these printed.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We have seen how the simple act of setting an intention can create a difference in how we approach our day and thanks to people who have been following us on Social Media, it's down to their constant requests that we are putting this together. </p>
<p>They show up every day to see what card has been selected and have found that it really does help.</p>
<p>We will also be making a contribution to CALM (Campaign Against Living Miserably) who are a charity extremely close to our hearts so every deck sold will help break the stigma surrounding mental health and work towards reducing the suicide rate amongst men.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Our BIGGEST challenge will be reaching our target and to be honest, it's why we have put off doing this before.</p>
<p>We get nervous. We worry what people will think. We question ourselves, just like everyone does.</p>
<p>But people have been asking and we simply want to put our beliefs into action by taking this small step towards helping people live healthier and happier lives.</p>
<p>All the hard work has, quite literally, been done.</p>
<p>Every single card drawn has taken at least 6 to 8 hours to complete - that's over 500 hours of drawing and doodling. About 3 SOLID weeks of sitting down, putting everything together.</p>
<p>Every single card has a deeply personal meaning and reason why it was drawn, all of which will be explained in the booklet that will accompany it online for you to access.</p>
<p>So the work is done and all that's waiting is that ""money"" part</p>

</div></div>","A beautifully hand drawn deck of 64 Daily Do It Cards to help you set your intention for the day ahead.
What if there was a way to help you start your day on the right foot ? To get your day going without letting everything get to you before it even happens ?
Have you ever wondered . . . .

Why things don’t go according to plan ?
Why you get so easily distracted ?
Why you lose your focus ?
Why things get in the way of doing what you want to do ?

What if there was a quick and easy way to help you

Stay focused ?
Stay on track ?
Help you keep your mind on the things important to you ?
Or simply give you something to think about for the day ahead ?

Well the good news is that there is a way to help you achieve these things and it’s something so simple that we don’t often think about it.
In fact, it’s something so quick that it literally takes you 10 seconds of your day to do yet creates something to focus on and get your mind engaged and ready.
And you can do it anywhere.
Any time.
Any how.

Whether you’re lying in bed having just opened your eyes.
Or waiting for the kettle to boil before your first cup of coffee in the morning.
On the tube or bus or in the car on the way to work.
It’s so simple, you could even do it while you’re sitting on the loo.

Wanna know what it is ?
Setting an intention for your day.
It’s the difference between having a productive, worthwhile day and one that’s well, that’s just another day towards the end of another year filled with missed opposrtunities and wishes for things you could have or should have done.
You might be asking – but what’s that got to do with anything ?
Well. If you don’t set an intention for your day or life, then someone (or something) else is going to come along and set it for you.
Here’s the thing.
Sometimes, it’s the smallest, simplest, seemingly too easy things that we don’t do.
It’s those things that we take for granted and yes, believe it or not, setting an intention is one of them.
But what is an intention you might be sitting there asking.
Well, for us, it’s 

An idea that you plan or intend to carry out
Something you mean to do
Your goal. Your aim. Your purpose.
How you choose to show up in any given period of time.

And we’ve seen how the small act of setting an intention at the start of your day really makes a difference.
So we’ve put something together for you that can be used, like we said earlier, any where, any time and any how.

A beautifully hand drawn deck of 64 Daily Do It Cards to help you set your intention for the day ahead.
Shuffle the deck and pick one first thing in the morning.
Having a wobbly moment – simply pick on to help re-shift your frame of mind and get you focused on something productive again.
Use them as a self coaching tool to help you uncover stumbling blocks, things that might be holding you back or simply to look at things with a fresh perspective.
Keep them next to your bed, in your bag and carry them with you or wherever you choose. 
Each deck comes with 64 totally unique cards, each with their own related intention for you to insert into your day.
The hardest part of it all ? 
Opening the box and shuffling them.
So if you’re ready to get your focus back on track, improve you productivity or simply have a tool to motivate and inspire you each day, then get involved today and with your help, you could have your very own deck in your hands in the next few weeks.

<p>Like pages from a coloring book, ColorClings feature line illustrations for people of all ages to enjoy coloring. Only these patent pending adhesive backed pages stick directly to your wall door or any smooth service allowing users to color from a more comfortable upright position. They are larger than a standard coloring book and come four pages to a pack. The temporal adhesive backing allows you to keep these colorful collages on display for years – or they can be removed and replaced whenever you choose.</p>
<p>Mr.T-Shirt is a patent pending mix-and-match product, which allows users to print a unique face on a T-shirt. Combine eyes, mouths, beards, and accessories to design a character as silly or serious as you’d like. Each Mr. T-Shirt set comes with three blank T-shirts, and 12 facial elements to mix, match, and print. The elements are iron-on adhesive, so parental supervision is required. But when finished you’ll have not just one, but three brand new comfy T-shirts for you to wear proudly about.</p>
<p>For each of these products, Able Media Co. is devoted to bringing you plenty of options to create from, but I am limited to my own creations and what’s in the public domain. Design options include The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, the Able Media original WrestleVerse, and US Presidents; with more to come.</p>
<p>That's where this campaign comes in. Through my art and wrestling careers I have made connections across many states with other artists and wrestlers, and I’d like to put their works and their likenesses on these products. Plus, like most people around the country I’m also a fan of pop culture. And I’d love to see huge brands associated with these products. I’d like to see them become the next big collectables available in retail stores with everybody’s favorite super heroes, athletes, princesses, and cartoon characters as options to create from.<br/>So I need your help.<br/><br/>If the campaign reaches $5,000 I will announce the first series of licensed artwork, and distributors attached for future release.</p>
<p>If the campaign reaches $10,000 I will purchase a new printer, computer, and operating system in order to produce ImaginAble content more efficiently.</p>
<p>If the campaign reaches it’s $15,000 goal I will be hiring additional artists to create designs for products AND I'll use this campaign as a pitch to the biggest retailers and brands around.</p>

But the thought of the <u>""Dirty Beetles""</u> not being represented at the burn at all this year is something we all agreed we weren’t ready for. So for now our aim is to be apart of this new emerging technology and get the art car to the burn virtually.

This is your last chance to get some fresh DB swag before it's all gone. The Dirty Beetles camp and Boog Art Car needs your support.It's been a strange year to say the least, but we need continue to move forward.So we got to pull up our socks and help each other get thru this crazy time. Usually this time of year we throw events that support our yearly expenses (insurance, storage, utilities etc.) But with no events happening this year or in the near future, we are falling short of goal.  So we are looking to our friends and family for help....We've created a new line of Dirty Beetle 2020 perks and gifts made exclusively for this drive to help raise some funds. This will be the only run of these so get them while you can.You still have time to help support us and pick up some of our newest DB swag in the process.We’d love to see all of our Dirty Beetle friends rocking it on their block.
Please give what you can every dollar goes to help pay the bills and keep the lights on. Help us get thru this rough patch and look sexy doing it. Grab a perk or donate any amount.even $5 will help.  THANKS  UPDATE 9/18/20 : WE DID IT !!!We went virtual. We live streamed over 50+ DJ sets during Burn week. The 3D renderings came out looking amazing! Thanks to everyone that supported us during this new experience.You can check out some of the saved streams you might have missed @ the Dirty Beetle Twitch page: https://www.twitch.tv/dirtybeetles  Also : last chance to grab our limited edition 2020 Dirty Beetle Swag   UPDATE: 8/31/20WE ARE LIVE
www.INFINITE PLAYA.com Boog Art Car has gone virtual & beyond..... Join the Dirty Beetles on an adventure like nothing we’ve done before. Over 10 years ago a small group of miscreants coined the named “Dirty Beetles"", since then it has become a name internationally know with having fun and bringing a warm welcoming family vibe to the playa and beyond. Together we created  The Boog Art Car Project  converting a Short School Bus (that was the school bus on Catalina island) into a rolling piece of art & DJ booth. It's been a long strange trip.... Now we are seeking funding for our trip to the virtual playa.  In the current state where everything feels broken, we strive to connect in new ways to expand our connectivity, individually and as a whole. After seeing the new technology that is emerging participating in one of the 8 Virtual Burns happening this month and also debut the new design our Art Car was sorting we wanted to apart of. So we have commissioned artists to create 3-D renderings of our newest version of The Boog Art Car Project Additionally our annual camp is typically funded  through a series of event based fundraisers and yearly camp dues. However with the absence of all events happening this year, and the burn cancelled our primary source of income for running the camp and coving our yearly maintenance costs has also been lost. So in the absence of these things we decided to press on anyway and make all the normal Burning Man camp swag that we usually make and give them as gifts for those who donate and help make our virtual dream a virtual reality.With your donation you are helping us bring BOOG art car to life and to the virtual burn. We will be apart of 1 of 8 virtual burns this year, ours is called “Infinite Playa” . With your help we insure that our special brand of WILDLIFE reaches every corner of the globe and we can still be part of the Burning Man culture we love. Into the unknown.....Honestly we have no idea what the impact of this VR gathering will be, we are sailing towards uncharted territory. But the thought of the ""Dirty Beetles"" not being represented at the burn at all this year is something we all agreed we weren’t ready for. So for now our aim is to be apart of this new emerging technology and get the art car to the burn virtually. As part of this virtual experience we will be able to move around the VR playa and have live performances streamed from the DJ booth just as it would be on the real playa. We will be posting DJ line ups and performances soon. There will be a free 2D version that is accessible by anyone as well as a 3D interactive world for a fee. Check out the website “Infinite Playa”  for more info.  Our goal is to raise $5000 dollars to cover the 3D rendering costs, storage fees for all camp gear and cost of creating the perks. Anything we make over that goal will go to repairs, maintenance and rebuilding of the new design with the plan to  bring Boog Art Car out to the real playa in 2021.This is a low risk year for the Dirty Beetles, but a high reward if we can all unite virtually around the most magical art car ever created. We realize money is tight and not everyone can donate... so how can you help?We know through the absence of what we do how essential our social community is.. So please share this on your favorite social media platform and tell a friend or two..If you ever had a magical night on “Boog” or if you kicked it with some Dirty Beetles at one of our events and it felt like family, but you can’t donate, help us get the word out… it's really simple.  You can use the share tools on the Indigogo page or copy and paste the link. Thanks for listening and  lets HELP MAKE DIRTY BEETLES GO VIRTUAL !!!",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>""An artist’s duty, as far as I’m concerned, is to reflect the times. I think that is true of painters, sculptors, poets, musicians. As far as I’m concerned, it’s their choice, but I CHOOSE to reflect the times and situations in which I find myself. That, to me, is my duty. And at this crucial time in our lives, when everything is so desperate, when everyday is a matter of survival, I don’t think you can help but be involved. Young people, black and white, know this. That’s why they’re so involved in politics. We will shape and mold this country or it will not be molded and shaped at all anymore. So I don’t think you have a choice.

With growing metropolitan areas and a budding local economy, now more than ever is the perfect time to create something big.  That's why we, a handful of local college students and the owner of <a href=""http://www.musclecarranch.com/#Previous-Bands"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Muscle Car Ranch</a>, want to put on an event where Oklahoma artists not only get to showcase their talents, but other Oklahomans will also get to come together to experience much of what this great state has to offer.  This is a big endeavor that we are all very passionate about but we can't do it without your help!</p>
<p>Twister Fest will be a multi-day event free of division lines.  We want to showcase all genres of music: indie, alternative, rock, hip hop, country, bluegrass and much more!  There will be booths set up where artists can display and sell their original works. Local Oklahoma food trucks and an Oklahoma brewer will be selling food and drink throughout the entire festival.  To those who purchase two day passes, you will be able to camp out for the entire weekend, starting on Friday and ending on Sunday.</p>
<p>Muscle Car Ranch has hosted a plethora of music events in the past, with acts such as: Jefferson Starship, Ambrosia, Dr. Hook, The Turtles, Lovin' Spoonful and so much more!  Curtis Hart, owner of the Ranch has taken a couple of years off to develop and improve his land to where this next level could be possible.  He has added two more stages to his property and is ready to take this festival head on. </p>
<p>Dallas Howard and Devin Murphy are two students from Oklahoma City University who are very passionate about music, especially within the local scene.  Dallas is a music composition senior who has put on music events of a smaller caliber, but is ready to make something truly exciting.  He is from the LA area and has had many good experiences at various festivals around the country and is excited to bring something truly special to his new home in Oklahoma.</p>
<p>Devin is a business marketing senior who is very passionate about supporting the arts in Oklahoma.  She was an intern at the Oklahoma Film and Music Office, danced for years with the Ballet Oklahoma School of Dance (now OKC Ballet) and was also a founding member of the Teen Oklahoma City Arts Council. Now she is excited to help continue to bring attention and exposure to the talent she sees in her state.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <span style=""background-color: initial;"">We are asking for both corporate sponsorships and crowdsourcing donations to help cover the immense cost of this event. We are trying to reach at least $100,000 of that through crowdsourcing. We hope that you will feel just as passionate about supporting local talent as we do.  Every little donation counts so please consider offering your support!  With your help we will be able to cover:</span>
</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><ul>
<li>Down payments to get acts to the festival (This is the largest cost)</li>
<li>Covering liability costs that must be made in order for us to allow for patrons to camp out</li>
<li>Staff and volunteer compensation</li>
<li>Legal costs</li>
<li>Costs of having medical assistance on site</li>
<li>Security costs</li>
<li>Light and Sound for the stages</li>
</ul></span></div><div>Donation perks are as follows:</div><div><ul>
<li>Any donation of $100 and up will let you have your choice of land for camping out during the festival as well as a food voucher to any of the food trucks there</li>
<li>Any donation of $500 and up will let you meet our headliner (TBA)</li>
<li>Any donation of $1000 and up will get your name listed among our sponsors</li>
</ul></div><div>All donations will be going to a separate account set up specifically for financing this festival.</div><div>

</div></div>","Short Summary & Who We Are Oklahoma is a state full of culture, history and talent. With growing metropolitan areas and a budding local economy, now more than ever is the perfect time to create something big.  That's why we, a handful of local college students and the owner of Muscle Car Ranch, want to put on an event where Oklahoma artists not only get to showcase their talents, but other Oklahomans will also get to come together to experience much of what this great state has to offer.  This is a big endeavor that we are all very passionate about but we can't do it without your help!
Twister Fest will be a multi-day event free of division lines.  We want to showcase all genres of music: indie, alternative, rock, hip hop, country, bluegrass and much more!  There will be booths set up where artists can display and sell their original works. Local Oklahoma food trucks and an Oklahoma brewer will be selling food and drink throughout the entire festival.  To those who purchase two day passes, you will be able to camp out for the entire weekend, starting on Friday and ending on Sunday.
Muscle Car Ranch has hosted a plethora of music events in the past, with acts such as: Jefferson Starship, Ambrosia, Dr. Hook, The Turtles, Lovin' Spoonful and so much more!  Curtis Hart, owner of the Ranch has taken a couple of years off to develop and improve his land to where this next level could be possible.  He has added two more stages to his property and is ready to take this festival head on. 
Dallas Howard and Devin Murphy are two students from Oklahoma City University who are very passionate about music, especially within the local scene.  Dallas is a music composition senior who has put on music events of a smaller caliber, but is ready to make something truly exciting.  He is from the LA area and has had many good experiences at various festivals around the country and is excited to bring something truly special to his new home in Oklahoma.
Devin is a business marketing senior who is very passionate about supporting the arts in Oklahoma.  She was an intern at the Oklahoma Film and Music Office, danced for years with the Ballet Oklahoma School of Dance (now OKC Ballet) and was also a founding member of the Teen Oklahoma City Arts Council. Now she is excited to help continue to bring attention and exposure to the talent she sees in her state.   What We Need & What You Get We are asking for both corporate sponsorships and crowdsourcing donations to help cover the immense cost of this event. We are trying to reach at least $100,000 of that through crowdsourcing. We hope that you will feel just as passionate about supporting local talent as we do.  Every little donation counts so please consider offering your support!  With your help we will be able to cover:

Down payments to get acts to the festival (This is the largest cost)
Covering liability costs that must be made in order for us to allow for patrons to camp out
Staff and volunteer compensation
Legal costs
Costs of having medical assistance on site
Security costs
Light and Sound for the stages
Donation perks are as follows:
Any donation of $100 and up will let you have your choice of land for camping out during the festival as well as a food voucher to any of the food trucks there
Any donation of $500 and up will let you meet our headliner (TBA)
Any donation of $1000 and up will get your name listed among our sponsors
All donations will be going to a separate account set up specifically for financing this festival.
The Impact We hope for this even to be successful enough for us to be able to provide Oklahoma with a purely local and unique music and arts festival with the fun camping and activity based atmosphere.  With your help we can make this a reality.
    Risks & Challenges Obviously there is a fair amount of risk because this is a brand new idea and it is of a massive scale, however, with your support, we promise to create something unique, fun and new.  With Curtis's expertise of music events, and with the dedication of Dallas and Devin, we can promise you an experience you will not want to miss.  If we don't reach our goal we will have to scale down our operations, but with hopes that you and those you know are willing to lend your support, this will not be something we will have to do.

I was Born in Frankfurt, Germany to a Colombian mother and Puerto Rican father, which at the time was stationed there with the US Army.
Soon after, I traveled to Puerto Rico, Miami and finally, at the age of 7, to live in Bogota, Colombia, were I grew up. 
The lack of opportunities and my unwillingness to conform pushed me to travel to the US to pursue my dream of becoming an artist.
 I use a vast array of non- conventional materials such as: pills, hair, bottle caps, chop sticks, etc. I take common objects out of their context and using different techniques, I transform them into art pieces.
In my subject matter, I focus on the social challenges such as human rights, spirituality, consumerism, recycling, etc.In addition to gallery showings, I have participated in international cultural exchanges, workshops and talks.  I am also an art handler for several local galleries, museums and have done interior design for commercial spaces and local restaurants.



90 Miles
Everything started with my connection and appreciation for Afro-Cuban music as well as the social situation of the Cuban people.These two aspects gave me the idea of making a piece with multiple colors and rhythm as I try to convey the many things immigrants had to leave because of the political and social violations being inflicted upon them from an abusive power.

Where will the money go? Is quite simple! 
All the donations will be used to get 150,000 yards of yarn that I need to

What You Get
The basic donation will give the contributors the opportunity to be displayed on a list along with the final piece,  making them an essential component of the installation and its process of creation.
With the next level donation the contributors not only will be on the list but will also receive a print of any picture of the actions, please visit my gallery.

What We Need & What You Get Break it down for folks in more detail:  Explain how much funding you need and where it's going. Be transparent and specific-people need to trust you to want to fund you.  Tell people about your unique perks. Get them excited! Describe where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal.    The Impact Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know how the difference their contribution will make:  Explain why your project is valuable to the contributor and to the world. Point out your successful track record with projects like this (if you have one). Make it real for people and build trust.    Risks & Challenges  People value your transparency. Be open and stand out by providing insight into the risks and obstacles you may face on the way to achieving your goal.  Share what qualifies you to overcome these hurdles. Describe your plan for solving these challenges.    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign. Remind them to use the Indiegogo share tools!   And that's all there is to it.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Fascinated with miniature worlds, Alysha Farling creates sculptural installations that create enchanted environments. Her installations reach out from the ceiling and the walls, expanding into the space of the gallery, featuring an arrangement of small connecting balls of dirt planets, inhabited by creatures at play. Her challenge is to relocate magic in the sculptures; Farling says, “as a kid, magic was easy to locate, but now I am finding it difficult...When I talk about magic I am also including the dark and the strange – the tingly, the scary and the unexplainable.” <br/></p>

OLD MAN FASHIONISTA 
By GUILLERMO TREJO


50 Pages4 x 4 Inch Miniature BookSaddle StitchPrinted on archival paper
OLD MAN FASHIONISTA, by Guillermo Trejo, is a photographic visual diary of one man who appreciates how older men respect the gravitas of hats. Guillermo Trejo documented old men wearing hats in public during his travels across North America over the past year using his iPhone and posted them onto Instagram. For Trejo, wearing a hat is not a random action—it is a consideration. Yes, these men choose their hats based on external conditions, be it hot or cold, rainy, snowy, or sunny. Yet these men also choose their hats to show their personalities in public. These men are participating in a generational tradition. Trejo states, ""When I look at the old photographs of my late grandfather he was always wearing hats. My grandfather was a humble man. He was a construction worker who dressed well. I always loved him and his hats.""

THE ORIGIN STORY

    


ABOUT THE PDA PROJECTS TEAM







PDA PROJECTS director Brendan A. de Montigny met former co-founder Meredith Snider at the University of Ottawa during their Masters of Fine Arts. Both de Montigny and Snider have worked as practicing artists, educators, and either in commercial galleries, or artist-run centres. They came together in 2014 out of a similar passion to open a project space. Also, they both appreciate alliterations. Snider left PDA Projects in the summer of 2015 to follow he artistic career. Brendan still wears pink shirts, and the odd bow-tie, put's on exhibitions, and publishes books.  


 


PDA PROJECTS GALLERY
PDA Projects is an art gallery that currently represents 8 artists, and we invite other artists, and curators to exhibit solo or group shows. 
PDA PRESS 
The reason we are reaching out to you today. Come be a part of PDA PRESS!


ABOUT BRENDAN A. de MONTIGNY: 
I hold a DEC from Heritage College, a BFA from Concordia in Painting & Drawing with a minor in Print Media, and a MFA from the University of Ottawa. 
In my
own artistic practice and research, I work within large performative
installations, painting and drawing. I am interested in the ideas of decay/ruins, utopias, science fiction, subcultures (Punk-metal-hardcore), and comic books. My artwork has been seen at the AGO, Todmorden Mills Museum, in Montreal, New York State, Ottawa City Hall Art Gallery, and Drain Magazine. 
I have also guest lectured at Carleton University, the University of Ottawa, and have been a sessional professor at Algonquin College. Prior to PDA Projects, I worked in commercial galleries such as Galerie LeRoyer (MTL), Galerie de Bellefeuille (MTL), and Galerie St-Laurent + Hill (OT). I am also an art consultant with Canada Council for the Arts.",13.0,0,"1 Campaign

The Marine Foundation  is  excited  to launch the creation of  a new living sculpture in the sea with  sculptor Toin Adams.  We  have been approached by Captain Norian Lamb who represents the Dangriga fisherfolk from the Long Caye region  in Belize to initiate a new underwater gallery commencing with the installation of the Belize Sea Goddess. 



A large   Marine Protected Area  has recently been set-up and terminated their traditional fishing rights  which means they have lost their entire livelihood almost overnight.  They understand the need for protected areas but the reality is, how do they  earn a living when  their only practical knowledge and experience is of the sea which is their only resource?

<div><br/></div>
<div>Hello, my name is Adrien C. Tucker. I've been making and selling paintings since 1995 when I was 19. My style is all over the board from portraits, to abstracts, to landscapes and cartoons. <br/>
</div>
<p>I have set up my campaign to raise money for me to take a couple weeks off of my week to week job and post 500 of my original paintings on Etsy.com. I would also like to use the funds to promote my Etsy.com <a href=""https://www.etsy.com/ACTuckerArt"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.etsy.com/shop/ACTuckerArt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">page</a>, my <a href=""http://www.AdrienCTucker.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>, and my facebook <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ACTuckerArt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">art page</a>. </p>
<p>This would be huge! I never seem to have the time and energy needed to photograph my art, edit the photos, and post them to Etsy.com along with descriptions etc. Having 500 more paintings for sale should help free up some time to actually make new art instead of house painting 40 - 60 hours a week! I really hope this jumpstarts my career and my life in a wonderfully new direction.</p>
<h2><b><br/></b></h2>
<h2><b>Contributions</b></h2>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<p>I am hoping to raise $2,000. <br/></p>
</div><div>
<p>Two hundred dollars will go to update my <a href=""http://www.AdrienCTucker.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>. I would like to add 85 new pictures and a bio.</p>
<p>Two hundred dollars will go towards promoting my <a href=""http://www.AdrienCTucker.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a>, my facebook <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ACTuckerArt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">art page</a>, and my Etsy.com <a href=""https://www.etsy.com/ACTuckerArt"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.etsy.com/shop/ACTuckerArt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">page</a>. </p>
<p>Each listing on Etsy.com costs twenty cents, so one hundred dollars will go toward that. </p>
<p>Five hundred dollars will go to shipping out perks, which I estimate about $5 each for shipping one hundred perks. </p>
<p>One thousand dollars will go toward my living expenses for the two weeks it will take me to achieve my goal. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2><b>Perks!</b></h2>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<p>My perks are great! For donating only $20 you will receive an original Hatguy painting on canvas that I make just for you! My hatguy character, that has been around since 1995, is well loved by my art fans and friends alike. </p>
<p>If by some chance I don't make my goal of $2,000, your contribution will certainly still go towards my posting art, promoting, etc. Everyone that contributes will get the perk that I promise, no matter how few contribute. I appreciate every one of you. Thanks. :)</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h2>For me</h2>
<div><br/></div> <p>As an artist, I have a great desire for my work to be seen, touched, and tasted. This campaign does just that, and in many ways. If I am able to start making money from the hundreds of paintings that I already have, I will be able to make more new paintings and keep the flow going. That's all I want. I am very excited for the work I have not made yet. I hope you enjoy my art and also look forward to what will come from my studio in the future. </p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h2>Risks or Challenges</h2>
<div><br/></div>
<div>There's nothing too risky nor too challenging in this particular campaign. The only thing that will prevent me from achieving my goal would be an awful sickness, injury , or my death. I will take lots of photos, edit and crop them in photoshop so that they accurately portray the art. Then I will post these paintings on Etsy.com. A good friend does my website and helps out with promotion. I will promote my facebook page and add photos to it myself.</div> <p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Forwarding my campaign on social media will be a great big help. Please venture to check out my website, <a href=""http://www.AdrienCTucker.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">AdrienCTucker.com</a>, my Etsy.com <a href=""https://www.etsy.com/ACTuckerArt"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""https://www.etsy.com/shop/ACTuckerArt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">page</a>, and my facebook <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/ACTuckerArt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">art page</a>. </div>
<div>Another great way to help would be to buy my art. I have around 50 works on Etsy.com right now! Thank you so so much. :)</div>

I have set up my campaign to raise money for me to take a couple weeks off of my week to week job and post 500 of my original paintings on Etsy.com. I would also like to use the funds to promote my Etsy.com page, my website, and my facebook art page. 
This would be huge! I never seem to have the time and energy needed to photograph my art, edit the photos, and post them to Etsy.com along with descriptions etc. Having 500 more paintings for sale should help free up some time to actually make new art instead of house painting 40 - 60 hours a week! I really hope this jumpstarts my career and my life in a wonderfully new direction.

Contributions

I am hoping to raise $2,000. 

Two hundred dollars will go to update my website. I would like to add 85 new pictures and a bio.
Two hundred dollars will go towards promoting my website, my facebook art page, and my Etsy.com page. 
Each listing on Etsy.com costs twenty cents, so one hundred dollars will go toward that. 
Five hundred dollars will go to shipping out perks, which I estimate about $5 each for shipping one hundred perks. 
One thousand dollars will go toward my living expenses for the two weeks it will take me to achieve my goal. 

Perks!

My perks are great! For donating only $20 you will receive an original Hatguy painting on canvas that I make just for you! My hatguy character, that has been around since 1995, is well loved by my art fans and friends alike. 
If by some chance I don't make my goal of $2,000, your contribution will certainly still go towards my posting art, promoting, etc. Everyone that contributes will get the perk that I promise, no matter how few contribute. I appreciate every one of you. Thanks. :)
   For me
 As an artist, I have a great desire for my work to be seen, touched, and tasted. This campaign does just that, and in many ways. If I am able to start making money from the hundreds of paintings that I already have, I will be able to make more new paintings and keep the flow going. That's all I want. I am very excited for the work I have not made yet. I hope you enjoy my art and also look forward to what will come from my studio in the future.    
Risks or Challenges

There's nothing too risky nor too challenging in this particular campaign. The only thing that will prevent me from achieving my goal would be an awful sickness, injury , or my death. I will take lots of photos, edit and crop them in photoshop so that they accurately portray the art. Then I will post these paintings on Etsy.com. A good friend does my website and helps out with promotion. I will promote my facebook page and add photos to it myself. 
    Other Ways You Can Help

Forwarding my campaign on social media will be a great big help. Please venture to check out my website, AdrienCTucker.com, my Etsy.com page, and my facebook art page. 
Another great way to help would be to buy my art. I have around 50 works on Etsy.com right now! Thank you so so much. :)

Sincerely,

<h3>Challenges</h3> <p>Although Dusty Visions has completed major projects before, this is Becca Priddy's first Burning Man project. This is also the first major project for a handful of volunteers working on Zooplankton. We have confidence that by working with Dusty Visions we will be guided in the right direction, gain knowledge that only people who have done this before know, and will ultimately succeed with this project. Our main challenges include </p> <ul> <li>Raising enough money to build Zooplankton! </li> <li>Programming Zooplankton's bioluminescence from scratch</li>
<li>Building a 20 foot structure with volunteers in four months</li>

The original drawing by Ernst Haeckel
I want to build and bring Zooplankton to life at Burning Man, as my own radical self expression.  Zooplankton will bring our community together, it will be a place of art to learn about science, to express ourselves artistically, and to see what others have discovered before us. It brings together art and science, as well as the past and the present. The Zooplankton team in Portland is already hard at work planning this project for all of us out there with a curious mind.""


Actual size Radiolarian (or what we're calling Zooplankton)
Zooplankton will be a 20 foot tall shady space for everyone to relax and enjoy. During the day Zooplankton will be a classroom where guests from the community will hold classes and workshops on science and other topics. By night the 150 acrylic spikes attached to the shell of Zooplankton will illuminate in a dazzling bioluminescent spectacle! Our programmer, Tony, has been hard at work developing a way to connect these spikes to a thermal camera that will be placed inside Zooplankton, sensing body heat.


Tony is developing the LEDs and acrylic spikes.
 The more people who join the fun inside, the more bizarre, interesting, and exciting the light show outside. Zooplankton will be a place to dance, meet new friends, and watch lights dance around a 100,000:1 scale replica of an ancient ocean organism.  

Why Does Zooplankton Cost So Much?
Although we are already working with the community to find tools to borrow for free, communal space to use, and the entire project is being built by volunteers, we still need to pay for all of the materials to build Zooplankton.
$3,400 will go towards building the structure:
 132 pieces of lumber and 53 pieces of plywood for the structure
Screws, nuts, bolts, drill bits, and other hardware
Gasoline for our generator at night all week so that the bioluminescence lighting can run all night long, and you can feast your eyes.
Industrial ground screws to keep Zooplankton secure to the ground 
Custom hardware and brackets
Pyrotechnics! Who doesn't love that?


$5,100 will go towards our awesome bioluminescence and lighting effects:

175 multi color LEDs with state-of-the-art ""nodes"" to make the light show fancy and fun!
Individually programmable LED strips to line the top of the beacon, to lure wanderers into Zooplankton, the way that an anglerfish lures prey! Nom.
Dust proofing, to keep our bioluminescence playa-free
An Arduino to control the spikes
Wiring to convert AC to DC power in several places on Zooplankton
The infrared camera to sense bodies inside! 
Over 300 feet of wiring so Zooplankton can get its groove on
175 clear acrylic spikes
   
What if we raise extra money?
We have some really great ideas for stretch goals, some of them include:
- Creating plexiglass windows to fill some Zooplankton's holes with Ernst Haeckel's art, laser etched onto them, lit by LEDs at night, and programmed with the rest of the LED spikes! 

- Displaying a microscope that projects images of real radiolarian fossils onto the walls inside of Zooplankton! Is that possible? Probably. Anything is possible!

We have held one small fundraiser in Portland in order to raise just enough funds to for our build lead, Landon, to buy materials to begin building parts of the top section of Zooplankton to take to our regional burn, but without this funding, we will not be able to bring Zooplankton to completion.

We are also applying for other art grants regionally in hopes to raise additional money we know that this project will require. We are doing our best to use every avenue possible to raise money. 
In addition, we are being fiscally sponsored by Dusty Visions, a local Burner-run 501(c)3 whose mission is to create and support community driven and Burner inspired art, events and education. We are honored to be sponsored by Dusty Visions, whose founding board members led Portland C.O.R.E projects in 2011 and 2012, as well as supported other art projects locally, on playa and in
ternationally. Teaming up with DV allows your donation to be tax deductible. 
Awesome perks include (but are not limited to):


This awesome bandana designed by Pantsless Santa! Available in multiple colors.


Nifty Zooplankton Stickers! Designed by Sarah Erratica! 
(one of multiple designs)



The infamous Burner Spirit Animal Poster by Sarah Erratica 
(one of three designs) 



A sweet Refrigerator magnet designed and made by hand by Sarah Erratica. Your choice of a round magnet with one of three Zooplankton logos, or a square magnet with your Burner Spirit Animal.


Challenges Although Dusty Visions has completed major projects before, this is Becca Priddy's first Burning Man project. This is also the first major project for a handful of volunteers working on Zooplankton. We have confidence that by working with Dusty Visions we will be guided in the right direction, gain knowledge that only people who have done this before know, and will ultimately succeed with this project. Our main challenges include   Raising enough money to build Zooplankton!  Programming Zooplankton's bioluminescence from scratch
Building a 20 foot structure with volunteers in four months
   
Other Ways You Can Help We understand that sometimes contributing can be difficult:  Every dollar helps! No amount is too small to help us get to Burning Man! Share this campaign with your friends, share on Facebook, Twitter, or other social media.    Thank you for helping Zooplankton make it home.",12.0,0,"3 Campaigns

In Duluth, she  was a member of Common Language, a non profit arts organization which created opportunities for artists to work together.  She later worked as the education coordinator at Franconia Sculpture Park.  Felicia went to graduate school in 2009 at the University of Maryland in the Washington DC area and upon graduating (MFA Studio Art 2012) moved to Germany to join her husband Alain Wozniak.

He is fluent in French, German and English.<br/></p>
<p>Since they met in 2010, Glidden and Wozniak have collaborated on three large projects: <a href=""https://vimeo.com/56585981"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">En Route</a>, video 2011 NY, <a href=""https://vimeo.com/128713190"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">ProjekTraum Wasserwerks</a>  live music and three channel video installation inside of a cement water reservoir 2014, CH, and most recently <a href=""https://vimeo.com/128713186"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Prometheus 2015</a>: symphony for light and video installation by Philippe Wozniak (Alain's oldest son,) with the Symphonic Jugendblasorchester Friedrichshafen, conducted by Wozniak, with a live video composition by  Glidden.

<h3>Why Jim Denomie?</h3>Jim Denomie (B 1955 Wisconisin, USA) is a painter who confronts issues about United States History and Native American History head on in his narrative paintings.  He uses humor, art history and contempory events as threads through brightly colored dreamscapes and landscapes.  His work widely collected and are included in these notable museums: <br/><ul>

<p>Felicia Glidden is interested in helping Denomie broaden his audience in Europe.

Jim Denomie's work is rooted in this American experience, in ways that reflect contemporary society and reach back into history with truth and humor. <br/></p>

The whole idea for the project began when Bethan created an Interactive Art installation for her final year degree show at University, using frequencies in water when listened to with the Body. Bethan was fascinated with the Creation principles of Fetal Listening, and how we initially come into our Life surrounded by water, listening within the Womb.</div>

</div>
<div>To re-create this immersive atmosphere of listening from within the body through water. We have been co-creating a Sonic journey, woven with sounds of the natural elements, the Human voice, Crystal singing bowls and other therapeutic instruments to compose an organic musical journey to take Listener's deep into the realm of embodied Sound. </div>

Is an interactive Underwater Sound Art installation where the audience is immersed in a Deep Listening experience of embodying Music in water.
Hello everyone!

We are Bethan and Gabe, who are Artists and Musicians hear to bring a magical underwater Listening experience to the world. The whole idea for the project began when Bethan created an Interactive Art installation for her final year degree show at University, using frequencies in water when listened to with the Body. Bethan was fascinated with the Creation principles of Fetal Listening, and how we initially come into our Life surrounded by water, listening within the Womb.



To re-create this immersive atmosphere of listening from within the body through water. We have been co-creating a Sonic journey, woven with sounds of the natural elements, the Human voice, Crystal singing bowls and other therapeutic instruments to compose an organic musical journey to take Listener's deep into the realm of embodied Sound. 



Our dream is to raise funds to purchase some Underwater speakers to make this water Sound-bath happen in physicality. We have everything else in place, the Music, the instruments, the bodies and the swimming pool space. Now all we need is this last piece of equipment to make this vision a reality!




We are raising the funds to purchase the Underwater speakers to put up this installation this coming September, under the natural Light of the Stars in an outdoor swimming pool. This first instalment will allow us to explore further into the realms of underwater sound, then we hope to create other interactive Live performances and Sound Art installations both in America and the UK.



By donating any amount to us, it will all go to purchasing the equipment to act as a platform for this life-long musical exploration to continue and expand into something beyond our dreams. I imagine one day to also bring this medium of underwater Listening to the process of Water Births, so when babies are born into the world, they can be born through the essence of Sound and Music. 
I feel like my life long exploration and background in both Visual Art and Music has been leading up to this project, and now its finally time for it to be born!



We are offering some great perks to give back to You if you feel guided to contribute, You can also own and listen to the album yourself once it has been recorded and send you an electronic copy of the Music. We are also offering some personal customised Art just for you from Bethan ! And a personal piece of Music composed just for you by Gabe! You can even have the opportunity to come and experience this for yourself and be immersed in the magical realm of underwater music.
Everything we raise hear will go 100% to the Speakers for the installation, we have already invested time and money in all the other instruments and equipment.



This project could go so far into the future and benefit the way in which we Listen as Human Beings - through the Body. The material of Sound in water is truly spectacular and an experience I wish everyone to feel for themselves - our core intention is to to expand the very Art form of our relationship with Sound and experience of Music.



We would be eternally grateful if you could support this Art and Sound project to make the magic happen and even if you are just interested in the type of Music and Art we create, please do get in touch and share this project with your friends!
Thank You so Much!

<p>My name is Eric van Straaten. Full color 3D printing is my trade.

Also during the finishing of a sculpture a lot may go wrong. Pieces may break, the surface may be damaged, etc. You can imagine the production cost sometimes surmounts the sales price. If you could help me to get my own printer, I will be able to reduce those costs.</span></p><p>This is why I am looking for sponsors to help me to get a full color 3D printer of my own.

<p><b>MORE INFORMATION ABOUT ME AND THE CAMPAIGN</b></p>
<hr/>
<p><b>Biography</b></p>
<p>Born in 1969 I grew up and am still living and working in Haarlem, The Netherlands. I used to sculpt my detailed statues by hand. Six years ago I began to master the art of 3D modelling. Within a year I was able to produce my first 3D printed sculpture. Soon my work was picked up by several known galleries and collectors. At this very moment my sculptures are in high demand with galleries in the Netherlands, Belgium, France, USA and Japan. To my great honor, my sculpture ‘Pelican’ is featured on the ‘Lucas Museum of Narrative Art’s’ website as a representative example of work that will be exhibited as a part of the collection. Check it out here: <a href=""http://www.lucasmuseum.org/collection/category/digital-sculpture-201.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.lucasmuseum.org/collection/category/digital-sculpture-01.html</a></p>

<p><i>The largest 3D printed sculpture I ever made, assembled in 15 parts</i></p>
<hr/>
<p><b>About the full color 3D printer</b></p>
<p>The only 3D printer that in my opinion is able to produce beautiful 3D prints in full color, is the ProJet by 3D Systems (formerly known as ZCorp). The printer large enough for my sculptures, is the ProJet 650. This machine is not a DIY desktop printer, but an industrial machine that does not come cheap. Even a second hand one, suitable for my sculptures, would cost around $40.000. Furthermore the print materials are very expensive. Color and binder cartridges are about $1.000 and the machine has to be fed with print medium (a kind of plaster) at a cost of $6.000. Cartridges and print medium have to be resupplied  regularly as you start printing.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466457905/printprocess01_klhumc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>The 3D printer I want to buy, underneath this mountain of powder is one of my 3D printed sculptures</i></p>
<hr/>
<p><b>Why the ProJet 650?</b></p>
<p>I believe there is no other technique that can achieve the level of hypersurrealism made possible in 3D computer modelling. Industrial 3D printing is the only technique that can be used to make full color digital models tangible, close to the original design. I aim for physical expressiveness in my sculptures, while preserving a certain digital feel. It has been said my sculptures contain a weirdly eroticized corporeality, although the models are completely virtual. Like Barbie, they will never be real human, nor will they be based on a real human. They are a complete figment of my imagination. Balancing on the edge of kitsch, the marzipan-like quality of the ProJet material resonates beautifully with the apparent innocence of the scenery.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466457931/printprocess02_fj49jk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>The software that feeds the printer. Here a model in parts called ""Leda"" is sent to the 3D printer</i></p>
<hr/>
<p><b>Why do I need your help?</b></p>
<p>Even though having a lot of opportunities to show my work, due to the very high production costs, I am still struggling as an artist. Each sculpture leaving my studio, has to be funded by myself. Because the ProJet is not always consistent in quality, it may happen that a sculpture has to be printed several times. Also during the finishing of a sculpture a lot may go wrong. Pieces may break, the surface may be damaged, etc. You can imagine the production cost sometimes surmounts the sales price. If you could help me to get my own printer, I will be able to reduce those costs because no third party is involved.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1466457948/printprocess03_bnjbrk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>After printing and cleaning, the 3D printed parts need to sit in a bath to make them water resistant and brighten the colors</i></p>
<hr/>
<p><b>Join the experience</b></p>

To make that experience a real one:  I have created a <a href=""http://ericvanstraaten.com/3d-print-helpdesk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Helpdesk</a> on my website, a (secret) place where you can ask 3D printing related questions.

<hr/>
<p><b>Risks and Challenges</b></p>
<p>To reach my goal, including the production costs for the perks of this crowdfunding campaign, I have estimated that I need around $60.000. This is a serious lot of money, but I am confident that I can bring this money to good use and it will provide me with the opportunity to further develop my work. As sponsor, you carry no risk at all: even if the campaign does not reach its target, you will receive the perks you have chosen. Any amount will help me, so do not hesitate to contribute!

I am in need of my own full color 3D printer to gain a higher degree of esthetical quality, as every artist in search of perfection.Even though having a lot of opportunities to show my work, due to the very high production costs, I am still struggling as an artist. Each sculpture leaving my studio, has to be funded by myself. Because the printer is not always consistent in quality, it may happen that a sculpture has to be printed several times. Also during the finishing of a sculpture a lot may go wrong. Pieces may break, the surface may be damaged, etc. You can imagine the production cost sometimes surmounts the sales price. If you could help me to get my own printer, I will be able to reduce those costs.This is why I am looking for sponsors to help me to get a full color 3D printer of my own. As a thank you for sponsors, I have created a range of limited editioned 3D printed figurines that can only be found in this campaign. For further information about the printer I need and why that costs $60.000, scroll down below the description of the perks.

WHAT DO YOU GET FOR YOUR SPONSORSHIP?Keep in mind that full color 3D printing at this level takes a lot longer than you would expect. Especially the post processing is time consuming as you can see in the video at the top of this page. Time will also be needed to get my own machine up and running. Even if I do not reach my goal, you will still receive the perk you ordered!

MORE INFORMATION ABOUT ME AND THE CAMPAIGN

Biography
Born in 1969 I grew up and am still living and working in Haarlem, The Netherlands. I used to sculpt my detailed statues by hand. Six years ago I began to master the art of 3D modelling. Within a year I was able to produce my first 3D printed sculpture. Soon my work was picked up by several known galleries and collectors. At this very moment my sculptures are in high demand with galleries in the Netherlands, Belgium, France, USA and Japan. To my great honor, my sculpture ‘Pelican’ is featured on the ‘Lucas Museum of Narrative Art’s’ website as a representative example of work that will be exhibited as a part of the collection. Check it out here: http://www.lucasmuseum.org/collection/category/digital-sculpture-01.html

The largest 3D printed sculpture I ever made, assembled in 15 parts

About the full color 3D printer
The only 3D printer that in my opinion is able to produce beautiful 3D prints in full color, is the ProJet by 3D Systems (formerly known as ZCorp). The printer large enough for my sculptures, is the ProJet 650. This machine is not a DIY desktop printer, but an industrial machine that does not come cheap. Even a second hand one, suitable for my sculptures, would cost around $40.000. Furthermore the print materials are very expensive. Color and binder cartridges are about $1.000 and the machine has to be fed with print medium (a kind of plaster) at a cost of $6.000. Cartridges and print medium have to be resupplied  regularly as you start printing.

The 3D printer I want to buy, underneath this mountain of powder is one of my 3D printed sculptures

Why the ProJet 650?
I believe there is no other technique that can achieve the level of hypersurrealism made possible in 3D computer modelling. Industrial 3D printing is the only technique that can be used to make full color digital models tangible, close to the original design. I aim for physical expressiveness in my sculptures, while preserving a certain digital feel. It has been said my sculptures contain a weirdly eroticized corporeality, although the models are completely virtual. Like Barbie, they will never be real human, nor will they be based on a real human. They are a complete figment of my imagination. Balancing on the edge of kitsch, the marzipan-like quality of the ProJet material resonates beautifully with the apparent innocence of the scenery.

The software that feeds the printer. Here a model in parts called ""Leda"" is sent to the 3D printer

Why do I need your help?
Even though having a lot of opportunities to show my work, due to the very high production costs, I am still struggling as an artist. Each sculpture leaving my studio, has to be funded by myself. Because the ProJet is not always consistent in quality, it may happen that a sculpture has to be printed several times. Also during the finishing of a sculpture a lot may go wrong. Pieces may break, the surface may be damaged, etc. You can imagine the production cost sometimes surmounts the sales price. If you could help me to get my own printer, I will be able to reduce those costs because no third party is involved.

After printing and cleaning, the 3D printed parts need to sit in a bath to make them water resistant and brighten the colors

Join the experience
To my knowledge, I am the only artist in the world working at this level of full color 3D printing. Your donorship would therefore be part of an unique experience! To make that experience a real one:  I have created a Helpdesk on my website, a (secret) place where you can ask 3D printing related questions. Having experimented and worked for 6 years, I have acquired a lot of knowhow, especially in making digital models 'print ready'.

Risks and Challenges
To reach my goal, including the production costs for the perks of this crowdfunding campaign, I have estimated that I need around $60.000. This is a serious lot of money, but I am confident that I can bring this money to good use and it will provide me with the opportunity to further develop my work. As sponsor, you carry no risk at all: even if the campaign does not reach its target, you will receive the perks you have chosen. Any amount will help me, so do not hesitate to contribute! Thank you in advance, Eric van Straaten.

The beaches surrounding the atolls are sinking due to erosion caused by waves and this is exacerbated by rising sea levels. In addition, because the sea level is rising on the islands, Tuvaluan must continually deal with their homes flooding, as well as soil salinisation. Soil salinisation is a problem because it is making it difficult to get clean drinking water and is harming crops as they cannot grow with the saltier water, and be forced to change their diet habits. As a result, the country is becoming more and more dependent on foreign imports.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467882160/j9rxhicinu1gxnlwgnxs.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467884886/eouymahasogqcjetej2t.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467884919/gz66clti2pxqmeglsv0e.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>Why should I contribute?</h3><p>This art project will help Tuvalu to face to threaten of sea level rising, and for other island nations too.

Huang,  is an artist and environmental advocate, a frequent traveler to Tuvalu and official representing Tuvalu nation in United Nations Frameworks Convention on Climate Change, Conference of Parties (UNFCCC COP) since 2012, and representing artist for Tuvalu Pavilion at Venice Biennale in 2013 and 2015. He has been working on eco art for very long time and seeking to rise environment awareness of current rapid rising of sea level treating the inhabitants of small pacific island nation of Tuvalu.  ""Year on year, the impacts of climate change are hard to see:air temperatures warming by a few tenths of a degree here, sea levels rising by a few millimeters there. This poses a challenge to the artists who tackle climate change - a challenge that Taiwan's Vincent J.F. Huang address steamrolling right over it...""---The Wall Street Journal""First New York, then other cities around the world. Now the Occupy movement has spread underwater and it doesn't even involve humans. Taiwanese artist Vincent J.F. Huang has created and installation that uses marine animals to examine the burgeoning protest movement. ""          ---Huffington Post""Tuvalu's entry for the Venice Art Biennale next week will see artist Vincent J. F. Huang raising awareness of the climate crisis engulfing the island with his massive oil pump interactive/slaughter machine. People fill up for ""petrol"" while simultaneously ""guillotining"" Barack Obama's head.""---The Independent""The tiny Pacific nation of Tuvalu this year has a presence at the Venice Biennale, intent on raising awareness abut the climate crisis threatening to engulf it. Tuvalu's Government has teamed up with Taiwanese artist Vincent J.F. Huang who uses dark humor to convey the nation's environmental messages.""---ABC TV NEWS""In addition to his artistic contribution to the conference, Huang is also an official delegate for the island nation of Tuvalu... Huang was drawn to the country because of what he saw as its tragic situation""a non-industrialised country that produces nearly zero carbon emissions would be perhaps the first to perish as a consequence of emissions... To further press home his message, Huang has arranged for animals 'to host a press conference' today at 1:30pm to convey their message to the human delegates at COP18/CMP8 Doha.""---Gulf TimesFor more coverages of Vincent please check the links below (at the end of this page).What are you going to do?Vincent’s aim is to planting 7000 mangrove trees at Funafala beach, where he will arrange the plants into QR code pattern with a web link to an environmental website for more relevant information.  Like 7,000 oaks by Joseph Beuys, so this project will not only promote awareness to a larger audiences as social sculpture but also at the same time will help to slow down soil erosion causes by raising sea level.Ice melt caused by a warming atmosphere is making sea levels rise, which will cause problems globally. When we believe this perhaps nowhere more acutely than the low-lying islands like Tuvalu, in fact there are at least 22 more lying island nations like Tuvalu and it influences 7 million people.  What happened to Tuvalu is what happens to our planet tomorrow. We are calling for your action to face the extreme weather together. Why Tuvalu? Is Tuvalu a country?Tuvalu is a island nation located in Pacific Ocean, it's a group of nine tiny islands in the South Pacific, locates between Hawaii and Australia, which won independence from the United Kingdom in 1978. It's population is less than 10,000. Five of the islands are coral atolls, the other four consist of land rising from the sea bed and it's threaten to engulf the nation.Recently, Tuvalu has gained significant media attention worldwide because its low-lying land is so susceptible to rising sea levels. The beaches surrounding the atolls are sinking due to erosion caused by waves and this is exacerbated by rising sea levels. In addition, because the sea level is rising on the islands, Tuvaluan must continually deal with their homes flooding, as well as soil salinisation. Soil salinisation is a problem because it is making it difficult to get clean drinking water and is harming crops as they cannot grow with the saltier water, and be forced to change their diet habits. As a result, the country is becoming more and more dependent on foreign imports.Why should I contribute?This art project will help Tuvalu to face to threaten of sea level rising, and for other island nations too. It’s a part of estimation for extreme weather.We humbly ask you join us for this eco-friendly event and please spread the words, share Tuvalu's story on your social media! Let’s work together on making our environment a better place, for a better future!Start it now!We aim to raise $30,000. Every $10 you donate we plant a Mangrove on the coast for you, and all the mangroves will be arrange to a QR code shape. To scan this QR code you will be lead to more relevant information about climate change. For more donation we are plant more mangroves surely. The more important thing is all the money you spend not only slow up the sea level rising, also help Tuvaluan to save their home.  Your contribution goes 100% to art materials, mangroves, logistic, transportation, insurance, and a documentary shooting equipment rental for the project. Everyone participating in the project with a commitment to the transformative power of eco art, to against climate change. Our team is so grateful for your contribution and support.Stories 紅樹林巨型QR code護岸 台藝術家巧思救吐瓦魯環境危機 水筆仔計畫籲正視吐瓦魯危機Giant barcode on Tuvalu to raise awareness about climateArtist to plant 7000 trees in TuvaluClimate art: Tuvalu plan for giant mangrove QR codeArtist Vincent J.F.

</div></div>","Help us make the pilgrimage to Burning Man 2016!Our Guild's art manifests in spectacle, performance, and the creation of beautiful portraits in wood, transformed by fire. We will be one of 28 workshop Guilds located on the central plaza, around ""The Turning Man"", following this year's Art Theme ""Da Vinci's Workshop"". Using chainsaws, we carve the portraits of patrons as they sit in a moop (matter-out-of-place) proof chamber on the ""chair of death"". In 15 minutes or less we render a likeness in a slab of wood. The sound and finesse of the chainsaw in the artist's hands is mesmerizing and a bit unnerving. 
The experience of the sitter/audience is mediated as they see their image being carved via the video stream from an action camera that the carver wears. They are watching and they are being watched.

<p>Marnie Freeman is a talented artist who is know as the ""Artist of Liberty®"" because the subject matter she is passionate about reflects the founding values of our great nation.  The election of Donald J. Trump as the 45th president was historic at many levels. Many never thought he would ever even have a chance, but he tapped into a core of supports who came out in force to win the White House and start a new chapter in the American story.</p>
<p>During the campaign the supporters of Trump/Pence ticket were likened to a ""basket of deplorables."" This became a rallying cry for many who were on the fence with their support. These supporters prayed for candidate Trump and turned out in record numbers with a desire to ""Make America Great Again"" as One Nation Under God. Now, they want to send a resounding message to President Trump: ""We are praying for you.""</p>
<p>For the first time Marnie Freeman is accepting a public commission to create a special painting that commemorates this historic election. Her painting is titled ""March of the Deplorables"". It will depict a line of supporters praying for and marching alongside President Trump and Vice President Pence on their journey to the White House. She will also include key figures who were instrumental in this historic victory such as Kellyanne Conway, Melania Trump, Ivanka Trump, Lt. General Flynn, Steve Bannon, Katrina Pierson and Karen Pence. Much like the campaign was targeted to giving a voice to the average American rather than the privileged few, this painting is being funded in the same way. By opening this up to the public more people can participate in this historic painting. The idea came from Lt. Colonel E. Ray Moore, a retired Army Chaplain. Colonel Moore asked Marnie to paint this to honor the men and women who made the 2016 victory happen. He felt that it should be ""commissioned by the people.""</p>
<p>Marnie plans to present this painting to President Trump and Vice President Pence when it is completed. She believes that it will be a cherished memento of what many believed was impossible.</p>

Launching in Spring 2018, the collection will sell online and from the atelier. I will be sourcing fabric from the best imported Italian wool and Japanese cotton.

I'm  a figurative sculptor. My passion to sculpt the human form led me to study at the Florence Academy of Art in Florence, Italy from 2006-2010.  For four years, I was immersed in sculpting, drawing, and studying the anatomy of the human figure.  Countless hours of training prepared me to express my inner visions through the medium of sculpture.</p><h3><strong>WHY THE MEAM MUSEUM IN BARCELONA, SPAIN?</strong></h3><p>The sculpture Spiritual Sisters participated in a three-month  exhibition called Figurativas 2015 at the Museu Europeu d’Art Modern (MEAM museum) in Barcelona, Spain.  Over 2,500 artists competed to have their artworks displayed in this beautiful venue in the Borne section of Barcelona, near the Picasso museum.  MEAM attracts thousands of international visitors each year. Having my sculpture in the permanent collection at MEAM will greatly increase the exposure of my art to a wide variety of individuals from around the world.  When I saw my sculpture in the museum for the opening ceremony of the exhibition, I realized that I had found a new and special home for Spiritual Sisters.</p><p>MEAM was created by restoring the old Gomis Palace and has been open to the public since 2006. Restoration and purchasing artworks to build a permanent art collection for the museum has been a very costly undertaking.</p><p>It's important to me that the sculpture is in a collection with other figurative artworks created by my contemporaries. The sculpture will be well maintained and available for many to appreciate now and in the future. Your contributions will help my artwork to be in a place where it can be seen by a large audience.</p><h3>FUNDING GOAL</h3><p><strong>My funding goal is $15,000</strong></p><p>My first Indiegogo campaign raised over $9,000.

</h3><p>The initial stages included making drawings and small clay composition sketches until I arrived at the final design. Next, I built the stand and armature, the structure that hoods the clay. The bulk of my creative time,  represents approximately 1,600 hours, was spent sculpting the two figures in clay. I worked with live models, and from imagination. I primarily worked with professional models and periodically had pregnant women pose to better portray the unique qualities of pregnancy.  The mold making process  was done by a professional mold maker.  The next  part is called chasing the wax, which is a preparation for the bronze casting. Once the bronze is cast, metal workers have a big job to weld, grind, hammer, and chase the metal in preparation for the patina. The patina is a chemical process in which oxidizes the bronze to give it the rich warm browns and light dusting of green.     <br/><br/>Here's a link to see some of the steps involved in the creative process  <a href=""https://vimeo.com/192282086"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://vimeo.com/192282086</a> .</p><p>In total it was a truly a wonderful experience and a labor of love and I hope you will be inspired to contribute.</p><h3>THE PERKS<br/>Please select a reward for your contribution</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493506462/gulaoyuw0xlyxwbhdgh9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><strong>BRONZE PORTRAIT</strong> on Black Belgian Marble base from Spiritual Sisters.

<p><strong>Project Summary</strong></p>
<p>Children of the Mist is a project that comes from two goals. The first is to document and record the Highland and Island communities, and the second is to affect change through art and its exhibition. By distributing and displaying the final product, we hope to raise awareness of the damaging effects of centralisation on these communities.</p>
<p>We will travel along the coast, stopping in small communities along the way, circling up through Sutherland, the Northern Isles and passing finally through the Western Isles and the west coast. We’ll be locating and staying in bothies, camping in the wild, and walking off-road, navigating through less explored regions. In these isolated places we’ll be knocking on doors, talking to communities, and photographing people in their natural environments, in the spirt of the American FSA photographers of the 1930s.</p>
<p>Our goals include compiling the photography and writing into a self-published book or zine, and exhibiting the works, as well as digitally distributing any short film(s) that we might make.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who Are We?</strong></p>
<p>We are Erasmus Mackenna and Theodore Wilkins-Lang, fellow artists and collaborators from Dundee who have been working together for the past year. Last year we both worked on separate projects which involved both fundraising and traveling. Theodore went to America (his homeland), to photograph the Republican Convention, raising money through IndieGoGo, and Erasmus walked on Skye and North Uist to raise money for Highland Hospice and research the history of the region. Children of the Mist would be our first major collaborative undertaking, following a series of short films made in Dundee.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Funding: Where is Your Money Going?</strong></p>
<p>We are raising £5000 for this project. The money will be split into several categories: travel, accommodation, supplies including food, film (the project will be shot of analogue film), and distribution costs (from developing the photos to printing a publication). We believe £5000 will cover these costs sufficiently. This amount will also give us the flexibility to invest more time in researching history, travelling, and diving deeper into the secrets of the communities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why Should I Donate?</strong></p>
<p>We believe that is incredibly important to bring the voices and the culture of the people of the Highlands &amp; Islands to a wider audience, namely the central belt of Scotland, through art. Due to centralisation, people are often left without true representation, forced to toil in silence. As we are both artists, we feel the best way we can help is to use our mediums of writing, spoken word, photography and cinema to raise awareness. You will be aiding our efforts as well as helping two upcoming artists with their first major work in collaboration.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>We are fully aware that not all of you reading this have the money to donate, even if you want to support us. If that is the case, sharing and spreading the word can have a massive impact.</p>

Children of the Mist is a project that comes from two goals. The first is to document and record the Highland and Island communities, and the second is to affect change through art and its exhibition. By distributing and displaying the final product, we hope to raise awareness of the damaging effects of centralisation on these communities.
We will travel along the coast, stopping in small communities along the way, circling up through Sutherland, the Northern Isles and passing finally through the Western Isles and the west coast.

Plata was conceived in January 2016 by Lady Zen, as a venue to support LGBTQ+ artists in San Miguel De Allende and throughout Mexico. The space, a 75 person capacity underground venue, has been transformed from dark, circus themed decor, to a colorfully lit, hip and welcoming venue that features live music, DJ's and producers, fashion, dance, drag shows, film, visual art, and much more. 


Lady Zen has been in the performing arts since the age of 7, holding a BA in Music Business and an MFA in Creative Writing. (www.theladyzen.com) She returned to San Miguel for the second time in November 2015 to perform and explore entrepreneurial opportunities. Her incredible talent as a vocalist and creative entity opened the doors to owning a venue in SMA. The community has received her with open arms, and it has always been her dream to own a performing arts venue. With the help of her fiancee, Lilia, and others, the first phase of opening the bar began in February 2016, with a grand opening the first week of March.



Plata's birth has been made possible by the investments of San Miguel residents and visitors, and these initial contributions have been a major kickstart in getting the space cleaned, painted, light renovations, promotion, staff training and stock. Our next phase of renovation and streamlining is crucial to establishing Plata as a part of the the SMA community as well as expanding our revenue streams and ensuring the stability of the business. Your contribution, however large or small, will help us take the venue up a notch so we can provide the experience we've envisioned for our patrons.

  
Our Current Goals We plan to raise 12,000 for this expansion project. We can accomplish the major needs of the venue with this amount, while we continue to grow into the space. The main reasons we are raising funds are:

To build out and soundproof the rear area of the venue. Currently, the back area of the space is a patio with a canvas awning, which leaks sound to our neighbors. We are working with interior designers and a contractor to maximize airflow & cooling, enclose and soundproof this area, as well as create a dressing room adjacent to the stage. This improvement will allow us to entertain our guests at an ideal volume without being a disturbance to the neighborhood, keep the space properly ventilated, and allow our performers a comfortable, private area to get ready.


To begin a major outreach and publicity campaign. So far, Plata's main promotion has been through word of mouth and Facebook. We have been amazed at the response simply from these forms of advertising, but it is time to start investing in larger publicity channels. We need to begin reaching out to the residents of nearby cities such as Celaya, Queretaro, Guanajuato, Guadalajara, and Mexico City, to truly put Plata on the regional map.




To extend our hours. We are able to purchase the permits to extend our Friday and Saturday hours of operation until 2 AM. Up until now, we have had to close our doors at Midnight, exactly the time when most of our patrons want to come in for a drink. The extension will keep us open at the busiest time of the night, keeping the customers happy and helping our bottom line.




To complete the entryway. This includes signage, minor renovation, lighting, handrails, decor, and an area to promote upcoming shows. An update to this area will help us with visibility, create an entrance that will pull in more people walking by, and give a great first impression of the venue.


In the case we don't reach our goal, we will invest first into the renovations for the rear of the building, and the remaining improvements will come afterward, with an emphasis on publicity and the extension of hours.
   The Impact 
Plata is the only dedicated LGBTQ+ venue in San Miguel, and it is also unique in its focus on performance, creativity and other artforms coming directly from this community in San Miguel. The value of a space like this for individuals who are often marginalized goes beyond monetary worth. Plata is an investment in the gay community, a place for creatives to connect and create, and a home for those who don't always have a place to go. 

The feedback from our patrons has been unbelievably incredible. Gay, straight, trans, queer, and everyone in between, they all feel at home when they walk in. So many patrons comment on how we have created something so different in San Miguel, and how happy they are to be here and support its growth. This is the greatest and most humbling feeling, to be welcomed and treasured for what we are doing. 
The community element of Plata is extremely important to us, and this is why we have partnered with Colectivo 41, (www.colectivo41.org) the first and only youth-led, community-based organization for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and intersex (LGBTQI) people in San Miguel de Allende. Their mission and values align with ours, and we have created programming to support them in creating safe spaces and activism for LGBTQ rights in Mexico. This is why we created Plata, and the impact of having this gathering place is monumental for the LGBTQ community here.
   The Nitty Gritty  We've had our fair share of challenges, from leaking pipes, to noise complaints, and delay of construction. The two of us have been working hard for 3 months straight, cleaning, painting, renovating, as well as building the social media, booking performances, seeking funding, and putting Plata on the map. We have done most of this on our own, with the help of some friends and volunteers along the way. 
This fundraising effort will help us get the proper systems and people in place to make Plata run more smoothly, and take some of the pressure off of us.  With every challenge, there has been a lesson and a opportunity for growth. We know what we need to move forward, and the investment that we've made into the space, of time, energy, love, commitment and positivity has given us the tools to make Plata a continued success.
   Every Bit of Energy Helps We know that it's not always possible to make a monetary contribution. But positive energy is a huge reason why we are here now, Without the support that we have had so far, Plata could have all the money in the world and still fail. 
Even if you are not able to donate, sharing this fundraiser, telling your friends, or just giving us some good vibes makes you a contributor.

Founded in 1947 by Russell Hartley, a dancer and designer with San Francisco Ballet, MP+D has served the arts community for nearly 7 decades. Our museum's collection covers 165 years of history on performance and theater design and includes a large number of original and unpublished materials. Last winter, with the financial help of the Institute of Museum and Library Services, we worked with a professional conservator to survey our 500-piece stage costume holdings. In the process, we re-discovered costumes that had not been seen since their arrival at MP+D. We also learned that 3/4 of the costumes were in need of preservation and conservation treatment(s) for a total cost of $75,000. Our campaign to preserve this precious collection begins now with a subset of 110 costumes. Reaching out to our community through Indiegogo gives us the exciting opportunity to inform the public about this important initiative, rally financial support for it, and get people personally involved in preserving our shared cultural heritage. The success of our immediate efforts depends on your generosity. Give today and make history an important part of our future! ""The costumes merit the investment and expense of appropriate conservation treatment, environmental mitigation and pest management, along with adequate archival and conservation-safe long and short-term storage housing,""  says textile conservator Elyse Rousseau. ""Implementing these goals will allow for better collection management, with easier safe handling practices for research and exhibition.""  Costumes unpacked during the assessment survey (2015)  Help us reach our $28,500 goal! Your donations will make it possible for us to perform time-sensitive mold and pest abatement and remediation on 110 costumes. These conservation treatments are done using proven scientific methods that require special equipment and need to be performed by skilled professionals. They include: 
professional CO2 Anoxia Oxygen Deprivation Ecapsulation and Dry Thermal Vacuuming Freezing ($25,000)
new archival storage and housing materials for long-term storage ($3000) 
retrieval/restocking fees from cold storage and delivery charges ($500)
  Winged ornamented black cape worn by Serge Oukrainsky in Dance Macabre (c. 1920s) Giving a new lease on life to 110 historically significant stage costumes is no small thing. It involves pulling large boxes out of cold storage, hiring a professional conservator with specialized skills and equipment, and time. The work would look like this: 1. The winged ornamented black cape worn by dance innovator Serge Oukrainsky in Dance Macabre, for example, would be one of 110 costumes pulled out of cold storage.  2. Our professional conservator would group the cape with a few other costumes based on like materials and dimensions. 3. She would individually vacuum-wrap and seal each group item in polypropylene plastic, and place them as a group in a freezing chamber at -20 degrees centigrade for 3 weeks. 4. Once out of the freezing chamber, she would unwrap each group item and place them still as a group in the anoxia chamber for oxygen deprivation for 3 - 5 weeks. 5. She would ensure that all insects or microbial species are abated and remedied before properly folding each costume using new archival grade materials and boxes.  6. She would repeat these same steps with the 100 and some other costumes. With your financial support, we are ready to do the unglamorous, dirty work so these costumes continue to shine in exhibitions, academic research, and the hearts and minds of history lovers for generations to come! We can achieve our goal quickly if all of you give. Even a small contribution of $5 or $10 can help. If a contribution of $10 is out of reach, then reach out to your social network and let people know about our campaign.

<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Who Am I and What Is an ArtMobile?</span><br/>
</h3></div><p>I am an art educator with many years of experience facilitating people of all ages in their journeys to express themselves visually, demonstrating how to use the tools and techniques of making art so they can release their creativity, regardless of their perceived level of talent. I believe that <strong>creative expression is very personal and needs only to benefit the creator</strong> - if Someone Else likes the outcome, so much the better - but it's <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/artisticaura/Home/the-classroom"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">the process of creating art</a> that is of the utmost importance.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p><p>The idea for the ArtMobile was conceived while I was a student pursuing my Art Education degree 15 years ago. There are many remote communities in <a href=""https://sites.google.com/site/artisticaura/Home/northern-arizona"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">northern Arizona</a> - small towns scattered over great distances throughout the entire area. Many of the residents cannot afford art lessons and art materials even if they were locally available.

<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""315"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/V1pxMcl-p9o"" width=""560""></iframe></div></div>","Who Am I and What Is an ArtMobile?
I am an art educator with many years of experience facilitating people of all ages in their journeys to express themselves visually, demonstrating how to use the tools and techniques of making art so they can release their creativity, regardless of their perceived level of talent. I believe that creative expression is very personal and needs only to benefit the creator - if Someone Else likes the outcome, so much the better - but it's the process of creating art that is of the utmost importance.The idea for the ArtMobile was conceived while I was a student pursuing my Art Education degree 15 years ago. There are many remote communities in northern Arizona - small towns scattered over great distances throughout the entire area. Many of the residents cannot afford art lessons and art materials even if they were locally available. So I thought, What if there was a way to bring art to people in need the same way that books are brought to those who cannot come to the library? Like a book mobile but for sharing art!There was no Indiegogo back then and I had no clue how to fund such an idea so I put it on the back burner of my mind, got my teaching certificate and became a public school art teacher. Many years later I participated in my first Burn and saw all the magnificent mutant vehicles. I was mesmerized by the variety of creative expression parading in front of me. These vehicles not only brought people out to the art of Burning Man - they were works of art in and of themselves! What a concept!And so - originally thought of as only a vehicle for carrying art supplies - my humble ArtMobile idea evolved into the project I'm presenting here.The ArtMobile is an interactive art experience gifting the opportunity to engage in creating artworks that will be displayed throughout the community before going home with the creators, modeling the Burning Man Principles everywhere it goes.Your contribution will help bring the opportunity to practice Radical Self-Expression to countless men, women, and children for many years to come. Everything I've done in my professional  life has been in preparation of  creating  this project. It is my dream, my life's purpose. I hope  you will support me in making it a reality.

$1,000 will attach frames to the exterior of the van, creating a unique Gallery for displaying participants' works of art.

$1,500 will light up the Gallery and Classroom for night viewing and dressing up for celebrations.

$1,500 will provide durable afternoon shade for ArtMobile participants.

$1,500 will purchase all art supplies and fuel needed for the duration of Burning Man 2016, where the ArtMobile will make its debut.
After the ArtMobile is up and running, I will be filing for 501(c)(3) non-profit status in order to raise on-going funding through grants. This will cost an additional $400 in filing fees.
Funds raised above and beyond these basic needs will be used to purchase additional art supplies and fuel so that the ArtMobile can continue serving the needs of people in remote communities.
Perks range from ArtMobile stickers and shwag to limited edition prints of an original painting inspired by my Burning Man experiences. Check them out!

And of course...be sure to find the ArtMobile on the playa and participate in creating some artwork of your own!

<p>In Lithuanian, ""BANDYTI"" is a verb meaning ""to try"". So a person, who TRIES (in Lithuanian - ""bando"") to think, create and act is a BANDIT (""banditas""). Therefore we are bandits and our movement is BANDITISM. That's where the BanditFest comes from.</p>
<p>The idea of BanditFest‘15 is to help young and unknown Lithuanian music makers to try, be encouraged  and present their music to those who are interested, want to discover new concepts of music, and try by themselves. We are striving to create<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> a unique opportunity in Lithuania to discover, get involved and participate in the creation process of a festival, which aims to cover various branches of art and invites all art enthusiasts as well as people and families that like spending their time in the right way to support young Lithuanian artists in an authentic historic environment. </span></p>

</div> <div> <h3>What Do We Need?</h3>
</div><div>
<div>We are very lucky to have such amazing artists perform at the festival only because they believe in this idea and are passionate instead of greedy, but we still have to provide them with a free ride there. So, we extremely need money to cover their transportation costs (500 Eur) as well as money to pay for the stage equipment (1200 Eur) and security (400 Eur). Of course there are other things, but these are the ones requiring the highest sums. The stage has to be payed for on the day of the event, but at least the fuel for the artists can be payed for a little bit later - that is why the campaign does not end with the event's date - we truly hope the initiative will not be ignored and You will help us bring the music and talents together!</div>

Although the festival is very young, it went great last year, is growing very fast and has a huge potential.

<div>As the festival is so young and only taking place for the second year, the possible partners do not trust its success yet as well as the audience does not rush to buy the tickets.

For now we only hope to be able to make the event as qualitative as possible with such little funds and not end up with debts. To avoid that we are trying hard to promote the event as widely and creative as we can to get as much tickets sold as possible, and to still attract at least some funding from the private companies.</div> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

a time where, one of us- Lillian- was personally experiencing what she would describe as a suffocating and claustrophobic feeling of uncertainty, fear and anxiety- a state we came to see here as ""a legal 'limbo'"".

Together, we became interested about how other people are having trouble with their right to stay in a foreign country (in the EU, especially) and if they also experience what we perceive to be Limbo. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">When talking to people about it, we came to notice </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">that waiting for </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">the legal means to stay or having the status of being 'undocumented’ creates a feeling of </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">in-betweenness </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">or stuckness due to the presence of this legal barrier and pressure.

to. I was puzzled about wanting to stay in Europe when I am actually Brazilian and was held with the expectation of going back although for the past 11 years I have lived outside of my 'home country'. From this, w</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;"">e have come to see nationality as an arbitrary concept.

About 1000 euros out of the 3,500 has been spent  for buying the tools and materials for building the outside of the installation such as the framework tent and its consisting fabric, thread and ropes. We also used some of that money to buy and test out the technical parts of the installation such as card readers and headphones.

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span><br/><p><span>So we already managed to raise some money, but they don’t fully cover our estimated costs of transportation, the technical parts, parts of the design and not yet paid costs from the work of collaborating specialists like, technicians, sound producers, visual artists, actors and photographers in our team (yes, surprisingly, artists need to eat too!). By helping us raise 1,500 euros you would more specifically help us attain the more technical parts of the installation such as projectors, lights, raspberry pi's, headphones.</span></p>
<p>In order to make the Limbo ID card activate to the corresponding audio-visual material, we will need the following for the electronic and technical parts, this would be a total estimate of 1,500 euros. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Projectors: 600 euros </p></li>
<li><p>Lights: 200 euros</p></li>
<li><p>Raspberry pi's: 105 euros</p></li>
<li><p>Headphones:  100 euros</p></li>
<li><p>Remaining card readers: 60 euros</p></li>
<li><p>Electricity and pieces (cables, wifi-transmitters, relais, etc) : 500</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, we are still working on some parts of the design of the installation itself, such as the roof, the floor and so on. This will cost us approximately 1,000 euros:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Floor: 200</p></li>
<li><p>Roof: 500</p></li>
<li><p>Boxes for the RFID-readers: 150</p></li>
<li><p>Finishing touch (ribbons, rope, weights on the bottom, pegs and guy rope for bad weather): 150</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We try to work as much as possible with volunteers, but for some parts, we really need professionals, and they need to be paid, these are approximately 1000 euros:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Technical services: 200-300 euros</p></li>
<li><p>Sound editors: 100-200 euros</p></li>
<li><p>Voiceover actors: 100-200 euros</p></li>
<li><p>Audio-visual artists: 100-200 euros</p></li>
<li><p>Extras- transportation costs, re-contribution of interviews, locations: 300 euros</p></li>

         Limbo Citizen is... an interactive 'walkthrough' documentary to be located in the city center of Utrecht- starting as of the 1st of May in Utrecht's medieval cathedral, the Domkerk. In this real-life sized maze, you will find out about the story of four different migrants. An undocumented migrant from Ghana, an asylum-seeker from Syria, an economic migrant from Kenya and a student from India will bring you closer to the problems they encountered given their lack of an EU-member passport. Despite coming from completely different backgrounds, there is one thing in common in all their stories: after leaving their homes, they end up in a Limbo. This is, a transition phase in which the present is unsettled and the coming future uncertain. 







Hello, here is Pien and Lillian- together we are the creators of Limbo Citizen.


 Our project looks forward in giving you, the user, a taste of what it is like to be in the vacuum of four migrants. What we want is to give citizens the opportunity to experience the 'limbo' situation of someone else. This is, a state that is caused by the pressure to obtain a legal status once seeking to stay in a foreign country. Imagine feeling stuck. Have you ever thought about the limitations of being born in circumstances where it seems you were given the ""wrong""  nationality? 
Hmm...


Holding the status of EU citizenship comes with so many privileges that most of the time it is hard to notice they are there even once you have it. Besides the normal bureaucracy here and there, travelling and moving abroad for work or study for most EU passport holders is not much of a problem- at least not between the borders of minimum 26 countries within the Schengen area plus another 20 more countries in the rest of the world when travelling as a tourist (see the map below).
(Image retrieved from Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_European_Union_citizens)

However, this is not the same for everyone. A person from outside of the EU, let's say, Bolivia, who comes to study in an EU country, for instance, the Netherlands, will most likely have a hard time trying to figure out how to stay for a longer time in the Netherlands after she/he has completed her/his studies. Once the study period is over, one is expected to leave the EU as soon as possible. For some, when this expiry date of stay is approaching this sometimes may take on a sudden and hasted decision such as applying  for a new study program to extend a residence permit. In some cases, this may even take on a drastic decision such as marrying an EU national in order to obtain the rights of civil union. Regardless the choice, waiting for the legal measures of stay, creates a time of uncertainty, frustration and anxiety for the individual. In this situation, one sees how civil freedoms of education, work, mobility and settlement are limited depending on one’s national citizenship. 

Idea

The idea for this project came from
a time where, one of us- Lillian- was personally experiencing what she would describe as a suffocating and claustrophobic feeling of uncertainty, fear and anxiety- a state we came to see here as ""a legal 'limbo'"". Heavy-headed, she watched time flash by as she frantically searched for alternatives to continue her stay. That is her, a few months ago...weighted down by her limbo-head.  



After
finishing my studies in the Netherlands, as a Brazilian national I was expected to
leave the Netherlands given that my study permit was about to expire. This was a
very stressful and frustrating time for me as I did not want to leave. Seeing me go through this experience made Pien aware of her privileges as a Dutch citizen.

Together, we became interested about how other people are having trouble with their right to stay in a foreign country (in the EU, especially) and if they also experience what we perceive to be Limbo. When talking to people about it, we came to notice that waiting for the legal means to stay or having the status of being 'undocumented’ creates a feeling of in-betweenness or stuckness due to the presence of this legal barrier and pressure. We came to realize that once in this situation one comes to feel out of place as one's sense of belonging becomes lost. Due to my growing up as a “third-culture” kid, I sometimes felt lost about which culture I belonged and so, that complicated my perception towards the country I was seemingly expected to go back
to. I was puzzled about wanting to stay in Europe when I am actually Brazilian and was held with the expectation of going back although for the past 11 years I have lived outside of my 'home country'. From this, we have come to see nationality as an arbitrary concept. In terms of nation borders and citizenship, the enforcement and implications of these concepts can make an individual feel not only unworthy or misplaced but also feel high levels of stress and anxiety given all the bureaucratic problems and constant uncertainty about the future. 

However, such limits of national bureaucracy and citizenship often remain invisible until you have to deal with it...

That's why,
we want to create Limbo Citizen in hope to offer citizens of the world, a surprising possibility to become aware and hopefully reflect on their privileges or, lack of it, given their citizen status. By doing this, we also hope to question the status of nationality and citizen rights in today's time of globalization and migration. Now,you may be asking how...

An open and free interactive installation located in the city center of Utrecht.

Each line in the map represents a limbo story and pathway the user will be assigned when entering Limbo Citizen. On the right side, you can see its size on real-life measurements.  Once inside this 6m x 5m size and 3.5 meters high maze, you are expected to find your way by the access of your Limbo ID card, thus, unlocking bit by bit of your given character's story.


But, we need you.

So far we managed to raise altogether a budget of 3,500 euros. This was thankfully to the aid of 1000 euros prize-money from Camera Interactiva competition program (on the 10th of December, 2015) and 2,500 euros from Gemeente Utrecht's cultural subsidy  funds awarded just recently (on the 7th of March, 2016). About 1000 euros out of the 3,500 has been spent  for buying the tools and materials for building the outside of the installation such as the framework tent and its consisting fabric, thread and ropes. We also used some of that money to buy and test out the technical parts of the installation such as card readers and headphones. Below you can see some of our progress, with one of the limbo pathways on the process of being built and tested.





At the moment we are in the process of finishing up with the cutting and sewing of the fabrics for the rest of the other limbo pathways in the installation, as well as preparing all of the audio-visual material such as filming, video editing, writing up the final parts of the script, as well as carrying out audio recordings and processing it. 


So we already managed to raise some money, but they don’t fully cover our estimated costs of transportation, the technical parts, parts of the design and not yet paid costs from the work of collaborating specialists like, technicians, sound producers, visual artists, actors and photographers in our team (yes, surprisingly, artists need to eat too!). By helping us raise 1,500 euros you would more specifically help us attain the more technical parts of the installation such as projectors, lights, raspberry pi's, headphones.
In order to make the Limbo ID card activate to the corresponding audio-visual material, we will need the following for the electronic and technical parts, this would be a total estimate of 1,500 euros. These include:

Projectors: 600 euros 
Lights: 200 euros
Raspberry pi's: 105 euros
Headphones:  100 euros
Remaining card readers: 60 euros
Electricity and pieces (cables, wifi-transmitters, relais, etc) : 500

Furthermore, we are still working on some parts of the design of the installation itself, such as the roof, the floor and so on. This will cost us approximately 1,000 euros:

Floor: 200
Roof: 500
Boxes for the RFID-readers: 150
Finishing touch (ribbons, rope, weights on the bottom, pegs and guy rope for bad weather): 150

We try to work as much as possible with volunteers, but for some parts, we really need professionals, and they need to be paid, these are approximately 1000 euros:

Technical services: 200-300 euros
Sound editors: 100-200 euros
Voiceover actors: 100-200 euros
Audio-visual artists: 100-200 euros
Extras- transportation costs, re-contribution of interviews, locations: 300 euros

So a contribution would really help us reach that extra mile! In case you cannot, it would be great if you could show your support by spreading the word amongst yours friends and sharing this page on social media. 



And lastly (oh finally!),


We would like to thank you for making it until the end while reading through this lengthy campaign! We know it's long, but good ideas take some time. We hope it was worthy of yours too though and also to see you next time, in 'limbo'.",17.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">VAN STREET ART</h2>
<p align=""justify""><b>EN </b>Van Street Art is a consequence of this
attitude. It is mainly a great challenge. An Idea with great potential that I’d
love to see growing.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It all started on my visit to Art Basel,
world’s biggest street art event, in Miami, 2014. In this event I came across
with something I loved: a van that had an exposition in its interior.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I discussed this concept with some friends
and decided to create an event dedicated to Street Art. An event that aims to
be an international reference and highlight portuguese culture and its artists.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The objective of Van Street Art is to
reinvent the concept of a traditional art gallery, from a street concept to a
modern one, inside a van.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457357137/o98url55ltwou7dojbu3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: justify;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1457357177/obfzwsvwdvfqlqohvyqo.jpg"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>The main event will take place in Lisbon,

É uma ideia, um desafio,
com enorme potencial que eu quero trabalhar para que um dia consiga ganhar
asas.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Surge de uma viagem que fiz a Miami em 2014, onde tive o prazer de estar na
Art Basel, considerado o maior evento de arte de todo o mundo. Nesta viagem
reparei em algo único, uma carrinha com uma exposição no seu interior. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Em conversa com amigos resolvi criar um evento dedicado à Street Art. Um
evento que possa a vir a ser uma referencia a nível mundial, destacando
Portugal, a sua cultura e os seus artistas.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">O objetivo do VAN SREET ART, é modernizar uma galeria tradicional, galeria
de rua, para uma galeria moderna, dentro de uma carrinha. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Para isso iremos ter um main event, com a duração de 2 dias em Lisboa, no
Parque das Nações. 6 carrinhas vão receber uma exposição de 6 artistas de renome internacional.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Para além das exposições, podemos contar com pintura ao vivo, workshops,
música e muita arte!</p>
<p>Entre os artistas confirmados destacam-se:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">MISTER DHEO, da cidade do Porto. Já conta com
dois records do Guiness e com muitas obras espalhadas por todo o mundo. <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">PARIZ ONE, da cidade de Lisboa, foi dos
primeiros artistas portugueses a ter um seu nome em diversos países. As suas
obras estão espalhadas um pouco por todo o mundo. Está atualmente envolvido em
projetos Europeus de requalificação de espaços urbanos.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">SMILE, da cidade de Odivelas. Um dos artistas
que faz híper realismo em Portugal. No seu percurso a nível de artista, tenta
sempre criar projetos para dar uma visibilidade à street art nacional. Conta
também com alguns trabalhos na Europa. <br/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Mas ter só este fim de semana dedicado à Street
Art, não fazia sentido e para isso criei o VAN STREET ART ROADSHOW onde após o main
event iremos circular durante 4 meses pela cidade de Lisboa mostrar o resumo do
nosso evento. Numa primeira fase em zonas centrais da cidade e numa segunda vamos
a escolas secundárias mostrar aos mais novos o que a Street Art tem de bom.</p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><br/></p>

EN Hi, I’m Miguel Martins, a.k.a. Edis One, my artistic name. Since 2007
I’ve been working on street art. When I started on Graffiti I never thought I
could make a profession out of it, but today I have the chance to say that I

Most of what I’ve done lately has been focused
on changing the perception people have about street art.
One of the projects that made me prouder
was MUDAR LISBOA, a project I launched where we wrapped public objects with cellophane.
We wanted to call peoples attention to our monuments and it had a great impact
both with media and public in general.
With graffiti I’ve had some great
experiences and some not so great, that made me grow as a person as well as an
artist, and from which I’ve learned that life’s short and we have to be true to
ourselves and fight for our goals.
PT Olá, o meu nome é Miguel Martins mas na minha profissão sou conhecido por Edis
One. Desde de 2007 que estou ligado ao mundo da street art e hoje posso dizer
que vivo daquilo que mais gosto!
Já criei vários projetos relacionados com
Street Art e a maior parte das minhas iniciativas têm o objetivo de ajudar a
credibilizar esta forma de arte em Portugal. 
Um dos projetos que criei com maior impacto
foi “A MUDAR LISBOA”, que passou por chamar a atenção dos habitantes da cidade
para objetos públicos, embrulhando-os com celofane. O projeto teve um enorme e
inesperado impacto quer ao nível da comunicação social quer das pessoas em
geral.
Com o graffiti já vivi várias experiencias e passei por diversos obstáculos
que me fizeram crescer bastante como pessoa e como artista. Aprendi que a vida
é curta e que temos que lutar e acreditar nas ideias que temos.
VAN STREET ART
EN Van Street Art is a consequence of this
attitude. It is mainly a great challenge. An Idea with great potential that I’d
love to see growing.
It all started on my visit to Art Basel,
world’s biggest street art event, in Miami, 2014. In this event I came across
with something I loved: a van that had an exposition in its interior.
I discussed this concept with some friends
and decided to create an event dedicated to Street Art. An event that aims to
be an international reference and highlight portuguese culture and its artists.
The objective of Van Street Art is to
reinvent the concept of a traditional art gallery, from a street concept to a
modern one, inside a van.The main event will take place in Lisbon,
during 2 days, in Parque das Nações. 6 vans will host 6 of the best street
artists expositions. The event will have live painting,
workshops, a DJ set and of course lots of street art.

The main artists will be:
MISTER DHEO, from Porto, has already two Guinness
Records and many works around the world.PARIZ ONE, from Lisboa, is one of the most
international portuguese artists. His work is spread all around the world. At
this moment he is involved in European projects of urban space requalification.SMILE, from Odivelas, on of the most
representative artists of híper realism, in Portugal. Smile has been always
focused on visibility to portuguese street art, although he has already several
works around Europe.The other three artists are still blocked. It will be a surprise!But Van Street Art is much more than a 2
days event. It wouldn’t make sense to have art inside a van and keep it parked.
So I thought of a roadshow where, during 4 months, we will showcase the
event  in Lisbon, in a first moment in
iconic city spots, and in a second moment in secondary schools, where we will also
demonstrate to kids why street art should be treated with care and respect.PT O VAN STREET ART é uma consequência desta atitude. É uma ideia, um desafio,
com enorme potencial que eu quero trabalhar para que um dia consiga ganhar
asas.
Surge de uma viagem que fiz a Miami em 2014, onde tive o prazer de estar na
Art Basel, considerado o maior evento de arte de todo o mundo. Nesta viagem
reparei em algo único, uma carrinha com uma exposição no seu interior. 
Em conversa com amigos resolvi criar um evento dedicado à Street Art. Um
evento que possa a vir a ser uma referencia a nível mundial, destacando
Portugal, a sua cultura e os seus artistas.
O objetivo do VAN SREET ART, é modernizar uma galeria tradicional, galeria
de rua, para uma galeria moderna, dentro de uma carrinha. 
Para isso iremos ter um main event, com a duração de 2 dias em Lisboa, no
Parque das Nações. 6 carrinhas vão receber uma exposição de 6 artistas de renome internacional.
Para além das exposições, podemos contar com pintura ao vivo, workshops,
música e muita arte!
Entre os artistas confirmados destacam-se:
MISTER DHEO, da cidade do Porto. Já conta com
dois records do Guiness e com muitas obras espalhadas por todo o mundo. 
PARIZ ONE, da cidade de Lisboa, foi dos
primeiros artistas portugueses a ter um seu nome em diversos países. As suas
obras estão espalhadas um pouco por todo o mundo. Está atualmente envolvido em
projetos Europeus de requalificação de espaços urbanos.
SMILE, da cidade de Odivelas. Um dos artistas
que faz híper realismo em Portugal. No seu percurso a nível de artista, tenta
sempre criar projetos para dar uma visibilidade à street art nacional. Conta
também com alguns trabalhos na Europa. 
Mas ter só este fim de semana dedicado à Street
Art, não fazia sentido e para isso criei o VAN STREET ART ROADSHOW onde após o main
event iremos circular durante 4 meses pela cidade de Lisboa mostrar o resumo do
nosso evento. Numa primeira fase em zonas centrais da cidade e numa segunda vamos
a escolas secundárias mostrar aos mais novos o que a Street Art tem de bom.
YOUR HELP

EN Gather support for Street Art events in
Portugal is not an easy task! We’ve already knocked on many doors but found
most of them closed. But as I said before, I believe in my work and specially
in the potential of this project.
With your help we will make Van Street Art a reality! But please don’t
look at it as an event like many others. Van Street Art is a window to street
art in general. A first step to take street art to the higher ground it already
deserves! 
PT Mas arranjar apoios para a criação de eventos relacionados com a Street Art em Portugal não é tarefa fácil! Batemos a
muitas portas e encontrámos a maioria fechadas mas acredito naquilo que faço e
acredito no poder que este projeto poderá ter a nível cultural.

Com a vossa ajuda vamos fazer do Van Street
Art uma realidade. Gostava que não vissem isto como um simples evento, mas como
um claro apoio a uma cultura que está a crescer cada vez mais. Um primeiro
passo para levar a Street Art ao lugar de destaque que já merece!

The theme of the residency is <b>NEO FUTURE</b>. We’ll create a series of short films entitled ""Love Letters to Earth"" revolving around the premise of a woman’s life reorganizing itself in the wake of moving to Mars. Humans failed Earth and are colonizing the red planet. As her body acclimates to the new planet, her thoughts and feelings split between the two celestial bodies. She writes love letters to the dead planet and experiments with her body as an extension of both planets. She engages in integration rituals and recalls rituals she’d done, or wishes she’d done, on Earth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Arteles offers a unique, remote, creative environment in the Finnish countryside, far from city life. What better place to visually represent an idealized version of Earth?!

<p>
</p><p>In our work together, there’s a clear thread of failure, surrender, collapse, celestial bodies, poetry, and resilience. Sara and Holly both studied poetry at the university level, and are attracted to Ecopoetry: poetry with a strong ecological emphasis or message, often confronting disaster, the difficulty of urban reality, and mapping patterns of micro systems (e.g. evolutionary biology) reflected in macro systems (e.g. innovation systems such as Google). All these points excite us! We are incredibly eager to begin work on Love Letters to Earth, as the project embodies the continuation, synthesis, and evolution of our previous work together.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This project is a milestone in our careers as artists--in scope, size, and structure. We’ve worked individually the past years to make connections, expand our networks, and gain international recognition as artists. We wish to join our resources to create this new work, and bring it back to our home of Chicago. The final result of the project will be a series of short films which we will show in Chicago and also be submitted to traveling film festivals around the world.

</p><p>This project aims to address the individual and collective concerns for the planet, as well as illustrate our emotional connection to those concerns. Many, many, people carry with them un-metabolized grief for our currently distressed planet. This project uses Butoh, a Japanese postmodern dance, dealing with themes of suffering, impermanence, and transformation and Glitch Aesthetic, a digital art revolving around themes of failure, error, and collapse. We hope this project will guide people towards confronting that grief and sitting with it, leading them more into the present moment, rather than looking to the future for hope.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We’re also interested in exploring queer narratives through Science Fiction/Butoh movement and highlighting intersections of queerness, feminism, and the “othering” of bodies. Queerness is a non-binary identity, existing in opposition to the framework of conventional norms. Our work together investigates the underworld, in-between spaces, and the reassembling of beauty through destruction. We hope our work speaks to queer folks, who so very often are left out of the conversation when talking about what comes next for humanity.</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">Breakdown of Funding</span><br/></p><p>Camera (<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Canon EOS 70D DSLR Camera with 135 mm Lens)</span>- $1500</p><p>Residency-$1583</p><p>2 Flights to Helsinki from Chicago-$1900</p><p>Cost of living in Finland for 4 weeks for 2 people-$800</p><p>The total cost of the residency comes in at well over our goal of $5k, but this is the minimum we need to create the work!

<p>Ahoy!
My name is Shameema Dharsey and I hail from sunny Cape Town, South Africa.</p>
<p>I’m 34, I
have two cats, Fluffy and Wobbles, who I love dearly. I adore sushi, warm
beverages, and all the colors of the rainbow. I’m a passionate artist and
illustrator, earning my living by communicating ideas, telling stories with
images, creating memorable characters and worlds and making people
experience emotion through my art.</p>
<p>I’ve been
freelancing now for four years, and while working from home has been tough, it
has been very rewarding emotionally, albeit a bit difficult financially. Yet, I
was still surviving. I could pay the rent, I could purchase food for my cats, I
could very, very occasionally buy sushi and I could afford fuel to see my
friends. However, the longer I worked, the more the expenses piled up and every
year seemed tougher than the last. In my first year as a freelancer,  I was diagnosed with a
chronic condition for which the medication prescribed is a pretty penny. The third year,
my cat Heksie was tragically killed by a car and I truly learnt the meaning of
loss. One might think ‘oh, it’s just a cat’, but she was my friend and

MY STORY:  





Ahoy!
My name is Shameema Dharsey and I hail from sunny Cape Town, South Africa.
I’m 34, I
have two cats, Fluffy and Wobbles, who I love dearly. I adore sushi, warm
beverages, and all the colors of the rainbow. I’m a passionate artist and
illustrator, earning my living by communicating ideas, telling stories with
images, creating memorable characters and worlds and making people
experience emotion through my art.
I’ve been
freelancing now for four years, and while working from home has been tough, it
has been very rewarding emotionally, albeit a bit difficult financially. Yet, I
was still surviving. I could pay the rent, I could purchase food for my cats, I
could very, very occasionally buy sushi and I could afford fuel to see my
friends. However, the longer I worked, the more the expenses piled up and every
year seemed tougher than the last. In my first year as a freelancer,  I was diagnosed with a
chronic condition for which the medication prescribed is a pretty penny. The third year,
my cat Heksie was tragically killed by a car and I truly learnt the meaning of
loss. One might think ‘oh, it’s just a cat’, but she was my friend and
companion and had carved out a home deep in my heart. That same year, seven hospital
visits culminated in me being cut from heart to belly button, losing a kidney
and being diagnosed with a bizarre and rare auto immune disease which I am still being
treated for. I fought the good fight and with the support
of my family still managed to eke out a living using my given (and much worked
for) talent for creating unique artwork. 
Over the past
four years, my bread and butter has been doing illustration work for the textbook publishing industry.
Every year I had a more or less steady supply of textbooks and readers to illustrate
so I could afford to live and continue being an artist and illustrator.
Last year our
local government education department decided to end textbook submissions for the next
five years. No submissions = no work. No work = no money. No money = no Life.
I was
determined to make my art career work for me,as I knew it was my passion and what I am destined to do in life. And then my brother struck upon the idea of doing an adult coloring book. The idea immediately resonated with me, and I decided to dedicate some of my time (when not looking for work), to illustrating something special and different - a book that would stand out from the norm.



ABOUT THE
BOOK: 



Sham’s
Flight of Fancy, contains my heart and soul. Not only do I see it as a means to
earn money and survive, but I also see it as part of my Legacy. I don’t have
kids. I don’t know what I can leave this world. So if I can leave a little
something that makes the world a happier, sunnier place, I can rest easy.
Therefore, I decided that each page would have a bit of wisdom, advice,
inspiration or motivation that someone could color in, and paste on their wall,
giving it their own color and mark of personality.

I chose
animals because I’m rather fond of the natural world, and besides who doesn’t
like pandas? I also noticed that other animal adult coloring books always
portrayed animals in a terribly serious manner. I also  feel strongly that even though you may be an adult, it is important to keep a sense
of humor and have fun with life.
Hedgehog - Tea Makes Everything Better
I made the
book as quirky, fun, and warm as I could, and at the end of the day I believe
it is some of the best work I have done, and by far the most enjoyable artwork to
create. My hope is that after you have colored in these illustrations, you will
end up feeling better than you did before you started.

<p>My name is Mary Annabel Tan and I am an artist.  It took a long time for me to embrace my gifts.
</p>
<p>During my youth, I loved creating things and when someone was
hurt, I would make things for them to cheer them up.  When people asked me what I wanted to be when
I grow up, I would always say “I want to be an artist!” and guess what their
response would be?  “Artists don’t make
any money,” and I believed them for a very long time.  Further on, I become a single mother and went
through several vocations that were neither emotionally fulfilling nor financially sustainable.  </p>
<p>Now, I have finally realised that art can bring healing and hope
into our society.  Living without art is
like living without colours or love.  It
was a wakeup call for me as well as a calling which I have suppressed for a
good 10 years. Now is the time for me to act and let it flourish. I am using my
gift to bring smiles to the world and I believe everything will become brighter
when we can smile at any given moment.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>Many things have happened in
my life and I have gone from hope to fear, joy to sadness, longing and
disappointment, anger and bliss, love and hate….  And I have learn to choose what my heart
desires over choosing short term gains. The thoughts and whispers are like
falling in love all over again, creating butterflies in my stomach and looking
at life through rose tinted glasses.  </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1450619626/a4xjlbavnwxw2ervakmn.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p>I now

During my youth, I loved creating things and when someone was
hurt, I would make things for them to cheer them up.  When people asked me what I wanted to be when
I grow up, I would always say “I want to be an artist!” and guess what their
response would be?  “Artists don’t make
any money,” and I believed them for a very long time.  Further on, I become a single mother and went
through several vocations that were neither emotionally fulfilling nor financially sustainable.  
Now, I have finally realised that art can bring healing and hope
into our society.  Living without art is
like living without colours or love.  It
was a wakeup call for me as well as a calling which I have suppressed for a
good 10 years. Now is the time for me to act and let it flourish. I am using my
gift to bring smiles to the world and I believe everything will become brighter
when we can smile at any given moment.
Many things have happened in
my life and I have gone from hope to fear, joy to sadness, longing and
disappointment, anger and bliss, love and hate….  And I have learn to choose what my heart
desires over choosing short term gains. The thoughts and whispers are like
falling in love all over again, creating butterflies in my stomach and looking
at life through rose tinted glasses.  I now
embrace my art as my true calling and I am going to inspire others to create
through my creations.
When I started creating my “Hope Dolls” back
in 2014, I had a vision of creating large scale figures that can sit in the
midst of a garden.  My hope as an
aspiring artist was to have my own exhibition in 2016! 
With my passion, love
and soulful creation, I will revamp my website, explore and explore new online art markets like Artsy and participate in local Art Markets like The
Local People. Hopefully, I can go
to various part of the world to showcase my creations.
Part of my growth as a
professional artist and entrepreneur includes applications for research grants,
residencies and fellowships to further my education and broaden my experiences.I have been teaching
both adults and children in public events and small groups.  My future plan is to conduct larger classes for
schools and corporate. This will includes having my own studio and having a
team of aspiring artists with me to teach and mentor others along the way.  I am looking at contributing back to the
communities by creating large installations to raise funds annually for charities.
My long terms goal is
to be able to travel and create large installations for various communities around
the world.

“Talk
to me, I am listening” 
Trying out the various position to bring our different emotions of my Art.
I have been creating
all my smaller figurines using Polymer Clay. 
I have also been experimenting using Terracotta, Raku and also air dry
clay to create larger figures. The result are not ideal.  I have heard many good things about ceramics
and was thinking of studying in NAFA and last month I found a retreat being
offered by an Artist teaching us how to make large figurative sculptures using
ceramics. And it was like “Yes, this is what I’ve been searching for!”  This is why I set up this campaign to rise funds so that I can
go to Ubud for 2 to 3 weeks and learn from him. 
This retreat will make my dream come true both in creating large
figurative sculptures and also improving my skill as an artist.
I am truly grateful
and appreciative of your support in this journey to live out my dream,
fulfilling my potential and contributing to make our world a happier place.Thank you for looking
at my perks. I have listed many perks here for you to contribute in any way you
can!  All perks comes with an original
piece of my creation and I hope it will bring a smile to your face.  
“Droplets - Hello world!”All gifters will be acknowledged in my website and later in my 1st exhibition’s brochure.
When I reach my goal of US$6,000, all gifters will receive email
updates of my work in progress during the retreat.
Most perks will be delivered between March to May 2016.  For perks which comes with my original Artwork during the retreat will be delivered between April to May 2016.All perks will comes with a step by step tutorial writeup for creating your own droplets.
If for any reason you
are unable to contribute financially, I would also appreciate any shares on
social media, twitter, email or word of mouth. 
Do tell you friends, followers or if you know of anyone who will love my
perks. Help me to spread my work.
When I hit and exceed
the USD6,000 mark, all the money will be used to fund my retreat to Ubud.  If not, the money will be used to fund my
local 1 year Certification in Ceramic Course with NAFA and part of it will be
invested in revamping my website and also to explore and expand new online art
markets like Artsy and participate in local Art Markets like The
Local People.

In Singapore, we have very limited art suppliers to buy
     our materials.  In case of an
     overwhelming demand on this project, I might face a problem of not being
     able to buy the materials locally which will result in a delay in shipping
     and I would seek your understanding. All updates will be communicated through
     either email or Facebook. Let’s keep our fingers crossed that nothing bad
     happens J
In case of natural disasters, like if Singapore were to
     sink (like Atlantis??)  Then it
     might takes 2 to 3 years for me to fulfil your order.",16.0,0,"1 Campaign
