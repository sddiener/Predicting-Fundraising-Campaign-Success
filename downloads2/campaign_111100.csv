<h3>Reading is Resistance: help Restless Books champion diversity, immigrant culture, global voices, and great books—when we need them most!</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.restlessbooks.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Restless Books</a> is a newly nonprofit, independent publisher devoted to stories that speak to us across linguistic and cultural borders. In a few short years, we’ve published celebrated English editions of eye-opening work from places as diverse as Cuba, Malaysia, Madagascar, Iceland, Pakistan, Brazil, the United Arab Emirates, Mexico, Russia, Israel, and many more. In 2015, we launched the <a href=""http://www.restlessbooks.com/prize-for-new-immigrant-writing/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Restless Books Prize for New Immigrant Writing</a> to celebrate the rich contributions to culture immigrants make. And now, at a time when anti-global, anti-diversity, anti-literary forces are growing, we are determined to resist—by amplifying voices that are suppressed or neglected and expanding our understanding of the world through fearless international publishing. Your help is essential in keeping the reading resistance strong!</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>We need your help to become a sustainable nonprofit</h3>
<p>At the turn of 2017, Restless solidified our longstanding commitment to immigrant culture and diverse global literature by becoming a nonprofit. That status allows us to make new connections among authors, readers, and patrons of the arts. It means we can prioritize literary excellence and our global ethos over the dictates of the market. Nonprofit funding, however, takes time to develop, and in the meantime, we need your help.</p>
<p>Many of our indie publishing heroes have found success under a nonprofit model, such as <a href=""https://www.graywolfpress.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Graywolf Press</a>, <a href=""http://thenewpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The New Press</a>, <a href=""https://archipelagobooks.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Archipelago Books</a>, and <a href=""http://coffeehousepress.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Coffee House Press</a>. These publishers have cyclical fundraising through government and corporate grants, foundation support, and individual donors. Restless is now incorporated as a nonprofit at the state level and we are awaiting 501(c)3 status from the IRS, which will allow us to apply for more grants and accept tax-deductible gifts. To tide us over during the four to six months the application takes to process, we’ve turned to Indiegogo to reach readers directly and sidestep the red tape while our own fundraising cycle kicks into gear.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Your support will make a real impact!</h3>
<p>Your contribution will support phenomenal <a href=""http://www.restlessbooks.com/authors"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">international authors and translators</a> and help them connect them with readers eager to hear their voices. You'll benefit some exciting new and ongoing projects as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuing the <a href=""http://www.restlessbooks.com/prize-for-new-immigrant-writing"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Restless Books Prize for New Immigrant Writing</a>
</li>
<li>Expanding our series of <a href=""http://www.restlessbooks.com/the-face"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Face</a>, <a href=""http://www.restlessbooks.com/classics"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Restless Classics</a>, and international <a href=""http://www.restlessbooks.com/cuban-science-fiction/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">science fiction</a>
</li>
<li>Extending our line of <a href=""http://www.restlessbooks.com/jewish-literature/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">international Jewish literature</a>
</li>
<li>Launching our new imprint of international books for young readers, <a href=""http://www.restlessbooks.com/yonder"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Yonder</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of the last time you discovered something wonderful, surprising, eye-opening, or even life-changing on the page. You can help recreate that experience for countless others by helping Restless Books thrive. Come on and join the reading resistance!</p>

On the indie scale, even books that sell out their print runs end up breaking even. With nonprofit funding, we can ensure authors, translators, and staff are properly compensated, and we can continue to take editorial risks and publish creatively and ambitiously. </span></p>

<h3>What you get</h3>
<p>In addition to earning our undying gratitude and the tremendous feeling of supporting international authors and translators, every supporter of our Indiegogo campaign will get a shout-out on a special page of our website. And we've got some other fun ways of saying thank you....</p>

</div></div>","Reading is Resistance: help Restless Books champion diversity, immigrant culture, global voices, and great books—when we need them most!
Restless Books is a newly nonprofit, independent publisher devoted to stories that speak to us across linguistic and cultural borders. In a few short years, we’ve published celebrated English editions of eye-opening work from places as diverse as Cuba, Malaysia, Madagascar, Iceland, Pakistan, Brazil, the United Arab Emirates, Mexico, Russia, Israel, and many more. In 2015, we launched the Restless Books Prize for New Immigrant Writing to celebrate the rich contributions to culture immigrants make. And now, at a time when anti-global, anti-diversity, anti-literary forces are growing, we are determined to resist—by amplifying voices that are suppressed or neglected and expanding our understanding of the world through fearless international publishing. Your help is essential in keeping the reading resistance strong!
 

 
We need your help to become a sustainable nonprofit
At the turn of 2017, Restless solidified our longstanding commitment to immigrant culture and diverse global literature by becoming a nonprofit. That status allows us to make new connections among authors, readers, and patrons of the arts. It means we can prioritize literary excellence and our global ethos over the dictates of the market. Nonprofit funding, however, takes time to develop, and in the meantime, we need your help.
Many of our indie publishing heroes have found success under a nonprofit model, such as Graywolf Press, The New Press, Archipelago Books, and Coffee House Press. These publishers have cyclical fundraising through government and corporate grants, foundation support, and individual donors. Restless is now incorporated as a nonprofit at the state level and we are awaiting 501(c)3 status from the IRS, which will allow us to apply for more grants and accept tax-deductible gifts. To tide us over during the four to six months the application takes to process, we’ve turned to Indiegogo to reach readers directly and sidestep the red tape while our own fundraising cycle kicks into gear.  
 
Your support will make a real impact!
Your contribution will support phenomenal international authors and translators and help them connect them with readers eager to hear their voices. You'll benefit some exciting new and ongoing projects as well:

Continuing the Restless Books Prize for New Immigrant Writing

Expanding our series of The Face, Restless Classics, and international science fiction

Extending our line of international Jewish literature

Launching our new imprint of international books for young readers, Yonder


Think of the last time you discovered something wonderful, surprising, eye-opening, or even life-changing on the page. You can help recreate that experience for countless others by helping Restless Books thrive. Come on and join the reading resistance!
 

The economics
Until we find the next Elena Ferrante, Roberto Bolaño, or Karl Ove Knausgaard, we're operating on a relatively small scale, which presents its own challenges. Smaller print runs are more expensive per-copy to produce and yield modest revenue. On the indie scale, even books that sell out their print runs end up breaking even. With nonprofit funding, we can ensure authors, translators, and staff are properly compensated, and we can continue to take editorial risks and publish creatively and ambitiously. 
 
What you get
In addition to earning our undying gratitude and the tremendous feeling of supporting international authors and translators, every supporter of our Indiegogo campaign will get a shout-out on a special page of our website. And we've got some other fun ways of saying thank you....

Yoram Kaniuk’s Between Life and Death was a finalist for the PEN Translation Prize
Deepak Unnikrishnan’s Temporary People was named a top-ten summer book club pick by the American Bookseller Association

Humans also have faults!But think for a moment, and ask yourself:""Do you want a uncontrollable person like the Donald in a powerful position like the US President?Do you want to give him the power over one of the largest and highest developed military in the world?Do you want to give him access to the nuclear arsenal and the nuclear weapon codes?Do you want to have a US president who offends each one he does not like?Do you want a person as US president who destroys decades of political and people`s work?Do you want an america where the racism and hating are growing day by day?""NOBODY can want this!!!50% of our team are not US citizen!But we want to take care that Donald does not enter the white house!Because this voting will have impacts for all nations around the world! Why the iDonald is more than a smartwatch ?The iDonald is not only a smartwatch and an APP.The iDonald is a message!A reach out for human rights!A sidestick walk to the offended people!A statement for respect and humanity!A Community which shares one Dream: ""STOP THE DONALD""!  Who creates the iDonald ?We are a team, friends, who comes from different places in the world!We are just a few of the millions of people around the world who are fighting and praying against Donald!We are pretty sure that when Donald enters the white house, after our campaign, we will never have to try to enter the united states of america, or try to launch a company there.Because the Donald will fight against all his enemies!But anyway: We can not sell our humanity, our minds or personality and put our hands in our pockets!The game is first over when it is over!

Sam Melville, 1970 Attica</p><p> </p></div>","Help get my most important book published. SummaryIn his book Days of Rage, historian Bryan Burrough called him, “the essential blueprint for almost every radical organization throughout the 1970s.” He was the first US radical to target large office buildings and he has been called a leader of the famous uprising at Attica.I simply called him ""Dad.""My name is Joshua Melville. I'm a professional writer of five industry trade books, over 100 published articles, award winning filmmaker, lecturer and artists' rights activist. Sam Melville was my father.Sam & Josh MelvilleIn 1969 he and his collective were the inspiration for the Weather Underground when they set off explosives in numerous New York City institutions with Vietnam War interests:
The Whitehall Army Induction Center
Major Banks
Standard Oil
Over a dozen others 
By design, no one was killed. These were protests.  Not attacks.  And the anti-war movement responded with applause.But the threat to the Establishment War Machine was undeniable.  In a effort to quash his campaign, a massive FBI manhunt was put in place to capture the man they labeled, ""the Mad Bomber.""Rather than be treated as a political prisoner, Sam Melville, an educated engineer, who helped design landmarks like Brooklyn City Hall and Lincoln Center was arrested, charged like a common criminal and sent to Attica State Penitentiary. There prisoners received one roll of toilet paper a month; one shower every ten days; and spent months in solitary, denied the right to speak with anyone from the outside world.Sam Melville arrestedAfter numerous petitions to New York’s Governor Nelson Rockefeller, on September 9th, 1971 Sam Melville, along with a group of inmates from the Nation of Islam, Young Lords and the Black Panthers, obliterated racial boundaries and united to lead Attica inmates into the biggest prison uprising in U.S. history.Attica State Prison uprising - 1971My father was killed when state troopers, armed with shotguns and rifles, lined the catwalks of Attica and fired down into the prison yard like shooting fish in a barrel.The Retaking of Attica 1971Rumors of my father’s assassination were born immediately, making Sam Melville a household name. A book of his correspondence, Letters from Attica, was published posthumously (and is still used by educators of prison reform); memorials were set up in his honor; noted leftist lawyer William Kunstler delivered his eulogy; Black Panthers guarded his remains at a three day memorial attended by radical royalty; children were named after him.To many on the Left, he was a revolutionary hero. To others on the Right, a misguided anarchist. But neither template jibed with the man I remember. In my 20s I became determined to learn everything I could about my father and to answer a single question…What could turn a gentle man,a musician and a poet,into a bomber?I got far more than I bargained for.After twenty-five years of personal research, I've uncovered never-before known facts about the birth of the Radical Left of the 1960s, the FBI’s efforts to quash the Peace Movement and the truth behind the bloody retaking of Attica State Penitentiary.I'm putting everything I've learned into my 6th book, American Timebomb so that now the public will also know the truth.This book will inspire compelling conversations in the media about:
What is the fundamental difference between radicalism and terrorism?
How do the children of radicals suffer for their parents’ choices?
Is the FBI culpable in the escalation of US radicalism/terrorism via their covert agent/provocateur program?
Was bloodshed at Attica necessary?

The project has only reached his stage with a ton of unselfish help from my friends and ex-colleagues from business. Their efforts ranged notably from capable ‘pro bono’ work in marketing and strategy to funding my manuscripts and art.My friends and I sincerely believe this project will enjoy great success! Now, with their funds exhausted, I need help from the wider public to break through with this project.See below what we offer... Please also read my own tragic story at the very end of this appeal.""Norbert Voss '13 Sensual Confessions’ is a creative, winning concept primed and ready for your funding: Entertaining, erotic tales illustrated by a contemporary artist working closely with an intuitive author to capture the true essence of what has passed, or what is destined to come to pass!Captured are true-life romantic episodes and experiences of so-called ‘Muses’, women that have opened their hearts, no, their very souls, and shared their sensual secrets with the author, Norbert Voss. These authentic records have been documented in his colorful, captivating, and rich writing style and are impatiently awaiting closer scrutiny by a wide audience. The tales are of varying length and erotic intensity. The ‘Muses' Comments’ at the end of the stories are both amusing and engaging, while the ‘Author’s Comments’ are quite insightful.All stories are illustrated by Hardy Laddey, a renowned German artist.Preview the small art sample contained in the image gallery above. View thefull complement of illustrations and enjoy the free sample chapter on 13sensusualconfessions.infoYou’re also warmly invited to visit the Author’s Page on Amazon here.  It’s not a niché market. It’s the mainstream: The Romantic-Erotica Genré commands over 40% market share of profitable publications.And ’13 Sensual Confessions’ is poised to occupy a respectable share within that abundant domain! Anonymous interviews with a 100-strong focus group were extremely encouraging. Indeed, most trial readers testified: They adore the book, both the words, and the art!Reader Testimonials are overwhelming:“The combination of Voss’ texts, Laddey’s pictures, and the Muses’ descriptions has an effect on women comparable to the effect of Viagra on men.” (Julianne Voss-Pamplin, Australia, the author´s 74-year-old mother)
“The troika of eyewitness reports, words and images, leaves the connoisseur alternating between feeling a state of speechlessness and being irresistibly breath taken.” (Joshua Kruse, USA, Member of the Focus Group, Homemaker, Teacher of his Homeschooled Kids) “The ’13 Sensual Confessions’ is a real appetizer and an inspiration for making one’s own fantasies evolve into realities.” (Anonymous, Member of the Focus Group) High praise indeed, which demands a thorough examination by lovers of the romantic-erotic genre.Do you remember ‘Picture Books’?Many focus group readers affirmed they share the author's love of illustrated books. Do you remember listening to your Kindergarten teacher reading to you? Do you remember when she turned the book around to show you and your classmates the colorful pictures? Wasn’t it magnetic? Would you now, as an adult, like to relive that magnetism? You can turn back time!Wrapped between the covers of ’13 Sensual Confessions’ is a fascinating ‘picture book’ for grown-ups.  Originally, only the hardcover, the 'Collector's Edition', was advance printed and tested. It is a very weighty book due to the exceptional quality of the pages.Our research clearly showed, while readers loved the book, more flexibility would provide for increased market success. Dividing the ‘Collection’ into two, lighter and less cumbersome 'Volumes' was the first logical amendment to the format.Strong recommendations from our test readers were to have the book made available electronically. This was not only due to reading convenience, but also, readers felt a stronger sense of privacy was needed when consuming ’13 Sensual Confessions’ on public transport.The so-called Unit Tree in the below figure demonstrates a product range to satisfy all preferences while paying tribute to all wallet sizes.  Immediate goals include publishing ’13 Sensual Confessions’ as follows:
As eBooks - divided into five Selections and the Volumes One and Two on November 1st, 2016;
As Paperback Editions - divided into Volume One and Two, in both in full-color and black & white (economy edition) on December 1st, 2016;
As the complete 550-page-plus ‘Collector’s Edition’ - in impeccable hardcover quality also on December 1st, 2016
 Short and Medium-term goals include:
Translating the complete series into German and subsequently launching the book on this absolutely key market for the erotic genre.
Completing the screenplay of '13 Sensual Confessions'.

After establishing consistent cashflow through sales, further translations will include Spanish, French, and Italian;
Thereafter, an expansion with translations to Japanese and Chinese is foreseen.
 Going Forward: 
A new set of stories for a 'Next Collection' by the Voss-Laddey Duo has been defined. To be commissioned after the successful launch of the first 'Collection';
Further publications with other exciting duos are presently in the advanced planning stages; 
Also, a  wide range of merchandise is certainly conceivable to benefit from the anticipated success ‘13 Sensual Confessions’.
 We believe we’re a strong, effective, efficient, and extremely creative group. Our individual track records speak volumes.The market is competitive. We’re extraordinarily competitive, too, though. We aren’t poled to lose. We love to win!We’re prepared! We have the products to be well represented in a highly competitive market. aMuse has a mission, and we have a plan.Could we fail? Yeah, failure is in play ~ as it always is. Is the aMuse Team infallible? What/who is? However, each of us has faced and beaten adversity: We are stronger for it. Your benevolent contribution will expedite a successful, global launch of this noteworthy product range potentially facilitating joy and enticing, memorable hours for lovers of the romantic-erotic genre. With your support, we’ll implement. All we need to win is you!The real challenge for self-publishers today is getting noticed in a true avalanche of eBooks and the creators need funding to energize efforts in this arena. With their own resources dried, the creators need a new seed to finance a breakthrough. To secure global exposure and expand the products into new languages, USD 100,000 is being sought for:
Financing the inventory of the first English print editions in both paperback and hardcover: 20,000 USD;
Strategic, international marketing of the eBooks and printed books on Amazon and various other popular eBook outlets and platforms in key markets: 30,000 USD;
Financing the German translation: 30,000 USD;
Launch & Marketing in Germany 10.000 USD;

<h2>Breaking the Code of Silence on Families &amp; Courts</h2>
<p>Family court issues are deeply emotional. Everyday millions of families are forced into a complicated legal system and forced to deal with deeply personal issues related to their sexual, financial, emotional and psychological issues. A world of ""he said- she said"" accusations clog family court files and courtrooms where lawyers, judges, CPAs, custody experts and court staff are witness to horrifying stories and private drama. Many stories of real abuse and harm are being  protected by a Code of Silence that fosters injustice.</p>
<p>Ex Parte is going to break the Code of Silence by  publish heart-wrenching stories, conducting shocking interviews and obtaining information from real family court files. Common-sense based editorials, reform advocate battles and academic input will provide coverage of America's Family Court System in a bold and  compelling way -- both in  print and with cutting-edge digital media.</p>

<h3>How my 30-Day Challenge became a book...</h3>
<p>Last fall, after 3 years in New York City, I decided to leave and pursue a quieter life elsewhere. To make the most of my last month in the city, I created a 30-Day Challenge for myself. I decided to do one thing everyday to celebrate my remaining time in the Big Apple.</p>
<p>Friends, family and even strangers followed me on social media, sending me suggestions, commenting on my posts, and cheering me on.</p>
<p>Less than a week in, my simple idea quickly blossomed into a carefully curated tour through the streets of New York City. There were ups and downs, successes and failures, and all sorts of surprises along the way.</p>
<p>In this book, I share what I saw, what I experienced, and what I learned.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Purpose and Perks</h3>
<p><i>Purpose of Campaign</i><br/>To avoid the wait time of going through the formal publishing process, I have decided to self-publish my book. The funds raised will cover the cost of printing 40 advanced reader copies and 300 first edition paperback copies.</p>
<p>At least 20 advanced reader copies will be distributed to individuals, who will give me feedback and suggestions.</p>
<p>The first edition copies will be distributed a number of ways. In addition to the signed copies that I send to you, the backers, the book will be available for sale directly through me and at independent bookstores. I also plan to ship copies to the organizations and businesses featured in the book. </p>
<p><i>Perks for my generous backers</i><br/>By adding your precious dollars to the kitty, you are saying, ""Yes, Janet, I'd read that book! And I'd tell my friends about it too! Get it done!""</p>
<p>In exchange for your vote of confidence, I'm offering a number of thank you gifts to fit a variety of budgets. (The more confident you are, the more you get!!)</p>
<h3>The Timeline...(When do I get my copy!?!?!)...</h3>
<p>I am aiming to have the advanced reader edition printed by March 1. This will allow for a 6-week revision period. I'll collect feedback, make adjustments and corrections, and have the final manuscript reviewed by a copy editor.</p>
<p>My goal is have the first editions in hand by the end of May 2018. This will be an optimum release date because with the warmer weather arriving (hopefully) it will be an ideal time to visit and explore the streets of New York. </p>
<p>It will also give me time to get it submitted to the Nantucket Book Festival, and have it on the shelves of bookshops and businesses in time for the tourist season.</p>
<h3>
<br/>Where the money goes...</h3>
<ul>
<li>$150 - Photography and artwork for the cover</li>
<li>$150 - Copy editing.</li>
<li>$600 Advanced Reader Edition - 40 copies at $15/copy</li>
<li>$3900 - First Edition of the book in paperback - 300 copies at $13/copy. </li>
<li>$125 - USB # (barcode for back of the book)</li>
<li>$200 - Shipping/Admin./Misc.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Getting across the finish line...</h3>
<p>This is my first venture into writing a book (gulp!) self-publishing (oh boy!) and selling a finished product I created from scratch (gasp!) I have no doubt getting The 30-Day Challenge: New York from word doc to book form will present as many twists and turns as the challenge itself. There are likely unknown factors that will come up along the way.</p>
<p>In order to set myself up for success, I will do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Honor the commitment I have made to you, my backers, by maintaining my timeline as much as humanly possible, so you get your perks in a timely fashion.</li>
<li>Consult with other writers, specifically those who have self-published.</li>
<li>Be realistic about how much time I have available to work on the book</li>
<li>Thoroughly research costs and pricing to keep start-up costs at a minimum.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>FREE ways to back me?</h3>
<p>If you are tight on cash, but still want to give me your vote of ""YES"" for the book. Here are a few ways you can help, that cost nothing, and are extremely valuable...</p>
<ul>
<li>Share this link on your facebook page and social media.</li>
<li>Tell your friends about my soon-to-be-released book.</li>
<li>Agree to read the Advanced Reader Edition and give feedback.</li>
<li>Volunteer your time to help me package and ship books.</li>
</ul>
</div><p>I am so grateful for any and every contribution. Thank you for your support in sharing my story with the world!</p></div>","How my 30-Day Challenge became a book...

In this book, I share what I saw, what I experienced, and what I learned.

Purpose and Perks
Purpose of CampaignTo avoid the wait time of going through the formal publishing process, I have decided to self-publish my book. The funds raised will cover the cost of printing 40 advanced reader copies and 300 first edition paperback copies.
At least 20 advanced reader copies will be distributed to individuals, who will give me feedback and suggestions.
The first edition copies will be distributed a number of ways. In addition to the signed copies that I send to you, the backers, the book will be available for sale directly through me and at independent bookstores. I also plan to ship copies to the organizations and businesses featured in the book. 
Perks for my generous backersBy adding your precious dollars to the kitty, you are saying, ""Yes, Janet, I'd read that book! And I'd tell my friends about it too! Get it done!""
In exchange for your vote of confidence, I'm offering a number of thank you gifts to fit a variety of budgets. (The more confident you are, the more you get!!)
The Timeline...(When do I get my copy!?!?!)...
I am aiming to have the advanced reader edition printed by March 1. This will allow for a 6-week revision period. I'll collect feedback, make adjustments and corrections, and have the final manuscript reviewed by a copy editor.
My goal is have the first editions in hand by the end of May 2018. This will be an optimum release date because with the warmer weather arriving (hopefully) it will be an ideal time to visit and explore the streets of New York. 
It will also give me time to get it submitted to the Nantucket Book Festival, and have it on the shelves of bookshops and businesses in time for the tourist season.

Where the money goes...

$150 - Photography and artwork for the cover
$150 - Copy editing.
$600 Advanced Reader Edition - 40 copies at $15/copy
$3900 - First Edition of the book in paperback - 300 copies at $13/copy. 
$125 - USB # (barcode for back of the book)
$200 - Shipping/Admin./Misc.


Getting across the finish line...
This is my first venture into writing a book (gulp!) self-publishing (oh boy!) and selling a finished product I created from scratch (gasp!) I have no doubt getting The 30-Day Challenge: New York from word doc to book form will present as many twists and turns as the challenge itself. There are likely unknown factors that will come up along the way.
In order to set myself up for success, I will do the following:

Honor the commitment I have made to you, my backers, by maintaining my timeline as much as humanly possible, so you get your perks in a timely fashion.
Consult with other writers, specifically those who have self-published.
Be realistic about how much time I have available to work on the book
Thoroughly research costs and pricing to keep start-up costs at a minimum.


FREE ways to back me?
If you are tight on cash, but still want to give me your vote of ""YES"" for the book. Here are a few ways you can help, that cost nothing, and are extremely valuable...

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>La Storia</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Ero uno studente di 26 anni</strong>, e la mia vita è cambiata nel momento in cui ho ricevuto la notizia che mio fratello si sarebbe unito ad un ordine di monaci sconosciuto, in un luogo sperduto nel Sud dell’India. All'improvviso si è innescato un processo senza precedenti con un turbinio di domande, che mi ha portato a riconoscere la presenza di una forma di sofferenza nascosta dentro di me: può sembrare un paradosso, ma è stata la cosa migliore che mi sia accaduta nella vita.</p>
<p>Spinto in una nuova dimensione di scoperta interiore, sono diventato un marinaio del dolore, l'architetto invisibile del mio pellegrinaggio da Santiago (Cile), a Los Angeles (CA), a Singapore, per finire a Valeggio sul Mincio (VR). Durante 14 anni ho viaggiato in India e in Messico, pieno di domande, cercando risposte. Ero ossessionato dal tema del Risveglio.</p>
<p> </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596608081/elnqmmg2ukbw73rj4pg9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<p><strong>All'età di 38 anni </strong>la vita ha martellato piano piano nel mio cervello e inciso nel mio cuore, con la benedizione della paternità, le risposte che avevo cercato e parzialmente scoperto negli anni precedenti. Tutte quelle aspettative e quella ricerca senza fine sono svanite come foglie secche, spegnendo ogni domanda e conflitto interiore: ero in pace con me stesso... questa è la storia che racconta questo mio primo Libro: <i><strong>Il Viaggio di un Padre alla Scoperta Di Se Stesso.</strong></i></p>
<p>Per “ascoltare e vedere” profondamente il bambino a cui ""dovremmo insegnare"", dobbiamo prima ascoltare e guardare noi stessi. A quel punto, loro, senza pretese, iniziano ad insegnarci e guidarci, aiutandoci a scoprire chi siamo veramente.</p>
<p>“Ti vedo figlio mio, perché prima ho guardato me stesso”...</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">La Visione  </h2>
<p>Il mio sogno, per questo libro, è quello di <strong><i>aiutare tanti altri genitor</i></strong>i <strong><i>come me</i></strong> a trovare quella verità interiore che consente di dissolvere la sofferenza personale, quel sottile conflitto interiore, che ci portiamo avanti come un fardello invisibile, di generazione in generazione, avvicinandoci, con delicatezza e umiltà, al modo di sperimentare del bambino. </p>
<p>Il mondo ha bisogno di un cambiamento URGENTE e vedo questa emergenza sanitaria solo come un promemoria disperato della natura che ci chiede uno STOP. Fare una pausa e rallentare un attimo la nostra corsa sfrenata. </p>
<p>Possiamo solo creare un mondo, allo stesso modo in cui ci relazioniamo con noi stessi. Quando il mondo crolla fuori, c’è un bambino che piange dentro.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Chi sono</h2>
<p>Il mio nome è Daniel Bravo, sono un padre di 48 anni. Ho studiato Economia e sono nato a Santiago (Cile), attualmente vivo a Valeggio sul Mincio in provincia di Verona. Ho un figlio di 10 anni che mi ha ispirato e infuso il coraggio di scrivere questo libro. E’ un modo di onorarlo e ringraziarlo per tutto quello che ho imparato grazie a lui. </p>
<p>Anche se da 10 anni lavoro come consulente nel campo dell’energia,  condividere le mie esperienze con “la Verità” come ricercatore spirituale e padre è la mia vocazione. </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Sul Libro</h2>
<p><strong>Il libro consta di 200 pagine circa e si sviluppa in 7 parti con circa 60 capitoli. </strong>In modo colloquiale, narra diversi momenti della mia vita, intrecciando episodi dell'infanzia, ai primi anni quando ho cominciato la mia ricerca interiore assiemi ai monaci a momenti della mia paternità, tessendo una storia che parla di risveglio della percezione, di come sanare le nostre ferite emotive, di genitorialità autentica e “dell’arte del disimparare"", come forze motrici dell'avventura della vita interiore di un padre.</p>
<p>Il libro ci mostra una mappa, con un percorso per genitori interessati all’Auto-consapevolezza.  È un invito a ridefinire il modo in cui ci poniamo di fronte alla Vita. Ma per farlo, dobbiamo riformulare il modo in cui vediamo noi stessi.  Quando ci immaginiamo come individui indipendenti, separati dal resto, il mondo sembra e si sente come una realtà separata, facendo così precipitare la nostra esistenza in una storia di desideri poco utili e paure infinite. Una tale esperienza influenza profondamente la nostra genitorialità e la risposta che otteniamo dalla vita attraverso i nostri figli.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Per pubblicare questo libro in modo indipendente, ho individuato un <strong>obiettivo iniziale di 3.800</strong> euro per la versione in italiano, per coprire i costi di stampa e marketing di circa <strong>500 copie</strong>.

<p>Questo importo mi consentirebbe di pubblicare come <strong>minimo 500 copie</strong> e di semplificare molti lavori di editing, formattazione, traduzione, stampa e marketing, realizzazione del sito, nonché di realizzare una versione per ebook, tutte cose che sto facendo da solo, contento, ma con un po’ di fatica.

<p> </p>
<p><i>""Il libro è la storia del lungo viaggio alla scoperta di sé dell'autore che gli permette di avere questo sguardo rinnovato sull'essere padre... Ti vedo, figlio, perché prima ho visto me stesso""</i>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">Claudia C. Garese, mamma e imprenditrice.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>""Un viaggio indietro nel tempo verso quei momenti felici in cui portavo nel mio corpo la stella viaggiante il cui nome è Camila che ora ha 22 anni. Leggere questo meraviglioso libro mi ha fatto sentire profondamente l'importanza di essere veri con noi stessi e quindi con i nostri figli, così facendo daremo al nostro pianeta una generazione più consapevole.</i></p>
<p><i>Questo libro non è solo per coloro che stanno vivendo la paternità o stanno pianificando di farlo, è una lettura per chiunque abbia un impulso di conoscere e amare se stesso, oltre il razionale, senza restrizioni, e quindi accettare e amare l'altro allo stesso modo.""</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">Daniela Salas, mamma, traduttrice e cantante, Città del Messico.</p> <p><i>L'autore mette a nudo la sua anima al lettore come un modo per dimostrare che questo libro e i suoi principi sono nati da una profonda e lunga introspezione e autoindagine. Il libro non è un manuale su come fare i genitori, piuttosto, condivide principi e realizzazioni, da provare e testare, scoprendo le modifiche che uno ritenga opportune. Lui stesso ammette: ""Non sono nessuno, ma invece, un padre e forse un amico che si sente responsabile della condivisione di queste intuizioni."" In questo modo rinfrescante e poco ortodosso, l'autore ti accompagna in un viaggio per diventare un genitore migliore ... una proposta a cui nessun padre dovrebbe rinunciare”. </i></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">Gonzalo Briceno, padre, programmatore e trader, San Francisco, USA.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>""Non è facile parlare di sé stessi e Daniel ci introduce nel suo mondo, nel suo autentico cammino, con storie che non solo condividono l'unicità della sua vita, ma raggiungono la profondità dell'esperienza umana che la rende universale.  In Occidente, come uomini, ci è stato insegnato poco su come relazionarsi con gli altri e con noi stessi, (corpo, emozioni e pensieri) ed è a questo punto che Daniel, ci dà luce.  Attraverso il suo personale percorso ci introduce alla filosofia vedica dell'India, e costruisce un ponte con basi scientifiche (neuroscienze, biologia, psicologia) per non parlare solo di genitorialità, ma proporre anche semplici esercizi che ci invitano a contemplare i nostri conflitti e ad abbracciare le nostre storie.  Senza dubbio, una frase che mi rimane incisa di questo libro e che interpreta mio vissuto come padre è: ""...meglio avere un padre vero che un padre perfetto..."" e la consapevolezza del momento presente, senza inizio né fine.""</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: right;"">Jaime Zambrano, padre e psicologo, Santiago del Cile.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Ogni libro è un viaggio, e questo in particolare lo è. Da questa esperienza, la genitorialità, l'autore ci porta lungo un percorso vitale che è una scoperta, la rivelazione di un modo di essere. Il viaggio è sempre cambiamento, esperienza del nuovo, e questo libro è un invito a vivere la trasformazione e il risveglio della coscienza di ciascuno. Sottile e vero, onesto e commovente.</i></p>

</div></div>","La Storia
Ero uno studente di 26 anni, e la mia vita è cambiata nel momento in cui ho ricevuto la notizia che mio fratello si sarebbe unito ad un ordine di monaci sconosciuto, in un luogo sperduto nel Sud dell’India. All'improvviso si è innescato un processo senza precedenti con un turbinio di domande, che mi ha portato a riconoscere la presenza di una forma di sofferenza nascosta dentro di me: può sembrare un paradosso, ma è stata la cosa migliore che mi sia accaduta nella vita.
Spinto in una nuova dimensione di scoperta interiore, sono diventato un marinaio del dolore, l'architetto invisibile del mio pellegrinaggio da Santiago (Cile), a Los Angeles (CA), a Singapore, per finire a Valeggio sul Mincio (VR). Durante 14 anni ho viaggiato in India e in Messico, pieno di domande, cercando risposte. Ero ossessionato dal tema del Risveglio.
 
-------------
 

 
All'età di 38 anni la vita ha martellato piano piano nel mio cervello e inciso nel mio cuore, con la benedizione della paternità, le risposte che avevo cercato e parzialmente scoperto negli anni precedenti. Tutte quelle aspettative e quella ricerca senza fine sono svanite come foglie secche, spegnendo ogni domanda e conflitto interiore: ero in pace con me stesso... questa è la storia che racconta questo mio primo Libro: Il Viaggio di un Padre alla Scoperta Di Se Stesso.
Per “ascoltare e vedere” profondamente il bambino a cui ""dovremmo insegnare"", dobbiamo prima ascoltare e guardare noi stessi. A quel punto, loro, senza pretese, iniziano ad insegnarci e guidarci, aiutandoci a scoprire chi siamo veramente.
“Ti vedo figlio mio, perché prima ho guardato me stesso”...
-------------
 

 
La Visione  
Il mio sogno, per questo libro, è quello di aiutare tanti altri genitori come me a trovare quella verità interiore che consente di dissolvere la sofferenza personale, quel sottile conflitto interiore, che ci portiamo avanti come un fardello invisibile, di generazione in generazione, avvicinandoci, con delicatezza e umiltà, al modo di sperimentare del bambino. 
Il mondo ha bisogno di un cambiamento URGENTE e vedo questa emergenza sanitaria solo come un promemoria disperato della natura che ci chiede uno STOP. Fare una pausa e rallentare un attimo la nostra corsa sfrenata. 
Possiamo solo creare un mondo, allo stesso modo in cui ci relazioniamo con noi stessi. Quando il mondo crolla fuori, c’è un bambino che piange dentro.
 
-------------
 

 
Chi sono
Il mio nome è Daniel Bravo, sono un padre di 48 anni. Ho studiato Economia e sono nato a Santiago (Cile), attualmente vivo a Valeggio sul Mincio in provincia di Verona. Ho un figlio di 10 anni che mi ha ispirato e infuso il coraggio di scrivere questo libro. E’ un modo di onorarlo e ringraziarlo per tutto quello che ho imparato grazie a lui. 
Anche se da 10 anni lavoro come consulente nel campo dell’energia,  condividere le mie esperienze con “la Verità” come ricercatore spirituale e padre è la mia vocazione. 
 
-------------
 

Sul Libro
Il libro consta di 200 pagine circa e si sviluppa in 7 parti con circa 60 capitoli. In modo colloquiale, narra diversi momenti della mia vita, intrecciando episodi dell'infanzia, ai primi anni quando ho cominciato la mia ricerca interiore assiemi ai monaci a momenti della mia paternità, tessendo una storia che parla di risveglio della percezione, di come sanare le nostre ferite emotive, di genitorialità autentica e “dell’arte del disimparare"", come forze motrici dell'avventura della vita interiore di un padre.
Il libro ci mostra una mappa, con un percorso per genitori interessati all’Auto-consapevolezza.  È un invito a ridefinire il modo in cui ci poniamo di fronte alla Vita. Ma per farlo, dobbiamo riformulare il modo in cui vediamo noi stessi.  Quando ci immaginiamo come individui indipendenti, separati dal resto, il mondo sembra e si sente come una realtà separata, facendo così precipitare la nostra esistenza in una storia di desideri poco utili e paure infinite. Una tale esperienza influenza profondamente la nostra genitorialità e la risposta che otteniamo dalla vita attraverso i nostri figli.
 
Tempo e risorsa investiti
Finora ho investito 12 mesi di lavoro intenso, con oltre 800 ore di ricerca, scrittura, traduzione e implementazione del sito, blog, social media, piattaforma webinar, ecc. 
Ho investito anche circa 600 euro in costi vari di traduzione e hosting, e sono solo all’inizio. 
 
Come mi puoi aiutare e cosa ti offro a cambio
Per pubblicare questo libro in modo indipendente, ho individuato un obiettivo iniziale di 3.800 euro per la versione in italiano, per coprire i costi di stampa e marketing di circa 500 copie. Tuttavia, il mio obiettivo finale è raccoglierne 5.000 euro, per non essere troppo stretti con il budget. 
Questo importo mi consentirebbe di pubblicare come minimo 500 copie e di semplificare molti lavori di editing, formattazione, traduzione, stampa e marketing, realizzazione del sito, nonché di realizzare una versione per ebook, tutte cose che sto facendo da solo, contento, ma con un po’ di fatica. In dettaglio mi aiuterai a coprire i seguenti costi:

Revisione
Editing
Designs (copertina, sito, ecc)  
Layout dell'interno del libro (copia fisica e ebook)
Branding libro, sito e social media
Creazione di un paio di video promozionali
Piattaforme per i Podcast
Lancio e costi di marketing per 3/4 mesi
Stampa
Piattaforma Webinar
Software per il sito, funnel e social media 
Fee del 5% di questa piattaforma 

 
Tutto il denaro raccolto andrà alla produzione del libro, indipendentemente dal raggiungimento dell'obiettivo. Anche se il mio primo obiettivo non viene raggiunto, il mio impegno è di pubblicare almeno 100 libri, consegnandoli entro metà Ottobre 2020. 
Se supero il mio obiettivo finale di 5.000 euro, oltre a significare che siete tutti più fantastici di quanto mi aspettassi, intendo donare il 15% di quanto raccolto in eccesso al mio obiettivo iniziale, per aiutare a sostenere il lavoro di MayanFamilies.org, una non profit che implementa programmi di aiuto e sostegno alle comunità più povere nella regione del Lago Atitlan in Guatemala.

<p><strong>Situation Analysis SOSTAC Model (Small Business)</strong></p>
<p>The current small business climate in a word is <strong>stressed</strong>. COVID-19 has forced a change in the economic paradigm creating shifts in business openings and closures, constant ebbs, and flows of COVID-19 cases in the United States slowing the ability to buy and sell products and services. Small businesses are not only concerned but are financially stressed due to low to no sales. A market that has been severely impacted by COVID-19. <i>“More than half of all small business owners in the United States warn that the coronavirus crisis could make it tough to stay afloat, according to a new poll indicating that scores of small businesses are still grappling with lingering financial trouble amid an economic crisis that has already forced tens of thousands of firms to close” </i><strong>(Walsh, 2020)</strong>.  </p>
<p>The SBCCDM realizes that the dependency is on small businesses surviving and thriving in the short term to successfully sell its products and services. The short-term market condition directly impacts the medium and long-term market conditions. <i>“Using digital tools is no longer an admin task, it’s business-critical and has a direct impact on whether a business will survive”</i> <strong>(Xero, 2020)</strong>. With a digital perspective in mind, the SBCCDM B2B small business customer is identified by <strong>Who</strong> (existing small businesses pre-Covid 19), <strong>Why</strong> (fighting for a sustainable future), and <strong>How</strong> (using the SBCCDM digital tools and resources) and applying the digital online strategies to their <strong>business survival mix</strong>.</p>

<h3>The Impact: What You Should Know </h3>
<p><strong>Today</strong>, one of the biggest problems key business leaders face is ensuring their organizations are effective in their efforts to target the customer segments they have chosen to succeed.  With so many different marketing mixes and approaches, online marketing and promotion are crucial to your brand as a vital way to connect with potential customers using digital communication.  Building a solid customer relationship is key to increasing sales through digital marketing.  Your path to marketing success begins the moment you work with proven and competent marketing professionals who can provide the visibility needed to facilitate sales traction. </p>
<p><strong>Growing your customer base</strong> is key to achieving growth, revenue, and profitability goals.  Creating an appropriate framework to succeed in the digital marketplace requires goal setting, identifying applicable KPIs, using an effective funnel, and strategic planning.  At the Small Business Concierge, we understand the importance of value when it comes to choosing how to spend your marketing budget.  We get it.  Plus, we know that credibility and reputation are vital when choosing a business partner.</p>
<p><strong>The Seven Times Factor</strong> says as a universal rule, potential customers need to see an ad seven times or more before they buy.  In addition, research shows that, on average, you have to see an ad seven times before you even notice it.  So, digital advertising and promotion consistency are crucial to achieving the highest levels of success.  The biggest digital marketing mistake you can make is to <strong>market sporadically</strong>.  Regular and consistent marketing has an influence on how many and the duration of slow periods your business will experience.</p>
<p><strong>Your business success </strong>depends on the decisions you make or do not make.  Your decision to advertise in the Small Business Concierge Digital Catalog on a consistent basis will trigger the creation of monthly data points you can track to determine your increase in website visitors, page views, sessions, and rising sales.  The Small Business Concierge Magazine has grown steadily and improved its reach month by month to become a leading small business publishing solution. We are pairing the Small Business Concierge Digital Magazine with the Small Business Concierge Digital Catalog to double your marketing, advertising, and branding impact and efforts. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Raising capital online with Indiegogo reduces the biggest risks our organization can face.  Why?  Because using the right platform is important to ensure data security.  We, at the Small Business Concierge, take every precaution to identify and reduce risks both for our valued customers as well as ourselves.  Nothing could be more disastrous than having to face a data breach and violating privacy promises.  Thankfully, the Indiegogo platform solves our data privacy platform concerns.</p>
<p>Other concerns include the risk of not reaching the goal we established.  The ultimate goal of this campaign is contemplated in the light most favorable to a mutually beneficial win-win-win opportunity.  <strong>#1 Win.</strong>  Offer the highest quality marketing and advertising service possible at a reasonable price that will enable established small businesses the best chance to consistently market to gain visibility, credibility, and great value.  <strong>#2 Win.</strong> Meet an unmet market need by opening our doors to fill a niche.  Small businesses must do more with less.  Following a pandemic, businesses are vulnerable and must get the most value possible for their dollars.  At the SBC, we provide valuable branding, advertising, marketing, and promotion assistance to our clients. We keep them abreast of the latest information that gives their organizations the ability to leverage and exceed their growth goals.  <strong>#3 Win.</strong> To deliver the highest level of service the SBC needs to expand its team.  The money raised in this campaign is to fill critical roles that give this organization the best chance for long-term sustainable success. </p>

We need your business to stay in business!                                                                                                                                 


Here I am, the courageous and fierce leader fighting for small businesses to survive and thrive through this pandemic! I'm Margaret Jackson (MJ), I am the founder of the Small Business Concierge Communications & Digital Media (SBCCDM). I am also known as Bay Area/Silicon Valley's #1 Small Business Radio Personality on AM 1220 KDOW & iHeart Radio. We have watched small businesses suffer and lose hope for their business future because of COVID-19. We could not stand by and watch small businesses keep closing their doors.

So we did something about it. My team and I have designed contactless digital solutions to keep your products, services, videos, and more in front of your customers. We guide you on using our tools and help you develop your marketing, advertising, and branding intelligence to break through the barrier of the resistance of business growth in this pandemic.

The customers are out there, and you can reach them through our digital catalog advertising and magazine business solutions. We seek to support qualified-existing-small businesses in becoming the digital bridge to keeping you in front of your prospective customers worldwide.  What does that mean? It means you can reach customers locally, nationally, and internationally.   

                                                           
 
The Situation: What is your mass-media digital advertising Situation?
The Objective: What is your digital advertising Objective facing Covid-19 and the Delta Variant?
The Strategy: Do you have a mass-media digital advertising Strategy?
The Tactics: Are you interested in digital mass-media advertising Tactics?
The Actions: Are you willing to take Action on your mass-media digital advertising?

Situation Analysis SOSTAC Model (Small Business)
The current small business climate in a word is stressed. COVID-19 has forced a change in the economic paradigm creating shifts in business openings and closures, constant ebbs, and flows of COVID-19 cases in the United States slowing the ability to buy and sell products and services. Small businesses are not only concerned but are financially stressed due to low to no sales. A market that has been severely impacted by COVID-19. “More than half of all small business owners in the United States warn that the coronavirus crisis could make it tough to stay afloat, according to a new poll indicating that scores of small businesses are still grappling with lingering financial trouble amid an economic crisis that has already forced tens of thousands of firms to close” (Walsh, 2020).  
The SBCCDM realizes that the dependency is on small businesses surviving and thriving in the short term to successfully sell its products and services. The short-term market condition directly impacts the medium and long-term market conditions. “Using digital tools is no longer an admin task, it’s business-critical and has a direct impact on whether a business will survive” (Xero, 2020). With a digital perspective in mind, the SBCCDM B2B small business customer is identified by Who (existing small businesses pre-Covid 19), Why (fighting for a sustainable future), and How (using the SBCCDM digital tools and resources) and applying the digital online strategies to their business survival mix.

 
Situation Analysis SOSTAC Model (Intermediaries and Partnerships)
We have developed a mix of partnerships and intermediaries to increase routes to small businesses' survival. Although COVID-19 has impacted businesses globally, partnerships are more critical than ever before. A mix of partnerships can be key drivers to connect small businesses to corporations offering small business supportive products and services.
Our strategic partnerships are interested in engaging small businesses with special offers, discounts, and professional tips through the Advantage Membership Subscription.

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I‘ve been writing on and off for over twenty years. Last year, I published my first novel on <i>Amazon</i>, a Contemporary Romance entitled <i>Bound to the Baron</i>. It‘s the first in a series entitled <i>Royal Revels</i>. Unfortunately, with no budget for editors and advertising, the book had a very limited reach. However, the reviews from readers it did reach have been positive on <i>Amazon</i> and <i>Goodreads</i>. This year, I am taking my career to the next level. </p>
<p><br/>In January, I joined Romance Writers or America (RWA), and I have attended meetings at the Washington and Maryland chapters. I met some of the most supportive people, and I learned the importance of being in a community of other writers. Writing is solitary. It’s done alone, so writers don’t get to interact with people in their field on a daily basis. Organization meetings and conferences may be the only time we get to see each other in person. This year, RWA’s National Conference will be in New York City. It’s so close, yet so far. Attending this conference could be a game changer for my writing career. </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The chance to build a strong community with other writers and to meet with agents and editors makes this a must attend event for me. The education in the workshops offered alone would be worth the price of admission. However, there’s the price of admission. To attend this conference, I need to pay for the admission, the hotel stay in NYC, and incidentals which could be around $1500. I also need to pay for a professional edit of my manuscript, so I can submit it to any interested agents or editors in hopes of publications. Editing costs can run from $500-$1200, depending on the work that needs to be done to the manuscript. <strong>This campaign is to ask for your help to attend the conference and publish my second novel.</strong></p>
<p>I greatly appreciate any contribution you can make. The perks I'm rewarding as a thank you for your support include a digital copy of <i>Bound to the Baron</i> or pre-release copy of the second novel. For the high rollers who donate over $150, you get to see your name in print and for $200 your name will be given to one of the characters in the second novel. You'll also receive a signed copy of the second book before its release. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Anything above the expenses to attend RWA’s Conference will go to help fund the publication of my second novel. The second novel focuses on the relationship of two characters introduced in <i>Bound to the Baron</i>. I'm really excited about this story, and I believe in the emotional journey of these characters. This novel deals with topics not usually addressed in Romance novels including Depression and Anxiety, abuse, body image, and grief. Despite or because of that, it‘s a story about two people falling in love… and having some steamy times while doing it (no pun intended [okay, maybe it was intended]). </p>
<p>Since the <i>Baron </i>reviewers say they are eager to read the story of these two characters, I know there is already an audience interested in this second novel. Additional funding will help me publish the book this year and give it the chance it deserves.  </p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Short Summary:</h2>
<p>     This funding campaign is for the second of three books we are creating to preserve the hidden history of Coeburn, Virginia. This tiny corner of the Appalachian Mountains has in past times been a center of geological violence, a hunter's paradise, a farmer's haven, and a Wild-West boomtown. The sum of all the drama that has occurred in this tiny little spot on the globe is nearly unimaginable.</p>
<p>     Our first volume has already been written and delivered to our original IndieGoGo contributors, and the second volume is in the works. There were so many great stories we could not squeeze into the first book, that the second book is guaranteed to be an eye-opener.</p>
<p>     This campaign is designed to raise money to complete Volume 2 of a three volume work. Your support for this project will help us create a special set of local history books which can be enjoyed by you and younger generations to come. We really hope to see these books being read in local schools and libraries, and also become an important part of your home library. We are depending on you to help us make this happen!<br/> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">About The Authors:</h2>
<p>     Dee Ratliff Kenady grew up in the forests of the Cumberland Plateau, living the rare life of a free mountain child. As an adult she has worked hard to share her journey in print, publishing many poems, stories, and books that are well-rooted in her Appalachian life experiences. Dee's knowledge and insight about ""the old ways"" has been invaluable in framing this project in a meaningful context.</p>
<p>     Wade Kenady is originally from Caney Ridge, just inside Dickenson County. He began his education there in the two-room Rugby School, and later attended schools at Clintwood and Coeburn. As an amateur historian, he has studied local stories and Appalachian culture for more than a decade. Wade still has kinfolk in the Coeburn area, and considers it to be his hometown.<br/> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need:</h2>
<p>     To make this project work, we will need the support of the many others who also feel a special connection to Coeburn, Virginia. We not only need your financial support, but also your participation and encouragement.<br/><br/>     Plus, we will need your best gossip. So please tell anyone who will listen, ""Those people over there are up to something, and you need to see what it is!""<br/> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What You Get:</h2>
<p>     The minimum dollar goal for this campaign is $600. The funds raised will go toward research and travel expenses, publishing costs, shipping supplies, and postage to get your perks to you.<br/> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Book Design:</h2>
<p>     Instead of making one large, pricey hard-cover book of about 500 pages, we are spreading the same material out over three smaller, soft-cover volumes. That way each book will be more economical to produce, quicker to deliver, and more fulfilling to create. Plus, the fans of Coeburn, Virginia will have the option to support either one, two, or all three book projects.<br/><br/>     This particular funding campaign is ONLY for the second volume, but below are descriptions for all three.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Hidden Appalachia<br/>Coeburn, Virginia, Volume 1</h3>
<p>     This project was fully funded, and Volume 1 has already been published. Thank you so much for your support and encouragement! It was initially expected to take about six months to complete, but actually clocked in at nearly twelve. Some of the delays were due to the current COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected us all, but others were due to an insufficient knowledge of the devil who lives in the details of book publishing!<br/><br/>     There were the technical issues, such as: initially choosing a primary font which was hard to read, misunderstanding the cover art specifications, allowing insufficient time to receive book proofs, software quirks with an evil mind of their own, etc.<br/><br/>     There were also project management issues, such as: spreadsheet overload, typos in mailing lists, running out of shipping supplies, forgetting to always provide timely updates to contributors, etc.<br/><br/>     And personal quirks also came into play: excessive optimism about the production timeline, perfectionism causing endless revisions, trying to squeeze a 42"" waist into 36"" pants a.k.a. knowing which material must be cut but still not crying about it.<br/><br/>     But we have certainly learned from all our trials and errors with Volume 1, and the second book should go much smoother. At least now we have met some of the enemies and recognize them by their first names.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Hidden Appalachia<br/>Coeburn, Virginia, Volume 2</h3>
<p>     This funding campaign is for Volume 2, which is a continuation from the first book. This will have a similar design to Volume 1, being a 6"" x 9"" soft-cover of 128 pages, with about 15-20% of pages having images (i.e. photos, drawings, maps, etc.) and approximately 30,000 words. There will be self-contained articles of varying lengths, so you will not need to read it from cover-to-cover to enjoy it.<br/><br/>     We expect the second volume to take 6-9 months to deliver.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Hidden Appalachia<br/>Coeburn, Virginia, Volume 3</h3>
<p>     Volume 3 will be somewhat different than the first two. Though still a soft-cover 6"" x 9"", this book will be larger, with 200-500 pages, and a collection of biographical sketches, family stories, and photos of folks with connections to Coeburn communities. Unlike the first two, materials for this book will be provided by individuals and families who choose to participate. We will provide guidance for submitting the materials, editing of the photos and text for publication, and designing and assembling the book for the printer.<br/><br/>     There will be a separate funding campaign for the third volume.<br/> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Other Ways You Can Help:</h2>
<p>     People who can't contribute to the fundraiser can still help with this project:<br/><br/>     Please share this campaign on Facebook with your family members, friends, co-workers, and anyone else who might be interested in a book about Coeburn.

</h3>
<ul></ul> <p>Everyone knows a chasm exists between ethnic-minorities in America and conservative political causes/office holders/candidates/party(s). And everyone knows something must be done about it. The questions are how and who? Its going to take us black-Americans standing up in our own communities and saying, <br/><i>""It's time for some REAL change, y'all!!</i>""</p>
<p>That's exactly what we're doing. The Rocky Mountain Black Conservatives and American Conservatives of Color are a small but mighty group of men &amp; women who have what no one else in America has--a plan. An actual, written, executable <i>plan</i> for minority outreach. And it works. We are a group of America-loving patriots who are passionate about restoring our nation to its constitutional roots and educating our brothers &amp; sisters of color on the <i>truth</i> about conservative principles of governance. <br/></p> </div> <div> <h4>There's only <i>one</i> way to accomplish true, meaningful outreach.<br/>
</h4> <p>It cannot be done with slick television ads. Nor will attending conservatives-only meetings and choir preaching accomplish much. The only way to capture hearts &amp; minds is by getting out and burning some shoe leather! Our <i>5-Point Plan</i> for outreach focuses on building relationships first, asking for votes second. It cannot be done the other way around. We conservatives (of all colors) need to show up in minority neighborhoods on a consistent basis, build presence, awareness, face &amp; name recognition which then leads to developing respect and a rapport. There's no other way. It won't happen overnight, but with effort, persistence and funding - it will happen. We're living proof.<br/></p>
<p>We're building those relationships and a presence in the community by:<br/></p> <ul> <li>Having booths at &amp; participating in festivals and other cultural events put on by the local minority community such as MLK Day, Cinco de Mayo festivals, etc. <br/>
</li>
<li>Putting on our own events to which we invite members of the community to come, participate and be blessed -- we don't ask for votes, we don't argue about taxes or abortion or Obama anything else. Let's just get to know one another - there will be time for those discussions later. <br/>
</li>
<li>Conducting monthly on-the-ground events which local conservatives attend and may learn about our efforts, methods and techniques.</li>
<li>Traveling to other cities &amp; states and doing the same; we reach out to the local conservative community and invite them to attend our rallies, presentations or seminars where we then show them --give the actual tools-- for real, meaningful local outreach and inclusion. </li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h4>Why help fund us?</h4> <p>This organization &amp; movement is 100% grassroots. We get no funding from the Republican (or any other) party, we have no billionaires in the back room writing checks. As minorities ourselves, we're able to go places and say things to audiences that many are not able to. We've been doing that very thing for four years - burning our own gas, running up our own credit cards and believing God will make a way.  Our reach, effectiveness and notoriety have grown substantially. Along with them so have expenses. We need help. <br/></p>
<p>Our founder (Derrick Wilburn) is fond of saying, ""There are those who are called to go and those who are called to send those who are called to go."" If you've often wondered, ""What can I do to help reach blacks and combat the 'conservatives rae racists' narrative?"", supporting this group may be your answer to that question.<br/></p>
<h4>Can this really be done?<br/>
</h4>
<p>Yes. Black &amp; Hispanic neighborhoods across the country have been failed by 50 years of liberal representation and more &amp; more are awakening to this fact. But. Just because there's low-hanging fruit doesn't mean it will put itself into the harvest baskets. Someone has to go into the communities and do the work. <br/></p>
<p>One street, one neighborhood, one community, one city at a time. Its the only way. Your contributions help pay the expenses associated with all of the above activities; booths at street fairs &amp; festivals cost money. Events require a hall or room to be rented. In 2014 we put on our ""<b><i>TRUTH TRANSCENDS COLOR</i></b>"" events in Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Oklahoma, Wisconsin &amp; Washington D.C.  In 2015 we'd like to double or triple the number of states we travel to and spread our <i>5-Point Plan For Ethnic-Minority Outreach</i>. Traveling to other states and training like-minded conservatives requires airfare, lodging, and other expenses. We just can't do it ourselves.<br/></p>
<h4>Why it matters.</h4>
</div><div> <p>The demographic makeup of America is changing. Our nation is turning brown. Fast. If the demographic makeup of the conservative side of the political isle does not begin changing along with it, our future could be in very serious peril.

<br/><br/>The goal of this book “A Little Boy Named Collin Bean” is to promote friendship and cooperation among our children. This book gives a modern touch in using magic and wishes as instrumental in realizing one’s potential strengths and weaknesses to fly over the hills, into the mountains, through the woods, and down the ocean side to realize one’s dream. And yet Collin Bean, the main character stays in touch with reality when he realizes that it’s time to go home.

<br/><br/>This book is inspired by my grandson Collin James (we call him Collin Bean) who was born prematurely and was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was young. However, he grew up to be a smart, brave, and friendly 5-year old. Currently, he is using a wheel chair for his mobility. I would like to share this inspiration with children around the world and allow them to explore the warmth of making friends and the spirit of cooperation while having fun.
<br/><br/>This book tells about how a little boy’s desire to make friends and help others led to his exciting adventures. Collin Bean is helped by a goblin named Prixstar who makes little boys’ dreams come true. Collin Bean and Prixstar flew over the hills, into the mountains, through the woods, and down the ocean side to meet new friends named Ryleegator, Clairebear, Lylabear, Quinniebee, Ardie Rabbit, Pregolama, Jetrogoat, Hansy Tortoise, and Master Ant. All the friends got busy and inspired to build their dream castle that they can call their home. However, a strong storm ruined their dream castle. Despite the unexpected disaster and problem, Collin Bean and his friends continued to flourish their friendship with love and care.

<br/><br/>Your contributions to this project will cover production costs, marketing costs, and packaging the special rewards.

If we are lucky to raise additional funds, they will be used to produce additional titles in the series. <br/><br/>I would like to thank the project’s future backers in advance.

<br/><br/>Please help us spread the word and make some noise about this campaign. I am very passionate about this project and I hope you will too. My team and I appreciate your support and generosity. This 30-page hardcover book is recommended for children 3-years old and above. It has colorful illustrations to maintain the child’s interest.

Please make this project happen.</div>","A Little Boy Named Collin Bean
The goal of this book “A Little Boy Named Collin Bean” is to promote friendship and cooperation among our children. This book gives a modern touch in using magic and wishes as instrumental in realizing one’s potential strengths and weaknesses to fly over the hills, into the mountains, through the woods, and down the ocean side to realize one’s dream. And yet Collin Bean, the main character stays in touch with reality when he realizes that it’s time to go home.

This book is inspired by my grandson Collin James (we call him Collin Bean) who was born prematurely and was diagnosed with cerebral palsy when he was young. However, he grew up to be a smart, brave, and friendly 5-year old. Currently, he is using a wheel chair for his mobility. I would like to share this inspiration with children around the world and allow them to explore the warmth of making friends and the spirit of cooperation while having fun.
This book tells about how a little boy’s desire to make friends and help others led to his exciting adventures. Collin Bean is helped by a goblin named Prixstar who makes little boys’ dreams come true. Collin Bean and Prixstar flew over the hills, into the mountains, through the woods, and down the ocean side to meet new friends named Ryleegator, Clairebear, Lylabear, Quinniebee, Ardie Rabbit, Pregolama, Jetrogoat, Hansy Tortoise, and Master Ant. All the friends got busy and inspired to build their dream castle that they can call their home. However, a strong storm ruined their dream castle. Despite the unexpected disaster and problem, Collin Bean and his friends continued to flourish their friendship with love and care. Their friendship stood this test of time and they were able to build a stronger castle made of stones, rocks, wood, and sand. Love and care became the foundation of this friendship that they carry with them in their travel to far away places. Collin Bean and his friends experienced enriching journeys. This book talks about the joys of making friends and the reality of facing problems such as the storm in developing a stronger position in the community.
Innocence is a gift that we’d like to share with our children while learning is a process that we’d like to take a major role in their lives. I hope that this book can serve our children in more ways than one with significant impact in the development of their character. Everyone needs help and extending one’s self even at a tender age can enhance the very core of friendship and care in every child’s heart.

<h3>The Second Issue</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>Table Talk: Issue II, set to release this coming February, is centered on the idea of dyno:
 a movement in rock climbing where the climber must let go of 
everything, leaping through mid-air in order to surpass an otherwise 
insurmountable obstacle. </b>This decision to surrender stability and risk 
everything for one’s goal is not restricted to rock climbing. From 
fishermen who venture into dangerous waters for the big catch, to poets 
who abandon the rules of convention and risk their reputations to create
 new styles of writing, this moment of dyno is a new lens for understanding perseverance, innovation, and creativity.</p>

The biggest leap and challenge comes now, where we need to raise the support to actually bring the second issue into the world.

Une fièvre peut tuer, une grippe peut tuer, un rhume peut tuer, une cataracte peut tuer.Le système hospitalier est faible voir inexistant et lorsqu'un proche est malade, on prie juste le ciel pour ne pas avoir à pleurer sa dépouille.J'ai prié et espéré que cela n'arrive pas à l'un des miens mais le 15 Février 2015, j'ai dû affronter une dure réalité.Si je m'adresse à vous aujourd'hui sur ce site, c'est parce que je sais qu'il existe encore des hommes, des femmes à l’instar de cette jeune demoiselle qui m'a trouvée en larmes et qui m'a offert un mouchoir pour sécher mes pleures.En vérité, cette jeune fille m'a offert bien plus qu'un mouchoir, elle m'a offert son aide, à sa façon, et ce simple geste vécu sur le moment, est bien plus beau que tout l'or du monde.Je sais qu'il existe encore des personnes comme elle, avec beaucoup d'humanité, qui ne supportent pas que les autres souffrent et c'est pour cela que je fais appel à vous.Certaines personnes ne prendront pas la peine de lire ce message pourtant j'aimerais vraiment qu'il touche les cœurs et que mon projet aboutisse pour renforcer le système éducatif et hospitalier en RCA et plus particulièrement à Berbérati, ma commune de naissance.Je veux que les enfants puissent y aller à l'école dans de bonnes conditions et goûter aux joies simples de la vie comme le goûtent les enfants en Europe.L'idée serait d'apporter des fonds pour renforcer les dispositifs éducatifs et médicaux des établissements de Berbérati. Si l'on peut initier le projet dans d'autres villes alentours ça sera parfait.

re-reading parts of it the other day I came across a passage in which Marine Science PhD Isabel Craine (a fictional character, of course) is fretting-- obsessing-- over her failure to make any dent in stopping the destructive momentum of our culture, despite frequent media appearances and even testimony before the U.S. Senate regarding pollution, climate change and the dangers of myriad techno-industrial activities' impacts upon the oceans.  One of her worried thoughts is that the oceans as a whole may be dying...  Re-reading that passage, I found myself doubting my own words and research.  Is it credible that a renowned expert marine scientist would actually have reason to be concerned about widespread, possibly rapid extinction within the vast, diverse oceans?<br/><br/>Unfortunately,<br/><br/>Yes:<br/><br/>(Headline):<br/>""The Oceans are Dying: Oxygen is Depleting, Acidity Rising at Fastest Rate in 300,000,000 Years"" (yes-- that's 300 MILLION years-- the article is linked at the bottom of this page)<br/><br/>In the face of such overwhelming, large-scale problems, it is easy for any individual to feel it is not possible to address this burgeoning crisis-- but it is not an advisable strategy to ignore this sort of current event in favor of measuring Kardashian's parts or Brady's inflation.<br/><br/>My young son Leo, like many his age, LOVES ocean creatures and dinosaurs.  He has many toy versions of these that he plays with near-constantly (he fills containers with water throughout the house for his whales, sharks, crabs and friends to live and play in:), he pores through books and seeks-out media (nature programs/ DVDs, educational programs, cartoons) which feature these...  Planet Earth, Dinosaur Train, Octonauts, others with which fellow-parents of young children will likely be familiar...  It saddens me to think that, depending on how rapidly this extinction progresses, many of his favorite ocean creatures may be in the same category as the dinosaurs in his lifetime.<br/><br/>But for what little it may actually accomplish, I engaged in a labor of love in writing World of Wounds, continuing in my efforts now to promote it, representing a heartfelt effort on my part to contribute what I believe to be an important part of what must happen for our culture, its priorities and worldview to shift sufficiently to begin a necessary healing, even a whisper of decreasing our culture's relentlessly-increasing destructive emissions and behaviors (behaviors such as, to name just one, clear-cutting the Amazon basin and all of the planet's other tropical rainforests, which are currently approaching a point of no return in which they, ""our planet's lungs"" (i.e. oxygen-source), may irreversibly (in our species' lifetime) revert away from being a forest at all).<br/><br/>We need new stories.  We need to shift our way of seeing the world, our way of treating it, our way of relating to it, what we now think is ""normal"" in life.<br/><br/>I'm not suggesting that I am ""enlightened""-enough to write ""The Book"" which serves as ""The Solution"" and causes ""The Transformation"" which would be necessary for survival instead of where our culture is now rapidly-headlong taking itself.  I wish I could accomplish this, but I don't give myself that credit-- and I certainly admit that I do not consistently, sufficiently walk my own talk regarding every detail of that which I critique.  I grew up in this culture, and share in its propensities, appetites and weaknesses (and contribute with my lifestyle, habits and perceived needs to its too-destructive ""strengths"").<br/><br/>World of Wounds was not written to be a self-righteous screed, but a story, which points in a direction, a direction which I myself have been very far from perfect in always moving...  This is one of the reasons that addiction plays a conspicuous role in the unfolding and overall/ underlying themes of the novel.  We have appetites, we have comforts and habits which will not dissolve overnight even IF we want them to...  I am working as hard as I can on that IF part, attempting to contribute  a good, appealing story-- five interwoven stories in World of Wounds-- in which readers can see and embrace how appealing, fulfilling and-- well, even exciting in its way-- participating actively, individually and within communities can be in the effort to achieve a Full, Necessary Transformation in an entirely new direction.<br/><br/>Really, it is a new kind of frontier, of pioneering; it is a literal New World which we must create, together, to survive and for other life-forms which will otherwise certainly perish to survive...  Maybe, possibly even once again thrive.  Possibly.  <br/><br/>Now, we live alienated and fill the void with ""busy""-ness and techno-utopian fantasy, Apple-sponsored, Disney-magic-midwifed Bread and Circuses galore.<br/><br/>Part of what World of Wounds represents, attempts, is an invitation to the new, true, necessary Adventure of creating The More Beautiful World Our Hearts Know is Possible (credit to one of my great current mentor/ peers, Charles Eisenstein, for that great phrase).<br/><br/>I know many have long-ago written-off this sort of topic as Negative, as Doomsaying, as a bunch of whining and bluster about overwhelming problems without a solution.<br/><br/>I offer a more positive spin , which I have attempted to embody in my novel World of Wounds:<br/><br/>We Are the Problem as it currently stands, BUT We in our lives and Communities are The Only Possible SOLUTION as well-- and it is a Great Adventure for us to embrace this opportunity, this responsibility, to Live Into the new world-- to Make that new world Possible.<br/><br/><a href=""http://m.dailykos.com/story/2013/10/04/1243700/-The-Oceans-are-Dying-Oxygen-is-Depleting-Acidity-Rising-at-Fastest-Rate-in-300-000-000-Years"" rel=""noopener

As children read this story, it is my hope that they will realize that every characteristic, interest, or skill was given to them purposefully and help them build their self-esteem. 



How Will the Money will be Used 
The funds raised will be used to market and produce ""The Birthday Story"" in addition to funding the beginning stages of ""The Birthday Story"" party stickers. Here is the budget in detail below. 
Paperback and Ebook production- $500
Marketing Items-$900
Retainer for Public Relations-$2800
Party Stickers-$800
 As a thank you for your help, I have created some great perks in return.  Those of you who choose the perks that come with merchandise, will be the lucky ones to have these items first!

<b></b><p>This storytelling card game is a way to help inspire creativity by using a child's imagination. Many children get writer's block. They spend half of their time just trying to figure out what to write about. I am one of those children. I thought, wouldn't it be easier to have a picture to prompt an idea? And with that, this storytelling game was born. With wonderfully illustrated pictures children will become inspired to create fun and imaginative stories to write about or verbally tell. This is a card game and can be taken anywhere. Children can use it for their story writing or as a fun game to play with family and friends. This game is engaging. Want to get a group of people to suddenly bond and laugh together? Play the game and instantly fun ensues.</p>
<p>Game Info:</p>
<p> There are 54 cards in a pack with instructions on other uses of the game, including writing prompts. I am also creating a deluxe pack that will contain 100+ cards and a special gift. The single card pack will cost around $10-$15 when produced. The Deluxe pack will between $30-$40. Our goal is to get the price as low as possible for our customers. We are working to put it on Amazon. For right now it will be sold on our website at <a href=""http://www.reneeahand.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.reneeahand.com</a> </p>

She wishes to support her son's endeavors so is offering her books, radio show, and authors visits as perks. Her son will be traveling with her on author visits and will be demonstrating the game to children around the country. The Adventures of Joe-Joe Nut and Biscuit Bill Adventure Series are mystery books that are science based. Teachers in school districts or homeschools will be able to use these books as a cross curriculum for students in 2nd to 5th grades. They fill a niche.

</div></div>","What is this about?Gabriel's Story
This storytelling card game is a way to help inspire creativity by using a child's imagination. Many children get writer's block. They spend half of their time just trying to figure out what to write about. I am one of those children. I thought, wouldn't it be easier to have a picture to prompt an idea? And with that, this storytelling game was born. With wonderfully illustrated pictures children will become inspired to create fun and imaginative stories to write about or verbally tell. This is a card game and can be taken anywhere. Children can use it for their story writing or as a fun game to play with family and friends. This game is engaging. Want to get a group of people to suddenly bond and laugh together? Play the game and instantly fun ensues.
Game Info:
 There are 54 cards in a pack with instructions on other uses of the game, including writing prompts. I am also creating a deluxe pack that will contain 100+ cards and a special gift. The single card pack will cost around $10-$15 when produced. The Deluxe pack will between $30-$40. Our goal is to get the price as low as possible for our customers. We are working to put it on Amazon. For right now it will be sold on our website at www.reneeahand.com 




The Book Perks
Helping with the perks is Gabriel's mother, Award-Winning Author Renee Hand. She wishes to support her son's endeavors so is offering her books, radio show, and authors visits as perks. Her son will be traveling with her on author visits and will be demonstrating the game to children around the country. The Adventures of Joe-Joe Nut and Biscuit Bill Adventure Series are mystery books that are science based. Teachers in school districts or homeschools will be able to use these books as a cross curriculum for students in 2nd to 5th grades. They fill a niche. They are mysteries that cover topics such as animal tracks, rocks and minerals, and weathering, erosion, and art. The newest book will incorporate Greek Mythology. This is what the books are about:
Book 1 is The Great Pie Catastrophe

In this story each page is surrounded by animal tracks that pertain to each suspect, and at the end of the story there are animal facts and questions pages. It is the case of the missing pie.
Book 2 is Mineral Mischief



In this story each suspect collects a specific rock and mineral. For example: Liam the Llama collects igneous rock like gabbro and diorite, but there is one rock in his collection that has a very unique property. He shares that with you as do they all about their collections.
Book 3 is The Secret of the Missing Arch

In this mystery Joe-Joe Nut and Biscuit Bill get with local famous artists of Acorn Valley to create one of a kind paintings about the weather. They are apart of a fundraiser to raise money for animals who have lost their homes because of the weather. Flooding, drought, what have you. At the auction readers will learn 2 things. One, is what inspired the artists to paint such amazing paintings. Two, meteorologist  Rainstar will explain the science behind the phenomenon. Readers will learn some great information all while solving a mystery. Book 4 is The Parade of Heroes
Greek History abounds in this 4th adventure in the Joe-Joe Nut and Biscuit Bill award-winning mystery series. Joe-Joe and Biscuit are visiting Acorn Valley's Greek Festival when mysterious things begin happening. Greek hero balloons for the parade are stolen, as are other Greek related items throughout the town.

This book will satisfy the standards schools are requiring for Greek Mythology. Great to use in the classroom. This is a fun way to cover this field. Here is what some people have said about this series so far.
Hand's first entry in the series, The Great Pie Catastrophe, won Creative Child Magazine's Seal of Excellence Award, along with her second entry Mineral Mischief, which won a  Creative Child Magazine's Preferred Choice Award. With so much to recommend this entry is rich in presentation. A glossary of weather terminology, artist bios and activities for kids are included.

<div>I am Diego Polanco from Guatemala City. I´ve seen that unfortunately more than 11 companies close each day! One of the main reasons is because they cannot compete with larger companies. Why is that? Guatemala City is a very competitive market and if a company does not have the tools and the money to do publicity, they cannot adquire new customers, simple.

<div>So what I am going to do is to give them a tool that has proved to be very effective, to make publicity and give them the chance to create a new customer base, to comunicate every action they do and be competitive.This is a very cheap tool because companies only get charge for every coupon sold, so it means that if they don´t sell a single coupon through the platform, they are not going to be charged. </div>

If I make it, YOU are going to be saving a lot of companies. Which means less unemployment, less migration.   What we need and what you get
I need to start this $3,000. In a country where the avarage salary per year is $3,200, that´s a lot so I really need your help.

Our question of interest is how to <u>facilitate the communication of special moments between Croats and Chinese without language being a barrier.</u> <strong>Interesting fact</strong> – although 60% of Croats speak English, only 1% of Chinese can understand and read it, so you can put that trick right back up your sleeve. Our logical solution is to teach a Chinese Croatian, or a Croat Chinese.</p><p>You may think to yourself “<i>Why should I bother with learning?

Naše pitanje od interesa je kako omogućiti komunikaciju posebnih trenutaka između Hrvata i Kineza, a da jezik ne bude barijera. Zanimljiva činjenica – iako 60 % Hrvata zna engleski jezik, samo 1 % Kineza ga razumije i zna pričati, tako da tog asa spremite nazad u rukav. Naše logično rješenje je naučiti Kineza hrvatski jezik ili Hrvata kineski jezik.Možda ćete si sada pomisliti „Zašto da se mučim i učim? Kineski jezik je pretežak!“, ali prije toga par činjenica. Jedan Kinez po putovanju prosječno potroši oko 750 eura. Hrvatsku je do 20. listopada 2017. godine posjetilo više od 143 tisuće kineskih turista, koji su ostvarili 213,3 tisuće noćenja, što je 57 % dolazaka i 49 % noćenja više nego prošle godine.  Znači, svake godine sve više kineskih turista posjećuje Hrvatsku i želi ostvariti komunikaciju s domaćinom. Ka - ching :)A što ako vam kažemo da se ne morate mučiti s učenjem kineskog jezika kako biste komunicirali s Kinezima. Da! Postoji brzo, jednostavno i lagano rješenje. Suvremeni priručnik hrvatsko- kineskog jezika gdje ćete pronaći:
Hrvatsko- kineski pojmovnik pomoću kojeg Hrvat može fonetski izgovoriti kinesku riječ ili čitav pojam
Kinesko-hrvatski pojmovnik obogaćen kaligrafskim pismom (ukoliko imate čudan kineski naglasak, ovaj dio priručnika će  pomoći)
Ilustracije s detaljnim opisom položaja jezika i usta prilikom izgovora pojedinog kineskog znaka ili pojma
Uobičajene fraze i riječi koje se upotrebljavaju u svakodnevnoj komunikaciji
Kako možete biti dio naše kampanje?Knjiga je napisana, ali kako bi ugledala svjetlo dana predstoji nam još puno posla. Autorica priručnika Marija Opačak, marljivo je radila proteklih mjeseci na pripremanju sadržaja te razgovarala s brojnim akterima koji bi mogli pomoći u izdavanju knjige. Sada slijedi lektura i korektura hrvatskog i kineskog teksta, dizajn i ilustracije, tisak, distribucija... a tu nastupaš TI, dragi čitatelju! Što više sredstava uspijemo prikupiti, to će knjiga biti kvalitetnija i ljepša. Tvrdi uvez, besprijekorne ilustracije, tisak na recikliranom papiru - samo su neki od detalja na koje ti možeš utjecati. Knjigu planiramo završiti i objaviti do lipnja 2018. godine.Čitav projekt ovisi o prikupljenim sredstvima, a svoj doprinos možeš dati na vrlo jednostavan način. Kao znak zahvalnosti, pripremili smo ti različite nagrade koje se nalaze s desne strane pored ovog teksta. Pronađi nešto što te zanima te sa samo par klikova, uz sigurnu transakciju putem kreditne/debitne kartice, budi dio kampanje.Ako želiš kombinirati neke nagrade koje nisu ponuđene, pošalji nam poruku pa ćemo se dogovoriti.Kako još možeš pomoći?Nadamo se da ćeš prepoznati vrijednost ove inicijative i pomoći nam da uspješno dođemo do cilja. Ako nisi u mogućnosti financijski podržati izdavanje knjige - nema problema, razumijemo te! Postoji čitav niz drugih načina kako nam možeš pomoći!Za početak, podijeli informaciju o ovoj kampanji i planiranom terminu objave knjige među svojim prijateljima, članovima obitelji, susjedima, kolegama, suradnicima, tetama u knjižnici ili bilo kim tko bi imao koristi od našeg priručnika.Hvala•Thanks•谢谢！ [EN] - English versionThe Chinese are the no.1 word travellers and their main motivation for visiting a country is to explore cultural sights and natural phenomena. Our question of interest is how to facilitate the communication of special moments between Croats and Chinese without language being a barrier. Interesting fact – although 60% of Croats speak English, only 1% of Chinese can understand and read it, so you can put that trick right back up your sleeve. Our logical solution is to teach a Chinese Croatian, or a Croat Chinese.You may think to yourself “Why should I bother with learning? Chinese is too difficult!”, but before you do, here are a few facts. One Chinese spends about 750 Euro per trip. By 20 October 2017, more than 143 thousand Chinese tourists visited Croatia, and they made 213.3 thousand overnight stays, which is 57% visits and 49% overnight stays more than last year. So, each year more and more Chinese tourists visit Croatia and want to establish communication with the host.Ka - ching :)What if we tell you that you don’t have to go through the trouble of learning Chinese to communicate with the Chinese? Yes! There is a fast, simple and easy solution. A contemporary Chinese-Croatian manual where you will find:
Croatian-Chinese glossary which the Croatian can use to phonetically pronounce a Chinese word or the whole phrase
Chinese-Croatian glossary enriched with calligraphic script (if you have a weird Chinese accent, this part of the manual will be helpful)
Illustrations with a detailed description of the tongue and mouth positions for pronouncing a specific Chinese symbol or term
Common phrases and words used in everyday communication
How can you be a part of my campaign? The book is written, but there is still a lot of work to do for it to see the light of day. The author of this manual, Marija Opačak, has been working diligently over the past months to prepare the content and talking to a number of stakeholders who could help in publishing the book. Now the Croatian and Chinese texts need to be proofed and corrected, the design and illustrations need to be made, it needs to be printed and distributed… this is where YOU come in, dear reader! The more funds we raise, the better and more beautiful the book will be. Hard cover, impeccable illustrations, printing on recycled paper – these are just some of the details you can have a say in. We plan to complete and publish the book by June 2018.The entire project depends on the funds collected, and you can contribute in a very simple way. As a sign of gratitude, we have prepared various perks on the right side next to this text. Find something you find interesting and with just a few clicks, with a secure credit/debit card transaction, become part of the campaign.  If you would like to combine some perks which are not offered here, send us a message and we can arrange it. How else can you help?We hope you will recognize the value of this initiative and help us reach our goal successfully. If you are not able to financially support the publishing of this book – no problem, we understand!

<p>In meditation I was told by my angel
guides, “We want you to share stories of heartache, pain, hope and personal
transformation. Your story is to be about how everyday women have faced
challenges, maybe even hitting rock bottom emotionally and financially, and
what has created the shift within them from despair and desperation to hope and
courage."" <br/></p><p><br/></p><p><i>“Embraced by the Divine – The Emerging Woman’s Gateway to Power, Passion and Purpose is filled with empowering stories of strength and courage that will inspire you to trust that there’s always hope, even in the most difficult times. This book will guide you in living your greatest life.”</i><br/><b>~ Marci Shimoff #1 NY Times Bestselling Author</b></p><p><b></b><br/></p>
<p>I wrote my own chapter in <i>Embraced
by the Divine</i> about the multiple levels of Fear I had to move through
progressively – each one increasingly outside of my comfort zone – in
order to think bigger and to take my healing and teaching work onto the world
stage. So many times my Faith and Trust were tested to the limit as I was
called to surrender the self-doubt and limiting beliefs about not being good
enough.  In the process I truly felt myself embraced by the Divine.</p>
<p>My journey through layers of deeper
fear still continues as the Divine invites me to continue stepping up, more
fully in my power, so I can make a bigger difference in the world than I had
ever dreamed possible. My intention is to inspire you to do the same. <i>Embraced by the Divine</i> gives
you the practical tools, techniques and processes allow you to live your life passionately on purpose.</p>
<p>Each chapter is a deeply personal,
raw and vulnerable account of one or more crisis periods in each woman’s life,
her <i>Dark Night of the Soul</i>. The authors show how in partnership with the Divine they
found that deep inner courage and strength to not only break through to a
higher level and to grow as a person, but also to follow their dreams and achieve
success, often phenomenally. <br/></p><p><i><br/></i></p><p><i>This co-creation is also a testament to the power of women heralding in the new paradigm of the feminine way of working in collaboration, co-operation and love.</i><br/></p>
<p><br/></p><p>Now I am inviting all heart-centered
people, such as you, to help Angel Wings Publishers and me publish <i>Embraced
by the Divine – The Emerging Woman’s Gateway to Power, Passion and Purpose. </i>Our
goal is to make this book available for purchase around the world so its powerful messages of love, inspiration, courage and hope can be accessible to women everywhere. <br/></p><p>Please join me and the book collaborators with your pledge today. We

Embraced by the Divine – The
Emerging Woman’s Gateway to Power, Passion and Purpose shows us that no matter what challenges, misfortunes or
trauma life throws at us, there is always the chance to turn it around, to grow
from the experience and to triumph against all odds. I have created this
crowdfunding campaign as another way to demonstrate that we can overcome just about anything
with the feminine way of cooperation, support and power. Receive a FREE CHAPTER from the book to enjoy now when you contribute $20 or more, as well as lots of other great Perks!
Perhaps you did not realize that getting a book out there these days is not like it used to be … these days the promotion comes down to the authors. Authors don’t usually make a lot of money out of publishing a book and this one is truly a labor of love. We believe so strongly in the messages of this book that we want it to get out to as many people as possible. And with your funding and support we can do that. We’ve always felt this is a co-creation and an example of the new way forward and we’d love you to be a part of this journey with us.Each co-author in this book was selected based on divine guidance. None of them were asked to pay a fee up front to be involved.Join me today to move
mountains and bridge continents to make this vision a reality! (You can get the full breakdown of how the funds will be used further down the page.)
Hi, I’m Michelle Mayur, the
compiling author of this exceptional anthology BY women FOR women. Embraced

from some of the most light-filled soul sisters,
In meditation I was told by my angel
guides, “We want you to share stories of heartache, pain, hope and personal
transformation. Your story is to be about how everyday women have faced
challenges, maybe even hitting rock bottom emotionally and financially, and
what has created the shift within them from despair and desperation to hope and
courage."" “Embraced by the Divine – The Emerging Woman’s Gateway to Power, Passion and Purpose is filled with empowering stories of strength and courage that will inspire you to trust that there’s always hope, even in the most difficult times.

<br/><b><h3>MEET THE AUTHOR:</h3></b><p>  am 26, I have a degree in English literature and I haven't written a book before. I am just like you, I do not consider myself special or different since all can achieve spiritual communication as the book perfectly describes. I was not born with the clairaudient ability, but I achieved it through meditation. One day while in meditation I requested to connect with my divinity and the voice that came soon after came clearly through my own inner hearing ""We are here connecting with you now. Do not be afraid, all is well"". Soon after I crafted the ability by connecting the same way with the angels, spirit guides and ascended masters. The high frequency,  happy emotion and unconditional love they pass on makes me not doubt their good energies and intentions. I know what you are thinking and I always ask to be protected before any connection with the spirit realm. Fortunately, I only have experiences with pure and loving spirits and I assure you this book is the outcome of such connections. This book now is part of my life purpose and I know I am destined to help many by bringing it to the world. When the angels asked me to write it I had no doubt that it would be the right thing. Now few months later I am so proud  of it and eager for all of you to read it. I Believe in this book because it provides genuine truth on how the world is, how it was created and everyday exercises and techniques to make our life better and manifest our desires. This book overwhelms with positive energy. I find myself reading it over and over to get good energy and higher connection. What I really want is to fulfill my life's purpose and help as many people as possible. This is only the beginning and I am sure more ways will follow.</p>

 My name is Poppy and I am the author of ""Spiritual Awakening"". I take direct narration from the angels through mental hearing (clairaudience). They guided me here now; they guided you here as well. Contribute to bring change to the world, share this campaign to assist the angels with their work of helping us all rise.

for help. We listened, we respond."" - -The

enlightenment. The angels' words are loving, soothing and inspirational,
resembling their nature. This book fills the reader with high energy,

we are and what is our life's purpose, it explains the science behind
the law of attraction and offers insightful
explanations to magical exercises and rituals towards
the expansion of self.  THIS IS NOT A RELIGIOUS BOOK; IT IS SPIRITUAL.
In a few words, it is a guide from beyond
towards bliss and completion of being. You can boldly describe it as

<p>Amanda Hamilton (front row, second from left) set out
originally to create a magazine full of prose, poetry, essays, and artwork that
were both excellent in craft and fun to read.</p>
<p>In less than two years,
that idea has blossomed into something incredible. The response to Blue Monday
Review’s vision -- as well as its admiration for our inspiration, Kurt Vonnegut
-- was immediate. Submissions poured into our email account and soon,
a dedicated group of volunteers joined the BMR bandwagon to help. </p>

<p>As we grow, so does our vision. The next big goal on our horizon is to become a non-profit

for literature to create programs for KC schools, and the community at large, to encourage
writing and reading in all stages of life. </p>

It comprises three parts:Part 1:  Awards won by Anthony Marr as an activist - in animal rights, animal welfare, wildlife preservation and environmentalism.Part 2:  Accolades won by Anthony Marr as a scientist and a philosopher - for his new science-based philosophical system [The Omnsicentific Cosmology] and his book [OMNI-SCIENCE and the Human Destiny] - his first book of five.Part 3:  Readers' comments on the first 6 chapters (among 50) of [BEAUTIFUL LIFE].
PART 1 (of 3) - Awards in Activism
Anthony Marr is winner of the prestigious Henry Spira Grassroots 
Activist Award at the 2010 Animal Rights National Conference in 
Washington DC, for his ""outstanding contribution to animal liberation"".

Not coincidentally, he was also honored with the BEST ALL-AROUND ACTIVIST AWARD by Negotiation Is Over in the same year, with the following accolade:  
""Whether protecting tiger reserves in India, risking his life in 
undercover investigations of the illegal trade in endangered species 
parts; challenging any and all forms of hunting; hosting a radio show; 
writing visionary books on science, philosophy, and cosmology; embarking

each covering 30-40 US states  in 4-7 months,
or mobilizing scientific research to awaken the complacent to the 
imminent dangers of irreversible ecological crisis, Anthony Marr is 
raising awareness, effectively campaigning, and blazing new trails. In 
1999, he founded Heal Our Planet Earth (HOPE), and in 2003, he launched the Global 
Anti-Hunting Coalition.


""For anyone skeptical of what one person can do alone or 
in strategic alliance with others, or what can be accomplished without

PART 2 (of 3) - Accolades for OMNI-SCIENCE
In 1977, during a solo camping trip in Africa, Anthony Marr conceived

Samuel O Lee:  Very
 interesting... the free history lesson!  I've

evolution of China, so this was an informative, albeit brief, 
introduction to this fascinating subject. 
Andie VanderHoek:  You are a brilliant man... fascinating read...

Nakia Anderson:  Anthony,
 your mother was a beautiful woman and I am very glad that she was able 
to survive such horror!  I'm sure she would be proud of the wonderful 
man you have become. Your writings are a very important and well done 
part of educating others about history and honoring the victims.  And 
thank you for sharing part of your life, your  writings and insight with us...Gay Maveety:  Holy smokes! What a story!
Karen V. Stefanini:  Thank you for sharing this heart wrenching yet inspiring story of your heritage and beautiful mother.
Janet Zimmermann Snyder:  I too often think how cruel men are. I love stories where they are 
heros. As the woman was. Your mother must have been the most beautiful 
woman in the village. It's wonderful she escaped and met
 your father. You and your family's story should be a movie. I'm hooked!
Becky Combe Daigle:  Your
 mother was a very beautiful woman and I know how highly you speak of 
her. I thank God she was able to escape. I can't imagine what she went 
through. 
Brie Inglesby:  Riveting!
Chandrika Gadiewasam:  Oh my goodness. I am speechless!
Melissa Maura:  I
 am filled with emotion and amazement. Nothing surprises me when it 
comes to the horrors of mankind, but this particular time and space in 
history I knew nothing about. Thank you for your reflections and insight
 and tribute to your mother. It is magnificently
 written and I am deeply appreciative of your sharing it. I shall read 
it over and over. Hugs, love and respect... By the way, your Mum was a 
classic beauty.

your mother for being strong, escaping & moving on and very thankful
 that soldier assisted.  Continue to share her story  & that of 
others.

Ian Ionian:  Very compelling.  Glad that you walk among us and a happy mothers day to your beautiful strong proud mother.... awe inspiring and informative!  Your vivid memory astounds and is very... awesome!!
Jessica Rath:  I had never heard about the Comfort Women. Thank you for sharing
 the story of your mother; what a legacy you have. No wonder you spend 
your life defending innocent creatures.
Gracie Wagg:  You are such a credit to humanity Anthony Marr. May the long time sun shine upon you, all love surround you, and the pure light within you, guide your way on.
Patty Beecham:  ... a wonderfully told story...
Anne Orman:  That
 is an amazing account of your family Anthony.My own mother had her own 
house in London bombed around her when she was 12 years old and was left
 with only what she was wearing,covered in coal dust because they had 
hidden in the cupboard under the stairs.I
 resented this story as I was growing up because my mother told every 
friend I ever brought home but it is only now that I am nearly 50 years 
old that I understand how terribly frightening it would have been for 
her.
Rajee Seetharam:  ... a beautiful story... straight from the heart and so has a lot of soul...
Joanne Sallows:  ... such an amazing piece of writing...
Karin Saks:  Am thoroughly enjoying your writing.
Nakia Anderson:  Beautifully written Anthony! You are a gifted writer.  Thank you for sharing it. I would like to read your entire book.

 an amazing journey of 7 decades beautifully written.  May your life be 
blessed and filled with so much love today and always.
Felicity Jackson:  Superb piece of writing. I loved Tan Twan 
Eng's books, The Gift of Rain and The Garden of Evening Mists, both set 
(through flashbacks) in this era, so really appreciate the chance to 
read this!
Valerie Warburton:  Even with my ADHD I did not want to stop reading this story,..
Paris Harvey:  Delighted to read the story about the man.

</div> <p></p><p><b>MY STORY</b></p><p>With a strong desire to make a positive contribution
to the world the idea of the “Fairy bun” emerged. Being a seamstress for over
10 years enabled me to create the “Fairy bun” business. I am a passionate spirit with a burning desire for everyone to be a part of my dream and believe that miracles really can come true. I am a New York-er with the a big apple dream!  Running this campaign is a wonderful opportunity for my company to thrive and grow.
Although a novice to the small business community I created and started “Fairy
buns” to make a statement to people everywhere that dreams are possible. I also
created Fairy Buns because I want people worldwide to look and feel good about
themselves. Fairy buns enables people to feel confident and bold!</p><p><b>THE FAIRY BUN MISSION:</b> The mission
of my company is to make people feel good about the way they look. Looking good
makes you feel good! I also aspire to please my customers with an individual
one-of-a-kind product that is unique and trendy. The “Fairy Bun” is a way to
reach many different walks of life and merge them all with the perfect fashion
hair accessory. </p>
<p><b> BUSINESS CHALLENGES:</b>  The
biggest business challenge that I face today would have to be the delay of
necessary adequate financial backing needed to produce products and market my
company. With the right amount of finances and supplies to produce more
products and further style creations of the “Fairy Bun”, I can be 100% ready and
able to service my supporting customers. It can be a hindrance when you don’t
have enough finances to meet the supply and demand of your customers. Having
sufficient financial backing will allow me to service many individuals.  I would love to be able to offer the “Fairy
Bun” to everyone all over the globe. Marketing and public relations are of the
utmost importance to any business. With the right marketing and public
relations I know that people everywhere will love my product. </p><p><b>THE FUTURE OF THE FAIRY BUNS: </b>Although my
company has attracted a devoted fan base, it is not where I aspire it to be. In
the next 2-5 years I would love to take advantage of the fact that the hair
accessories market is financially thriving tremendously. With the youth all
over the world seeking out the latest trends and accessories I envision my
unique and first of its kind hair accessory “Fairy Buns” as a household name
not just nationwide but worldwide within the next few years or so. Hair buns
right now are a huge fashion must for kids, girls and women. Hair accessories
are products that are always needed no matter what era arises. Fashion will
always be around and I hope my “Fairy Buns” will be as well.</p>
<p><b>WHAT WILL BE DONE: </b>A
business is created and started from a mere thought but without the substantial
finances and marketing it can seem impossible to succeed. With the Indiegogo campaign, businesses like mine are given the chance to rise and
become more than what they presently are. Gaining the $10,000 needed to finance supplies will enrich my company and allow me to achieve the financial backing
that I aspire to obtain. Having adequate finances allows me to produce more of
my product at a faster rate and it will also enable me to develop a long
lasting relationship with the Fairy Bun contributors. If funded every contributor will be proud to
say they contributed something great to help the Fairy Bun company gain notice
of people all around the world. Being a small business owner can often times
feel challenging without the right marketing tools necessary to help the growth
of the business. What gaining exposure and support from contributors will do is allow me
to enhance and strengthen my companies’ vision and values all the while
publicly advancing the “Fairy Bun” business. </p><br/></div>","Fairy Buns

<h3><i>United Methodist Clergy &amp; Churches Stand for Love</i></h3> <ul> <li>Clergy have been officiating same gender weddings for years in our California-Pacific annual conference.  We will continue to do so because we understand the heart of God as infinitely wide, and <b>the rite of marriage to be open to all people</b>.</li> <li>However, many people only see and know the media headlines of UMC clergy trials, defrockings and the denunciation(s) of the LGBTQ community by the United Methodist Church.  #stoptheharm</li>
<li>
<i><b>We need to change the headlines and lift our open and inclusive voice of love for all -- boldly, strongly and pervasively.  We need to #stoptheharm and stand up publicly for LOVE in God's church.</b></i><br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul> <li>We are raising <b>$4500</b> to purchase eye-catching, well-designed printed advertisements in major and regional publications throughout the reaches of our California-Pacific Conference.  We are working directly with Reconciling Ministries Network to design and place the ads.</li>
<li>These ads will do two things -- 1) list the names of UMC clergy in our conference that officiate same gender weddings and the churches who will host them; and 2) serve as an invitation to our upcoming October 10 ""Come for Love ... Stay for Art"" Renewal of Vows Ceremony for the LGBTQ community (in the sanctuary of Pasadena First United Methodist Church).  For more information about that special day, visit:  <a href=""http://calpacloveforall.eventbrite.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://calpacloveforall.eventbrite.com</a>
</li> <li>We are seeking to purchase full page ads in the <i>LA Weekly</i>, <i>OC Weekly</i>, <i>Advocate</i> and <i>New Times</i>; and ...</li> <li>Smaller but equally impactful ads in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, the <i>Honolulu Star Advertiser</i>, and the <i>San Diego Tribune.</i>
</li>
<li>San Luis Obispo United Methodist Church (SLOUMC) will act as the financial agent for the event and all funds collected will be handled by SLOUMC. </li>
</ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <ul> <li>Printed advertising is costly -- wow, is it ever!  We do have a large goal, but it is a realistic goal to get these ads to press. </li>
<li>Progressive, non-incendiary news doesn't grab headlines. </li>
<li>Both of these challenges have silenced our voice in the past, but no longer ... because we believe Jesus' message of love is mightier than any rhetoric or religious law.  In fact, we not only believe it -- we KNOW it.  Help us step up to this challenge and let our voice be heard.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <ul> <li>Please <b>share</b> this campaign!  </li>

United Methodist Clergy & Churches Stand for Love  Clergy have been officiating same gender weddings for years in our California-Pacific annual conference.  We will continue to do so because we understand the heart of God as infinitely wide, and the rite of marriage to be open to all people. However, many people only see and know the media headlines of UMC clergy trials, defrockings and the denunciation(s) of the LGBTQ community by the United Methodist Church.  #stoptheharm

We need to change the headlines and lift our open and inclusive voice of love for all -- boldly, strongly and pervasively.  We need to #stoptheharm and stand up publicly for LOVE in God's church.
    What We Need & What You Get  We are raising $4500 to purchase eye-catching, well-designed printed advertisements in major and regional publications throughout the reaches of our California-Pacific Conference.  We are working directly with Reconciling Ministries Network to design and place the ads.
These ads will do two things -- 1) list the names of UMC clergy in our conference that officiate same gender weddings and the churches who will host them; and 2) serve as an invitation to our upcoming October 10 ""Come for Love ... Stay for Art"" Renewal of Vows Ceremony for the LGBTQ community (in the sanctuary of Pasadena First United Methodist Church).  For more information about that special day, visit:  http://calpacloveforall.eventbrite.com
 We are seeking to purchase full page ads in the LA Weekly, OC Weekly, Advocate and New Times; and ... Smaller but equally impactful ads in the Los Angeles Times, the Honolulu Star Advertiser, and the San Diego Tribune.

San Luis Obispo United Methodist Church (SLOUMC) will act as the financial agent for the event and all funds collected will be handled by SLOUMC. 

  Risks & Challenges  Printed advertising is costly -- wow, is it ever!  We do have a large goal, but it is a realistic goal to get these ads to press. 
Progressive, non-incendiary news doesn't grab headlines. 
Both of these challenges have silenced our voice in the past, but no longer ... because we believe Jesus' message of love is mightier than any rhetoric or religious law.  In fact, we not only believe it -- we KNOW it.  Help us step up to this challenge and let our voice be heard.    Other Ways You Can Help  Please share this campaign!  
Help plan the Oct. 10 ""Come for Love ... Stay for Art"" Renewal of Vows gathering.  Visit:  http://calpacloveforall.eventbrite.com  to learn how.
Attend the  Oct. 10 ""Come for Love ... Stay for Art"" Renewal of Vows gathering. Every single donation, every single share of this campaign helps us change the message from one of hate and exile to one of love and inclusion.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Delany is one of the most brilliant, stimulating, and uncompromising writers on the contemporary American literary scene. His exuberantly innovative work, which encompasses novels, short stories, criticism, memoir, and graphic novels, has won him the admiration of legions of readers. Some are drawn to his science fiction, some to his work focusing on issues of sexuality and race, some to his literary criticism, and many to the whole vast tapestry of his work. For this work Delany has garnered awards from all over the literary map, including four Nebula Awards and two Hugo Awards, a Lambda Literary Award, the Bill Whitehead Memorial Award for a Lifetime Contribution to Lesbian and Gay Literature, and inclusion in the prestigious Norton Anthology of African American Literature. </p><p>Currently I am compiling, transcribing, editing, and annotating Delany’s personal journals. The journals are being published by Wesleyan University Press in what is projected to be a series of at least six volumes, with each volume covering roughly one decade’s worth of material. The first volume, <i>In Search of Silence</i>, has recently been released to very positive reviews (see below). It covers the period from Delany’s teenage years in the late 1950s to the end of the 1960s, during which time Delany established himself as a major figure in what came to be called New Wave science fiction. The second volume, <i>Autumnal City</i>, will present Delany’s journals from the 1970s, during which time he wrote the bulk of what many consider the pivotal work of his career, <i>Dhalgren</i> (1975), as well as <i>Trouble on Triton</i> (1976), the first volume of the Nevèrÿon tetralogy (<i>Tales of Nevèrÿon</i> [1979]), and many works of criticism.</p><p>The goal of this campaign is to raise $30,000 to support the remaining year's worth of work needed to complete the second volume. This funding will cover three areas: expenses associated with the project (travel to the archives, travel to interview subjects, office expenses, and so on), expenses associated with this campaign (fees and percentages, cost and shipping of rewards, and so on), and personal expenses. Funds raised in this campaign will not support Wesleyan University Press, but rather will go directly to me, in support of my scholarly labor. In academic publishing, an author's income comes not from book advances or sales, but rather from a university paycheck – or, if the author is an independent scholar (as I am), from some other source. For this project, <i>you</i> will be that source.</p><h3>Why You Should Sponsor This Project</h3><p>The first reason you should sponsor this project is that it will make thousands of pages of heretofore unpublished writing by Delany available to the public. This writing will be of great interest to Delany’s readers in particular, to readers concerned with innovative writing that treats issues of race, sexuality, and social marginality, and to all those interested in reading a record of the personal experiences of an astonishingly lucid and incisive American writer and thinker as he traverses the second half of the 20th century and beyond. By supporting this project you will directly help get Delany’s personal journals out into the world.</p><p>The second reason you should support this project is that it's on track. One year ago, I ran the first crowdfunding campaign for this volume and received generous support -- though only enough to cover the first year's worth of what is a two-year project. Today, work on the volume has progressed to exactly where I predicted it would be at this point in time. This makes me confident that, barring unforeseeable delays, the project will remain on schedule. In other words, donating to this project requires no special leap of faith on your part: if you fund it, it will get done.</p><p>The third reason you should sponsor this project is that since its recent publication, the first volume in the series, <i>In Search of Silence</i>, has received very positive reviews. Below are links to two of them; do check them out, as they give a vivid sense of the many riches offered by the volume (and, by implication, the volumes to come):</p><p><a href=""https://newrepublic.com/article/142767/samuel-r-delanys-life-contradictions"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://newrepublic.com/article/142767/samuel-r-delanys-life-contradictions</a></p><p><a href=""https://www.barnesandnoble.com/review/genre-life-frank-robinson-samuel-delany"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.barnesandnoble.com/review/genre-lif...</a></p><p>Here I must highlight a statement from the review by Paul Di Filippo above: ""Much of the book’s success has to be credited to the masterful work by editor Kenneth R. James."" Reviews like this, in short, should give you confidence that you are supporting a high-quality project.</p><p>Fourth and finally, my ability to devote full-time work to the volume will actually enhance its quality, and in a specific way. While completing the first volume, I had Samuel Delany himself on hand to answer my countless questions on matters not covered by his own autobiographical work or other secondary sources. This enriched the volume greatly, and needless to say, I want to preserve this working relationship for future volumes. But – to be blunt – Delany is not getting any younger.  Producing volumes quickly will help ensure Delany’s continued participation. Thus, by supporting full-time work on the second volume, you will help improve it – and, with luck, improve the quality of volumes to come.</p><h3>Perks</h3><p>To add to the interest and fun of the campaign, I have included several rewards for different levels of donation. These rewards may be waived should the donor wish the bulk of his or her donation to go straight to the project.</p><p>Donors at the first level (“Singer,” from $10 to $59) and all higher levels will receive updates on the project.</p><p>Donors at the second level (“Scorpion,” from $60 to $99), in addition to receiving updates on the project, will also receive what is, in my opinion, the most purely fun reward of the lot: a Samuel Delany t-shirt. The photographer Becket Logan has given me permission to use his striking photo portrait of Delany as the basis for the shirt’s graphic. I've received very positive feedback for this perk; donors to the first campaign who received t-shirts have really enjoyed them. (Note: if I receive 500 Scorpion-level donations for the current campaign, the goal of the campaign will be reached. I suspect there are 500 Delany readers out there willing to donate $60 to this project. Perhaps you are one of them.)</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501602346/ojomwlful8lcafjg0kks.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Donors at the third level (“Liberator,” $100 and above) will receive the rewards for the previous two levels – and, in addition, a hardcover copy of either Volume 1 (<i>In Search of Silence</i>) or Volume 2 (<i>Autumnal City</i>). Also, donors at this level will be listed, if they so desire, on a special Acknowledgments page in <i>Autumnal City</i>. Check out the cover of <i>In Search of Silence</i> below; as you can see, it's a handsome volume:<br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501601871/se84nu6mdy6ie1dd0cr2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Donors at the fourth level (“Sygn,” $200 and above) will receive hardcover copies of both <i>In Search of Silence</i> and <i>Autumnal City</i>, the t-shirt, and the listing on the Acknowledgments page of <i>Autumnal City</i>.</p><p>Donors at the fifth level (“Golden,” $500 and above) will receive, in addition to the t-shirt and Acknowledgments listing, a copy of <i>In Search of Silence</i> signed by Delany himself.</p><p>(Note: if donations exceed the campaign goal of $30,000, then the extra funds will go directly toward work on the third volume. If the goal is reached before the campaign ends, those who make a “Liberator”-level donation after this point will have their name listed in the third volume rather than the second.)</p><h3>Final Thoughts</h3><p>Here are some more endorsements for the first volume, <i>In Search of Silence</i>:</p><p>“Mesmerizing . . . a true portrait of an artist as a young Black man . . . already visible in these pages are the wit, sensitivity, penetration, playfulness and the incandescent intelligence that will characterize Delany and his extraordinary work.” —Junot Díaz, author of <i>The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao</i></p><p>“This is a tremendously significant and vital addition to the oeuvre of Samuel Delany; it clarifies questions not only of the writer’s process, but also his development—to see, in his juvenilia, traces that take full form in his novels—is literally breathtaking.” —Matthew Cheney, author of <i>Blood: Stories</i></p><p>""The first hardcover volume of Samuel Delany's journals, out now from Wesleyan University Press (covering the 1950s and 1960s) is both magisterial and inspirational -- and boy, do we need the inspiration now.

<h3>Why am I asking you to donate? Good question!</h3>
<p>I am reaching out for your support in publishing the book ""Rory's Rainbow"". This is a children's story that I have written and am in the final stages of illustrating that deals with the topics of identity exploration, gender creativity, and acceptance.</p>
<p>The story is about a toy dinosaur named Rory. Rory lives in a toy store. Tulso's Toy Store. On the third shelf up in the section filled with what the owner calls 'toys for boys' to be exact. Rory is a lot like the other toy dinosaurs, except for in all the ways that they aren't. Follow Rory on their journey as they discover their true self, make supportive friends, and even meet an ally along the way that changes everything in Tulso's Toy Store.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get...</h3>
<p>I am choosing to self-publish this book because self-publishing gives more opportunity to represent your work yourself, and if need be - advocate. As the parent of a gender creative child, a member of the LGBT community I feel strongly about the topic of this story, and would like to be front &amp; center to support it every step of the way. Unfortunately, publishing and exposure costs money. </p>
<ul>
<li>I have decided on a Toronto based publishing company. The quote I have received based on my estimated number of pages and preferred format is in the $2,800 range. The funds raised above that amount will be used for packaging, shipping &amp; promotional materials such as representational packages for book stores, postcards, banners, posters, and strategically placed ads, and to help cover the costs of securing booths for book signings at local events.</li>
<li>As lovely as it would be to have people just hand over money, let's face it - the world doesn't work like that. So in exchange for your support I am offering several support levels each with different perks. Some of these perks include: Special edition postcards featuring illustrations from the story, your very own signed copy of Rory's Rainbow, your name listed on the 'Special Acknowledgements' page in the book, and an original signed watercolour illustration from the story! You also have the option of helping to get this story out in the community by choosing to have a book donated to a local little free library!</li>

Children struggling with their identity can face lifelong problems with their self worth and self image.

These events have already happened and will happen again in a near future, when automated systems will replace human operators and unmanned planes will fill the skies. Tom Dieusaert wrote a book about this phenomenon.   </p><p><strong>Who is Tom?</strong></p><p>He is a Belgian prize-winning journalist and author who has written books in Dutch, Spanish and English, the last one being ""The Beetle Diaries"". He is an environmental activist and has a sceptic stance about our consumer society and that's maybe why he likes to live on the edge of modern society, in the Tigre delta of Argentina.  </p><p><strong>Writing a book is a journey</strong></p><p>Due to a strange twist of fate, he got interested in the subject of plane crashes and the involvement of computers in those accidents. Tom actually didn't know anything about aviation, or even how planes got off the ground, before he started this research. He set out on an investigative journey through different countries like Brazil and France where he interviewed many specialists and read dozens of reports, articles and documents.</p><p><strong>Man versus machine</strong></p><p>The reader of ""Computer Crashes” will be amazed how much of a daily commercial flight is controlled by automated systems, computers that can breakdown, as they tend to do in our every day life. However the idea of the aviation industry is to introduce unmanned planes in the very near future. Is that safe?</p><p><strong>The campaign</strong></p><p>This Indiegogo campaign is primarily focused on launching the book in the mainstream media to reach a maximum readership. Crowdfunding not only collects the necessary funds to lay-out, to print it and to distribute the book, but also to run a press campaign and get reviews.</p><p><strong>Print copies and e-books as perks</strong></p><p>The great thing about this crowdfunding project, is that while you are helping to make it happen, you are already promoting the book. By supporting the project, you are assuring yourself of a print copy or e-book and you will get to read it before the general public does and hopefully recommend it. We strongly believe in word of mouth, still the most powerful marketing tool, even better than the social media. Reading a book is more effective than just ""liking"" it. </p><p><strong>The Content</strong></p><p>And this folks, is the best part of ""Computer Crashes"".

No, not at all. These events have already happened and will happen again in a near future, when automated systems will replace human operators and unmanned planes will fill the skies. Tom Dieusaert wrote a book about this phenomenon.   Who is Tom?He is a Belgian prize-winning journalist and author who has written books in Dutch, Spanish and English, the last one being ""The Beetle Diaries"". He is an environmental activist and has a sceptic stance about our consumer society and that's maybe why he likes to live on the edge of modern society, in the Tigre delta of Argentina.  Writing a book is a journeyDue to a strange twist of fate, he got interested in the subject of plane crashes and the involvement of computers in those accidents. Tom actually didn't know anything about aviation, or even how planes got off the ground, before he started this research. He set out on an investigative journey through different countries like Brazil and France where he interviewed many specialists and read dozens of reports, articles and documents.Man versus machineThe reader of ""Computer Crashes” will be amazed how much of a daily commercial flight is controlled by automated systems, computers that can breakdown, as they tend to do in our every day life. However the idea of the aviation industry is to introduce unmanned planes in the very near future. Is that safe?The campaignThis Indiegogo campaign is primarily focused on launching the book in the mainstream media to reach a maximum readership. Crowdfunding not only collects the necessary funds to lay-out, to print it and to distribute the book, but also to run a press campaign and get reviews.Print copies and e-books as perksThe great thing about this crowdfunding project, is that while you are helping to make it happen, you are already promoting the book. By supporting the project, you are assuring yourself of a print copy or e-book and you will get to read it before the general public does and hopefully recommend it. We strongly believe in word of mouth, still the most powerful marketing tool, even better than the social media. Reading a book is more effective than just ""liking"" it. The ContentAnd this folks, is the best part of ""Computer Crashes"". It is not only a very  timely subject, it is above all a compelling read, which puts you in the situation of a pilot or a passenger.

<h3><strong>Give Young People a Voice</strong></h3>
<p>The children's book world has been talking about diversity and inclusion for years, and although more recently there's been some positive concrete action, in many ways we're still going round in circles about the causes, the problems and the challenges. Inclusive Minds is a not-for-profit collective and we want to see real change.</p>
<p>But who is going to make that change happen? </p>
<h3><strong>YOU!</strong></h3>
<p>You can make a real difference. By supporting the Inclusive Minds crowdfunding campaign, <strong><u>you</u></strong> can help ensure that children’s books include a diverse range of characters who are truly authentic. </p>
<h3><strong>The Plan</strong></h3>
<p>Our plan to support real change involves children and young people – the people who know most about what they want to see represented in books and how.  </p>
<p>Where real inclusion in books is concerned, thorough research is vital. With your support, we will develop an extensive network of ambassadors for inclusion; young people with real experience of marginalization who can share their unique expertise (covering all facets of diversity) with the book world. </p>
<p>Authors, illustrators and publishers will be able to contact Inclusive Minds with questions, manuscripts or ideas that they wish to discuss with relevant young people. We will share the opportunity with our network and make connections*. Ambassadors may also be available to speak at events and in response to news stories.</p>
<p>As well as helping to dramatically improve authenticity and relevance, this groundbreaking project will give marginalised young people themselves a real voice in changing the face of children's books.</p>
<p>* For child protection, under 18s will be contacted via a parent or carer</p>
<h3><strong>The Added Bonus</strong></h3>
<p>As well as giving these young people a real voice, involvement in the network will provide insight into and experience of the writing and publishing industry, hopefully making them feel it is a place where they can belong, and in which they can play a valuable part. This in turn should help to diversify the children’s book industry of the future.</p>
<p>The benefits to the young people on the ambassador scheme are many and varied, as well as being valuable work experience that may lead to references and further work experience. We’ll encourage those using the network to give back to ambassadors. Some of the benefits they might receive are detailed on our website.</p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>£4,000 will fund Inclusive Minds to grow the pilot project by recruiting young people (up to the age of 30) with an extremely diverse range of experience and backgrounds and cover the administration and promotion of the network for two years. The funding will enable the basic network service to be free of charge, but should relationships develop or lead to more official consultation or sensitivity reading, the network user and ambassador would be expected to introduce and agree fees.</p>
<p>Contributors can choose from a menu of exciting perks, including a mention on our <a href=""http://www.inclusiveminds.com/wall-of-thanks.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">wall of thanks</a>, thank you messages from ambassadors, authors and illustrators, signed books, and inclusive book artwork and prints.</p>
<p>Backers can also take pride in the fact that they are helping to create a unique resource that will change the face of children’s books.</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>We know from experience that authentic representation has a huge impact on children who have experienced marginalisation and who may be seeing themselves in a book for the first time. It's also vital for ALL children to see a diverse range of characters in books.</p>
<p>A successful pilot has proven the value of such a resource:</p>
<p>Author Robin Stevens contacted us last year as she was planning to include a British Hindu character in a forthcoming book. Although she had already done plenty of research, she wanted to consult people from a British Hindu background to ensure authenticity. We found several willing candidates in our pilot team of ambassadors – young British Hindus with very real and very relevant experience.</p>
<p>The result was a fully rounded character in Robin’s book, and a hugely valuable experience for several young people.  Robin tells us:</p>
<p><i>'It's important to research every aspect of your book, but sometimes research is no substitute for experience. I am so grateful to Inclusive Minds for putting me in touch with young readers from a British Hindu background, who helped me ensure that the portrayal of my detective George was not only accurate, but rang true.’</i></p>

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Greetings ladies. Greetings gentlemen. Greetings quadrupeds and cherubs. Welcome to my life.</p>
<p>My name is James Lawson Moore, but you will soon know me as the Wannabe Artist. I am a writer, having just finished my studies in English and literature at my local college. I've been writing for most of my life, but now that I'm nearing 30 in a couple of years I figured it was time to take the next step.</p>
<p>Which brings me to what I've done here. My first serious attempt at creating a publishable book-length manuscript is practically finished. <i>The Journal of a Wannabe Artist</i>, a collection of poems and prose poems, contains some of my most personal writing, and I think it's quite good. I have it edited and formatted, and I even have a cover done up. All that remains is to raise some funds so that I can print up copies and begin that next step in writing, from completing a book to publishing it. </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>I'm hoping to raise $1000 with this campaign. With the funds, I intend to copyright the book and print copies for sale at book conventions, indie bookshops, libraries, etc. I would also like to have some money left over to go towards a small online promotional campaign for my Facebook writing page as well as for myself as a writer. </p>
<p>The main perk you will be able to get is a copy of the book itself. But that's not all. I also have copies of previous books I have privately published, books of which there is only a limited supply. Those who choose one of the higher-tier incentives will receive items such as the bound galleys or a copy of the first draft, both of which contain earlier versions of the poems.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>I am really excited about this book, and I think you will come to love it as much as I have. This book (which is the first in an intended series of books) contains some of what I believe to be the rawest and most real of confessional poetry, along with rather sobering stories in verse form. I believe that this book is a real gem, and I would be estatic to have it out into the world.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>There is no real risk those of you who give to the campaign. I am offering incentives such as books and so forth, and I will be sending them your way. </p>
<p>The main challenge is raising the capital to bring this book to press and let it out into the world. With the funds you give I will be able to do that.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Greetings ladies. Greetings gentlemen. Greetings quadrupeds and cherubs. Welcome to my life.
My name is James Lawson Moore, but you will soon know me as the Wannabe Artist. I am a writer, having just finished my studies in English and literature at my local college. I've been writing for most of my life, but now that I'm nearing 30 in a couple of years I figured it was time to take the next step.
Which brings me to what I've done here. My first serious attempt at creating a publishable book-length manuscript is practically finished. The Journal of a Wannabe Artist, a collection of poems and prose poems, contains some of my most personal writing, and I think it's quite good. I have it edited and formatted, and I even have a cover done up. All that remains is to raise some funds so that I can print up copies and begin that next step in writing, from completing a book to publishing it. 
What We Need & What You Get
I'm hoping to raise $1000 with this campaign. With the funds, I intend to copyright the book and print copies for sale at book conventions, indie bookshops, libraries, etc. I would also like to have some money left over to go towards a small online promotional campaign for my Facebook writing page as well as for myself as a writer. 
The main perk you will be able to get is a copy of the book itself. But that's not all. I also have copies of previous books I have privately published, books of which there is only a limited supply. Those who choose one of the higher-tier incentives will receive items such as the bound galleys or a copy of the first draft, both of which contain earlier versions of the poems.
The Impact
I am really excited about this book, and I think you will come to love it as much as I have. This book (which is the first in an intended series of books) contains some of what I believe to be the rawest and most real of confessional poetry, along with rather sobering stories in verse form. I believe that this book is a real gem, and I would be estatic to have it out into the world.
Risks & Challenges
There is no real risk those of you who give to the campaign. I am offering incentives such as books and so forth, and I will be sending them your way. 
The main challenge is raising the capital to bring this book to press and let it out into the world. With the funds you give I will be able to do that.
Other Ways You Can Help
As a struggling writer and 20-something, I know full well that money can be tight. If you are unable to give (which I fully understand, so no harm or foul), another way you can help is to share this campaign on your Facebook or twitter. Anything to get the word out would be much appreciated.
And that's all there is to it. Again, thank you so much for taking the time to help me out.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I never expected an encounter with a homeless man to move me like Myron, aka ""Glennie Strucks"".  I work at a radio station in downtown Chicago.  I walk to work.  It's kind of a mindless walk to be honest.  But the last few months, I decided to engage the homeless more and try to get an understanding of who they are, what they love, and how they feel.  Myron was one of those people.  I asked him, ""What do you want people to know about you?""  Without blinking an eye he said, ""I'm a hell of a writer"". </p>
<p>Turns out, Myron writes every day.  He has multiple journals with his desires, musings, and experiences poured into each page.  In reading them, the best way to describe them would be homeless ""psalms"".  His writings echo the pain, the longing, despair, anger, and reality of living on the street.  Despite experiencing homelessness, Myron identifies as a writer. </p>
<p>He is the reason I'm posting this campaign.  Myron is smart, charismatic, likable, and has so much potential!  He has what it takes to be a writer and motivational speaker, helping others better understand those experiencing homelessness and in so doing, lifting others off the street as well.  Your support for this project will change Myron's life.</p>
<p>I am asking for $4,000 for this campaign.  The funds will allow Myron's book to be printed.  The remaining funds will be used solely for finding Myron a safe place to live.  </p>
<p>When I first mentioned the idea of this project, Myron's eyes lit up.  Just the thought of knowing that his words could be in a physical book blew him away.  I think he felt validated in a way (as well he should!)  I know of no other book written by a homeless man.  If you contribute to this campaign, you'll be a part of the success story that IS Myron's.  </p>
<p>The content of his book is complete.  I have started working with Adam, another Chicagoan who knows Myron and is passionate about addressing the issue of homelessness, to help get the book edited, designed, and published.  Adam will also be creating a website (pro bono) to advertise Myron’s book and speaking engagements after the campaign is over, so your contribution now will have an impact that outlasts just this campaign.  We have already inputted Myron’s handwritten journals into a computer file and had them edited. We have identified a promising book publisher and are in process of having the book cover designed. I see no major challenges to this project, and if we run into any unforeseen issues, I’m not worried because Myron’s cause is worth it.  </p>
</div><div><p>Even if you're unable to support this campaign financially, you can still help Myron by getting the word out through social media, so please use the Indiegogo share tools!  Thank you so much!</p></div></div>","Short Summary

<h3>Darum geht es</h3>
<p>Romana Hasenöhrl, Serienbuchautorin und Schreiberin aus Leidenschaft wagt sich an ihren ersten Roman. Ein Teil dieser Sammlung an Reisegeschichten wurde bisher auf einem privaten Blog veröffentlicht und wird nun nach unzähligen Leseranfragen in einem Buch präsentiert und erweitert. Ganz in Blogmanier dürfen die Leserinnen und Leser sich einbringen und Fragen aller Art stellen, zum Beispiel (Auszug aus Leserfragen):</p>
<ul>
<li>Hast Du keine Angst, allein zu reisen?</li>
<li>Was, wenn es mal was mit dem Auto hat?</li>

<li>Geht der auch mal wieder oder bleibt der?</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Was Du davon hast</h3>
<p>In dieser Kampagne geht es um den Roman. Dieser Roman wird im Eigenverlag gedruckt und in Eigenregie vertrieben werden. Dazu braucht es ein wenig Budget. Die Reise ist ausfinanziert, mit Deinem Perk finanzierst Du keine Reise, sondern die Entstehung eines Romans!</p>
<ul>
<li>Mit 10.000 Euro Kapital können das layout und der Druck für 500 Exemplare finanziert werden sowie sinnvolle Marketingaktionen geplant und umgesetzt werden.</li>
<li>Du kannst Dich auf verschiedenste Art und Weise einbringen - einfach ein Buch bestellen. Oder aber eine Frage stellen, die im Buch vorkommen soll. Oder einen Motivationsvortrag buchen, der Deine Mitarbeiter zum Träumen animiert.</li>

<h3>Gibt es nicht schon genug Reisegeschichten?</h3>
<p>Reisegeschichten gibt es wie Sand am Meer. Reiseromane auch. Und Sachbücher sowieso. Doch kaum jemand schreibt darüber, was es neben den schönsten Sehenswürdigkeiten, den spannendsten Roadtrips und den wunderbarsten Begegnungen noch gibt: Den Reiseblues, der einen erfasst, wenn man zu viel alleine ist, die Angst vor dem Versagen des Fahrzeuges, das die Reise erst möglich macht und die Herausforderungen des Alleinreisens mit Hund. Dass man trotzdem wunderbare Begegnungen hat und am Ende jeder Reise ein Herz voller Geschichten - auch das wird thematisiert. Und zusätzlich bekommst Du:</p>
<ul>
<li>eine verdammt gute Reiseroute kreuz und quer durch Kanada und die USA</li>
<li>die besten Tipps zum Reisen mit Hund</li>
<li>Tipps für die schönsten Destinationen, wenn Du wirklich die Einsamkeit suchst</li>
<li>Tipps für die schönsten Destinationen, wenn Du die Einsamkeit überhaupt nicht suchst ;-)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risiken und Nebenwirkungen</h3>
<p>Was kann Dir passieren, wenn DU hier investierst?</p>
<p>Genaugenommen nichts. Der Roman ""Vom Reisen mit dem Blues"" wird auf jeden Fall entstehen. Sollte die für acht Monate geplante Reise nicht stattfinden oder früher als geplant beendet werden, wird dieses Buch trotzdem erscheinen - mit 250 Seiten Stories über all die Reisen, die der Blues bisher begleitet hat.</p>
<p>Nebenwirkungen: Es muss davor gewarnt werden, dass Du nach dem Lesen dieses Buches reisesüchtig werden könntest. Nichts und niemand wird Dich dann mehr aufhalten können!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Und wer ist dieser Blues überhaupt?</h3>
<p>Jeder kennt ihn. Jeder ist ihm schon einmal begegnet. Und er sieht bei jedem anders aus. Mein Blues ist ein Rüpel. Er legt beim Fahren im Auto seine Füße auf dem Armaturenbrett ab, raucht und spuckt aus dem Fenster. Wann immer er Lust darauf hat, kritisiert er mein Leben. Und plötzlich ist er verschwunden, manchmal für Tage, manchmal für Monate. Doch er kommt immer wieder, soviel ist sicher.</p>

<h3>Project Coordinator</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562534799/hsl1bw6gcm6b2q2rcstg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Hi, my name is Alison Neilson. I am an environmental educator and social scientist, and I am the coordinator of this project. For the past 11 years, I've studied the Azores fishing communities and the importance of their values, culture and knowledge for sustaining the oceans, wild fish and the future of their livelihoods. </p>
<p>Collaborating with islanders and their associations, we've been gathering photos and recording interviews with people who use artisanal and small-scale fishing methods in the deep waters of the open sea. They have told us stories of their friends and families, of joys and sorrows and their hopes and dreams. </p>
<p>Through vibrant words and images, these narratives interweave a contemporary portrait of fishers and the way they strive with a fierce tenacity to create a future of their own in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. We want to ensure that these narratives are preserved, and this heritage is celebrated not lost.</p>
<p>Through this crowdfunding campaign we strive to create educational materials as well as a collection of images and information freely available to be used by individuals and associations in the islands.</p>
<p>Our dream is to create a full-colour book highlighting all nine islands, published in English and Portuguese versions, and available world-wide.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>* Help make the book a reality *</strong></h2>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Proceeds from book sales will support Azorean fishing communities</strong></h2>
<h3>We are fishers, educators and researchers</h3>
<p>I am honoured to lead this project which builds on multiple collaborations with fishers and their associations. Each island has their own fishing association and some groups such as the Federation of Azores Fisheries (Federação das Pescas dos Açores), and the Association for Women Fishers (Ilhas em Rede), represent people on all nine islands. Lists of all participating associations, past projects and other publications can be found <a href=""https://nineislands.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563022406/hrtxy3yeqjwvirwnzgxo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>We draw from our experiences and training as storytellers, educators and social scientists, to share a contemporary portrait of artesanal fishers who strive to survive global forces in the middle of the ocean.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1563023441/m8nq4sxbar8diaczozp7.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In-depth academic research along with hundreds of hours of volunteer time by fishers, their families and friends have build a wealth of important knowledge. This initiative will make use of this significant effort already undertaken and create a valuable database of interviews and photos, as well as other accessible materials to be used in schools, museums and other educational projects. </p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p>Through the personal stories of those who live with the daily consequences of less fish, reduced quotas and regulations that serve large industrial-scale fishing, we learn about the economic and political realities of small fishing communities.</p>
<p> </p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Around the world, more than 90% of fishing people use sustainable methods, yet their struggle to survive remains untold. Despite threatened, they are very much alive and kicking. </p>
<p>This project delivers:</p>
<p><strong>A Connection to the sea</strong> and our food via a spotlight into the everyday lives of people otherwise invisible against the international stories of overfishing</p>
<p><strong>An introduction to</strong> <strong>people</strong> who chose to live in tune with ocean ecosystems in order to gather the last global source of wild food</p>
<p><strong>A Discovery of hope </strong>amongst the common narratives of environmental destruction and crisis that there still exists working solutions</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have successfully produced numerous <a href=""https://nineislands.wordpress.com/academic-publications/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">academic publications</a> as well as locally available <a href=""https://nineislands.wordpress.com/other-publications/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">books</a>. We have also <a href=""https://nineislands.wordpress.com/other-projects/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">trained teachers and facilitated gathering of fisher and scientists</a>. We now seek to share this information with a broader audience. We want to increase the possibilities for a not-too-distant future where we could eat fish knowing that there are healthy populations in the ocean and where fishing communities could continue to exist in a sustainable manner with high levels of well-being.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Proceeds from book sales will support Azorean fishing communities</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Design and editing expertise is important to create publications which are meaningful and effective for education. The aesthetics and how words are used are vital for respecting local knowledge and for making the narratives accessible across languages and cultures. Working in both Portuguese and English and with dialects and expressions unique to the different Azorean islands, creates challenges for translation.</p>
<p>We have a multi-stage plan to meet our goals. Success at each step allows us to have an impact by being able to create different types of materials and increasingly produce quantities of these publications.</p>
<p><strong>up to €5000 raised - </strong>Since we already have a collection of photos and draft text for the book, donations will increasingly cover the costs of improved text and photo editing, translation, design and other preparations and allow us to share with people in the islands and to contributors of this campaign:</p>
<ul>
<li>Digital versions of full colour books in English and Portuguese version</li>
<li>Printed postcards, photo prints and other small publications </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Campaign goal of €20,000 - </strong>This will allow us to create multiple small publications and distribute printed books to schools, libraries, fishing associations, and other relevant Azorean and Portuguese institutions as well as to the individuals who contributed to the content of the book. These publications will also be available to the contributors to this crowdfunding campaign.</p>
<p>Meeting the goal will allow this campaign to go into In-demand after the crowdfunding campaign closes. This will allow additional people to donate and receive perks. </p>

Project Coordinator

Hi, my name is Alison Neilson. I am an environmental educator and social scientist, and I am the coordinator of this project. For the past 11 years, I've studied the Azores fishing communities and the importance of their values, culture and knowledge for sustaining the oceans, wild fish and the future of their livelihoods. 
Collaborating with islanders and their associations, we've been gathering photos and recording interviews with people who use artisanal and small-scale fishing methods in the deep waters of the open sea. They have told us stories of their friends and families, of joys and sorrows and their hopes and dreams. 
Through vibrant words and images, these narratives interweave a contemporary portrait of fishers and the way they strive with a fierce tenacity to create a future of their own in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. We want to ensure that these narratives are preserved, and this heritage is celebrated not lost.
Through this crowdfunding campaign we strive to create educational materials as well as a collection of images and information freely available to be used by individuals and associations in the islands.
Our dream is to create a full-colour book highlighting all nine islands, published in English and Portuguese versions, and available world-wide.
* Help make the book a reality *
Proceeds from book sales will support Azorean fishing communities
We are fishers, educators and researchers
I am honoured to lead this project which builds on multiple collaborations with fishers and their associations. Each island has their own fishing association and some groups such as the Federation of Azores Fisheries (Federação das Pescas dos Açores), and the Association for Women Fishers (Ilhas em Rede), represent people on all nine islands. Lists of all participating associations, past projects and other publications can be found here.

 
We draw from our experiences and training as storytellers, educators and social scientists, to share a contemporary portrait of artesanal fishers who strive to survive global forces in the middle of the ocean.
 

 
In-depth academic research along with hundreds of hours of volunteer time by fishers, their families and friends have build a wealth of important knowledge. This initiative will make use of this significant effort already undertaken and create a valuable database of interviews and photos, as well as other accessible materials to be used in schools, museums and other educational projects. 
 

 
Through the personal stories of those who live with the daily consequences of less fish, reduced quotas and regulations that serve large industrial-scale fishing, we learn about the economic and political realities of small fishing communities.
 
small-scale fisheries
A sustainable way of living
A proud Azorean heritage 
 
 

Every donation counts

A multistage approach to success 
You can join our team and help to increase the impact of this incredible community effort.
Specifically, your donation will be used to obtain the necessary professional editing and design for the text and the images, and the cost of producing a selection of publications including postcards, educational brochures as well as a 250+ page book.
You too can receive these stunning photo narratives!
 

 

The Impact
Around the world, more than 90% of fishing people use sustainable methods, yet their struggle to survive remains untold. Despite threatened, they are very much alive and kicking. 
This project delivers:
A Connection to the sea and our food via a spotlight into the everyday lives of people otherwise invisible against the international stories of overfishing
An introduction to people who chose to live in tune with ocean ecosystems in order to gather the last global source of wild food
A Discovery of hope amongst the common narratives of environmental destruction and crisis that there still exists working solutions
 
We have successfully produced numerous academic publications as well as locally available books. We have also trained teachers and facilitated gathering of fisher and scientists. We now seek to share this information with a broader audience. We want to increase the possibilities for a not-too-distant future where we could eat fish knowing that there are healthy populations in the ocean and where fishing communities could continue to exist in a sustainable manner with high levels of well-being.
* Help make the book a reality *
Proceeds from book sales will support Azorean fishing communities

Risks & Challenges
Design and editing expertise is important to create publications which are meaningful and effective for education. The aesthetics and how words are used are vital for respecting local knowledge and for making the narratives accessible across languages and cultures. Working in both Portuguese and English and with dialects and expressions unique to the different Azorean islands, creates challenges for translation.
We have a multi-stage plan to meet our goals. Success at each step allows us to have an impact by being able to create different types of materials and increasingly produce quantities of these publications.
up to €5000 raised - Since we already have a collection of photos and draft text for the book, donations will increasingly cover the costs of improved text and photo editing, translation, design and other preparations and allow us to share with people in the islands and to contributors of this campaign:

Digital versions of full colour books in English and Portuguese version
Printed postcards, photo prints and other small publications 

 
Campaign goal of €20,000 - This will allow us to create multiple small publications and distribute printed books to schools, libraries, fishing associations, and other relevant Azorean and Portuguese institutions as well as to the individuals who contributed to the content of the book. These publications will also be available to the contributors to this crowdfunding campaign.
Meeting the goal will allow this campaign to go into In-demand after the crowdfunding campaign closes. This will allow additional people to donate and receive perks. 
 
** News Flash: A major gift **

I'm a cookbook author and writer and I'm creating a campaign to launch <i>For the Culture</i>, a biannual printed food magazine that celebrates Black women in food and wine. The stories in <i>For the Culture</i> will be about Black women throughout the diaspora, written by Black women and photographed and illustrated by Black women. It will be the first magazine of its kind.</p>
<p>Black women are the architects of cuisines and kitchens in the U.S. and in so many countries throughout the world and our stories about our expertise, experience and relationships to food do not get enough attention or coverage.  With your help, I want to change that. <i>For the Culture</i> will capture the moment and highlight what Black women are doing in food and beverages now, as well as honor the women on whose shoulders we stand.</p>
<p>This project is important to me because I got my first food job when I was 15 and went to culinary school in my early 20s and in all my time reading my favorite food magazines I never saw many women who look like me. Over the past several years I've met numerous Black women chefs, restaurateurs, farmers, food stylists, writers, bloggers, bakers, sommeliers, bartenders, food activists, entrepreneurs (and the list goes on) and I want to create a publication and a community that centers our stories and perspectives. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The fundraising goal for <i>For the Culture</i> is $40,000. Funds raised through this campaign will pay for:</p>
<p><strong>Content production:</strong> Paying writers, photographers, illustrators, graphic designers, a copy editor, a production assistant for their work, as well as paying for photo studios, equipment and travel.</p>
<p><strong>Magazine production:</strong> Paying the printer.</p>
<p><strong>Shipping:</strong> Paying for the magazine to be shipped from the printer to you, the readers.</p>
<p><strong>Reward production &amp; shipping: </strong>There are cute perks for contributing to this campaign (see the column to the right) and your support helps pay for the costs of creating and mailing rewards to you.</p>
<p><strong>Indiegogo's Slice: </strong>There is a 5% platform fee that Indiegogo charges for use of this platform. There is also a 2.9% transaction fee that Indiegogo charges.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Food is a major part of culture and Black women are historically and presently behind the scenes (and sometimes in the limelight) cooking food, growing it, serving it, writing and teaching about it. All people are welcome to support and enjoy <i>For the Culture</i>, however this project is especially valuable because it will be by, for and about Black women in food and wine.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There is an enormous amount of energy and good will to make <i>For the Culture</i> a success. One challenge will be which stories to choose because there are so many stories and Black women are a defining force in food and wine throughout the world. With that said, <i>For the Culture</i> is an embryo at this stage and there are risks and obstacles in developing any new project. As a funder for this project you will be informed of any snafu that may delay the magazine's production or getting you your reward for contributing. </p>
<p>If <i>For the Culture</i> doesn't reach its entire goal but raises enough to cover paying content contributors and printing, we will move forward with a smaller magazine and hold additional fundraisers to cover the balance.

My name is Klancy Miller. I'm a cookbook author and writer and I'm creating a campaign to launch For the Culture, a biannual printed food magazine that celebrates Black women in food and wine. The stories in For the Culture will be about Black women throughout the diaspora, written by Black women and photographed and illustrated by Black women.

Over the past several years I've met numerous Black women chefs, restaurateurs, farmers, food stylists, writers, bloggers, bakers, sommeliers, bartenders, food activists, entrepreneurs (and the list goes on) and I want to create a publication and a community that centers our stories and perspectives. 

What We Need & What You Get
The fundraising goal for For the Culture is $40,000. Funds raised through this campaign will pay for:

Magazine production: Paying the printer.
Shipping: Paying for the magazine to be shipped from the printer to you, the readers.
Reward production & shipping: There are cute perks for contributing to this campaign (see the column to the right) and your support helps pay for the costs of creating and mailing rewards to you.

By donating to this campaign you not only will be pre-ordering one or all of our initial three books, but will also be providing seed money to help launch this small, independent press and publish the long list of works in our hopper. </p><p><strong>LOST SOULS' STORY</strong></p><p>The seed of Lost Souls Press was planted when I set out to find a publisher for my first novel, and second book, <i>Behind the Slickrock Curtain</i>. I’ve published hundreds of newspaper and magazine articles, had one non-fiction book published in the traditional manner, and I’m working on a second. The process for fiction, on the other hand, proved to be an agonizing, interminable, ego-crushing process. And even if I did get a contract, it would take longer for the book to be published than it did to write the damned thing. It seemed as if this book — along with all the other novels I had planned — was doomed to languish in the realm of literary lost souls. </p><p>But I’m not one to give up so easily. Twenty years ago, my wife Wendy and I tried and failed to buy the <i>Silverton Standard &amp; the Miner</i> newspaper in Silverton, Colorado. Did we surrender? Nope, we just started our own publication. Why couldn’t I do the same, but with books? </p><p>And thus, Lost Souls Press sprouted, not only to rescue <i>Behind the Slickrock Curtain</i> from publishing Purgatory, but also the two novels that my father, Ian M. Thompson, wrote before he died two decades ago. Plus, I've got a bunch more books to write, myself, including a collection of essays and images, at least two more novels, and even a cookbook. Lost Souls Press will enable me to get these books out into the world of readers, where they belong. </p><p>That’s where you come in. Publishing isn’t free. Editing, design, marketing, and the oodles of coffee required to coax the words out of one’s brain and onto the page — it all costs money. I hope to raise enough up-front through pre-orders and donations to cover the basic costs of publishing our first three books:</p><p><i>Behind the Slickrock Curtain</i>: An environmental thriller starring Malcolm Brautigan, Eliza Santos, and Utah’s Canyon Country, by Jonathan P. Thompson, (Summer 2020). </p><p><i>The Wingate Project</i>: A sweeping historical novel based in the Four Corners Country, by Ian M. Thompson, (Fall 2020). </p><p><i>The Feral West: Writings and images from the home place</i>, by Jonathan P. Thompson (February 2021). </p><p>The proceeds from the sales of those books will then go toward publishing the other volumes in the hopper, including but certainly not limited to: </p><p><i>Black Snow: A former hobo reminisces about riding the rails, politics, and philosophy</i>, by James O. Aldrich</p><p><i>Better Than Keks Cookbook: Healing recipes for a f#$#ed up world</i>, by Jonathan P. Thompson </p><p><i>Snow Screen</i>: In which chem-trails, murder by avalanche, cloud-seeding, and small-town journalism collide. Starring Malcolm Brautigan, Eliza Santos, and the Woman with the СНЯГ tattoo.</p><p><i>Ortega</i>, a novel by Ian M. Thompson.</p><p><i>Carbon Colonies: The rise and fall of the fossil fuel empires in the Southwest</i>, non-fiction by Jonathan P. Thompson</p><p><i>Sonntag: The incredible true story of a German Jew who spent the War in Auschwitz and the American GI whom he befriended</i>, by Wendy Thompson and Jonathan P. Thompson. </p><p><i>Mine Pool</i>: An Eliza Santos and Malcolm Brautigan novel, by Jonathan P. Thompson</p><p><i>Pinhead Chronicles</i>: A steampunk novel based on the true story of Tesla, Telluride, the electrical grid, and Lucien L. Nunn, by Jonathan P. Thompson</p><p><strong>WHO ARE THESE LOST SOULS?</strong></p><p>I’m Jonathan P. Thompson, and I’m a writer — and editor, photographer, and artist. I am the author of <i>River of Lost Souls: The Science, Politics, and Greed Behind the Gold King Mine Disaster</i> (Torrey House, 2018), and I’m working on a second non-fiction book for Torrey House about southeastern Utah. I’ve been flinging words for a living since 1996, when I first got a job with the <i>Silverton Standard &amp; the Miner</i> newspaper in Silverton, Colorado. Since then I started my own publication, owned and ran the <i>Silverton Standard</i>, and have worked in a variety of capacities — including editor-in-chief — at <i>High Country News, </i>where I'm currently a contributing editor.</p><p><strong>THE $$ AND REWARDS</strong></p><p>The funds raised will help cover the costs associated with publishing the first three books, including: editing, copyediting, book design, coffee, cover design, software, art acquisition, coffee, ISBN numbers and bar codes, printer setup, printing, marketing, coffee, shipping, and book tour expenses. </p><p>This is a flexible funding goal, meaning that no matter how much is raised during the campaign, Lost Souls Press will publish these three books. If we fall short of the goal, it will just take a little more, let’s say, creativity (and coffee, albeit cheap coffee), on Jonathan’s part. If we go over the goal, it will ensure that we can publish more of the books on our list. That means that no matter how much you give, you’ll be doing your part to bring these works into the world.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>{ DIYdancer } magazine is an annual art journal telling stories from inside dance. Inside elegant layouts, and alongside striking photography, we share first person narratives and deep dive conversations into the creative process, from dancers and dancemakers around the world. { Dd } was co-founded by three professional dancers who were passionate about making things. As we began to meet the need for articulate and knowledgeable dance and arts coverage, we began adding dancer contributors from New York City to Los Angeles, Berlin, Atlanta, London, Minneapolis, Denver, Boston, San Francisco and more. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>'Issue 03 | SEEN unSEEN' is our biggest endeavor to date! Your contribution is crucial and along with it, you are guaranteed a digital and/or print copy of the magazine as well as a vote on our cover image!</p>
<p>With more contributors and more featured artists, telling more stories from inside the dance community, we have more beautiful pages for you to enjoy. But more of everything also means more costs:</p>
<p>$5k will help us offset some of our production and printing costs. If we surpass this number, it will enable us to print more and be able to make a bigger push into the wholesale marketplace!

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>""There is real life in these pages. Real humans, real dancers, sharing real work. The stories blew my mind and brought me to tears. Dance has been waiting for a publication like this, I've been waiting for a publication like this. A magazine that shapes moves into words for all of the movers. In a time where dance needs more voices not just faces, this journal speaks truth and connection. If you've ever felt alone in our world... read this."" —Haley Kostas, choreographer</p>
<p>{ DIYdancer } magazine is an annual print journal committed to highlighting first person stories of how dancers and dancemakers are doing what they do. We continually offer fresh perspectives on how other artists are collaborating with, and responding to, dance. Our elevated design and aesthetic bring gravitas to our celebration of this art form and its intersections. </p>
<p>With two issues already out in the world—on coffee tables and on the shelves of unique bookstores—we have a built up a track record for creating a publication that is special and timeless. </p>
<p>Haley's words reflect some of the high praise we have received from readers. But what we think is more important, is the relationship that has evolved between us and our readership. For example, after she read our second issue and her deep response to it, we got to know Haley, her choreography work and her writing. Over the last year, we have been evolving with her, through all sorts of highs and lows, to help her craft a personal essay for this third issue about the tough spots that happen inevitably in a creative and collaborative process. The hours and months that went into it, have not only created a superior draft, they have solidified our respect for one another as artists and storytellers from the dance community.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>{ DIYdancer } did not begin as a business, but rather a group of like-minded colleagues and friends who wanted to augment dance coverage with the voices and perspectives of the artists. The first issue of our print journal brought about the need to make this collective into a business. Thanks to some dedicated sponsors like MSeam Apparel, we have made it this far. But publishing in the age of free online content is a challenging market to find ourselves in. Nonetheless, we believe in the value of our contributor's voices, time spent editing and perfecting a story, and creating the most sublime form to view it in.

</div></div>","Short Summary
{ DIYdancer } magazine is an annual art journal telling stories from inside dance. Inside elegant layouts, and alongside striking photography, we share first person narratives and deep dive conversations into the creative process, from dancers and dancemakers around the world. { Dd } was co-founded by three professional dancers who were passionate about making things. As we began to meet the need for articulate and knowledgeable dance and arts coverage, we began adding dancer contributors from New York City to Los Angeles, Berlin, Atlanta, London, Minneapolis, Denver, Boston, San Francisco and more. 

What We Need & What You Get
'Issue 03 | SEEN unSEEN' is our biggest endeavor to date! Your contribution is crucial and along with it, you are guaranteed a digital and/or print copy of the magazine as well as a vote on our cover image!
With more contributors and more featured artists, telling more stories from inside the dance community, we have more beautiful pages for you to enjoy. But more of everything also means more costs:
$5k will help us offset some of our production and printing costs. If we surpass this number, it will enable us to print more and be able to make a bigger push into the wholesale marketplace! (And if we don't reach our goal, it simply means it will take longer for us to make it into the black.)
Each contribution comes with some form of 'Issue 03 | SEEN unSEEN,' whether in print or PDF. Larger contributions come with 'Issue 01 | collaboration + time' and 'Issue 02 | how to' and the possibility of shoutouts on our social media, website, and podcast. All contributions come with an opportunity to cast your vote on our cover image.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Henley Beckford</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581417402/bxdth7cghpa5l735kwlw.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am a solo father of one. Sadly, back in 2018, my partner passed away and we still don’t know the reason why but before she died, she gifted me with a best friend, my son Pharaoh. I took on the role of solo parent when he was 11 months old and like most parents, everything I do is for him.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581417763/m7duuq36w0m5n5nbiykv.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am worried and I have always been worried that ""if the worse were to happen to me, what message could I leave behind for him to have some form of guidance in life?"". Pharaoh was born in June 2017 and before he was born I launched my first blog as a secret love letter to him, in December 2016.</p>
<p>The Blog: 'Hue By Design' (<a href=""http://www.huebydesign.wordpress.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.huebydesign.wordpress.com</a>) was my inception of pouring out all my thoughts, feelings and findings for my son to see later in life. While I was writing with the foresight of ' what if the worse were to happen to me?', I couldn't imagine in a million years that it was my partner that would pass away and leave Pharaoh without a mother.</p>
<p>In all senses, It was poetic... But still heartbreaking nonetheless. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1581419442/dopwpf68ka5ugx8gba3w.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In December 2018, six months after she passed away, I wanted to share the journey of being a solo father with the world, so I launched a Youtube channel 'Just Beckford' (<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/justbeckford"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.youtube.com/justbeckford</a>) setting out to document in all transparency, the ups and downs of being a solo father.

<div> </div>
<p>While I enjoy all the creativity required speaking on all aspects of the narrative of the 'solo father', showcasing my vulnerabilities and hopefully adding value to anyone that could relate to similar situations, I felt and still feel compelled to do more. </p>
<p>So I started to write. I poured out my soul to explain to my son the type of person his mother and I dreamed for him to be. A person of integrity, who understands who he is and has a firm identity of self.  I broke down business, finance and a wealth of knowledge that I wish I had growing up. I took a step back and realised that I was writing a book. A book that I feel would and could radiate out and add value to all our communities.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Who is this book for? </h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p><strong>This book is for EVERYBODY!</strong> </p>
<p>This is a book for everyone, for young men and women needing inspiration and guidance in hopes to be the best versions of themselves, to the seasoned entrepreneur wanting to start more meaningful conversations.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>While the book is 'Black British centric', it provides context for readers outside of Britain, who want to gain a better insight into how Black Britain was created; interesting historical facts and findings, as well as, a serving of practical business information for the budding entrepreneur.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This book is a living breathing case study of not only Black affluent people, and the 'How to's' but a call to action for social responsibility. It touches on the mental impacts of becoming financially successful and the battle with 'survivor's remorse' that many affluent people feel coming from humble beginnings. It also provides insight into meaningful ways of giving back.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition to this, the book tackles 'The Black Paradigm'. It questions in both a methodological and philosophical way of 'What is Blackness?' dispelling and unpacking a world of trauma and false rhetoric created to bubble wrap the topic of race worldwide. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What drove me to write this book?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Subconsciously, it was my interests in history; economics; understanding my black identity and how the world works that led me to write within this point of view. I was fuelled off the back of traumatic situations that I personally faced while being raised in both a working-class; predominantly black and ethnic minority environment; attending a community college to suddenly moving to a middle class; predominantly white environment; attending an old boys’ grammar school but below are key points that have impacted my life the most:</p>
<ul>
<li>Partner of seven years unexpectedly passing away – 2018.</li>
<li>Younger brother fell victim to Knife Crime in London – 2014.</li>
<li>Elder brother diagnosed with ‘Psychosis’ a mental health problem.</li>
<li>My love for the communities that raised me</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>About The Book</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Chapters:</strong> </p>
<p>The book itself is broken down into eight chapters:</p>

<li>Generational Black Layering</li>

<h3>Bringing out your inner chef.</h3>
<p>I’ve always loved cooking; community, for me, in synonymous with the word. Food brings people together. But most people feel intimidated in the kitchen; cooking shows and social media has glorified cooking in such a way that the average person feels unable to make a simple dishworthy of eating. </p>
<p>My inner chef was born out of curiosity; imagine a young boy living in Liberia among Lebanese, Indian, and other West Africans who come together regularly to share food, drinks, and music.  Now, with 33 years of cooking experience spanning several continents, I give my readers the ability to cook either a single, simple dish, or create a few course dinner. </p>
<p>My cookbook seeks to bring out the curiosity of a novice; to draw out the researcher and give them the confidence to make dishes using simple ingredients, while following basic instructions.</p>
<p>The timing for this project is also ripe: plant based cuisine is on the upswing. I am a very practical chef who encourages people, especially those who might be new to the concept, to try vegetarian/ vegan foods in such a way that they can understand the wholesome nature of what they are cooking and eating. The more you know... . </p>
<p>Backers for this project will also have access to my knowledge of vegetable varieties, spice uses, cooking techniques, seasonal cooking, and many other skills I’ve learned along my journey. In some cases, like those who contribute substantial amounts, I will pay you a personal visit and cook with you and your family/ friends. </p>
<p>I would love to see this project backed in a community style, with groups of people coming together to make it happen; community, is where I learned to cook, and community is where I want to invest in. </p>
<p>As my gratitude for your backing, you’ll receive seats at my dinner tables when I’m in your area, personalized copies of my cookbook and other perks. </p>
<p>I understand that some may not be able to back this project financially, so for those who can’t, please share widely with other who might be able to. </p>
<p>I thank you again for your contribution, and look forward to learning, writing, cooking, and creating a community of inspired chefs. </p>

My cookbook seeks to bring out the curiosity of a novice; to draw out the researcher and give them the confidence to make dishes using simple ingredients, while following basic instructions.
The timing for this project is also ripe: plant based cuisine is on the upswing. I am a very practical chef who encourages people, especially those who might be new to the concept, to try vegetarian/ vegan foods in such a way that they can understand the wholesome nature of what they are cooking and eating. The more you know... . 
Backers for this project will also have access to my knowledge of vegetable varieties, spice uses, cooking techniques, seasonal cooking, and many other skills I’ve learned along my journey. In some cases, like those who contribute substantial amounts, I will pay you a personal visit and cook with you and your family/ friends. 
I would love to see this project backed in a community style, with groups of people coming together to make it happen; community, is where I learned to cook, and community is where I want to invest in. 
As my gratitude for your backing, you’ll receive seats at my dinner tables when I’m in your area, personalized copies of my cookbook and other perks. 
I understand that some may not be able to back this project financially, so for those who can’t, please share widely with other who might be able to. 
I thank you again for your contribution, and look forward to learning, writing, cooking, and creating a community of inspired chefs.

Book Club rights were acquired by Scholastic Books and it has sold almost 100,000 copies to date. It's a humbling honor to be able to say that there are close to 100,000 children in the world who have a copy of something I penned on their bookshelf. But I don't want to stop there, which is why I'm making it my personal crusade to see to it that as many children as possible are blessed with the experience of creating that everlasting bedtime story memory...and have I got the perfect bedtime story.</span><br/>
</h3>
<p><b>THE BEDTIME STORY EXPERIENCE</b></p><p>As a mother of four--three school-aged who attend three different schools (that means I'm at three different PTO meetings a month)--and on top of that being a work from home mom and wife, no matter how hectic, draining and bananas my day has been, come bedtime, my youngest--my seven year old--still expects me to end the night by tucking  him into bed with a good old fashion bedtime story. That's our thing. It's our time. It's our moment. Shouldn't every child own such a moment? If there's no other story we can pass down to future generations, it's how wonderful bedtime was because of that favorite bedtime story we read over and over and over again (without complaint on either end ;-). It just so happens that I want to create that tradition with a bedtime story about...well...bedtime.</p>
<p><b>ABOUT THE BOOK</b></p><p>Just like with <i>The Secret Olivia Told Me</i>, <i>When the Clock Strikes Eight</i> is a children's book that I wrote when my now 28 year old was around six. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Little one’s will think twice the next time they want to
stay up past their bedtime, especially on a school night! In </span><i style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">When the Clock Strikes Eight</i><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">, the kid in
this story learns the hard way that staying up past bedtime might seem like a
great idea in the midst of all the fun, but there will be a price to pay indeed
come morning.</span></p><p>The same way I waited fifteen years to dust off my Olivia manuscript and watch it become a part of so many children's lives, my prayer is for that same type of blessing to fall upon <i>When the Clock Strikes Eight</i>; one hundred fold! And just like with Olivia, the time is right. And, after all, timing is everything (no pun intended).</p>
<p><b>HOW YOUR DONATION CAN HELP</b></p><p>By donating toward this campaign, not only will I be able to get the book into production (pay an illustrator, designer for layout, editor, copyright, typesetter, printer, shipping cost, marketing, promotions, etc...), but I'll be able to personally visit children, shelters, libraries and schools all over the map to hold reading events and workshops. Can't you just see it now; kids getting to wear their pajamas to school/the library and bring their pillow-pet because author N. Joy is coming to read them a bedtime story? I do author visits and instruct workshops all over the map now with <i>The Secret Olivia Told Me</i>, but my heart desires to do it on a much larger scale...and much more often. My budget may not be able to accomplish such today, but my faith is certain about my achievements of tomorrow.</p><p>It's a must that I move forward, and this campaign is that vehicle to get me moving along. Things that don't move forward stagnate and die. Written words live and bring forth life, and I want to play a huge part in being the heartbeat of bringing back the family tradition of bedtime storytelling. </p>
<p><b>GREAT BEGINNING TO A VISION WITH NO END</b></p><p>Fifty thousand dollars will be a great start to the beginning of a vision that has no end. Books may have a literal ending, but the experience of the words live on forever in the imagination. Books live on forever, they are a legacy. No donation is too big or too small. A donation of at least $30 will get you two autographed copies of the first printed books hot off the shelf; one to keep for yourself or your child(ren) and one to bless another child with. Donate $500 and fifty copies will be donated to the school, shelter, library, organization of your choice. For a donation of $2000 or more, I will go to the school, shelter or library of your choice in the United States or Canada as a guest author. I will donate ten copies to that school/library/shelter as well as instruct my ""Kreative Kids Write!"" writing workshop. You can pre-order your autographed copy for $20.</p><p><b>WAYS YOU CAN HELP IN ADDITION OR OTHER THAN FINANCIALLY</b></p><p>Please don't get discouraged if your budget doesn't allow you to donate or pre-order the book. Any amount you can offer toward the campaign will go toward the production of the book and getting it into children's hands across the map. The more books that can be printed on a print run, the less expensive it is to produce a book, which makes it more feasible for families to obtain and more books organizations/donors can donate to charities, shelters, libraries and schools.</p>
<p>Even if you can't contribute financially, you can contribute by word of mouth. Tell your friends, family, coworkers, neighbors, schools, libraries, churches and PTA/PTO's about the <i>When the Clock Strikes Eight</i> campaign. You can even use the Indiegogo sharing tools to post on social media. <br/></p>
<p><b>BE WHO YOU WANT YOUR CHILDREN TO BE</b></p><p>I'm almost certain that the full goal amount will be achieved, but if it isn't, the funds that are raised will go toward the production of the book, and my team will still work  just as hard to promote what should be everyone's favorite pastime; bedtime with a bedtime story. We say reading is fundamental and education is important, well how are our children going to believe us if we won't even pick up a book ourselves...or gift them a book? Let's be who we want our children to be. Let's be readers, and let's make them readers as well.</p><p>Thank you in advance for your donation...and happy reading!</p>

Book Club rights were acquired by Scholastic Books and it has sold almost 100,000 copies to date. It's a humbling honor to be able to say that there are close to 100,000 children in the world who have a copy of something I penned on their bookshelf. But I don't want to stop there, which is why I'm making it my personal crusade to see to it that as many children as possible are blessed with the experience of creating that everlasting bedtime story memory...and have I got the perfect bedtime story.

THE BEDTIME STORY EXPERIENCEAs a mother of four--three school-aged who attend three different schools (that means I'm at three different PTO meetings a month)--and on top of that being a work from home mom and wife, no matter how hectic, draining and bananas my day has been, come bedtime, my youngest--my seven year old--still expects me to end the night by tucking  him into bed with a good old fashion bedtime story. That's our thing. It's our time. It's our moment. Shouldn't every child own such a moment? If there's no other story we can pass down to future generations, it's how wonderful bedtime was because of that favorite bedtime story we read over and over and over again (without complaint on either end ;-). It just so happens that I want to create that tradition with a bedtime story about...well...bedtime.
ABOUT THE BOOKJust like with The Secret Olivia Told Me, When the Clock Strikes Eight is a children's book that I wrote when my now 28 year old was around six. Little one’s will think twice the next time they want to
stay up past their bedtime, especially on a school night! In When the Clock Strikes Eight, the kid in
this story learns the hard way that staying up past bedtime might seem like a
great idea in the midst of all the fun, but there will be a price to pay indeed
come morning.The same way I waited fifteen years to dust off my Olivia manuscript and watch it become a part of so many children's lives, my prayer is for that same type of blessing to fall upon When the Clock Strikes Eight; one hundred fold! And just like with Olivia, the time is right. And, after all, timing is everything (no pun intended).
HOW YOUR DONATION CAN HELPBy donating toward this campaign, not only will I be able to get the book into production (pay an illustrator, designer for layout, editor, copyright, typesetter, printer, shipping cost, marketing, promotions, etc...), but I'll be able to personally visit children, shelters, libraries and schools all over the map to hold reading events and workshops. Can't you just see it now; kids getting to wear their pajamas to school/the library and bring their pillow-pet because author N. Joy is coming to read them a bedtime story? I do author visits and instruct workshops all over the map now with The Secret Olivia Told Me, but my heart desires to do it on a much larger scale...and much more often. My budget may not be able to accomplish such today, but my faith is certain about my achievements of tomorrow.It's a must that I move forward, and this campaign is that vehicle to get me moving along. Things that don't move forward stagnate and die. Written words live and bring forth life, and I want to play a huge part in being the heartbeat of bringing back the family tradition of bedtime storytelling. 
GREAT BEGINNING TO A VISION WITH NO ENDFifty thousand dollars will be a great start to the beginning of a vision that has no end. Books may have a literal ending, but the experience of the words live on forever in the imagination. Books live on forever, they are a legacy. No donation is too big or too small. A donation of at least $30 will get you two autographed copies of the first printed books hot off the shelf; one to keep for yourself or your child(ren) and one to bless another child with. Donate $500 and fifty copies will be donated to the school, shelter, library, organization of your choice. For a donation of $2000 or more, I will go to the school, shelter or library of your choice in the United States or Canada as a guest author. I will donate ten copies to that school/library/shelter as well as instruct my ""Kreative Kids Write!"" writing workshop. You can pre-order your autographed copy for $20.WAYS YOU CAN HELP IN ADDITION OR OTHER THAN FINANCIALLYPlease don't get discouraged if your budget doesn't allow you to donate or pre-order the book. Any amount you can offer toward the campaign will go toward the production of the book and getting it into children's hands across the map. The more books that can be printed on a print run, the less expensive it is to produce a book, which makes it more feasible for families to obtain and more books organizations/donors can donate to charities, shelters, libraries and schools.
Even if you can't contribute financially, you can contribute by word of mouth. Tell your friends, family, coworkers, neighbors, schools, libraries, churches and PTA/PTO's about the When the Clock Strikes Eight campaign. You can even use the Indiegogo sharing tools to post on social media. 
BE WHO YOU WANT YOUR CHILDREN TO BEI'm almost certain that the full goal amount will be achieved, but if it isn't, the funds that are raised will go toward the production of the book, and my team will still work  just as hard to promote what should be everyone's favorite pastime; bedtime with a bedtime story. We say reading is fundamental and education is important, well how are our children going to believe us if we won't even pick up a book ourselves...or gift them a book? Let's be who we want our children to be. Let's be readers, and let's make them readers as well.Thank you in advance for your donation...and happy reading!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

New York City Writers Network (NYCWN) is an organization that strives to connect and support the writers of New York City, on and offline. No one can relate to a writer’s journey like another writer, so NYCWN is growing a community to serve as a source of encouragement, inspiration, motivation, and information for those who share a love of the craft.With our Writers for Readers program, we’re also rallying for literacy in a big way. We strongly believe that the ability to write well is crucial, no matter your occupation or walk of life, and that reading more means writing better. Our goal is to get books into the hands of more readers, and enrich the reading experience, especially in kids and young adults. NYCWritersNetwork.org will serve as our starting point and our homebase. With the proceeds of this campaign, we’ll build and maintain a bigger and better site for our members, for readers, and for our programs and initiatives that strive to support them.For more information on NYCWN, our programs, and our goals, continue reading below.Thank you so much for your time, your support, and your donation!NYCWN is working to become the premier online destination for writers in New York City and beyond, a one-stop-shop for writers looking to share their work, meet and network with other writers, to give or receive advice, to stay up-to-date on all things writing and publishing related, and much more. Members range from writers and readers, to editors, designers, marketers, and literary agents. They are freelancers, industry professionals, published and unpublished, beginners and mavens. Some are looking to connect with other writers in their area, some are looking to exchange pages, some are looking to beta-read. Some are offering services, others are looking for services. But one thing we all share is a love of the craft, and a desire to support one another.The website will service as a digital home base for our members. All members will be searchable by on their neighborhood, preferred genre, services, and interest in the community. Are you looking for a copyeditor? A cover designer? A beta-reader? Are you looking for someone to join your writing group? Attend your event? Maybe you’re just after another pair of eyes for the chapters you’re working on. NYCWritersNetwork.org will be the place to start! NYCWN is more than a website, it’s a community. While we want our members to be able to keep in touch online, we hope to bring a lot of them together off. Through events such as write-ins, open-mic nights, and social nights, as well as workshops, seminars, and more, NYCWN will continue to provide members of our network and writers in the community with opportunities to meet, share, and support one another in person. NYCWN is also a huge advocate of literacy, and reaching more children and young adults to instill the love of reading and writing into the youth is a leading priority.

<p><strong>About Memories</strong></p>
<p>This is for the trans women who doubt ourselves, who internalise the lies we're force-fed every day, who once in a while need a break from the fight to be reminded just how true we really are.</p>
<p>This is for the femmes who are chronically reduced, called superficial and shallow and traitorous and reformist and artificial and fake and less good. We run the fucking world, never forget that.</p>
<p>This is for the sexual queers, the gays and lesbians and bisexuals and pansexuals and kinksters and the great swathe of society who do things differently. Our sex is beautiful and powerful, respect it and use it well.</p>
<p>This is for the hard working women who work 5 jobs and 70 hours a week or spend every day searching and trying to answer the impossible question of how much more we can give before we collapse again.</p>
<p>This is for the forest, burned and murdered. For the sea and the sky and the herbs. This is for the clouds of starlings who might still return if we just let them.</p>

<p>Imagine you had the ability to move through your own life, to revisit your own past and foresee your own future. Which events would you long to remember and which would you prefer to forget? Would you want to know what the future holds? Would you change it if you could?</p>
<p>This is the story of Ash, a trans woman and healer living in a corner of Europe controlled by a militarized state. Amidst the economic crash of the 2020s, this land, once a diverse centre for immigration and queerness saw the rise of a state-imposed monoculture of gender, sexuality, ability and race. Those that didn’t fit, known as the divergents, were imprisoned, expelled or worse.</p>
<p>Ash and her best friend and herbalist Pinar, long ago escaped the City, left behind their days of fighting State oppression, and are eking out a calmer life in the forest, ravaged by the effects of climate change. One day, Jason, a resistance fighter, arrives abruptly into their life, reigniting personal and political drives and they find themselves drawn back into the fight.</p>
<p>Joining trans and queer organisers, sex workers and other members of a hidden underclass, they risk everything to return to the City and face their oppressors. In this fight for dignity, self-determination and their survival, Ash’s ability to transcend time, a trait that until now she has considered her curse, turns out to be a more powerful weapon than anyone could have imagined.</p>
<p><strong>Excerpt</strong></p>
<p>Having no way to contact each other, their visits were always unplanned, always unexpected and yet somehow Ash and Pinar had never missed each other in the five years since they came to this land.</p>
<p>Ash knew that when she arrived, the kettle would already be boiling or a pot of soup would have just been taken off the fire in anticipation. It was as if somehow, when one of them left their home, the forest and the river themselves passed on the message and beckoned the other to stay at home, to leave the firewood collecting to later, to just sit and wait.</p>
<p>Ash disappeared into the high undergrowth as she walked along a narrow path of stomped-down plants they both maintained just by hiking back and forth every few days. Her back was wet with sweat and brambles scratched her arms, but she loved this walk and hummed quietly to herself.</p>
<p>It was almost completely dark when the path suddenly opened out and beyond her in the forest she could hear a kettle whistling. <i>Not a minute too soon</i>. As she turned the corner, she saw Pinar, sitting outside her home surrounded by candles, her green eyes glistening in the light. As gorgeous as ever, Ash noticed. Pin was only 15 years her younger, but sometimes, despite all that they had been through together, her friend seemed to radiate with youth. Her long hair cascaded over her dark, bare shoulders and she smiled.</p>
<p>“I had a feeling you might turn up today.”</p>
<p>Pinar stood up and waved at a candlelit wooden table and chairs laid out under an old oak. “I'll just get the kettle. Make yourself at home.”</p>
<p>She disappeared inside the little wooden cabin they had built together and soon returned with a tray full of home made snacks, a teapot and a pitcher of water.</p>
<p>“Here we go.” she said, bending to put the tray down on the table. She stood up and turned to hug her friend.</p>

<p><strong>Writing Against Invisibilisation</strong></p>
<p>Memories from the Edge is an exploration of exclusion, intimacy and power with the kind of characters who are quietly doing the real work and fighting the big fights but who are chronically invisibilised or at best misrepresented in mainstream media.  The stories of sex workers, trans women, healers and community organizers are almost universally mis-told, our contributions co-opted and our narratives erased.</p>
<p>Having these characters take central stage in a novel is a personal reclamation for me as a person who holds these identities.

<p>LIMINAL is a safe space for women and gender non-conforming writers and creators, a hub for the mixing of budding and accomplished artists and a center for creative community. WE ARE THE ONLY FEMINIST &amp; WOMANIST writing space in the United States.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479625529/x3fy4whp01eszeoanc4f.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We exist because there is a huge gap in the literary community, at the local level as well as national level. Women's stories are still not being told as often as men's are being told. Spaces are still not featuring women as frequently as they are men. Women of color, transwomen, and women with disabilities are almost completely absent from mainstream literary culture. We exist because this needs to change.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479625480/slwujdbpoan4wsdc47x9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Since opening in February of 2014, without the aid of start-up funds or investments of any kind, LIMINAL was created and build bit by bit outside of full-time 9-5 jobs, family obligations and the. occasional bit of self-care. Take a look at what we do!</p>

<p>Oakland is an influential city. It is also a city that is being rapidly developed. As such, supporting this campaign, you are supporting gender equity being a part of the national conversation on arts, artists, business sectors, and city planning and development.</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>There are women-owned businesses and the number of these is increasing, however, there are very few businesses that are owned and focus their services on women as a means of empowerment. This model is innovative and brave. It is placing women in the forefront as providers of entertainment, interpersonal services and as the stars of the show. The normalization of such a model would mean a very significant shift in business structure and the perception of women, on a national level.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1479627035/elswxouz8vi7tyyyhomg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>This is a project that makes a difference to all people. Women are a part of everyone's life in the familial sense, the social sense and in the realm of work. There are parts of ourselves, no matter what gender we identify as, that are more ""masculine"" or more ""feminine."" By contributing to the success of a business with women at its center, you are supporting the dialogues that are necessary to create a healthier society; one that engages in discussions about gender and gender norms, and their impacts. </li>
<li>Already, we have created a loyal local following and community. The East Oakland Space is all run by people who donate their time to keep the space open, filled with art and populated with people. </li>
<li>LIMINAL has its sights set on other national locations as well as international. With your help, we will continue to build a model that can be replicated in other cities and towns, empowering local communities to come together around the celebration of women's art and entrepreneurship and to create an alternative model to the male-dominated spheres we don't often question or even see clearly as heavily skewed representations.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>To make a dream into a reality is a risk. To create something out of nothing is another risk. There is always the chance that a business may not be sustainable, as it may not bring in enough money.  It is a risk to label a business feminist and womanist, as these are titles that still have much stigma around them.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am stubbornly passionate and driven.</li>
<li>This business model is not first and foremost about bringing in money, but about creating social change. The money earned only needs to be enough to keep it in existence for a while, while the time can be taken to build strong interpersonal practices and structures. The luxury of a labor of love is that the strength of its core is primary to the quick turn-around of profit. This creates a model for sustainability with the long term in mind. A strong alternate business model can be build and then replicated, which is where greater profits will come in.</li>
<li>My near availability (enabled by this campaign) and dedication  to the growing of this space provides me with the ability to continue to create systems that work, to participate in networking events, to create and maintain community around the space. I am already bringing in a deep connection to the local literary scenes, the women-centered groups of Oakland and have been working on securing partnerships with individuals and organizations to make sure that the space will be filled with people, the schedule will be filled with events, workshops, open work times, classes and performances. </li>
<li>The stigma is necessary to create dialogue. Change occurs through communication, understanding and growth. I am ready to deal with stigma, am already dealing with it, and am growing both personally and professionally everyday, in the face of the current state of our society.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Testimonials</h3>
<p>""The first time I went to Liminal I had no idea what to expect. And I was amazed: people shared their writing on the most intimate aspects of their lives: sexuality, disability, relationships, bodies, race....And I was privileged to share some of my art there later as well. It's a space where you can be courageous. It's a space to collaborate. It's a space to find people like you, who love beauty and words. It's a space to find people unlike you, who might look talk believe differently but, just like you, are living in some kind of tension and liminal space. This is the kind of space we need!""</p>

<p>""Today is my last day as writer in residence at Liminal. It has gone by quickly but I accomplished a few things.

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

</div><p> </p></div>","LIMINAL is a safe space for women and gender non-conforming writers and creators, a hub for the mixing of budding and accomplished artists and a center for creative community. WE ARE THE ONLY FEMINIST & WOMANIST writing space in the United States.

We exist because there is a huge gap in the literary community, at the local level as well as national level. Women's stories are still not being told as often as men's are being told. Spaces are still not featuring women as frequently as they are men. Women of color, transwomen, and women with disabilities are almost completely absent from mainstream literary culture. We exist because this needs to change.

Since opening in February of 2014, without the aid of start-up funds or investments of any kind, LIMINAL was created and build bit by bit outside of full-time 9-5 jobs, family obligations and the. occasional bit of self-care. Take a look at what we do!

LIMINAL holds seasonal writing workshops with sliding scale options to keep them accessible to a variety of people with different economic backgrounds. The workshops are all taught by local authors and educators. 

We have monthly potluck brunch readings entitled ""From All Points But the Center"" that feature 4-6 artists.

We have bi-monthly showcases of 10-15 feminist and womanist narrative artists.

Our work-study writers-in-residence keep the space open for co-writing hours and have helped to develop a core group of supportive women writers in the space and continue to support each other in a larger community of writers outside of the space.

We have developed a performance troupe...

and an aerial troupe.

We hold 24-hour writing challenges and write-ins.

We host allied readings with groups of writers and artists that are also marginalized in our society. We showcase local feminist and womanist artists.

We have developed a grant-writing committee to research and apply for more sustainable funding. We have made partnerships in the community that have led to programming in Downtown Oakland planned for the new year. Imagine what we could do if we had some funds!!!

What your donations will help us with:
1. Small improvements to the space that mean big changes in the comfort of the people who inhabit the space

Comfy, back-supporting seating $1400
Mini fridge for milk products to go in coffee and tea (which are always available!) $100
Vacuum $500
Projector $300
Liability Insurance (to keep us safe!) $1000
Aerial Crash Pad (prevent broken selves) $500
 
2. Promotional Materials to help us get the word out to more folks $2000
Seasonal Programs, distribution materials & flyers

3. Personnel 
Work/Study Manager
10 hours a week @ $20/hr for 52 weeks = 10,400
Publicist
10 hours a week @ $20/hr for 52 weeks = 10,400
If we do not reach our entire goal, the funds will be used for the above listed categories, with equal percentages of the total raised going to each.
If we exceed our goals, funds will be used to create a sponsored retreat for writers who are working class or living on or below the poverty line. 

LIMINAL needs to be a larger part of the local and national conversation. We can increase our reach, influence and visibility, outreach, and community partnership development with your help.

Oakland is an influential city. It is also a city that is being rapidly developed. As such, supporting this campaign, you are supporting gender equity being a part of the national conversation on arts, artists, business sectors, and city planning and development.
 
The Impact
There are women-owned businesses and the number of these is increasing, however, there are very few businesses that are owned and focus their services on women as a means of empowerment. This model is innovative and brave. It is placing women in the forefront as providers of entertainment, interpersonal services and as the stars of the show. The normalization of such a model would mean a very significant shift in business structure and the perception of women, on a national level.


This is a project that makes a difference to all people. Women are a part of everyone's life in the familial sense, the social sense and in the realm of work. There are parts of ourselves, no matter what gender we identify as, that are more ""masculine"" or more ""feminine."" By contributing to the success of a business with women at its center, you are supporting the dialogues that are necessary to create a healthier society; one that engages in discussions about gender and gender norms, and their impacts. 
Already, we have created a loyal local following and community. The East Oakland Space is all run by people who donate their time to keep the space open, filled with art and populated with people. 
LIMINAL has its sights set on other national locations as well as international. With your help, we will continue to build a model that can be replicated in other cities and towns, empowering local communities to come together around the celebration of women's art and entrepreneurship and to create an alternative model to the male-dominated spheres we don't often question or even see clearly as heavily skewed representations.


Risks & Challenges
To make a dream into a reality is a risk. To create something out of nothing is another risk. There is always the chance that a business may not be sustainable, as it may not bring in enough money.  It is a risk to label a business feminist and womanist, as these are titles that still have much stigma around them.

I am stubbornly passionate and driven.
This business model is not first and foremost about bringing in money, but about creating social change. The money earned only needs to be enough to keep it in existence for a while, while the time can be taken to build strong interpersonal practices and structures. The luxury of a labor of love is that the strength of its core is primary to the quick turn-around of profit. This creates a model for sustainability with the long term in mind. A strong alternate business model can be build and then replicated, which is where greater profits will come in.
My near availability (enabled by this campaign) and dedication  to the growing of this space provides me with the ability to continue to create systems that work, to participate in networking events, to create and maintain community around the space. I am already bringing in a deep connection to the local literary scenes, the women-centered groups of Oakland and have been working on securing partnerships with individuals and organizations to make sure that the space will be filled with people, the schedule will be filled with events, workshops, open work times, classes and performances. 
The stigma is necessary to create dialogue. Change occurs through communication, understanding and growth. I am ready to deal with stigma, am already dealing with it, and am growing both personally and professionally everyday, in the face of the current state of our society.

Testimonials
""The first time I went to Liminal I had no idea what to expect. And I was amazed: people shared their writing on the most intimate aspects of their lives: sexuality, disability, relationships, bodies, race....And I was privileged to share some of my art there later as well. It's a space where you can be courageous. It's a space to collaborate. It's a space to find people like you, who love beauty and words. It's a space to find people unlike you, who might look talk believe differently but, just like you, are living in some kind of tension and liminal space. This is the kind of space we need!""

<h3>The Zen of Recovery</h3>

<p>Twenty-five years ago, <strong>The Zen of Recovery</strong> forever changed the face of 12-step recovery. The first work to incorporate Asian wisdom traditions with the 12 steps of AA, <strong>The Zen of Recovery </strong>has stayed in print for 25 years and has been used with great success by thousands seeking wellness on their own terms. Not merely another Zen book, <strong>The Zen of Recovery</strong> is a wide open self-help program that has benefited people in all sorts of recovery and with all sorts of beliefs or even none at all.</p>
<p>Written out of my own experience as a recovering person who was uncomfortable with the religious and patriarchal aspects of the 12-steps, <strong>The Zen of Recovery</strong> has given permission to many thousands to become who they really are, freed of dogma and limiting belief systems. My work is about a lot more than simple recovery from an addiction: the aim is nothing less than the recovery of our original, shining human nature and the attainment of our full potential.</p>
<p><strong>The Zen of Recovery</strong> is also available in e-book and audio formats and at most bookstores, including Amazon.</p>
<h3>The Sequel: Zen Mind, Recovery Heart</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519593657/w0ndtw9kgyvmo2c0wyeh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Twenty-five years in the making, <strong>Zen Mind, Recovery Heart</strong> is the worthy successor to <strong>The Zen of Recovery</strong> and reflects the changes we've all experienced during that time. Written in the same friendly, conversational stye as the first book, the sequel is divided into two parts. The first, <strong>Zen Mind</strong>, is similar to the first book, composed of essays and reflections on the process of recovery and awakening.</p>
<p>The second part, <strong>Recovery Heart</strong>, is based upon the hundreds of workshops, talks and retreats I have led throughout the country during the last decades. It contains easy directions for a do-it-yourself workshop including forms of meditation, art, writing, step work, tea ceremony and guided meditations all tailored to be effective in recovery work. The second half also includes contributions from readers of the first book and workshop attendees describing how they pursue recovery based upon <strong>The Zen of Recovery</strong>. The book is heavily illustrated with my Zen ink paintings and calligraphy.</p>
<p>Your contribution will make <strong>Zen Mind, Recovery Heart</strong> a reality and help continue the work of saving all beings from suffering. Plus, it's a very cool book! Take it from Mu.</p>

<p>I entered recovery in 1983 and have had uninterrupted sobriety for 35 years. The same year, I undertook formal Zen training at a Korean-style Zen center and studied under the renowned Zen master Seung Sahn. In 1988, Seung Sahn ordained me as a Dharma teacher, giving me the Buddhist name Jeong Mu Poep Sa, meaning Clear Emptiness Dharma Teacher. These days, I also go by the name ""Mu"", always reminding me of the goal to which I aspire: to empty myself of ego and grasping and to exist in this world just as it is.</p>
<p>I eventually left the Zen center to become involved with the First Unitarian Universalist Church of Providence where I was mentored by Rev. Tom Ahlburn, a student of Buddhism and friend to those in recovery. The church taught no dogma except that of attaining our human nature and was composed of atheists, secular Jews, pagans, 12-steppers,liberal Christians and LGBTQ members.</p>
<p>It was during my time with Tom that I wrote <strong>The Zen of Recovery </strong>and changed my life forever, fulfilling the promises of the program. I also wrote and published two more books: <strong>Shaving the Inside of Your Skull: Crazy Wisdom for Becoming Who You Really Are</strong> and <strong>Beat Spirit: The Way of the Beat Writers as a Living Experience</strong>. All my previous books were published by Jeremy Tarcher, an imprint of Putnam/Penguin and can be viewed at my Amazon author page. I also contributed articles to magazines such as <strong>Yoga Journal </strong>and <strong>Magical Blend</strong>. <strong>Playboy</strong> magazine, reviewing one of my books, said,""Let Ash drive you sane.""</p>
<p>I am also a professional artist and worked for years as an art director, graphic designer and  illustrator. Other experiences include stints as a reporter for weekly and daily newspapers and being a mental health counseler. All my work and teaching is inspired by my life as a creative person who has always sought to embrace and promote counter-cultural values in the hopes of making a better world.  Will you help with the Great Work?</p>
<p>I now live in Northern California where I continue to write, make art, lead study groups, perform spoken word and be available to students seeking to recover their full potential. It is my hope that with the publication of the long-awaited and requested<strong> Zen Mind, Recovery Heart</strong>, I will be able to return to teaching full-time and help contribute to the creating of the new world we all so desperately seek.</p>

<h3> Summary</h3>
<p>     I grew up being a captain of corporate America and spent over a decade of my life working for fortune 500 companies and would have never considered my self a weed person.  That all changed when I was presented with an opportunity to work in the legal weed industry.  I didn't just start out as a bud tender in a shop, but as a bonafide middle and connecting growers/producers with store fronts.  I was a complete outsider and hadn't even smoked weed until I was already working in the industry.  I dropped into the weed industry at a Walter White level instead of starting like a Jesse Pinkman.  </p>
<p>     It was a comedy of errors.  It was a miss adventure.  I gained so much and lost so much.  I also had some inherent flaws in our own legal system, bank system, us postal system, etc revealed to me over the course of the year which were eye opening.  I was stabbed.  I was held up at gun point.  When shit hit the fan I was threatened by people who I thought were friends and almost a new family.  If marijuana was treated like the Alcohol industry or Pharmaceutical Drug industry 95% of all the things I went through might never of happened to me.  This has made me into an activist know that if change happens none of what I went through will happen again to someone else.</p>
<p>     I spent a year trying to find a publisher for my story.  I discovered that my story was so unique that all the literary agents who read the sample chapters told me they loved the story but had no idea how they could or if they could properly represent and sell my story.  So here I am with a completed book, tons of great feed back, and no traditional avenues to pursue to get the book traditionally published.  This is why I am turning to Indiegogo for help. </p>
<p>     I could throw the book up on Amazon tomorrow and have a digital book out of sale but I want to use this book as a tool for my activism of the industry.  Being able to visit states that have Marijuana votes coming up and hand out books to senators and representatives of those states has far more gravity then giving them a redemption code for Amazon.  Having a book gives me a great tool as an activist.  Over the next 2 years there are 18 states that will have some kind of Marijuana vote.  By raising these funds and publishing this book, I will be able to take my story on the road to these states and become a part of the conversation of legalization in those states and nationwide.  Marijuana legalization means a alternative to opioids, ending harsh imprisonment of non violent offenders with drug charges, an amazing hemp market place that could trump cotton and paper, and many more reason.  I want to be a part of the conversation and this book is the first step.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need to sell the first 1000 copies of my book to raise money to fund my activism of the industry and establish my book with a printing company. The book will retail for $15 once its available to the general public but by pre ordering and joining the campaign to publish this book you will get some nice perks and a chance to help support a pro-marijuana activism in this country.  So here are the levels and benefits for supporting the campaign.</p>
<p>$1 - Tier 1 - Keep Me Informed (Unlimited)</p>
<p>Follow this campaign but supporting it.  You will receive updates on this campaign and be notified when its completed and also when the book available to the public.</p>

</div></div>","Summary
     I grew up being a captain of corporate America and spent over a decade of my life working for fortune 500 companies and would have never considered my self a weed person.  That all changed when I was presented with an opportunity to work in the legal weed industry.  I didn't just start out as a bud tender in a shop, but as a bonafide middle and connecting growers/producers with store fronts.  I was a complete outsider and hadn't even smoked weed until I was already working in the industry.  I dropped into the weed industry at a Walter White level instead of starting like a Jesse Pinkman.  
     It was a comedy of errors.  It was a miss adventure.  I gained so much and lost so much.  I also had some inherent flaws in our own legal system, bank system, us postal system, etc revealed to me over the course of the year which were eye opening.  I was stabbed.  I was held up at gun point.  When shit hit the fan I was threatened by people who I thought were friends and almost a new family.  If marijuana was treated like the Alcohol industry or Pharmaceutical Drug industry 95% of all the things I went through might never of happened to me.  This has made me into an activist know that if change happens none of what I went through will happen again to someone else.
     I spent a year trying to find a publisher for my story.  I discovered that my story was so unique that all the literary agents who read the sample chapters told me they loved the story but had no idea how they could or if they could properly represent and sell my story.  So here I am with a completed book, tons of great feed back, and no traditional avenues to pursue to get the book traditionally published.  This is why I am turning to Indiegogo for help. 
     I could throw the book up on Amazon tomorrow and have a digital book out of sale but I want to use this book as a tool for my activism of the industry.  Being able to visit states that have Marijuana votes coming up and hand out books to senators and representatives of those states has far more gravity then giving them a redemption code for Amazon.  Having a book gives me a great tool as an activist.  Over the next 2 years there are 18 states that will have some kind of Marijuana vote.  By raising these funds and publishing this book, I will be able to take my story on the road to these states and become a part of the conversation of legalization in those states and nationwide.  Marijuana legalization means a alternative to opioids, ending harsh imprisonment of non violent offenders with drug charges, an amazing hemp market place that could trump cotton and paper, and many more reason.  I want to be a part of the conversation and this book is the first step.

What We Need & What You Get
I need to sell the first 1000 copies of my book to raise money to fund my activism of the industry and establish my book with a printing company.

<h3>What We Are Making</h3>
<p>We're crafting a quarterly magazine, featuring artists from and connected to Oshawa and the Durham Region. Designed to be digestible, approachable and collectible, we'll print short stories, poetry, art, cartoons and export our magazine to cafes, bookstores and comic shops across Ontario. We've got businesses in Guelph, Kingston, Kitchener, Barrie, Newmarket, Peterborough and beyond already excited to provide this publication to their customers.</p>
<p>With the help of Slowcity.ca we aim to connect and support artists, build our community, and promote the amazing work being done in our area.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We're asking for donations of $10. For that you will receive the first issue of the magazine, shipped directly to your door. We're also throwing in some surprises. Consider it a loot bag of Durham arts goodies.</p>
<p>Your $10 donation will pay for the printing costs and shipping. Extra funds will be paid to the contributors of the magazine and go to support future issues.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why</h3>
<p>When you think of Oshawa and the Durham Region, what comes to mind? If you're outside looking in, you've heard of our GM Plant. You might know someone who attends Durham College or UOIT. We're the neighbours east of Toronto, an endless sea of suburbs, with a struggling downtown, giant shopping mall and plazas on every corner. You see us on the news when there's a fire or major crime.</p>
<p>But we're also an incubator for incredible art. Perhaps the monotony of cookie-cutter, new development homes breeds a certain need to express oneself. Maybe it's the border on farmlands, forests and water that keeps us connected and longing for escape. There's music here, blasting from the skeletal remains of venues still raising young musicians to support each other, to create and thrive.</p>
<p>And there's artists, writers and poets--a plethora, making unique works with powerful voices and rarely a platform to stand on.</p>
<p>Wunderlit is here to provide that platform.</p>
<p>Perhaps the notion of the ""ol'dirty Shwa"" will step aside, with readers taking notice of the creativity flourishing here. Perhaps we won't just be the auto factory and bland housing, but a thriving artistic scene that's worth visiting--worth experiencing!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We need your continual support. This campaign just scratches the surface, as we're only raising funds for the first issue of Wunderlit. If you like what you read, support us again to see future issues made. We'll shower you with more goodies.</p>
<p>We also need more contributors. If you write, or draw, or paint, go to <a href=""http://www.slowcity.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.slowcity.ca</a> and contact us. If you know an artist, point them in our direction, we want to show off their work.</p>

<h3>Hi, I am D. K. Marley!</h3>
<p>I am a historical fiction author and blogger, a graduate of the Writer's Retreat Workshop hosted by founder Gary Provost, and an avid Shakespearean. Through many many years of research, editing, travel trips to England and Stratford-upon-Avon, my novel ""Blood and Ink"" finally came to fruition. This book is my passion, my heart, and tears, and after indie-publishing to maintain my own voice in the words, I sought to add an Audible production to the ebook and paperback versions.</p>
<p>This brings me to why this campaign is so important to me. Not for myself, but for an incredible actor who reached out to me to narrate ""Blood and Ink"" for an audiobook production. His name is Jonathan C. Dixon and he has brought the characters from my novel to life in a way I could never have imagined. For years, for nearly 15 years, the characters voices resounded in my own mind, but now they are coming to life in the voice of Jon Dixon.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528510234/asn2vmapbbz2jvhq37zb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you will help support a great actor and a man of outstanding character, as he completes my novel, and hopefully will find more support, gigs, and fans for his amazing skills. The total amount I am seeking here is for his studio time/promotion, I am not seeking any money for myself since, as the author, my own marketing and promotion is on my own shoulders. I want to do this for Jon, and I hope you will support me in this quest. Come on... pay it forward!!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need and Where It Is Going</h3>
<p>More detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Seeking $2000 for studio time for Mr. Dixon to complete the audiobook production.</li>
<li>You can donate what you will or you can click a PERK to receive rewards for your donation.</li>
<li>Rewards? YES! I am offering signed copies of my novel, along with the completed digital audiobook; plus some promotional swag (t-shirts, jewelry...)</li>
<li>All proceeds, (minus minor expenses to assure deliverance of perk rewards and fees to Indiegogo) whether the goal is met or not, will go to Mr. Dixon to cover his costs of studio time and promotion of the audiobook.</li>

<h3>Let Me Tell You About Jon.... (by Mark Vine)</h3>
<p> I have known Jon Dixon and have been blessed to call him a good friend, for about twenty-five years.  We used to re-enact the English Civil War period together as part of the English Civil War Society. He was also a superb cricketer in his day and held several local records.  </p>
<p>Jon is the type of person on whom you can rely completely. When the chips are down, he is always the first to offer help as I have found out on more than one occasion. </p>
<p>He is very self-effacing and really does not know just how talented he is as an actor, a skill which he dabbled in during his early days, but which I saw the potential immediately when putting together the Crabchurch Conspiracy Weekend, which we now jointly run.  </p>
<p>So when I saw the historical author D. K. Marley advertising for someone to narrate her excellent new novel, ""Blood and Ink,"" based on the life of Christopher Marlowe, I knew there was only one man for the job and ‘bullied’ Jon into applying. </p>
<p>As ever, full of self-doubt, he was chosen out of a field of six or seven other actors to bring the author’s words to life as an audiobook and this crowdfunding exercise is to fund the studio fees of such a project. </p>
<p>Please give as much as you can and help this lovely man to achieve his considerable potential and hopefully, set him off on a new career path.  </p>

She was writing about the world around her, and it became her way of expressing emotions that are sometimes difficult to express in any other way. Thankfully, she was encouraged to write by everyone, from school teachers to her family and friends. At the age of sixteen, for the first time, she had the idea to publish the book of poems. Fast forward to 20 years later - she lived in three different countries, worked in over 15 companies, met over 500 people and had at least 10 failures and six times more episodes of pure happiness, Iva decided now is the damn time to publish the poems. </p><p> </p><p><strong>How can you support my project?</strong></p><p>Here is the deal - to successfully publish 200 examples of my book through <a href=""https://www.blurb.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Blurb </a>platform, I need 3,000 euros. Unfortunately, the full amount of the print costs is too high for me to pay it on my own. </p><p>Here is the breakdown of the costs: </p><ul>
<li>Print costs: 2 800 euros</li>
<li>Additional costs (design, marketing, delivery): 200 euros</li>

She was writing about the world around her, and it became her way of expressing emotions that are sometimes difficult to express in any other way. Thankfully, she was encouraged to write by everyone, from school teachers to her family and friends. At the age of sixteen, for the first time, she had the idea to publish the book of poems. Fast forward to 20 years later - she lived in three different countries, worked in over 15 companies, met over 500 people and had at least 10 failures and six times more episodes of pure happiness, Iva decided now is the damn time to publish the poems.  How can you support my project?Here is the deal - to successfully publish 200 examples of my book through Blurb platform, I need 3,000 euros. Unfortunately, the full amount of the print costs is too high for me to pay it on my own. Here is the breakdown of the costs: 
Print costs: 2 800 euros
Additional costs (design, marketing, delivery): 200 euros

<p><i>Discover the secrets of super quick and fresh ‘Indian restaurant’ style food...</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607591694/f9pmxcwfekot25b6jkuh.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>There’s nothing more addictive or satisfying than eating your favourite curry, but Indian food cooked at home never seems to quite reach your expectations, and there’s a good reason for this....Indian restaurants and takeaways all over the world have closely guarded secrets - that is until now!</p>
<p>Being able to replicate and in some cases improve on your favourite curry house classics is only a dream for most, but armed with the correct information its easier than you think.</p>
<p>This book aims to breakdown and simplify what initially feels like a daunting task by explaining how restaurants and takeaways can produce stunning classics in what seems like an impossibly consistent and speedy fashion.</p>
<p>Learn how to cook the familiar classics, some hidden menu gems and all the exciting starters, sides and treats which will blow you away. Not only that, your family and friends will think you ordered a takeaway...my challenge to you is to cook and serve a restaurant and takeaway standard meal for friends or family, and wait for the compliments before breaking the news, that you made it!</p>
<p><strong>Why and why now?</strong></p>
<p>Given the world situation with restaurants closing and restrictions and no end in sight, more and more people are looking to cook interesting, fresh, new foods at home.</p>
<p>Restaurant style curries are a hidden secret which many people would love to uncover and with home cooking on the rise - now is the time to to learn the secrets of your favourite curry...I for one have enjoyed the unexpected time I’ve had to experiment and explore in more depth the great recipes I've learnt and cooked for over 30 years.</p>
<p><strong>About The Author</strong></p>
<p>Brought up in Yorkshire (north of England) and living in the Midlands (the birthplace of the Balti and the location of the famous Balti triangle) for several years, as well as training as a chef and running my own restaurants around the world, I have a unique insight into the passionate world of Indian restaurant cooking (know as BIR in the UK - British Indian Restaurant).</p>
<p>Living in Leeds, Bradford and Birmingham for over 25 years, I was naturally introduced to a plethora of different Indian restaurants from a young age. Bradford and Birmingham in particular has a large Asian community and naturally a vibrant Indian Restaurant scene to accompany...I’ve been in them all; Michelin starred curry house, 5 star hotel Indian restaurants, right down to the rough and ready places where I’ve eaten with the staff after hours at 3am.</p>
<p>As a trained chef you often get addicted to finding out everything you can about certain types of food, and also trying to get as close to the original as possible....for me this happened with curry, but unsurprisingly I first gravitated to old authentic Indian cookbooks, and whilst these are great and you feel like you may be understanding the traditional cooking techniques and flavors, this simply wasn’t the type of curry I was experiencing in any of the curry houses around the world - these are something else...and it's this that now has my undivided attention, and is my current fanatical obsession...the Indian Restaurant Curry.</p>
<p><i>I want to share this amazing food with all of you right now...</i></p>
<p><strong>What sets this book apart?</strong></p>
<p>In short; simplicity, layout, nutritional information, and the recipes are crafted by a restaurant chef. All this means important factors regrading layers of flavour are as important as the look of the dish.</p>
<p>Each dish has been developed over a long period of time and tested by cooks of all levels, from novices, students, all the way upto Indian Restaurant chefs which means I have been able to write and present each recipe in such a way that all levels can cook each dish easily and quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Simplicity</strong></p>
<p>The recipe directions (method) are short and to the point (actually bullet points) and the ingredients are grouped together (i.e. dry spices, wet ingredients, etc) in such a way that as much as possible ingredients can be pre mixed or prepared so they are added to the cooking method in one step. For example, a dish which uses 12-15 dry spices in varying quantities, can be pre-measured and readied (Mise en place) in a container, ready to be added at the correct time, in one addition.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607591866/mi8mae37wx9gh1ezophz.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p><strong>Layout</strong></p>
<p>All ingredients are in bold in the short method steps which means they can be navigated quickly and easily, even during the short cooking period. Each dish will also have a quick reference for heat, and a QR code if a video is available to accompany it. Also, to make it even easier for the reader, each recipe will have the quantities for 1, 2 and 4 people (many ingredients do not factor up so it’s important to show how to cook for more people) - this is also unique to this BIR style book.</p>
<p><strong>Nutritional</strong></p>
<p>Each recipe has diet and nutritional information, so people following a Keto, Vegan or vegetarian diet can see immediately which ones are suitable or how to adapt the recipe to suit them. No other BIR style Indian cookbook has this information.</p>
<p><strong>Crafted</strong></p>
<p>Each recipe is developed from a base recipe, which generally comes from traditional cookbooks (to gain knowledge of the original origins of each dish and the methods used), and then research follows the modernisation and adaptation of the dishes in the current restaurant setting. Once the ingredients and basic tastes are established, each recipe is remodelled using a chef’s knowledge to maximise the subtleties and layers of the sauce, and then placed in the framework of the style of cooking. Next step is to simplify the dish to a point that makes cooking it, quick, easy, and enjoyable without compromising the taste and presentation of the final product. </p>
<p><strong>Book feel</strong></p>
<p>The book will have beautiful full colour pictures for each dish, as well as using photos in the cooking steps to reassure the reader they are achieving the right results. The feel will be modern and premium. The best food photographers and cookbook designers will work their magic to form a beautiful feeling book.</p>

<p align=""center""><strong>In 80 Tagen um das Reich: Eine europäische Reise</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>„Gruß aus Nimmersatt und Immersatt, wo das Deutsche Reich ein Ende hat“, hieß es um 1900 auf einer Grußpostkarte aus dem nördlichsten Ort des Deutschen Kaiserreichs. Der Flecken Nemerzatė liegt heute in Litauen. Von Nimmersatt im einstigen Memelland (oder Klein-Litauen) führt die Reise im Uhrzeigersinn entlang der Grenze und durch die grenznahen Räume des ehemaligen Deutschen Kaiserreiches. Gut 5.000 Kilometer legt der Autor per Rad zurück. In 80 Tagen umrundet er den ersten deutschen Nationalstaat von 1871. Diese europäische Deutschlandreise führt durch ehemalige Grenzlande, heute Teile Litauens, Russlands, Polens, Frankreichs, Belgiens und Dänemarks. Gestreift und überquert werden die noch aktuellen Grenzen zu Österreich, Tschechien, zur Schweiz, zu Luxemburg und zu den Niederlanden. Spurensuche auf einer Reise durch Gegenwart und Geschichte. Orte der Erinnerung, Landmarken des Historischen und persönliche Begegnungen erzählen von der längst vergangenen Zeit, der Gegenwart und den Spiegelungen des Vergangenen in der Gegenwart. Die historische road and bike „novel“ wirft in „dichter Beschreibung“ einen Blick von den Rä(n)dern her auf den einst machtvollen Staat und seine Gesellschaft. Säume und Zwischenräume werden ausgeleuchtet, in denen sich im Kleinen immer wieder das Typische des Großen zeigt. Auf der – nicht direkten, sondern gegenläufigen – Strecke von Nimmersatt nach Nidden, dem Zielort auf der Kurischen Nehrung, findet sich Bedeutendes neben Alltäglichem, oft Merkwürdiges, immer jedoch Besonderes. So entsteht das Mosaik einer - nicht nur deutschen - Grenz- und Gesamtgeschichte, die unvermittelt und beiläufig zu einem europäischen Porträt des Hier und Jetzt wird.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i>Reiseroute und Themenstopps (erste Etappe)</i></p>
<p>Die erste Etappe, die Teststrecke, führte im Oktober 2020 von Nemerzatė/Nimmersatt in Litauen nach  Ełk/Lyck im polnischen Masuren.

„Gruß aus Nimmersatt und Immersatt, wo das Deutsche Reich ein Ende hat“, hieß es um 1900 auf einer Grußpostkarte aus dem nördlichsten Ort des Deutschen Kaiserreichs. Der Flecken Nemerzatė liegt heute in Litauen. Von Nimmersatt im einstigen Memelland (oder Klein-Litauen) führt die Reise im Uhrzeigersinn entlang der Grenze und durch die grenznahen Räume des ehemaligen Deutschen Kaiserreiches. Gut 5.000 Kilometer legt der Autor per Rad zurück. In 80 Tagen umrundet er den ersten deutschen Nationalstaat von 1871. Diese europäische Deutschlandreise führt durch ehemalige Grenzlande, heute Teile Litauens, Russlands, Polens, Frankreichs, Belgiens und Dänemarks. Gestreift und überquert werden die noch aktuellen Grenzen zu Österreich, Tschechien, zur Schweiz, zu Luxemburg und zu den Niederlanden. Spurensuche auf einer Reise durch Gegenwart und Geschichte. Orte der Erinnerung, Landmarken des Historischen und persönliche Begegnungen erzählen von der längst vergangenen Zeit, der Gegenwart und den Spiegelungen des Vergangenen in der Gegenwart. Die historische road and bike „novel“ wirft in „dichter Beschreibung“ einen Blick von den Rä(n)dern her auf den einst machtvollen Staat und seine Gesellschaft. Säume und Zwischenräume werden ausgeleuchtet, in denen sich im Kleinen immer wieder das Typische des Großen zeigt. Auf der – nicht direkten, sondern gegenläufigen – Strecke von Nimmersatt nach Nidden, dem Zielort auf der Kurischen Nehrung, findet sich Bedeutendes neben Alltäglichem, oft Merkwürdiges, immer jedoch Besonderes. So entsteht das Mosaik einer - nicht nur deutschen - Grenz- und Gesamtgeschichte, die unvermittelt und beiläufig zu einem europäischen Porträt des Hier und Jetzt wird.
 
Reiseroute und Themenstopps (erste Etappe)
Die erste Etappe, die Teststrecke, führte im Oktober 2020 von Nemerzatė/Nimmersatt in Litauen nach  Ełk/Lyck im polnischen Masuren. Außerdem noch entlang der Teilstrecke Toruń/Thorn - Poznań/Posen. Die Grenze zwischen Litauen bzw. Polen und der Oblast Kaliningrad war aufgrund der Corona-Pandemie und den damit verbundenen Grenzschließungen leider nicht auf legalem Weg passierbar. Einige Orte auf jener Seite der Grenze werden daher im Frühsommer angesteuert, wenn die Tour wiederum in dieser Gegend Europas endet.
Die weiteren vier bis fünf Etappen (ca. 4.400 Kilometer) werden im Frühjahr und Frühsommer 2021 absolviert, vermutlich von Mitte/Ende März an.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi. My name is Dr. Emily Stammitti-Campbell, and I'm working toward publishing the first of a series of children's educational books, centered around underwater archaeology and a set of lovable animal friends. </p>
<p>This story and the need for this type of children's book emerged as a result of work that I did as the resident scientist at natural history museum. I realised the extent to which most people I spoke with had no idea what an underwater archaeologist did, why I would do it, or how they could get their kids involved... Otter &amp; Red was born!</p>
<p>On addition to being a niche subject that I hope to make accessible to kids everywhere, regardless of access to the shore or the money to scuba dive, our oceans are under increasing threats from overfishing and global warming to the dredging activities that threaten archaeological heritage.  If we don't start getting our young people to think critically about all aspects of our oceans and waterways, there won't be much left in them by the time I'm reading stories to my grandchildren. </p>
<p>Bringing Otter &amp; Red to life will be the culmination of a life of art, design, history, diving, volunteer work, educational programme development... so many things! But ultimately, it's about bringing a great subject to kids everywhere in a way that's entertaining, accessible and educational.  Otter &amp; Red will be the first children's book focused on underwater archaeology, and I think that for a lot of kids, it will be a real eye opener into a world they never knew existed. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>£ 2046 is the total amount I'm trying to raise to get Otter &amp; Red published in hard form (soft cover, not hard back).</p>
<p>Here is the approximate breakdown of the where the funds are going, with discrepancies for the amount of tax and fees deducted by IndieGoGo. </p>
<p>Hard copies: £250</p>
<p>Book posters: £170</p>
<p>Shipping costs: £225</p>
<p>Marketing: £400 </p>
<p>Book festival fees: £200 </p>
<p>Postcard production: £30 </p>
<p>Mailing tubes: £35 </p>
<p>Licensing costs: £150 </p>
<p>Digital production: £200 </p>
<p>Labour &amp; processing (ink, paper, etc): £200 </p>
<p>IndieGoGo Fees (approximate): £186  </p>
<p>If the entirety of funds is not raised, any funds raised will go toward fulfilling the costs associated with the rewards first, along with those basic costs required to bring the story to life (i.e. paper, ink, etc). </p>
<p>In return for you generosity, I have a host of awesome perks** (or rewards) set up so that you get something of great value.  Some of these items will be available post-publication and some won't.  Perks range from digital pre-release copies of the story, right through to being turned into a character in this story (or subsequent, if you prefer).  They're all set out to be that big thank you that I want to give each contributor, in person, but for geographical reasons, might not be able to just now. However, even on their own, they're great value for money, with discounts ranging from 25% off to 66% off! So please be assured that when you contribute, you're not only helping bring Otter &amp; Red to life, but you're also getting a product well worth your investment. </p>
<p>**If you contribute at any level before December 23rd, you'll receive a free Otter &amp; Red colouring book, delivered to you on December 24th with plenty of time for download or home printing. A great stocking stuffer for any lover of animals, history archaeology or colouring, you'll have to act fast if you want a copy, because this colouring book will be heading back up to Santa's vaults on Christmas Eve.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I won't turn this campaign pitch into a personal CV, but on a personal/professional level, I have had success with all of my past projects, whether personal pursuits or professional goals.  The educational programme I started several years ago saw a 33% drop in feelings of relative deprivation within only 2-years of operation, and over that same 2-year period, I managed to raise almost £5,000 to cover the costs of the programme and a festival to accompany it.  I understand event management, and am a great belief in good time management.  When I make a commitment, I get through it on target every time, and Otter &amp; Red will be no different.</p>
<p>I've made it through so much in my life...  My dream as a child and teenager was to be a Disney animator, but when my dad's sickness made artschool a sideshelfed dream, I didn't let not going to art school stop me from exploring creative pursuits.  I minored in art alongside my BA in history, cobbled together a degree while begging for permission to write a thesis for my masters, and then moved to Edinburgh Scotland where a second masters dovetailed into a PhD and charitable educational programme. I'm a professional scuba diver, work with kids and individuals with disabilities (to get them all involved in archaeology, history and/or the water), and absolutely love illustrating.  I've been busy and motivated, and I feel confident that I can make this book like none other on the market. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>This is my first fictional story being readied for publication.  Although I have written many academic pieces, from dissertations to policy memos and article publications in between, this fictional piece is a big step forward for me.  It not only represents a little piece of all of the things I have done and that I am, but also all of the things I have always wanted to be, so if I fail in this project, I fail massively. </p>
<p>However, Otter &amp; Red also has the potential to be my leaping off point... I already have first draft manuscripts for the creation of a series of Otter &amp; Red adventure stories, along with nearly a dozen other educational children's book hanging in the backdrop, all based in a type of history or heritage, and all hoping to inspire kids and rouse their imaginations, curiosities, and innate talents. </p>
<p>Foreseeable problems...?  A lack of interest in the story and this campaign.  Should the campaign fail to raise even the minimal funds required to publish in physical form, I'll focus on digitally publishing and target a smaller readership.  Sadly, that scenario largely means kids without access to digital devices will not have access to Otter &amp; Red. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Otter Ways You Can Help (pun intended...)</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>If you simply can't contribute, but you're still here with me, thanks.  There are plenty of ways you can help out that won't cost you a dime!  Please go ahead and share this campaign.  Maybe you can share it on Facebook or Twitter, or maybe you're part of an email group.  Perhaps you don't love social media or don't know how to share things to it... That's ok!  Give a hand-written copy of the link to your friends, take it with you to your local book club or library, or pass it on to your coworkers.  Every share is one more possibility to get Otter &amp; Red on a shelf, and so every share is deeply appreciated. </p>

I took a job as an intellectual property paralegal and forced myself to choke down my sadness and frustration in a job where I was never happy.On the day of September 11, 2001, when something I never imagined could happen DID happen, I realized, ""I'm no different from the people who went to work this morning and died. They will never again get to see the precious people they love."" I asked myself, if I had only a few moments to live, how would I answer this question: ""Was it worth it?"" The only answer that came to me was, ""NO. It's just not worth it."" Why was I torturing myself if it wasn't even worth it? I knew on that day that life was too short and too precious. I had to find another way to live... a way that would truly allow me to live.INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PARALEGAL ESCAPES HER GILDED CAGE!It was one of the most courageous things I've ever done. I left behind a ""cushy"" job, earning the most money I've ever earned, because I desperately wanted to live my life before I died. I didn't even know what I was going to do; I just knew it had to come from my heart. I wanted the energy I put into the world to come from LOVE and JOY instead of fear and misery.I wanted to be of service in the world.""I wanted to find my unique way of contributing in the world. I found it through writing and teaching.COURAGEOUS WOMAN GIVES UP GOLDEN HANDCUFFS TO FOLLOW HER HEART AND WRITE A BOOK!I have long believed that helping every human being fulfill his or her fullest potential -- and reaching our own fullest potential -- is the greatest thing we can do in life. I long to do that for myself and I long to help others do the same. That is why I teach. That is why I coach. That is why I write books. I want to share everything I have to share. I want to give everything I have to give.But in the world we live in, often it requires certain ""credentials"" like a Master's Degree. I found that to be true of myself. I taught creative writing at Colorado Free University for 10 years, but I couldn't support myself.I made tweaks to my life here and there, but it wasn't enough. Finally, I packed up everything I owned, stuffed my car to the gills with as much as it could hold, and said goodbye to Denver. I drove to Los Angeles to attend the MFA program in screenwriting at UCLA. I wanted to make my dreams of being a writer come true. I wanted to tell compelling stories like those that have impacted me, like The Hunger Games and Arrival.

<p>The morning After is a zine project dedicated to providing self-care resources to survivors of sexual violence.  This zine hopes to provide stories, art, self-care suggestions, and more to become a resource through which survivors can reflect and take steps to move forward. I noticed a real lack of useful resources available - everything I could find focussed on legal, medical and clinical action. Though these are valid and necessary steps for some people, they do not represent a complete picture of what we need. Instead, I found solace in the friends and other survivors, in listening to their stories, hearing their advice, and getting their resources. I created the Morning After Zine to extend that community, compile those stories, advice, etc and make it all more accessible for other survivors.</p> <p>The Morning After Zine is a publication that combines self-care tips with creative writing and visual art. My hope is that this combination of mediums will provide the emotional connection of a creative zine with the information and healing of a DIY self-care zine. Our zine will not be sold for profit, but donated to shelters and other organizations that work with survivors. That's why your support is so important to help us make these resources accessible for as many survivors as possible! </p> <p>I want the zine to not only be a publication, but a community. We also host a series of writing and self-care workshops and activities. These workshops aim to take the idea of radical inclusivity that inspired the zine movement and extend it to self-care and mental health by creating a space for everyone to heal together.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2><strong>What we Need</strong></h2>
<p>We are raising money to print the first issue of the Morning After Zine. The zines will then be donated to organizations that help survivors so that they can give them to survivors who might need/want them. Any extra funds raised will be used to put on self care workshops and the rest will be donated to organizations that work with survivors.</p>
<p>Here's a more detailed budget of our costs for the next six months:</p>
<ul>
<li>Printing Zines for Donation : $1200</li>
<li>Marketing: $500 </li>
<li>Workshop Materials: $300 </li>
<li>Indiegogo Perks: $500</li>
</ul>
<p> </p> <h2><strong>The Impact</strong></h2>
<p>The Morning After Zine is a platform to share your story and hear it reflected back. It is a community of people who have been where you are and can give you advice. It is a vehicle to channel and hold your trauma. It is a resource to learn about how to take care of yourself.</p>
<p>I know it has been all of this for me and for our writers. I believe it can have the same impact on survivors reading it, which is why we are trying to raise money to donate as many copies as possible so survivors can access it for free.</p>

I want to start by thanking everyone that contributed to our last campaign for The Land of Mar, you made it possible. And now I want to thank everyone looking at my new campaign to raise money for my next book, A Song of Dreams.

You so graciously ask.</p><p>Let me tell you. I started publishing this series 2 years ago, with the help of my incredible friend/amazing artist Aaron Damon Porter, and the talented layout/design stylings of Dare Porter at Real Time Design, along with the help of a patient partner, a number of friends, and countless eagle-eyed editors. It's been a fascinating road of learning how to publish, write, and market, at the same time. Our first two books, To Dream of Dancing, and The Land of Mar, both won Outstanding Children's Book of the Year from the Independent Author Network. This was a beautiful boost of confidence, coupled with the fan videos, letters, and pictures, sent to us by adults and children alike. To give back even more to our fans, I started including free digital download read-along audiobooks that I recorded at the fantastical LeStrange Fantastique Recording Studios in Atlanta, Georgia. With every book I've sold personally I've been able to give the codes for downloading, and soon every book will come directly from me since my goal is to become the wholesale distributor for all of Desdemona's Dreams.

Desdemona's Dreams is about how powerful our imaginations are, and the kind of world we can create by exercising them. Young people are some of the greatest fountains of wonder, sometimes they just need to be given the space to express it, or the encouragement. For this upcoming book I made a Create A Dream Creature Contest, and then I contacted all of the K-8th schools in New Orleans to offer it up to their students. It was free, and required only the spark of imagination, and a little bit of time. I appreciate every teacher that got back to me, and offered it to their students (I know how busy you are, my mom was a teacher). Aaron Porter and I went over all of the thoughtful, fun, and mischievous creatures that were sent to us, and we settled on a creature called Muffin, created by former Arise Academy student Archanna Byrd. Her character is now written into a pinnacle moment of the story, and is being redrawn and colored by the artist of the series, Aaron Damon Porter. Archanna added the perfect element to this book, so she's getting her picture in the back with a bio alongside Aaron's and mine. Behold the power of Muffin!</p><p><strong>Our Funding</strong> </p><p>I want to be completely transparent with all of you about the funding you're providing, because the contributions you're giving makes all of it possible. </p><p>The amount I'm trying to raise is $12,000.

I really get it since I'm an artist trying to run a small business myself. If you just don't have the extra funds to contribute, I'd appreciate you telling others about this campaign. Even if you do have the funds to contribute, please tell everyone about this campaign. You can use the Indiegogo share tools already set up on the site. Share this on Facebook. Tweet us on Twitter. Take a picture and Instagram it to all of your followers. Every little bit you do gets this series that much closer to someone else that needs a good story to help them believe in themselves. The world is what you make it!Thank you!All the unicorns,Z.W. Mohr",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

Why do babies need Dributts Diapers?</h3>
<p>Dributts was an idea that came to Michael Wahl, founder, while leading a mission trip in Haiti. He was working in a local village repairing wells and building latrines when he noticed that the babies were naked. He saw babies defecating in their homes, on their caretakers, by the food source, and by the water source. He had just built latrines for the adults and older children, but the babies could not use the latrines. Knowing the leading cause of sickness, disease, and death in third world countries is fecal matter, he knew he had to do something. </p><p>Michael returned from Haiti with the idea to take diapers back with him.  He did some research on diapers and learned that regular cloth diapers would not work because they were made of heavy materials such as fleece, cotton, and hemp. They would be too hot, hold onto bacteria, and in the Haitian heat, would cause diaper rash and chaffing which could lead to infection and cause another problem. Disposable diapers would not work because of the expense, and they create a sanitation issue since they have no place to properly dispose of the diapers. Michael knew of some Haitians washing and reusing disposable diapers until they fell apart.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459211543/vsgubyye696jgghdptkr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

wife and asked her for some ideas. After some brainstorming, they came up with
the idea to try a dri-fit moisture-wicking material that is breathable. Michael then
asked his wife, who did not know how to sew, to make some diapers. She
referred him to a friend who has a home sewing business making cloth
diapers. The friend was happy to help and developed a pattern for Dributts. She
also made the first sets of diapers. When she became too busy with her
business to continue, she taught Starla, Michael’s wife, how to sew the diapers. Then
Starla recruited some volunteers who did not know how to sew, and they learned to make the diapers. Together they made over 700 diapers! Finally, Dributts
found a manufacturer which has been a great help. <br/></span></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Simple sanitation, hygiene, and education will significantly reduce the risk of fecal- related deaths and overall help the health of the communities in developing countries around the world.<br/></span></p><p><br/></p>

<p>Nibnook is a
patent pending system for writers of every genre and experience level. The tool provides
your storyline as well as the perspective of every character in your writing project.  It offers in-depth information about
your story, characters and worlds.  Nibnook does not take the place of
your creativity, imagination or skill as a writer; it simply provides you with
deeper insight into every aspect of your story.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What is nibnook?</b><br/></p>
<p><i>
</i></p>
<p>For the
writer, nibnook is simple.  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Nibnook has
created a series of archetypal questions to help you think about your story in
meaningful ways. Your answers are plugged into the nibnook algorithm and your
story, world, and characters come to life. With this revolutionary system, you can
freely develop your unique ideas with multiple versions of your stories,
characters, and worlds. You can then start writing in nibnook’s custom writing
space and use its guided story creation process.</p>

<p><br/></p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
</div><h3><span>What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></h3><p></p>
<p>Developing nibnook has been a bootstrap endeavor. We have successfully
tested nibnook on a one-on-one basis with new writers and published authors.
Now we are seeking assistance from you to make nibnook accessible to the
public. Your donation will allow us to continue to fund the development of the
software, beta test it and launch the platform.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b><span>Stretch Goals</span></b></p>
<p><b>$30,000 or
more:</b> Development
of front and back end, beta testing and soft launch.</p>
<p><b>$50,000 or
more:</b> Nibnook
expansion for character development and world building.</p>
<p><b>$70,000 or
more:</b> Development
of additional features that enhance and build-out the platform.</p><p></p><ul><li>The creation of real-time triggering events. These moments add
layers and depth to each section or chapter. The nibnook software already
provides incredible detail about your characters, stories and worlds. But just
like our daily lives, the lives of your characters change and flow based on their
daily interactions. Reaching this goal will allow us to create the additional
software needed for writers to access to this invaluable information.</li></ul><div><br/></div><ul><li>The development of the Quarterly Section. This is where you can
acquire minute-by-minute information about your stories. In this section, you can
input a random question about your story, and nibnook will comb through your
customized algorithm to find the answer.</li></ul><div><br/></div><ul><li>Creation of a character relationship analysis. This aspect of
nibnook will enable you to see how your characters trigger each other
throughout each section of your story.</li></ul><br/><h3>The Impact</h3><p></p>
<p>Nibnook has
done what was once thought impossible. This platform generates your story
outline, develops your characters and builds your worlds by you answering just
a few short questions.</p>
<p>Nibnook has
created a streamlined process that has drastically cut down on the time you need
to develop a character. With nibnook, what would normally take you weeks to
develop can be generated in a few minutes.</p>
<p>The software
created by nibnook is the first of its kind and making it available to the
public will give those with the passion and desire to write the tools and space
needed to realize their goals and dreams.</p>
<p> </p><br/><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><p>There are a few challenges that we face in the development of the software:</p><p>1.  The software is a complex system on the back end, but it must remain simple and intuitive to the user.</p><p>Although the algorithm is a complex, we have paid careful attention to ensure the development of an intuitive and simple user interface. The creator and developers are writers, so we understand the basic needs of a writer. The goal is to ease the amount of work the user has to do before they acquire their storybooks and story map.</p><p><br/></p><p>2.  Nibnook’s back end contains an enormous amount of data that must be carefully expanded and modified on a continuous basis as we learn from our users and their behaviors.</p><p>We are creating a platform that provides an incredible amount data and information to the user. Our goal is to tailor the data to match the needs of our users in a constructive way. Because of the potential for diverse perspectives, the hard work of modifying the data will come from writers giving us information about their needs as they navigate through the nibnook platform.</p><p><br/></p><p>3.  The tool is a new concept. Nibnook’s crown jewel is its intuitive algorithm that will change the way the public interfaces with an online platform. This provides the challenge of a built-in learning curve for the user.</p><p>We are overcoming these challenges in the following ways.:</p><ul>
<li><p>Creating a user experience that is organic in its process.</p></li>

</div></div>","Nibnook is a
patent pending system for writers of every genre and experience level. The tool provides
your storyline as well as the perspective of every character in your writing project.  It offers in-depth information about
your story, characters and worlds.  Nibnook does not take the place of
your creativity, imagination or skill as a writer; it simply provides you with
deeper insight into every aspect of your story.

What is nibnook?


For the
writer, nibnook is simple.  


Nibnook has
created a series of archetypal questions to help you think about your story in
meaningful ways. Your answers are plugged into the nibnook algorithm and your
story, world, and characters come to life. With this revolutionary system, you can
freely develop your unique ideas with multiple versions of your stories,
characters, and worlds. You can then start writing in nibnook’s custom writing
space and use its guided story creation process.








                                 
How Does it Work?





   
What We Need & What You Get
Developing nibnook has been a bootstrap endeavor. We have successfully
tested nibnook on a one-on-one basis with new writers and published authors.
Now we are seeking assistance from you to make nibnook accessible to the
public. Your donation will allow us to continue to fund the development of the
software, beta test it and launch the platform.

Stretch Goals
$30,000 or
more: Development
of front and back end, beta testing and soft launch.
$50,000 or
more: Nibnook
expansion for character development and world building.
$70,000 or
more: Development
of additional features that enhance and build-out the platform.The creation of real-time triggering events. These moments add
layers and depth to each section or chapter. The nibnook software already
provides incredible detail about your characters, stories and worlds. But just
like our daily lives, the lives of your characters change and flow based on their
daily interactions. Reaching this goal will allow us to create the additional
software needed for writers to access to this invaluable information.The development of the Quarterly Section. This is where you can
acquire minute-by-minute information about your stories. In this section, you can
input a random question about your story, and nibnook will comb through your
customized algorithm to find the answer.Creation of a character relationship analysis. This aspect of
nibnook will enable you to see how your characters trigger each other
throughout each section of your story.The Impact
Nibnook has
done what was once thought impossible. This platform generates your story
outline, develops your characters and builds your worlds by you answering just
a few short questions.
Nibnook has
created a streamlined process that has drastically cut down on the time you need
to develop a character. With nibnook, what would normally take you weeks to
develop can be generated in a few minutes.
The software
created by nibnook is the first of its kind and making it available to the
public will give those with the passion and desire to write the tools and space
needed to realize their goals and dreams.
 Risks & ChallengesThere are a few challenges that we face in the development of the software:1.  The software is a complex system on the back end, but it must remain simple and intuitive to the user.Although the algorithm is a complex, we have paid careful attention to ensure the development of an intuitive and simple user interface. The creator and developers are writers, so we understand the basic needs of a writer. The goal is to ease the amount of work the user has to do before they acquire their storybooks and story map.2.  Nibnook’s back end contains an enormous amount of data that must be carefully expanded and modified on a continuous basis as we learn from our users and their behaviors.We are creating a platform that provides an incredible amount data and information to the user. Our goal is to tailor the data to match the needs of our users in a constructive way. Because of the potential for diverse perspectives, the hard work of modifying the data will come from writers giving us information about their needs as they navigate through the nibnook platform.3.  The tool is a new concept. Nibnook’s crown jewel is its intuitive algorithm that will change the way the public interfaces with an online platform. This provides the challenge of a built-in learning curve for the user.We are overcoming these challenges in the following ways.:
Creating a user experience that is organic in its process.
Marketing the platform in a way that details the ease in usability.
Providing short tutorials that help users navigate the platform.

<p>This is the story of how you create love. </p>
<p>You may believe love is something that just happens. You think romantic love is like a four-leaf clover - something some people get lucky and find. You may believe some people were meant to have love and others are not or that some people are ""good"" at love while others are ""bad"" at it.</p>
<p>Perhaps you think certain conditions need to exist before you can have love. You must be good-looking enough, fun enough, smart enough, rich enough, or healed enough to be lovable.</p>
<p>I was exceptionally bad at finding love. If I wasn't being completely romantically ignored in a bar or at a party, I was probably dating someone I wasn't that into, or who only wanted to sleep with me until they found someone better. I dated men who wouldn't contact me on the weekends. My “first love” play wrestled with my best friend in front of me (we were not children). I was taken on a date to a swingers club for Gang Bang Night as a <i>very</i> unsolicited surprise. I was non-consensually taken to dinner and bowling by my hotel receptionist after I asked him where I could find food nearby (yes, I will reveal all these stories in the book). :)</p>
<p>After years of heartbreak and suffering, I was fairly resigned to being unlovable and incapable of falling in <i>real,</i> fulfilling love. But, I decided I could fix myself. I read books by Marriage and Family Therapists like Esther Perel and John Gottman. I watched every TedTalk with the words “love” or “heartbreak” in the title. I researched tantra and connection techniques. I spent hours consuming articles and YouTube videos by relationship therapists and coaches. I even took a dive into reality TV dating shows. </p>
<p>And I found answers about why I struggled in love, but they didn’t require that I <i>fix</i> or <i>change</i> <i>myself</i>. </p>
<p>(I was, in fact, a bit put off by Robert Greene's <i>The Art of Seduction, </i>because I read it as suggesting you need to embody a seductive caricature in order to be desirable and effective at creating love.) I believe you can and do create the best love when you are authentically yourself.</p>
<p>From what I learned, I turned my own love life around 180 degrees. Now several years and plenty of dating success later, I formed a simple system that you can also use to make dating anyone (including current committed partners) fun, empowering, and gratifying:</p>
<h3>1. Create Attraction</h3>
<h3>2. Create Sexual Tension</h3>
<h3>3. Create Emotional Connection</h3>
<h3><i>Each of these steps have energetic, psychological, biological, and hormonal components that can be learned and practiced, by anyone, to create love.</i></h3>
<p><i>Feminine Seduction</i> is the name of my process for creating love, which I now teach to others in a course of the same name (more info below). </p>
<p>Feminine in this case is an archetypal energy, rather than a way of being <i>female</i>. It is part of all people, though it usually shows up more strongly in estrogen-predominant people. I like talking in energetic terms because it allows for more flexibility and nuance of gender, sex, and sexuality, whereas the science is still quite new, and studies were done almost exclusively on straight male-female couples. I speak to the feminine energy side because it is the space I personally occupy!</p>
<p>I must acknowledge that I wrote with the filter of being a white, cisgender, heterosexual woman, and these facts informed my experience and parts of how I express my system. I do, however, wholeheartedly believe that everyone has the power to create the love of their dreams using the basics of what I teach.</p>
<p>If the words <i>feminine</i> and <i>seduction</i> make you uncomfortable, you are likely afraid of or uncomfortable with your feminine power and/or your seductive power (how you get what you want and need in life). Consider that you are already seductive, but you may not have examined HOW you use this power.</p>
<p><i>No matter who you are and what your story has been so far, you can create love.</i></p>
<p>I hope you will read my book and allow it to enrich your life, or that your curiosity about my atrocious dates will get the best of you ;)</p>
<p>The first draft of this book is written, but I'd love to have your support in making it an incredible published reality!</p>
<h2>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h2>

<h3>Who are we, really?</h3>
<p>That’s the question I explore in <strong><i>Amazing Mostly True Adventures of Horace Martin</i></strong>. It’s a collection of short stories that detail two things at once: a life being shaped, and a boy exerting the only will he knows—to shape a life all his own. </p>
<p>The response to my first self-published book (<i>Lesson, Boys' Homes/Prisons/Lunatic Asylums</i>) last year was overwhelming. The encouragement gave me the drive to jump on this book. </p>
<p>The stories begin in 1953 with my birth in Ireland and change their setting a few years later, with my family’s move to England. Throughout the book, seemingly random personal experiences in both countries create a portrait of my past. The stories, and the memories they recall, ebb and flow, as memories do. Recollections of holiday gatherings, family loyalty and happy times with caring grownups are offset by the harsh realities of prejudice, reform schools, drugs and abuse at the hands of others.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s a sampling:</strong></p>
<p>In “The Road to Notorious,” things aren’t looking so good for me in Britain’s Swinging Sixties. I’ve already forged a life of crime at the age of thirteen. From shoplifting notions to stealing cars, taking drugs, and carving my own path from courtrooms to correctional houses, I’m a seemingly hopeless delinquent who can only disappoint my parents and indulge my worst judgment.</p>
<p>Yet the sum of this book’s stories is to prove that no one person is any one thing. Saints and sinners reside in all of us, something our most honest selves recognize as true. Readers will find moments of true beauty shining in some of the book’s darkest passages. And while these adventures share one leg of my journey (from Ireland to England; for the next book, I plan to share my experience moving from England to America), their existence offers hope.<br/><br/><strong>My words represent my survival. Their life on the page shares the triumph of accountability over self-will. I look forward to sharing them with you.</strong></p>

<p>Thank you everyone for helping me reach my goal! Anything more than this just means I can print more books, support local printers that are a bit more expensive than the big companies, and make sure the quality is even better! </p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>This is the story of a little girl with big dreams. With this book I hope to inspire little girls to be whatever they want to be. You will face challenges, get scared, and people will hold you back, but if you set your mind to it you can do anything. </p>
<p>I travelled for a few years and spent a lot of time sleeping under the stars looking up at the moon. The story was always going through my head while I laid in my sleeping bag at night and I finally decided it was time to write it down. I forgot about it and it sat written for a long time while I continued to travel until I settled down in Australia where I met Anna, from Germany, who offered to do the illustrations. The book finally came to life and I hope that it can inspire children, and adults, to follow their dreams no matter how big or small they are. </p>
<p>With your contribution I hope to not only inspire children who read this book, but to give children access to books who wouldn't otherwise have that opportunity. With each purchase buyers will have the option to donate a book to a child who can't afford one or donate a percentage to a charity that helps children gain access to books.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need $1500 for printing costs. This will allow me to print 200 books in the US and 200 in Australia so I am able to get started and get the book out there. The book is already complete and ready to go so all I need now is to get it printed so kids can read it!</p>
<p>Even if I do not reach my entire goal, any amount of funding helps and I can print a smaller amount of books to start. </p>

Anything more than this just means I can print more books, support local printers that are a bit more expensive than the big companies, and make sure the quality is even better! 
Short Summary
This is the story of a little girl with big dreams. With this book I hope to inspire little girls to be whatever they want to be. You will face challenges, get scared, and people will hold you back, but if you set your mind to it you can do anything. 
I travelled for a few years and spent a lot of time sleeping under the stars looking up at the moon. The story was always going through my head while I laid in my sleeping bag at night and I finally decided it was time to write it down. I forgot about it and it sat written for a long time while I continued to travel until I settled down in Australia where I met Anna, from Germany, who offered to do the illustrations. The book finally came to life and I hope that it can inspire children, and adults, to follow their dreams no matter how big or small they are. 
With your contribution I hope to not only inspire children who read this book, but to give children access to books who wouldn't otherwise have that opportunity. With each purchase buyers will have the option to donate a book to a child who can't afford one or donate a percentage to a charity that helps children gain access to books.
 

What We Need & What You Get
I need $1500 for printing costs. This will allow me to print 200 books in the US and 200 in Australia so I am able to get started and get the book out there. The book is already complete and ready to go so all I need now is to get it printed so kids can read it!
Even if I do not reach my entire goal, any amount of funding helps and I can print a smaller amount of books to start. 


The Impact
I am passionate about this project because I am a female who has often been told that I can't do something because I am too small or it's too dangerous or difficult for a girl. I travelled by myself, built houses, fixed cars, had jobs where I am one of only a couple females, and so many more things that are ""just for boys"" and I have had many amazing female teachers along the way. I want little girls to know that if there is anything they want to do, they can.

<p>Good wine is about a sense of place. Where a wine's grapes are grown - be it Napa, Chianti, Bordeaux, Mendoza - is inseparable from how it tastes. That's why wine maps are important to us.</p>
<p>Wine Maps of the World - The Essential Collection makes it easy to pinpoint a wine’s location with ease, accuracy, and style. It’s the result of over ten years of making wine maps at De Long. Put it in your tasting room, wine cellar, or any place you drink wine, and you’ll find yourself referring to it again and again.  Its unique format makes it more than just a reference but an enjoyable way to learn and share about a wine’s origins.</p>

<p>Argentina and Chile are extremely challenging to map. Their wine laws define most wine regions only by political boundaries. Showing the actual vineyard areas in these political boundaries is necessary. Otherwise, it’s just a political map, as well as a misleading wine map, where Tucumán, which has 0.05% of Argentina’s total vineyard area, is shown the same as Mendoza, which has 70.59%. To plot the vineyard areas takes an enormous amount of time examining satellite imagery. We were also much helped by Brian Ravitsky, Sebastian Zuccardi, Derek Mossman Knapp, Rafael Tirado, Leonardo Erazo, José Lovaglio and David Marcel with their local knowledge.</p>

<p>Wine Australia does a fantastic job of getting clear information about their regions out in the world, which made our work a bit easier here.

<p>Wines of South Africa is another organization that does a great job of disseminating information about their regions.

That’s why we’re putting this invaluable reference in a handy bookshelf format. The full set has 12 maps of the world’s main wine-producing countries and regions.

The maps are also available individually – each comes in a box with an index and handy map tack stickers for plotting regions that you’ve tasted or visited.
Many of our maps are not of a single country or state. It seems strange to keep Portugal blanked out on a map of Spain, or to slice off Chile from a map of Argentina. Wine doesn’t stop at the border! All of our maps show adjacent countries’ wine regions whenever possible.

Includes: all wine regions in Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Brazil; detail map of Mendoza.
 

Wine Australia does a fantastic job of getting clear information about their regions out in the world, which made our work a bit easier here. The challenge here was to present all of the overlapping regions on one map legibly. We also took the liberty of showing the unofficial wine sub-regions of Tasmania, which have still not been officially recognized (as is often the case with up and coming regions).
Includes: all Geographic Indications (GIs) including all States/Zones, Regions and Subregions; detail map of regions around Adelaide (ie Barossa Valley, Clare Valley, McLaren Vale, etc).
 

Mapping New Zealand wine regions presented the same challenges as Chile and Argentina: their wine regions are also defined in broad strokes using political boundaries. So again, a great deal of time was spent plotting vineyard areas and potential vineyard areas from satellite imagery.
Includes: all GIs and sub GIs; detail maps of Central Otago, Marlborough, Wairarapa, Hawke's Bay and Gisborne; statistics regarding acreage and major grape varieties of each region.
 

Wines of South Africa is another organization that does a great job of disseminating information about their regions. The only problem is that they’ve made three significant overhauls of their wine laws in the past decade. Like Australia, the challenge here was to present all of the overlapping regions on one map clearly.
Includes: all WO (Wine of Origin) areas: Geographical Units, Regions, Districts, and Wards; generalized wine map of Africa; detail map of Stellenbosch; Northern and Free State detail.
 
Prototypes
Our initial prototypes had a cloth covering, but we found a textured paper covering that is both better looking and more durable.

Timeline
The maps are all done with a few exceptions:  maps of the IGP (Vin de Pays) regions of France and the IGP regions of Spain are currently underway.
November 2019 to February 2020: Finalize all graphics, additional maps and updates.
February 2020 to April 2020: Proofing, printing and delivery to our warehouse.
Mid April 2020: All copies sent out to backers.
Dimensions


Each map is 24 x 36 inches (61 cm x 91.5 cm) unfolded.
Individual map cases are 6.25 x 9.25 x 0.5 inches (15.9 cm x 22.9 cm x 1.0 cm).
The boxed set is 10 x 5 x 6.5 inches (25.4 x 12.7 x 16.5 cm).
