<p>The ikiPele radiates heat which can be used to roast perfect marshmallows. After about 45 minutes of burning, the pellets will glow for another 45 minutes, this is the perfect time to start roasting.</p>

<p>During combustion the solid pellets are converted into heat and wood gas. In a normal fire this wood gas is not used, but not with the IkiPele.

OUTDOOR LIVING

You can use the ikiPele in your garden or balcony, but you can also take it with you on a short trip or vacation.
SIMPLE COOKING

The ikiPele can also be used for preparing food or just keeping your food hot. With the included cross at the top you can place a pan or pot on your ikiPele.
ROASTING

The ikiPele radiates heat which can be used to roast perfect marshmallows. After about 45 minutes of burning, the pellets will glow for another 45 minutes, this is the perfect time to start roasting.


IGNITE

To start the ikiPele, just light the starter and place the wind cover. As the firestarter starts to burn it will ignite the wood pellets.

During the IndieGoGo campaign we still offer the ikiPele against the reduced crowdfunding price.

Thank you so much!</p></div>","Nautalytics was born out of the desire of two racing sailors looking for a reliable and simple-to-use digital magnetic compass.  Founders, Quinn Schwenker and Justin Coplan, are accomplished sailors which means their ability to craft and supply a solution that works for sailors, our customers, and friends, is as good as it gets.
Quinn is the trimmer for the J-24, Nautalytics, 2018 North American Champion, 2018 - 2017 Kiel Week Champion, 2013 US National Champion, and has nine top ten finishes at  J-24 World Championships.
Justin is a  silver medalist at the 2015 Pan American Games and  at the 2013 Lightning World Championships.  He is also the tactician for  the J-24, Nautalytics, 2018 North American Champion, 2018  Kiel Week Champion, and has many top ten finishes at  J-24 World Championships.
 J-24 team Nautalytics:  Quinn, Justin, Marianne, Mike and Max at 2018 Kiel WeekWe are racing sailors that wanted a dependable digital magnetic compass with big numbers that are easy to see, for a good price, and that is class legal.We couldn't find one on the market that met our needs, so we made one.(photos taken through polarized lenses)We have all experienced it: a beautiful sailing day in the morning, and a storm front comes through the racecourse in the afternoon. We wanted a compass that we could see in all conditions with your polarized sunglasses on or off. We developed our compass with an easy to see LCD display with large 1.4” high numbers that are visible in ALL weather conditions. Our compass has three primary features:
Filters to allow use of polarized sunglasses with minimal black out zones
A faceplate that doesn't create rainbows with polarized sunglasses
Anti-glare coating
Large numbers
 Count down timer for starts. Hit the GUN button to start the countdown, hit it again to synchronize down to the next whole minute. Set the timer between one- and nine-minutes. After the timer has counted down the compass is displayed.Back light for night sailing.Brackets for a mast or deck. Every compass gets your choice of an anodized aluminum bracket with a means of attachment. Universal mast attachment includes a 2” wide hook and loop strap and a mast slug that fits inside your mast bolt rope track. Deck bracket includes 3M Dual Lock™. 
Nautalytics SIMPLE Compass
Universal mast bracket or deck bracket and everything you need to attach it to your boat
Soft case
Back plate
Compass with Deck BracketCompass with Mast BracketSee wind shifts: While racing sailboats, we use the compass to detect headers and lifts when sailing upwind. The ability to see the wind shift allows the crew to take advantage of the change in wind direction and sail less distance. Using a compass for racing is a fundamental skill for competitive sailing.Navigation: Our compass can be used for navigation by anyone. Because it is a magnetic compass, it is affected by ferrous metals and is not ideal for all locations.

I'm a photographer living in Greensboro, NC. My wife's name is Lindsey. She is an incredible event coordinator and she also stays at home to raise our sweet daughter, Sybil. We are passionate about people, justice, and love...and we love seeing all three come together in unexpected places.We are headed to Hyderabad, India this January in order to shoot and produce a book of portraits. The book will visually tell the heartbreaking stories of several young children, teenagers and adults who have been rejected and orphaned by their families at a young age. Our hopes are, that through this project, we will be able to meet these people and share their unheard stories, revealing a life of heartbreak, trial, and a hope within them that overcomes it all. We seek to show God's love to them and also help further fund the efforts of the orphanage where they live.Through the production of this book, we hope to also create an awareness of the reality of orphanhood worldwide, show the beauty of the Indian culture, and display the glory of what God is doing in the hearts of His children. Which brings me to my next point:We need your help! The only way we can accomplish this project is with you by our side.View more photos from our trip in 2007 What We Need and How You Benefit- We need money for the plane tickets to Hyderabad. We also need to purchase a mobile light kit for shooting the portraits. Lastly, the remainder of the money we bring in will go to the cost of producing/printing the books for YOU :)- We're giving away awesome prizes if you can help get us there!

<p><strong>Who We Are</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/medias/890057/pictures/full/20130624113539-Stellaris_Logo.jpg?1372124144"" src="""" style=""float: right;"" title=""Logo""/>Stellaris is a small solar energy company located in Massachusetts. At Stellaris, we have a very different approach to making solar modules, which greatly reduces the cost of solar energy. Our module is made entirely of plastic, with small lenses that focus light onto solar cells. Not only is the plastic cheaper than conventional construction, but also the lenses reduce the amount of solar cells needed almost threefold.With this technology, Stellaris hopes to make solar energy more affordable for everyone. </p>
<p><strong>Our Mission</strong></p>
<p>Stellaris’s overall goal is to make cheap and efficient solar modules to power your homes and offices. However, as a tiny startup, we just can't jump into the mainstream and compete with billion dollar solar module manufacturers. So we decided to start small, making consumer electronic products with our technology with a plan to evolve into other products with larger markets. </p>

<p><strong>The ClearCharge</strong></p>

It can be used to charge all low voltage devices, such as cell phones, e-readers, and MP3 players. The ClearCharge allows for convenient charging in your home, or while outside. The ClearCharge is great for outdoor trips where an outlet might not be available, such as trips to the beach, camping, or all day sporting events. In addition to conveientce, the ClearCharge is doing its part to help the enviornment by using only solar power.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need and Why You Should Contribute</strong></p>
<p>Right now, we are making our solar chargers in our lab.  Each charger is currently made by hand. This process is great for learning about our devices and reducing assembly time and cost, which will be important when we have prefected the product enough to move into automated assembly. </p>
<p>This is where you come in. A contribution from you will allow for us to continue making improvements to ClearCharge. With your contribution, you will receive your very own ClearCharge. Not only will the ClearCharge be convenient for charging away from outlets, but by using it, you will be doing your enviornmental duty by using less fossil fuel power. </p>
<p>Even if our goal is not reached completely, any contribution you make can help us continue to improve ClearCharge and Stellaris's technology. </p>

After ClearCharge, Stellaris already has two products on the drawing board: Photovoltaic tiles for windows and rooftop solar modules. Though the most revolutionary concept of Stellaris’s technology is the ability to use only 1/3 of the amount of photovoltaic material, Stellaris products are also made of inexpensive plastic. This not only reduces the cost, but also reduces the cost of roof installation, as the product is light and can be more easily installed.</p>
<p><strong>Impact</strong></p>
<p>Stellaris is proud of the impact that our technology will have on both the solar and alternative energy markets. Because our products are so inexpensive, solar energy will now be an option to families and companies who could not initially afford it. Additionally, because our products can be mounted on windows, solar will also available to consumers who previously could not purchase solar because a roof was not an option. </p>

<p><em>Does the ClearCharge work inside?</em></p>
<p>Yes, the ClearCharge works inside, when hung on a window. However, like all solar products,  it works better outside, as any material such as window glass decreases the efficiency of the module.</p>
<p><em>Does the ClearCharge work when there is no sun?</em></p>
<p>Yes. The ClearCharge comes equipped with 3 rechargeable batteries, so even if the sky becomes overcast, your electronics can continue to be charged with no delay. When the sun comes out again, it returns the batteries back to full charge.</p>

<p>You can do this by</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>claiming one or more perks</strong> of your choice! They already include international shipping, if needed. It costs nothing extra. The perks will be made and shipped as soon as the device is functional or if a possibility arises to make the objects with another device. It is difficult to pin the date but it should be possible until Christmas 2012 - I keep you updated.</li>
<li>
<strong>sharing this campaign</strong> and spreading the word! Just emailing this video to 10 friends, reposting on your Facebook page, or Tweeting about it could make a significant difference.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Funding Use</h3>
<p>The funding will be used to develop and construct a stable device for development and to make objects, of course!</p>
<h4>If there is more</h4>
<p>Additional funding will be used to make the foam cutter accessible by anyone. A website will be created to let everyone design and order objects. If there is even more funding it will be used for hardware development, as well as tests and planning for a larger cutter because there are no size restrictions with polystyrene foam.</p>

The Future of 3D Printing!


Imagine an interactive kiosk device where you just go to and get the object of your choice - similar to a StarTrek Replicator!


Print your objects from smart phone, tablet, USB key or network
OR draw&design models ad-hoc and get the physical object immediately!

The future of 3D printing will be a large multi-function unit in your area. Around the corner, in a shopping mall for example - always ready and easy to use.

In Person
 My name is Ingo. I'm a computer engineer and software developer, living in Jena, Thuringia, Germany. In 2006, during my study at the TU Berlin we built a 3D foam cutter in a student project StyroFoamRobot. We also developed an interactive desktop program to easily design objects by their rotationally shape. There is also a project report available which is in German.
 
  

 
Help to fund the contruction of a new 3D Foam Cutter!
Large, precise, fast - simply better!
The Perks
For 10€you get a lovely Thank-You card by mail! Pictures of it follow at this place soon! Stay tuned, Register at indiegogo and add the project as favorite to get updates!
 

 

For 25€you get the Berlin TV Tower in raw material or in a color of your choice (for 35€)! It's approximately 20cm tall. A Thank-You card by mail is included, of course!
 

 

For 50€you get the Puppy in raw material or in a color of your choice (for 75€)! It's approximately 20cm in size. A Thank-You card by mail is included, of course!
 
Available colors
white black yellow orange red violet purple light blue blue
If you like to get another color or perk object, from the videos for example, just let me know! Nearly everything is possible!
To thank you for the long-term all supporters get benefits for future offers by the project!

Help to Fund the Required Materials!
You can do this by


claiming one or more perks of your choice! They already include international shipping, if needed. It costs nothing extra. The perks will be made and shipped as soon as the device is functional or if a possibility arises to make the objects with another device. It is difficult to pin the date but it should be possible until Christmas 2012 - I keep you updated.

sharing this campaign and spreading the word! Just emailing this video to 10 friends, reposting on your Facebook page, or Tweeting about it could make a significant difference.

Funding Use
The funding will be used to develop and construct a stable device for development and to make objects, of course!
If there is more
Additional funding will be used to make the foam cutter accessible by anyone. A website will be created to let everyone design and order objects. If there is even more funding it will be used for hardware development, as well as tests and planning for a larger cutter because there are no size restrictions with polystyrene foam.
Found a favorite perk?
Did you tell your friends about the project?
Thank you very much for your attention and best regards!

Die Zukunft des 3D-Drucks!

Stell dir ein interaktives Kioskgerät vor, zu dem du einfach gehst und dir ein Objekt deiner Wahl erstellen lässt - wie bei einem StarTrek-Replikator!


Drucke deine Objekte von Smartphone, Tablet, USB-Stick oder WiFi
ODER entwerfe&zeichne sie direkt am Gerät und erhalte sie sofort!

Die Zukunft des 3D-Druck wird ein größeres Multi-Funktionsgerät in deiner Nähe sein. Um die Ecke, zum Beispiel in einem Einkaufszentrum - immer bereit und einfach zu nutzen.

<p><strong>THE SUMMARY</strong></p>
<p>In the early days of my career I trained as a paramedic and disaster response technician. This experience convinced me that my vocational path was destined to help prepare people for life in big cities.</p>
<p>I started my business over a decade ago driven by a desire to help people foster an authentic sense of belonging and deeper social connection to the urban environment. Urban Expeditions brings to market customizable 4-hour city tours and experiential games that make learning about cultural diversity fun and engaging.</p>
<p>We currently live in an age where <strong><a href=""http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/publications/2014-revision-world-urbanization-prospects.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">50% of the planet's human population </a></strong>live in cities. At the same time, the <strong><a href=""https://www.wttc.org/research/economic-research/economic-impact-analysis/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">travel and tourism</a></strong> industry represent almost 10% of the global GDP. Now more than ever, I feel there’s a need for our brand of urban travel service that helps provide thoughtful cultural immersion.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE ASK AND THE PLAN</strong></p>
<p>I'm trying to raise at least $125,000 to achieve 3 key business goals over the next 12 months. Primarily, I aim to expand our experience architecture into 5 new North American cities including San Francisco, Miami,  Seattle, Phoenix and Vancouver. I'll also optimize our local marketing efforts and hire up to seven part-time staff. An outlying 2018 goal is to assemble an influential panel of 5 travel industry advisors who can steer Urban Expeditions toward global sustainability within the next 36 months.</p>
<p>A capital injection of $125,000 will help Urban Expeditions become more competitive in the global tourism marketplace. Our team will use a total of $25,000 to leverage marketing efforts that put a premium on acquiring local cultural knowledge and experience.  These activities include targeted social media advertising and public relations activities for not-for-profits, universities and corporate groups. </p>
<p>Up to $75,000 will be used to hire and train new staff. These human resources will be cultivated from university hospitality and tourism programs. This allows us to help move the concept of formal education in tourism beyond hotel and restaurant management and assist students in building relevant professional networks in their local community.</p>
<p>The balance of the crowdfunding, or $25,000, will be used for product and service development. This includes traveling to the five new North American cities mentioned above, conferencing, networking and producing the framework for up to 20 new city tours and experiential games.</p>Your investment in this project will help people learn about new cities and urban cultures quickly, safely and from a first person perspective. You should consider your financial contribution as paying-it-forward for your next urban adventure.

<p><strong>HOW WE BENEFIT THE COMMUNITY </strong></p>
<p>All to often, the unintended circumstance of living in the city is the emotional stress due to social pressures and the cost of living. This stress can have an adverse impact on a person's mental health.</p>
<p>Urban Expeditions benefits the community by creating practical opportunities for youth, adults and seniors that combine health and wellness with dynamic learning. Our city tour and game service encourages people of all ages to get outside, stay physically fit and have fun experiencing the advantages of cultural diversity.</p>
<p>We're not tour guides. We're <strong><a href=""https://vimeo.com/115088540"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">brokers</a></strong> of practical local information. We separate this information into 4 categories and create a series of 4-hour grassroots experiences. Each 4-hour experience is designed to  reduce social barriers and transform our customers into locals as quickly as possible. </p>
<p>Over the years, we've designed exciting activities that showcase local heritage, promote student success and enhance the outreach efforts of charitable organizations. In 2017, our city tours and experiential games drove almost 4000 people through a network of 100 local businesses.</p>

<p><strong>THE CURRENT MARKETPLACE </strong></p>
<p>Urban Expeditions uses technology to share information about our services, conduct point-of-sale transactions and monitor the quality of our experiences. But the two most exciting ways in which we use technology is game play and city tour customization. </p>
<p>Our experiential game <strong><a href=""http://www.unlockthecity.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Unlockthecity</a></strong> uses a digital game-board and social media to help players explore the city and score points for a chance to win great prizes. We also use a <strong><a href=""http://urbanexpeditions.com/passports/lonelyplanet/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">digital passport</a></strong> to help our city tour guests customize their own urban adventures from the comfort of home or office.

<p> </p>
<p><strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</strong></p>
<p>Our greatest business challenge is time. It takes approximately 250 hours to produce each experiential game and 400 hours to cast each city tour.

<p>Our chemistry of success is found in the way we blend technology with practical opportunities  to show our customers what takes place beyond a city's main attractions. Companies like Airbnb present the greatest challenge to our business model because of how they use their proprietary technology to retail accommodations, experiences and now restaurant bookings.

<p>Our city tours and experiential games are not expensive bucket-list activities that our customers actively save their money for over a period of time. We offer an affordable service that enhances the local urban lifestyle.</p>

<p><strong>HOW YOU CAN HELP</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to consider this crowd-funding proposal. You can continue to help this initiative by spreading the word on your social media networks, commenting on what you think we could do better and, of course - investing some money.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, an incredible amount of effort has gone into producing our socially innovative prototypes and now it's time to conduct a fitting launch. Our experiential formula removes cultural barriers, promotes relevant urban activities and empowers people from all walks of life to get outside, stay active and engage the city.</p>
<p>The notable physician and entrepreneur Dr. John Evans was once quoted as saying that 'a brilliant idea in isolation is not enough to create a real breakthough.' I need your support. I hope that this campaign will start a conversation related to how we reflect on our history and value the uniqueness of each other.</p>
<p>If we inherit the earth from our parents and borrow it from the children, then the limited time that we spend in between should be used to join the two in a positive cultural narrative. Our city tour and game experiences do just that. Be part of the movement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU</strong></p>
<p>Life in the big city can be relentless and uncompromising. This is why Urban Expeditions exists: to help make the human experience a bit easier. Like the first explorers who created maps and charts so that others may follow. Because, one day you may feel just as intimidated by the thriving metropolis as your grand parents who've watched the city expand around them.</p>

Thanks for taking the time to consider this crowd-funding proposal. You can continue to help this initiative by spreading the word on your social media networks, commenting on what you think we could do better and, of course - investing some money.
Over the last few years, an incredible amount of effort has gone into producing our socially innovative prototypes and now it's time to conduct a fitting launch. Our experiential formula removes cultural barriers, promotes relevant urban activities and empowers people from all walks of life to get outside, stay active and engage the city.
The notable physician and entrepreneur Dr. John Evans was once quoted as saying that 'a brilliant idea in isolation is not enough to create a real breakthough.' I need your support. I hope that this campaign will start a conversation related to how we reflect on our history and value the uniqueness of each other.
If we inherit the earth from our parents and borrow it from the children, then the limited time that we spend in between should be used to join the two in a positive cultural narrative. Our city tour and game experiences do just that. Be part of the movement.
 
WHAT'S IN IT FOR YOU
Life in the big city can be relentless and uncompromising. This is why Urban Expeditions exists: to help make the human experience a bit easier. Like the first explorers who created maps and charts so that others may follow. Because, one day you may feel just as intimidated by the thriving metropolis as your grand parents who've watched the city expand around them.",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div><div>
<p><b>What is that tripod device that drone racers use?</b></p>
<p>That's called a ground station, it's used for getting better reception in what are called 'multi-pathing' environments where you have a lot of racers on similar channels and interference affecting video reception.  They aren't required for most flyers who try to stay mobile, the goggles have a receiver in them and so does the controller.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>How long does it take to charge up the batteries?</b></span></p>
<p>Battery charging will take about 20-30 minutes per battery, you can charge faster but there a risk you will be shortening the battery life.  Most racers have 10 or more batteries so once they charge up at home they have hours of flying in the field.</p>
<p><b>How long is the flight time?</b></p>
<p>Flight time on most racing drones is between 3 and 8 minutes depending on how aggressive you are flying.  You will find this feels like a long time because of the adrenaline rush, and a rest will be required to calm your nerves.</p>
<p><b>What's the maximum range? </b></p>
<p>Maximum 'control' range starts at about 1-2km, you can upgrade to a crossfire TX and increase your maximum range to up to 100km of theoretical control.   There is also 'video' range, so at max power the video transmitter on the atom is capable of 5km or more with standard antennas.    Battery range is another factor, the Atom is estimated to be able to fly between 2-3 km's and back before running out of battery. Range is dependent on clear line of sight, so make sure you are not flying behind too many large dense objects or you may lose video/control or both and have what's called a ""failsafe"" event where your drone will disarm and power down as a safety measure.  Most drone racing or recreational flying happens within a few hundred metres of the pilot, and most countries have rules against flying beyond visual line of sight.</p>
<p><b>What is the Owner's Pack? Specifically, what are the carbon fiber frame, canopy, camera mounts, triumph antenna, and mounts?</b></p>
<p>The Owners Pack is for owners of the original V1 Atom, and you can see these pieces on the pictures and renders of the Atom V2 everywhere on the site.</p>
<p>The Carbon Fiber Frame is the main black plate that everything secures to, the canopy is the poly carbonate shell that protects the electronics, the camera mounts hold the FPV camera in place and at desired angles inside the canopy.  The triumph antenna is the FPV/Video antenna on the back/top with the bulb on top, this transmits your video in a circularly polarized fashion allowing it good penetration of objects.  The triumph mount is the bracket and cable that the antenna uses to bolt into the canopy itself, which then in turn connects to the video transmitter in the brain of the Atom, via a special flexible antenna cable.</p>
<p><b>- Can the drone fly stable and still in the same spot or is it more geared towards flying forward and fast?</b></p>
<p>The Atom is designed for manual control and surfing the skies, but it can be hovered in position just not automatically via GPS.  We recommend practice and then you will simply be able to put the Atom in any position in the sky you wish.  By using a camera angle mount with very low degree of angle you will be able to hold position quite well, or by flying in what's called ""Line of Sight"" or ""LOS"" mode, meaning you watch the drone as you control it rather than using the FPV equipment to see what it sees.</p>
<p><b>How do you take photos? (Example, selling a house) Do you have to take a Screenshot after you play the HD recorded video?</b></p>
<p>The HD camera can record to an SD Card, and capable of taking up to 2K resolution video, meaning you would be able to take high resolution individual frames from the video at around 4 megapixels.</p>

<span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;"">
<p>RotorX was formed by a small group of FPV pilots/friends that got together regularly to fly for fun, it wasn’t long before we wanted to see how small we could make an FPV racing drone to let us fly in more places than our larger, expensive, noisy and fragile drones could handle.  Our experience as pilots and technical ability as engineers and designers put us in the unique position of being able to design products that were so far ahead of the curve that we were regularly called crazy and dreamers.  Fast forward 12 months and RotorX motors and propellers are some of the most heavily cloned drone products in the market.  RotorX micro drones the RX155 raiju and RX122 atom have led a trend in the community towards smaller safer racing drones, that was recently validated by the FAA ruling on no registration required for drones less than 250grams.  Our lack of an international distribution network and financing to create large volumes of our cutting edge designs left the door open for an army of zombie cloning companies that wanted to capitalize on our popularity and designs.  We need Indiegogo to help us keep creating next level products while also pushing down costs to the customer, so that more people can afford to get into drone racing safely and share in the amazing experience of being a FPV drone pilot.  Whether it is for racing competitively, with friends or just for fun! </p>
<br/><p><b>What flight modes does the Atom V2 racer come with?</b></p>
<p>Because the Atom is designed for many different skill levels, the default mode will have low power self leveling flight mode that is a good starting point for getting used to the basic controls.  There will be several pre-programmed switches for intermediate and advanced levels of flight that will allow you to really surf the skies and race if you so desire.</p>
<br/><p><b>Does the Atom V2 have GPS, Return to Home, Follow me mode and Wi-Fi control to my smartphone?</b></p>
<p>The simple answer is NO to all of those, for many reasons that we will try to explain.  You don’t have to look very hard to find drones that have had situations where these “automated” control modes have failed, and there are many ways they can fail.  Solar flares, poorly designed hardware/software, cloud cover, and obstacles like trees and mountains are just a few of the reason why even the most expensive GPS controlled drones are susceptible to “fly-aways” let alone the cheap, low quality - but affordable - ripoffs, that flood the market.  At RotorX we feel like why should we rely so heavily on a system so proven to fail so often? Why should a robot have all the fun of flying?  The Atom, like most pure racing drones, lets you fly in what’s called manual/rate/acro mode meaning you are absolutely in control of every movement that the drone makes, and as soon as that control link is broken the drone is no longer able to operate (called failsafe) without you, a human.  How can you fly like a bird if you are using waypoints or a smartphone? These flight modes give the operator a false sense of security about their skill level and their drones reliability/handling.  Wi-Fi controlled drones have an incredibly short control range, and extremely delayed video stream that makes FPV piloting clumsy and impractical for racing.</p>
<br/><p><b>What differences are there between the Atom V1 and Atom V2 Racer?</b></p>
<p>The Atom V1 was launched on RCGroups exactly 1 year ago, and the discussion about it has now over 10000 comments and half a million views.  The V1 Atom was the first of it’s kind and required a complicated mix of over 10 individual components from different suppliers designed for much larger racing drones, meaning assembly of the Atom V1 takes around 5-10 HOURS of complicated soldering, setup and assembly, meaning only the most advanced drone builders could attempt to put them together as intended.  The Atom V2 Racer requires less than 30 minutes of assembly, and comes preconfigured and set up for operation as soon as it’s plugged together, the DIY kit only requires soldering of the motors to the central brain, and the RTF kit obviously is fully assembled and tuned for perfect flight.</p>
<br/><p><b>Why should I buy an RotorX Atom Racer over any other drone?</b></p>
<p>Very rarely does a drone come along that is this easy to use, upgrade and enjoy at a reasonable price while also being made from the highest quality components currently available.  The Atom is designed to be safe enough to learn to fly on, while quiet enough to fly without causing undue disruption to your surrounding area, meaning you can fly away from people and private property purely for fun without fear of disturbing anyone.  Additionally the Atom is a platform that is as durable as a drone should be, not just surviving many crashes without even needing to replace a propeller, but a drone that could last a lifetime if taken care of with minimal maintenance.  The modular design allows part replacement in minutes with no soldering!  When you are ready the Atom V2 is a racing machine, especially if built in the PRO configuration for ultra fast racing or carrying the HD Camera.</p>
<br/><p><b>What kind of HD Camera is in the upgrade package?</b></p>
<p>RotorX has designed a custom HD camera solution that will only work on the Atom V2 Racer, unfortunately because it is not in production yet we can’t share too many details except that it will be extremely light weight, designed to survive crashes, and record 1080p quality video onto a micro SD card.</p>
<br/><p><b>Why does the RTF kit cost $699 retail? I have seen bigger racing drones online for less.</b></p>
<p>There are a few things to consider when purchasing a RTF racing drone. Do you have a controller/transmitter? FPV Goggles or groundstation to fly in First Person View? Generally a high quality RTF racing drone with everything needed to get you flying is around $1000. Our kit is comparison is very cost effective, especially for the race calibre quality of the components included.</p>
<br/><p>The Atom costs the same or more than some 250mm sized racing drones. </p>
<p><b>Shouldn’t a micro racing drone half the size cost half as much?</b></p>
<p>This is a common misconception. We have built a drone that performs just as well or better than large, more dangerous racing drones. We have had to develop the same components and high quality electronics into a much smaller package. This in fact increases cost, rather than lessening it, due to the more intricate manufacturing process required to create quality micro and nano scale drone parts</p>
<br/><p><b>Why should I buy your micro drone, rather than a larger more common 250 sized racing drone?</b></p>
<p>There are many reasons why a micro racing drone is better than it’s larger counterparts.For Example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Crash resistance - A sub-250gram racing drone has less potential energy, and as such is less likely to cause damage to the drone, or the object it crashes into.</p></li>
<li><p>Safety - Again due to the smaller size and lighter weight, an Atom is less likely to maim or kill someone if they are unfortunate enough to walk in your path whilst flying. This doesn’t mean it is smart or safe to purposely fly them into other pilots or bystanders</p></li>
<li><p>Registration - Due to FAA regulations, sub 250gram drones do not require registration by the FAA. Meaning you can buy and fly without having to forgo privacy by having your contact details listed publicly with the FAA.</p></li>

What is that tripod device that drone racers use?
That's called a ground station, it's used for getting better reception in what are called 'multi-pathing' environments where you have a lot of racers on similar channels and interference affecting video reception.  They aren't required for most flyers who try to stay mobile, the goggles have a receiver in them and so does the controller.
How long does it take to charge up the batteries?
Battery charging will take about 20-30 minutes per battery, you can charge faster but there a risk you will be shortening the battery life.  Most racers have 10 or more batteries so once they charge up at home they have hours of flying in the field.
How long is the flight time?
Flight time on most racing drones is between 3 and 8 minutes depending on how aggressive you are flying.  You will find this feels like a long time because of the adrenaline rush, and a rest will be required to calm your nerves.
What's the maximum range? 
Maximum 'control' range starts at about 1-2km, you can upgrade to a crossfire TX and increase your maximum range to up to 100km of theoretical control.   There is also 'video' range, so at max power the video transmitter on the atom is capable of 5km or more with standard antennas.    Battery range is another factor, the Atom is estimated to be able to fly between 2-3 km's and back before running out of battery. Range is dependent on clear line of sight, so make sure you are not flying behind too many large dense objects or you may lose video/control or both and have what's called a ""failsafe"" event where your drone will disarm and power down as a safety measure.  Most drone racing or recreational flying happens within a few hundred metres of the pilot, and most countries have rules against flying beyond visual line of sight.
What is the Owner's Pack? Specifically, what are the carbon fiber frame, canopy, camera mounts, triumph antenna, and mounts?
The Owners Pack is for owners of the original V1 Atom, and you can see these pieces on the pictures and renders of the Atom V2 everywhere on the site.
The Carbon Fiber Frame is the main black plate that everything secures to, the canopy is the poly carbonate shell that protects the electronics, the camera mounts hold the FPV camera in place and at desired angles inside the canopy.  The triumph antenna is the FPV/Video antenna on the back/top with the bulb on top, this transmits your video in a circularly polarized fashion allowing it good penetration of objects.  The triumph mount is the bracket and cable that the antenna uses to bolt into the canopy itself, which then in turn connects to the video transmitter in the brain of the Atom, via a special flexible antenna cable.
- Can the drone fly stable and still in the same spot or is it more geared towards flying forward and fast?
The Atom is designed for manual control and surfing the skies, but it can be hovered in position just not automatically via GPS.  We recommend practice and then you will simply be able to put the Atom in any position in the sky you wish.  By using a camera angle mount with very low degree of angle you will be able to hold position quite well, or by flying in what's called ""Line of Sight"" or ""LOS"" mode, meaning you watch the drone as you control it rather than using the FPV equipment to see what it sees.
How do you take photos? (Example, selling a house) Do you have to take a Screenshot after you play the HD recorded video?
The HD camera can record to an SD Card, and capable of taking up to 2K resolution video, meaning you would be able to take high resolution individual frames from the video at around 4 megapixels.

Why Crowdfunding if you are already selling the Atom V1?


RotorX was formed by a small group of FPV pilots/friends that got together regularly to fly for fun, it wasn’t long before we wanted to see how small we could make an FPV racing drone to let us fly in more places than our larger, expensive, noisy and fragile drones could handle.  Our experience as pilots and technical ability as engineers and designers put us in the unique position of being able to design products that were so far ahead of the curve that we were regularly called crazy and dreamers.  Fast forward 12 months and RotorX motors and propellers are some of the most heavily cloned drone products in the market.  RotorX micro drones the RX155 raiju and RX122 atom have led a trend in the community towards smaller safer racing drones, that was recently validated by the FAA ruling on no registration required for drones less than 250grams.  Our lack of an international distribution network and financing to create large volumes of our cutting edge designs left the door open for an army of zombie cloning companies that wanted to capitalize on our popularity and designs.  We need Indiegogo to help us keep creating next level products while also pushing down costs to the customer, so that more people can afford to get into drone racing safely and share in the amazing experience of being a FPV drone pilot.  Whether it is for racing competitively, with friends or just for fun! 
What flight modes does the Atom V2 racer come with?
Because the Atom is designed for many different skill levels, the default mode will have low power self leveling flight mode that is a good starting point for getting used to the basic controls.  There will be several pre-programmed switches for intermediate and advanced levels of flight that will allow you to really surf the skies and race if you so desire.
Does the Atom V2 have GPS, Return to Home, Follow me mode and Wi-Fi control to my smartphone?
The simple answer is NO to all of those, for many reasons that we will try to explain.  You don’t have to look very hard to find drones that have had situations where these “automated” control modes have failed, and there are many ways they can fail.  Solar flares, poorly designed hardware/software, cloud cover, and obstacles like trees and mountains are just a few of the reason why even the most expensive GPS controlled drones are susceptible to “fly-aways” let alone the cheap, low quality - but affordable - ripoffs, that flood the market.  At RotorX we feel like why should we rely so heavily on a system so proven to fail so often? Why should a robot have all the fun of flying?  The Atom, like most pure racing drones, lets you fly in what’s called manual/rate/acro mode meaning you are absolutely in control of every movement that the drone makes, and as soon as that control link is broken the drone is no longer able to operate (called failsafe) without you, a human.  How can you fly like a bird if you are using waypoints or a smartphone? These flight modes give the operator a false sense of security about their skill level and their drones reliability/handling.  Wi-Fi controlled drones have an incredibly short control range, and extremely delayed video stream that makes FPV piloting clumsy and impractical for racing.
What differences are there between the Atom V1 and Atom V2 Racer?
The Atom V1 was launched on RCGroups exactly 1 year ago, and the discussion about it has now over 10000 comments and half a million views.  The V1 Atom was the first of it’s kind and required a complicated mix of over 10 individual components from different suppliers designed for much larger racing drones, meaning assembly of the Atom V1 takes around 5-10 HOURS of complicated soldering, setup and assembly, meaning only the most advanced drone builders could attempt to put them together as intended.  The Atom V2 Racer requires less than 30 minutes of assembly, and comes preconfigured and set up for operation as soon as it’s plugged together, the DIY kit only requires soldering of the motors to the central brain, and the RTF kit obviously is fully assembled and tuned for perfect flight.
Why should I buy an RotorX Atom Racer over any other drone?
Very rarely does a drone come along that is this easy to use, upgrade and enjoy at a reasonable price while also being made from the highest quality components currently available.  The Atom is designed to be safe enough to learn to fly on, while quiet enough to fly without causing undue disruption to your surrounding area, meaning you can fly away from people and private property purely for fun without fear of disturbing anyone.  Additionally the Atom is a platform that is as durable as a drone should be, not just surviving many crashes without even needing to replace a propeller, but a drone that could last a lifetime if taken care of with minimal maintenance.  The modular design allows part replacement in minutes with no soldering!  When you are ready the Atom V2 is a racing machine, especially if built in the PRO configuration for ultra fast racing or carrying the HD Camera.
What kind of HD Camera is in the upgrade package?
RotorX has designed a custom HD camera solution that will only work on the Atom V2 Racer, unfortunately because it is not in production yet we can’t share too many details except that it will be extremely light weight, designed to survive crashes, and record 1080p quality video onto a micro SD card.
Why does the RTF kit cost $699 retail? I have seen bigger racing drones online for less.
There are a few things to consider when purchasing a RTF racing drone. Do you have a controller/transmitter? FPV Goggles or groundstation to fly in First Person View? Generally a high quality RTF racing drone with everything needed to get you flying is around $1000. Our kit is comparison is very cost effective, especially for the race calibre quality of the components included.
The Atom costs the same or more than some 250mm sized racing drones. 
Shouldn’t a micro racing drone half the size cost half as much?
This is a common misconception. We have built a drone that performs just as well or better than large, more dangerous racing drones. We have had to develop the same components and high quality electronics into a much smaller package. This in fact increases cost, rather than lessening it, due to the more intricate manufacturing process required to create quality micro and nano scale drone parts
Why should I buy your micro drone, rather than a larger more common 250 sized racing drone?
There are many reasons why a micro racing drone is better than it’s larger counterparts.For Example:

Crash resistance - A sub-250gram racing drone has less potential energy, and as such is less likely to cause damage to the drone, or the object it crashes into.
Safety - Again due to the smaller size and lighter weight, an Atom is less likely to maim or kill someone if they are unfortunate enough to walk in your path whilst flying. This doesn’t mean it is smart or safe to purposely fly them into other pilots or bystanders
Registration - Due to FAA regulations, sub 250gram drones do not require registration by the FAA. Meaning you can buy and fly without having to forgo privacy by having your contact details listed publicly with the FAA.

What does RTF and DIY mean?
RTF means Ready to Fly, meaning the Drone itself is assembled, and a controller is provided meaning that you just need to connect the battery to make it go(after reading the instructions)!  DIY obviously means some assembly required, in this case it’s quite limited.  Do not be too daunted by this, there are hundreds of customers available for guidance and no question is unanswerable.
What does the RTF basic kit come with?



Atom V2 Racer


Controller with built in FPV screen and video receiver with battery


Atom Racer Batteries are not included in product shipment, but you will receive notification of where to purchase batteries locally and cheaply before your drone arrives.  This is due to a recent change in international shipping requirements for Lithium Polymer batteries.


Will we still offer our current RX122 V1 Atom kits?
Yes, but in limited supply, focus will be making Atom V2 parts available before kits are delivered
Is the Atom safe for kids?
Being micro, the Atom is safer than current full sized racing drones. Though it is still a very powerful drone, so we recommend users 14 and above.  The PRO upgrade is really not as beginner friendly at the Racer standard kit using RX1105 motors and propellers
Do I need tools?
With any racing drones, you will eventually need to modify and repair. Basic soldering iron, allen keys, pliers, screw drivers etc will get you out of trouble. Alternately, our Pro bundle comes with a small tool kit.

<h3>As many of you already know, my name is Alissa Cook and I am raising support to serve with Christ for India in New Delhi this coming summer.</h3>
<h3>It is amazing to me how intimate our God is and that He chooses to speak to us on such a personal level. I was praying to be shown where He would like me to serve this coming year and in January I had the pleasure of meeting my new friend Ranjit whose family runs Christ for India. I have known for some time that God desires me to work with children but was still surprised when this opportuinity to work with orphans in New Delhi dropped into my lap.</h3>
<h3>Christ for India is an organizaiton that works with churches, the poor, widows, and orphans across India. I will be using my gifts as a counselor to minister to the orphans there and feel truly blessed for this opportunity.</h3>
<h3>The trip will be from July 31st to August 15th and will cost $2,500 with deposits due regularly. The money will go towards transportation, room, and board. Anything that I earn extra will go directly to the ministry.</h3>
<h3>Please pray for my team as we go and that God would guide us and keep our hearts open to His leading. Please also pray that God would keep me physically well and for the individuals we will be ministering to.</h3>
<h3>I am truly thankful for whatever support you are able to provide, whether that be financially or in prayer. Both will be essential.</h3>

It is amazing to me how intimate our God is and that He chooses to speak to us on such a personal level. I was praying to be shown where He would like me to serve this coming year and in January I had the pleasure of meeting my new friend Ranjit whose family runs Christ for India. I have known for some time that God desires me to work with children but was still surprised when this opportuinity to work with orphans in New Delhi dropped into my lap.
Christ for India is an organizaiton that works with churches, the poor, widows, and orphans across India. I will be using my gifts as a counselor to minister to the orphans there and feel truly blessed for this opportunity.
The trip will be from July 31st to August 15th and will cost $2,500 with deposits due regularly. The money will go towards transportation, room, and board. Anything that I earn extra will go directly to the ministry.
Please pray for my team as we go and that God would guide us and keep our hearts open to His leading. Please also pray that God would keep me physically well and for the individuals we will be ministering to.
I am truly thankful for whatever support you are able to provide, whether that be financially or in prayer. Both will be essential.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>High quality
books of this kind are expensive to produce and the printing costs
will make out the biggest part (about € 11.000). We also have to cover the costs for
graphic design, text, translation, proofing and shipping. I have settled all my travels and other expenses over the years myself. Your
support will ensure that this book is printed to the highest
possible standards. The actual costs for my book have been calculated with € 21.500. We have received a small funding by the Austrian and County government, but there are still a lot of expenses to cover. <br/></p><p><b>This is why I

My
name is Yvonne Oswald, I am a photographer based in Vienna Austria.
Over the last years I have published six successful books on
different  topics, and my editorial work features in international magazines
like Architectural Digest, Elle Decor, Christie's Magazine, The World
of Interiors and Coté Est among others. My pictures are exhibited in
galleries and art-shows and are part of collections all over Europe.


The Südbahnhotel - the
Project 

The Südbahnhotel (or Southern Railway Hotel) up at the
Semmering mountains south of Vienna, is one of the
last untouched examples of a palace hotel and stands as a symbol
for the history of the Viennese and Central European society of the late 19th
and early 20th century.
My
photographic project started in 2009. I wanted to delve into what remained
of the sophisticated life? Would one still be able to sense the atmosphere of this exceptional time? Or only the melancholia of a
dying palace hotel? What remained of the elegant facade, the
passion and creativity of this complex society? And is the
tragedy of the sudden brutal end of this era still lingering in these rooms? 

Over countless
visits I tried to capture the spirit of intellectuals
and artists like Stefan Zweig, Arthur Schnitzler, Sigmund Freud, Gustav Mahler, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Franz
Werfel or Karl Kraus, just to name a few. All of them had an intimate
and long lasting relationship with the hotel and the region. (Stefan
Zweigs famous novel “Burning Secret” for example, takes place at the
Suedbahnhotel and his novels were also inspiration for Wes Anderson's  film The Grand Budapest Hotel) 


Magic Mountain # 12 ""untitled""; Bel Etage, room 111The Area
The
Semmering area became fashionable in the late 1870's with the construction of the southern bound railway ""Südbahn"" from Vienna to Trieste. The Südbahnhotel opened in 1882 as an alpine luxury hotel. From the very beginning, the hotel as well as the whole region, thrived under

Its decline was caused by Austria's annexation by the Nazis in 1938. Jewish citizens  were banned from all hotels and

After
WW2 the Suedbahnhotel was reopened, but could never regain its

it was finally closed and stands empty since then. 

Most other grand buildings in this alpine region have either been

graphic design, text, translation, proofing and shipping. I have settled all my travels and other expenses over the years myself. Your
support will ensure that this book is printed to the highest
possible standards. The actual costs for my book have been calculated with € 21.500. We have received a small funding by the Austrian and County government, but there are still a lot of expenses to cover. This is why I
am reaching out to the Indiegogo community.
I want this
photo book to stand as a poetic memorial of a historically important
monument of the Central European Fin de Siècle society.
Thank
you for your consideration and support!

<p> Rounds of chemo had broken everything but his young spirit. Brady could barely manage to get himself, let alone fifty pounds of gear, into the deep country mountains. It quickly became evident that his father and I would need to carry his load...  but we didn't have enough arms! </p>
<p>We shoved tents down shirts and carried bags in our mouths! For him to truly live life to the fullest we needed a helping hand. So that was the night Brady Packs were born!</p>
<p>VERY SAD UPDATE.  Soon after this campaign went up Brady's health turned for the worst.  On Monday December 14th, 2015 Brady Powers Mickey passed away.  We were expecting that someday he would not be here, we just didn't think it would be so fast.  We took a couple of weeks to honor Brady and his wonderful family and now we will go even harder to honor his memory and legacy.  Any contributions coming into Brady Packs that do not buy a product will go to Brady Powers SAS.  The SAS stands for School of Apprentice Studies.  We will miss you Brady.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Brady Packs has a very unique advantage over most of the crowdfunding campaigns out there.  Brady Packs is part of a industrial and a commercial cooperative called Together Jobs.  Together Jobs is designed to create many jobs in this country.  The following video will help explain Together Jobs  <a href=""https://youtu.be/VnR2y_9Fqmg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://youtu.be/VnR2y_9Fqmg</a>.  </p>
<p>The other advantage that exist with Brady Packs is that all of our products have been designed, built and tested.  All processes in manufacturing, training, inventories and shipping has been developed.  Sufficient inventories for manufacturing has already been obtained.  As stated earlier, Brady Packs is part of a cooperative.  This means that a membership is required in order to buy our products or work for us.  There is a specific reason for that and the following video helps explain that and how easy that membership is obtained.   Break it down for folks in more detail:<a href=""https://youtu.be/Rw3OQPwzqbo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://youtu.be/Rw3OQPwzqbo</a>.  </p>
<p>The more you find out about Brady Packs and Together Jobs and the other companies that will soon follow, you will realize how all of this is more than just products, it's  movement.  A movement that will transform rural America and our nation into more of a manufacturing nation instead of mostly a import nation.</p>
<p>Brady Packs also wants to be very clear about what happens if we don't receive the minimum amount or even in the case if we would receive much more than the minimum.  All funds, no matter how much, will go to making and shipping the orders.  </p> <ul>  </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>My Board of Advisors and I have spent several years developing abroad range of products beginning with Brady Packs that will help bring manufacturing jobs back to this country as well as great products at or lower than those for imported goods.  You have only seen the basics of Brady Packs This product line is endless and it all came about because of one very sick young man.  Through your support his family will get very needed help and Brady wil never be forgotten.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>

<p>
</p>
<p>We at Brady Packs and Together Jobs believe very strongly in
crowfunding, especially Indiegogo.  All
of this actually started 10 years ago right after hurricane Katrina.  Over that period many business strategies
were researched to start a company that could not only be successful but would
become an entity that would bring about positive enhancements to this great
nation and its people.  </p>
<p>There is always risk in any venture, especially one of these
magnitudes.  We feel that as much of that
risk as possible was addressed by the fact that all testing and processes were
completed beforehand and manufacturing space ready. More than enough resources
are either in house or available to handle orders.  </p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:</p> <ul> <li>
<p>I really hope you read this part.  The only way all of this was put together is
because we as group finally made a decision to look objectively without bias at
this nation.  We started at the turn of
the 20<sup>th</sup> century to today. 
Where this nation was then and where it is now and how we got here.  We did it without blame or personal
interest.  From that point we sit down
and rationalized and even dreamed of where we want this nation to be.  At that point came the most rewarding part of
our expedition.  When each person finally
decided to look at the options without blame or personal bias a path was
started.  It took a long time but we believe
that this is the best jobs plan out there and the great thing is we don’t have
to change anything to do it.  We don’t
have to lobby Congress or get the President behind us.  We don’t have to change the education system or
rob other good employers of their employees. 
We don’t have to sell shares or borrow money.  </p>
<p>Sounds impossible, its not. 
We just need members to be part of this movement.  Not like most cooperatives where you have to
pay every year and for that you get a card and the right to buy there.  With us you get a beautiful product that
actually someone has to make and its good forever.  No matter how rich you are you can’t buy more
than one membership per person and can’t get more out of it than any other
person.  Believe me when I say that we
are inclusive not exclusive.  We will be
starting a program soon that if you can’t afford a membership, arrangements
will be made.  </p>
<p>Here is how each of you can help.  Yes buying our products are important and
buying our memberships are important. 
Also the $10 that you give will do more than you can ever imagine but it
is also very important that you spread the word.  Talk about it and share it with friends.  Businesses out there buy a membership and we
will make the board so you can put it on your wall.  There is nothing that will help your business
than more local people working in good paying jobs and off social
programs.  This will spread to every
state in just a few months.</p>

</div><div>We've used a lot of different water bottles, and the design and functions of each create a unique experience. While keeping away from some designs, others inspired us (like the Platypus hydration pack, Bubi, and S'well). We wanted to create a bottle that stood for nothing more than the essentials in its design, and we feel we've done just that. The bottle's durable body bends and fits pretty much anywhere while the rugged firestarter gets the flame going. The 8ft of strong paracord let the MWB meet all your nature needs. </div><div><br/></div><div>

</div><div><br/></div><div>We saw a gap in water bottles while searching for the right one. We can’t stand not having water around... I’m sure you feel the same, you little fish you. We didn’t like the bulky plastic water bottles because, well, they were too darn bulky and in the way, plus they'd crack if they had a good tumble. We didn’t like the metals because they make so much noise when in contact with keys or zippers from your bag, plus they stay dented forever. We did not like the water bladder bags because handling them with water feels odd and unstable… Finally, we didn't like that the water bottle was only about water; why not add something more? We were just unsatisfied with what was available. So, we took to the white boards and came to the MWB. </div><div>

<br/>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>We’re extremely passionate about the MWB and we’re committed to doing everything in our power to solve any challenges that may arise along the way – that’s a promise!</p>
<p>We have to make sure everything goes according to plan to meet our promised deadlines. We have our manufacturing and operations all ready to go, and we've made sure to leave enough time so that all of your MWB's will arrive as planned. We are confident that our calculated plan will work effectively once we're funded, and that we'll be putting the MWB in your hands for all your everyday tasks -- and more -- by December!</p>
<br/>
</div></div>","Using durable high-grade silicone, we’ve created a minimalistic water bottle that rolls up and stores into a quarter of its actual size – not to mention the sturdy paracord and firestarter that make the MWB a complete survival tool.








We've used a lot of different water bottles, and the design and functions of each create a unique experience. While keeping away from some designs, others inspired us (like the Platypus hydration pack, Bubi, and S'well). We wanted to create a bottle that stood for nothing more than the essentials in its design, and we feel we've done just that. The bottle's durable body bends and fits pretty much anywhere while the rugged firestarter gets the flame going. The 8ft of strong paracord let the MWB meet all your nature needs. 










We saw a gap in water bottles while searching for the right one. We can’t stand not having water around... I’m sure you feel the same, you little fish you. We didn’t like the bulky plastic water bottles because, well, they were too darn bulky and in the way, plus they'd crack if they had a good tumble. We didn’t like the metals because they make so much noise when in contact with keys or zippers from your bag, plus they stay dented forever. We did not like the water bladder bags because handling them with water feels odd and unstable… Finally, we didn't like that the water bottle was only about water; why not add something more? We were just unsatisfied with what was available. So, we took to the white boards and came to the MWB. 









We travel a lot and are outdoors at every chance we get. Packing for such things should be an easy task, but often can turn into a complicated and indecisive one. We feel things now-a-days are made too complicated and/or with too many pieces to complete them. We love to see things made thoughtfully and tactfully.  








While designing the MWB, we wanted a feature piece that would make our bottle distinguishable from anything out there. So, we put our efforts into the attachment piece. We wanted it to compliment the person holding the bottle, its environment, and of course the bottle itself. We have three Words for you: Paracord & Flint (Yes were considering the ampersand a word… debatable indeed!). All together creating the most foundational elements known and needed for humans everywhere; water and fire. 


A Steel Ribbed Ring Made & Designed To Scrape Your Tinder & Flint For Easy Flames. 








LETS TALK WASTE: In the U.S alone, more than 60 million plastic bottles end up in landfills and incinerators every day. Just last year, plastic bottles total'd to 22 billion!And even though a lot of us do our very best by standing in front of the waste units deciding on what darn color and shape of hole correlates to recycling (yeah it gets confusing), it’s still not enough. At least 80% of these plastics end up in our landfills, streets, parks and beaches.  

We can help decrease this number considerably. We have created a useful and handy water bottle better than anything out there that empowers you to go anywhere and do anything. So please join us in making our goal a reality. Lets try changing this for the better.

<p>We are three german hikers who want to walk a coast-to-coast traverse of Iceland. While there have been several cross-country hikes, we're trying to do it on a new route. We'll publish detailed information about how to tackle an Iceland traverse when we will have returned, thus creating an opportunity for everybody to repeat it. Additionally, you will be able to experience the harshness of Iceland, watching our trip-video at home with a steaming mug of tea.</p>
<h3>Who we are</h3>
<ul>
<li>Thorsten, our expert in ultralight equipment. He got some experience in hiking and mountaineering and recently got into long distance trekking.</li>
<li>Ben is a climber, skier and the current leader in the german adventure race series 2013 (challenger - mixed).</li>
<li>David is our language professional and has made several hiking trips around europe. He also was the brain behind our perks, so check them out!</li>
</ul><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We set the funding at 500$ which we need to cover transport in Iceland, lodging for the first and the last night in Iceland and for all the food we're going to take with us. With 500$ we have neither gear, nor flights covered, so every additional cent is a big deal for us!</p>
<p>Transport: 210$ (Bus transport is expensive in Iceland)</p>
<p>Lodging: 60$ (10$ a night is the least you can get in Reykjavik)</p>
<p>Food: 230$ (We're going to take almost 50kg/100pounds of food with us, which we will buy in Germany and prepare ourselves)</p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
If our campaign receives more than 500$, we offer 2 specials:</div>
<div>
<p>If the funding reaches $750, we'll jump into the sea at the start AND the end of our tour.</p>
<p>If the funding reaches $1000, every contributer will be asked to send us his estimation of how long the tour is going to take us. The closest bet will win a hiking trip (for more information see the corresponding perk).</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
Iceland is and has always been a magnet for hikers because of its overwhelming beauty and uniqueness. Altough there are some established hiking routes, the biggest part of the island isn't covered with markers. If you support us, we'll publish enough information for you to repeat this tour and experience the remote parts of Iceland. Additionally, you will be able to watch our trip movie.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We know what it's like to be on a tight budget, so if you don't have the money to support us...</p>
<ul>
<li>...spread the word, that some guys wanna realize a cool project</li>
<li>...let us sleep at your appartment in or around Reykjavik before or at the end of our trip, so we can save the money for hostels. Story telling included for sure!</li>
<li>...sponsor us gear - we still need some stuff and would publish a review in return. Contact via email.</li>

<p>The <span><a href=""http://salemtrails.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Salem Area Trail Alliance</a> </span>(SATA) is a
grassroots organization that seeks to design, build and maintain nearby
non-motorized trails for health enhancing recreational opportunities while
preserving and improving our local green spaces. We are a Chapter of the
International Mountain Bike Association (<a href=""https://www.imba.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">IMBA</a>) with 501(c)3 non-profit
designation. Your donation is tax deductible (Federal Tax ID #: 27-3185043)!</p>
<p><span>One of our most ambitious and exciting projects has been the development of a trail facility and bike park in Salem, Oregon nestled in at the north end of Wallace Marine Park.  We've been working through the planning phase with the City of Salem for the past three years and its time to move forward.</span></p>

<p></p>
<p></p>
</div><div>Our vision for the facility is to design a space that everyone can enjoy, a recreational hub for kids and the young at heart, a safe place for families - a playground for all of Salem!</div><div>
<p>
</p>
<p>In 2012, we held two design workshops and asked you what you wanted out of this facility. Thanks to a technical assistance grant from the <a href=""http://www.nps.gov/orgs/rtca/index.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">National Parks Rivers, Trails and Conservation Assistance Program</a> and a generous in-kind donation from <a href=""http://www.secterenvironmentaldesign.com/team.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sector Environmental Design</a>, the concept map you see below was developed. The facility will include ~2 miles of cross-country trails (single-track) and two <a href=""http://www.peopleforbikes.org/blog/entry/a-pump-track-for-the-people-of-philadelphia"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">pump tracks</a> - one track will be dedicated to young children and beginners, the other will challenge more advance riders. The cross-country trails will integrate 8-10 bicycle <a href=""http://progressivebikeramps.com/trail-features-2/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">trail features</a> throughout.<br/></p>

<h3>What We Need </h3>

We’ve discussed the project with several trail organizations in the northwest that utilized volunteers to build similar facilities. They all stated that they wished they had brought in the pros. Professional designers and builders are just that - professional! They do these types of projects everyday. One key element of the design/build process is to engage volunteers along the way. When discussing the project with professional firms, SATA has expressed its desire to ensure volunteers are integrated into the entire process - design to build.

The Salem Area Trail Alliance (SATA) is a
grassroots organization that seeks to design, build and maintain nearby
non-motorized trails for health enhancing recreational opportunities while
preserving and improving our local green spaces. We are a Chapter of the
International Mountain Bike Association (IMBA) with 501(c)3 non-profit
designation. Your donation is tax deductible (Federal Tax ID #: 27-3185043)!
One of our most ambitious and exciting projects has been the development of a trail facility and bike park in Salem, Oregon nestled in at the north end of Wallace Marine Park.  We've been working through the planning phase with the City of Salem for the past three years and its time to move forward.




Our vision for the facility is to design a space that everyone can enjoy, a recreational hub for kids and the young at heart, a safe place for families - a playground for all of Salem!


In 2012, we held two design workshops and asked you what you wanted out of this facility. Thanks to a technical assistance grant from the National Parks Rivers, Trails and Conservation Assistance Program and a generous in-kind donation from Sector Environmental Design, the concept map you see below was developed. The facility will include ~2 miles of cross-country trails (single-track) and two pump tracks - one track will be dedicated to young children and beginners, the other will challenge more advance riders. The cross-country trails will integrate 8-10 bicycle trail features throughout.


Larger view
What We Need 
Everything is falling into place to make this vision a reality. SATA will work with the City of Salem to hire a professional design and construction firm to conduct most of the heavy lifting. The chosen firm will work closely with SATA, the City of Salem and most importantly - you! Estimates for the facility, including design fees, have ranged from $90k-120k.

*Costs will increase by 25% with hardened surfaces.


This facility will be funded 100% by private donations and grants. Hiring a design and build firm is expensive but necessary to ensure a high quality facility. 

I am a runner/walker. What's in it for me?


Beautiful, connected, safer, and, in some sections, separated trails! The increased positive use of the area will improve user safety and visibility. One of our first tasks will be to clear out the invasive vegetation to create improved site lines and visibility for all users. Separated trail ""off shoots"" will be constructed in sections of the facility where bikers want to gain speed - reducing runner/biker conflicts.

What's a Trail Feature?

Here are some examples of trail features that will be integrated throughout the trail facility. These would be directional (one-way) off shoots from the main cross country trail. Thanks to Progressive Bike Ramps for sharing.






Why Wallace Marine?
SATA brought the idea to the City of Salem in 2011. We discussed the facility and its goals with City officials. For various reasons Wallace Marine Park was chosen as an ideal location:


Long history of biking, running and walking in the park;


Proximity to downtown;


Access via the Union St Bridge;


Pre-existing trails and other infrastructure (i.e., parking lot, restrooms, water)


The desire for positive use in a neglected section of the park; and,

Proximity to the softball complex.

The Impact

 This project, when complete, will help to make Salem more livable for its current residents and prospective ones. Amenities like this facility have the potential to drive our community socially and economically. One of the reasons we're starting with Wallace (yes we want to build more!) is that this facility will compliment the nationally recognized softball complex.

We call it YAKET ICE... the only ice you'll need for your cooler!</h3><p>Regular ice can be great for cooling... but you need to fill up your cooler up for it to be most effective and it often ends up a melted soggy mess. Ice packs are a great concept... they offer great convenience but most are generally ineffective at really cooling beverages when compared to ice. Some of them even market themselves as ‘chillers’.

<li>The cooling gel (non-toxic) does not lose it's cooling effectiveness over time.  </li>
<li>The housing is durable HDPE plastic (recyclable) molded extra thick to handle the 3lb+ pack weight and to keep it's shape over time.</li>
<li>The seal point is a special small diameter 'over cap'... which we believe to be more durable and long lasting versus a typical larger  'plug-style' seal.</li>
<li>We've thermally stressed the packs by taking them straight out of the freezer onto a 100+ degree deck... and repeated. No issues.</li>
<li>We've physically stressed them... packs have been drop tested 24 times from 3 feet onto concrete. No issues.</li>
<li>The ICE band is molded from high tear strength silicone.  It's not a flimsy part, these will last years and years.  I've tried to 'snap' one by over stretching and I can't do it!  No issues.</li>
</ul><p>We've designed/configured a premium, long lasting product. The reality is that when you manufacture products in higher quantities, some things can go wrong occasionally.  We're all about making a quality product and providing exceptional customer service.  If you experience a product issue, we're here to take care of it (we've been in business over 10 years now).</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504611006/a8mfw4qu3zddxlky5t7p.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>Super Cold Considerations</h3><ul>
<li>Due to the pack size/weight and the -15C/5F freeze point, it takes about 36hrs. to freeze a room temperature pack in a normal freezer (most consumer freezers are set at -18C/0F or lower).  If you intend to use YAKET ICE daily... pledge for two or more:)</li>

We’re brothers Brian & Dan… and we're making the World's Best Icepack for Beverages. We call it YAKET ICE... the only ice you'll need for your cooler!Regular ice can be great for cooling... but you need to fill up your cooler up for it to be most effective and it often ends up a melted soggy mess. Ice packs are a great concept... they offer great convenience but most are generally ineffective at really cooling beverages when compared to ice. Some of them even market themselves as ‘chillers’. Would you rather have a ‘chilled’ beverage or an ‘ice cold beverage’?  We believe we've designed the world's best beverage ice pack… better than a typical ice pack and even better than ice in many ways. Read on for the details... While YAKET ICE is a very unique product, it’s fundamentally still an ICE PACK with all of the inherent benefits… leave one (or two or three) in your freezer and it’s grab and go when you need it. It won’t ‘melt’ and make a pool in your cooler. Go ahead and add snacks, sandwiches, etc. to your cooler without worrying about drowning them.  The pack is much larger than a typical scalloped beverage ice pack… weighing in at just over 3 lbs. The reasoning is simple, a bigger pack has much more cooling capability to get your drinks colder, faster… and keep them colder, longer.Shape-wise the pack is longer and wider, but we’ve also made the pack taller than typical scalloped packs to better match beverage sizes. Overall, it's 9.9"" X 3.25"" X 5"". While the pack is ‘larger’, it still fits in many ‘small’ sized coolers.  When using with cans, you can even stack them if that works best for your cooler size.ColderWe use the best/coldest cooling fluid. Our pack freezes at 5F (-15C)... most packs freeze at 32F (0C). The 5F (-15C) cooling gel is much more expensive... but we're out to make it the best pack, not the cheapest pack. InnovativeWe’ve designed a compression ICE BAND to assure your pack and beverage always remain in contact.  The band is held securely in place by grooved features on the pack ends.The ICE BAND is key to promoting maximum heat flow between the beverage and pack through conduction. We have a patent pending on our innovative pack design.Lastly, we designed standoffs on the bottom of the pack to limit how much of the pack touches the bottom of the cooler. We're all about maximizing YAKET ICE's ability to make your beverage cold. PerformanceCooling CapabilityThere are many factors that come into play when reviewing pack performance.  Beverage type, beverage size, beverage starting temperature, cooler type, cooler size, ambient temperature, how frequently the cooler is opened and closed... to name a few. We've optimized YAKET ICE for 'outings' use... think tailgating, a day at the beach, a BYO cookout, etc.  As such, we want the pack to get beverages super cold as fast as possible... and keep them very cold for at least 12 hours... with no extra ice required.We're not testing in best-case scenarios. To highlight the cooling capability, the testing below was done on 16oz water bottles... these are 33% larger than your typical 12oz beverage.Again, we're not testing in best-case scenarios. All testing was performed in medium sized, inexpensive consumer grade coolers (think Coleman/Igloo not YETI). The better your cooler, the better your long term cold keeping performance will be.DurabilityThe packs are constructed to last years and years.  Again, we're trying to make it the best... not the cheapest.  
The cooling gel (non-toxic) does not lose it's cooling effectiveness over time.  
The housing is durable HDPE plastic (recyclable) molded extra thick to handle the 3lb+ pack weight and to keep it's shape over time.
The seal point is a special small diameter 'over cap'... which we believe to be more durable and long lasting versus a typical larger  'plug-style' seal.
We've thermally stressed the packs by taking them straight out of the freezer onto a 100+ degree deck... and repeated. No issues.
We've physically stressed them... packs have been drop tested 24 times from 3 feet onto concrete. No issues.
The ICE band is molded from high tear strength silicone.  It's not a flimsy part, these will last years and years.  I've tried to 'snap' one by over stretching and I can't do it!  No issues.
We've designed/configured a premium, long lasting product. The reality is that when you manufacture products in higher quantities, some things can go wrong occasionally.  We're all about making a quality product and providing exceptional customer service.  If you experience a product issue, we're here to take care of it (we've been in business over 10 years now).Super Cold Considerations
Due to the pack size/weight and the -15C/5F freeze point, it takes about 36hrs. to freeze a room temperature pack in a normal freezer (most consumer freezers are set at -18C/0F or lower).  If you intend to use YAKET ICE daily... pledge for two or more:)
Can my drink get too cold?  Depending on factors, it's possible to freeze or partially freeze drinks. We've partially frozen 12oz bottled waters.  Most beers and sodas are carbonated and under pressure... both of which lower the freeze point to ~28F.  YAKET ICE will get them there!  We've not frozen an unopened beer or soda outright, but we've iced up a few upon opening and releasing the pressure and carbonation.  If in doubt, a minute out of the cooler before opening will typically take care of any issue.

Visitors know that when they go to see this “show”, put on by Mother Nature, that they are guaranteed an awesome experience no matter the weather, season or time of day.  Just like the geyser, you can count on the Ol’ Faithful Pullover to be there for you through thick and thin, no matter the weather or adventure.  A companion that enables you to flow with ease from work to play, day to night, and however you choose to Give’r.  And the secret sauce?  Just wait ‘til you feel it…Do you spend way too much time trying to decide what layers you need to wear or bring on a trip?  Are you often anxious that you will be too cold, too hot, or just not prepared?The Ol’ Faithful Midweight Pullover is the last hoodie you’ll ever need. It is perfect for all weather and any kind of adventure. With the Ol’ Faithful, you can enjoy more flexibility and the capacity to do what you love to the maximum of your ability. We’ve designed the Ol’ Faithful with a kick ass blend of materials to ensure superior performance and function while enabling the versatility that mirrors our ever-evolving needs.  We’ve worked tirelessly over several years to ensure durability, comfort, functionality, and practicality, all without compromise, to create a go-to layer that will last a lifetime. The technical foundation is complemented by a sharp and clean aesthetic, while simultaneously (and very much covertly) ensuring your “comfort meter” is perpetually off the charts.  Don’t take our word for it, just wait ‘til you feel it.We identified and used only premium materials to ensure superior performance from our hoodie. We wanted to make sure you could depend on Ol’ Faithful no matter what Mother Nature throws at you. We’re proud of our extensive testing and deliberation, and beyond stoked with the final result.The 11.2 oz weight Ol’ Faithful features a dense, yet ultra-soft synthetic material that is the bread and butter of this creation.  The material is composed of two distinct elements:The exterior of the layer contains 95% polyester and 5% spandex, providing structure and protection (like an exoskeleton) that blocks wind and precipitation, retains heat and insulates, without being cumbersome, bulky or restrictive.The interior of the layer contains 85% polyester and 15% spandex, woven in a unique fashion resulting in the plush and cozy feel that is truly without comparison. Several testers, charged with describing the closest comparison to the feel of the material, stated the following:Yep, it’s THAT SOFT.  The weave ensures that the softness, texture, and feel does not break down, ensuring Ol’ Faithful remains your go-to for the long haul.Unlike many cotton or down based layers, the Ol’ Faithful is made with synthetic materials where loft and insulative properties are maintained even if they get wet, ensuring you keep warm and able to keep given’r. Additionally, the material allows for much quicker drying as the fibers don’t attach and trap water molecules.During high activity, the performance fabric wicks moisture and sweat away from your body, regulating your temperature, much like an extension of your own skin.  This keeps you warmer, drier, and more comfortable so you’re able to bob and weave through your daily activities, enjoying the ride knowing the Ol’ Faithful has your back.When we say that this hoodie will last you a lifetime, we mean it.  We explored hundreds of fabrics and materials, seeking a combo that was stain resistant and that wouldn’t deteriorate or shrink over time.We did not play around...and we left no stone unturned...or fabric untested.  Wash it as much as you want and - BAM! You practically have a new hoodie each time.Don’t believe us? Hear it from one of our testers!Get ready for the softest, most comfortable outdoor hoodie ever. The selected material is SO SOFT and SO COMFORTABLE, you’ll feel you’re being cuddled in by a dozen puppies - all while still being protected from any weather encountered on your adventures.The Ol’ Faithful is made of EXTREMELY soft and plush material, though it is covert to any onlooker. Seriously, you won’t believe it until you feel it.It’s softer than your best blanket or anything you’ve ever felt. It’s the type of material that can’t be put into words...you’ll just show people and say, “you gotta feel it!”.Over the last few years, we’ve learned a lot about sizing, fit and what people want in a midweight performance layer. We’ve spoken and listened to our Ambassadors, friends, family members, co-workers, Give’r community members and well, pretty much everyone we know or who we could convince to talk to us. As we gathered more intel, we continued to refine and craft the Ol’ Faithful to a new level of commitment.We landed on a simply sleek, minimalist look with a slight taper so you can give’r while embracing the “look good, feel good” mentality.  Look good no matter if you’re on the slopes or out on a date - with the Ol’ Faithful, you can dress it up or dress it down, and pretty much wear it all around!When guys and gals began trying to sneak out of the Give’r Garage still wearing the prototype (again, and again, and again)...we knew we hit the sweet spot! The Ol’ Faithful was designed and created to be your true go-to midweight pullover that reminds you to always give it your all in everything you do and to never hold back.From concept and initial design through iterations and fine-tuning, we’ve maintained laser focus on the essentials and ensuring no detail was overlooked.  With the Ol’ Faithful, you will not find any unnecessary, superficial or sub-par features.What you get is a year-round, lifelong, adventure-tested mid-layer that is superior in every aspect and on every front - from performance & functionality to comfort and style. No more, no less.The thumbholes offer the perfect range of protection and warmth without slowing you down or restricting flexibility. Reinforced for longevity and positioned for ease of use.Keep your phone or any other of your precious valuables safe and secure with the pocket located conveniently on your chest. No need to worry about them getting lost or falling out - the zipper will keep everything exactly where it needs to be.Utilizing the soft, plush material along the inside of the hood easily makes this the best hood ever. The tri-panel pattern eliminates any awkward points or folds, and ensures you’re toasty, nimble and cozy for as long as you need or want.Truly, this is the one hoodie to rule them all. No matter who you are, where you are, or what you’re wearing it for, the Ol’ Faithful is a perfect companion for your life and adventures!Designed to be your go-to for the lifestyle you choose to live, Ol’ Faithful will live up to all of your expectations.

Whenever and wherever you choose to wear your hoodie, the versatility Ol’ Faithful offers quickly makes it a favorite. Everyone, from your significant other to your baby niece or nephew, will want to steal your Ol’ Faithful hoodie.The unisex design makes it a great fit for anyone. Plus, it’s insanely comfortable. Can you blame them?At Give’r, we strive to live a life with less regret. We know that living a life true to yourself requires absolute courage. This courage is not always easily accessible or common to observe throughout our day-to-day. The Ol’ Faithful isn’t just a hoodie - it’s a reminder to harness and ignite the courage inside each of us to give life our all, every day. When we align with our passion and choose to give life our all, the feeling is unmistakable and keeps the fire burning.

<p>It started with a college student who had too many devices in her flat. My laptops, camera, smartphones, power bank, table, stereo … they all need be plugged in, usually at the same time. There was really not much space to spare in my tiny apartment; the bulky power strips I used was just taking a lot of unnecessary space, not to mention the thick messy cables flying all around.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i66.tinypic.com/2ztcaia.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>As a frequent traveller, I know that travel adapter is a necessity on the trip. But not many people realize that power strip, is also a necessity. We complain that there’s not enough electric socket or USB charging port at the airport and in the hotel. The reality is, we need power strips while traveling, but we don’t bring them. And the reason is simple: Power strips, or power cubes, are way too bulky; and they aren’t able to adapt to different socket types. The fact is, there is no power strip on the market, Kickstarter projects included, that is able to keep its cord under control: cord storage and length adjustability are essential, but lacking in all the power strips out there.</p>

<p>The idea of MOGICS Power Donut (and Bagel, which is an universal version of Donut - UK, EU, AU, US) is to design something elegant and powerful. Integrating with the MOGICS Adapter, we are able to combine both the functions of a power strip and a travel adapter - both of which are conventionally big and bulky - to create the perfect travel solution, with added perks such as Integrated Length-adjustable Cord, spare Safety Fuse, dual USB ports supporting Fast Charge, as well as an ergonomically designed AC plug -- all this, light and slim enough to slide effortlessly in your pocket.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1483510463/alwbcwpmmrao3ycwmcyi.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>On the other hand, when I’m not traveling, MOGICS Power Donut serves as the best power strip (or power ring) in my daily life; keeping my desk neat and impeccably organized. Sharing the power on-the-go, and saving the space when you're alone.</p>

</div><div><h3> </h3></div></div>","Short Summary

It started with a college student who had too many devices in her flat. My laptops, camera, smartphones, power bank, table, stereo … they all need be plugged in, usually at the same time. There was really not much space to spare in my tiny apartment; the bulky power strips I used was just taking a lot of unnecessary space, not to mention the thick messy cables flying all around.
 

As a frequent traveller, I know that travel adapter is a necessity on the trip. But not many people realize that power strip, is also a necessity. We complain that there’s not enough electric socket or USB charging port at the airport and in the hotel. The reality is, we need power strips while traveling, but we don’t bring them. And the reason is simple: Power strips, or power cubes, are way too bulky; and they aren’t able to adapt to different socket types. The fact is, there is no power strip on the market, Kickstarter projects included, that is able to keep its cord under control: cord storage and length adjustability are essential, but lacking in all the power strips out there.



The idea of MOGICS Power Donut (and Bagel, which is an universal version of Donut - UK, EU, AU, US) is to design something elegant and powerful. Integrating with the MOGICS Adapter, we are able to combine both the functions of a power strip and a travel adapter - both of which are conventionally big and bulky - to create the perfect travel solution, with added perks such as Integrated Length-adjustable Cord, spare Safety Fuse, dual USB ports supporting Fast Charge, as well as an ergonomically designed AC plug -- all this, light and slim enough to slide effortlessly in your pocket.
On the other hand, when I’m not traveling, MOGICS Power Donut serves as the best power strip (or power ring) in my daily life; keeping my desk neat and impeccably organized. Sharing the power on-the-go, and saving the space when you're alone.
 
 

Product Spec.


Donut  vs Bagel


Integrated Safety Fuse 
Apart from the integrated Safety Fuse we already installed inside, for added security, an additional spare fuse (also 6.3A) is stored within MOGICS Power Donut as well as Bagel.

Supports 2.0A USB Fast Charge, and with 2 USB ports, MOGICS Power Donut and Bagel gives you a more efficient charging experience.
 A brilliant blue LED indicator lights up when Donut or Bagel is plugged into an AC socket source; when you see blue light, you'll know power is connected.

Production & Delivery
We have already successfully produced the first batch of MOGICS Donut & Bagel, which have been shipped out and received.

Being involved with audio every day and going out for a run in the evening, I got the idea to combine both and create this audio adventure.I have been dreaming of building this app for about a year until finally I just started doing it. As by wonder, I found a group of people interested and willing to help me do it. A great writer, an audio actor, a graphic-talent and a programming wiz crossed my path at about the same time. It's seemed like the Universe thought the time was right for Epic Run App to be born. Besides my passion for music and audio. I love sports and I always seem to want to take them to the extreme (kind of like I did with Epic Run App!). I am very much into running, bouldering (a type of technical climbing without ropes), but I am also a rescue diver, I drove drove my motorcycle alone to Italy and I climbed a vulcano in Indonesia! Who know what crazy things will happen in Epic Run App! It's a whole new concept! Your donation could help millions of runners enjoy their run and thus help keep their bodies healthy! Let's taking the boring out of running.What We Need & What You GetMost funding is needed to actually finish programming the app.Programming a user-friendly app takes time and resources. We are self funding everything right now out of our own pockets. We'll use the money from this campaign to get a lot of the programming done, make sure it is a bug free and nicely designed app for iOS (and later on for Android with your support). Currently, the back-end is already in place, but we need more resources to polish and finish the app.On the creative part of the project, we'll invest money in decent recording equipment (hiss free microphone etc), make time to write the stories, record and produce them. Graphics will be designed for optimal user experience and the website will allow sharing of runs via facebook/runkeeper/etc... You will also be able to download your GPS data (gpx format).We will also invest in promotion and advertisement of the app and conversion from iPhone to Android.As you see, a lot of work needs to be done. But our team is ready for it! We are so excited to work on this project!We are making this for you! We hope to have Epic Run App available for your phone by spring (summer at the latest) when it's time to go running again! Every run you make with the app will be as a secret agent saving the world! (who ever said running is boring?).We thought of some nice perks for sponsors, so please give us a nudge, our team will be forever grateful! The more fund we get, the more of a professional app we can deliver.Even if we don't reach the entire goal, your donation, however small, will give us a push to keep working on this product. If we go over the goal, we will make the app even better, include more and more seasons, more features, make it really easy to use, even more stories and invest in creating a real community around it.Get in style with the T-shirt and running outfit!Secret agents might be secret, but they don't go out of style! Our designer is working on a t-shirt and a full running outfit. Grab one while you can! (see Trail runner and Secret angent sponsorship package).Get the poster!Get totally emerged in the experience. We're developing a big poster to get you totally into the game, even at home! Check out the Trail runner sponsorship package. Don't miss out while you can!Make running fun again! Your donation helps millions of runners enjoy their run and thus help keep their bodies healthy! Let's taking the boring out of running.Epic Run App turns running in an entertaining, captive experience where you are the main character.

ist Crowdfunding?</b></h4>
<p>Die genaue Übersetzung würde
„Schwarmfinanzierung“ heißen. Statt eines einzelnen Geldgebers tragen viele zur
Finanzierung eines Projekts oder Produkts bei: die Crowd, eine Masse von
Leuten. Der Unterschied zu einer normalen Spendenaktion ist aber, dass Du eine <b>Gegenleistung für Deinen Beitrag</b>
bekommst. <b>Du bezahlst sozusagen per Vorauskassa</b> für ein Dankeschön Deiner Wahl
– und das finden wir super!</p><h4><br/></h4><h4>
</h4><h4><b>Wie
funktioniert der Spendenprozess?</b></h4>
<p>Das Spenden ist in <b>3 einfache Schritte</b> gegliedert. Zuerst
wählst Du auf der Hauptseite unserer Kampagne Dein Dankeschön (im Fachjargon
heißt das „Perk“) aus. In <b>Schritt 1</b>
hast Du die (optionale) Möglichkeit, einen zusätzlichen Betrag als Geschenk
festzulegen. Darunter kannst Du ein Häkchen setzen, wenn Dein Name nicht auf
der Kampagnenseite gezeigt werden soll. Unterhalb des Pflichtfelds für eine
E-Mail Adresse gibst Du Deine Adresse an, an die wir nach erfolgreicher
Kampagne Dein Dankeschön versenden werden. In <b>Schritt 2</b> geht’s zur Bezahlung via Paypal bzw. Kreditkarte und in <b>Schritt 3</b> hast Du die Möglichkeit,
unsere Kampagne via Facebook etc. zu teilen.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h4><b>Wie
funktioniert der Bezahlprozess?</b></h4>
<p>Bei Indiegogo gibt es nur die
Möglichkeit, mit <b>Paypal oder Kreditkarte</b>
zu bezahlen. Auch Kreditkartenzahlungen werden von Paypal abgewickelt, einen
Account bei Paypal brauchst Du dafür aber nicht. Das heißt: Am Ende des
Spendenprozesses kannst Du dich entweder bei Paypal einloggen oder direkt Deine
Kreditkartennummer eingeben. Diese Daten bekommt nur Paypal, sie werden nicht
an uns oder Indiegogo weitergereicht. Paypal bestätigt uns lediglich den
Zahlungseingang. <b>Keine Kreditkarte?</b>
Bitte einfach den nächsten Punkt lesen!</p><br/>
<p></p>
<h4><b>Kann
ich euer tolles Projekt auch ohne Kreditkarte oder PayPal unterstützen?</b></h4>
<p>Falls Du keine Kreditkarte besitzt und
/oder uns lieber per Überweisung unterstützen möchtest, kannst Du den
Wunschbetrag gerne an folgendes Konto überweisen: nandita / Reisen &amp; Live-Reportagen OG, Wehrgrabengasse 85b/1, 4400 Steyr. IBAN: AT191511000921181350, BIC: OBKLAT2L<br/></p>
<p>Bitte vergiss nicht, uns Deinen Namen,
Deine E-Mail Adresse und das gewünschte Dankeschön mitzuteilen. Wir werden Deinen
Betrag dann „manuell“ bei Indiegogo einpflegen und, falls von dir gewünscht,

On a Solar-Powered E-Tandem to Kazakhstan – become part of TEAM AUSTRIA!</h2><br/>E-Bikes are boring and only fun for granny and grandpa? Nonsense! This summer, we will prove the opposite! We will be participating at <b>“The Sun Trip”</b> Solar-Bicycle race and ride a specially designed E-Bike tandem from Italy to Kazakhstan. We want to show that E-motor assistance can be real fun and gonna have a unique, crazy adventure – and YOU can be a part of it!<br/><br/>The Sun Trip is no “normal” E-Bike adventure. The challenge is to ride 8.000 kilometres with SOLAR-POWERED E-Bikes! The design and realization of the bike has to be tackled by the teams themselves. The international field of participants, consisting of 23 teams, has to generate the whole energy-demand during the 2 ½ months trip exclusively with solar power!<br/><br/><ul>
<li>8.000 Kilometres</li>
<li>23 teams, 14 nations</li>
<li>On their own, no backup-team</li>
<li>Constantly fighting against the elements</li>
<li>Only supported by the sun</li>
</ul><br/>As Team Austria, we will be the first and only German-speaking participants at The Sun Trip. We want to show the endless possibilities of alternative energy sources and E-Mobility. In short: The Sun Trip 2015 – a unique, sustainable adventure!
<br/><br/>**UPDATE**
<br/><i>Due to the rejection of an essential sponsor, the organizers of The Sun Trip had to massively change the whole architecture of the race: Officially, the route will go from Italy to Turkey and via the Balkans back to Italy. For us and three other teams, this decision was a big disappointment … After constructive discussions with the organizers we and the other three teams will keep the original Sun Trip route alive and continue as “Sun Trip Solar Ambassadors” to Kazakhstan.</i><br/><br/>It´s not only about the participation at The Sun Trip: Since we had a lot of success with our Live-Documentary (live-photo- and video presentation) “Tailwind – on bicycles around the world”, we want to produce a new presentation about this crazy adventure! We want to take you with us! With a lot of tailwind and humour – passing breath-taking landscapes, vibrant cities, smiling faces. Through rain, wind and sunshine – until we finally reach the shimmering heat of the endless Kazakh steppe. According to our motto:<br/><br/><b>Get out of the comfort zone – hop on your bike!</b><br/><br/><br/><h2>Goals, target group</h2><br/>With the Live-Presentations about our world-cycle adventure, we could inspire so many people – and could bring a few of them to change something in their lives! This makes us very happy and motivates us to continue our way!<br/><br/>We are more than convinced that our solar-vehicle will attract a lot of attention during the trip. For sure we will be having many exiting encounters and meeting inspiring people. Exactly these moments we will capture and share with you in our new Live-Documentary!<br/><br/>After visiting our presentation, you should wear a big smile on your face. You shall be full of energy and inspiration. You will feel the desire to discover our wonderful planet and start your own big (E-Bike) adventure right now!

</div>","*** for English Summary pls scroll down (after the FAQ) ***© SUN TRIP 2013E-Bikes sind langweilig und nur was
für Oma und Opa? Von wegen! Denn diesen Sommer werden wir im Zuge des Sun Trip 2015 mit einem E-Bike bis Kasachstan radeln und damit
beweisen, dass man auch mit „Hilfsmotor“ außergewöhnliche Abenteuer erleben und
richtig Spaß haben kann – und DU
kannst ein Teil davon sein!Der Sun Trip ist jedoch kein
gewöhnliches E-Bike Abenteuer! Es geht darum, eine etwa 8.000 Kilometer lange Reise mit solarbetriebenen E-Bikes zu bewältigen. Die Entwicklung der Solar E-Bikes erfolgt durch die Teilnehmer selbst. Das
internationale Starterfeld, bestehend aus 23 Teams, muss den gesamten
Strombedarf während der etwa 2 ½ Monate
langen Reise ausschließlich mit
Sonnenenergie abdecken!
8.000 Kilometer
23 Teams, 14 Nationen
Auf eigene Faust, ohne Backup-Teams
Im ständigen Kampf gegen die Elemente
Only supported by the sun
Als „Team Austria“ sind wir als erstes deutschsprachiges Gespann mit
dabei und werden zeigen, wie vielseitig Sonnenenergie und Elektromobilität
heute eingesetzt werden können. Kurz gesagt: Der Sun Trip 2015  - ein
abgefahrenes Abenteuer mit hohem Nachhaltigkeitsfaktor!**UPDATE**Aufgrund des Wegfalls eines
 essenziellen Hauptsponsors der Organisatoren, kam es
 leider zu einer massiven Änderung des gesamten 
Rennkonzepts: Offiziell führt die Strecke nun von Italien in die
 Türkei und über den Balkan wieder zurück an den Ausgangspunkt. Für uns und einige andere Teams war diese Entscheidung eine bittere Enttäuschung … Nach Absprache mit der Organisation werden wir die Reise nun trotz der Änderungen
 gemeinsam mit drei anderen Teams als „SUN TRIP Solar Ambassadors“ bis 
nach Kasachstan fortsetzen und somit die Ursprungsidee am Leben 
erhalten!Aber nicht nur um die Teilnahme am Sun
Trip geht es uns: Nach dem Erfolg mit unserer zweifach prämierten Live-Reportage (Vortrag) „Rückenwind – mit dem Rad um die Welt“ soll
eine neue Live-Reportage über diesen irrwitzigen
Roadtrip entstehen. Wir nehmen Euch mit Rückenwind und viel Humor mit
auf ein neues Abenteuer. Vorbei an atemberaubenden Landschaften, pulsierenden
Städten, lachenden Gesichtern. Bei Regen, Wind und Sonnenschein, durch dick und
dünn – bis tief hinein in die flirrende Hitze der unendlichen kasachischen
Steppe. Frei nach unserem wohlbekannten Motto:
Raus
aus der Tretmühle – rauf auf den Drahtesel!

Schon mit unserer
Radweltreise-Reportage haben wir viele Menschen inspiriert und begeistert – und
einige sogar dazu bewegt, etwas in ihrem Leben zu ändern! Das macht uns richtig glücklich – und genau dort wollen wir anknüpfen.Wir sind überzeugt, dass unser
ungewöhnliches Solar-Gespann auf dem Weg nach Kasachstan viel Aufmerksamkeit
erregen wird und uns dadurch wieder viele spannende Begegnungen sicher sind. Diese Momente werden wir einfangen und mit Dir in unserer neuen Live-Reportage
teilen!

Unser Ziel ist es, dass Du nach
unserem Vortrag mit einem breiten Grinsen im Gesicht und voller Inspiration aus
dem Saal marschierst. Du sollst das Verlangen verspüren, dich sofort auf Dein
eigenes (E-)Bike zu schwingen um die Welt zu entdecken … und das Gefühl haben,
dass all unsere Möglichkeiten schier grenzenlos sind!
Unsere Zielgruppe ist bunt durchgemischt: abenteuerlustige Youngsters und
sportbegeisterte Menschen.
Enthusiastische Radfahrer – egal ob Mountainbiker, Renn- oder Reiseradler.
„Ganz normale“ Leute, die selbst nie auf die Idee kommen würden so etwas
Verrücktes zu machen. Sinnsuchende, die Inspirationen für alternative Lebenskonzepte suchen … Eines können wir versprechen: Bei uns wird JEDER auf seine Kosten kommen!


Wir
lieben Radfahren,
sind von der Idee und dem nachhaltigen
Konzept des Sun Trip fasziniert und können es kaum erwarten endlich
loszufahren! Mindestens genauso viel Freude macht uns der Gedanke, danach eine neue Live-Reportage zu produzieren und Dich damit
nach Kasachstan mitzuehmen!
Die Finanzierung unserer Teilnahme am
Sun Trip, und vor allem die Entwicklung und Umsetzung unseres
Solar-E-Tandems, geht jedoch über unsere derzeitigen finanziellen
Möglichkeiten hinaus.Mit Deiner Unterstützung ist es uns möglich, das Projekt auf hohem, professionellen Niveau durchzuführen
und Dir danach einen unvergesslichen
Vortragsabend zu bescheren!Falls Du an uns glaubst und ebenso fasziniert bist vom Sun Trip wie wir, unterstütze uns und werde ein Teil des
„Team Austria“!
Zu unserer Suntrip-Website geht´s
hier: http://suntrip.nandita.at/

Die Einnahmen aus dieser Kampagne
werden zwar nicht das gesamte Vorhaben finanzieren, uns aber trotzdem enorm
helfen, unsere Idee umzusetzen!


Ein
erheblicher Teil des Geldes fließt in die professionelle
Entwicklung und Umsetzung unseres Solar-E-Tandems. Das Bike wird mit einem
leichten Solar-Dach mit zwei monokristallinen Dünnschichtpaneelen ausgestattet,
welche die Energie zum Laden unserer Akkus liefern werden.


Ein
weiterer Teil des Budgets fließt in die Produktion
der Dankeschöns, die Du als Gegenleistung für Deine finanzielle Unterstützung
erhältst - wie zum Beispiel  das stylishe ""Team Austria SUPPORTER TRIKOT"" in bewährter Löffler-Qualität!


Etwas Geld
wird auch für die Durchführung der
Crowdfunding-Kampagne selbst benötigt: die Produktion des
Vorstellungs-Videos, Transaktions- und Plattformgebühren, Werbung etc …

Unsere Crowdfunding-Kampagne läuft 40 Tage und endet am 29. Mai 2015. Wenn Ihr unser Projekt toll findet dann erzählt all Euren Freunden, Familien und Arbeitskollegen davon! Teilt die Kampagne via Social-Media
(Facebook, Twitter & Co). Schreibt
in Eurem Blog darüber, schickt E-Mails an Eure Kontakte und helft uns, so viele
Menschen wie möglich zu erreichen! Denn nur
gemeinsam können wir es schaffen! DANKE!!
nandita – Anita Burgholzer & Andreas Hübl –
aus Steyr, Oberösterreich. Ein „ganz
gewöhnliches“ Reiseradlerpaar mit oftmals verrückten Ideen. „Frau nandita“
ist 34 Jahre alt, „Herr nandita“ zählt 39 Lenze. Seit dreizehn
Jahren ein Paar, das immer schon gerne loszog, um die Welt hautnah zu entdecken.Die gemeinsame Passion von Anita & Andreas ist das Reisen mit dem Fahrrad. Was 2007 mit
einer vierwöchigen „Probetour“ durch den Jemen begann, fand zwischen Mai 2010
und September 2012 seinen Höhepunkt: Eine Fahrradweltreise,
die sie und ihre Drahtesel in 844 Tagen auf knapp 36.500 Kilometer durch drei
Kontinente und 35 Länder bringen sollte. Dieser einzigartige Roadtrip prägte
das Leben der beiden nachhaltig, es war ihr Einstieg in die professionelle Vortragsreferenten-Szene.Mit ihrer zweifach prämierten
Live-Reportage „Rückenwind – Mit dem Rad um die Welt“ touren Anita &
Andreas seit Herbst 2013 sehr erfolgreich durch Österreich und Deutschland. Das gleichnamige Buch  erschien mittlerweile in der 3.
Auflage. Regelmäßige Veröffentlichungen in renommierten Tageszeitungen und
Magazinen (SportAktiv, Sonntags-Krone, Salzburger Nachrichten, OÖN, RAUS! …),
sowie Auftritte in Radio und TV (Ö1, ORF2, div. Regionale Radiosender) „runden“
das Portfolio ab.
Anita
Burgholzer, geboren 1980.
Ganz im Ernst aber auch für jeden Spaß zu haben.  “Kreativer” Part von nandita und auch der
weibliche. Anita hat ihr kreatives Händchen in renommierten Werbeagenturen
bewiesen und ist seit einigen Jahren als Grafikdesignerin selbstständig. Nebenbei
tourt sie gemeinsam mit Andreas als Vortragsreferentin durch Österreich und
Deutschland. Sie liebt die Natur und isst für ihr Leben
gerne Pommes.


Andreas
Hübl, geboren 1976.
Männlich, schnell, Kilometerfräse. Zuständig für Organisation, Presse &
Technik. Andreas hat nach mehrjähriger Wirtschaftstätigkeit seinem Dasein als
Einkäufer Lebewohl gesagt. Im Sommer arbeitet  er als Mountainbike-Guide, im Winter hält er gemeinsam mit Anita Vorträge,
kümmert sich um die Vermarktung des Buchs und tüftelt an neuen Projekten. Er
hat die unglaubliche Fähigkeit, trotz seines geringen Kampfgewichts von 69 Kilo
Unmengen an Essbarem in sich hineinzustopfen.
Was
ist Crowdfunding?
Die genaue Übersetzung würde
„Schwarmfinanzierung“ heißen. Statt eines einzelnen Geldgebers tragen viele zur
Finanzierung eines Projekts oder Produkts bei: die Crowd, eine Masse von
Leuten. Der Unterschied zu einer normalen Spendenaktion ist aber, dass Du eine Gegenleistung für Deinen Beitrag
bekommst. Du bezahlst sozusagen per Vorauskassa für ein Dankeschön Deiner Wahl
– und das finden wir super!
Wie
funktioniert der Spendenprozess?
Das Spenden ist in 3 einfache Schritte gegliedert. Zuerst
wählst Du auf der Hauptseite unserer Kampagne Dein Dankeschön (im Fachjargon
heißt das „Perk“) aus. In Schritt 1
hast Du die (optionale) Möglichkeit, einen zusätzlichen Betrag als Geschenk
festzulegen. Darunter kannst Du ein Häkchen setzen, wenn Dein Name nicht auf
der Kampagnenseite gezeigt werden soll. Unterhalb des Pflichtfelds für eine
E-Mail Adresse gibst Du Deine Adresse an, an die wir nach erfolgreicher
Kampagne Dein Dankeschön versenden werden. In Schritt 2 geht’s zur Bezahlung via Paypal bzw. Kreditkarte und in Schritt 3 hast Du die Möglichkeit,
unsere Kampagne via Facebook etc. zu teilen.Wie
funktioniert der Bezahlprozess?
Bei Indiegogo gibt es nur die
Möglichkeit, mit Paypal oder Kreditkarte
zu bezahlen. Auch Kreditkartenzahlungen werden von Paypal abgewickelt, einen
Account bei Paypal brauchst Du dafür aber nicht. Das heißt: Am Ende des
Spendenprozesses kannst Du dich entweder bei Paypal einloggen oder direkt Deine
Kreditkartennummer eingeben. Diese Daten bekommt nur Paypal, sie werden nicht
an uns oder Indiegogo weitergereicht. Paypal bestätigt uns lediglich den
Zahlungseingang. Keine Kreditkarte?
Bitte einfach den nächsten Punkt lesen!

Kann
ich euer tolles Projekt auch ohne Kreditkarte oder PayPal unterstützen?
Falls Du keine Kreditkarte besitzt und
/oder uns lieber per Überweisung unterstützen möchtest, kannst Du den
Wunschbetrag gerne an folgendes Konto überweisen: nandita / Reisen & Live-Reportagen OG, Wehrgrabengasse 85b/1, 4400 Steyr. IBAN: AT191511000921181350, BIC: OBKLAT2L
Bitte vergiss nicht, uns Deinen Namen,
Deine E-Mail Adresse und das gewünschte Dankeschön mitzuteilen. Wir werden Deinen
Betrag dann „manuell“ bei Indiegogo einpflegen und, falls von dir gewünscht,
dich in der Unterstützer-Liste eintragen.

Wie
sicher sind meine Daten?
Die Verbindung mit Indiegogo ist
verschlüsselt, ebenso die Verbindung zu Paypal. Du kannst einstellen, welche
Daten über Deine Spende öffentlich angezeigt werden sollen.***************************   ENGLISH SUMMARY   **************************


On a Solar-Powered E-Tandem to Kazakhstan – become part of TEAM AUSTRIA!E-Bikes are boring and only fun for granny and grandpa? Nonsense! This summer, we will prove the opposite! We will be participating at “The Sun Trip” Solar-Bicycle race and ride a specially designed E-Bike tandem from Italy to Kazakhstan. We want to show that E-motor assistance can be real fun and gonna have a unique, crazy adventure – and YOU can be a part of it!The Sun Trip is no “normal” E-Bike adventure. The challenge is to ride 8.000 kilometres with SOLAR-POWERED E-Bikes! The design and realization of the bike has to be tackled by the teams themselves. The international field of participants, consisting of 23 teams, has to generate the whole energy-demand during the 2 ½ months trip exclusively with solar power!
8.000 Kilometres
23 teams, 14 nations
On their own, no backup-team
Constantly fighting against the elements
Only supported by the sun
As Team Austria, we will be the first and only German-speaking participants at The Sun Trip. We want to show the endless possibilities of alternative energy sources and E-Mobility. In short: The Sun Trip 2015 – a unique, sustainable adventure!
**UPDATE**
Due to the rejection of an essential sponsor, the organizers of The Sun Trip had to massively change the whole architecture of the race: Officially, the route will go from Italy to Turkey and via the Balkans back to Italy. For us and three other teams, this decision was a big disappointment … After constructive discussions with the organizers we and the other three teams will keep the original Sun Trip route alive and continue as “Sun Trip Solar Ambassadors” to Kazakhstan.It´s not only about the participation at The Sun Trip: Since we had a lot of success with our Live-Documentary (live-photo- and video presentation) “Tailwind – on bicycles around the world”, we want to produce a new presentation about this crazy adventure! We want to take you with us! With a lot of tailwind and humour – passing breath-taking landscapes, vibrant cities, smiling faces. Through rain, wind and sunshine – until we finally reach the shimmering heat of the endless Kazakh steppe. According to our motto:Get out of the comfort zone – hop on your bike!Goals, target groupWith the Live-Presentations about our world-cycle adventure, we could inspire so many people – and could bring a few of them to change something in their lives! This makes us very happy and motivates us to continue our way!We are more than convinced that our solar-vehicle will attract a lot of attention during the trip. For sure we will be having many exiting encounters and meeting inspiring people. Exactly these moments we will capture and share with you in our new Live-Documentary!After visiting our presentation, you should wear a big smile on your face. You shall be full of energy and inspiration. You will feel the desire to discover our wonderful planet and start your own big (E-Bike) adventure right now! You will feel that all our possibilities are unlimited!Our target group is hard to define: adventurous youngsters and enthusiastic sportsmen. All kinds of cyclists – no matter if they are mountainbikers, road- or travel cyclists. “Normal” people who would not even think about cycling 8.000 kilometres to Kazakhstan – on a solar-powered tandem!  People in quest for meaning, looking for alternative concepts of living … There´s one thing we can promise: Anyone visiting our Live-Documentary will have a great time!Why should I support your project?We love cycling, are more than convinced of the sustainable concept of The Sun Trip and we can´t wait to hit the road!

This makes a flexible grill that can be rolled up. To make the grill a strong solid surface, there are two steel rods that connect to the grill and follow the length of the steel wires on each side of the grill. The grill connects in to the holes on top of the frame to make one solid structure. We have tested the grill and the frame up to 10kg without any problems.Roasting spitThe roasting spit makes the outdoor cooking experience complete! The spit is made specially for the Firekorf. It is also designed to compact and lightweight. The spit itself is made out of 3 parts that screw together into one long spit. This spit fits on the Firekorf with 2 brackets that screw into the legs of the Firekorf.On the point side, the spit and its bracket are round so it can turn easy. On the side of the handle the rod of the spit and the bracket are square which makes it possible to lock it in place so the spit can't turn further of back.Specs and materialsCompact storing All parts of the Firekorf and its features  are designed so that they can be folded, rolled up or screwed together. Although it is large, it can be packed very compact.Every part has its on place in the roll-up cover bag. This cover bag is specially design for the firekorf and makes it very easy and compact to store or carry. Even if your are not planning to take all the accessories with you. Durabel materials All the parts and features of the Firekorf are made out of 304 stainless steel. Except for the handle of the spit which is made out of walnut wood. This makes it a high quality and durable product.  The 304 stainless steel is food save and easy to clean and maintain.  Weight and dimensions",14.0,0,"3 Campaigns

The 2 buttons located on the right of the device allow you to have access to the following information during your dive: Up button: compass - Down button: maximum depth, temperature, depth.</p><p><strong>Does Māoï adapt to all types of vision?</strong> Māoï is very easy to read for divers, with or without a vision problem. It is particularly adapted to the problems of presbyopia and associates perfectly with the corrective lenses which a diver can have on his mask or with the lenses of contact.</p><p><strong>Which decompression model do you use?</strong> We implemented a Bulhman model ZHL-16C with 3 levels of gradient factors so that the diver can adapt the computer to his state of health. Our computer has been tested by an external certification body. This test includes the verification of decompression protocols recommended by Māoï for recreational diving profiles.</p><p><strong>Does Māoï remember the history of my dives?</strong> Yes, Māoï keeps in memory your last 100 dives.</p><p><strong>Can I transfer my dive data?</strong> Yes, you can transfer your data to divelog.de dive software</p><p><strong>How do I charge Māoï?</strong> Māoï comes with an usb cable that you can plug into the port to charge it.</p><p><strong>What are the risk and challenges?</strong> We are far in the process of moving from prototype to production. We already produced serveral functional prototypes. Today we are confident with our product timeline, however we will let all backers know if any unexpected changes come up.</p><p><strong>I do not find the answer to my question, what can I do?</strong> Feel free do drop us a line at <a href=""mailto:hello@thalatoo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hello@thalatoo.com</a>  We will be happy to answer all your questions.</p><p> </p><p><a name=""francais"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a></p><h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511775808/h5isuuyqvgyclftld8ji.png"" src=""""/></h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512127220/f5qgngg07igvo4fnlrle.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512054957/eztfgo3so2sehluwytdp.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong>Centraliser toutes les données vitales de plongée </strong>à un seul endroit,  afin qu’elles soient visibles en un clin d’œil et<strong> au bon moment,</strong> c’est le défi que nous avons relevé.</p><p>Māoï a été conçu pour devenir un véritable <strong>assistant de plongée</strong>, qui permet aux plongeurs de se <strong>focaliser sur l’essentiel</strong> : leur propre expérience de plongée.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512123206/ktofcsfripq3libsl296.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511775907/e3egmj9wnxewoojspope.png"" src=""""/></p><h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511866264/xmvs8cqkys3iznlgr0n8.jpg"" src=""""/></h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511775922/czwzfmdt7nekbgcrymc1.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Grâce à un système optique breveté, <strong>vos données de plongée sont projetées à 2 mètres devant vos yeux</strong>.

Without any effort and without disrupting your underwater exploration, you have access to your vital information when you need them. Māoï detects your dive phases and adapts its display accordingly. The depth and diving time are displayed throughout your dive, the ascent time during the exploration phase, the ascending speed and decompression stop are displayed when you go back up.... The information you need will only be displayed when you need it.  (Check below some examples of the context-sensitive display)Māoï has a front-facing screen entirely dedicated to your buddy. It displays real time information to your teammate, visible at all times, allowing you and your buddy to enjoy a safety dive. (Check below some examples of the buddy display)Māoï integrates a Bühlmann ZHL-16C algorithm with gradient factors. Our decompression models are being validated by an expert and independent certifying body. Māoï allows you to manage the stages of decompression, considering the number of dives made during the day. It calculates the NoDec time, the decompression stops, the no fly time... Māoï is compatible with any type of visual correction (either on your mask or eyes) and fits with presbyopia. The brightness of the display adapts to your environment and you will not lose any crumb of your dive, Māoï knows how to be discreet. Get in a snap on your course. With Māoï you will love to steer yourself under water! November 2017, DEMA Show, Orlando (Scuba diving industry fair-trade). Out of water trials of Māoï's prototypes.

Today we are at the pre-production stage and we are on INDIEGOGO to raise the necessary funds to launch our production. We are convinced that our innovation will revolutionize your dive experience. Help us to make this adventure possible! 
Make the information accessible to the diver in a simple way, at the right time, while allowing him to make the most of his dive, is the guideline of the Thalatoo team.
We bring together our experience, passion and hard work to create a product we are truly proud of and will improve your dive experience.

The idea of Māoï came right after a dive in Corsica (France) in June 2015.Boris, too busy checking his diving information on his wrist dive computer on a decompression stop, misses a magnificent Barracuda. In September 2016 with Emmanuel, a long-time friend and colleague, they created Thalatoo with the aim to produce innovative diving equipment that is accessible to all, easy to use and allow divers to make the most of their dives safely. Since June 2015, we have come a long way and we have lifted all the technical locks to bring this innovative product to life.For over a year we focused our efforts on research and development. Our major challenge was to find a way to bring up readable information under water in front of the diver's eyes. We have identified several solutions to build our optical system, we have eliminated many because of their size and complexity. Some optics specialists have tried to discourage us by saying that the technical solution we were looking for would not work. But we kept on searching to find the right solution and our efforts paid off !How does it work ? A mini-projector sends the information on the optical reflector, which reflects the light, enlarges the image and projects it in front of the eyes of the diver.The development of our prototypes allowed us to test the readability of the information and to make the necessary adjustments. Our optical system is at the heart of our project, today our architecture is fully validated and 100% reliable. Today we managed to develop fully functional prototypes, tested and improved with the help of hundreds of divers.  Māoï has been designed by divers and for divers.Throughout the product development we worked together with European and American divers. They've tested our prototypes during trials sessions and we've collected a lot of feedbacks from them to improve MĀOÏ's features.Photos from the workshop session in ""Plongée Passion Frontignan"" dive center, October. Here is the mock up design of Māoï : fully engineered on the inside, beautiful and ergonomic from the outside. 

 
What are the accessories delivered with Māoï? In addition to your Māoï dive computer, you will receive the Māoï fixation system, a charger and USB cable to charge your computer and download your dive logbook.Where will Māoï be produced? Māoï will be entirely produced and assembled in France. We rigorously selected our service providers to develop a reliable product with irreproachable quality.Where do you ship? All over the world, shipping costs vary depending on your country of residence (from 15€ to 70€ for one Māoï depending how far you live, delivery costs are displayed in the order module as soon as you specify your country).Is Māoï guaranteed? The legal guarantee of conformity applies for 2 years from the product delivery date. The guarantee applies in the following cases:- The product does not conform to the description and / or does not have the agreed qualities- The product is unsuitable for use- The product has a manufacturing defectIs there already a functioning product?  We developed fully fonctional prototypes, tested and improved with the help of hundred of divers. They work perfectly , even if  they don't have the final design. Thanks to the funds we'll raise on indiegogo we'll be able to go a step further and launch the production integrating the final design.Will Māoï interfere with my field of vision? The optical reflector on which the information is sent, is completely transparent, it does not reduce or interfere with the diver's field of vision.Do I have to change my dive mask? No, you would not have to change your mask. Māoï is an add-on device that you can fix directly above your mask current mask.How is the information displayed during the dive? The contextual display allows Māoï to display the information in an intelligent way. Māoï detects your dive phases and adapts its display accordingly: the depth and duration of the dive are displayed throughout your dive, the ascent time during the exploration phase, the ascent rate and the decompression stop are displayed when you ... The 2 buttons located on the right of the device allow you to have access to the following information during your dive: Up button: compass - Down button: maximum depth, temperature, depth.Does Māoï adapt to all types of vision? Māoï is very easy to read for divers, with or without a vision problem. It is particularly adapted to the problems of presbyopia and associates perfectly with the corrective lenses which a diver can have on his mask or with the lenses of contact.Which decompression model do you use? We implemented a Bulhman model ZHL-16C with 3 levels of gradient factors so that the diver can adapt the computer to his state of health. Our computer has been tested by an external certification body. This test includes the verification of decompression protocols recommended by Māoï for recreational diving profiles.Does Māoï remember the history of my dives? Yes, Māoï keeps in memory your last 100 dives.Can I transfer my dive data? Yes, you can transfer your data to divelog.de dive softwareHow do I charge Māoï? Māoï comes with an usb cable that you can plug into the port to charge it.What are the risk and challenges? We are far in the process of moving from prototype to production. We already produced serveral functional prototypes. Today we are confident with our product timeline, however we will let all backers know if any unexpected changes come up.I do not find the answer to my question, what can I do? Feel free do drop us a line at hello@thalatoo.com  We will be happy to answer all your questions.   Centraliser toutes les données vitales de plongée à un seul endroit,  afin qu’elles soient visibles en un clin d’œil et au bon moment, c’est le défi que nous avons relevé.Māoï a été conçu pour devenir un véritable assistant de plongée, qui permet aux plongeurs de se focaliser sur l’essentiel : leur propre expérience de plongée.Grâce à un système optique breveté, vos données de plongée sont projetées à 2 mètres devant vos yeux. Sans aucun effort et sans perturber l'exploration des fonds sous-marin, vous avez accès à ces informations vitales dès que vous en avez besoin. Māoï détecte vos phases de plongée et adapte son affichage en conséquence : la profondeur et la durée de la plongée sont affichées tout au long de votre plongée, le temps de remontée pendant la phase d'exploration, la vitesse de remontée et les stop de décompression  sont affichés lorsque vous remontez La vitesse remontée s’affiche lorsque vous remontez… L’information est visible quand elle est nécessaire.(Regardez ci-dessous quelques exemples d'affichages.)Māoï dispose un écran tourné vers l'avant entièrement dédié à votre binôme.  Les informations principales de votre coéquipier sont affichées sur l'écran et sont visibles à tout moment, et vous permettent de pratiquer votre loisir préféré en toute sécurité (Regardez ci-dessous quelques exemples d'affichage de l'écran binôme.)Māoï intègre un algorithme Bühlmann ZHL-16C avec gradient factors dont les protocoles de décompression sont en cours de validation par un organisme certificateur expert et indépendant. Māoï permet donc de gérer les phases de décompression en calculant le NoDec time, les informations de paliers, le no fly time…Māoï est compatible avec tout type de correction visuelle et convient parfaitement aux presbytes. L'intensité lumineuse s'adapte à votre environnement et vous ne perdrez aucune miette de votre plongée, Māoï sait se faire discret.   Accédez en un clin d'œil à votre cap. Avec Māoï vous allez adorer vous orienter sous l'eau !   Novembre 2017, DEMA Show, Orlando (Salon mondial de la plongée). Regardez les réactions des plongeurs lorsqu'ils testent les prototypes de Māoï ! :-)

Aujourd'hui, nous sommes au stade de la pré-production. Nous sommes donc sur INDIEGOGO pour lever les fonds nécessaires au lancement de la production de Māoï. Nous sommes convaincus que notre innovation révolutionnera votre plongée. Aidez-nous à faire de cette aventure un véritable succès, accessible à tous ! Rendre l’information accessible à l’utilisateur de façon simple, au bon moment, tout en lui permettant de profiter au maximum de sa plongée est la ligne directrice des équipes de Thalatoo.Nous mobilisons notre expérience, notre passion et notre travail pour créer un produit dont nous sommes vraiment fiers et qui améliorera considérablement votre expérience lors de vos plongées.L'idée de Māoï est née juste après une plongée en Corse, en juin 2015.Boris, trop affairé à vérifier ses informations sur sa montre-ordinateur de plongée a manqué le passage d'un magnifique Barracuda durant un palier de décompression. En septembre 2016, Boris créée alors avec Emmanuel, un ami et collègue de longue-date, la société Thalatoo. Les deux amis sont guidés par la volonté de produire des équipements de plongée innovants, accessibles au plus grand nombre et facile à utiliser. L'idée ? Les plongeurs doivent profiter au maximum de leur plongée, en toute sécurité. Nous avons parcouru un long chemin depuis la naissance de l'idée de Māoï. Nous avons levé tous les verrous techniques pour donner vie à ce produit innovant.Pendant plus d'un an nous avons concentré nos efforts sur la recherche et développement. Notre défi majeur était de trouver le moyen de faire apparaître des informations lisibles sous l'eau, devant les yeux du plongeur.  Nous avons identifié plusieurs solutions pour construire notre système optique, nous en avons éliminé un grand nombre du fait de leur encombrement et complexité. Certains spécialistes de l'optique ont tenté de nous décourager en nous disant que la solution technique que nous recherchions ne fonctionnerait pas. Mais nous ne nous sommes pas découragés et nos efforts ont payé !Comment ça marche ? Un mini-projecteur envoie les informations sur le réflecteur optique, ce dernier réfléchit la lumière, agrandit l’image et la projette devant les yeux du plongeur. Le développement de nos prototypes nous a permis de tester et faire tester la lisibilité des informations pour apporter les ajustements nécessaires.Notre système optique est au cœur de notre projet, aujourd'hui notre architecture est complètement validée et 100% fiable. Aujourd'hui, nous développons des prototypes totalement fonctionnels, testés et améliorés avec l'aide de centaines de plongeurs volontaires. Māoï a été conçu par et pour les plongeurs.Nous avons co-développé le produit ensemble, avec des plongeurs européens et américains. Ces-derniers ont testé nos prototypes en plongée, au cours de séances de co-développement. Ainsi, nous avons pu améliorer les fonctionnalités de Māoï grâce à leurs nombreuses remarques et suggestions.Photos prises lors d'une séance hébergée par ""Plongée Passion Frontignan"", Octobre. Voici ci-dessous la maquette finale du produit fini de Māoï : ingénieux à l'intérieur, magnifique et ergonomique à l'extérieur !

 
  Quels sont les accessoires livrés avec Māoï ? En plus de votre ordinateur de plongée Māoï, vous recevrez le système de fixation pour positionner Māoï au-dessus de votre masque, un chargeur et câble USB pour charger votre ordinateur et télécharger l'historique de vos plongées.Où livrez-vous ? Partout dans le monde, les frais de livraison sont variables selon votre pays résidence (entre 15€ et 70€ pour 1 Māoï selon votre éloignement, les frais de livraison seront précisés dans le module de commande).Où sera produit Māoï ? Māoï sera entièrement produit et assemblé en France. Nous avons rigoureusement sélectionné nos prestataires pour développer un produit fiable avec une qualité irréprochable.Est-ce que Māoï est garanti ? La garantie légale de conformité est appliquée pendant une période de 2 ans à compter de la date de réception du produit. La garantie s’applique dans les cas suivants :
Le produit n’est pas conforme à la description et/ou n’a pas les qualités convenues
Le produit est impropre à l’usage
Le produit présente un défaut de fabrication
 Avez-vous déjà des produits fonctionnels ? Nous avons développé des prototypes 100% fonctionnels, qui ont été testés et améliorés à l'aide de la communauté de plongeurs. Ils intègrent l'ensemble des fonctionnalités de Māoï. Le boitier avec le design définitif n'a pas encore été produit. Les fonds récoltés lors de notre campagne de financement participatif nous permettrons d'acheter les moules pour fabriquer le boîtier et de donner vie à Māoï avec son nouveau design.Est-ce que Māoï va gêner mon champ de vision ? Le réflecteur optique sur lequel les informations sont envoyées est complètement transparent, il ne réduit pas et ne gênera pas le champ de vision du plongeur.Est- ce que je dois changer de masque de plongée ? Non, nous avons développé Māoï pour qu'il s'adapte à tous les masques de plongée. Māoï se positionne au-dessus de votre masque, vous pouvez conserver votre masque habituel.Comment est géré l'affichage des informations lors de la plongée ?  L'affichage contextuel permet à Māoï d'afficher les informations de manière intelligente. Māoï détecte vos phases de plongée et adapte son affichage en conséquence :  la profondeur et la durée de la plongée sont affichés tout au long de votre plongée, le temps de remontée pendant la phase d'exploration, la vitesse de remontée et les stop de décompression sont affichés lorsque vous... Les 2 boutons situés sur la droite de l'appareil vous permettent d'avoir accès aux informations suivantes lors de votre plongée : Bouton haut : compas - Bouton bas : profondeur maximum, température, profondeur.Est-ce que Māoï s'adapte à toutes les types de vues ? Māoï est très facile à lire pour les plongeurs, ayant ou non un problème de vision.  Il est particulièrement adapté aux problèmes de presbytie et s'associe parfaitement avec les verres correcteurs qu'un plongeur peut avoir sur son masque ou avec les lentilles de contact.Quel modèle de décompression utilisez-vous ? Nous avons implémenté un modèle Bulhman ZHL-16C avec 3 niveaux de gradient factors pour que le plongeur puisse adapter l'ordinateur à son état de santé. Notre ordinateur a été testé par un organisme de certification externe. Ce test comprend la vérification des protocoles de décompression préconisé par Māoï pour des profils de plongée loisir.Māoï garde-t-il en mémoire l'historique de mes plongées ? Oui, Māoï garde en mémoire vos 100 dernières plongées.Est-ce que je peux transférer mes données de plongée ?  Oui, vous pouvez transférer vos données vers le logiciel de plongée divelog.de Comment puis-je charger Māoï ? Māoï est livré avec chargeur et câble USB, vous pourrez le charger très facilement.Quels sont les risques et défis ?  Nous sommes à un stade très avancés dans nos développements, et la prochaine étape est de lancer la production. Nous avons déjà produit plusieurs prototypes fonctionnels. Aujourd'hui, nous sommes confiants quant à la suite des développements et le respect de notre planning. Si des changements inattendus venaient à survenir, nous informerons très rapidement tous nos contributeurs. Je ne trouve pas la réponse à ma question, que dois-je faire ? N'hésitez pas à nous écrire à hello@thalatoo.com. Nous serons heureux de répondre à toutes vos questions.",72.0,14,"1 Campaign

<p>Hey everyone, my name is Christian Anderson. I am a photographer and <a href=""http://www.inthecoffeeshop.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">coffee shop blogger</a>; I live in Colorado. What originally started as an idea between myself and 
brothers Tim and Tommy Thwaites (owners of Coda Coffee) 3  years ago grew into a dream trip. Traveling across the country to
 visit coffee shops with the purpose of sharing with everyone fine art 
images and stories from shop owners, managers, baristas, and maybe even a
 patron.<br/></p>
<blockquote><p>“Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn’t do than by the ones you did do.” – Mark Twain<br/></p></blockquote>

<p>Last fall, I decided to move forward in making my dream a reality, 
and nervously purchased a camper trailer. I call her, ""The Green Bean,"" 
and she's everything I need to make the trip - 2003 Toyota Tundra with a
 Phoenix slide-in camper. Then I went out on a limb and 30 coffee shops 
agreed to be part of the adventure; over 9,000 miles across 20 states 
and British Columbia!</p>

<div style=""text-align: justify;"">While I've been able to get the Green Bean just about ready for long-term travel 
and set aside some money to pay for trip expenses, I need to raise 
$8,680.00 in additional funding, in order to complete this project. This
 is the absolute bare minimum that I need, to make this trip a reality.<br/><br/>I've
 always felt encouragement and support for this project, however I now 
need a little help from my friends. This is why I'm asking for your 
contributions, whether it's a dollar or twenty thousand dollars. Anyone 
have $20k? Anything you can provide would be a blessing.<br/><br/>If I'm 
unable to reach my goal, I will still utilize the funds raised and start the adventure. This campaign will help me cover
 the following costs:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>Truck and Camper Trailer - Covered</li>
<li>New Tires - Covered</li>

</div></div>","Hey everyone, my name is Christian Anderson. I am a photographer and coffee shop blogger; I live in Colorado. What originally started as an idea between myself and 
brothers Tim and Tommy Thwaites (owners of Coda Coffee) 3  years ago grew into a dream trip. Traveling across the country to
 visit coffee shops with the purpose of sharing with everyone fine art 
images and stories from shop owners, managers, baristas, and maybe even a
 patron.
“Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn’t do than by the ones you did do.” – Mark Twain



Last fall, I decided to move forward in making my dream a reality, 
and nervously purchased a camper trailer. I call her, ""The Green Bean,"" 
and she's everything I need to make the trip - 2003 Toyota Tundra with a
 Phoenix slide-in camper. Then I went out on a limb and 30 coffee shops 
agreed to be part of the adventure; over 9,000 miles across 20 states 
and British Columbia!

I leave the first week of June, 2016. You can check out the list of coffee shops that I'll be visiting, in the Gallery section.


While I've been able to get the Green Bean just about ready for long-term travel 
and set aside some money to pay for trip expenses, I need to raise 
$8,680.00 in additional funding, in order to complete this project. This
 is the absolute bare minimum that I need, to make this trip a reality.I've
 always felt encouragement and support for this project, however I now 
need a little help from my friends. This is why I'm asking for your 
contributions, whether it's a dollar or twenty thousand dollars. Anyone 
have $20k? Anything you can provide would be a blessing.If I'm 
unable to reach my goal, I will still utilize the funds raised and start the adventure. This campaign will help me cover
 the following costs:
Truck and Camper Trailer - Covered
New Tires - Covered
Generator - Covered
Computer - Covered
Backup Hard Drives - Covered

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Speednite smart stem</i></p>
<p>When riding at night, it’s crucial to have a <strong>clear view of all road conditions</strong>. But typical bike headlights simply point straight ahead without the ability to adjust. Speednite has a powerful <strong>800 lumen front headlight </strong>controlled by a head sensor attached to the helmet. It tracks your head position and automatically adjusts the light beam up or down to the angle that you are looking. By <strong>changing vertical angle by up to 90°</strong> Speednite puts the light beam right where you need it.<br/> </p>
<p>There are <strong>four LED modes</strong> available (Full Light, Half Light, Quick Flash and Slow Flash) for any riding conditions, all conveniently controlled by physical buttons or through the Speednite app.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Be Visible to Other Road Users</strong><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://gallery.mailchimp.com/c825ad9bbdb6151c04fd09ad2/images/c4f82cc4-14ec-402d-96bc-bf436ffb9083.gif"" src="""" style=""margin:auto;""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>A turn signal makes your intention more clearly</i><br/> </p>
<p>Anytime your go for a ride, it's vital to <strong>make yourself visible to other road users</strong>. Accidents most often occur when turning or changing lanes. However, it can be unsafe to use traditional hand signals, which force the rider to remove their hands from the handlebars and are difficult or impossible to see in the dark.<br/> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/027/266/852/d5648a8a8d99f52e28990bd46da3778c_original.gif?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1574164910&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=ae32bc9a19c800e48e9906c46ae0b7a4"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Turn signal &amp; rear light shows the turning direction​</i></p>
<p>Speednite makes your intentions clear with <strong>super bright laser turn signals that shine on the ground</strong> in the direction of your intended turn. The laser indicators can be seen clearly by other cyclists, pedestrians and car drivers.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Speednite is the first lighting system with automated turn signals that are<strong> triggered by the cyclist’s head motion </strong>through a tiny head sensor. The helmet mounted sensor tracks the user’s head movements and shines a warning laser light onto the ground in the direction of the turn. At the same time, the taillight indicates the turning direction with a blinking light for added safety. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Emergency SOS Function</strong><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://gallery.mailchimp.com/c825ad9bbdb6151c04fd09ad2/images/ceee73b0-36df-449d-bb78-868ed36b96e2.gif"" src="""" style=""margin:auto;""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>It can call the emergency contact automatically</i></p>
<p><br/>If the worst does happen, Speenite provides added features for the cyclist’s safety. The head motion sensor can detect unusual motions that are associated with a crash. In that unfortunate event, the <strong>SOS signal lights will be turned on and flash rapidly</strong>. At the same time, the Speenite App will automatically alert a pre-set <strong>emergency contact</strong> for help.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Keeps your Helmet Lightweight</strong><br/> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574136152/ozzjtflmistssqod8m71.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Speednite keeps lightweight and safe</i></p>
<p>Traditional helmet lights point their light beam in the direction the head moves, but they are heavy and add weight to the head in a way that impacts your riding experience. Helmet lights can also break easily during crashes. Speednite keeps your <strong>helmet lightweight</strong> and your headlight on the bike where it belongs. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574062888/s9uat12aqbibhmfyften.png"" src=""""/><br/><br/><strong>Lightweight Head Sensor  </strong><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/027/267/326/6aac8019090a7e8145ed62546d00654c_original.gif?ixlib=rb-2.1.0&amp;w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1574168001&amp;auto=format&amp;gif-q=50&amp;q=92&amp;s=13b79ad0ea7e12601a86fc7526fd0f50"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>It moves across 90 degrees</i></p>
<p><br/>The main safety functions of Speednite are controlled by the <strong>head sensor</strong> including the front headlight and the turn signals. The front headlight moves up or down across 90 degrees in relation to your head position.</p>
<p>When you are ready to make a lane change or make a turn, <strong>a slight movement of the neck </strong>left or right will initiate the laser turn signal, illuminating the road with a bright stripe of light on that side, making your intentions clearer to motorists and other road users.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Remote &amp; Manual Controls</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1574085610/lj6baj3xjgkukxxgzql2.jpg"" src=""""/></strong><br/> </p>
<p>Speednite also has physical buttons for more convenient use. With them, <strong>the angle of the front light can be manually adjusted</strong>, just in case the head sensor is low on battery. There are four LED modes available (Full Light, Half Light, Quick Flash and Slow Flash) that can be controlled by the button/app.</p>
<p>If manual control is preferred, a small remote can be attached on the handlebar and its function works the same way, controlling the angle of the headlight and the LED modes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Smartphone App</strong><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1573803592/cnyqkxgqyg1bfb3g0dt2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><br/>Along with its powerful safety features, there are more detailed functions inside the Speednite app. It acts as a bike computer and shows the <strong>major metrics</strong> for your riding including speed, time and distance and connects with other BLE heart monitor devices. It also allows you to set the configuration for the <strong>vertical movement angle of the front light</strong>, the <strong>turning range </strong>of your head that triggers the right or left signals, and the <strong>sensitivity</strong> of the head sensor. </p>
<p><strong>Speednite App </strong>is able to record and save your riding data for training purposes and its bike computer functions and data can sync to popular riding app <strong>Strava</strong>.</p>

</div></div>","As cycling enthusiasts we love to ride, often times into the evening. But riding at night requires careful preparation to stay safe. A front and rear light is a must but can be expensive and difficult to install. And even with proper bike setup, typical cycling lights still cannot guarantee safety especially when changing lanes and turning. Front light, turn signal, taillight, you name it.That’s why we created Speednite. It can increase safety by 50% compared to traditional headlights. It's a complete, integrated lighting system built into the bike steering stem and includes headlight, taillight, and laser direction turn signals. This complete set of smart lights makes riding at night convenient while increasing visibility to keep you safer.A test video from our Japanese customerRide with a Better View
The light  moves with the head sensor

Speednite smart stem
When riding at night, it’s crucial to have a clear view of all road conditions. But typical bike headlights simply point straight ahead without the ability to adjust. Speednite has a powerful 800 lumen front headlight controlled by a head sensor attached to the helmet. It tracks your head position and automatically adjusts the light beam up or down to the angle that you are looking. By changing vertical angle by up to 90° Speednite puts the light beam right where you need it. 
There are four LED modes available (Full Light, Half Light, Quick Flash and Slow Flash) for any riding conditions, all conveniently controlled by physical buttons or through the Speednite app.
 
Be Visible to Other Road Users
A turn signal makes your intention more clearly 
Anytime your go for a ride, it's vital to make yourself visible to other road users. Accidents most often occur when turning or changing lanes. However, it can be unsafe to use traditional hand signals, which force the rider to remove their hands from the handlebars and are difficult or impossible to see in the dark. 

Turn signal & rear light shows the turning direction​
Speednite makes your intentions clear with super bright laser turn signals that shine on the ground in the direction of your intended turn. The laser indicators can be seen clearly by other cyclists, pedestrians and car drivers.
 
Speednite is the first lighting system with automated turn signals that are triggered by the cyclist’s head motion through a tiny head sensor. The helmet mounted sensor tracks the user’s head movements and shines a warning laser light onto the ground in the direction of the turn. At the same time, the taillight indicates the turning direction with a blinking light for added safety. 
 
Emergency SOS Function
It can call the emergency contact automatically
If the worst does happen, Speenite provides added features for the cyclist’s safety. The head motion sensor can detect unusual motions that are associated with a crash. In that unfortunate event, the SOS signal lights will be turned on and flash rapidly. At the same time, the Speenite App will automatically alert a pre-set emergency contact for help.
 
Keeps your Helmet Lightweight 

Speednite keeps lightweight and safe
Traditional helmet lights point their light beam in the direction the head moves, but they are heavy and add weight to the head in a way that impacts your riding experience. Helmet lights can also break easily during crashes. Speednite keeps your helmet lightweight and your headlight on the bike where it belongs. 
Lightweight Head Sensor  
It moves across 90 degrees
The main safety functions of Speednite are controlled by the head sensor including the front headlight and the turn signals. The front headlight moves up or down across 90 degrees in relation to your head position.
When you are ready to make a lane change or make a turn, a slight movement of the neck left or right will initiate the laser turn signal, illuminating the road with a bright stripe of light on that side, making your intentions clearer to motorists and other road users.
 
Remote & Manual Controls
 
Speednite also has physical buttons for more convenient use. With them, the angle of the front light can be manually adjusted, just in case the head sensor is low on battery. There are four LED modes available (Full Light, Half Light, Quick Flash and Slow Flash) that can be controlled by the button/app.
If manual control is preferred, a small remote can be attached on the handlebar and its function works the same way, controlling the angle of the headlight and the LED modes.
 
Smartphone App
Along with its powerful safety features, there are more detailed functions inside the Speednite app. It acts as a bike computer and shows the major metrics for your riding including speed, time and distance and connects with other BLE heart monitor devices. It also allows you to set the configuration for the vertical movement angle of the front light, the turning range of your head that triggers the right or left signals, and the sensitivity of the head sensor. 
Speednite App is able to record and save your riding data for training purposes and its bike computer functions and data can sync to popular riding app Strava.
 
Automatic Rear LightThe rear light provides added safety with Full Light or Flash Light modes and has an Auto Brake Light function that is triggered when a sudden brake event occurs. 
Bluetooth & AccessoriesWith Bluetooth built-in, Speednite works with other popular third-party BLE tools such as heart rate sensors, speed sensors, cadence sensors, and more. It tracks cycling metrics automatically, including speed, RPM, BPM, heart rate, etc. 
 
Affordable Safety 
At only $129, Speednite is a complete and affordable cycling lighting system and the first to be controlled automatically with a head sensor. Other front headlight and rear taillight combos often costs more than $200 and don’t provide the convenience or control of Speednite. 
Compatible with Most Bikes
The 90mm length of the Speednite stem is perfect for mounting on most bikes. For other bikes, an adapter is available. Speednite is simple to use and easy to install on any bike. 
 
IP65 Weatherproof


 
Speednite has a high level of protection against water and dust so that you can enjoy your cycling no matter if it’s raining or shining. 
3000mAh Built-in Lithium-ion Battery
 
Equipped with a rechargeable Lithium-ion battery, Speednite meets the needs of sport, travel and commuting and a single charge lasts up to 30 hours.



 
 How to Use
The head motion sensor is quite small that can be attached to any helmet.

Designed with a unique hybrid of features that gives you a storage box, shower tank, and changing lid in one modular design.   BeachBox is designed to keep you and your gear clean and organized. It's the ultimate wingman for outdoor enthusiasts.   Perfect for surfers, campers, windsurfers, jet-skiers, fishermen, mountain bikers, trail runners, hikers and beach-going families with sandy kids!    But don't just take our word for it. The highly curated website 'uncrate' featured it as a product of the day.
 

 
And the team at Globo Surf put it through its paces and came up with flattering results. Overall rating 95%!
 

 You decide how you use it! Store all your gear inside so it's ready to grab and go for a day's adventure. Or load it up with essentials before road trips. It can even house up to four shower tanks!  If you like getting dirty, sandy, muddy, or sweaty then BeachBox is for you!    It's perfect after a session of this...   or this...  even this...  and of course after a session of this...  It's completely modular and packs up neatly, ready to grab and use whenever needed.  BeachBox is ideal after a day at the beach. You'll find it especially useful if you have kids that like to get wet and sandy! Use the portable shower tank to give them a warm rinse after a long day in the sand. Also handy for cleaning beach toys and storing your wet gear for the ride home.   Every BeachBox comes with a two gallon, custom-designed, removable and insulated shower tank, and a non-slip changing lid. 


 


 

The manual pump shower tank is easy to use, easy to refill and offers a full and pressurized flow to wash off sand, salt and dirt. 
 

 The insulated cover keeps water temperate, offering a perfect warm rinse after a cold ocean session, early morning hike or mountain bike ride.   The sturdy, non-slip base allows you to stand inside the BeachBox to rinse. Or you can stand on the non-slip changing lid and shower off there.  
 

 
Keep your wetsuit or other gear out of the dirt, mud or sand!   Inside BeachBox has a designated dry area for towels and clothes. The mini storage tubs are there to store all your essentials: sunblock, surf wax, keys, sunglasses, fishing gear, tools, snacks, etc. It's also useful for holding plates and utensils for those camping trips.  Headed to the great outdoors for the weekend?

C'est au Népal qu'elle se lance un défi un peu fou : partir à l'ascension de l'Annapurna Base Camp (Himalaya). Elle n'a aucune expérience particulière, n’est absolument pas ce qu’on peut appeler une « sportive » et ces dix jours d'efforts physiques intenses à 4200m d'altitude dans des conditions hivernales sont un défi personnel qui va changer sa vie pour toujours.</p><p>Elle se découvre un potentiel physique et mental qu'elle ignorait et revient avec une confiance en elle toute neuve et un plan pour la suite de sa vie.</p><p>Elle vit aujourd'hui à New York avec son mari et travaille comme guide randonnée/camping, certifiée par l'Etat de New-York.</p><p>Escape Hiking for Women est le nouveau défi de Manon: offrir à toutes les femmes la possibilité de vivre ce genre d'expérience, de se sentir plus sauvage, plus forte et plus confiante. C'est aussi pourquoi elle a besoin de vous !</p><h3>
<br/><u><strong>Le concept Escape:</strong></u>
</h3><p><br/>Escape est une entreprise créée et pensée par une femme, dédiée aux New-Yorkaises qui ont envie/besoin de:<br/>- Vivre une nouvelle aventure loin de la ville, du stress, du paraître et de leur vie quotidienne<br/>- Se (re)connecter avec la nature <br/>- Partager une expérience inoubliable entre femmes.</p><p>Nous offrons des weekends de randonnée (2 jours-1 nuit minimum pour vraiment déconnecter) en pleine nature pour des groupes de 5 femmes accompagnées d'une guide certifiée.</p><p><br/><strong>Toutes les femmes peuvent bénéficier des bienfaits de la nature, même si elles n’ont jamais fait de randonnée ou de camping. Et elles n'ont pas besoin d'un homme pour les accompagner.</strong></p><p>Le premier week-end Escape est prévu le 24 Juin 2017.</p><h3>
<br/><u><strong>Pourquoi cette campagne de financement?</strong></u>
</h3><p>Nous savons ce que c'est que de vivre à New York. Nous savons combien il est difficile (voir impossible) de planifier une escapade en plein air : que faire si je n'ai pas de matériel de randonnée/camping ? Où puis-je aller si je n'ai pas de voiture ? Où puis-je camper ? ...</p><p><br/>L'objectif d'Escape est de connecter TOUTES les femmes avec la nature, pas seulement celles qui sont déjà randonneuses et ont l'habitude de ce genre d’expérience.</p><p>Nous devons penser aux femmes qui veulent sortir de leur zone de confort, découvrir quelque-chose de différent, se faire du bien, faire une pause, prendre une vraie bouffée d'air frais pendant plusieurs jours mais ne l'ont jamais fait.</p><p><br/><strong>De quoi ont-elles besoin? D'un service tout-compris.</strong></p><p>Nous offrons le transport aller-retour depuis Manhattan avec le van Escape et notre conductrice (une femme évidemment !), 3 repas par jour, des guides professionnelles, des week-ends inoubliables dont certains à thèmes avec des consultantes dédiées (yoga, pleine conscience, randonnée en français -French touch oblige-, art-thérapie, etc.).</p><p><br/>Nous avons constaté qu'il y a un facteur capital qui bloque de nombreuses femmes qui souhaitent partir en randonnée mais ne l'ont jamais -ou presque jamais- fait: elles n'ont pas le matériel nécessaire ou approprié. Elles ne possèdent pas de sac à dos, sac de couchage, tente, lampe frontale, cape de pluie ... et ne veulent pas investir juste pour un ou deux week-ends par an.</p><p><br/><u>Notre solution ? Fournir le matériel de randonnée et de camping nécessaire.</u> De bonne qualité, durable et conçu pour le corps des femmes (la plupart des sacs à dos notamment ne sont pas adaptés aux formes féminines et sont très inconfortables).</p><p><strong>C'est grâce à l'achat de ce matériel spécifique que nous pourrons offrir à toutes les femmes les joies de l'aventure en pleine nature. </strong></p><p><br/>L'achat de sacs de couchage, de tapis de sol, de bâtons de marche, de tentes, de lampes frontales, de trousses de premiers secours individuelles, de protection contre la pluie, de sacs à dos... pour chaque membre de nos groupes a un coût : 10 000 $ (9.096 Euros).</p><h3>

We have to think about the women who really want to get beyond their comfort zones, want to experience being in the outdoors, but never did it.What do they need? An all-inclusive service.We provide round-trip transportation from Manhattan and back in Escape's van with an awesome experienced driver (a woman of course!), 3 meals a day, professional hiking-and-camping guides, unforgettable weekends with themes and dedicated consultants (yoga, mindfulness, hike in French, art, etc.). We realized there was an unanswered need for a packaged outdoors experience: many women who aren't used to the outdoors don't own a backpack, a sleeping bag, a tent, a head lamp...and they don't want to buy them just for 1 or 2 weekends a year. The solution? In order to connect ALL women with the outdoors we have to provide all necessary hiking-and-camping gear that is high quality, durable and designed FOR women. This is how we can bring women together--especially those new to the outdoors--for an amazing experience in the wilderness. Buying well-made, durable sleeping bags, mats, pads, hiking sticks, tents, headlamps, individual First Aid kits, rain protection, backpacks, hiking poles and other core supplies for our groups has a cost: $10,000. How can you be a part of our ""Every woman deserves an Escape"" challenge and help Escape to buy the gear needed for each client?You can donate right now via this website, just click on the ""BACK IT"" button. If you aren't able to help financially at this time but you still want to support us, please share this campaign, tell your friends and family, etc.Thank you to all the present and future women of the wild!""Do not follow where the path may lead, go instead where there is not path and leave a trail""-Ralph Waldo Emerson-------------------------------------------- Manon Marchand, fondatrice de Escape Hiking for Women, est née et a grandi en France.Il y a quelques années, elle travaillait à Paris en tant que Directrice de communication, vivant une vie urbaine confortable.Alors qu'elle prend le temps de faire une pause et de faire le point sur sa vie, elle décide qu'elle a besoin de changement et d'aventure. Elle quitte Paris et voyage seule pendant 8 mois en Inde et au Népal. C'est au Népal qu'elle se lance un défi un peu fou : partir à l'ascension de l'Annapurna Base Camp (Himalaya). Elle n'a aucune expérience particulière, n’est absolument pas ce qu’on peut appeler une « sportive » et ces dix jours d'efforts physiques intenses à 4200m d'altitude dans des conditions hivernales sont un défi personnel qui va changer sa vie pour toujours.Elle se découvre un potentiel physique et mental qu'elle ignorait et revient avec une confiance en elle toute neuve et un plan pour la suite de sa vie.Elle vit aujourd'hui à New York avec son mari et travaille comme guide randonnée/camping, certifiée par l'Etat de New-York.Escape Hiking for Women est le nouveau défi de Manon: offrir à toutes les femmes la possibilité de vivre ce genre d'expérience, de se sentir plus sauvage, plus forte et plus confiante. C'est aussi pourquoi elle a besoin de vous !
Le concept Escape:
Escape est une entreprise créée et pensée par une femme, dédiée aux New-Yorkaises qui ont envie/besoin de:- Vivre une nouvelle aventure loin de la ville, du stress, du paraître et de leur vie quotidienne- Se (re)connecter avec la nature - Partager une expérience inoubliable entre femmes.Nous offrons des weekends de randonnée (2 jours-1 nuit minimum pour vraiment déconnecter) en pleine nature pour des groupes de 5 femmes accompagnées d'une guide certifiée.Toutes les femmes peuvent bénéficier des bienfaits de la nature, même si elles n’ont jamais fait de randonnée ou de camping. Et elles n'ont pas besoin d'un homme pour les accompagner.Le premier week-end Escape est prévu le 24 Juin 2017.
Pourquoi cette campagne de financement?
Nous savons ce que c'est que de vivre à New York. Nous savons combien il est difficile (voir impossible) de planifier une escapade en plein air : que faire si je n'ai pas de matériel de randonnée/camping ? Où puis-je aller si je n'ai pas de voiture ? Où puis-je camper ? ...L'objectif d'Escape est de connecter TOUTES les femmes avec la nature, pas seulement celles qui sont déjà randonneuses et ont l'habitude de ce genre d’expérience.Nous devons penser aux femmes qui veulent sortir de leur zone de confort, découvrir quelque-chose de différent, se faire du bien, faire une pause, prendre une vraie bouffée d'air frais pendant plusieurs jours mais ne l'ont jamais fait.De quoi ont-elles besoin? D'un service tout-compris.Nous offrons le transport aller-retour depuis Manhattan avec le van Escape et notre conductrice (une femme évidemment !), 3 repas par jour, des guides professionnelles, des week-ends inoubliables dont certains à thèmes avec des consultantes dédiées (yoga, pleine conscience, randonnée en français -French touch oblige-, art-thérapie, etc.).Nous avons constaté qu'il y a un facteur capital qui bloque de nombreuses femmes qui souhaitent partir en randonnée mais ne l'ont jamais -ou presque jamais- fait: elles n'ont pas le matériel nécessaire ou approprié. Elles ne possèdent pas de sac à dos, sac de couchage, tente, lampe frontale, cape de pluie ... et ne veulent pas investir juste pour un ou deux week-ends par an.Notre solution ? Fournir le matériel de randonnée et de camping nécessaire. De bonne qualité, durable et conçu pour le corps des femmes (la plupart des sacs à dos notamment ne sont pas adaptés aux formes féminines et sont très inconfortables).C'est grâce à l'achat de ce matériel spécifique que nous pourrons offrir à toutes les femmes les joies de l'aventure en pleine nature. L'achat de sacs de couchage, de tapis de sol, de bâtons de marche, de tentes, de lampes frontales, de trousses de premiers secours individuelles, de protection contre la pluie, de sacs à dos... pour chaque membre de nos groupes a un coût : 10 000 $ (9.096 Euros).
Comment pouvez-vous faire partie de notre défi « Chaque femme mérite une Escape» et aider Escape Hiking for Women à acheter le matériel nécessaire pour ses clientes?
Vous pouvez faire un don dès maintenant via ce site, en cliquant simplement sur le bouton ""BACK IT"".Si vous n'êtes pas en mesure de nous aider financièrement mais souhaitez nous soutenir différemment, partagez cette campagne via les réseaux sociaux, parlez-en à vos amis, votre famille, etc.Merci de la part de toutes les actuelles et futures 'femmes sauvages’ !« Ne suivez pas un chemin tout tracé, allez plutôt là où il n'y a pas de route et créez votre propre sentier ».

<h3>My Story</h3>
On the night of Easter Sunday 2013, I embarked on a Mission Trip to Nicaragua, helping to lead a group of 40 others. We went with the goal of buidling a community center by a Catholic Church also built by missionary hands in a small town near Chinandega, Nicaragua.  We also ran a carnival for children that lived in a garbage dump, handing out clothing, and food, and playing games with the kids.  The experiance was amazing and I knew right away I needed to come back and not just next year.  I found out right after the trip was over that another group was coming to Nicaragua in the middle of May.  They were going to finish what we started.  I saw a window of opportunity and after finally getting their okay for joining the group, I will be heading back in just a few days.</div>
<div>The trip begins May 15th, and ends May 23rd, 2013.</div>
<div>
<h3>What I need</h3>
<p>This is all very short notice.  I am seeking help in reimbursing my flight costs and accomodations / food / transportation costs.  I am going out on a limb because I know God wants me to go again. I trust it will all work out.</p>
<ul>
<li>Flight Costs: $800</li>
<li>Accomodations, transportation, food costs: $250</li>
<li>Extra money will go towards the projects down there and next years mission trip (I am planning to go again with a large group).</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
I am going on this journey because of a powerful experiance I had just last month.  I know God asks us to take a step at a time and we often times can't see any further ahead.  But I know he wants me to go.  I hope to see our finished project of the Community Center, helping on its final stages, and also to aid the local people there, bringing them closer to God in whatever way God wants to use me, showing them that God loves and cares for them too!</div>

A community of 3,000+ residents is now homeless with ongoing rescue efforts for those trapped in the remote corners of the village.

<h2>The Goal: Short Term and Long Term Assistance</h2>
<p><i>  Short Term Aid:</i> A portion of your contribution will go to meeting the immediate needs of the community. Initial reports indicate that tents, foods, water, and basic medical supplies are the most urgent items needed in the community.  </p>
<p>    In addition, around 50 families have taken shelter at Super Catalyst Academy, a local school. The school suffered minor damage, so your contribution will enable the school to finish construction of a biogas kitchen to be used to cook food for the community and well as improve the school’s restrooms for communal use. </p>
<p><i>Long Term Development:</i> The rest of the proceeds will go directly into construction projects aimed at stabilizing the infrastructure  in Khanikhola. As of now, information is sparse. Reports on the current conditions come out in trickles, so a full fledged plan has yet to materialize. But we’re getting updates every day and will post the finalized plan as it grows. </p>

<p>        We are a collective of volunteers who, through the twists and turns in our lives,  found our way to Khanikhola. Most of us volunteered at Superb Catalyst Academy (SCA), a primary and secondary school focusing on increasing access to education. Khanikhola, like most of Nepal, is very rural. This means going to school is a daily struggle for Nepal’s youngest citizens. SCA’s outreach and assistance programs meant that low-caste, differently abled, and remote students could attend class. SCA has also been at the forefront of women’s empowerment by creating women-lead and oriented development programs. </p>
<p>    Our work with this school has left a profound connection to Khanikhola. We are organizing across the globe to gather support for our dear friends. </p>

<p>      Our efforts are being coordinated on the ground by Ajay Rimal and Shekhar Karki.  Ajay Rimal is the founder and principal of SCA.  Born and raised in Khanikhola, Ajay has committed his life to bringing a both non-discriminatory and  holistic education to the children of his hometown. His is now working with several relief groups to use the funds to purchase critical supplies and is one of the community leaders who will guide the next steps for Khanikhola.  <br/>   Shekhar Karki is the current director of SCA. He has worked as both a Nepal Youth Leader and Lions Club Leader. His high reputation in the community has put him on the front line for disaster relief.

A community of 3,000+ residents is now homeless with ongoing rescue efforts for those trapped in the remote corners of the village. As you can see from the footage above, Kathmandu is in utter disarray. The situation is far worse for Nepalis living outside in the mountainous regions of the country. The full scale of the destruction is only beginning to come to light. 
 The people of Khanikhola are immensely resilient people. However, this recent natural catastrophe is further compounded by the prolonged state of poverty the entire country is immersed in. Given the lack of infrastructure, there is simply no way for Nepal to rebuild itself alone.  

Hope is not lost.We can help. 
The Goal: Short Term and Long Term Assistance
  Short Term Aid: A portion of your contribution will go to meeting the immediate needs of the community. Initial reports indicate that tents, foods, water, and basic medical supplies are the most urgent items needed in the community.  
    In addition, around 50 families have taken shelter at Super Catalyst Academy, a local school. The school suffered minor damage, so your contribution will enable the school to finish construction of a biogas kitchen to be used to cook food for the community and well as improve the school’s restrooms for communal use. 
Long Term Development: The rest of the proceeds will go directly into construction projects aimed at stabilizing the infrastructure  in Khanikhola. As of now, information is sparse. Reports on the current conditions come out in trickles, so a full fledged plan has yet to materialize. But we’re getting updates every day and will post the finalized plan as it grows. 
Who we are.

<p>As mentioned above, being Swiss means we have a cultural imperative to be outdoorsy. We’re mountain bikers and climbers (no kidding - that's really Remo pictured above!), we’re skiers and snowboarders, we’re avid travellers  and we’re also parents and business owners. </p>
<p>Whether we use them as a place to stash our gear, a change of clothes, spare diapers, or important business documents, backpacks go pretty much wherever we go. And we needed a backpack like Slicks Travel System to reflect our lifestyles, which are multifaceted.</p>

</div></div>","The Slicks Travel System is a modular travel backpack with internal inserts designed to keep you organized and looking slick no matter where you are: at work, on the road, or exploring new places.           That’s what we love about traveling, isn’t it? We’re never the same people at the end of the journey as we were when we started out.But the luggage we bring with us stubbornly stays the same. Why is that?Think about it: Right now, your closet is stuffed with pieces of luggage, each one with a single purpose.  Your carry-on roller bag is a box on wheels that has only seen the inside of airports and hotel rooms. You dread the wrinkles you have to iron out of your clothes when you get to your destination—that is, if the carry-on doesn’t get checked at the gate and then lost somewhere between connecting flights.Your gym bag is a big, stinky sack of dirty laundry and toiletries all tossed together like a funk salad. When you go from the gym to work, you have to hide it under your desk or in the trunk of your car because it’s out of place in your buttoned-up office.Your $500 hiking backpack is up on a shelf collecting dust. You bought it for a trip to Alaska. That was five years ago. It’s nice, but at 70 liters it’s too cumbersome and specialized to use as an everyday pack.Your laptop bag is great for carrying your laptop. That’s it. But it’s a pain to get around with a laptop bag and a carry-on roller bag when you’re hailing a cab or riding the train to the airport.Your cycling backpack makes your back sweaty and your clothes wrinkled. When you finally get to work, even after you change your clothes, you look like you’ve been biking through a torrential rainstorm.Then there’s your well-worn backpack you’ve had for a decade. Its buckles are broken, there are holes in the bottom, and you have many painful memories of being the person at the front of the coffee shop line, dumping your personal effects onto the counter in a desperate hunt for your wallet.So far, that’s six bags, each made for different functions, occasions and settings. Add to the mix your hydration pack for mountain biking, your briefcase, and the monogrammed fanny-pack your great-aunt gave you ---that’s a ton of baggage.And what about all the emotional baggage? Stress, embarrassment, frustration, dread…You don’t need all that baggage. You are one person on an amazing journey. You need one bag that transforms to reflect and simplify the many facets of your life.That’s what the Slicks Travel System is all about.                The Slicks Travel System is designed as a modular luggage system, available either as a base backpack only or in three tailored options (SUIT, TRIP & BIZ), each with additional internal inserts to expand the function of the pack.  Let’s take a look the many ways your stuff can fit into the Slicks Travel System (and the many ways the Slicks Travel System will fit into your life).  Cool, huh?Checkout these two videos we made that demonstrate better how you can pack up your Slicks:For 2-3 days business trips
 For 3-4 days leisure holidays
 Now let’s take a closer look at the base backpack.   Let’s say you need a great travel bag that can meet the demands of all kinds of travel, be it your daily commute to work, leisure getaway or business trip. You’ve got that with our 30 Litre capacity Slicks backpack. First of all, take a look at the exterior design:  There’s a reason we call it “Slicks.” We wanted to eliminate all of the hanging bits and bobs (aka “slop” in the baggage industry) and bulky pockets associated with backpacks. The result is a sleek, modern-yet-timeless shape.  You get two color options:  black with a yellow stripe for a sporty look or black with a black logo stripe for a professional look.    Instead of external pockets, we’ve created discreetly-positioned interior pockets behind hidden zippers.  For added security, we have designed zipper pockets where you can stow the zipper pullers, making it difficult for thieves to easily access your valuables.  When needed, you can additionally lock up the main compartment and laptop compartment to secure your pack contents. The front duffle-bag style pocket is a great spot for bulky and irregular shaped items that are the bane of most bags.  On the side, hidden behind a flap, you will find a dedicated compartment for your shoes.  The pack keeps your laptop safe and within easy reach thanks to a dedicated laptop compartment that fits devices up to 15-inches and is suspended for even better protection.  Need to do a quick change to a hipster street look or Mr. Professional? No problem- we've got you covered with Slicks.Just stow away one of the shoulder straps and sling the other one over your shoulder to use your Slicks as a trendy messenger bag.  Or just unclip both the straps and tuck them away, and voila: your Slicks is an elegant attachè.  Here's how Slicks (and you!) transform:  And yes, unlike many bags claiming to be carry-ons, the Slicks pack is compliant with the latest IATA carry-on size recommendations.  The 600D PU-coated Nylon material is water resistant, but just for peace of mind, the pack comes with a seam-sealed, light-weight rain cover stashed in a hidden side pocket, ready to slip on in the event of a downpour.  And if you find yourself cycling at night or crossing roads in foggy weather, we have got plenty of reflective bits on the pack, zipper and rain over to keep you safe. And shiny.  Now let’s crack this baby open and see what’s on the inside:  You’ll notice that in addition to the classic “open from the top” access found in most backpacks, you can also open the Slicks like a suitcase and lay it flat — the clamshell style makes packing easier.   Oh, and what’s this? More pockets? Yep: a pocket for storing valuables, another one for documents, and a mesh pocket as well.      Now that we’ve gotten to know the base pack, let’s acquaint ourselves with what makes the Slicks Travel System a System: the modular inlays.   Are you always on the move, commuting from work to play or vice versa? The SUIT option is designed for anyone who needs to look dapper while they’re on the road.With the SUIT option, the Slicks backpack comes with an ingenious removable Suitcover that keeps your business suit and shirt secure and wrinkle-free in your bag.    Check this out: a nifty collapsible hanger for easy storage.     Are you a road warrior? The TRIP option is the perfect travel companion for work or for adventure. It combines the backpack with a removable Tripcover, a clever and compact double-sided mobile wardrobe for organising your clothes and toiletries.  There are loads of hidden compartments--some you may not discover until your second or third trip!  The front side of the Tripcover features two large zip-around compartments, each with additional zip-pockets - perfect for stashing your socks and underwear.The top large pocket of the Tripcover is designed to pack your clothes, like your jeans and t-shirts.  It also houses a detachable “stink-proof” water-repellent laundry bag, roomy enough to contain a small pile of soiled clothes.  In the lower pocket of the Tripcover, you will find the essential 'dopp-kit'. The hanging washbag has every pocket imaginable including a super-sneaky spot for your contact lens case (no more blind groping around a hotel bathroom).  The dopp-kit is designed to also fit in the 'duffle-style' outside pocket of the backpack --- you end up with more space in the Tripcover to pack clothes. And it gives you easier access to it at airport security or for in-flight use.  The back of the Tripcover opens like a suitcase and there’s enough room in here for two or three shirts; there’s even a pocket for your tie.  The first thing you’ll notice inside is something you don’t see anywhere in travel gear: a Shirtcover with a collar protector--that’s right: no more crumpled collars. By the way, the Shirtcover was inspired by our co-founder, Curdegn’s inability to fold a dress shirt. We know he’s not alone in his exasperation. So to the millions of “folding challenged” out there: this one’s for you:    You’re all of these things: a career-driven professional, an adventure-seeking explorer, and a homebody who wants to relax in the park on a Sunday. For all of those aspects of you, we’ve created the BIZ option: an all-rounder featuring the Slicks backpack, the Suitcover, and the Tripcover. With BIZ, you are ready to configure your Slicks endlessly to adapt to your changing travel needs: business, leisure or commute.  Here's a summary of all the four options that make up the Slicks Travel System:  We’re pretty sure we could stop here and let you get your sweet InDemand deal on a Slicks, but we want you to be absolutely certain that Slicks is going to make your life on the road more organized and stress-free.   Let’s hear some stories from people who’ve gotten a chance to try out the Slicks Travel System. This is just a sampling of the rave reviews our test-nomads are sending back from the field.Check out Peter. He was the first beta-user of a SLICKS Travel System (BIZ option), and for the past six months, he’s been putting it through its paces in every travel scenario you can imagine. In fact, he lived out of the SLICKS as his only bag for a two-week trip through Europe!  Say “Hi” to Mathias. He literally wrote the book on bicycle commuting. He started cycling to lose weight: he started at 350 lbs and within a year, lost 150 lbs. His daily trip is 14 miles each way. Every day. Year-round. Through all weather. In Minnesota.  Meet Kerry Hayes, editor and creator of airportlifestyle.com. She fell in love with travel so much that she married a commercial airline pilot. They both tried out the Slicks BIZ, and this is what they have to say:    As a token of our deep appreciation for choosing to pre-order your Slicks Travel System on Indiegogo InDemand and being uniquely patient to wait for it to be delivered, we have ensured that you'll benefit from MAJOR savings on our entire range.  Here is a summary of the InDemand pre-order options you can choose from:  
 

    Full disclosure:   As in, when you think of Swiss people climbing and skiing Alpine mountains and making the world more efficient, more neutral, and more punctual—we’re totally those guys (okay, so we don’t yodel. Otherwise—Swiss through and through).Think Swiss Army Knife and CERN Large Hadron Collider: we have a national obsession with designing products that reflect and simplify the multifunctional and multidimensional nature of life. The Slicks Travel System is the natural evolutionary step in Swiss design.  As a product design house with engineers and industrial designers, we have over a decade of experience in designing and developing all things Swiss for our global partners. But that’s not where we stop - we also actively project manage production and global shipping logistics with leading contract manufacturers in Asia from our branch office in Taiwan. So we truly understand what it takes to scale up production and manage global logistics - we are not just a bunch of dorky designers. We’re also a bunch of production geeks.  We designed, developed and engineered a little gadget called the World Travel Adapter Pro+ for our partner, SKROSS. It’s the world’s safest and most compact 3-pole outlet adapter that connects to all 2- and 3-pole devices in 150-plus countries worldwide. It’s one of the most popular travel adapters globally and it won the prestigious Red Dot Design Award. It’s an ultimate embodiment of everything that is clever from Switzerland. But enough bragging. So we understand what it takes to design and produce a brilliant product that not only solves problems encountered by travelers, but we also know what it takes to create something that will sell like hotcakes. Compact, efficient, beautifully-designed Swiss hotcakes. (We call them crepes.)   When our co-founder and lead designer, Remo, was a young Swissling in Industrial Design School back in 2004, he wanted to create a way to make hiking backpacks move more naturally with the human body. His patented design, the Flexible Link based backpack carrier, earned him an award in the prestigious Swiss National Design Competition: he used the prize money to start our product design and development company, FLINK in 2005 along with Curdegn, our CEO. We later went on to create several backpack designs for German bike ergonomics manufacturer, ERGON and other global partners. In other words, designing backpacks is our passion.  Oh, right. In 2011, we created an early version of the Slicks backpack to solve a common problem for business professionals: creating a way to both carry a suit wrinkle-free and all their work stuff while commuting. So we came up with the first Slicks backpack with a suit protector insert. It proved to be very popular and got rave reviews from industry experts.After we started to use the original Slicks bag for activities like overnight travel or just walking around town, we realized there were more possibilities to explore. So we improved the overall design of the Slicks backpack and designed a series of modular inlays. The result was a pack that could go anywhere, for any purpose. Thus, the Slicks Travel System was born.
 
As mentioned above, being Swiss means we have a cultural imperative to be outdoorsy. We’re mountain bikers and climbers (no kidding - that's really Remo pictured above!), we’re skiers and snowboarders, we’re avid travellers  and we’re also parents and business owners. 
Whether we use them as a place to stash our gear, a change of clothes, spare diapers, or important business documents, backpacks go pretty much wherever we go. And we needed a backpack like Slicks Travel System to reflect our lifestyles, which are multifaceted.
 
 
Here is the nitty gritty of the Slicks Travel System:
 
 
 
  

 
Just in case you missed something, as we tend to gush endlessly about the glory of the Slicks Travel System. As its creators, we simply can't help it. It’s our baby.

<p>What came next was radical and crazy for me, but I felt God calling me to excitedly yet nervously click on the 'apply' button to <strong>The World Race.</strong> </p>
<p>The World Race is an 11 month trip to 11 different countries with an organization called Adventures in Missions.</p>
<p>I'll be leaving my home, family and friends in January 2013 and returning the following December. Through adventures, ministry, community, and self-discovery, my team and I will develop broken hearts that propel our hands to act for God’s kingdom around the globe.</p>
<p><strong>On the Race we will partner with churches and ministries in local communities to proclaim the Gospel, build churches, feed orphans, and bring help and hope to women and children trapped in slavery and prostitution.</strong> I get to be uncomfortable. I'll have to cram a year into my backpack and live in strange, dangerous places.<strong> But God is worth it.</strong> All these things seem big when I compare them to me, but when compared to God--He suddenly gets the chance to display His power and accomplish much through my weakness.</p>

<p>Any left over funds I have will go straight to supporting another racer if I don't raise what I need. But I know that God called me to do this, and am pretty confident He won't stop until His work in this is accomplished! </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>""There is a generation of radicals whose heartbeat is to <strong>see a changed world</strong>.

We will be teaching crafts and music as well as teaching them about Jesus and how to share Him with their friends and families.   I am so blessed to have the opportunity not only to travel to the other side of the world but to share the love and grace of our lord and savior. I cannot wait to see what God has planned during this missions trip. I am not only excited to hopefully help make an impact on India, but I am also very excited for India to make an impact me and my walk with God.>Details of this trip:The dates are July 18th -August 3rd. I will need to raise around $2,800 for the trip. As I begin to prepare for my first missions trip, I would very much appreciate your financial support, but way more importantly, we need your prayers! I am SO excited to see what God does through my team on this trip, and to see how God grows me.  >Some things to pray for:-Godly team unity, to make the focus about sharing the Gospel to the best of our abilities.-That we would all be able to raise the money without stress.-That the Holy Spirit would move through us, and we wouldn't be a hindrance to that.Proverbs 16:8 says “I keep my eyes always on the LORD, with HIM at my right hand I will not be shaken.” I trust that he will protect my team and I while we do what he has called us to do! So yes, pray for our safety, but more importantly pray for our impact there, and that we will accomplish great things through him and him alone.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>In the 2012 Motorcycle Cannonball Run, our 1929 BMW R11 was definitely a long shot. It had the smallest engine with the lowest horsepower in our class, and we were matched against teams that had previously run in the 2010 coast-to-coast event. </p>

In the tie breaking system we finished 3rd overall, beating nearly 100 motorcycles from all over the world.

<p>Hello, I'm Aditya, the founder of Viviva Colors. I am a 3rd year medschool student in Seth GS Medical College and King Edward Memorial Hospital in Mumbai, India, the land of colors! I have always been fond of water coloring, but after joining medschool I found that I hardly ever painted. It was so inconvenient to carry all the equipment - the pans, tubes, palettes… ughhh! I knew there had to be a better way to do it and while studying one of the diagnostic techniques that involves picking a substrate off a paper, I had a brainwave: What if I tried to make a sheet with water colors on them. The idea stuck and I started looking for a way to do it. It took me a year but I finally found an expert on dyes and worked with him to develop the technology. I got in my brother Rohan to help me with setting up the supply chain and branding over the last few months and now the only thing left is to buy the raw materials in large enough quantity to bring the price point down (I'd have to sell my kidney for making them in very small volumes).</p>

It is the easiest and the most convenient watercolor set to paint on the go. It's a set of 16 transparent, beautiful watercolors. Each sheet is made of a super saturated layer of the color deposited on paper. They're a joy to pick up with a brush: simply pick and paint and you get this really intense, vibrant color.

<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>About me:</strong></p>
<p>Hi, my name is Chris Jones.  I suffered some life-changing injuries whilst serving in the British Army, which caused me to re-think a lot of the things I used to be passionate about doing, and meant I had to find new ways to do the things I love.  One of those things was mountain biking, and in 2011 I decided to find a way to go mountain biking again.  This is always going to be tricky when you’ve lost almost 50% of the mobility in both your legs, but having spent years watching my Wife and Son head off across the moor on their bikes, I was determined to find a way to join them.  After some extensive searching of the internet I learned that almost all of the hand powered bikes available were designed for road use, and the cheapest hand-powered bike I could find cost £3,000.  Those bikes that claimed to be designed for off-road use were mostly road frames with off-road tyres on, which meant they were suitable for canal paths and other well made tracks, but wouldn’t handle the kind of terrain I wanted to ride on Dartmoor, and bikes specifically designed for off-road use started from £5,000.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Having bought myself a hand-cranked, off-road bike, and discovered first hand just how poor their performance really is, I decided that disabled people deserve to have high-quality, affordable mountain bikes, just like everyone else.  As a result I have spent the last 10 months working with a professional design engineer to develop a bike that is not just a proper mountain bike, adapted to suit a variety of disabilities, but which will sell for less than half the price that a disabled person would currently have to spend on an adaptive mountain bike.  We believe this is the first time that an adaptive mountain bike has been designed in this way; from scratch by a professional engineer, first and foremost as a mountain bike, and <em>then </em>as an adaptive bike.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your money will help us to now bring that design to life, and allow us to test it fully before bringing it into production for the millions of disabled people in the UK, and around the World, who simply want to ride a bike through the countryside with their friends and family.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Your investment and reward:</strong></p>
<p>We now need to raise £40,000, which will allow us to achieve the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Completion of the design to a manufacturing spec, allowing the design to be put straight into production once testing is complete.</li>
<li>Construction and testing of prototype bikes, tested not just for the range of conditions they can handle, but for the range of disabilities they can accommodate.</li>
<li>Addition and testing of existing adaptive components to fit an even wider range of disabled riders.</li>
<li>By completing all of the above we will be ready to put the bikes into production, hopefully by the end of 2013/early 2014.</li>
</ul><p>In return for your money you will receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>From £5, a hand-written letter of thanks.</li>
<li>From £50, a limited edition Merici Sports t-shirt from Supersaturated.</li>
</ul><p>If we don’t raise the full £40,000 we will still put the amount we have raised into building the prototype, it just may take us a little longer than we’d planned as we will have to raise the remaining amount from other sources, which will take time and will detract from the main focus, that of testing the bikes.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Disabled people are often excluded from normal daily activities, or at best will receive a marginalised, watered-down version of the experience that able-bodied people get.</li>
<li>Adaptive equipment often costs a vast amount more than the able-bodied equivalents, creating further barriers to disabled participation.</li>
<li>Most families with a disabled member will forego normal family activities so as not to isolate the person with the disability, meaning the whole family miss out on opportunities that normal families take for-granted.</li>
<li>By helping us to move forward with this project you will allow us to finally show disabled people world-wide that they need not accept the status quo.</li>
<li>Your support will allow us to show the world that people with disabilities will take up active sports if the right equipment is made available at the right price.</li>
<li>You can be part of a project that will give people with disabilities affordable, independent access to places they have simply not been able to get to until now.</li>

By completing all of the above we will be ready to put the bikes into production, hopefully by the end of 2013/early 2014.
In return for your money you will receive:

From £5, a hand-written letter of thanks.
From £50, a limited edition Merici Sports t-shirt from Supersaturated.
If we don’t raise the full £40,000 we will still put the amount we have raised into building the prototype, it just may take us a little longer than we’d planned as we will have to raise the remaining amount from other sources, which will take time and will detract from the main focus, that of testing the bikes.
The Impact

Disabled people are often excluded from normal daily activities, or at best will receive a marginalised, watered-down version of the experience that able-bodied people get.
Adaptive equipment often costs a vast amount more than the able-bodied equivalents, creating further barriers to disabled participation.
Most families with a disabled member will forego normal family activities so as not to isolate the person with the disability, meaning the whole family miss out on opportunities that normal families take for-granted.
By helping us to move forward with this project you will allow us to finally show disabled people world-wide that they need not accept the status quo.
Your support will allow us to show the world that people with disabilities will take up active sports if the right equipment is made available at the right price.
You can be part of a project that will give people with disabilities affordable, independent access to places they have simply not been able to get to until now.

<h3>Who I am</h3>
<p>Well, as I'm not advertising this all that widely, I'm going to assume that anyone looking at it, already has a rough idea of the answer to this... but just in case you don't, I'll sum it up in brief.  I am:</p>
<ul>
<li>A professional photographic model from England.  Very experienced in all genres from classic art-nudes, through to fashion, fetish and all things creative and artistic.</li>
<li>A nomad.  I travel everywhere.  Constantly.</li>
<li>An all round lovely person, who makes a cracking cup of tea!</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm planning my first ever trip to <strong>Australia </strong>in October, but as it's a rather long way I'm hoping to get enough confirmed bookings to cover my flight before I leave.</p>
<p>I plan to start off in <strong>Sydney</strong> on <strong>8th October</strong>, and then work my way around to other places depending on where the demand is!</p>
<p>I don't get a penny until I've reached my target for booking my flights... and if I don't reach my target, you automatically [b]get your money back[/b].</p>
<p>I [b]never[/b] no show. And can point you in the direction of countless models and photographers (and even a few Australia based friends) you can talk to to vouch for my reliability and professionalism.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My £2200 target is a rough estimate of how much I'll need to arrange my flights, visas, and a tiny bit extra to keep me afloat whilst I'm out there (busses, food, etc.).  I'm not really expecting there to be any profit from this, but I love to travel, see new places, meet new people, and most importantly, create some <strong>art</strong>!</p>
<p>Essentially, when donating here is exactly the same as just booking a model for a shoot in the normal way.  But please contact me to confirm the date and time slot <strong>before </strong>you pay on here, or I won't be able to guarantee that I'm free!</p>
<p>Once you've booked a shoot, I'll stay in contact with you to discuss all your concepts and ideas in advance and will do my best to bring all the clothing, hair styling, and make-up you require.</p>
<p>The price for these shoots include all the styles I work in, which can be seen on my <a href=""http://gestalta.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a>, where you can also find a lot more information about me and my work! :)</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>This is a trip that I'll be doing on an extremely low budget, with very little profit, so any ways I can cut costs whilst I'm there are always useful... if you have a spare room / sofa I can crash on, can feed me, or offer me transportation then this is always appreciated; if you're an artist/photographer I will happily give you a discount if I take you up on this offer.</p>
<p>Also... tell all your artist/photographer friends ^_^</p>

<div> </div>
<div>Last year, the Qlipter launched as a highly successful crowdfunding campaign.<p>To our delight, the Qlipter received immediate high praise from customers and reviewers for innovative design and functionality.  </p>
<p>We also received several requests for a smaller version that would fit well in a palm and be more suitable for urban, parenting and travel uses.  The Qliplet is about 20% smaller than the Qlipter and is completely re-designed.  <b>Our goal as a company is to give customers OPTIONS in size and style.</b></p>

Rather than having one rotation point and one folding point, the Qliplet has two folding joints and a rotating joint to help hanging items find their natural center of gravity.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Our closing mechanism has been redesigned as well so that the spring stay retains the hook when closed.  The foot of of the hook has a rubber overmold to increase grip when resting on surfaces.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Lastly, the Qliplet is made out of solid aluminum using CNC machining while the Qlipter uses a die-cast process.  This allows us to offer more colors and in a smooth, anodized finish.</div>

<p><b>2.  What's up with Go Girl Green?</b></p>
<p>You might be wondering about the Go Girl Green Qliplet model in honor of the Girl Scouts of Western Washington.  Although we are a small, start-up company, we wanted to find a way to give to back to our community.  While there are many great causes, we are currently supporting the Girl Scouts of Western Washington because as a mom of a little girl  and a volunteer content developer in the Cookie CEO program, I am personally aligned with the Girl Scouts mission of “building girls of courage, confidence and character who make the world a better place.”</p>

<p> </p>
<div>In light of the Girl Scouts of Western Washington’s own recent IndieGoGo campaign (#forEVERYgirl), we wanted to help to support our hometown chapter and created a special model just for them.  Twenty percent of the funds raised for this model of Qliplet will go to the Girl Scouts of Western Washington. Once produced, with your help, a portion of each future Go Girl Green Qliplet sold will continue to be contributed to them, as well. So, please help to fund the Go Girl Green Qliplet during our campaign and support the Girl Scouts of Western Washington in fostering the strong and capable girls our future needs!</div>

</div></div>","The Qliplet is now shipping!  
Thanks to our backers at Indiegogo, we successfully launched the Qliplet and it is now available to everyone.   To show our love to Indiegogo, we are offering special pricing and free shipping to everyone on Indiegogo.  AND we are offering our limited inventory of the titanium model exclusively on Indiegogo.
 
Some of life's greatest adventures require lugging a lot of stuff. The Qliplet is a revolutionary carabiner with rotating hook so you can keep your hands free and do more in your life. 
  
 

Technical specs 
Materials:  Solid billet aluminum 6061 (aircraft grade); Nylon 6; stainless steel screw and rivets; rubber overmold
Finish:  AnodizationMethod:  CNC (Computerized numerical control) machining for precisionDimensions:  3"" (width), 3.75"" (length), 0.25"" (metal arm thickness)Weight:  2 oz.Capacity:  50 lbs (inert weight only; not for climbing) 
 

The open hook and the flexible joints allow extra versatility. 
 

And the Qliplet's slim profile fits into narrow and small spaces.
 


 We have spent nearly a year perfecting our design and engineering and building a relationship with our manufacturing partner to ensure a smooth production process without delays.  Because we are using CNC (computerized numerical control) machinery rather than die casting, there is no need for tooling which can take over a month.  We will be delivering your Qliplets early December, just in time for holiday travel and gifting.  


  The Qliplet was invented by Mina Yoo, a mom, inventor, entrepreneur and someone who loves adventures of all kinds.  When she had her first child four years ago and then started training to summit Mt. Rainier 5 months later, she realized that the only downside of many of life's most fulfilling adventures is that they require lugging a lot of stuff.  Mina decided to start a business, Lulabop, devoted to helping you LIVE more, while carrying less stuff.
 
 


 
Her vision first became reality last year when Lulabop launched a campaign for its first product to great success.  The Qliplet is a newly designed, smaller product created as a part of the original product line to give customers more options in size and style.  Please see FAQs for more detail on how the Qliplet is different from its older sibling. 
 

The Team

  
 



 
We know that there are some of you who are as geeky as we are and would love to know more about the design and manufacturing process.  In the process of coming to our current design, we made endless 3-D prints and several prototypes in the actual materials.  Luckily, 3-D printing is really cool!

 
The Qliplet arms are made using the same advanced CNC (computerized numerical control) technology that is used in jet aircraft and race cars. Each arm is precision-machined out of solid billet aluminum, then hard anodized for a gorgeous finish. Even the spring in the Qliplet is made using this super high precision machine.  Check out how it's made!
 
 
 

 
 



Over the past year, we've built several rounds of prototypes of the Qliplet.  We have put everything we learned about manufacturing, quality control and logistics from our previous product and created a process to ensure that all of our production goes as smoothly as possible. Our team  has visited numerous factories to select one that understands our high standards of quality for material and assembly. Our company already has a track record of delivering products to crowdfunding backers and has engaged in 7 production runs in as many months.  The quality of our existing product is high enough to have been placed in large retailers like REI and Big 5 Sporting Goods, and our capacity is robust enough to fulfill these orders.   

 
Despite our company's success so far, the reality is that producing goods in high enough volume so that they are affordable to all (we truly believe that the Qliplet will benefit EVERYONE's lives) requires capital.  With your help, we can bring the Qliplet to life!
 
 
 
There are challenges for sure when manufacturing a product.  Every lesson I have personally learned about manufacturing and delivery from my first product has been applied to the production planning for the Qliplet.  I have furthered added two team members, John and Andy, who have extensive engineering and production experience (over 40 years combined).  
Our team has also spent the past few months visiting manufacturers, interviewing them and reviewing their work to select the right partner.  Having selected one, we have received several samples of the Qliplet and have worked closely with them to ensure that communication lines, quality expectations and delivery timelines are crystal clear.  Andy, our manufacturing engineer, is based in Hong Kong and will maintain daily contact with our manufacturing partner and visit them at least weekly to ensure that we are on schedule and quality standards are met or exceeded.
 

 
 1.  How is the Qliplet different from its older sibling the Qlipter?
 
Last year, the Qlipter launched as a highly successful crowdfunding campaign.To our delight, the Qlipter received immediate high praise from customers and reviewers for innovative design and functionality.  
We also received several requests for a smaller version that would fit well in a palm and be more suitable for urban, parenting and travel uses.  The Qliplet is about 20% smaller than the Qlipter and is completely re-designed.  Our goal as a company is to give customers OPTIONS in size and style.
 
 In terms of design, the Qliplet uses a completely different pivot system. Rather than having one rotation point and one folding point, the Qliplet has two folding joints and a rotating joint to help hanging items find their natural center of gravity.
 
Our closing mechanism has been redesigned as well so that the spring stay retains the hook when closed.  The foot of of the hook has a rubber overmold to increase grip when resting on surfaces.
 
Lastly, the Qliplet is made out of solid aluminum using CNC machining while the Qlipter uses a die-cast process.  This allows us to offer more colors and in a smooth, anodized finish.
 


2.  What's up with Go Girl Green?
You might be wondering about the Go Girl Green Qliplet model in honor of the Girl Scouts of Western Washington.  Although we are a small, start-up company, we wanted to find a way to give to back to our community.  While there are many great causes, we are currently supporting the Girl Scouts of Western Washington because as a mom of a little girl  and a volunteer content developer in the Cookie CEO program, I am personally aligned with the Girl Scouts mission of “building girls of courage, confidence and character who make the world a better place.”
 

 
In light of the Girl Scouts of Western Washington’s own recent IndieGoGo campaign (#forEVERYgirl), we wanted to help to support our hometown chapter and created a special model just for them.  Twenty percent of the funds raised for this model of Qliplet will go to the Girl Scouts of Western Washington. Once produced, with your help, a portion of each future Go Girl Green Qliplet sold will continue to be contributed to them, as well. So, please help to fund the Go Girl Green Qliplet during our campaign and support the Girl Scouts of Western Washington in fostering the strong and capable girls our future needs!
 

 
A little more excitement, please?
 

 

3.  How will you ship?

 
We will ship all units, international and domestic, using the US Postal Service. Within the US, for pledges over $50, we will ship via US Priority Mail with tracking.  
 

4.  How do we pick the color options? 
After the end of the campaign, we will send you a questionnaire through which you can let us know what colors you would like and also confirm your address.
 
5.  Hey, why don't you get a rap song made about the Qliplet?

This crowd fund is to cover the costs incurred to realise the NYR 'Indy
App' project. Some of the expenses include: the Indy
App design and creation costs by professional coders, the
production of support resources such as Tutorial films, live web seminars and
Help films linked to each IndyApp function for ease of use by its members. We
will also be creating each of the ‘front doors’ on the Indy App for
the 80+ (and growing) local groups already expressing their wishes to
participate. This will all be done in the run up to our public launch ready for
searches by the general public on download come the 18th of September.  We will also however need a much longer follow up 'tour of the groups' for after the public launch date. This later 'tour of the groups' will be designed to get everybody  organised and ready to access all the functions of the Indy App.  Specifically, ensuring each group knows how to post effectively on the 'National Forum'. Each tour will (as usual) be carried out by traveling and sleeping in 'the wee blue van', an integral member of our NYR team! :-)For a fuller explanation of our roll-out strategy (both before and after our public launch on September the 18th) please read  this link http://tinyurl.com/zojrqzf NYR Indy App in PrintThe National                                tinyurl.com/zocfc4m                                                                                                            tinyurl.com/zy82fdzThe Sunday Herald                        tinyurl.com/hxk482x                                                                                                                            tinyurl.com/hb5kdqfThe Sunday Post                            tinyurl.com/jysllxpOur breakdown of project expenses:Indy AppDesign                                                                                                                             £1500Coding +Delivery                                                                                                        £3000Developments and updates                                                                                      £800Films and Tutorials (incl. equipment and rental)                                             £1200Start up server space                                                                                                  £550Office rent + bills                  12 months x £195                                                   £2340

<p><b>CUSTOMS &amp; DUTIES INFORMATION </b></p>
<p>NOMATIC cannot mark orders as gifts. This is illegal, so we will not be able to do this. </p>
<p>Our prices DO NOT include VAT, GST or other country taxes. </p>
<p>As many of you know, our terms of sale for international orders are FOB destination. This means that you pay all freight and duties or taxes. As we are shipping these products all over the world, it is impossible for us to build in the various duties, VAT and GST tax for each location through Indiegogo. </p>
<p>We found this handy tool, that can assist you in calculating duties. Remember to convert the U.S. dollars to your local currency: </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.dutycalculator.com/new-import-duty-and-tax-calculation"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.dutycalculator.com/new-import-duty-and-tax-calculation</a> </p>
<p>For international customers who are required to pay customs, you will receive an email from GFS Gateway, First Mile, or your local customs authorities asking for payment to have your order processed through customs. Unfortunately, there is no legal way around customs. Once you make that payment to the customs broker your order will be processed for final delivery. </p>
<p> <b>SHIPPING PROCEDURE</b> </p>
<p>Within 24 hours of your order being shipped you will receive a tracking link with your shipping details. When you receive your tracking #, please keep an eye out for the package. We use a shared post shipping method to have your order delivered at an affordable price. Your order will ship out from our shipping facility in Salt Lake City, UT with a major shipping company, or with a tracking link from First Mile. </p>
<p>Your order will be handled by UPS, USPS, RRDonnelley or DHL up to entry of your country. Once your order enters your country your order will be handed off to your local post office for final delivery. International transit will have a 7-21 Business day delivery time. U.S Domestic shipments will take 3-5 business days.</p>
<p><b>SHIPPING POLICY </b></p>
<p>If our shipping carrier attempts delivery to you and you don't get it because you’re not there, wrong address, moved without notifying us, and the package returns back to our warehouse, it will be the buyer's responsibility to pay the shipping fee to reship the order. When you receive your tracking #, please keep an eye out for the package.</p>

CUSTOMS & DUTIES INFORMATION 
NOMATIC cannot mark orders as gifts. This is illegal, so we will not be able to do this. 
Our prices DO NOT include VAT, GST or other country taxes. 
As many of you know, our terms of sale for international orders are FOB destination. This means that you pay all freight and duties or taxes. As we are shipping these products all over the world, it is impossible for us to build in the various duties, VAT and GST tax for each location through Indiegogo. 
We found this handy tool, that can assist you in calculating duties. Remember to convert the U.S. dollars to your local currency: 
http://www.dutycalculator.com/new-import-duty-and-tax-calculation 
For international customers who are required to pay customs, you will receive an email from GFS Gateway, First Mile, or your local customs authorities asking for payment to have your order processed through customs. Unfortunately, there is no legal way around customs. Once you make that payment to the customs broker your order will be processed for final delivery. 
 SHIPPING PROCEDURE 
Within 24 hours of your order being shipped you will receive a tracking link with your shipping details. When you receive your tracking #, please keep an eye out for the package. We use a shared post shipping method to have your order delivered at an affordable price. Your order will ship out from our shipping facility in Salt Lake City, UT with a major shipping company, or with a tracking link from First Mile. 
Your order will be handled by UPS, USPS, RRDonnelley or DHL up to entry of your country. Once your order enters your country your order will be handed off to your local post office for final delivery. International transit will have a 7-21 Business day delivery time. U.S Domestic shipments will take 3-5 business days.
SHIPPING POLICY 
If our shipping carrier attempts delivery to you and you don't get it because you’re not there, wrong address, moved without notifying us, and the package returns back to our warehouse, it will be the buyer's responsibility to pay the shipping fee to reship the order. When you receive your tracking #, please keep an eye out for the package.",28.0,1,"8 Campaigns

<h3></h3>
<p><b>Haven’t you ever wanted to step outside of yourself, your
life, your existence for just a moment to help you get a better understanding
of what your purpose really is in life? </b>Have you ever wished that you could experience
something so meaningful that you would honestly be changed, for the better, forever? I believe that I have been given this very opportunity!</p>
<p>I am so excited to share with my friends the news that I
will be heading on a mission trip to Nicaragua in December. I will be traveling
with nine other people from my church. We will be doing several things while
there but focusing on working with children that travel for hours carrying
their spoons and bowls to come to a nutrition center that is far away from
their homes. Here they will feel the love and kindness of strangers but most of
all be introduced to the greatest love one could ever know – the love of the
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>I am trying to raise $1,500. Now this should cover my costs
of the trip and then a little more. The ""little more"" will directly benefit those we will be serving while we are there. This money will only be used for this cause. If you prefer, donations can be made to the
missions fund by contacting the church directly at 941-922-4434. Learn more about my church by going online
to <a href=""http://www.fccsarasota.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.fccsarasota.com</a>. </p>
<p><b>Now to some people you are already tuning out. I understand.
All I can ask that you believe in our friendship enough to consider helping me
as an individual do something that I truly believe in. </b>To others you might be
surprised. It is true, I am probably not the first person you would consider
when you think of the term “missionary”. I ask you to rethink what is possible.
I challenge you to consider that even though I have lived a colorful life that
God still loves me. (And you too for that matter). That he finds the value in who
I am as a human being… and he wants to use me, my talents, my compassion, to
help others. Maybe it’s through sharing how far I have come. Maybe it’s through
my storytelling abilities. But maybe, just maybe, it’s just by being your
friend when you need me. Listening when you need an ear, driving you when you
need a ride, watching your pets or kids when you need a helping hand, or just a hug
when you feel like someone who needed a hug. Whatever our friendship means to you… this is me asking you to reach out and consider helping me with
something bigger than all of us. </p>
<p>I plan on sharing my trip through the gift that I was given
of writing. If you can’t give money, I of all people understand. I hope that
you will consider following along my journey and maybe you will see that our
own problems are so small in the big scheme of life. My greatest hope is that
someone who can’t take a trip like this for whatever reason will still reap the
benefits of following the journey with me and seeing it through my eyes.</p>
<p>No donation is too small, no prayers are too few, and your friendship does and will always continue to mean the world to me. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Thank you for taking a moment to consider the possibility. </span></p>

I am as a human being… and he wants to use me, my talents, my compassion, to
help others. Maybe it’s through sharing how far I have come. Maybe it’s through
my storytelling abilities. But maybe, just maybe, it’s just by being your
friend when you need me. Listening when you need an ear, driving you when you
need a ride, watching your pets or kids when you need a helping hand, or just a hug
when you feel like someone who needed a hug. Whatever our friendship means to you… this is me asking you to reach out and consider helping me with
something bigger than all of us. 
I plan on sharing my trip through the gift that I was given
of writing. If you can’t give money, I of all people understand. I hope that
you will consider following along my journey and maybe you will see that our
own problems are so small in the big scheme of life. My greatest hope is that
someone who can’t take a trip like this for whatever reason will still reap the
benefits of following the journey with me and seeing it through my eyes.
No donation is too small, no prayers are too few, and your friendship does and will always continue to mean the world to me. Thank you for taking a moment to consider the possibility.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Hey everyone,</p>
<p>Our names are Harry and Mike, we have been good friends for four years now after going to college together. On the 23rd of August 2011, we're embarking on a 500mile cycle ride around the south coast of Wales to raise money for two charities: Caroline's Rainbow and Hazel's footprints. These charities educate teenagers about the importance of both experiencing new cultures and the potential dangers one can face from travelling. These causes are very important to us as a close friend of ours nearly died after he was brutally attacked and robbed in his hotel room in India.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>What happened to our friend sounds like a horror story but the fact is every year teenagers abroad are seriously injured or lose their lives from lack of awareness. Caroline's rainbow was set up from such a horror story, and aims to provide information about safety abroad. Hazel's footprints, is also set up in name of someone and provides travel grants to individuals who's planned trip is both safe and helps those less privileged than themselves. By rising money for these charities, we are helping them to carry on the great work they do. </p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We will be filming our entire trip on two helmet cameras and a hand held camera. All the best bits will be turned  into a 45 minuet film that anyone who sponsors us can view for free. We will be doing a series of tasks which will get more stupid and more embarrassing with the more money we raise. These tasks will of course be filmed. We will also be taking photos for a naked calendar that will be released after our trip, which can be purchased for around £5.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I’m Lesley Nase, I grew up in the southern part of Vermont
where my parents Mary &amp; Larry Pratt started a campground 53 years ago
called Camping on the Battenkill. In 1994 when my father passed away I came to
live at the campground to help run it with my brother. That was until August of
2011 when tropical storm Irene damaged three-fourths of the campground. Two
things happen at that time. My job at the campground changed from a fulltime
paying job to a labor of love rebuilding the campground as there was no money
to pay me. Camping on the Battenkill reopened for 2012 camping season with the
help of family, many friends and other campground owners. I am forever grateful
to all those who gave physical to help clear away debris, to those who helped
connect us to other avenues of help in the form of loans and grants and especially
to two campground owners who at the time of the disaster drove the length of state
offering their knowledge on rebuilding. The campground is still recovering. </p>

<p>Natural disasters can be a way of looking at your life and

those who reached out a helping hand. When the Vermont Campground Association
announced that in 2014 they would be celebrating their 50<sup>th</sup> year as
a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting camping in the state, I had my

</div><p>In the background of the news, behind the focus on how Ed
Miliband’s nasal voice is not fit to lead the country and the obsession with
the ‘swarms’ of immigrants pouring in, a very real crisis has occurred in
Malawi. It has experienced its worst floods in half a century, with 638,000
people, according to the UN, being affected. </p>
<p>I thought this would be a good place to start my blog as I
spent 6 weeks volunteering in Malawi with the Tikondwe Youth Project. The
organisation’s motto is ‘Accept what you can’t change. Change what you can’t
accept’ and that is exactly what they have been doing in the community of
Domasi, Malawi. Tikondwe has set up a number of schemes such as schools, feeding
programmes, a teacher training programme for locals, all with the aim to
encourage self-dependence in the community, so that it can learn to combat
poverty.</p>
<p>Malawi isn’t nicknamed ‘the warm heart of Africa’ for no
reason. From the very moment of stepping off the plane, at which everyone
clapped as they were so happy it had landed, I felt welcome.  Even when crammed into a 12-seater minibus
with 24 other people, with a live chicken to my left and a huge bag of smelly
fish to my right, I still felt more comfortable and at ease than any bus in
England. Anyway, rather than going on about how it was a life changing
experience, which it was by the way, it is important not to forget the people
that made my time there so special.</p>
<p>Malawi is one of the world’s poorest and least-developed
countries, which is why the floods have been so devastating. The majority of
Malawian’s homes are built using mud, meaning that they have been swept away by
the floods, along with all their possessions. Not only that, but sources of
income, in the form of livestock and crops, have been swept away or destroyed
as well. Unicef have also warned that there is a serious risk of the spread of
diseases, such as malaria, due to stagnant water and malnutrition. Although
many in Malawi will simply say <i>‘osadandaula’ </i>– no worries, it is very
difficult to see how those who have already lost so much in the floods will be
able to rebuild their lives again without the aid of others.</p>
By donating to the Tikondwe Youth Project, it can be
ensured that services will get to those who need it most, particularly as it
has much experience with agriculture and the building of homes. <p></p></div>","In the background of the news, behind the focus on how Ed

<h2><strong>Resumo</strong></h2>
<p>Eu quero ir mais longe! Como fotógrafo de viagem e aventura tenho sentido a necessidade de explorar mais, e por vezes só as pernas não chegam. Existem tantos sítios onde um carro ainda não chega. Por isso decidi voltar ao meio de transporte que sempre me deu tantas alegrias: a bicicleta!</p>
<p>Venho pedir a vossa ajuda para este projecto que é levar-me a conhecer, fotografar e partilhar sítios novos e mais recônditos. Já tenho algumas ideias, mas falta-me o mais importante, a bicicleta que me permita ir mais longe e melhor.

<h3><strong>Sobre mim</strong></h3>
<p>Olá! O meu nome é David Pires, nasci nos anos 90 e sou um algarvio a viver na bela cidade de Lisboa. Muito do meu tempo é passado a fotografar (e por vezes faço uns vídeos) com principal foco em viagem, aventura e lifestyle. O resto do tempo é passado com a Maria e o meu filho, o Xavier, em aventuras na natureza, a ler ou a fazer uns petiscos para partilhar com quem mais gosto. </p>

</div></div>","Resumo
Eu quero ir mais longe! Como fotógrafo de viagem e aventura tenho sentido a necessidade de explorar mais, e por vezes só as pernas não chegam. Existem tantos sítios onde um carro ainda não chega. Por isso decidi voltar ao meio de transporte que sempre me deu tantas alegrias: a bicicleta!
Venho pedir a vossa ajuda para este projecto que é levar-me a conhecer, fotografar e partilhar sítios novos e mais recônditos. Já tenho algumas ideias, mas falta-me o mais importante, a bicicleta que me permita ir mais longe e melhor. Ao contribuírem, não só estarão a colocar um sorriso na minha cara, mas também a ter acesso a uma série de produtos e serviços, relacionados com fotografia e afins, fornecidos por mim.
Espero poder contar com todos vós!
 

 
Sobre mim
Olá! O meu nome é David Pires, nasci nos anos 90 e sou um algarvio a viver na bela cidade de Lisboa. Muito do meu tempo é passado a fotografar (e por vezes faço uns vídeos) com principal foco em viagem, aventura e lifestyle. O resto do tempo é passado com a Maria e o meu filho, o Xavier, em aventuras na natureza, a ler ou a fazer uns petiscos para partilhar com quem mais gosto. 

 

O que eu preciso
Para conseguir avançar sobre rodas por esse mundo fora preciso, no mínimo, de €1650. Com isso e alguns extras poderei avançar com a compra de:

Bicicleta Gravel;
Sapatos de ciclismo;
Saco de selim e quadro;
Roupa extra;
Taxa IndieGogo.

 
O que dou em troca
Como não estou aqui só para pedir, vou querer, de alguma forma, devolver algo a quem me apoie. A melhor maneira que encontro para o fazer é fornecer os meus produtos e serviços. Na lista de Perks podem ver com mais detalhe tudo o que tenho ao dispor: desde prints (em várias dimensões) a sessões fotográficas, bem como presets de edição, ou até mesmo workshops privados de fotografia. Também podem contribuir sem querer nada em troca, ou até ter uma outra sugestão de algo que eu possa oferecer (babysitting, passear o cão, fotografar um casamento, ir ao IKEA comprar almôndegas, entre outros) e podemos falar sobre isso :)
 

O impacto
Tenho sempre várias ideias e projectos na cabeça. Muitos deles são sobre como posso aproveitar melhor a natureza, como posso criar aventuras diferentes, como posso ir a sítios novos. Ter uma bicicleta que seja capaz de enfrentar caminhos menos explorados, estradas terciárias e quilómetros sinuosos é uma das respostas a essas necessidades.Vou poder criar, mostrar e partilhar novas formas de aventura e natureza enquanto me mantenho em forma e faço o melhor possível para respeitar o nosso planeta!

<p>Based on a combination of the different types of <i>Solar Pump® </i>collectors and the various ways they can be integrated, the <b><i>Solar Pump</i>® </b>system is an ecological and economical alternative to gas and other fossil fuels. With the great productivity of its solar collectors and its thermodynamic heart, the <i>Solar Pump® </i>generates a higher net energy balance than the other renewable power plants and is <b>the world's most efficient solar water heater</b>. </p>
<p><b>With <i>Solar Pump</i>® systems, we deliver a  100% renewable energy hot water for less than hot water produced by the cheapest known energy (which is gas - a fossil fuel by the way) and with no release of CO2 into the atmosphere.</b></p>
<p>The<i> Solar Pump® </i>system combines a heat pump and a solar collector. The solar collector heats a water loop through sunlight and ambient temperature. Energy from the water loop heated is collected by the <i>Solar Pump®</i>, then transferred to storage balloons or a large aquatic mass such as a swimming pool. Through the solar collector, the <i>Solar Pump® </i>can run all day and night, regardless of weather conditions: sunshine, rain, heat air, condensation,... with outdoor temperatures down to 14°F (-10°C).</p>

Our Solar Pump® generator is a disruptive innovation in the renewable energy industry. Our unique system provides at a very low price hot water from solar energy. Our cost structure is low because our Solar Pump® power station technology delivers the energy of the future as soon as today: local solar energy available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and 365 days a year without intermittences.

According to academic research and industry survey, transporting energy from distant power plants represents up to 40% of energy total price. The energy produced by our Solar Pump® power stations is free of transport costs because the generators are located on clients’ sites: hotels, schools, hospitals, condos and soon private houses. They form an integral part of the buildings and are only dedicated to them.

This operational and energetic proximity explains why our price for each kWh is lower than our competitors – whether they operate in the renewable (photovoltaic, wind, wood, etc.), nuclear or fossil fuel industry.  


Lutexia - Cost comparison of useful kWh of energies available on the Energy Market VS our Solar Pump® power station

YOU DON'T PAY THE SOLAR PUMP® ITSELF (WE DO), JUST THE HOT WATER!

We finance and build the whole local power station in your building – on the roof and in your boiler room – or near of it but we keep the ownership. You don’t have to pay any rent. You just have to pay the hot water produced by the station at the lowest price ever seen.


WHY DO WE NEED FUNDING?
We need funding to build by March 2017 the first 100% US Solar Pump® system. Once the system built, we can install it in a first collective building in Florida in May 2017 and start our green business in the United States. Just remember that our future clients don't have to pay the Solar Pump® system, they only pay the hot water produced by the system.  




OUR UNIQUE AND SUCCESSFUL TECHNOLOGY:THE SOLAR PUMP® GENERATOR


Lutexia - Complete system
Based on a combination of the different types of Solar Pump® collectors and the various ways they can be integrated, the Solar Pump® system is an ecological and economical alternative to gas and other fossil fuels. With the great productivity of its solar collectors and its thermodynamic heart, the Solar Pump® generates a higher net energy balance than the other renewable power plants and is the world's most efficient solar water heater. 
With Solar Pump® systems, we deliver a  100% renewable energy hot water for less than hot water produced by the cheapest known energy (which is gas - a fossil fuel by the way) and with no release of CO2 into the atmosphere.
The Solar Pump® system combines a heat pump and a solar collector. The solar collector heats a water loop through sunlight and ambient temperature. Energy from the water loop heated is collected by the Solar Pump®, then transferred to storage balloons or a large aquatic mass such as a swimming pool. Through the solar collector, the Solar Pump® can run all day and night, regardless of weather conditions: sunshine, rain, heat air, condensation,... with outdoor temperatures down to 14°F (-10°C).



WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF THE SOLAR PUMP® SYSTEM?


 Cost effectiveness. Compared to most of traditional energy sources, such as fossil fuel, the energy produced by the Solar Pump® system is cheaper and operates highly competitive performance ratios. And you don't have to pay the Solar Pump® system, just the hot water produced by the system!


 Performance capacity. The Solar Pump® system can meet hot water needs of large communities and office buildings, with a production capacity of 400 to 5400 gallons (about 1,500 to 20,000 liters) of hot water a day.


 Simplicity. The Solar Pump® system is easy to maintain, use and install.  With its small size and low weight, a Solar Pump® unity can easily fit into a technical room. The Solar Pump® solar collectors are very light, can be installed vertically or horizontally on the roof and have a very limited architectural impact.





IS IT POSSIBLE TO INTEGRATE A SOLAR PUMP® SYSTEM IN A PRIVATE HOUSE ?


Not yet. We can install local power stations in local communities, schools, hospitals, condos, factories and other collective buildings but not in private houses. We are working on it but we are not ready. It's just a question of time and... money! That's why this crowdfunding campaign is so important for us. With your help, we can stop climate change and leave a greener planet to our children and grandchildren!


However we will send you very soon updates from our ongoing studies and works for the Private House Solar Pump ! We are working on it.

<h3>The Perks:</h3>
<div>Pretty self-explanatory.  ARti tools sent without gift boxes will be in poly bags.  If you are giving these as a gift, the gift box is a MUST.  The pocket pouches are a great way to carry your tool with the bullet pen, and I personally prefer to carry it this way.  Minimal printing through your pants, and the wedge shape fits perfectly in the corner of your pocket to keep them from moving around.  The pouches are included at my cost.  This will be the cheapest they'll ever be offered for.  The pens are really a great EDC pen and carrying them in the pouch is a great way to not lose them.</div>

<b>The ARti party:</b>  This will be EPIC.  The exact schedule is flexible.  If you'd like to spend the whole time getting some legit training, we can do that.  I can arrange training for beginners to experienced shooters.   If you'd like to train some pistol, some CQB rifle, and learn to shoot 1000 yards, then go blow stuff up, and then go shoot rabbits in the desert from a moving UTV with a full-auto rifle, I'm pretty sure I can set that up.  You tell me what you'd like to do and I'll do my best to arrange it.  I'll provide travel, hotel stay, ammo, training, rides, some meals, weapons that will be used, and safety equipment.  Depending on what you want, there may be an additional charge for extreme stuff.  I can make it more of a one-on-one setting with instructors, or I can arrange more people to be there and we can run some competition style drills against eachothers' times.  We can work around your schedule.  It will be worth the $5k.  I'm making 3 of them available.  If you have a group of 6, snag all of them!  <b>While this will be as explosively fun as possible, safety will always be the emphasis.</b>

</div><div><h3>What I need and why:</h3></div><div>I've already funded this first round of the ARti tool.  I can continue as-is with manufacturing and all will be fine, but I would love to be able to offer the ARti tool in a retail setting.  for that to happen, I'll need to reduce manufacturing costs by refining a few processes, purchasing materials in bulk, and invest in tooling for custom retail packaging.  This way I can offer retailers an attractive option while also (hopefully) lowering the end-user cost a little.  It will never be to where I'm offering it during this campaign, but can be a little lower than the current $44 MSRP.  </div><div>I also have a lot more ideas for some really cool and unique EDC gear that I would love to bring to market.  Unfortunately, I don't have the funding to do them all, so I need the ARti tool to be a success for this also.  I have years of experience in product development and have a lot of great contacts to get stuff done.  I just need the funding now to refine this current project and then be able to move forward with the next.  This is my first try with Indiegogo or any crowdfunding, and I promise that on my future projects, my previous campaign backers will ALWAYS have first-go at the best pricing options at the beginning of my campaigns.  I love titanium and many of my future projects will be titanium gadgets.  And not just multitools....  At some point during the middle of this campaign I'll release some prototype photos and drawings of my next project.  So, back the project because the ARti tool is awesome and know that by doing so, you're also helping my next EDC innovations come to light.</div><div><ul></ul></div><div>

3mm thick makes it very strong yet unobtrusive in your pocket.
Grade 5 titanium will hold up to use without ever corroding.  It also allows me to offer anodized options.
Shaped like America's favorite rifle, which will bring much admiration from your friends and their girlfriends as you pull it out to show them for the first time.

 


  
The ARti tool's Uses:
This list was deleted by the admin because it was too long.  That. Just. Happened.  Sooooo many uses.... Here are just a few:
 

         
            
   
 

The Perks:
Pretty self-explanatory.  ARti tools sent without gift boxes will be in poly bags.  If you are giving these as a gift, the gift box is a MUST.  The pocket pouches are a great way to carry your tool with the bullet pen, and I personally prefer to carry it this way.  Minimal printing through your pants, and the wedge shape fits perfectly in the corner of your pocket to keep them from moving around.  The pouches are included at my cost.  This will be the cheapest they'll ever be offered for.  The pens are really a great EDC pen and carrying them in the pouch is a great way to not lose them.

    
 
    


 


The ARti party:  This will be EPIC.  The exact schedule is flexible.  If you'd like to spend the whole time getting some legit training, we can do that.  I can arrange training for beginners to experienced shooters.   If you'd like to train some pistol, some CQB rifle, and learn to shoot 1000 yards, then go blow stuff up, and then go shoot rabbits in the desert from a moving UTV with a full-auto rifle, I'm pretty sure I can set that up.  You tell me what you'd like to do and I'll do my best to arrange it.  I'll provide travel, hotel stay, ammo, training, rides, some meals, weapons that will be used, and safety equipment.  Depending on what you want, there may be an additional charge for extreme stuff.  I can make it more of a one-on-one setting with instructors, or I can arrange more people to be there and we can run some competition style drills against eachothers' times.  We can work around your schedule.  It will be worth the $5k.  I'm making 3 of them available.  If you have a group of 6, snag all of them!  While this will be as explosively fun as possible, safety will always be the emphasis.

 
What I need and why:I've already funded this first round of the ARti tool.  I can continue as-is with manufacturing and all will be fine, but I would love to be able to offer the ARti tool in a retail setting.  for that to happen, I'll need to reduce manufacturing costs by refining a few processes, purchasing materials in bulk, and invest in tooling for custom retail packaging.  This way I can offer retailers an attractive option while also (hopefully) lowering the end-user cost a little.  It will never be to where I'm offering it during this campaign, but can be a little lower than the current $44 MSRP.  I also have a lot more ideas for some really cool and unique EDC gear that I would love to bring to market.  Unfortunately, I don't have the funding to do them all, so I need the ARti tool to be a success for this also.  I have years of experience in product development and have a lot of great contacts to get stuff done.  I just need the funding now to refine this current project and then be able to move forward with the next.  This is my first try with Indiegogo or any crowdfunding, and I promise that on my future projects, my previous campaign backers will ALWAYS have first-go at the best pricing options at the beginning of my campaigns.  I love titanium and many of my future projects will be titanium gadgets.  And not just multitools....  At some point during the middle of this campaign I'll release some prototype photos and drawings of my next project.  So, back the project because the ARti tool is awesome and know that by doing so, you're also helping my next EDC innovations come to light.
 

 



 

 

**The ARti tools pictured are prototypes.  The final versions will be only very slightly different.  Some of the unnecessary sharp edges will be slightly rounded-off, making it easier to handle without getting gouged.  The ""titanium blasted finish"" is shown on all of the photos below.",24.0,0,"1 Campaign

Our price structure will compete directly with airline economy class, and undercut business and of course first class airline services while offering an equivalent level of service and luxury, not to mention other forms of road and rail travel. Our emphasis will be on smaller regional markets and their nearby major metropolitan neighbors, with the first two years focusing on Northern California, Oregon and Washington States.While limited travel options and/or problematic airlines with multiple stopover or connections leave customers stranded in aircraft and/or in airport lounges for hours at a time, we offer a viable and safe alternative for Regional Travel and Getaway Packages throughout the Northwest region. With Mundara you will be able to reach those Metropolitan neighbors or visa versa, that in many cases are a mere few hours apart, by luxury road travel, refreshed and ready for your planned stay.Initial services focusing on the San Francisco Bay Area to Rogue Valley of Southern Oregon (home of the world famous Shakespeare and the Brit Festivals) markets, and the leg from the same Rogue valley in Southern Oregon to Portland at the northern end of our state. Mundara Platinum Travel will be the premier source for luxury, feature packed travel in our chosen market. One trip on one of our mini coaches, experience the luxury, technology and concierge drop off and you will be a customer for life. Our service is a one of a kind, luxury service with full technology access for the ultimate in productivity and entertainment. Being a ground based express style service, we are not restricted by the pitfalls of airlines, and other ground based options (such as Greyhound), weather traumas such as heavy fog, storms and inbound aircraft delays.What We Need & What You GetWe need between $30,000 and $50,000 to get things rolling, these funds will be in addition to the financing for the bulk of our first bus which is in progress. If we do not reach the full goal, we are well within our means of getting the business off the ground. However, being a start-up, of course, every dollar matters. We will also be raising funds through pre-sale of tickets up to 90 days in advance of vehicle delivery.In appreciation, you have the option of receiving a custom T-Shirt to celebrate the launch of a soon to be great american business icon,Travel mugs featuring our company, for use on your trips with us and more importantly, gift certificates and one way, or round trip tickets to and from the Rogue valley in Oregon or the San Francisco Bay area on our luxury coaches.Lastly we offer for larger business supporters the opportunity to design your own day out featuring our luxury busses, whether its a trip to the Napa Valley, Yosemite or Crater Lake in Oregon.

</div><p>Hello Contributors, </p>
<p>My name is Erica and I am a student at Concordia University.
I am studying to get my degree in Emergency Management, under the Homeland
Security program. I am passionate about community resiliency and the power of
providing our communities with the tools needed to help us all fare well when disaster
strikes.</p>
<p>My campaign is to create an app that will help develop
community resiliency. It will have the ability to calculate how much supplies
you and your family, including pet family, need within your designated number
of survival days. It will have a calendar function that lets you know what to
purchase each week to build up your resiliency supplies. Eventually I would
like to add a GPS feature that will tell you where to find emergency supplies
and help based on your location. Like where the closest hospital, pharmacy and
grocery stores are to you. </p>
<p>This will help us and our communities become self-sufficient
in an emergency situation. It is better to be prepared and not need it then to
be not prepared and without support as we have seen all too often when natural
disasters strike.</p>
<p>Here is the cost breakdown and why I need so much to get
this app to be all it can be for you!</p>
<p>Blueprint: $10,000-$15,000</p>
<p>Design: $10,000</p>
<p><b>Development: (Ballparks)</b></p>
<p>- iPhone App:
$15,000-$25,000</p>
<p>- Server/Backend:
$5,000-$15,000</p>
<p>Ongoing (Hosting/Support) -
$1,250/mo.</p>
<p>If I get more than I need I will work to have this app be
created for an Android environment too! If I don’t get enough, then the funds
will go toward the beginning stages of the iPhone app and I will try to find
other funding sources.</p>

Please share this fundraiser with all your
family and friends! Help make it happen so that we can all have a tool to help
us prepare for the unexpected.<p></p></div>","Hello Contributors,

<h3>Mind Blown.</h3>
<p>2014. After 15 months of production and working with people in the sustainability field such as environmentalist, Bill McKibben, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, Mark Z. Jacobson, Eco-Philosopher, Joanna Macy and walking with 400 thousand people at The People's Climate March in NYC,  Brett knew he wanted to build an eco-friendly, sustainable village that people could come, unplug and have an immersive experience in a unique environment that takes participants out of their everyday box.   </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498500978/dr07vsmpwzwzhtgwaimf.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Two years later, Brett linked up with award winning Architectural Firm Penda to create a design that blends Modern tech with Cultural Wisdom. CEO, Chris Precht, and his team came up with a unique one of a kind modular design based on Native American teepees built with bamboo, rope and recycled materials that allow the structure to become an element that eventually grows into the environment.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498501058/elxqbuvtfdssk9vwjncr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Brett and his partner Kylie moved to Ecuador to build the dream. The team broke ground in December 2016 and are now in the last stages of completing this one of a kind structure.  It will have 5 bedrooms, sleep 6-12 comfortably and has a third-floor yoga studio with ocean views.  When Wild Child Village is complete, it will feature solar, water harvesting, a grey water system, compost toilets, organic gardens, a food forest and a beautiful yoga studio.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498501099/yzj1oaviihwks96gpfcp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Brett and Kylie are now reaching out to like-minded individuals who believe in sustainable projects and paying it forward with this IndieGoGo campaign. The goal is to have everyone come and experience Wild Child Village for themselves.  As perks, the team has created some fun adventures and transformative retreats with some of their talented friends! </p>

<h3>Why Ecuador?</h3>
<p>Ecuador is one of the most biodiverse countries in the world. The Andes, Amazon Rainforest, Highlands and the Galapagos Islands are four diverse and unique regions within the country, not to mention the surf is awesome too.  </p>
<p>Brett fell in love with the charming surf town of Ayampe four years ago while on a surf trip with his cousin. He has gone back every year since and is now making the dream of owning land and building a sustainable project a reality.</p>
<p>Wild Child Village is rooted on the edge of a rainforest in La Reserve Manabi, a 70-acre Eco-Community in the hills above Ayampe. With views of the ocean and mountains, the village is discretely tucked in the canyon for privacy, solitude, and room to grow.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498507299/i0rsefhca1qg5sh9ydny.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>Community Impact:</h3>
<p>Ayampe is known for its conscious community, strong local comuna, and magical tranquility. Wild Child Village is building sustainable connections with the residents of the surrounding villages, recognizing that unity is a fundamental part of being ‘sustainable’. By fostering meaningful interaction between the local Ayampe community and WCV’s international community, WCV aims to:</p>
<p>- Co-create a sustainable and prosperous Ayampe, based on existing Ecuadorian values and societal characteristics</p>
<p>- Promote the best of Ecuador – its people, culture, the arts and local ingenuity</p>
<p>- Nurture a deeper understanding of our home in Ayampe through active participation in language, local rituals, cultural events, art, and music</p>
<p>- Promote unity and peace through mutual understanding, shared experiences and shared values</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498505539/numjgm5d7owwdfglgn5p.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Giving Back:</h3>
<p>Most children in Ayampe and neighboring areas have a basic level of education with no extracurricular activities or programs. Imagine all the potential and genius that could be revealed with a little inspiration and mentoring.  </p>
<p>WILD SPIRITS will be an After School Program (July - November) in association with the Waldorf schools that will open up new possibilities for the youth of Ayampe and help nurture hidden talents and passions through the creative arts, healing arts, sustainability, cooking, music, dance and leadership classes. With local and international teachers, students will have access to new creative outlets, new understandings and an open door to a new world view. Wild Child Village will be a campus which ignites the senses and the natural curiosity of its students. A place where innovation, creativity, and learning flourish. A community which has come together from all corners of the globe to share new experiences and knowledge.</p>

</div></div>","Mind Blown.
2014. After 15 months of production and working with people in the sustainability field such as environmentalist, Bill McKibben, professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, Mark Z. Jacobson, Eco-Philosopher, Joanna Macy and walking with 400 thousand people at The People's Climate March in NYC,  Brett knew he wanted to build an eco-friendly, sustainable village that people could come, unplug and have an immersive experience in a unique environment that takes participants out of their everyday box.   

Two years later, Brett linked up with award winning Architectural Firm Penda to create a design that blends Modern tech with Cultural Wisdom. CEO, Chris Precht, and his team came up with a unique one of a kind modular design based on Native American teepees built with bamboo, rope and recycled materials that allow the structure to become an element that eventually grows into the environment.  

Brett and his partner Kylie moved to Ecuador to build the dream. The team broke ground in December 2016 and are now in the last stages of completing this one of a kind structure.  It will have 5 bedrooms, sleep 6-12 comfortably and has a third-floor yoga studio with ocean views.  When Wild Child Village is complete, it will feature solar, water harvesting, a grey water system, compost toilets, organic gardens, a food forest and a beautiful yoga studio.

Brett and Kylie are now reaching out to like-minded individuals who believe in sustainable projects and paying it forward with this IndieGoGo campaign. The goal is to have everyone come and experience Wild Child Village for themselves.  As perks, the team has created some fun adventures and transformative retreats with some of their talented friends!

$80,000

Why Ecuador?
Ecuador is one of the most biodiverse countries in the world. The Andes, Amazon Rainforest, Highlands and the Galapagos Islands are four diverse and unique regions within the country, not to mention the surf is awesome too.  
Brett fell in love with the charming surf town of Ayampe four years ago while on a surf trip with his cousin. He has gone back every year since and is now making the dream of owning land and building a sustainable project a reality.
Wild Child Village is rooted on the edge of a rainforest in La Reserve Manabi, a 70-acre Eco-Community in the hills above Ayampe. With views of the ocean and mountains, the village is discretely tucked in the canyon for privacy, solitude, and room to grow.


Community Impact:
Ayampe is known for its conscious community, strong local comuna, and magical tranquility. Wild Child Village is building sustainable connections with the residents of the surrounding villages, recognizing that unity is a fundamental part of being ‘sustainable’. By fostering meaningful interaction between the local Ayampe community and WCV’s international community, WCV aims to:
- Co-create a sustainable and prosperous Ayampe, based on existing Ecuadorian values and societal characteristics
- Promote the best of Ecuador – its people, culture, the arts and local ingenuity
- Nurture a deeper understanding of our home in Ayampe through active participation in language, local rituals, cultural events, art, and music
- Promote unity and peace through mutual understanding, shared experiences and shared values

Giving Back:
Most children in Ayampe and neighboring areas have a basic level of education with no extracurricular activities or programs. Imagine all the potential and genius that could be revealed with a little inspiration and mentoring.  
WILD SPIRITS will be an After School Program (July - November) in association with the Waldorf schools that will open up new possibilities for the youth of Ayampe and help nurture hidden talents and passions through the creative arts, healing arts, sustainability, cooking, music, dance and leadership classes. With local and international teachers, students will have access to new creative outlets, new understandings and an open door to a new world view. Wild Child Village will be a campus which ignites the senses and the natural curiosity of its students. A place where innovation, creativity, and learning flourish. A community which has come together from all corners of the globe to share new experiences and knowledge.

My wife and kids had all gone back to the room for the day, and I decided to stay out on the beach and do some snorkeling. Before heading out into the water, I put my phone, earbuds, and cash in my shoe, which I covered with a towel and left on a beach chair. I swam out about 100 yards, and when I looked back to shore, I saw an individual shuffling through my stuff on the beach, and then walk away with something in his hand. I yelled to him, and swam back to shore as fast as I could, but by the time I got there, both he and my stuff were gone. This was a real downer for the vacation, and I decided that I needed a solution to prevent something like this from ever happening again.</p><p> </p><div data-id=""5345495""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1463498121/rdrmrxuyysvvdo01bnxc.png"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><p>When I got back to the states, I began my search for a solution to the problem. To me, the problem was more complex than just a way to prevent my personal items from being stolen when I was at the beach. I had a whole list of requirements for this product I was seeking. First and foremost, I wanted a way carry my personal items that would enable me to securely fasten them to a stationary object so they couldn’t be tampered with or stolen. In my mind, this would require a locking mechanism that couldn’t be broken, cut, or torn, and the container itself also needed to be made of something that was resistant to cutting or tearing. I basically wanted a product that would be impenetrable to thieves of all kinds, including protecting my credit cards and passports that contained RFID chips from unauthorized scanning (digital pick-pocketing). Conversely, I wanted something stylish, attractive, and functional — something that would seamlessly fit into my everyday life, that I would enjoy using and be proud to be seen using. More and more, this was sounding to me like some kind of a bag. </p><p>That’s what I needed — an everyday “go to” bag that would meet all my technical requirements, and still be soft, foldable/packable, comfortable, highly functional, attractive and fashionable, and durable — and one that would clear my ultimate hurdle -- being able to get my wife to carry it. That shouldn’t be hard to find, I thought. Well, it was. In fact there was no product on the market that was even remotely close to what I was looking for. After exhausting my search, I began the process of creating the bag I was seeking. It took hundreds of hours of research, and countless prototypes and failed attempts. In the end, we have created a product that will blow your mind. Bags that are soft and beautiful, packed with features, and insanely durable. Some people say that our products are overkill, and that we must be over-compensating for something. Maybe. </p><p>-<i>Don Halpern</i></p><div data-id=""5447801""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/v1463498122/j74h9go0mhjtxbhsreyn.png"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div><div data-id=""5506064""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://loctote.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/donadam-1.gif"" src="""" style=""""/></figure></div><p> </p><p>We're Don and Adam.

Some thieves stole our work and created a very inferior knock-off of LOCTOTE based on what they could learn from our website and crowdfunding campaigns. They cut corners, used inferior components, and they missed or ignored many of the critical design and construction details. Their product will not hold-up or perform like a true LOCTOTE. Assuming they ever ship product (not sure they will), their product will greatly disappoint customers, so time will sort them out. Support the original LOCTOTE and help these thieves to perish.

Our purpose for creating this bag really is that simple. This product lets you live more and worry less.

Unfortunately, my wife cannot say the same thing about my approach for testing softness…   This is the bag you’ll want to take with you everywhere like a trusted friend. They are lightweight, comfortable to carry, foldable, packable, crushable, wrinkle-resistant, hand-washable, UV resistant, latex and gluten free, and handcrafted. Whether you’re dressed for the office, the gym, the beach, or a night out — LOCTOTE™ bags are a soft reliable friend that will protect your stuff from thieves, and you from bland accessories.  When you start with a blank sheet of paper you get to re-think everything. That’s what we did with this bag. We considered the best way and the best materials each step along the way. We purposefully over-engineered, over-designed, and over-built. Nothing was left to chance, and in the end we created a product that is functional, packed with features and built to last. 
One-piece construction eliminates bottom seam blow-out
Oversized swivel trigger-snap key clip keeps your keys secure and handy llll
Leather LOCTOTE™ badge doubles as a pocket to conveniently store your lock or ID 
Heavy-duty UV resistant bonded polyester thread used throughout the bag ensures strength even after repeated use and prolonged exposure to the sun 
Custom-made double-braided nylon yacht rope is flexible, strong, and pleasant to the touch 
Customizable 3-digit lock combination
Lock-stitched drawstring ropes always stay even and balanced

 
 We started from the ground up. We were inspired by the functional simplicity of Mid-Century Minimalism, the freedom of thought and disregard for existing rules of Abstract Expressionism, and the innovation, strength, and enduring quality of Vintage Heavy Industry.    We thought through everything and skimped on nothing. We did things to test our bags that didn’t make our moms proud (and possibly violated a few city ordinances). Good enough wasn’t good enough. We saw beauty in strength and elegance in simplicity. We got in touch with our softer side, and we kept innovating until we got it right. At the end of it all, we created a product that we think will blow your mind.
  
 We are a small employee-owned company located in the heartland of America. We still believe in the American dream and the values that industrialized our nation and made it great — quality and craftsmanship forged from the sweat and labor of strong dedicated workers who take pride in their trade while creating innovative products that improve lives. We scour the globe to find the absolute best and most technologically advanced materials and manufacturers available. We compromise on nothing when it comes to quality and authenticity, and cut no corners in crafting goods built to outlive their owners. There’s nothing fancy and no secret formula to what we do. We’re just hands-on hard-working folks providing customers handcrafted hard-wearing products at a fair price. It’s really quite simple.  The idea behind LOCTOTE came as a result of a family vacation in St. Croix. My wife and kids had all gone back to the room for the day, and I decided to stay out on the beach and do some snorkeling. Before heading out into the water, I put my phone, earbuds, and cash in my shoe, which I covered with a towel and left on a beach chair. I swam out about 100 yards, and when I looked back to shore, I saw an individual shuffling through my stuff on the beach, and then walk away with something in his hand. I yelled to him, and swam back to shore as fast as I could, but by the time I got there, both he and my stuff were gone. This was a real downer for the vacation, and I decided that I needed a solution to prevent something like this from ever happening again.  When I got back to the states, I began my search for a solution to the problem. To me, the problem was more complex than just a way to prevent my personal items from being stolen when I was at the beach. I had a whole list of requirements for this product I was seeking. First and foremost, I wanted a way carry my personal items that would enable me to securely fasten them to a stationary object so they couldn’t be tampered with or stolen. In my mind, this would require a locking mechanism that couldn’t be broken, cut, or torn, and the container itself also needed to be made of something that was resistant to cutting or tearing. I basically wanted a product that would be impenetrable to thieves of all kinds, including protecting my credit cards and passports that contained RFID chips from unauthorized scanning (digital pick-pocketing). Conversely, I wanted something stylish, attractive, and functional — something that would seamlessly fit into my everyday life, that I would enjoy using and be proud to be seen using. More and more, this was sounding to me like some kind of a bag. That’s what I needed — an everyday “go to” bag that would meet all my technical requirements, and still be soft, foldable/packable, comfortable, highly functional, attractive and fashionable, and durable — and one that would clear my ultimate hurdle -- being able to get my wife to carry it. That shouldn’t be hard to find, I thought. Well, it was. In fact there was no product on the market that was even remotely close to what I was looking for. After exhausting my search, I began the process of creating the bag I was seeking. It took hundreds of hours of research, and countless prototypes and failed attempts. In the end, we have created a product that will blow your mind. Bags that are soft and beautiful, packed with features, and insanely durable. Some people say that our products are overkill, and that we must be over-compensating for something. Maybe. -Don Halpern We're Don and Adam. No special roles or fancy titles here.

LeveTop acts as your third arm, so you can capture hands-free footage in any setting.Whether you’re at the beach, in the park, or simply walking around, LeveTop will hover precisely in place for still, crisp angles and views that don’t exclude anyone or anything in the background. A user friendly app makes piloting so easy all you have to do is tap your phone screen once. LeveTop’s iPhone & Android friendly app makes it easy to take off and land in one click. In fact, LeveTop’s precision positioning technology makes smart landing so smart, it’ll actually return to the same spot you took off.In the case you come across an emergency, such as flying into a crowd, trees or buildings, simply click the Emergency button and all four propellers will stop. LeveTop will lose power and will safely return to the ground avoiding any damage.Pilot your drone by simply tilting your smartphone.  Simply tilt left and watch LeveTop move left. Tilt right, and LeveTop will go right. How does it work you ask?When you tilt your smartphone LeveTop collects instant vector data (including speed and direction) through it's onboard G-sensor. LeveTop receives this information via it’s specific WiFi frequency, the onboard computer will process it and then send orders to change the direction by changing the speed of each spinning propeller. LeveTop uses its Six-Axis Accelerometer+Three-Axis Gyro to balance itself the entire time.Preset LeveTop to track and follow you autonomously using GPS and vision positioning. You can pilot LeveTop conveniently and effortlessly anywhere you want to go. With our new GPS and vision precise positioning technology, LeveTop can follow whoever automatically.

LeveTop will stay in the boundary you've chosen, allowing everyone from beginners to experts to practice their piloting skills with confidence.  
Each of LeveTop’s four arms fold into its body for easy storage and portability no matter what the occasion. LeveTop evolved from the frustration that despite there being many small drones on the market, none of them combined all the fun features of a personal smart drone and were also easy to carry.Either the drone is too big, the camera mount is exposed (making it delicate and vulnerable to damage), or the drone is too small and you’ve sacrificed all of the really awesome features for size.LeveTop combines all the functions into one unique and lightweight folding frame, which allows you to carry it easily everywhere you go.Place LeveTop inside its case for protection and attach it to your waist for one less thing to carry in your hands.Protect your LeveTop from scratches and damage by opting to add it's carry case.Because of its unique foldable design, LeveTop is much more portable than the smaller sized drones like Micro Drone and Kudrone. It's compact black & red carry case easily attaches to your waist so you keep your hands free and can cruise around in style.Wherever you’re travelling to next or even a staycation spent around town locally, take LeveTop with you and don’t stress over the extra carrying hassle.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey! My name is Steven and I will be cycling across the country with Bike &amp; Build in an effort to create awareness and involvement in Affordable Housing.</p>
<p>Prior to the trip, I will be fundraising $4500 which will all be donated to Affordable Housing projects across the US such as Habitat for Humanity among others.</p>
<p>I will then bike the 3600+ miles from Nags Head, NC to San Diego, CA in 70 days spreading awareness for Affordable Housing in communities along the way.</p>
<p>At certain cities and towns I will stop to spend a day building homes with Habitat for Humanity for a total of 104 hours by the time it's all said and done.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>$4500 will be raised and all will be donated to Affordable Housing projects across the US.</p>
<p>So why am I only asking for $2500?? Well I will be taking the funds raised here and donating them through a corporation that will match my donation. $2500 then becomes $5000 via corporate matching!</p>
<p>Well that's more than $4500?? Well yeah but indiegogo takes 6-9% of all donations so when it's all said and done, the final will be closer to $4500.  </p>
<p>For your donation there will be great perks ranging from postcards from my journey, all the way to a 2-day accommodation to party with us as we dip our tires in San Diego at the end of our trip!</p>

My name is Andy DiBiaso. I'm an American, living in Montreal, QC, with my wife, three small sons, and pug. I've been working in home renovations and construction for about ten years now. With every year that passes, I've felt more and more the desire to go use my skills for the benefit of those in great need. This year, the opportunity arose to do just that in the Philippians, and so here I am.<br/></p><p>I'll be leaving from Montreal, Canada for the Philippines (Manilla and Tacloban) on January 24th with two friends to volunteer with a Philippines based charity that works to end poverty through building new homes and self sustaining communities for those in need.

I'm an American, living in Montreal, QC, with my wife, three small sons, and pug. I've been working in home renovations and construction for about ten years now. With every year that passes, I've felt more and more the desire to go use my skills for the benefit of those in great need. This year, the opportunity arose to do just that in the Philippians, and so here I am.I'll be leaving from Montreal, Canada for the Philippines (Manilla and Tacloban) on January 24th with two friends to volunteer with a Philippines based charity that works to end poverty through building new homes and self sustaining communities for those in need. We'll be returning on February 8th.We'll be first helping out on a community rebuild near Manilla, and then in Tacloban. We'll be doing anything and everything that we can (within the safety guidelines) as far as clearing debris, or helping with the construction of new homes for those who lost everything. Air fare to from Montreal to Manilla has been generously provided, but we still need funds for things like:- vaccinations- food- sleeping accommodations- a small flight from Manilla to Tacloban.(the hardest hit by the Typhoon)Right now, we need about 600 to 700 dollars. This is a great and tangible way to impact lives in the Philippians NOW. We all felt a desire to do SOMETHING when we saw the what Typhoon Haiyan left in its wake. Everyone can't go, but I'm fortunate to have the freedom and time to do so.

BULLET is the smallest LED flashlight on the market. Period. Providing you a powerful punch in a small package. It all started when I needed a flashlight one evening after I dropped my phone under my car. I immediately needed a light but did not have one. I thought to myself, ""It would be great to have a flashlight, but the size of a bullet.""Inspired by the 9mm round.A sleek, minimal, and beautiful design, we present to you BULLET, providing a strong LED mini flashlight in its most minimal form, while eliminating bulky flashlights from your everyday carry. Minimize your life. Everyday Carry Done RightWe believe that your everyday carry items are a reflection of you and your lifestyle. BULLET’S functionality, beauty, and minimalism make it the best everyday carry tiny LED flashlight available. The easiest way to carry your flashlight is on your keys! Save the space in your pockets for what truly matters.  A quick quarter rotation on the head of the BULLET to turn it on, and a quick rotation back to turn it off. We wanted to get rid of unnecessary buttons to keep it slick and precise. A built in key chain allows you to carry BULLET with you everywhere you go.Bullet clipped on a backpack.Available in Matte Black, Gunmetal, and now Blue!We took the smallest, sleekest possible design, and combined it with aircraft-grade aluminum and an anodized finish to bring you a powerful tiny LED light, perfect for everyday use. We believe that the shape, and size kept the design minimal, functional and easy to carry, completely hassle-free in any situation.Measuring in at an incredible 10.5mm x 30mm and weighing only 6 grams, BULLET is the perfect size flashlight for modern day wear. Powered by three LR41 Button Cell batteries to produce 15 lumens of light, keep it with you at all times, anywhere you go. Why BULLET?We like keeping things simple, and easy to carry around everywhere you go. What makes us different? We eliminate the bulk, weight, and hassle from traditional everyday carry flashlights, creating a seamless experience for you every single day. Compared to other alternatives, the choice is simple.Designed with aerospace-grade aluminum and a sleek anodized finish, the BULLET is built for any situation possible. Rain, sleet, hail, snow, the BULLET will illuminate in any weather, helping solve any problem. An LED light is ideal for everyday use over a long period of time. Never worry about breaking the light, since no glass or filament is used, or replacing it, since LEDs can last a lifetime. Battery's also last much longer with LED light, saving you both time and money in the long haul. What is an LED you ask? Well, for all you who don’t know, LED’s are the most efficient kind of light bulbs out on the market today. One small bulb can last you anywhere from 25,000 to 100,000 hours. Of course you'll still have to replace the batteries periodically.We went through many iterations, finishes, and housings for the design of BULLET.We decided to use the bottom twist due to the leverage provided by the key ring. By holding onto the keyring, twisting to turn on was easiest. Furthermore, the triangle ring offered increased stability when on a keychain.Original Prototype Rendering 1Original Prototype Rendering 2Original Prototype Rendering 3SPECIFICATIONS

started off amazing. Not a cloud in the sky, the margaritas were flowing and the music was just right. After a few drinks, we decided to hop in the pool and go for a quick swim. Without hesitation, we took our valuables and put them in our shoes which we then tucked under our lounge chairs. Although we were a little concerned, we figured what are the chances that someone is going to steal our stuff. It's a gamble that everyone takes and has accepted as a common concern. Even though we were continuously watching our lounge chairs and thought we always had at least once person monitoring our stuff, when we came back, everything was gone.</p><p>It was very simple, we became victims to a crime that happens every single day at beaches and pools around the world. Why there has never been a solution to this problem was simply mind-blowing to us. After the police reports, dealing with hotel security, watching everyone else have fun in the sun while we sat there and blamed ourselves for being so naive and getting robbed, the idea came to us for creating a portable safe that attaches to your lounge chair. Fast forward a few years after we invented our first product and realized how successful it became, we decided to challenge ourselves and create the BEST Portable Safe you have ever seen.</p><p>We spent years looking for the right materials and assembling the best factories to help create our vision. At this point, all the preparation has been done and now all we need is you. With your help, we can bring our vision to life and deliver a product that so many people around the world have asked for and can benefit from. We can't think of a single person that cannot use this product in some way, shape or form.
