<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hailing from Oslo, Norway, the dystopian sludge//doom metal trio <strong>RONGEUR</strong> was formed in the autumn of 2012. The experienced band members came together with few limitations regarding sound or genre, except a shared desire to make raw, heavy and honest music. Rongeur therefore offer varying levels of angst and batter you with their unique brand of heavy. They draw inspiration from the likes of Eyehategod, Seigmen, High on Fire, Neurosis, Darkthrone and Arthur Schoupenhauer.</p>
<p>Check out Rongeur here: </p>
<p><a href=""https://rongeur.bandcamp.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://rongeur.bandcamp.com/</a> </p>
<p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Rongeurband/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/Rongeurband/</a></p>
<p><strong>Past</strong><br/>Rongeur's first release was a compilation of demos, ""The Catastrophist"" (2013) and ""As the Blind Strive"" (2014), issued on cassette by the british label Aonair Productions in 2014, and later on compact disc by the norwegian label Disiplin Media in 2015. The release received great feedback from several reviewers worldwide. Later in 2015 Rongeur also released a digital split with Ampmandens Døtre (Rongeur contributing two tracks, ""Nothing Has Improved""/""Traitors""). A two-track 7'' vinyl single ""God and I""/""Good War"" was then released in 2016. Both these releases were mixed and mastered by Jørgen Karlstrøm (ex-Hexed), and issued on the norwegian label Ampmandens Records. </p>
<p><strong>Present</strong><br/>Their debut full length LP <strong>""An Asphyxiating Embrace""</strong> was recorded at Norsk Lydstudio in late January 2017 with vocals and dubbing done elsewhere throughout 2017. Mixing and mastering was done by Ruben Willem at Caliban Studios (Haust, Okkultokrati, Nettlecarrier, Timeworn, Djevel).</p>
<p>The new effort is released digitally and on cassette tape on <strong>9th of March 2018</strong>, and sees Rongeur perfecting their form of angry sludge//doom metal. Lyrically they still struggle with alienation, loss and general misanthropy.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Poacher Records is a small DIY label run by the band themselves. There is thus limited funds available. The recording, mixing, and mastering is done, and has been financed by the band. The vinyl edition of the album will be co-released with Aonair Records and Ampmandens Records. However, Poacher Records and the band still has to shoulder the majority of the manufacturing costs. Shipping of the vinyl is estimated to begin in <strong>early June 2018</strong>.      </p>
<ul>
<li>We are asking for EUR 1000 as a goal.  This will help pay for about half of the manufacturing costs, in addition to the licencing fees, taxes, postage, etc.</li>
<li>We offer the album <strong>""An Asphyxiating Embrace""</strong> in a limited run of three different vinyl colours: clear, white or standard black vinyl (100 copies of each colour). The LP is housed in a beautiful single jacket cover design by Ole Nymoen Design (Sibiir, Naga Siren, Hexed, Ieatheartattacks), with a high quality protective inner sleeve.  </li>
<li>​All copies of the LP will be hand numbered by the band.</li>
<li>20 copies of the coloured vinyl versions will contain a signed live band photo by Endre Lohne + a spot on the guest list to a Rongeur concert in Oslo in late summer 2018 (date/time: TBA).</li>
<li>​For the die-hard fans, we also offer a bundle with an extremely limited test pressing of the album + other limited goodies.</li>
<li>Furthermore, we offer a bundle including the vinyl version of your choice, in addition to a copy of a very limited run of 50 hand numbered cassette tapes of the album, with exclusive artwork and a bonus track.</li>
<li>​If we exceed our goal, we will consider adding more stuff to the packages.</li>
<li>Shipping will be added at checkout. Please observe that the shipping prices listed is set by the norwegian postal service. </li>
<li>If you live in the Oslo area, or have friends here, we can arrange for local pick up if desired. Then select ""Pitcairn"" as shipping destination at checkout. You will then not be charged any shipping fees. If you order from Pitcairn however you are very lucky as you will get free shipping!</li>

<h3><strong>Short Summary </strong></h3>Launched in 2011, Brasil Summerfest (BSF) has grown to be the largest international Brazilian music &amp; arts festival in the world. We have presented some of the most exciting artists from Brazil including <strong>Seu Jorge, Elza Soares, Marcelo D2, Criolo, Emicida, Lenine</strong> and many others. We have been shaping Brazilian contemporary culture in New York and developing BSF as a landmark event in New York’s festival circuit. We are looking to extend BSF to two weeks filled with exciting music performances, films, workshops, parties, talks and a street fair featuring a variety of vendors. We want to turn BSF into an invigorating 360 Brazilian experience! <p> </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>Our goal is to raise $10,000. Half of the funds will go towards helping the artists with their visa expenses, flights and lodging. We’re talking about 40+ musicians flying from Brazil to NYC. The other half of the funds will go towards festival production and staffing. It takes a village to put the festival together — a lot of time, energy and resources. To help us achieve our mission, we have put together some very special perks that you won’t find anywhere else! Get yourself a great perk and in return, you’ll also get yourself an amazing festival! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p>This year we want to create the biggest edition of our festival to date. We want to bring 15 truly unique bands from Brazil.  We want to expand our program to include workshops, talks, films, food and much more! We want to create a Brazilian experience the world will envy. We are on our way and you can help us get there! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p>We always deliver what we promise, but sometimes unpredictable things can happen. The greatest challenge is getting the artists that we love from Brazil to NYC. Sometimes the artists don’t have enough resources to make the trip or to file for visas, but this is exactly part of the purpose of this campaign. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>Help us by sharing this with your friends, family and community. Do it online and offline. Thank you so much for your support. Muito Obrigado pelo seu apoio. See you at Brasil Summerfest 2018! </p>

<h3>Project Breakdown</h3>
<p>From the heart of downtown Los Angeles, Marc Avery, Sean Carney, and Rockwell Sands came together in the fall of 2016 to form what they thought “the ultimate project” would be: a band with pop sensibilities that married urban and rock music into one unique sound.</p>
<p>WOLVES have been around for just under two years, and in that time, they have climbed Billboard and Mediabase charts, appeared on Sirius XM's ""Hit's 1"" station, played on radio stations across the country and played many live shows in the Los Angeles area at legendary venues such as Hotel Cafe and the Viper Room. The guys have accomplished all of this through consistent hard-work and determination, and the unconditional support of their fans.</p>
<p>""Freaky"" is a song that throws all caution to the wind. WOLVES plan on making a memorable statement with this song which celebrates individuality, courage and fun! The band hopes to raise spirits by allowing the listener to embrace the qualities that make us unique, and let that freak flag fly.</p>
<p>With your support, WOLVES will be able to create an original audio-visual work in the way that they've always imagined it. They will be able to collaborate with some of the most talented film-makers in Los Angeles and let the message of ""Freaky"" be heard through carefully planned promotion. The guys know that this song has the potential to change lives and that is why they are so enthusiastic about this project.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Here are the fine details of what we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most of this money will go directly toward making this video. We will need:<ul>
<li>A director</li>
<li>A team of filmogrpahers</li>
<li>A few locations</li>
<li>A video editor</li>
<li>Costumes</li>
<li>A cast of actors</li>
<li>Set design</li>
<li>Secret sauce</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A good amount of this will go towards a PR campaign with one of the best publicists in Los Angeles. This will get us exclusive access to:<ul>
<li>Spotify playlists</li>
<li>Blog/Magazine reviews</li>
<li>Airtime on radio stations</li>
<li>Music video placement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We've also allocated a budget to go towards additional marketing and producing merchandise for our backers.</li>
</ul>
<p>If for whatever reason we don't meet our goal, we will use the funds collected to make the music video anyway. This song is just TOO GOOD.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The men of WOLVES have shared a dream since they started working together to make music that inspires people with a positive message. The band understands the raw power of music and the impact that it can have on peoples lives. Your contribution could help WOLVES reach their goal of reaching a much bigger audience and touching the lives of many people who may need to hear this song.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge for us right now is funding our passion. We dream really big, almost to a fault, but we wouldn't have it any other way. We understand that to create the best art possible, it takes involvement of experts in every field. The video for ""Freaky"" will involve some seriously talented artists...and they need to make a living too. By supporting us, you are supporting them to get to the next level as well.</p>
<p>The music industry is one of the toughest places to succeed, and we find many artists who are in it for all the wrong reasons. From the bottom of our hearts, all we want to do is make people understand one another and bring the world together through music.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

From the heart of downtown Los Angeles, Marc Avery, Sean Carney, and Rockwell Sands came together in the fall of 2016 to form what they thought “the ultimate project” would be: a band with pop sensibilities that married urban and rock music into one unique sound.
WOLVES have been around for just under two years, and in that time, they have climbed Billboard and Mediabase charts, appeared on Sirius XM's ""Hit's 1"" station, played on radio stations across the country and played many live shows in the Los Angeles area at legendary venues such as Hotel Cafe and the Viper Room. The guys have accomplished all of this through consistent hard-work and determination, and the unconditional support of their fans.
""Freaky"" is a song that throws all caution to the wind. WOLVES plan on making a memorable statement with this song which celebrates individuality, courage and fun! The band hopes to raise spirits by allowing the listener to embrace the qualities that make us unique, and let that freak flag fly.
With your support, WOLVES will be able to create an original audio-visual work in the way that they've always imagined it. They will be able to collaborate with some of the most talented film-makers in Los Angeles and let the message of ""Freaky"" be heard through carefully planned promotion. The guys know that this song has the potential to change lives and that is why they are so enthusiastic about this project.

What We Need
Here are the fine details of what we need:

Most of this money will go directly toward making this video. We will need:
A director
A team of filmogrpahers
A few locations
A video editor
Costumes
A cast of actors
Set design
Secret sauce


A good amount of this will go towards a PR campaign with one of the best publicists in Los Angeles. This will get us exclusive access to:
Spotify playlists
Blog/Magazine reviews
Airtime on radio stations
Music video placement


We've also allocated a budget to go towards additional marketing and producing merchandise for our backers.

If for whatever reason we don't meet our goal, we will use the funds collected to make the music video anyway. This song is just TOO GOOD.

The Impact
The men of WOLVES have shared a dream since they started working together to make music that inspires people with a positive message. The band understands the raw power of music and the impact that it can have on peoples lives. Your contribution could help WOLVES reach their goal of reaching a much bigger audience and touching the lives of many people who may need to hear this song.

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge for us right now is funding our passion. We dream really big, almost to a fault, but we wouldn't have it any other way. We understand that to create the best art possible, it takes involvement of experts in every field. The video for ""Freaky"" will involve some seriously talented artists...and they need to make a living too. By supporting us, you are supporting them to get to the next level as well.
The music industry is one of the toughest places to succeed, and we find many artists who are in it for all the wrong reasons. From the bottom of our hearts, all we want to do is make people understand one another and bring the world together through music.

<p>Hey guys!! Hannah here to tell you about what we are up to at New Hope Fellowship and how it came about.</p>
<p>We are excited to announce that we are making an album!!</p>
<p><strong>The Story</strong></p>
<p>For the past ten years, Jeff has been traveling around America leading worship in different churches with a passion to spark a prayer and worship revival in our region. Jeff recently became the worship pastor of New Hope Fellowship in Bloomfiield NY and since then has teamed up with many talented singers and musicians at New Hope, including Danielle and I.</p>
<p>The three of us led worship together for the first time at a prayer night about a year ago. We realized after that set that something really special happened when we sang together. Since then we have had the opportunity to worship together at our church and in other settings (house worship nights, prayer nights, etc). It has been through these times of worship and spontaneous singing that prophetic choruses and songs have come about. One of the songs we wrote that came out of a few different spontaneous times is called “Praise Arise.” This song has been done at several different churches and a few conferences and we have always seen it make a huge impact.  (check out ""Praise Arise"" at the BASIC Conference in Rochester, NY <a href=""https://youtu.be/JL8CMgLvnIM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>). Because of the response that we have seen, and how powerful our times of worship have been we believe that God’s favor is on us now to join together in unity and believe for a move of God.</p>
<p>We really feel like  these songs are prophetic and ordained by God to impact our region and we want to share them with you. We want to start a movement of hope in an area where many feel like their hope has been lost, of joy where many have felt depressed, and of peace where many have felt anxiety and unrest. We know that God’s desire is to move and we want to be a part of it.</p>
<p>We need your help!</p>
<p>A lot of hard work goes into creating an album. Things like recording, mixing, mastering, videography, duplication, artwork, practice, songwriting and arranging all take time and money. </p>
<p>Its up to you to help us get there! Would you consider joining with us as we reach to see God move by partnering with us to make this album happen??</p>

We’re in the studio right now working on our first new album in almost 10 years! Sometimes in your early 20s the world seems so vast and limitless that you need to break off from your friends and explore the world. The amazing thing about this limitless life is that sometimes you’re able to reconnect with the things that make you who you are…we’ve been watching a lot of our favorite bands from our touring days reunite and make new albums and go out and make new friends and new memories and we want in on the action. We started exchanging emails across the country about what a new album for The London would sound and look like, we started bouncing creative ideas off of one another and to our surprise we all had a similar picture in mind and still really enjoy working with one another…our skills are complimentary. We are a band in the truest sense of the word. Brothers. A gang. We are making the best music and art of our lives and we can’t finish it without your help! Our last record, “Young and In Love” took us from a basement in Pittsburgh, Pa to a management/record deal in LA and helped us make friends all over North America and really all over the world while giving us a lifetime of memories and friends. We know this new album has the potential to connect with people everywhere and continue that adventure. </p><p>We need to raise $10,000 by september 6 to finish the album. We have already paid for about half of it ourselves but with taking time off of work to all be in the same city and just how expensive making an album is we’re getting pretty close to being tapped out and being DOA. We’ve enlisted some really talented friends like: Paul Menotiades, Kenny Blake, George Jones, Lexa Terrestrial as well as music video directors Jordan Beckham and Jamie Wright. We need the money to: 1. Pay for a little bit more studio time. 2. Pay musicians. 3. Have the record mixed 4. Have the record mastered by Garrett Haines at Treelady Mastering 5. Get actual physical vinyl and CD’s pressed. 6. Finish the music video for our first single “Girls” with director Jordan Beckham. 7. Finish the music video for the song “You Keep Leaving Me Here” that we started shooting with Jamie Wright of Division St. Films. 8. Get out on tour and start playing these songs for you like a real rock n’ roll band. </p><p>If you’re reading this, you know us individually or collectively and know that we live and breathe music. This is the culmination of our life’s work. &lt;3 We’re still the same guys who self-booked their first 2 month US tour, the kids who took it from a basement in Pittsburgh to Webster Hall in NYC or The Viper Room on The Sunset Strip or Live on National TV on WGN Midday News in Chicago. We’re still the band some of you would drive hours to see and sing at the top of your lungs for…if anything we’re just more comfortable being ourselves and better at it. We can’t wait to see you guys at a show!</p><p>In the past we’ve went with the traditional management/label route that I think most bands had to do in the past before social media was what it is now and before we were all so connected. We’re hoping to bypass a lot of that stress and bad advice and deals by just dealing with our supporters directly. No middleman, just a band and their fans sustaining and growing together. If we don’t meet our goal I honestly don’t know what we’re going to do…this art is so good that we’ve been begging, borrowing and pawning guitars and studio gear to just keep the music flowing!

<p>Résumer plus de 40 ans de carrière c’est un exercice en soi, voici mon « court » parcours de carrière et celui du Yves Lambert TRIO.</p>
<p>Fécondée au célèbre Hôtel Champlain du lac des Français par de joyeux créatifs et d’une gestation estival très festive, c’est finalement Mario Forest,  André Marchand et moi-même qui  a mis  au monde à l’automne 1976 le groupe<i> La Bottine souriante</i> sans se douter qu’elle deviendrait légendaire.</p>
<p>La Bottine souriante a été pendant 26 ans mon école et mon repère où j’ai exploré sur plusieurs coutures et plusieurs angles la musique traditionnelle.</p>
<p>J’ai fait ma valise en janvier 2003 pour partir en quête  de nouvelles aventures.</p>
<p>Depuis 2010, avec mes talentueux complices depuis 2004, Olivier Rondeau et Tommy Gauthier, nous présentons notre spectacle en formule TRIO. Le disque éponyme gagnera un Félix en 2013 pour l’album traditionnel de l’année et le deuxième Laissez courir les chiens a gagné en 2017 le Félix pour l’album traditionnel de l’année.</p>
<p><strong>Olivier Rondeau</strong> est un guitariste, arrangeur et réalisateur de grand talent. Il a obtenu un «Major in Music» spécialisé en guitare jazz de l’Université Concordia. Son talent exceptionnel d’instrumentiste inspiré et versatile l’ont amené a créé un jeu unique pour accompagner le trio. Par  une simple modification de sa guitare Olivier Rondeau a ajouté de la profondeur  à son jeu de guitare en élargissant la gamme dynamique de son instrument. Ce processus lui permet de jouer de la guitare et la basse en même temps. Sa conception de la musique et ses arrangements ont trouvé une identité originale et différente. La grande implication et la créativité aux arrangements d’Olivier, a été le cœur du Bébert Orchestra et maintenant du Trio. Ses talents d’arrangeurs et de réalisateur se fait remarquer dans l’album <i>Héritage Humain </i>de Marie Marine fille de Raymond Lévesque et du magnifique album de <i>Lawrence Lepage- le temps</i>. De plus il a accompagné en tournée européenne le groupe <i>The McDades</i> et en spectacle au Québec Charles Papasoff et Nicolas Pellerin.</p>
<p>Dans un style folk, country, populaire ou jazz, <strong>Tommy Gauthier</strong> navigue aisément dans tous ces styles, alliant polyvalence, agilité et musicalité. J’apprécie beaucoup les capacités multi instrumentiste de Tommy qui sont d’une fluidité étonnante et remarquable au violon, bouzouki, mandoline, pieds, percussion. Improvisateur, Tommy sait comment jouer en interaction avec la mélodie principale. Sa rigueur, sa passion, son esprit créatif et sa rythmique naturelle contribuent à l’originalité des arrangements essentiels dans le Trio. Malgré sa jeunesse, Tommy a une impressionnante feuille de route  qui l'a amené à réaliser plusieurs albums avec maints artistes et à participer également à des tournées américaines et européennes, entre autres avec Le Bébert Orchestra, Roch Voisine, Antoine Dufour, Richard Desjardins Robert Charlebois. Il est bachelier de l’Université de Montréal en improvisation Jazz où il enseigne depuis 2006.</p>
<p>Le défi et le risque artistique que le Trio relève à chaque nouveau projet se situe dans la pertinence de  la relecture de cette musique traditionnelle, tout en poursuivant notre objectif de créer une horizontalité entre le festif et l’engagement social, entre le passé et le présent. Comment transmettre la conscience de notre patrimoine dans un contexte contemporain et rester congruent authentique et créatif ? C’est un défi constant que nous désirons relever encore une fois</p>
<p>Un nouvel album c’est un moment de faire le point pour mieux nous aventurer et risquer la création d’un nouveau répertoire avec de nouveaux arrangements J’aime décortiquer, compresser, modifier un répertoire existant dans l’intention d’en bonifier la force d’authenticité tout en lui offrant une réponse musicale contemporaine, intelligente afin de mettre en lumière la richesse de notre patrimoine culturel.

</div></div>","Résumer plus de 40 ans de carrière c’est un exercice en soi, voici mon « court » parcours de carrière et celui du Yves Lambert TRIO.
Fécondée au célèbre Hôtel Champlain du lac des Français par de joyeux créatifs et d’une gestation estival très festive, c’est finalement Mario Forest,  André Marchand et moi-même qui  a mis  au monde à l’automne 1976 le groupe La Bottine souriante sans se douter qu’elle deviendrait légendaire.
La Bottine souriante a été pendant 26 ans mon école et mon repère où j’ai exploré sur plusieurs coutures et plusieurs angles la musique traditionnelle.
J’ai fait ma valise en janvier 2003 pour partir en quête  de nouvelles aventures.
Depuis 2010, avec mes talentueux complices depuis 2004, Olivier Rondeau et Tommy Gauthier, nous présentons notre spectacle en formule TRIO. Le disque éponyme gagnera un Félix en 2013 pour l’album traditionnel de l’année et le deuxième Laissez courir les chiens a gagné en 2017 le Félix pour l’album traditionnel de l’année.
Olivier Rondeau est un guitariste, arrangeur et réalisateur de grand talent. Il a obtenu un «Major in Music» spécialisé en guitare jazz de l’Université Concordia. Son talent exceptionnel d’instrumentiste inspiré et versatile l’ont amené a créé un jeu unique pour accompagner le trio. Par  une simple modification de sa guitare Olivier Rondeau a ajouté de la profondeur  à son jeu de guitare en élargissant la gamme dynamique de son instrument. Ce processus lui permet de jouer de la guitare et la basse en même temps. Sa conception de la musique et ses arrangements ont trouvé une identité originale et différente. La grande implication et la créativité aux arrangements d’Olivier, a été le cœur du Bébert Orchestra et maintenant du Trio. Ses talents d’arrangeurs et de réalisateur se fait remarquer dans l’album Héritage Humain de Marie Marine fille de Raymond Lévesque et du magnifique album de Lawrence Lepage- le temps. De plus il a accompagné en tournée européenne le groupe The McDades et en spectacle au Québec Charles Papasoff et Nicolas Pellerin.
Dans un style folk, country, populaire ou jazz, Tommy Gauthier navigue aisément dans tous ces styles, alliant polyvalence, agilité et musicalité. J’apprécie beaucoup les capacités multi instrumentiste de Tommy qui sont d’une fluidité étonnante et remarquable au violon, bouzouki, mandoline, pieds, percussion. Improvisateur, Tommy sait comment jouer en interaction avec la mélodie principale. Sa rigueur, sa passion, son esprit créatif et sa rythmique naturelle contribuent à l’originalité des arrangements essentiels dans le Trio. Malgré sa jeunesse, Tommy a une impressionnante feuille de route  qui l'a amené à réaliser plusieurs albums avec maints artistes et à participer également à des tournées américaines et européennes, entre autres avec Le Bébert Orchestra, Roch Voisine, Antoine Dufour, Richard Desjardins Robert Charlebois. Il est bachelier de l’Université de Montréal en improvisation Jazz où il enseigne depuis 2006.
Le défi et le risque artistique que le Trio relève à chaque nouveau projet se situe dans la pertinence de  la relecture de cette musique traditionnelle, tout en poursuivant notre objectif de créer une horizontalité entre le festif et l’engagement social, entre le passé et le présent. Comment transmettre la conscience de notre patrimoine dans un contexte contemporain et rester congruent authentique et créatif ? C’est un défi constant que nous désirons relever encore une fois
Un nouvel album c’est un moment de faire le point pour mieux nous aventurer et risquer la création d’un nouveau répertoire avec de nouveaux arrangements J’aime décortiquer, compresser, modifier un répertoire existant dans l’intention d’en bonifier la force d’authenticité tout en lui offrant une réponse musicale contemporaine, intelligente afin de mettre en lumière la richesse de notre patrimoine culturel. Le tout bien ficelé par notre complicité musical et le talent et la direction musicale d’Olivier Rondeau et Tommy Gauthier.
Pour « jongler » cette matière vivante qu’est notre musique traditionnelle, nous avons besoin de votre soutien.  Encouragez-nous en participant au financement du nouvel album qu’YVES LAMBERT TRIO est en train de vous mijoter!

<h3> </h3>
<p>My name is Steffen Prentiss Yazvac, and I am a musician and producer from Minneapolis, MN. Ever since I've been writing music in my teenage years, it has been an avenue for vulnerability and processing my thoughts(initially without knowing it). When I discovered digital recording, I gained access to a whole new palette that opened up all sorts of creative options. I am always striving to improve at the challenge of taking the ideas in my head and carrying them through to a finished piece of art. </p>
<p>This particular collection of songs deals with deeply emotional subjects and delves deep into fundamental questions that many of us ask. You’ll hear themes about overcoming anxiety, the search for meaning, fighting off nihilism, wrestling with Christianity, challenging rigid views of sexuality, reconciling the past, and looking forward with hope. One of my main endeavors right now is to contribute to the world by letting my voice be heard. This album is a giant step forward in that area. I know that not everyone will like everything I have to say, but I've decided that it is still worth saying.

<p>One big difference that will set this record apart from my previous releases is having other people play on it and spending some extra bucks for pro mastering. I know so many amazing musicians, and I'm very excited to be collaborating with some of them on this recording.  I’ve realized there’s no good reason to limit the arrangement to instruments that I can play, and I believe it will improve my music exponentially. With your help, I’ll be able to make something beautiful that showcases top notch musicians and surpasses the level of production on my previous records. </p>
<p>The funds you contribute to this record will go to pay the talented musicians that will play on it, mastering, a space to record in, and album art. </p>
<p>Here is the cost breakdown:</p>
<p>Musicians: $1300</p>
<p>Mastering: $540</p>
<p>Distribution:$90</p>

</div></div>","My name is Steffen Prentiss Yazvac, and I am a musician and producer from Minneapolis, MN. Ever since I've been writing music in my teenage years, it has been an avenue for vulnerability and processing my thoughts(initially without knowing it). When I discovered digital recording, I gained access to a whole new palette that opened up all sorts of creative options. I am always striving to improve at the challenge of taking the ideas in my head and carrying them through to a finished piece of art. 
This particular collection of songs deals with deeply emotional subjects and delves deep into fundamental questions that many of us ask. You’ll hear themes about overcoming anxiety, the search for meaning, fighting off nihilism, wrestling with Christianity, challenging rigid views of sexuality, reconciling the past, and looking forward with hope. One of my main endeavors right now is to contribute to the world by letting my voice be heard. This album is a giant step forward in that area. I know that not everyone will like everything I have to say, but I've decided that it is still worth saying. Although these songs express feelings of darkness and hopelessness at times, my end goal in writing them was to inspire and challenge people to move forward despite difficulty, pain, and suffering.

<h3>Jamey &amp; Martin</h3>
<p>You know Martin (Stubbily Mug) as the enigma. You know Jamey (Royal Ruckus) as the always-positive storyteller and community leader. Together they form the worst white rap duo in the history of the United States of America. And they are spreading.</p>
<p>Your contributiuons go to god-knows-what, gas money, playing more shows, and the filming of a Bandturo documentary--if we raise the goal amount.</p>
<p>Please consider contributing to help fund us bringing Amber on tour with us to make extra stops and feature Martin's friends all over the country in the first ever Bandturo independent artist industry documentary. This is our core goal for this crowdfunding campaign. It is why we are donating our services and merch to the cause: to bring Amber to make the documentary happen.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What we need:</p>
<ol>
<li>Funds for rewards to pay Amber to take of her shitty job and still afford her rent, rising health costs, and other bills she pays every month. Please ask us for an itemized rundown of the costs we need to cover for her if it means you deciding to make a contribution.</li>
<li>People, friends, fans, and the curious to spread the word. We are not only promoting our music, we are promoting other indie artists and workers through the documentary, as well as Martin and Amber's app/Alexa skill ""Chapter One"" which reads a new chapter of a book every day we can to get kids and adults more into reading. With ""Chapter One"" on Apple, Google, Alexa, and other platforms, anyone can listen to a new first chapter (or two) any time from anywhere for free and decide if they want to pick up the book and read the rest of it. All the books so far are in the public domain and thus free on Google, Gutenberg, and other literary databases and platforms.</li>
</ol>
<p>What you get:</p>
<p>We've tried really hard to come up with meaningful and authentic rewards for you that are unique and special to you.</p>
<ol>
<li>Unique and limited quantity rewards you can keep on your hope chest, profile, or eBay account for resale when we get famous.</li>
<li>Access to our exclusive email list where you will the first--and often the only--to get contacted about other rare stuff Martin will be doing over the course of his life.</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Giving Amber a chance to see more of the world from the confines of an ever more stressful corporate job at a company that's increasingly getting the bad press it deserves is a great human thing to do. If you can help one, you are helping others. If you know Amber, you know she is one of the few people that's ever touched your life with nothing but pure love and positivity. And while our company isn't quite yet at the point to get her the pay and benefits she deserves, we are always finding ways to get her trained, paid, and evolved.</p>
<p>The impact of our ""Chapter One"" flash briefing can be great. Right now we're just focusing on keeping it running with all the other things on our plate, and we have great faith that over time we will gain an even bigger following to create a huge impact on literary health and imagination in a now super digital, fleeting world.</p>
<p>Keeping funds in the tour and documentary budget allows the artists to focus on their craft and producing a DIY film that exhibits the tough-as-hell, often confusing and misleading independent music industry. This is a core mission of Bandturo and our other companies' duties.</p>
<p>With this campaign, you have the chance to inject directly into the nucleus of everything Martin, Jamey, and Amber are doing.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If we don't raise enough fast enough (we need most of the target goal amount in the first 5 days so Amber can decide to give up her shifts) we will still be able to go on tour, fulfill our contributor's rewards, and get some footage for our documentary. If we don't, the thesis of the documentary will likely change, the hook will probably get softer, and Amber will spend her time continuing to keep herself occupied with helping book tours, 3-D printing cool stuff, and looking for the next step in her career. If we do, we get to focus on bringing you the coolest stuff possible, a great down-to-Earth documentary about our industry, and probably a daily live stream of our adventures featuring Martin the unpredictable idiot-savant-idiot, Jamey the actual good, wholesome person with a lot of secrets, and Amber the poor thing that we drag along with us in a Toyota Rav 4.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
<p>If you've read this much, we are already in your debt for your time and attention. And we truly mean that. As someone that spends 80% of his time talking with customers that aren't actually paying customers, I understand how far a few minutes of someone's time can go. If I didn't need eye surgery myself and to pay off some debt to get a home I would easily trade a check for the thank you emails I get from helping hundreds of people every year. Nothing feels better than that, and if you've just laid eyes on another one of my projects like this campaign then I have nothing adequate to say about you sticking with me and staying curious as a person. Staying curious is paramount this year. -Martin</p>

</div><div>
<p>It's a no-brainer:</p>
<p>When you support an artist you are helping to bring art into the world! With art comes emotion, healing, and understanding. However it is that you support the arts, you make it possible for artists to keep creating. When you do so, you are guaranteeing that this world will continue to have original art and music.</p>
<p>This particular project gives Venezuelan people proof that there are still ways for Venezuelan artists to create and grow despite the terrible conditions their country is going through. Besides, most of our lyrics spread the word about what's going on in our country.</p>
<p>Anything you contribute to it is also helping us to take the next step in our musical careers and opening more doors and possibilities for the future!</p>
<p><strong>Remember:</strong> 10% of the proceeds will be donated to 'Opción Venezuela', an organization dedicated to providing tools and training to Venezuelans, helping them towards entrepreneurship and solution building.</p>

De Donde Vengo [Videolyric in Spanish] - La Pagana Trinidad

The Impact

It's a no-brainer:
When you support an artist you are helping to bring art into the world! With art comes emotion, healing, and understanding. However it is that you support the arts, you make it possible for artists to keep creating. When you do so, you are guaranteeing that this world will continue to have original art and music.
This particular project gives Venezuelan people proof that there are still ways for Venezuelan artists to create and grow despite the terrible conditions their country is going through. Besides, most of our lyrics spread the word about what's going on in our country.
Anything you contribute to it is also helping us to take the next step in our musical careers and opening more doors and possibilities for the future!
Remember: 10% of the proceeds will be donated to 'Opción Venezuela', an organization dedicated to providing tools and training to Venezuelans, helping them towards entrepreneurship and solution building.

Spreading the word over social media can connect us with brand new people who may love our music and who might want to check out our upcoming album.
From La Pagana Trinidad to you- THANK YOU!
Let's make an amazing record!
With love <3
Ale, Armando, and Fer.

<h3>A Tale to Tell:</h3>
<p>After many years of composing and gathering some of the best musicians from around the globe, The Fractured Dimension now returns with our most epic work yet. On the Precipice of Many Infinities carries the listener through life and death, through trials and tribulations, all inspired by the turbulent recent life events of primary composer, Jimmy Pitts. These themes, while inspired by personal struggles and triumphs, are completely universal in scope. Who hasn't had their ups and downs as they live life on the Pale Blue Dot? This album is for everyone. This is for you all, the heroes of your own singular journeys. </p>
</div><div><p>Throughout the process of creating this album, many costs have been incurred, and will continue to add up. We have funded everything ourselves up until this point. Yet, to get us over the final hurdle of replication, promotion, and mastering, we approach you, the listeners, to join us in bringing this painstaking creation to life. </p></div><div>
<p>Throughout the process of making this album, there has been the risk of it falling between the cracks of an immensely competitive market, or simply not finding its way to the right listeners. We have poured our hearts, souls, and untold amounts of  time and money into bringing the world something we are personally very proud of, something that will hopefully strike listeners as fresh and inspiring. </p>
<p>The musicians involved in On the Precipice of Many Infinities are:</p>
<p>Jimmy Pitts (Eternity's End, Equipoise), Jerry Twyford (Pitts Minnemann Project, ex-Scholomance), Hannes Grossmann (Alkaloid, Blotted Science), Vishal J Singh (Amogh Symphony), Danny Tunker (Alkaloid), Marcel Coenen (Ayreon), Carl August Tidemann (Winds, ex-Arcturus), Tom Fountainhead Geldschlager (Defeated Sanity, ex-Obscura), Ron Jarzombek (Watchtower, Spastic Ink), Phil Tougas (First Fragment), Phyllis Rutter (Eynomia), Jason Sadites, Tom Kopyto, Mark Hawkins, Jeremy Barnes, Bill Bruce, Joe Deninzon (Stratospheerious), &amp; Pete Generous.</p>

My name is ya and I am a female solo artist, originally from Moscow, Russia but now living in Spain. I have been making art and engaging in story telling for as long as I can remember, through any form; music, theatre, writing and film. My public music career was born in the midst of the pandemic in 2020 when I began releasing alternative pop singles while working in isolation, one of which was ""Movie"". The song became the most successful and was what got me signed to a record label Estabrook Road Records in the US with whom I released my debut album ""Change Your Body"" in January 2021. I included ""Movie"" in this album, knowing it's my listeners' favourite song and because the song is very important to me as an artist struggling with identity issues, as almost all of us do. ""Movie"" is a song of me desperately trying to find certainty in my identity, something which I know now is impossible for we are all ever-changing (yes, this is related to my album title). </p><h2>
<br/>""Movie"" - a pop anthem for the identity-less? </h2><p><br/>I know there are people like me who feel like they need to be their very best self at all times and it's soul wrenching. I want to represent those people and remind them that whatever you are being, is you and you shouldn't ever limit yourself to any one identity. Moreover, ""Movie"" contributes to the future of pop music; romanticised but raw, groovy but mellow, it contains the stripped down and openly self-conceited demand for attention in the world of postmodern individualism. </p><h3>
<br/>Music video </h3><p><br/>I've got to let you know that I have had filmmakers in my family so it runs in my blood. My taste being particularly concerned with Surrealism seen in David Lynch and Federico Fellini. It might be strange to associate this menacing style with a modern pop song like ""Movie"" but after long, long thought I have come to a visual representation of the song that is peculiar, authentic and perfect to gift to my listeners who love the song more than any other. The plot of the music video is highly tied to the theme of dreams versus reality; I treat my dreams with the same importance as I treat everyday life and I will explore these ideas in the video, creating a unique setting independent of any living or dreaming spectrum.</p><h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p><br/>For the filming of this music video which with all honestly will be my best video, at least so far, I need to ensure professional production. It's much harder to film a music video during a global pandemic but that won't stop me, I just need some help.

I have set this campaign on Flexible Goal because even if I don't reach this particular goal I will do the best I can with the help that I do get. Whatever your contribution, I will not forget it or take it for granted.<br/>For this reason, beyond the final product of the music video I have set up perks, depending on the contribution which include being credited in the video, free and new merchandise, ya community membership which includes exclusive content like songs no one else has heard and receiving the music video before anyone else.</p><p> <br/>If you aren't familiar with the song, you can listen here - <a href=""https://songwhip.com/ya-music/movie2021"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://songwhip.com/ya-music/movie2021</a></p><p><br/>Thank you so much for taking your time and considering helping me grow!</p><p> </p></div>","Who is ya?Hey!

<p>In March of 2020, just before the lockdown, I had completed work on my latest album, entitled “The Way Is Clear.”</p>
<p>I had been mostly on hiatus from gigging for several months while I put the finishing touches on the music and oversaw the development of the cover art. Little did I know what was looming...</p>
<p>Rock n Roll in the time of Covid</p>
<p>I knew from pressing previous albums that the process typically takes at least four months to complete from the time that the finished audio and art is delivered to the plant. At the time, in quarantine and with everything up in the air and all supply lines grinding to a halt, it occurred to me that it might take even longer and there might not be any shows at which I would sell said vinyl.</p>
<p>The decision was then made to release the album on all digital platforms on June 5th and follow that up with extensive radio and press campaigns to get the word out instead of touring. The idea being that people would all be captive in their homes and could really use the healing light of music in their lives, which I was all too happy to provide. </p>
<p>This approach was very successful, with the album eventually reaching number 15 on the Jamband charts, getting over 100 radio adds in the US and reaching as high as #220 on the Americana charts. All this, plus a number of glowing reviews in several prominent music media outlets... Big news for a somewhat under the radar artist such as myself who makes music, first and foremost, to satisfy the muse.</p>
<p>The expense of that promotional push took up what funds might have been ordinarily allocated for the vinyl pressing, which is a labor of love and far more costly to produce than compact discs. So, in the aftermath, I began saving my pennies and was able to order the vinyl at the end of October.</p>
<p>My premonition about it taking longer was correct. Here we are, almost 6 months from that time and it’s finally in the finishing stages.</p>
<p>I’m expecting delivery any day and I can hardly wait!</p>
<p>Typically, one engages in crowdfunding to help pay for a project in the works. This time, the project is done and paid for, so funds from this presale will be funneled right in to studio time and production costs for my next recordings currently in the planning stages or already in the works! </p>
<p>It’s expensive business, this making of records. But, at the end of the day, if it brings some enjoyment and/or gives the listener some cerebral or emotional stimulation, then it’s 100% worth it. Added to that, I am an audiophile and I care deeply about the sonic quality of my own work. I feel that vinyl records are the very best medium for the active listener and the big album art offers a better visual and tactile experience than CDs or, even worse, digital streaming platforms. Vinyl represents active, engaged listening and a pride of ownership in these days when music has been devalued to the point where most people think it should be free, despite all of the expenses involved with creating it and the personal risks and financial instabilities that a working musician must face. </p>
<p>With that, I hope you will choose and enjoy one of these exciting perks. The creation and appreciation of art is one big collaborative circle of energy and the result is one of mutual elevation. </p>
<p>Wishing you all lots of love, good health and bright hopes for the future!</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong>UPDATE-Aug. 4th-The campaign has been extended to Aug. 19th. It has been tough going, but I believe I will meet my goal..........whatever happens, this record will be made.....we may have to make adjustments, but it will be made. So, take heart and believe and help me push this over the edge!</strong></p>
<p>It's time to make a new record. The last record, <strong>Some Comfort,</strong> was crowdfunded right here on Indiegogo. I consider it the best record I ever made......Fear Nothing grew up. <strong>I could not have made it without you.</strong></p>
<p>I now have a collection of songs that i've written or co-written with <strong>Beth Neilson Chapman, Graham Gouldman from 10cc</strong>, rising star <strong>Robert Vincent</strong>, and my recent UK tour co-hort, <strong>Kelli Jones</strong>. Most of the songs were written during the Buddy Holly Foundation's songwriting weeks and a couple were specifically geared towards the songs<strong> Buddy Holly</strong> and my Dad wrote together for the Everly Brothers.</p>
<p>I had not intended to make a new record this year, but this crazy lockdown changed things for me. All of my live shows have been moved to later in the winter and 2021, so, like everyone else.....the world stopped for awhile and I had some time to think.....maybe too much time!  All of my records start with a list of songs, so I went to the piano with my guitar and a notepad and started playing the songs i'd written. I got inspired. I got excited about the possibilities. </p>
<p>I called my friend<strong> Bob Britt,</strong> who plays guitar with <strong>Bob Dylan,</strong> and asked him if he would be interested. He said, ""let me check my book"" and immediately came back and said ""yes!"".........all of his shows with Dylan for June and July were canceled. I called <strong>Garry Tallent from Springsteen's E Street Band </strong>and got the thumbs up. I called my engineer/co-producer <strong>Mike Esser.</strong>.......we spoke for 2 hours about who would play on the record, the how and where we would record, and then he said, ""hey Kev, I've got to get going. I've got to be downtown by 2pm""......I said, ""cool, where are you going?""......he said, ""they have a food kitchen set up and I need to get down there and get something to eat""................right then and there I knew we had to make this record happen. I said, ""dude, we are doing this record and as soon as it gets funded you are getting an advance"".................that kid has worked his butt off to build Sundog Studios in East Nashville and this lockdown has nearly put him under. It's time to go to work.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1592517066/uqgnsfuxrpp8xk4pp5mt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>    <strong> Me with the amazing Sammy Barrett and Mike Esser during the recording of Some Comfort</strong></p>
<p>One of the most exciting conversations was with <strong>Ron Oates.</strong> He was my Dad's piano player and arranger on all of his productions......starting from Bobby Goldsboro's ""Honey"" and ""Watching Scotty Grow"". For those who may be reading this and not aware. My father was<strong> Bob</strong> <strong>Montgomery.</strong>.....his career started with Buddy Holly as a teen and he had a 60 year career in the music business.....producing such artists as <strong>Bobby Goldsboro, Waylon Jennings, Tammy Wynette, Janie Fricke, Razzy Bailey, Marty Robbins,</strong> <strong>Joe Diffie, Vern Gosdin </strong>and on and on. Ron Oates was my father's muse and right hand man and an integral part of my childhood.......because Dad was always in the studio and that was where I was any chance I got.  I sent Ron a song and asked him if he wanted to be involved, and then we came up with calling Dad's main studio players in to record with us. I've wanted to record with these guys for years, and for SO many reasons.......<strong>this will be special. </strong></p>
<p>So, that is the plan. I've got some songs I believe in, and my friends are some of the most talented musicians and singers in the world. We will record in Nashville in Mike Esser's Sundog Studios, and when we need a studio with a piano will go to Blackbird Studios. We will livestream much of the recording process so everyone can tune in daily. <strong>YOU will be able to tune in daily to see the progress and put in your two cents via the comments.</strong> </p>

<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>We need $15,750 to complete this project and deliver it to you. I'll have the cd pressed and mailed out at the very latest by Dec. 1st......in time for Christmas, but the goal will be to ship them as soon as the record is complete, so could be even sooner. </p>
<p>The monies will go to travel, food, studio time, musicians, pressing the cd.........I've been very conservative. </p>
<p>You will get to tune into the live recording process via Facebook Live and Youtube. During the making of ""Some Comfort"" we live streamed from the studio and it was awesome to be able to see comments and your thoughts. </p>
<p><strong>I'm excited about the ""perks""......my 1993 A&amp;M debut Fear Nothing </strong>is very hard to find and I'm now making it available for the first time behind a password protected area of my website where I'll put some never seen photos from the recording, and go into detail about the recording process.......a process that defined every record i've ever done going forward-largely because of my producer, <strong>Ed Cherney. </strong>What I learned from the making of Fear Nothing has informed every record i've made since. </p>
<p><strong>The signed copies of Another Long Story and True</strong>.......art begats art, and I figured what better way to make a new record than to sell those two records. I happen to have copies on hand and since I can't go out and play shows and sell them at the merch table........sell them as a perk! Even if you already have a copy......there is always someone's birthday, or Christmas coming up. Another Long Story was released in 1999 and features <strong>Doug Pettibone</strong> on guitars. True has guest slots by<strong> Ashley Monroe and Andrea Zonn. </strong></p>
<p><strong>100% the most exciting perk is Good Thing will now be in Vinyl!!!!!!!......</strong>this will be my first printing of any of the cds in vinyl. I got a record player this past Christmas and have found myself yearning to listen to records on vinyl lately........the whole process just makes it feel so much sweeter. I'm excited about this..........<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593172692/ddpdftupfw9x1vjlrme0.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The <strong>Virtual Concert perk</strong>.........I've enjoyed doing live webcasts from my dining room for the past 10 years or so, and one of the main things I love is seeing the comments scroll past. I find it interesting what people respond to..........which songs move them. These comments can literally bolster me when I need it most. This perk will be more one on one.......a two way street. I'll play the songs to be recorded and will welcome your input. You can even play me a song!</p>
<p>The<strong> Backstage Studio perk</strong>........my favorite place on Earth is inside a studio making a record. I guess it harkens back to seeking to be in the studio with my dad every chance I got when I was a kid. I spent years sitting on the couch in studios around Nashville watching him make records. I can smell the coffee.....hear the laughter from the jokes that are bandied about in the control room.....watch brilliant session guys take a song and turn it into magic. YOU will have the seat on the couch to hang with us while we try to create magic. You will be another member of the band when we take lunch or dinner break. Who knows? Maybe you even get handed a tamborine. We'll let you know if it works! I was invited to a Jackson Browne session once in Santa Monica. I played my producer Ed Cherney and a collection of folks the freshly made video for ""Red-blooded American Boy"" and after it ended Jackson invited me into the studio with the second engineer.......just the three of us. He played ""All Good Things"" from his in progress ""I'm Alive"" record. After it ended I said, ""I'd love to put a harmony vocal on that""......Jackson said, ""I think we have David Crosby coming in for that""...........I let it rest! Ha! It was less cowbell for me and more exit stage left................anyway, come join us. </p>

<p><strong>The Backyard Concert perks........</strong>as a veteran of four 50 States in 50 Days tours.....as you can imagine.....i've done more than a few house concerts. We live in strange times these days, but I refuse to believe that we are going to be prisoners to this pandemic indefinitely. So, I included this ""house concert"" option as an outdoors perk. By April of 2021,  I'm sure it will be ok to move it indoors if that is what you would like to do. You can invite as few or many friends to this event as you like. I have the sound system and will come to your home and play a full show. I actually prefer house concerts to regular venues. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1592578864/tuvce4qvoxqfqusi8pn7.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p><strong>Triple Pack of signed cds perk.......</strong>I've included a range of options for someone who wants to help by buying cds. This particular one contains the <strong>new cd</strong>, plus copies of <strong>True </strong>and <strong>Another Long Story.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Executive Producer perk...........</strong>wow, first of all, if you go for this perk.......you are my hero. You will have an open invitation to come be with us in the studio while we make this record..........top to bottom. You will be credited as an Executive Producer on the album credits. This could put the project over the top.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>           As i've been putting this together I've suddenly realized it has been 10 years since you guys helped me fund ""Some Comfort""............my son Beau was around 4 years old then. It was a full circle moment for me to have him with me in the studio for some of the recording. Watching him on the couch in the studio...........quietly observing, reminded me of myself as a child. This is one of my favorite photos of all time............<strong>Beau with Mike Esser at the mixing desk. </strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1592582803/pd7g8gbrgefrd8n5gjmm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>Beau is now 15 and nearly as tall as me. It's time to record a new record!</p>
<p><strong>Some Comfort </strong>was truly one of the best experiences i've had in the studio for several reasons. I broke through writer's block that had plagued me for years......even in th<strong>e Fear Nothing</strong> days. I literally wrote most of the songs on the day.....in the studio......and then called my friends to come play on the song fresh from writing it. I started writing ""The Greatest Love That Never Was"" at 9am......I had already scheduled the band to come in at 12 noon to record.......John Hobbs showed up at 10:30am. I was stuck on what to do in the bridge.......I asked John if he'd help me write it. We had it 15 minutes later. The band showed up and nailed it in the first take. Check it out:</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/uMvlHmlmY5k?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p><strong>Some Comfort</strong> saw my musician friends come together to breath beautiful life into my songs. My friends and supporters came together to make it happen financially, and we all came together in the live webcasting of the record. There were times when it was 2am..........and I could see a few people viewing the webcast and chiming in.........I asked their opinion.......we came together to make the record. </p>
<p>I know that Good Thing can be all that and more. I LOVE this photo of Ken Coomer, James Haggerty, and Mike McAdam. I asked them to look pensive while they studied to song's changes.......of course they became big goofballs. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1592585944/scqwnowgyzbyoz3ungrr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<div>I know these are strange times we are living in and it probably isn't the best time to be launching a crowdfunding campaign. I get it. I'm in the same boat. I appreciate you taking the time to read this far................if you can join us on the journey.............then please check out the perks and see if something suits you. </div>

</div></div>","Short Summary
UPDATE-Aug. 4th-The campaign has been extended to Aug. 19th. It has been tough going, but I believe I will meet my goal..........whatever happens, this record will be made.....we may have to make adjustments, but it will be made. So, take heart and believe and help me push this over the edge!
It's time to make a new record. The last record, Some Comfort, was crowdfunded right here on Indiegogo. I consider it the best record I ever made......Fear Nothing grew up. I could not have made it without you.
I now have a collection of songs that i've written or co-written with Beth Neilson Chapman, Graham Gouldman from 10cc, rising star Robert Vincent, and my recent UK tour co-hort, Kelli Jones. Most of the songs were written during the Buddy Holly Foundation's songwriting weeks and a couple were specifically geared towards the songs Buddy Holly and my Dad wrote together for the Everly Brothers.
I had not intended to make a new record this year, but this crazy lockdown changed things for me. All of my live shows have been moved to later in the winter and 2021, so, like everyone else.....the world stopped for awhile and I had some time to think.....maybe too much time!  All of my records start with a list of songs, so I went to the piano with my guitar and a notepad and started playing the songs i'd written. I got inspired. I got excited about the possibilities. 
I called my friend Bob Britt, who plays guitar with Bob Dylan, and asked him if he would be interested. He said, ""let me check my book"" and immediately came back and said ""yes!"".........all of his shows with Dylan for June and July were canceled. I called Garry Tallent from Springsteen's E Street Band and got the thumbs up. I called my engineer/co-producer Mike Esser........we spoke for 2 hours about who would play on the record, the how and where we would record, and then he said, ""hey Kev, I've got to get going. I've got to be downtown by 2pm""......I said, ""cool, where are you going?""......he said, ""they have a food kitchen set up and I need to get down there and get something to eat""................right then and there I knew we had to make this record happen. I said, ""dude, we are doing this record and as soon as it gets funded you are getting an advance"".................that kid has worked his butt off to build Sundog Studios in East Nashville and this lockdown has nearly put him under. It's time to go to work.
     Me with the amazing Sammy Barrett and Mike Esser during the recording of Some Comfort
One of the most exciting conversations was with Ron Oates. He was my Dad's piano player and arranger on all of his productions......starting from Bobby Goldsboro's ""Honey"" and ""Watching Scotty Grow"". For those who may be reading this and not aware. My father was Bob Montgomery......his career started with Buddy Holly as a teen and he had a 60 year career in the music business.....producing such artists as Bobby Goldsboro, Waylon Jennings, Tammy Wynette, Janie Fricke, Razzy Bailey, Marty Robbins, Joe Diffie, Vern Gosdin and on and on.

I've wanted to record with these guys for years, and for SO many reasons.......this will be special. 
So, that is the plan. I've got some songs I believe in, and my friends are some of the most talented musicians and singers in the world. We will record in Nashville in Mike Esser's Sundog Studios, and when we need a studio with a piano will go to Blackbird Studios. We will livestream much of the recording process so everyone can tune in daily. YOU will be able to tune in daily to see the progress and put in your two cents via the comments.

<p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For those of you who don’t know me, my name is Cody Apache Grosse and I am a musician based out Chicago IL. I've created this Indiegogo because I want to ask for your help, but before we get into that I want to tell you my story. That story starts about 5 years ago. I had just moved to Chicago for work. I was wide-eyed and eager to experience a life in business in the big city. I had a great job, I was making great money, I was going out all the time, but I wasn’t happy. I thought that if I just worked hard enough and climbed the corporate ladder, that one day I would be satisfied. So I did just that and I worked around the clock to earn the promotion that I wanted so badly. When that day finally came, guess what,  I got my promotion but it didn’t make me happy. So I decided to do something crazy.  I quit my job, sold my house and bought a one-way ticket overseas with nothing but a backpack and a guitar. I travelled from London as far as Japan. And by the end of my journey, I knew that music was the one thing that would make me happy and what I wanted to dedicate my life to.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Over the last 5 years I have been practicing my craft. I've released bodies of work containing music and visuals. I'm proud of that work but more importantly, I have been learning from that work. Every step I've taken up until this point has led me to what will come next, and this is where I need your help.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For the last 2 years, I have been working on a body of work that I believe will become my magnum opus, or in other words, the project I believe will come to define my artistry. I don't want to ruin the surprise so I won't go into too much, but I can tell you this project contain 3 main elements. I will be releasing a 5 song EP that will be accompanied by a 20-minute limited series as well as a 24-page conceptual editorial.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>As you have come to probably guess none of this is going to be cheap, and this is why I am asking for your help. In total, this project should require $50k to complete. Over the course of these last 6 months, I have been saving up as well as working with brands to raise funds for this project. But ultimately you are going to be the one to help me pull this project across the finish line. Every dollar you donate is going to the progression of my art. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I wanted to make sure to give you something in return for your support so I gave a lot of thought into some unlockable perks. Some of these range all the way from unreleased music, to a copy of the signed conceptual editorial, even a private performance for you and your friends.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I can’t thank you enough and I am truly honored to be creating my passion with you.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>Paper Crane is a collective of artists/musicians from St. Petersburg, FL. It is also the name of the DIY warehouse event space from which we have operated over the last few years. The space itself is beloved by the community, with a rich history of hard work and love put in over the years by many artists who preceded the current collective. Starting as a milk bottling plant, the space has had many transformations. In the last 10 years it has changed hands many times as it has become a hub for local artists, each adding something to elevate the space and its potential. With each change of hands, the space has taken on a different look, persona and often a different name. </p>
<p>The current collective has had the tremendous honor and luck of operating the space for the last 2+ years, with the goal of hosting events to enrich and empower the local art and music community in St. Petersburg. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What Happened?</h3>
<p>While our space has afforded us incredible opportunity, it is also fraught with problems and challenges, not the least of which being the general condition of the building. </p>
<p>In January 2020, we had a fire inspection which left us suddenly unable to operate out of the space that we, and so many others, have put our hearts and souls into. The resultant inspection report deemed the space unfit for assembly unless considerable repairs be made, which the owner was unwilling to do, and which are well beyond our means. It is simply not feasible to attempt to save the space itself; the general condition of the building is such that making such a large financial investment to bring it up to code would be tremendously foolish.</p>
<p>It is with a heavy heart that we realize the need to relinquish the space and move our operations elsewhere. And while it is sad to lose such a beloved place, this is also an opportunity to create something new. Something safer, longer lasting, more immersive, more empowering to the community, and less encumbered by the myriad challenges of a decaying building. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We're Asking</h3>
<p>We are seeking donations to further the mission of our art collective and event production crew, Paper Crane. Our primary goal is to find a new space where we can continue to produce fantastical and immersive experiences and bolster the creative community. This will be a considerable undertaking for our small art collective, and we are looking to you to help us get there. Your donations will go directly toward a new space for Paper Crane.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What's Our Plan?</h3>
<p>In the short term, out of necessity, we are making our operations mobile and bringing our unique brand of event production into other spaces in a ""pop-up"" format. </p>
<p>In the long term, Paper Crane is in need of a new home. This space has been our workshop, our meeting space, event venue, creative hub and space to collaborate with and provide resources to other local artists. It has been our home. We are committed to finding a new place where we can regularly host events that enrich and empower the community, and where we can continually transform the space to consistently provide new experiences to our guests.</p>

<h3>Dear friends and followers,</h3>
<p>A little less than a year ago I felt the urge to make a big step in my life: at the age of 47, I debuted as a composer with my first piano solo piece 'Tristesse'. I could not have imagined the support it would get from all of you, and I cannot explain what it means to me to hear you play my work and make it your own. </p>
<p>Now, a year later, I feel the courage to release my first full length debut album. It will be called ""Images"" and will be out on September 25th. I can hardly wait...<br/>I asked you in my newsletter and on my social media in which form you would like to have the album and many of you have responded, of which I'm very grateful. I've listened to you and want to make sure that all of this is available. To manufacture all these different things such as vinyl, cd's and books of sheet music, it would be so great if you would become part of this process and finalise the establishment of this album together.</p>
<p>If by any chance we would exceed our set goal, we would use it for the marketing and promotion for the album so that it can reach even more ears. </p>
<p>I like being an independent musician. Rather than playing the game that's called ""the music industry"" it feels so good to be directly connected to my fans and to go on my own pace and to listen to what you give back to me. </p>
<p>I promise you that this album is the best that I have to give you, and that I will continue my path as an artist and a composer. I hope, that one day when I'm able to travel and play live again, we'll meet each other so that I can thank you in person. </p>
<p>I will make sure that any item you order, will reach you at least a week before it will be released into the rest of the world. Already looking forward to hearing what you think of it.</p>
<p>I hope you stay in good health, </p>
<p>With love,</p>

<h3>Pre-Order our LP. People Are The Worst!</h3>
<p>Hello there reader, We're Cheap Meat, a distinguished Alternative Rock band from London, England. We released an EP back in 2016, got lots of lovely press, played some amazing shows, and then Back in 2018, we finished recording our debut LP.</p>
<p>2 years have passed, and a lot has happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>We stopped working with the one we were signed to!</li>
<li>We lost our booking agent!</li>
<li>We started our own label, The Jerk Store!</li>
<li>Matt had two kids!</li>
<li>Pete started producing and performing Makola!</li>
<li>Ross went to Edinburgh as a comedian!</li>
<li>Ross and Pete got diagnosed with mental health issues!</li>
</ul>
<p>So we've been busy living life and dealing with all that comes with it. We're immensely proud of this album, and we want to give it a good chance in the world. We've fronted the cash to get PR for it to help spread the word, but we need your help...</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Here's where you come in.</h3>
<p>We want to press this record physically; it's got some beautiful artwork designed by Chris Hilton and illustrated by Stephen Alan Yorke, it deserves a physical pressing. But to do that costs money and that's where you can help!</p>
<p>A 180gram vinyl run with good sleeves for the artwork costs around £1500. We've already spent around that on PR, and we've spent thousands more making it, which is why the target is at £2000 (but by all means lets go over that!)</p>
<p>We want to keep it to a nice limited run for the folks that supported us. (And frankly, 150 is probably pushing it!) </p>
<p>But we don't want to give you the vinyl, folks like merch; we sure do so we've gone and made some!</p>
<p>You can get t-shirts, tote bags, posters, and for the super cool gang, an hour with us on zoom.</p>
<p>Any money received goes back into recouping the costs of pressing the records, not to mention the thousands of pounds we spent, making it, the music videos, touring, and countless other ways bands can spend money.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Not many risks here, the only issue would be if the vinyl pressing takes longer than we anticipate, I've put March as a rough deadline. If we hit our target before the 29th of January, I'll get the order in sooner. The sooner it's in, the quicker we'll get them, but we're an indie label, so there are big rich major labels ahead of us. </p>
<p>If we don't hit our target, but you've pre-ordered the album, we're still going to press it, so you'll get a copy of the album no matter what. Just means we'll be on stale bread and soup for the start of 2021. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Alright, I'm in. I've given you some sweet cash, now what?</h3>

Have a listen below. </p><div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/vOySSotiZKQ?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>As you can probably guess, live organists at sporting events aren't exactly commonplace anymore. But, in the past two years, I've had the good fortune to bring the classic vibe to countless Philadelphia Jr. Flyers (EHL) games, the 2019 College Hockey Mid-America tournament, and the 2020 Atlantic Youth Hockey League and Collegiate Hockey Federation playoffs. Through this project, once complete, I can help bring that same ""game day experience"" to your club, school or college — or even beer league team — from the opening strains of the American and Canadian national anthems all the way to the final horn.</p>
</div><h3>Expected Costs</h3><p>While I will arrange, perform, engineer and produce the entirety of this record — and thus not have to pay for studio time or an engineer — there's still considerable cost involved in a product of this scope. Most of that cost can be attributed to two elements:</p><p><strong>• Mechanical licensing.</strong> For every song that does not exist in the public domain (""Lady of Spain,"" anyone?), I must pay the owners of that song 9.1¢ per unit produced for the right to record their song. And, let's face it: people want to hear popular music a heckuva lot more than original bebop and Latin jazz at sporting events.</p><p>So, if I print 500 copies of this record, that's $45.50 per song right there. Needless to say, it adds up.</p><p><strong>• Replication.</strong> Pressing CDs and USB drives costs money, too, from production of glass masters to printing sleeves and liners.</p><h3>What You (and your team!) Will Get</h3><p>Not only am I no stranger to the hockey rink, but I'm no stranger to the studio and the radio airwaves, either. I've recorded three albums of original music in the last decade, one with a 17-piece big band and two with my Pittsburgh-based organ trio.

Have a listen below. 

 
As you can probably guess, live organists at sporting events aren't exactly commonplace anymore. But, in the past two years, I've had the good fortune to bring the classic vibe to countless Philadelphia Jr. Flyers (EHL) games, the 2019 College Hockey Mid-America tournament, and the 2020 Atlantic Youth Hockey League and Collegiate Hockey Federation playoffs. Through this project, once complete, I can help bring that same ""game day experience"" to your club, school or college — or even beer league team — from the opening strains of the American and Canadian national anthems all the way to the final horn.
Expected CostsWhile I will arrange, perform, engineer and produce the entirety of this record — and thus not have to pay for studio time or an engineer — there's still considerable cost involved in a product of this scope. Most of that cost can be attributed to two elements:• Mechanical licensing. For every song that does not exist in the public domain (""Lady of Spain,"" anyone?), I must pay the owners of that song 9.1¢ per unit produced for the right to record their song. And, let's face it: people want to hear popular music a heckuva lot more than original bebop and Latin jazz at sporting events.So, if I print 500 copies of this record, that's $45.50 per song right there. Needless to say, it adds up.• Replication. Pressing CDs and USB drives costs money, too, from production of glass masters to printing sleeves and liners.What You (and your team!) Will GetNot only am I no stranger to the hockey rink, but I'm no stranger to the studio and the radio airwaves, either. I've recorded three albums of original music in the last decade, one with a 17-piece big band and two with my Pittsburgh-based organ trio. This record will be a massive departure from those before it, though, as it is geared specifically toward sports teams and arena DJs to bolster their game-day playlists.Once the project is complete, you will have a high-quality record (in CD or USB drive form) featuring stirring renditions of both the American and Canadian national anthems, a number of traditional ""crowd chants,"" and a wide variety of popular songs — from classic rock to R&B and beyond — reimagined in the hockey organ vein.

<h3>Estrella on the rise</h3>
<p>Hola Amigos!</p>
<p>What a time to be alive and to be following your dreams. If there is one thing I've learned, it is that there is no time like the present. Life is too short to not believe in yourself. </p>
<p>With that being said, I am here before you to share my song and story. About 4 years ago, I had that AHA moment where I realized that I no longer wanted to waste my time or talent on jobs that didn't support either. Slowly, I began to invest in myself. I started writing music, I found an artist to help produce my songs, I revisited voice lessons, and as of August 2020, I quit my job in Honolulu, Hawaii and moved back to Northern California to <u>pursue this dream full time</u>.  </p>
<p>I choose the stage name Estrella because it is my maiden name and it means star in spanish. My hispanic heritage combined with Native American roots and Scandinavian blood is a part of me that you are meeting now!</p>
<p>With an A+ team and community support, we have gotten ourselves this far and now need your help to get us to the next level. </p>

<h3>What Is Needed &amp; What You Get</h3>

<h3>Tell Me To Stay - The Album</h3>
<p>My name is Rob Murphy and I'm and east coast Singer/Songwriter from Cape Breton Island, Canada. In 2020 I was named by CBC Music as one of the Top 10 Artists to watch out for and one of the top finds of 2020 by Roots Music Canada. I was going to reinvest my live show income on this project but due to covid restrictions I've gone from 6 shows a month to 1 show.</p>
<p>I've already completed 5 out of the 12 Songs for this Album. The Album is being recorded at Broken Clock Studio and Mixed and Mastered by multiple East Coast Music Award Winner - Jamie Foulds.  There are 5 Songs that I co-wrote with Songwriters from Australia &amp; Nashville over the pandemic. All Songs are ready for production.</p>
<p>Songs from the Album will be a mix of Alt. Country, Folk with a Bruce Springsteen, Jason Isbell, Damien Rice feel. There will be 2 Videos produced as well to give traction on Social Media. My last Video Ghosts has over 25,000 views.</p>
<p>My dream is to finish and release this album as I've been a Musician for over 15 years. I've worked hard and was on my way to complete this when we were struck by the pandemic. I'll be selling Merch, CD's and Vinyl for online sales of the Album. I'm also hiring local Musicians on this project.</p>
<p>My goal is to raise $5000.00 to complete this project. Monies raised will be for the following:</p>
<p>Studio Time, Mixing and Mastering, Video, Hiring Musicians, CD &amp; Vinyl.</p>
<p>If I do not reach my goal I'll be cutting back to 10 Songs and 2 Videos. I'm a full time Musician and have proven that I take this very serious. From 2019 when I was named a Breakout Artist by the East Coast Music Association to the success I've had with a pandemic going on I believe you can rest assure that you'll be very pleased to be part of this project. My Production and Videos already released are top quality an you'll see that this is my passion.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>There's Perks!!</h3>
<p>You'll receive access to finished Songs before they're released. With your pledge of $25.00 or more you'll receive immediate access to the title track ""Tell Me To Stay"". A pledge of $50.00 or more you'll receive 5 tracks as they are Produced including Immediate access to ""Tell Me To Stay"". A pledge of over $100.00 you'll receive the 5 tracks plus a Full Length Vinyl Album 30 days before it's released for sale. Every dollar helps even a small amount is greatly appreciated to help make this dream come true. </p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Greetings curious strangers, beloved enemies, and cherished friends! We are Spectre Jones, an indie rock band based in Los Angeles, CA. Just before the recent and unanimously disliked public health crisis, we were busy working on some singles and tweaking our live set in preparation for a long strand of shows lined up in 2020.</p>
<p>And then it was as if society as we know it quickly changed from concrete to abstract, from real to surreal. To be fair, things were already getting a bit surreal before we came into contact with the virus, and that’s not to mention everything else that’s happened and come to light in the past year. But if we’re all being honest, not being able to hug your friends and family out fear of them getting sick and dying just really hits different. </p>
<p>So, as we sat stuck at home and wondered how we could help, some songs flew in through an open window and gave us hope that something joyously better than the old “normal” is coming on the other side of all this chaos. And we want to share those tidings of joy with you and with the world. But, we have to properly record it all first, so we could really use your help!</p>
<p>This campaign marks the start of Spectre Jones’ debut album-making process and will allow listeners a front-row seat to all the action as we fly by the seat of our pants and see what happens! Just kidding, we are (and have been) planning very meticulously (see below). Those who choose to support us will get to watch us make a full-length record together literally for the first time! And for us, anyone who chooses to support us in this process is playing a vital role in bringing these songs to life and spreading a little more love and hope in the world. And that’s where it’s at.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So here’s our game plan for recording and how you can help! We’ll be tracking at <a href=""https://www.boulevardrecording.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Boulevard Recording</a>, Clay Blair’s legendary room down in Hollywood in which we’ve been dying to record ever since we learned that Pink Floyd did some work on The Wall there. And we’ll have the privilege of working with engineer/producer extraordinaire <a href=""https://www.jameskrausse.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">James Krausse</a> again, with whom we’ve been dying to collaborate with since working on Nobody Else!</p>
<p>We're going to be facing some major costs: these include recording for an entire week at the studio, mixing and mastering the record, and a bunch of other costs like photoshoots for album cover art and getting our album out to all of you. Crowdfunding gives us the ability to record with some of the best and ensure we can share our best music yet with the world.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This is our first record together, which means the experience will be filled with a lot of “firsts.” While we’ve played so many hours of music together, we haven’t gotten to create a full body of work in this capacity before. A process like this isn’t without its challenges, but we’re excited to learn how to communicate and create in a new way together. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand the pandemic has had an overwhelming economic impact on many folks! If you are unable to contribute at this time we completely get it, and that’s okay! But if you still want to spread the word, go ahead and share this link with your friends and fam. We love and appreciate you all!</p>

<h3>Introduction/Background</h3>
<p>Hi, I am Dain Norman, singer/songwriter, musician, and producer out of Tacoma, WA. Over the past 5+ years or so I have been acting as my own manager,  and booking agent, traveling and performing all around the states, both solo and with my band The Chrysalis Effect, often sleeping in my car and roughing it. I have been putting out self-produced music recorded at home, and have written 400+ songs. I play the guitar, drums, bass guitar, cello, piano, harmonica, mandolin, upright bass, and ukulele. My introduction to music was at age 4 listening to 1950's rock n' roll vinyls with my grandfather, then at age 10, classical music, I started playing the cello through my school's orchestra program. Throughout my entire childhood, my family moved around the country, so I essentially grew up in many places. I consider myself most from FL. My father/step-dad passed away when I was 18, and he always believed in me and my music, which has had a lasting impact on me. I also have a 6-year-old son, so my time is split between working, family, and being a performing musician. Some of my early musical influences included Elvis Presley, The Beach Boys, The Stray Cats, The Beatles, Little Richard, The Ramones, Nirvana, and Led Zeppelin. </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Objective</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<div>
<p>This campaign is to raise funds to record with legendary producer Jonathan Plum, part owner of London Bridge Studios in Seattle, WA. He has produced bands and artists such as Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Blind Melon, Temple of Dog, Soundgarden, and Brandi Carlile. This opportunity for me would be life-changing, I have never had the opportunity to record in an actual studio. I have always had to work jobs in addition to being a traveling musician so this opportunity would potentially allow me to be a full-time musician and spend more time with my family, especially my young son. I am looking to record an EP, titled ""Shades Of Blue"", a collection of songs I wrote that are a reflection of the Covid-19 pandemic and what we collectively, and what I personally endured in 2020. Along with some good old, fun, feel-good tunes, which I feel we all need a little bit of right now. </p>
<p>With your help in this campaign, it would honestly mean the world and heavens to me and would be a dream come true in itself. I have literally fantasized for hours on end about how my songs would sound in a proper studio environment. I feel the type of songs I write would really flourish and bloom working with Jonathan.</p>
<p>I am looking to raise $2,500 for 2-3 days of recording time at London Bridge with Jonathan Plum. We plan on recording the songs with vintage 1970’s gear to tape. The basic tracks (drums/bass/guitar) will be performed and recorded live in studio like they used to in the old days, to capture the live energy, power, and emotion of a band at full force.</p>
<p>Perks for donations. If you would like to opt out of receiving the perks for your donation that is completely okay, no pressure! The perks include my past releases and future releases, with every higher amount you donate it builds on the previous perk. So depending on what you donate, you will receive all past perks, plus the new ones! </p>
</div>
</div><div>
<p>If we don’t reach the $2,500 goal, whatever funds that are there will be used towards recording time, and/or buying higher quality gear to record better quality sounds at home at the very least. Anything truly helps!</p>

Hi, I am Dain Norman, singer/songwriter, musician, and producer out of Tacoma, WA. Over the past 5+ years or so I have been acting as my own manager,  and booking agent, traveling and performing all around the states, both solo and with my band The Chrysalis Effect, often sleeping in my car and roughing it. I have been putting out self-produced music recorded at home, and have written 400+ songs. I play the guitar, drums, bass guitar, cello, piano, harmonica, mandolin, upright bass, and ukulele. My introduction to music was at age 4 listening to 1950's rock n' roll vinyls with my grandfather, then at age 10, classical music, I started playing the cello through my school's orchestra program. Throughout my entire childhood, my family moved around the country, so I essentially grew up in many places. I consider myself most from FL. My father/step-dad passed away when I was 18, and he always believed in me and my music, which has had a lasting impact on me. I also have a 6-year-old son, so my time is split between working, family, and being a performing musician. Some of my early musical influences included Elvis Presley, The Beach Boys, The Stray Cats, The Beatles, Little Richard, The Ramones, Nirvana, and Led Zeppelin. 
 
Objective
 

This campaign is to raise funds to record with legendary producer Jonathan Plum, part owner of London Bridge Studios in Seattle, WA. He has produced bands and artists such as Pearl Jam, Alice in Chains, Blind Melon, Temple of Dog, Soundgarden, and Brandi Carlile. This opportunity for me would be life-changing, I have never had the opportunity to record in an actual studio. I have always had to work jobs in addition to being a traveling musician so this opportunity would potentially allow me to be a full-time musician and spend more time with my family, especially my young son. I am looking to record an EP, titled ""Shades Of Blue"", a collection of songs I wrote that are a reflection of the Covid-19 pandemic and what we collectively, and what I personally endured in 2020. Along with some good old, fun, feel-good tunes, which I feel we all need a little bit of right now. 
With your help in this campaign, it would honestly mean the world and heavens to me and would be a dream come true in itself. I have literally fantasized for hours on end about how my songs would sound in a proper studio environment. I feel the type of songs I write would really flourish and bloom working with Jonathan.
I am looking to raise $2,500 for 2-3 days of recording time at London Bridge with Jonathan Plum. We plan on recording the songs with vintage 1970’s gear to tape. The basic tracks (drums/bass/guitar) will be performed and recorded live in studio like they used to in the old days, to capture the live energy, power, and emotion of a band at full force.
Perks for donations. If you would like to opt out of receiving the perks for your donation that is completely okay, no pressure! The perks include my past releases and future releases, with every higher amount you donate it builds on the previous perk. So depending on what you donate, you will receive all past perks, plus the new ones! 


If we don’t reach the $2,500 goal, whatever funds that are there will be used towards recording time, and/or buying higher quality gear to record better quality sounds at home at the very least. Anything truly helps!

What It Means 
This experience would allow me to reach a broader audience than I ever have before, and it will help me come closer to realizing a life-long dream, and hopefully introduce new people to my songs, and hopefully, those songs will help them cope with their everyday life, and fall in love again.

We're working to raise $5,000 for a tour van to share our music in new cities and festivals. Our dream is to share our music globally. Last year we played over 40 shows throughout Austin, San Marcos, San Antonio, Houston, and Denton, Texas, refining our craft and having a great time doing it. This year, we want to cross into new states and take things to the next level. We love performing for new audiences and know we can reach this goal with your help.</p>
<p>The $5,000 will go directly to purchasing the tour van and getting it ready for the road (i.e. making sure the tires, brakes, belts, etc. are all in good running condition). For your donation, we will gift you with all kinds of great music-related goodies! We just released our new album, ""Unfolding,"" and can give you digital download codes, physical CDs, stickers, posters, t-shirts, and more. In addition, we can get you tickets to our tour kick off show, special documentary footage from our tour, and original lyric books elucidating what our music's all about. We'll even play your private party for donating to help us get our tour van and share our music across the country. <br/></p>
<p>Once we have the $5,000 we'll be sure to diligently inspect potential vehicles, getting certified mechanics to evaluate the van before we purchase it. Our friends in fellow bands can help us book the tours. We have all of the musical equipment we need to travel and perform. Our energy and passion is focused. We just need your aid in funding our tour van. </p>
<p>Please, donate to our campaign as generously as you can and spread the word about it! If everyone contributes a little bit, we'll be there in no time. But hey! If you have any philanthropist friends who love great music, let them know about us! We put so much heart and soul into what we do and just need a little help making this dream come true. <br/></p>
<p>So please, donate now! Share this on Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, and we'll see you soon to play, fresh out of our new van!!<br/></p>

This was a great experience because it showed me how versatile I could be with strings.  In college I took piano and went back to the Cello, and took singing and ear training.   I also play the Guitar, Bass Guitar, Floor bass, and Violin.  I have a WaveDrum that I use for my beats and drum part and I LOVE it because it is loaded with all different cultural sounds.  I've been in bands and I currently do work as a Karaoke DeeJay.   </li> <li>This campaign is to find people interested in investing in a completed and professional debut album.  This is the springboard to all the other albums I have in my head.  I don't want to put out music because it's popular, I do it because it gives a voice to people who can't, it gives people an outlet, and hopefully inspires them.  I like to be unique and I love all different kinds of music. I like to combine cultures and genres.  I can't be confined to one genre, and I describe myself as myself, so doing my album on my own as an independent artist is the best way to maintain my sound.  This campaign is important to me because it not only allows me to release my first album, but it also provides me with critical equipment for future albums. </li> <li>I did a lot of thinking about going into a studio vs building my own studio, and I decided we all get the most bang for our buck if I finish my current studio with the input of a sound engineer.  Investing in this campaign means you are joining my journey at it's core, the ripple effect of this campaign will be felt for the rest of my life and hopefully we will remain together on this journey.  A portion of the proceeds from every album will go to a designated charity because it's about giving back.  Music can help people express themselves, can mend a heart, save a life, and build bridges, it is intertwined in my soul.  They say if you do what you love you never work a day in your life.  Well I can tell you writing and producing music is very hard work, but I would love if one day it were my main focus and I didn't need to work two jobs and then work on my music.  This could be the first step toward realizing that dream. </li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul> <li>I looked at other campaigns and then did some looking around for pricing. ultimately I decided that $15k - $20k would get the job done right.  I have included a Pie Chart for you, you can find it under photos.  Basically, the funds here go to purchasing equipment<span style=""background-color: initial;""> and production of the album.  Additional investments above our goal will go towards marketing and any other expenses that come up, like a music video.  If I am lucky enough to get investors above and beyond that I will take some time off from work to finish the album sooner!</span>
</li> <li>So the perks:  I didn't want you to ""Donate"" I wanted you to invest in me, so I tried to set up perks that were worth your investment.  These were not created light, to the right of your screen you will see these perks include custom sketches, album art, and even future albums if you choose to invest on that level.  </li>
<li>One perk not listed, to the top investor I will request your top 3 charities and choose one of those charities to donate a percentage of the proceeds from the sale of the album once it goes live.</li> <li>I am a go-getter, and very hard worker, if I don't find enough investments for this campaign I will do my best to carry on without them.  That means scaling back and I am sure I will have some challenges depending on the amount.  It might mean less songs on the album, or it might mean I have to get creative with my solutions in my studio, but one thing is certain.  I will complete this album and it will be the most professional album ever. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The potential impact is unlimited.  This campaign is a springboard, a starting point, the catalyst to putting out unique, heartfelt music written by someone who has lived through a great deal.  This campaign also sets us up for future albums one of which is dedicated to fighting depression and is named ""Songs for Danni.""  Another is ""Through the Shattered Mirror"" which is all about abuse, and a single album dedicated to the men and women in law enforcement are all on my radar to be completed within the next year.   Every Album I put out will donate a portion of the proceeds to a charity, the charity for this album will be selected from three choices of the top investor.  ""Songs for Danni"" will go to suicide prevention and to a scholarship that has been started by Danni's parents.  ""Through the Shattered Mirror"" will have proceeds going toward Domestic Violence.  So you see you are investing on a journey of a larger magnitude than just one album.  I won't forget those who were involved and I will keep you up dated and in the loop as long as you want to be!</p>
<ul>
<li>I believe in music with all my heart, and I believe it can help people heal, grieve, love and process any array of emotions, Strings of My Heart is all about processing emotions, sometimes moving on, feeling stuck, love, loss and so much more.  A friend once told me to be able to sing and song-write was rare, but it wasn't until recently that I began to see that first hand.  I also had the pleasurable experience of having people reach out and thank me for lyrics that touch them, or helped them and that is what it really all about!  By investing in this project, you aren't just investing in me,  you are investing in anyone who identifies with any of the songs on this album.  </li> <li>This is my first try at crowd funding. This method was suggested by a friend, when we were talking about how I spent every bit of savings I had when I took in the kids because they came to me with nothing. </li>
<li>I promise you, I will fight to keep this dream alive, I will work hard everyday and I will succeed.  I have succeeded at every other goal I have set for myself.  I bought my car, my motorcycle, my house, graduated with my Masters Degree, and all of that is great, except I traded my passion to do it.  Now it is time to do what I love, and I hope I can inspire you to also do what you love!</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>As with anything there are Risks and Challenges.  I work hard to keep risks to a minimum, but isn't life one big risk!  Now Challenges I can tell you all about those. One major challenge has been finding the time to practice my instruments, finding time to do my scales, and time to train my ear and my voice.  I get around those challenges by sacrificing sleep, because I won't sacrifice time with the kids, although I am able to get some musical instrument practices with them since I put them both in the orchestra!  </p>
<ul>
<li>I am stubborn, so while I have had set backs, I come back from them every time. </li>
<li>I am a hard worker, I am willing to put in the time and the work to be successful, nothing just falls into your lap.</li>
<li>I have pride in what I do, I have in the past posted rough cuts and first passes because everyone knew that was what they were.  I want this album to be something we can all be proud off. I want it to be of the highest quality.</li>
<li>I don't auto tune. There is a great debate about this in the music industry, and it can present a challenge, but I don't auto tune because I want to be authentic, and I want to be able to sing it for you live at a moments notice. </li> <li>Time, time is my biggest challenge, but like I said I am willing to sacrifice sleep, my kids have offered to help so we can still spend time together, and if it works out the right way I plan to take some time off work from at least one of my jobs. </li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p></p>
<p>If you are unable to Pre-order/invest at this time, no worries, you can still help in several  important ways:</p>

I believe in music with all my heart, and I believe it can help people heal, grieve, love and process any array of emotions, Strings of My Heart is all about processing emotions, sometimes moving on, feeling stuck, love, loss and so much more.  A friend once told me to be able to sing and song-write was rare, but it wasn't until recently that I began to see that first hand.  I also had the pleasurable experience of having people reach out and thank me for lyrics that touch them, or helped them and that is what it really all about!  By investing in this project, you aren't just investing in me,  you are investing in anyone who identifies with any of the songs on this album.   This is my first try at crowd funding. This method was suggested by a friend, when we were talking about how I spent every bit of savings I had when I took in the kids because they came to me with nothing. 
I promise you, I will fight to keep this dream alive, I will work hard everyday and I will succeed.  I have succeeded at every other goal I have set for myself.  I bought my car, my motorcycle, my house, graduated with my Masters Degree, and all of that is great, except I traded my passion to do it.  Now it is time to do what I love, and I hope I can inspire you to also do what you love!    Risks & Challenges As with anything there are Risks and Challenges.  I work hard to keep risks to a minimum, but isn't life one big risk!  Now Challenges I can tell you all about those. One major challenge has been finding the time to practice my instruments, finding time to do my scales, and time to train my ear and my voice.  I get around those challenges by sacrificing sleep, because I won't sacrifice time with the kids, although I am able to get some musical instrument practices with them since I put them both in the orchestra!  

I am stubborn, so while I have had set backs, I come back from them every time. 
I am a hard worker, I am willing to put in the time and the work to be successful, nothing just falls into your lap.
I have pride in what I do, I have in the past posted rough cuts and first passes because everyone knew that was what they were.  I want this album to be something we can all be proud off. I want it to be of the highest quality.
I don't auto tune. There is a great debate about this in the music industry, and it can present a challenge, but I don't auto tune because I want to be authentic, and I want to be able to sing it for you live at a moments notice.  Time, time is my biggest challenge, but like I said I am willing to sacrifice sleep, my kids have offered to help so we can still spend time together, and if it works out the right way I plan to take some time off work from at least one of my jobs.     Other Ways You Can Help 
If you are unable to Pre-order/invest at this time, no worries, you can still help in several  important ways:

direct people to my IndieGogo page.
share the campaign video on your FB page.
email your friends and family around the world (this system works the best).
tell music magazines/websites/blogs/other relevant pro's about my project.
tell your friends directly (old school style.... offline). 

Any noise you can make to let others know is a beautiful sound! Thank you! There are wonderful and easily accessed tools on IndieGogo that will help you share this campaign .   If you are still with me and you read through all that, I am truly grateful for your time.  I hope we can journey together and I hope great things are on the horizon!  Thank you so very much, Be Blessed, Namaste and SalutationsMichol Mae",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<br/>
<p>Let me tell you my story. I’ve been singing since childhood. When I went to bed, I was imagining myself on the stage. I listened to the music day and night and I wanted to grow up more quickly to become a singer and dedicate my life to the music. I finished piano study in music school and started to write my own songs. When it came the time to choose the profession, I was thinking about entering the Music College, but my parents advised me to choose another way. Not because they didn’t believe in me, but because they knew that the profession of singer is quite difficult and it’s hard to have a success without money. So I started to learn languages and study Linguistics.</p>
<p>Music hasn’t become my specialty, but it was my strong hobby. I participated in a lot of concerts and competitions. I worked hard, had success and failure and finally I was invited to Ukrainian popular girl’s band. It gave me artistic skills and huge stage experience, but unfortunately the group suspended to give concerts and I had to search my own music path.</p>
<p> It seems to me that the most difficult for musicians is to believe in themselves. You can never know if your music attracts the audience, because music is an Art, either people like it, or not. But I understood the main thing that the musician should be natural and honest. You have to compose the music which takes the beginning from your heart. You should be creative, don’t be afraid to explore the world and make mistakes. Every singer even very famous and talented had failures. You mustn’t loose heart, you should believe in your talent and in your power to make your dream come true. Everyone is individual and special. The problem is that we are afraid to show our ideas, share our thoughts and feelings. I’m not afraid anymore, I’ll do my best and it is my rule.</p>
<p>So my first single Perfect day is my lifestyle. Every day is perfect if we accept it as it comes. I wrote the song Perfect day to address to people who are afraid and don’t feel happy, because they don’t see the beauty of the world.</p>
<p> My first music video is the instrument to share my positive attitude to the life and cheer up this world!</p>

<p>Hello, and welcome to the indiegogo page for United Underground Entertainment. A local production company based in Chico, California. We started down this journey just a few months ago with hopes of bringing the unique culture of festival entertainment to our town of Chico. As spring semester of 2015 came to a close we devised a plan to make that dream a reality. Pooling our unique talents together we organized a small scale festival in downtown Chico called Chicoachella. The event was an absolute success, raising over $1000 for a local artist charity fund. After such a drastic success we knew we couldn't stop there and so the idea for the Chico Downtown festival was born. </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">All of us here at UUE want to bring a full scale festival to Chico, California, and with the recent growth and collaboration within the local music scene, we think that the town is more than ready for just that. There's just one problem with all of this, we're all college students and have bank accounts to reflect such. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">That's where you, the sponsors, come in. Our goal with this campaign is to raise  funds to purchase enough equipment to be able to fully operate our own stage as well as promotional equipment to start spreading the word about United Underground. We are already planning four major fundraising events for next school year as well as a myriad of small scale fundraisers. These events will both raise money for our large scale festival, to be held in spring of 2016,  as well as promote local artists in our very own Chico scene, but, they can't happen without proper equipment. They can't happen without you...</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">So this call goes out to every family member, friend, coworker, teacher and mentor that any of us have ever had.

<li>For this project to be fully funded we need $15,000. Of that 15,000, about 10,000 will go to purchasing all of the equipment that we need to run a stage at a live show as well as purchasing video equipment to create new multimedia content. $2,500 will be used to get UUE merchandise production off of the ground. (Get ready for UUE sunglasses, stickers, T-Shirts and more). $1,900 will be helping us pay all of our final business taxes and filing fees with the IRS, Butte county and the city of Chico, as well as purchase our first three months of venue insurance.

</p><p>Greetings
from Lydia Pense and Cold Blood . We are in the process of recording our new CD
, “Soul Of The Gypsy”</p>
<p>This
is the latest in a long line of albums from Lydia Pense and Cold Blood . It
will be the band's 10<sup>th</sup> album  .</p>
<p>We
have been working on this CD project for two years, recording tracks at River
City Recording in Roseville, CA . We are producing this album independently,
with no financial support from a record label. </p>
<p>  Our goal is to release the CD in late July.
In order to do that we need to raise money to finish the recording, mix the
songs, master the album, have artwork and graphics done and also have the CDs
duplicated and manufactured. We are hoping to raise $7500 to complete all of
this.</p>
<p>  Through 
IndieGoGo you can purchase a personalized, autographed CD ahead of it’s
release . All contributions will go to finishing production of the CD.</p>
<p>  We have some great new original material on
this album and are looking forward to sharing it with all of you ! Thanks for
your support !</p><p><b>Cold Blood Bio:</b></p><p>
</p><p>Lydia Pense &amp; Cold Blood
debuted when the Fillmore was at its peak as one of the nation's musical
Meccas. Owner Bill Graham was so impressed with Lydia's voice and the sound of
the band that he immediately signed Cold Blood to his new record label. During
the span of six original late-60's, early-70's albums, Lydia Pense and Cold
Blood helped, along with Tower Of Power, forge their own specific brand of
funk/soul and R&amp;B which came to be known as East Bay Grease. That music
still holds up today, proving that great music is timeless and will continue to
inspire generations to come. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Cold Blood is one of the
original R&amp;B horn bands from the late 60's/ early 70's that exemplified the
""East Bay Grease"" melding of funk &amp; rock with blues and jazz
elements. Lydia Pense has been compared to Janis Joplin, but is a true original
and a pioneer in the women's rock movement. Lydia Pense and Cold Blood packed
the San Francisco Ballrooms in their heyday, but that was then and this is now.
In the now, Lydia Pense and Cold Blood still fill halls with cheering, dancing,
foot-stomping fans. Far from fading over the years, Cold Blood has flourished. </p>
<p></p>
<p>The word legend certainly
applies to Lydia Pense and Cold Blood…and not in some past
tense-make-a-living-as-an-oldies-act sort of way either. Pense can still shout
like a 60's soul diva and purr a slow blues tune with spine-tingling subtlety.
Cold Blood, as a whole, features a stellar group of musicians who have been
playing together for nearly 20 years including Steve Dunne on guitar, Steve
Salinas on keyboards, a gritty-growling horn section comprised of Rich
Armstrong and Rob Zuckerman along with a stellar rhythm section featuring Evan
Palmerston on bass and Donny Baldwin on drums. The band members are all veteran
Bay Area musicians who have played with many great artists including Elvin
Bishop, Jefferson Starship, Boz Skaggs, Albert Collins and more. Of course there
is Lydia who still has the chops with the patina of a seasoned veteran who's
done and seen it all. Together she and the band continue to twist together
R&amp;B, (both Old School and New School); into something that doesn't have a
label...</p>
<p>Cold Blood has been blessed
with the ability to reach backwards for original influences and the creativity
to reach forward, working with new approaches. The music they play is ageless,
and can still fill any room to the rafters.</p>

tense-make-a-living-as-an-oldies-act sort of way either. Pense can still shout
like a 60's soul diva and purr a slow blues tune with spine-tingling subtlety.
Cold Blood, as a whole, features a stellar group of musicians who have been
playing together for nearly 20 years including Steve Dunne on guitar, Steve
Salinas on keyboards, a gritty-growling horn section comprised of Rich
Armstrong and Rob Zuckerman along with a stellar rhythm section featuring Evan
Palmerston on bass and Donny Baldwin on drums. The band members are all veteran
Bay Area musicians who have played with many great artists including Elvin
Bishop, Jefferson Starship, Boz Skaggs, Albert Collins and more. Of course there
is Lydia who still has the chops with the patina of a seasoned veteran who's
done and seen it all. Together she and the band continue to twist together
R&B, (both Old School and New School); into something that doesn't have a
label...
Cold Blood has been blessed
with the ability to reach backwards for original influences and the creativity
to reach forward, working with new approaches. The music they play is ageless,
and can still fill any room to the rafters.

<h3>The Impact</h3>Our goals and priorities for the <b>""What They Want"" TOUR</b> project is to have the <b>ARTIST</b> <strong>GO ON TOUR, </strong>have her Jump on other <strong>TOURS</strong> already slated, do a ton of <strong>PROMOTIONS </strong>for her while on <strong>TOUR:</strong> from magazines, radio interviews, TV, Concerts, we need to Travel, make hundreds of Appearances, hand out promotional materials, do Promo Shows, get on other promo tours and so on. <br/>I have done this sort of thing for major labels (with big budgets) as a consultant or booking agent an have an excellent track record, and I am constantly learning. This is a really wonderful opportunity to help us continue on our mission at the same time help brand indie music, new talent and most importantly <b>make a teenagers dreams come true.</b> <br/><p>Your contribution will allow to get on as many tours as we can this summer, travel for interviews (TV, RADIO, MAGAZINES), appearances all around the country and even a few dates out of the country. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<div>It's not going to be all butterflies and daisies. We have until May 29th to raise all the funds and start making reservations get flyers printed, CD's Duplicated, Hire Street teas and so on.. so it's a bit of a race. The talent and work ethic is there, but for some reason, magical doors open when you have money. Weird! <br/>
</div>If we could afford to fund all the <strong>PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES</strong> for the <b>""What They Want"" </b>project and <b>MAKE THE ARTISTS DREAMS COME TRUE</b> all on our own, we would. But the truth is... we can’t, especially all at once. In order to <b>go on tour</b> and get her on these other tours by our associates, it’s going to take a village helping us or a NETWORK of people working together as a unit. This is why we are using <b>crowd funding</b> to raise the necessary funds to <b>HELP US</b> run one of the hardest and <b>biggest indie run promo campaigns</b> possible.... we love you guys, we love what we do, and we want you to be part of that with us.<br/>

</h3></div>","In a Nut Shell...

I recently teamed up with an indie label called Eat Breathe sing Entertainment and formed a partnership to put out a single together and do what it takes to try and make their artist Lynda Rose (She just turned 18, Music and singing is her passion. Her dream is, to tour the world, share the stage with other known artists and  bring people together trough her music), a up coming R&B/POP singer, A STAR. If we fail to make her a star, we can at least feel good about putting her on tour, having her do radio interviews, TV show appearances, perform her music in front of thousands of people and MAKING HER DREAMS COME TRUE. The single (features platinum selling artist Maino) and the tour is called ""What They Want"". 


We have spent thousands of dollars on Producing, Writing, Recording sessions, Mixing, Mastering, traveling expenses and so on... and that is just to get the song done (it's only the tip of the iceberg). What we lack at the moment is the rest of the FUNDING to have Lynda Rose go ON TOUR with Maino along with other artists. We are scheduled to have her be one of the opening acts for such artist as: JUICY J, Flo-rida, 2 Chainz,​ Rae Sremmurd, Wale, Yo Gotti with more to be announced. WE WILL NOT BE GETTING PAID for any of these PROMO SHOWS and EVENTS ( artist will be PERFORMING FOR FREE) but, these shows and appearances will put the artist face to face with hundreds of thousands of people. This national Radio and promo tour will allow us to handle probably one of the most important and CRUCIAL parts of the ""What They Want"" project and that's... PROMOTION PROMOTION PROMOTION (We will be  documenting the entire process, to release a ""What They Want"" 2015 PROMO TOUR DVD (Watch our past promo campaigns video example in the gallery).
   What do you think of the song?
CLICK HERE AND LISTEN TO                      ""WHAT THEY WANT""                            From left to right (Maino, Lynda Rose and Producer Chance Uno).

If you like the song, even if you don't like the song, it would mean the world to us if you could contribute in any way you can to HELP US MAKE HER DREAMS COME TRUE.We’re asking you, our friends, COMMUNITY, family and Fans, the lovers of GREAT music that we know you are, to HELP US see our vision through by MAKING A TEENAGERS DREAMS COME TRUE.  Please come along, share, contribute to the 'What They Want' - 2015 PROMO TOUR project, and take this exciting journey with us. We have certain packages set up where, artists, Websites and companies can benefit from all the promotions.  What Do We Need and Why?

$ 10,500.00 - EDM and Reggae remix of the song (In order to reach an even bigger audience, we are going to have have some of the biggest producers in those genres remix the song for us and send to radio opening more doors.).
$ 46,000.00 - Promo Shows and appearances (Events and shows that the artists will not be paid for to be there and we will have to pay out of pocket to satisfy fans, take photos, autograph signings and more).
$ 28,999.00 - PROMO SUV PURCHASE (We will purchase a 2010 GMC Yukon Denali which will be used to travel and transport artists, Dancers, Managers and all necessary promotional material, from banners, flyers, CD's DVD'S, Camera crew and so on.EXAMPLE: From one of our past campaigns. It gives you the basic idea of what we will do with the promo vehicle in order to promote!
$ 4,500.00 - GAS for SUV for the entire length of the promotional period, coast to coast.


$3,400.00 - CD DUPLICATION: (We are duplicating 5000 units, Full Color, CD(s), Jacket with Shrinkwrap for our ""What They Want"" 2015 TOUR promotional Mixtape to hand out FREE at events , shows and concerts.)




The ImpactOur goals and priorities for the ""What They Want"" TOUR project is to have the ARTIST GO ON TOUR, have her Jump on other TOURS already slated, do a ton of PROMOTIONS for her while on TOUR: from magazines, radio interviews, TV, Concerts, we need to Travel, make hundreds of Appearances, hand out promotional materials, do Promo Shows, get on other promo tours and so on. I have done this sort of thing for major labels (with big budgets) as a consultant or booking agent an have an excellent track record, and I am constantly learning. This is a really wonderful opportunity to help us continue on our mission at the same time help brand indie music, new talent and most importantly make a teenagers dreams come true. Your contribution will allow to get on as many tours as we can this summer, travel for interviews (TV, RADIO, MAGAZINES), appearances all around the country and even a few dates out of the country. 

Risks & Challenges
It's not going to be all butterflies and daisies. We have until May 29th to raise all the funds and start making reservations get flyers printed, CD's Duplicated, Hire Street teas and so on.. so it's a bit of a race. The talent and work ethic is there, but for some reason, magical doors open when you have money. Weird! 
If we could afford to fund all the PROMOTIONAL EXPENSES for the ""What They Want"" project and MAKE THE ARTISTS DREAMS COME TRUE all on our own, we would. But the truth is... we can’t, especially all at once. In order to go on tour and get her on these other tours by our associates, it’s going to take a village helping us or a NETWORK of people working together as a unit. This is why we are using crowd funding to raise the necessary funds to HELP US run one of the hardest and biggest indie run promo campaigns possible.... we love you guys, we love what we do, and we want you to be part of that with us.

Austin Gillette-Rhythm Guitar, Isaiah Swift-Lead Vocals, Joel Roeber (forged in the fiery depths of hell)-Lead Guitar/Vocals, Nathan Harms-Drums, and Trent Elizondo-Bass. We've all been playing music for at least 5 years, so we decided to come together to form a band, Amnija. Our first performance was in the winter of 2012, when we took first place in a Gorilla BOB, advancing to the finals and ultimately taking 2nd place. This opened up so many opportunities for us, which has given us the ability to perform numerous shows at venues such as The Hop, The Checkerboard, The Knitting Factory, The Viking Bar and Grill, and The Big Dipper, and continue as a band. Now Juniors (and a freshman) in high school, we're better than ever, and only getting better.<br/></p>
<p>Our goal is to finish production on our first album by June or July. As of now, the album, yet to be named, sits at a litte under halfway done. In order for us to complete it, we need your help! Having only released a four song EP, Temporary Insanity, it is very important to us that we finish a whole album.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are asking for an amount of $1500.00. This will allow us to finish tracking, mixing, and mastering on the album. This will also put a significant dent in the production of physical copies of our album. </p>
<p>What we want to offer to you are physical copies of the new album, shirts, stickers, ""A Special Thanks To..."" credits on the album, and a chance to be heard on the album. </p>
<p>If it happens to be that we don't reach our entire the goal, the money will be prioritized into finishing the tracking, mixing, and mastering of the album.</p>

Now Juniors (and a freshman) in high school, we're better than ever, and only getting better.
Our goal is to finish production on our first album by June or July. As of now, the album, yet to be named, sits at a litte under halfway done. In order for us to complete it, we need your help! Having only released a four song EP, Temporary Insanity, it is very important to us that we finish a whole album.   What We Need & What You Get We are asking for an amount of $1500.00. This will allow us to finish tracking, mixing, and mastering on the album. This will also put a significant dent in the production of physical copies of our album. 
What we want to offer to you are physical copies of the new album, shirts, stickers, ""A Special Thanks To..."" credits on the album, and a chance to be heard on the album. 
If it happens to be that we don't reach our entire the goal, the money will be prioritized into finishing the tracking, mixing, and mastering of the album.

    Other Ways You Can Help We would very much appreciate if you could share this campaign with your friends and family! DOn't forget to use the IndiGogo share tools!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>I have been doing music for over 10 years and I finally took a step in the direction to be the artist I always wanted to be, but never knew I had the capability to become.</p>
<p>With the help of my management team, I have gotten the chance to go down to Arkansas this summer and record the music that I am so incredibly proud of.  </p>

<p>With this Indigogo I am offering rewards from early digital copies of my single to a signed copy of the album and even a spot in my first ever music video. </p>
<p>I can't stress how much every dollar helps. I am doing a feature on Indigogo that lets me keep fundraising even after I reach my goal. Recording an album, shooting a video, doing promo costs a lot of money so anything made over my goal will go right to the project to bring you bigger and better things. </p>
<p>When I began on this journey I knew I could not do this alone. I needed to have not only a great team in place to help make everything physically happen but I would need amazing fans to be a part of this journey from start to finish. I want to have the amazing group of people that believe in me and what I am doing to have a hand in everything I am about to do. </p>
<p>I am more than ready to start making my album but I need help. I know what I need to do but now I need my amazing fans, friends and anyone who is passionate about music to show me what they can do.</p>

<p>So I know all too well that asking for monetary donations is hard for some people. Hey it's hard for me, it's why I need to ask for help. If you can't donate monetarily please donate your time and efforts to spread the word to others who may be able to help monetarily.</p>
<p>Everything helps, whether you tweet about the project for the next 35 days or you donate a dollar. You are so amazing and I will be so grateful that you took the time to help with my journey.

<p>Hey there! </p>
<p>My name is Kim, and I’ve been a musician my whole life. From
piano lessons to high school marching band, and even now as I wrap up my final
semesters getting my Bachelor of Arts in Music, I’ve always found a sense of
purpose in performing, composing, and sharing in music. </p>
<p>It has become clear over the past few months that my next
big step in life has to be to pursue my music career full-time. Having made
this decision, I’m super excited for what my future holds, knowing that I’ll be
pursuing my passion. I love electronic music, so that's what I'm going to produce!</p>
<p>But this path has considerable start-up costs. This campaign
is to raise the funds for the equipment that I need to be able to produce the
kind of music that I love. </p>
<p>I came to the idea of crowdfunding these startup costs
because, ultimately, my music is as much about the community of fans and
supporters as it is about me! I love bringing people together through music,
and having shared experiences through music. Crowdfunding the startup costs
couldn’t have been a better fit with my goals!</p>

Our songwriting process reflected the tension of wanting to be the hands and feet of Jesus in our city, but not really knowing how to do it; and our songs of prayer developed from that posture: </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">From every part of the city, Lord, let Your Kingdom come...</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Will you do something here, Lord, that's never been done before... We've heard all the words, but we need You to show us how...  </i><br/></p>
<p>Our new album, <i>City Psalms Two</i>, will build on the prayers of <i>City Psalms One</i>, but with a deeper emphasis on the conviction that it takes a transformed, unified Church to truly make a difference in our community... <i>We will find our strength in You/ Together as we journey through/ Living Water, come and flow!/ Across the desert we call home</i></p>
<p>So, here's where we need your help:<br/>
<br/>
The music is written and the studio dates are on the calendar, and we need $14,500 to record, master, and duplicate a high-quality, professional album. Every dollar donated will go directly toward the recording and release of <i>City Psalms Two</i>. And in exchange for your generosity there are a number of unique perks on the right side of this page. Also, City Psalms is a project under the direction of 4Tucson, a registered 501c3 non-profit organization, so your contribution is tax-deductible. </p>
<p>You can also support this project by SPREADING THE WORD via Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and email. When we pull this off, we'll be doing it together.</p>
<p>Music is a great unifier, and our hope is that this project will inspire Christians across Tucson to join in singing, writing, and sharing songs of prayer for our hometown. We believe that God responds when we pray, and we want to see His love and mercy sweep across our city like a flood.

Our songwriting process reflected the tension of wanting to be the hands and feet of Jesus in our city, but not really knowing how to do it; and our songs of prayer developed from that posture: From every part of the city, Lord, let Your Kingdom come... Will you do something here, Lord, that's never been done before... We've heard all the words, but we need You to show us how...  
Our new album, City Psalms Two, will build on the prayers of City Psalms One, but with a deeper emphasis on the conviction that it takes a transformed, unified Church to truly make a difference in our community... We will find our strength in You/ Together as we journey through/ Living Water, come and flow!/ Across the desert we call home
So, here's where we need your help:

The music is written and the studio dates are on the calendar, and we need $14,500 to record, master, and duplicate a high-quality, professional album. Every dollar donated will go directly toward the recording and release of City Psalms Two. And in exchange for your generosity there are a number of unique perks on the right side of this page. Also, City Psalms is a project under the direction of 4Tucson, a registered 501c3 non-profit organization, so your contribution is tax-deductible. 
You can also support this project by SPREADING THE WORD via Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and email. When we pull this off, we'll be doing it together.
Music is a great unifier, and our hope is that this project will inspire Christians across Tucson to join in singing, writing, and sharing songs of prayer for our hometown. We believe that God responds when we pray, and we want to see His love and mercy sweep across our city like a flood. Thank you for being willing to invest in this dream alongside us!",0.0,1,"1 Campaign

</div><div>I'm Courtney Hart and I'm embarking on a new journey I want YOU to be a part of! Music has always been a big part of my life and I'm finally ready to share my music with the world!

I'm a big advocate for Mental Healthcare Awareness, because I've had my fair share of hardships and struggled with anxiety and depression.

<p>I have decided to start an online campaign to try and help the people I know and love to get a chance to pre-order and fund my newest release, ""Inland Sea - EP""</p>
<p>The album has taken almost 4 years of effort to complete and it is SO close to being done.  The last step requires the financial support of my friends, family, and fans of my music from around the world.  With your help, I can birth the next best set of music I have produced and share it with the world at large.</p>

<p>I have worked with some of the most talented people I know to get this all wrapped up and we've discovered that with only 100 sales of the physical copy of the album, we can fund the first 200 printings!   </p>
<p>If we get our full goal, we can pay the graphic design costs of around $400, print up the first 200 physical CD's for $300 and 200 album jacks with booklets for $500.  The last $300 will be used to pay for the transportation and other hidden misc. costs associated with releasing music. </p>

</div>
<div>Manufacturing for New Age CD of Instrumental Meditations on Dolphin, Whale, Dragonfly, and Seagull<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>Through my Simple Calming Music project, I wish to launch my concept for ""meditational"" music: the right balance of detail and space. I am focused on recording and distributing music which has enough detail to keep the brain gently engaged and connected (avoiding too much ""drift"") while being light enough to keep from overly distracting the listener. Through my first recordings, I have been able to record music which calms while helping to remain focused; I myself have benefited from these recordings as well while driving, while working, and even while relaxing.</p>
<p>I chose Indiegogo as my platform following a friend's suggestion that I check it out. I am glad he mentioned it to me, as: 1) unlike other more popular/visible funding sites, Indiegogo allows citizens from countries other than the United States (such as myself) to create projects and receive funding, 2) Indiegogo has respectable visibility and is well reviewed online, and 3) again unlike other more popular/visible funding sites, Indiegogo accepts both credit cards and Paypal payments. (Payment flexibility is a very important option to me here, as I am already aware that some potential funders prefer to keep their payment info secret, while others prefer to avoid the additional fees incurred through the use of services like Paypal, and still others do not have a Paypal account).<br/></p>
<p>Through this Indiegogo project, I hope to launch the first CD based on my focus to create and share Simple Calming Music. ""Inner Contacts: Instrumental Meditations on Dolphin, Whale, Dragonfly and Seagull"" is already recorded and mastered (and thus ready for release), and I have already launched the <a href=""http://www.simplecalmingmusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.simplecalmingmusic.com</a> website to promote Simple Calming Music's projects. What remain are the funds to manufacture 500 copies of the CD for distribution and sale, as well as to increase visibility for this and future Simple Calming Music projects. While part of these funds have already been raised, another $800 should cover the remaining cost of manufacturing and shipping from the warehouse to myself. Ultimately, this is pretty much a pre-sale for my album (with most perks containing a CD and/or a digital copy of the album), with smaller perks for those who also wish to contribute but who can only afford to invest less at this time. Should more be raised, I can either increase the number of copies produced from 500 to 1000, or focus on promoting the first CD through targeted online advertising (such as the ones you see on Facebook and Amazon).</p>
<p> Some may be wondering why I don't simply focus on releasing this first project digitally (ie. MP3's and/or other digital audio formats). There are multiple reasons for this:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>While CD sales of popular music have slowly been replaced by digital 
sales through iTunes and other digital distributors, there is still a 
viable market for CDs in genres such as New Age and meditational music. 
This is especially true within the baby boomer generation, which is less
 familiar with digital music distribution and still appreciates having 
actual, tangible copies of their music collection.</li>
<li>
<span>While the online setup and distribution</span><span> costs of digital audio files are absolutely minor when compared to CD duplication and shipping,
 it is my experience that promoting a digital-only release is often more
 difficult than a physical CD release as there is no copy to hold or 
see. While I still will be selling digital copies online through 
retailers such as Amazon, iTunes, CDBaby and others, I will be tying it 
into a physical CD release as well.</span>
</li>
<li>And to put it quite honestly, this is a project I honestly believe 
can recoup its investment and gain sufficient revenue to fund future Simple Calming Music releases. I am thus am putting it forth as my first 
personal, solo CD release. Funding this CD may very well mean that, with one pledge, you will be funding several of my future albums as well!</li>
<li>Having my name on my own CD is a dream I 
share with many a musician, both professional and hobbyist. While I have
 participated in several recordings made by other people for a little over two decades, and have also 
seen my music showcased on compilations, this would be the first project
 pressed to CD that I could call my very own... and that makes a very 
big difference to me. <br/> </li>
</ul>Through CDBaby's Super K Distribution and other affiliates and partnerships, this CD would then be distributed to vendors and clients, virtually worldwide.<br/><br/>(For more information on the album creation process itself, and on Simple Calming Music, check out my pitch video accompanying this campaign.)<br/><br/> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Here's basically what the project entails:</p> <ul> <li>I have a history of over ten years' experience in album artwork design and layout, as well as over fifteen years' experience in studio recording and over twenty years' experience in public musical performance. The album's recording stage is complete, and the album has been mastered by a professional sound engineer with whom I have a long-standing relationship. (And for the duration of this Indiegogo campaign, you can hear the entire album online at: <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/glenbourgeois/full-preview-inner-contacts-instrumental-meditations-on-dolphin-whale-dragonfly-seagull/s-nAxh5"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://soundcloud.com/glenbourgeois/full-preview-inner-contacts-instrumental-meditations-on-dolphin-whale-dragonfly-seagull/s-nAxh5</a> <span>)</span>
</li>
<li>The digital distribution has already been secured and paid for through CDBaby, a most reputable company which regularly submits a wealth of material simultaneously to digital retailers such as iTunes and Amazon, as well as online streaming services such as Deezer, Sony Music Unlimited and Spotify.</li>
<li>What remains is to do the album artwork design and layout (again, for which I have fifteen years' experience working on other people's professional projects, at negligible cost to myself), and the manufacturing and shipment of 500 CD copies (which has been quoted for a total of approximately $1200). As I have already saved up almost $400 of my own for the project, what remains is $800 which will go directly to the manufacturing of my first solo CD project, the album, ""Inner Contacts: Instrumental Meditations on Dolphin, Whale, Dragonfly and Seagull"".<br/>
</li> <li>The perks include digital copies of the entire album (in either MP3 or high-resolution 24-bit/44.1-kHz WAV/FLAC formats; more formats may become available, subject to demand), physical CD copies of the album (as well as CD/digital file combinations, all with standard, single CD postage via Canadapost included in the perk), bonus instrumental digital tracks from my previous, similarly-themed work for Kimspirational's album ""YES! YES! YES!"" (note: these are only the instrumental versions; Kimspirational remains the owner of the versions including her voice and guided meditations), extra digital tracks from the instrumental digital albums previously released by myself (such as ""Home: A Reflection"" and ""Eau de Pâques/Easter Water"", even more extra digital tracks from the forthcoming instrumental album ""Sun and Storms""... and all funders will be listed (unless otherwise requested) in the Thank You section within the album credits.<br/>
</li> <li>Ideally, I have kept the funding goal as small as possible to ensure success while meeting all the immediately required costs for this CD to see the light of day (and further pressings can be funded through the sale of the first 500 copies). For example, this goal can easily be met if 40 people contribute $20 apiece (for which they would receive a physical copy of the CD, as well as a digital MP3 copy of the album as soon as the Indiegogo campaign is complete),</li>
<li>If the $800 Indiegogo goal is not reached, all monies raised will be invested into the manufacture of the CD once I have secured funding (either through my own funds or through private investors/loans) to cover the entire manufacturing costs. The album will still be launched digitally at the end of the Indiegogo campaign, and any digital download perks will still be available on time. Any funds received through further digital sales of the album would go towards covering manufacturing costs of the CD, until $800 is amassed.<br/>
</li>
<li>Should the Indiegogo campaign surpass the $800 goal, any extra monies will be invested in online targeted advertising through partners such as Amazon and Facebook, as well as in physically distributing copies of the CD to retailers for consignment/sale. Should the goal be surpassed by a sizeable amount (ie. above $1300 total), I may elect to manufacture an extra 500 copies for my first pressing in addition to the original 500, making for 1000 copies.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3> <p>This being my initial Simple Calming Music release, it is important that I make the strongest possible impact.<br/></p> <ul> <li>The success of this project will permit me to record and release further albums in the Simple Calming Music vein. If you like music like this (and I presume you do if you're reading this), then you can look forward to getting more of it from me!</li>
<li>While CD copies will be made available for future Simple Calming Music projects as long as there is a feasible market, the increased visibility of future releases (thanks to the availability of this first one in both digital audio file and CD formats) will make it easier for future projects to recoup investment and see heightened sales. This may possibly lead to increased digital sales, which would thus lessen the requirement for physical CD copies, or at the least, allow for future albums with reduced packaging (such as digipaks, ""CD wallets"" and single sleeves)... either way, reducing the impact on the environment! <br/>
</li> <li>I have over ten years' experience in album artwork design and layout for professionally recorded and manufactured CD's, with all my clients expressing only satisfaction for my work (and some being repeat clients). <br/>
</li>
<li>The album is already completely recorded and mastered (and can be heard at <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/glenbourgeois/full-preview-inner-contacts-instrumental-meditations-on-dolphin-whale-dragonfly-seagull"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://soundcloud.com/glenbourgeois/full-preview-inner-contacts-instrumental-meditations-on-dolphin-whale-dragonfly-seagull</a> ). In short, it already exists in full: it just needs to be packaged, manufactured, and released. And with your help, I can accomplish this goal without breaking the bank or eating packaged pasta or ramen noodles for months (and I'm not criticizing anyone who enjoys regularly eating packaged pasta or ramen noodles... just saying).<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>While there are very limited risks involved in the manufacture of a CD of original music, there are far more obstacles in promoting this project once completed.</p> <ul> <li>It is commonly known that the music industry playing field has levelled in recent years, with the arrival of the Internet, digital sales, and the affordability of decent home recording equipment and software, not to mention partners such as CDBaby and DiscMakers. While it is easier to produce one's own album and have it professionally manufactured, this has also made it more difficult for any one artist or album to stand out amongst the myriad of albums being released each year.<br/>
</li> <li>I have already identified several vendors who specialize in New Age and meditational products, and have solicited interest in carrying my album in their stores. (I am also open to other stores as well, should any potential funders here know of any.)</li>
<li>I have also begun to negotiate promotional agreements with online specialists and services which cater to markets identified as being interested in New Age and meditation. (This means you may hear my music appear in unexpected places: fear not, as I am happily making arrangements such as these... though you are always welcome to let me know where you heard my music!)</li>
<li>A New Age/meditational music has a much longer ""shelf life"" than the average commercial recording. Much as a Christmas album or a ""Greatest Hits/Best Of"" album, a New Age/meditational album stands a strong chance of continued sales way past its original release date, as people interested in these specific types of albums rarely base their purchases on chart positions or the original release date of an album of this genre. This means the manufactured CD copies retain their value over consecutive years and still remain in relatively similar demand, as long as the album is promoted and made available for purchase. You can rest assured that these CDs will be free from any threat of mass destruction past a specific future date... these copies are good until sold or procured. <br/>
</li>
<li>Links to digital copies are only as secure as the practices of those who have access to those digital copies. I will be exploring the best possible model of making digital copies available for easy download (MP3 and WAV/FLAC, with other possibilities according to demand) at least cost and frustration. However, while certain platforms/vendors such as iTunes digitally encrypt information into the MP3s identifying who purchased them, I may have to make my files available in a way that virtually anyone who gets their hands on the download link can access the whole album, or that anyone can then make copies or otherwise share. (While some view this as ""promoting"" an artist, and I will admit to having downloaded albums and then buying CD copies soon afterwards, this method of ""promotion"" doesn't usually result in a huge amount of sales, to my knowledge.) This is where I may just have to trust everyone who gets a download link, for the sake of making things easy for everyone downloading a digital copy of the album.<br/>
</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>As Indiegogo has reminded me, some people just can't contribute, but they can still help otherwise! Should you be one of these people, feel free to:<br/></p> <ul> <li>Get the word out to those you feel would be interested in this project... give the link on your blog, on your Facebook wall, in online mailing list groups, to your yoga class... the sky's the limit!<br/>
</li> <li>Remember the Indiegogo share tools! These make it easy to share the word (and a link) for my Indiegogo campaign. Every bit helps!<br/>

NEW PERKS ADDED: Behind-the-Scenes on the Next Simple Calming Music CD, and My Keyboards on Your Song! 

Project Goal

 I have already identified several vendors who specialize in New Age and meditational products, and have solicited interest in carrying my album in their stores. (I am also open to other stores as well, should any potential funders here know of any.)

Much as a Christmas album or a ""Greatest Hits/Best Of"" album, a New Age/meditational album stands a strong chance of continued sales way past its original release date, as people interested in these specific types of albums rarely base their purchases on chart positions or the original release date of an album of this genre. This means the manufactured CD copies retain their value over consecutive years and still remain in relatively similar demand, as long as the album is promoted and made available for purchase. You can rest assured that these CDs will be free from any threat of mass destruction past a specific future date... these copies are good until sold or procured. 

Links to digital copies are only as secure as the practices of those who have access to those digital copies. I will be exploring the best possible model of making digital copies available for easy download (MP3 and WAV/FLAC, with other possibilities according to demand) at least cost and frustration. However, while certain platforms/vendors such as iTunes digitally encrypt information into the MP3s identifying who purchased them, I may have to make my files available in a way that virtually anyone who gets their hands on the download link can access the whole album, or that anyone can then make copies or otherwise share. (While some view this as ""promoting"" an artist, and I will admit to having downloaded albums and then buying CD copies soon afterwards, this method of ""promotion"" doesn't usually result in a huge amount of sales, to my knowledge.) This is where I may just have to trust everyone who gets a download link, for the sake of making things easy for everyone downloading a digital copy of the album.

<div>Introducing millagram</div>
<div>Born and raised in Nova Scotia, Canada, millagram is cut from Traditional Folk fabric and sewn with Jazz. Her years spent in a bustling metropolis as an adult, exposed her to many genres that she fell in love with including Reggae, R&amp;B, Hip Hop and Electronic music. While her heart was always in the underground, she couldn't help but love the Greats; artists who brought something new and profound to otherwise generic mainstream music. There are many artists who have left a real impression on her soul and millagram hopes that her music will do the same for you. She writes about her own life experiences and reflections of her mind, setting vulnerability aside to share her heart with the world. </div>
<div>Introducing Nø Fåuxs</div>
<div>Dason Johnson is a Mastermind--No a polymath. I've never met another like him. His drive is multilayerd and complex but exacting and efficatious in the utmost. His skills are continously improving and his creativity is beyond description. In short Dason Johnson is a living zeitgest, a barely contained time-bomb of whirling energy and fantastical talent. <br/>
</div>
<div>The Campaign</div>
<div>Great minds sync alike. That's what happened when Nø Fåuxs and Millagram finally sat down and shared music. After two months of sharing and writing, this EP was conceived. They can't wait to share it with the world so we need your help to cover some of the production costs to be able to birth this project.

This is an independent release and we would like you, the fans to have your stake in their future careers. So let's get the ball rolling!</div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We are looking to raise $2000 for this project. Most of the work has already been done: the beats are made, the songs are ready to be recorded. When you donate you will be contributing directly to the cost of studio rental for the vocal tracks and the mixing and mastering of the entire EP. Pretty simple stuff, but stuff that takes cash. </p>

<p><b>Our History:</b>  One summer
evening while listening to some music after writing a review for my website
Mundo Rock &amp; Heavy, and also appreciate long after the work of metal bands
here in Chile since my 15 years old (now I’m in my 37), I understood the great
potential of the new Chilean wave of Heavy Metal bands. I got a vision in order
to create some refreshing musical effort, guided under two points of view: 1)
Show to the world these new bands, such as Battlerage, Caterina Nix, Iron Spell,
Thunder Lord, Eternal Thirst, Resilience, Evil Fire, Vastator, SteelRage and
many others, with all his big talent, and 2) Pay tribute to the their roots
with all whose old names, maybe not so popular and big as the typical Iron
Maiden, Judas Priest or Metallica, but still delivering a great dosis of true
heavy metal sounds over the decades, and specially in the crazy 80s age. How
you can not hallucinate when you hear the old times with bands such as Omen,
Griffin, Tyrant, Warbride, Grim Reaper, Angel Witch, Running Wild, Heavy Load,
etc etc etc.?? Well, I think this is the time, this is the age for the first
Chilean Tribute to the 80s Heavy Metal.</p><p><br/></p>
<p><b>The Project:</b> The music will be
recorded in many studios, according the needs and tastes of every band, then
we’ll take every song to bring it into a unique mix and mastering process.By contributing to this campaign, you will support us 100% without any
help from any label and allow us to spread the Chilean metal scene over the
world. Since the first pressing CD only will have a limited edition with 1.000
units, we’ll be open to receive any offering for an eventual license o
distribution agreement.</p>
<p>Musicians from all over
the world know it: To record and release an album is not  easy, over all if you are from a so distant
and not so known country as Chile. All this is an independent project trying to
join some musicians and people around one common idea: to promote the Chilean
heavy metal bands showing all their love for the classic sounds. The good heavy
metal not just is coming from USA or Europe, so give the chance to spread some
good  and news names in the heavy metal
battlefield. </p><p style=""text-align: justify;""><b>Our goal: </b>It's quite a lot of money for us (not even this goal of almost <b>U$9.678</b> will be enough, but will help!! Hopefully we'll surpass it!!) and we can only get this done with the help of many of you, We know how difficult is try to coming out from the underground with a so ambitious project like this!!<b> </b>Now you can support this idea and get your double CD.

</div></div>","ENGLISH VERSION:
Our History:  One summer
evening while listening to some music after writing a review for my website
Mundo Rock & Heavy, and also appreciate long after the work of metal bands
here in Chile since my 15 years old (now I’m in my 37), I understood the great
potential of the new Chilean wave of Heavy Metal bands. I got a vision in order
to create some refreshing musical effort, guided under two points of view: 1)
Show to the world these new bands, such as Battlerage, Caterina Nix, Iron Spell,
Thunder Lord, Eternal Thirst, Resilience, Evil Fire, Vastator, SteelRage and
many others, with all his big talent, and 2) Pay tribute to the their roots
with all whose old names, maybe not so popular and big as the typical Iron
Maiden, Judas Priest or Metallica, but still delivering a great dosis of true
heavy metal sounds over the decades, and specially in the crazy 80s age. How
you can not hallucinate when you hear the old times with bands such as Omen,
Griffin, Tyrant, Warbride, Grim Reaper, Angel Witch, Running Wild, Heavy Load,
etc etc etc.?? Well, I think this is the time, this is the age for the first
Chilean Tribute to the 80s Heavy Metal.
The Project: The music will be
recorded in many studios, according the needs and tastes of every band, then
we’ll take every song to bring it into a unique mix and mastering process.By contributing to this campaign, you will support us 100% without any
help from any label and allow us to spread the Chilean metal scene over the
world. Since the first pressing CD only will have a limited edition with 1.000
units, we’ll be open to receive any offering for an eventual license o
distribution agreement.
Musicians from all over
the world know it: To record and release an album is not  easy, over all if you are from a so distant
and not so known country as Chile. All this is an independent project trying to
join some musicians and people around one common idea: to promote the Chilean
heavy metal bands showing all their love for the classic sounds. The good heavy
metal not just is coming from USA or Europe, so give the chance to spread some
good  and news names in the heavy metal
battlefield. Our goal: It's quite a lot of money for us (not even this goal of almost U$9.678 will be enough, but will help!! Hopefully we'll surpass it!!) and we can only get this done with the help of many of you, We know how difficult is try to coming out from the underground with a so ambitious project like this!! Now you can support this idea and get your double CD. How? Check
it out:

</p><p><b>DARLINGS, WE’RE
MAKING A NEW ALBUM!</b></p>
<p>That’s right. It has been <b>FIVE LONG YEARS </b>since I (Felix) emerged
from my parents’ attic clutching the weird little solo album that would start
us off on this journey of theatre and rock. Two more EP’s, loads of ridiculous
videos, hundreds of gigs around the country, a million box-steps, dozens of
beautiful outfits and a metric tonne of makeup later, and we’re ready to get in
the studio to make our magnum opus. Since the release of our first EP as a full
band we’ve been bashing away at our sound, injecting the fearsome exuberance of
the theatre into modern rock and pop. And this album will be our grand
statement, our big push. And like all our output, it only works if you folks
are involved. </p>
<p><b>WE’RE ASKING FOR
FUNDING TO HELP US MAKE THIS RECORD. BUT WHY? </b></p>
<p>Ten grand. That sounds like an awful lot. Where the hell is it going? </p>
<p>I’m glad you asked. We are a completely independent artistic unit, with
none of that sweet sweet label money to pay for things. However this means we
can just go ahead and come straight to you beautiful people, and make something
together! In actual fact this is only HALF of the budget required to actually
get the record out there. Because once the record is made, we must engage
things like a PR company, distributor and radio plugger, not to mention finance
a load more of our marvelous videos, merchandise and physical CDs. But that’s
all the boring stuff. We’ll take care of that ourselves. We’d like you to help
with the fun bit! So this is what the money will be spent on:</p>
<p><b>PAY THE PRODUCER</b></p>
<p>You know the producer. It’s our boy Joe Davison. He has done the last two
records and is the bestest damn producer in the world. But the last couple of short
EPs were made in very time-limited circumstances (the last one was recorded in
five days in an attic) for no money and with everyone staying up all night
after work for months getting it finished. For this, our biggest thing ever, we
need to dedicate proper time to the process to make such a BIG project happen.
So Joe is going to move up here to Manchester and we’re gonna spend a month
together building the record from the ground up. No distractions, no pressing
needs to buy food or pay rent. Joy! </p>
<p><b>PAY THE MUSICIANS</b></p>
<p>We’re going big on this one, folks. We’re gonna enlist the help of all
the wonderful musicians we have met over the years – horn sections, string
sections, all the really cool expensive stuff that makes GREAT records. And we
believe that musicians, who have dedicated their lives to mastering a skill and
bring magic to whatever they touch deserve to get paid for their time. </p>
<p><b>HIRE A STUDIO</b></p>
<p>No more attics this time, darlings. We’re gonna take over a beautiful
studio in Manchester and build this thing in a proper, purpose-built
environment to make it sound as wonderful as possible. </p>
<p><b>AND THAT’S IT!</b></p>
<p><b>BUT WAIT!</b></p>
<p>The best part is we are offering all kinds of marvelous things in return
for your invaluable support. And luckily we are able to draw on the
considerable resources of our various talents and professions to give you some
truly unique perks. Like cake? Of course you do! Well our Ellie is a master
baker of tremendous towers of cakey magnificence. And she’ll do one of her
custom masterpieces just for you. Ever wondered what your own theme tune would
sound like? Wonder no more! I (Felix) shall consult with you at length, divine
your superhero name, powers and requisite sidekicks, and produce your own song
to play whenever you are getting ready for a big meeting, first date or
preparing to save people from a burning building. Wanna come to the best gig of
your life? Well you can! We’ll be holding two extra special launch parties in
London and my (actual) family’s very own brand new ballroom in Manchester.
These nights will be stuffed with the finest talent we can assemble from every performance
discipline, and will be capped by a special performance from us. Want to have a
gig in your house? BOOM. Pledge a bit of cash and I’ll come and play in your
living room. We shall sing and dance the night away. Pledge a bit more and I’ll

the cost of an album is so gargantuan these days that we simply don’t have
enough to both a) make a gigantic wonderful-sounding record, and b) make sure

<br/></div>","DARLINGS, WE’RE
MAKING A NEW ALBUM!
That’s right. It has been FIVE LONG YEARS since I (Felix) emerged
from my parents’ attic clutching the weird little solo album that would start
us off on this journey of theatre and rock. Two more EP’s, loads of ridiculous
videos, hundreds of gigs around the country, a million box-steps, dozens of
beautiful outfits and a metric tonne of makeup later, and we’re ready to get in
the studio to make our magnum opus. Since the release of our first EP as a full
band we’ve been bashing away at our sound, injecting the fearsome exuberance of
the theatre into modern rock and pop. And this album will be our grand
statement, our big push. And like all our output, it only works if you folks
are involved. 
WE’RE ASKING FOR
FUNDING TO HELP US MAKE THIS RECORD. BUT WHY? 
Ten grand. That sounds like an awful lot. Where the hell is it going? 
I’m glad you asked. We are a completely independent artistic unit, with
none of that sweet sweet label money to pay for things. However this means we
can just go ahead and come straight to you beautiful people, and make something
together! In actual fact this is only HALF of the budget required to actually
get the record out there. Because once the record is made, we must engage
things like a PR company, distributor and radio plugger, not to mention finance
a load more of our marvelous videos, merchandise and physical CDs. But that’s
all the boring stuff. We’ll take care of that ourselves. We’d like you to help
with the fun bit! So this is what the money will be spent on:
PAY THE PRODUCER
You know the producer. It’s our boy Joe Davison. He has done the last two
records and is the bestest damn producer in the world. But the last couple of short
EPs were made in very time-limited circumstances (the last one was recorded in
five days in an attic) for no money and with everyone staying up all night
after work for months getting it finished. For this, our biggest thing ever, we
need to dedicate proper time to the process to make such a BIG project happen.
So Joe is going to move up here to Manchester and we’re gonna spend a month
together building the record from the ground up. No distractions, no pressing
needs to buy food or pay rent. Joy! 
PAY THE MUSICIANS
We’re going big on this one, folks. We’re gonna enlist the help of all
the wonderful musicians we have met over the years – horn sections, string
sections, all the really cool expensive stuff that makes GREAT records. And we
believe that musicians, who have dedicated their lives to mastering a skill and
bring magic to whatever they touch deserve to get paid for their time. 
HIRE A STUDIO
No more attics this time, darlings. We’re gonna take over a beautiful
studio in Manchester and build this thing in a proper, purpose-built
environment to make it sound as wonderful as possible. 
AND THAT’S IT!
BUT WAIT!
The best part is we are offering all kinds of marvelous things in return
for your invaluable support. And luckily we are able to draw on the
considerable resources of our various talents and professions to give you some
truly unique perks. Like cake? Of course you do! Well our Ellie is a master
baker of tremendous towers of cakey magnificence. And she’ll do one of her
custom masterpieces just for you. Ever wondered what your own theme tune would
sound like? Wonder no more! I (Felix) shall consult with you at length, divine
your superhero name, powers and requisite sidekicks, and produce your own song
to play whenever you are getting ready for a big meeting, first date or
preparing to save people from a burning building. Wanna come to the best gig of
your life? Well you can! We’ll be holding two extra special launch parties in
London and my (actual) family’s very own brand new ballroom in Manchester.
These nights will be stuffed with the finest talent we can assemble from every performance
discipline, and will be capped by a special performance from us. Want to have a
gig in your house? BOOM. Pledge a bit of cash and I’ll come and play in your
living room. We shall sing and dance the night away. Pledge a bit more and I’ll
bring the whole damn Family along with me, and we shall shake the heavens with
our mighty roar. 
All this plus downloads, limited edition t-shirts, bundles and more.
Check out the perks! 
WHAT IF WE DON’T
MAKE THE WHOLE AMOUNT?
Luckily this isn’t an “all or nothing” situation. We have various
milestones as the pledges come in, so whatever happens this album is gonna get
made. Even if we have to just yell it into a Dictaphone. But the more we get,
the BIGGER we can go!

<li>
<b>CD Manufacturing</b> - Although CD sales have been diminishing rapidly over the past decade, surprisingly the vast majority of my album sales come from physical copies sold at gigs.  This income stream is vital to help me regenerate the money I invest in recording and releasing new material and allows me to get back into the studio sooner rather than later; meaning I can create more music more often that you’re hopefully going to love!</li>
<li>
<b>Promotion and Marketing</b> - With the new digital age of music it has in many ways become very easy to reach new audiences all over the world.  The only pitfall is that now there is so much new music being created and released everyday that it can be difficult to get heard amongst all of the noise.  Unsurprisingly YouTube has become one of the most popular search engines in the world and is now the way that many people are discovering new artists and great new music.  Therefore some of the money raised will also go towards creating a number of new music videos and lyric videos for the tracks off my new EP.</li>
<li>
<b>UK / Irish / Worldwide Touring</b> - The thing I love most about being a musician is being able to travel the world and meet interesting people like you.  But that can cost a lot of money too!  Therefore any money leftover from the campaign shall be put to good use by helping to book trains, planes and automobiles so I can bring my music to a venue near you!</li>

I'm a poet and I try to use poetry to entertain, but also to make the world a better place! Last year my poem ""Shorty"" went viral.

<p>...so now I want to extend the message.I want to do for all forms of body shaming what Shorty did for Penis Anxiety. I want us to create a collaborative CD with a range of artists, not just me and not just poetry. I want to tackle (and defeat) a range of body image concerns (not just penis anxiety). I want to make Body Positivity THE conversation of 2016. I want our celebration of ourselves to be heard on radio stations and TV channels around the world. Just like Shorty was - but this time touching the lives of many, many millions.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need</h3> <p>I already have a collective of very exciting artists involved tackling
all forms of shaming, be that weight, height, penis size or shape, body hair,
eczema or gender confusion… any and all forms of bullying people for how they
look, for who they are. While I'm funding for the project we'll be looking for more contributions from artists. So if you are a musician, poet, rapper, comedian etc who cares about the subject - feel free to message me for details on how to send tracks over.</p>
<p>We're looking to release a compilation album and host a launch event in London. All funds go to these endeavours, none of the artists involved are paid for their contributions. This is a not-for-profit project. We're looking to spread the body-positive message above all else.</p>
<p>If we don't reach the target, then we'll scale back on the number of CDs we press and the scale of the launch event. We will still be able to release the collaboration album though - it's just a question of scale.</p>

</div><div> <p></p>
<p>Body shaming
has become an everyday occurrence. There's a constant stream of celebrity headlines

</div></div>","Hi, I'm Ant Smith. I'm a poet and I try to use poetry to entertain, but also to make the world a better place! Last year my poem ""Shorty"" went viral. It's a body-positivity piece, tackling the concern of Penis Size Anxiety. It was very, very effective...

...so now I want to extend the message.I want to do for all forms of body shaming what Shorty did for Penis Anxiety. I want us to create a collaborative CD with a range of artists, not just me and not just poetry. I want to tackle (and defeat) a range of body image concerns (not just penis anxiety). I want to make Body Positivity THE conversation of 2016. I want our celebration of ourselves to be heard on radio stations and TV channels around the world. Just like Shorty was - but this time touching the lives of many, many millions.   What We Need I already have a collective of very exciting artists involved tackling
all forms of shaming, be that weight, height, penis size or shape, body hair,
eczema or gender confusion… any and all forms of bullying people for how they
look, for who they are. While I'm funding for the project we'll be looking for more contributions from artists. So if you are a musician, poet, rapper, comedian etc who cares about the subject - feel free to message me for details on how to send tracks over.
We're looking to release a compilation album and host a launch event in London. All funds go to these endeavours, none of the artists involved are paid for their contributions. This is a not-for-profit project. We're looking to spread the body-positive message above all else.
If we don't reach the target, then we'll scale back on the number of CDs we press and the scale of the launch event. We will still be able to release the collaboration album though - it's just a question of scale.
What Will Be Achieved
 
Body shaming
has become an everyday occurrence. There's a constant stream of celebrity headlines
as 'fat' jibes are traded for 'small penis' insults. They make for easy
ratings-boosting headlines, and it all seems so inconsequential in the backdrop
of wars and austerity. But behind the headlines there is day to day misery for
millions as we drive each other into depression, and even suicide.
My experience over the last year has taught me that if we refuse to be shamed, if we are open and honest about who we are, if we celebrate ourselves then we eradicate misery. I've given interviews around the world to millions of readers/listeners/viewers on the concern of penis size anxiety and the response has been 99.999% positive. People who have been in deep despair have written to me and told me what a difference it makes, for one person to stand up and say ""I'm this too, and I own it"".
And that's just one of the many, many body image concerns we're living with.
By supporting this project you can make a real difference to the quality of life of people across the world.  And when you look at any of the statistics that means, this project can benefit your siblings, your friends, your colleagues, maybe even yourself - whether you're aware of such issues today or not.

Of course this comes at a greater cost to the artist, while we have a good amount of our own skin in the game we are reaching out to you to help us fund the record. 
We don't expect something for nothing so we have some killer Perks lined up. From pre orders of the new CD (signed of course), exclusive Live downloads, Guitars, Harmonicas, heck we will even play at your house!
When fully funded we will be able to finish paying production costs, have the final tracks mastered and ready for duplication. If you know the Conqueroos you know we are driven to create music so this record WILL BE MADE, your contributions will help us get the record done on schedule and will help it to be THE BEST CONQUEROOS RECORD YET!

We just wrapped up an Indie GoGo campaign for this project, but would like to continue raising funds as production begins! With the help of investors, we are only about $2k shy of our goal.

My Grammy-winning producer Robert Eibach has projected that we can definitely hit Billboard with my new single, so now it's just a matter of raising the final funds to complete the song!

I began my musical journey with your help in Minneapolis, Minnesota when I released my debut EP titled The Night last year. Being an independent artist through this journey has been such a rewarding experience, and I now wish to continue my momentum into 2016! I have made great connections with grammy-winning artists David Longoria and Robert Eibach who wish to help me on this journey by finding all the right ties to get my new record to the Billboard Charts. They've helped quite a few other artists hit Billboard in the past! So, what does it take to get to the billboard charts? Mostly MONEY (Yeah I know, corporatism sucks), professional promotion, and a killer song! In exchange for your donation (or t-shirt order, etc.), I will be giving you a personal, behind-the-scenes look at how I create the song, how the song gets produced, and many other details that go into my journey to the Billboard Charts!

<li>We need to hire a big time promoter, who will help us get the song played in clubs and on various radio stations.

<li>There are other promotional costs, such as ads on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and various other platforms. </li>
<li>We need to create and ship all of the Perks to you! These perks are exclusive to Indie Gogo donors, so all the T-Shirts, early access to music, and other goodies will be for your ears and eyes only. </li>
<li>Most money gets spent on the high quality production, which includes: studio time, musician fees, and producer/remixer fees (Differently styled remixes will get played in different clubs, expanding Lauren Nikohl's audience). Big time producers need big time money if you want to work with them, so your donations will be supporting the amazing quality of production that is necessary for this record to hit the charts.</li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>The rise of streaming services and download services such as Spotify and LimeWire make it very difficult for musicians to generate any profit these days from making their music. That is why so many artists are turning to crowd funding, where their fans can connect directly with the process of making the product, and access exclusive merchandise in lieu of supporting the artist from the beginning of a project. It gives a fan ownership in the career of an artist they believe in as well as an exclusive inside look into the whole record making process. <em>By pre-ordering any Perk item $5+ and supporting my new record,</em> you will get an <strong>all access pass</strong> to exclusive behind the scenes footage and updates that no one else will get to see, like videos of us in the studio, sneak peaks of new material, and other surprises. Fans and artists are now better connected ever before, and it means a lot to me for you to support my goals and my artistry! </p><p>My goal as an artist is to bring a whole new wave of mindfulness, innovation, and determination in the music industry. I hope to introduce optimistic, thought-provoking, and motivational messages into popular music to inspire young generations to come in challenging the status quo, and finding oneself along life's journey. It is my wish to spend my whole life creating and performing, all while making positive and lasting social impact.</p><p>As previously mentioned, I already successfully produced an EP with the help of crowd funding, so I believe in its communal power. Any donation helps. YOU can make a huge impact for my career in music, and it will not be forgotten! </p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:</p><ul>
<li>You can get the word out and make some noise about this campaign on social media. Use those Indie Gogo share tools!</li>
<li>Message/Email all of your friends and ask them to follow Lauren Nikohl on Spotify, Facebook, SoundCloud, Instagram, and spread the word about her as a recording artist. Maybe even share a YouTube video to help her gain a larger audience!</li>
</ul><div>Thank you all so much for your efforts in this process. It is with a humble heart that I accept your financial support in this time of my music career, and I will never go a day in my life without being grateful for all of the support I have already received in order to pursue my dreams!<p></p>

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p><a href=""http://www.theresponseproject.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Response Project</a> is a commissioning initiative, lead by pianist Brianna Matzke, that seeks to create brand new works for the piano. Each set of pieces is created by asking composers to write music for the piano (and sometimes other instruments too) in response to a preexisting artwork or idea.</p>
<p>This is the fundraising campaign to support the second phase of the project.</p>
<p>This Response Project will create seven innovative pieces for piano + violin, written by seven young composers in response to one simple phrase:</p>
<p>ON BEHALF</p>
<p>Composers have been invited to consider<br/>- how this phrase impacts them personally, politically, and/or artistically<br/>- potential manifestations of the phrase within musical composition<br/>- what this phrase means within the context of musical performance</p>
<p>This phrase ""ON BEHALF"" was drawn from the following exchange between <strong>Killer Mike</strong> and <strong>Stephen Colbert</strong> on <strong>The Tonight Show:</strong></p>
<div>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/JhudugDROn0?t=2m18s?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<div> </div>
</div>
<div>Each of our seven composers have chosen to speak ""on behalf"" of an idea, person, community, or condition. Response examples include:</div>
<div>- ON BEHALF of disability</div>
<div>- ON BEHALF of my two Southern grandmothers</div>
<div>- ON BEHALF of metaphor</div>
<div>- ON BEHALF of Earth's future residents</div>
<div>- ON BEHALF of Edward Snowden and other NSA whistleblowers</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When the project has been fully funded, the pieces will receive two premieres:</div>
<div>
<i>World Premiere:</i> <strong>Tribeca New Music Festival</strong> in New York City at <strong>the cell theatre </strong>
</div>
<div>
<i>Cincinnati Premiere: </i><strong>Contemporary Art Center Black Box Theater</strong> in collaboration with <a href=""http://facebook.com/chasepublic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chase Public</a>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Beyond the creation and premiere of seven new works, we are making a studio recording of the pieces, with album art by <strong>John Lee. </strong>You can see more of his work <a href=""http://johnleedraws.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Your support will make the following possible:<br/>- commissioning our composers and artists</div>
<div>- booking venues and producing publicity</div>
<div>- recording and releasing the studio album</div>

This Response Project will create seven innovative pieces for piano + violin, written by seven young composers in response to one simple phrase:
ON BEHALF
Composers have been invited to consider- how this phrase impacts them personally, politically, and/or artistically- potential manifestations of the phrase within musical composition- what this phrase means within the context of musical performance
This phrase ""ON BEHALF"" was drawn from the following exchange between Killer Mike and Stephen Colbert on The Tonight Show:


 

Each of our seven composers have chosen to speak ""on behalf"" of an idea, person, community, or condition. Response examples include:
- ON BEHALF of disability
- ON BEHALF of my two Southern grandmothers
- ON BEHALF of metaphor
- ON BEHALF of Earth's future residents
- ON BEHALF of Edward Snowden and other NSA whistleblowers
 
When the project has been fully funded, the pieces will receive two premieres:

World Premiere: Tribeca New Music Festival in New York City at the cell theatre 


Cincinnati Premiere: Contemporary Art Center Black Box Theater in collaboration with Chase Public

 
Beyond the creation and premiere of seven new works, we are making a studio recording of the pieces, with album art by John Lee. You can see more of his work here.
 
Your support will make the following possible:- commissioning our composers and artists
- booking venues and producing publicity
- recording and releasing the studio album

<p>We would like to begin with some background on us to let you know who we are and what we can bring to you!</p>
<p>Belgian Producer, Sunfreakz is a classically trained musician with a focus on classical techniques, theory, harmony, composition and history. This focus led to his first success, “Inner Life” (Decoy &amp; Roy), where he created a sound that took him from his classical roots to modern-day trance. Followed by House hit record, “Riding The Wave”, and a number of remixes for artists like Flo Rida, Ne-Yo, Nelly Furtado, Sophia May and William Orbit. Other hit records include “Counting Down The Days” (featuring Andrea Britton) and “Drive Out”. Collaborations with American songwriter/recording artist, Jeremy Carr has led to their 2011 release, “The Way We Are”. He collaborated with New York City singer/songwriter, Whitney Tai in the winter of 2014 to release her first single, ""To Be Loved"" and her debut album, Metamorphosis shortly after.</p>
<p>Whitney Tai is an emerging singer, songwriter, entertainer and designer from New York City. In January 2014, Tai released her first pop single in collaboration with Sunfreakz, “To Be Loved,” and a remix by Adrian Buster shortly after. The song received Hot Shot of the week on two FM stations in the country of Holland gaining her recognition from DJ’s and producers worldwide. In April 2015, Whitney dropped her first debut pop alternative album, “Metamorphosis,” written and co­-produced with Billboard chart topping composer, Sunfreakz. Her newest EP of 2016, Forever, was produced by Billboard producer Spencer Garn, engineered by Morgan Ray Garcia of Upstairs Records (Toni Braxton, Whitney Houston, Janet Jackson) and features drums by Janelle Monae’s official drummer, Mikey Phillips. Catch her performing live throughout NYC throughout the fall of 2016 in some of Manhattans most exclusive venues.</p>
<p>The campaign set before you is to raise crucial funds to create a piece of film by a team who strives to bring only the best quality visuals to their audience. With a dance song meant to set the Fall of 2016 on fire with its deep lyrical meaning, Truth Be Told music video needs your help to allow for the tools that will let us achieve quality filming, props, stylists, makeup, lighting and final video production. We want you to share in the dream of making our vision come alive.</p>
</div><div>
<p>Truth Be Told is going to need 8,000 dollars in funding. We are striving to get close to this figure to cover costly items such as: Camera equipment, lighting equipment, special lenses, car rentals, room/space rentals, film assistants, travel fees, fashion stylists, makeup artists, hair stylists, editing/production, time and labor of all people involved.</p>
<p>Some awesome perks to those looking to help us make some magic:</p>
<p>For $25 dollars donated, the first 15 people will receive a special contributor thank you credit in the music video as a token of our appreciation.</p>
<p>For $100 dollars donated, you will receive a t-shirt or poster designed by Whitney Tai and Sunfreakz.</p>
<p>Any contributions above $100 will receive a surprise gift from the music team as a humble and grateful thanks for allowing our project to blossom.</p>
<p>Any funds left over from the music video will be planned to be put towards the hiring, recording and mixing of a professional string quartet for Whitney Tai's new Ballad (set to release Fall of 2016).</p>
</div><div>
<p>This project is valuable on a number of levels. Whitney Tai and Sunfreakz are determined to bring you a quality piece of film that will represent the 1,000's of indie artists stamping their place in the industry through hard work and determination. You would be offering us a chance to make something of intrinsic depth and meaning for those who value art, film and music.</p>
<p>We understand that some may not be able to donate, but we ask you to find out how you can contribute in your own way. Whether you simply lend us your time or share this campaign with as many people as possible, you are allowing us visibility and the chance to reach our goals.

<br/><h3>After handling entanglements, changing producers writing and rewriting songs, I have now returned bigger,sharpened, and stronger with new material that I truly believe in and want to share with you.</h3>
<div>With NO support of a label I have juggled trying to be a photographer, videographer, a regular employee, a artist and still deal with the everyday bills and stress of life. The good thing about not having a label though, I HAVE<strong> no limitations of a label.</strong> This allows me to invest in myself into the project more completely than a signed artist. I can work on my own terms, collaborate with the people I want to, track at the studios I want to and oversee artwork, manufacturing, promotion and every element of this album as it comes together. I can also help one of my favorite charities when its all said and done for ""The Life &amp; Times Of Eva Rhymes"" will have a percentage of all sales going to ""The House Of Ruth"", But that surely takes funds, and so far I am a one woman artist in a loosing battle. All my money is going to music and not my personal responsibilities causing problems that i must address urgently. But I don't want to lose time and you while i address my personal financial situation. </div>
<div>I feel fortunate to have the opportunity to create this album with you, the people (Weirdoz) that have supported Eva Rhymes (Jinxxx) through the years past and have inspired me to now continue on into the future. <br/>
</div>
<div>
<strong>Your pledges are going directly into the quality and reach of the album itself.</strong>They allow us the means to book time at studios we revere, travel to those locations, carefully record, mix and master the album in an effort to capture and articulate it in the best way that we can. This is an important album to us and we sincerely and passionately want to make the final outcome reflect that. Beyond that, your funding will allow us to manufacture physical copies so that we can continue to tour, distribute, promote, and spread the music to as many people as possible.  ‪This isn't a glamorous lifestyle and I don't plan on personally keeping any of the money raised - it is all going into making a really dope project and toward making this the best album that I with friends can create. ‬Like I also mentioned before just like anything I do I'd like to help a organization that i believe in and have volunteered at ""The House Of Ruth"" <br/>

When the album is completed Eva would like to give back to the community with a percentage of all sales going directly to the ""House Of Ruth"" as a donation to them and all their service to the community.

Your pledges are going directly into the quality and reach of the album itself.They allow us the means to book time at studios we revere, travel to those locations, carefully record, mix and master the album in an effort to capture and articulate it in the best way that we can. This is an important album to us and we sincerely and passionately want to make the final outcome reflect that. Beyond that, your funding will allow us to manufacture physical copies so that we can continue to tour, distribute, promote, and spread the music to as many people as possible.  ‪This isn't a glamorous lifestyle and I don't plan on personally keeping any of the money raised - it is all going into making a really dope project and toward making this the best album that I with friends can create. ‬Like I also mentioned before just like anything I do I'd like to help a organization that i believe in and have volunteered at ""The House Of Ruth"" 





How & Why I Want This Album To Help Domestic Violence Victims..
The organization ""House Of Ruth"" is a place Eva Rhymes has once volunteered and helped with donations to bring awareness in the past to the serious matter of Domestic Violence. In songs such as ""Jazebel"" and ""Young, Gifted and Black"" Eva sheds light on this topic for it will always be apart of her life, family and peers personal experiences. When the album is completed Eva would like to give back to the community with a percentage of all sales going directly to the ""House Of Ruth"" as a donation to them and all their service to the community. Each sale of the completed project Eva will take out 30% and donate by quarter to The House Of Ruth. This Is her pledge! Check out the alarming information about domestic violence below.


Every 9 seconds in the US, a woman is assaulted or beaten.12

On average, nearly 20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner in the United States. During one year, this equates to more than 10 million women and men.1

1 in 3 women and 1 in 4 men have been victims of [some form of] physical violence by an intimate partner within their lifetime.1

1 in 5 women and 1 in 7 men have been victims of severe physical violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime.1

1 in 7 women and 1 in 18 men have been stalked by an intimate partner during their lifetime to the point in which they felt very fearful or believed that they or someone close to them would be harmed or killed.1

On a typical day, there are more than 20,000 phone calls placed to domestic violence hotlines nationwide.9

is an hour long composition by Michael Pisaro, written for three
musicians playing live and pre-recorded piano, percussion, sine

music as composers and performers. We've had the privilege of
performing Concentric Rings in Magnetic Levitation several times in
The Netherlands, Israel and Germany, and we've found it to be a
challenging and enriching experience for both the performers and
audience. After our  performance in Berlin last September we decided
to record it for Martin's <a href=""https://dumpf.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dumpf Edition</a> label. The recording will
take place in Zürich, Switzerland on the 18th and 19th of August
2016 with experienced sound engineer and collaborator Willy Strehler,

<h3>These ""VOIDS""</h3>
<p>After 2 years, we are finally ready to share an all new collection of the best songs we've ever written. A lot of 'life' has happened for us, and these songs are presented as an anthology. Rather than focusing on a single moment or feeling, we've allowed time to explore our creative potential and treat each song as an artistic monolith.</p>
<p>On previous records, we've maintained a very closed circle. And while it's resulted in some amazing music (in our humble opinion), we felt it was time to increase our orbit. For this album, we recruited Travis Orbin of Darkest Hour (<a href=""http://travisorbin.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://travisorbin.com,</a> <a href=""http://officialdarkesthour.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://officialdarkesthour.com</a>) to provide acoustic drum / percussion tracks and the results are <a href=""https://www.reverbnation.com/barricadesatnight/song/26350637-envy-the-dead--pity-the-dying"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>amazing</i></a>.</p>
<p>We think of this record as a greatest hits collection for albums we've yet to complete. Pulling from past and present ideas and emotions, we were very critical of ourselves and maintained exceedingly high expectations to weed out weak and underdeveloped concepts. What we were left with are these 11 incredibly diverse tracks that share only a single common sonic and thematic element: space. It is with great pleasure that we present these VOIDS for your listening enjoyment...but we need your help.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For the first time in Barricades history, we are hoping to release this album on vinyl. We've specifically engineered this record to take full advantage of the dynamic range and quality offered by the vintage format, but production costs are much higher than modern digital and compact disc alternatives (which we will also be offering). With your support, we will be pressing to audiophile quality 180 gram vinyl in both traditional black and opaque white options with static reducing polyethylene sleeves. The album artwork will be presented in full color and in its intended 12"" x 12"" format on high quality matte stock, and we'll be including a double-sided insert with album lyrics.</p>
