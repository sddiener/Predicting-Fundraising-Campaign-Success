<h3>Bref résumé</h3>Ce projet vise à apporter l'indépendance alimentaire et énergétique partout dans le monde, là où le besoin est le plus urgent (en tant que Québécois, j'aimerais beaucoup commencer dans le Nord du Québec, où des peuples autochtones doivent commander leur nourriture par avion, et où l'insécurité alimentaire est courante). Il vise à éliminer notre dépendance face à l'État, à rendre l'austérité insignifiante et à faire de la pauvreté un concept du passé. À nous apporter l'indépendance nécessaire pour être un peuple libre. Libre de travail, libre d'énergies sales et de destruction de la nature dont nous faisons partie. Libre de vivre durablement et intelligemment, avec toutes les technologies qui sont à notre disposition mais qu'on tente de nous cacher.  Il vise à éliminer ces façons destructrices de faire les choses, non pas en les supprimant pour nous laisser dans le néant et l'incompréhension, mais plutôt en construisant des alternatives auxquelles nous pouvons adhérer. C'est un organisme public, qui n'appartient à personne et qui est toujours ouvert à d'autres projets à l'échelle internationale, avec comme principal but de libérer la planète et ses formes de vies de leur exploitation. Soit en démarrant des projets de: <br/><br/><ul>

<h3>Ce dont nous avons besoin et ce que vous obtenez</h3>
<ul>
<li>Le montant pour que le projet se réalise n'est pas clair, et n'a probablement pas de limite, puisqu'il vise à apporter un changement concret dans le monde entier. Il faudra d'abord que les peuples acceptent de recevoir l'aide de Free People (si ça n'arrive pas, l'indépendance alimentaire et énergétique sera tout simplement donnée ailleurs, aux occupations de l'Appel de l'Est, ou à tout autre groupe de militant-e-s qui souhaitent déclarer faire partie d'une terre exploitée, par exemple).<br/>
</li>
<li>Une partie des fonds servira à payer le billet d'avion pour se rendre aux endroits inaccessibles par la terre ferme. </li>
<li>Nous utiliserons le plus possible de matériaux recyclés, pour gérer les fonds le mieux possible et pour prouver que c'est possible de subvenir à nos besoins en travaillant la terre. (Par exemple, des pneus, du bois et des fenêtres pour faire un Earthship se trouvent facilement dans des dépotoirs. <br/>
</li>
<li>Une autre partie servira à financer de l'équipement audiovisuel pour propager le travail de Free People à l'échelle de la planète.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>L'impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>Ce projet possède ce qu'il faut pour nous sortir du système actuel, et à nous assurer que nos besoins de base seront comblés si jamais celui-ci s'écroule. </li>
<li>Il a le potentiel de nous montrer qu'il est possible de vivre sans argent, que d'autres façons de vivre sont possibles et qu'un retour aux sources nous permettrait de libérer la planète de cet esclavage corporatif. <br/>
</li>
<li>Il peut montrer la voie sur comment boycotter toutes les industries que nous souhaiterions voir disparaitre. <br/>
</li>
<li>J'ai déjà rejoint beaucoup de gens avec mes paroles et réalisé que tout le monde veut la même chose, mais personne ne sait comment s'y prendre. Ils attendent de se faire montrer comment faire. (Je l'ai vu suite aux réactions à ce vidéo que j'ai réalisé il y a quelques mois :  <a href=""https://consciencehumaniterre.wordpress.com/2015/03/13/visiteurs-nous-urgent-de-changer/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""https://consciencehumaniterre.wordpress.com/2015/03/13/visiteurs-nous-urgent-de-changer/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://consciencehumaniterre.wordpress.com/201...</a> ) La meilleure façon de convaincre les autres d'adhérer à d'autres façons de vivre n'est pas seulement d'en parler, mais d'y adhérer soi-même et de prouver que c'est possible. Nous n'avons pas besoin d'être une majorité, seulement d'être un assez grand nombre qui effectue ce virage au cœur même des villes et des villages qui existent déjà.</li>
<li>J'ai déjà expérimenté le fait d'investir de son temps et de travailler pour le bien-être et le bonheur des autres en faisant une épicerie gratuite, pendant environ 2 mois, presque à chaque jour à Montréal. Je m'installait à des endroits particuliers, soit au Parc Émilie-Gamelin, au Square Saint-Louis, où tout simplement près de l'endroit où j'habitais temporairement. Avec l'aide de quelques amis, nous avons aussi fait quelques repas du style Food Not Bombs, et nous mangions avec tous ceux qui passaient par là, en chantant et en parlant de solutions et d'entraide. J'ai réalisé que si je voulais voir plus d'entraide, d'unité et de collectivisme, je devais l'incarner. Ces moments, où certain-e-s ont pleuré de joie d'avoir quelqu'un qui les écoutait et qui prenait soin d'eux, humainement, et non pas en voyant ça comme un devoir forcé, ont été les plus beaux moments de ma vie. J'ai vraiment appris à me soucier du bonheur et du confort des autres avant même de penser au mien. De toute façons, celui-ci est devenu une condition pour le mien. Ubuntu : je suis parce-que nous sommes. Je fournissais également les occupations #OccupeToute des cégeps, principalement au cégep Saint-Laurent, mais aussi quelques fois au cégep du Vieux-Montréal et au cégep Maisonneuve. J'ai donc vraiment envie de pousser cette implication à un autre niveau.<br/>
</li>
<li>J'ai tenté de faire ce virage à l'OccupeToute du Cégep de Saint-Laurent (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/glune/videos/10206057507013206/?pnref=story"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/glune/videos/102060575...</a>), en les convainquant de continuer l'occupation pour l'été et de prouver que nous pouvions subvenir à nos besoins sans avoir accès au cégep pour l'eau, la douche et l'électricité. J'avais entrepris de construire une douche solaire (avec un gallon d'eau peinturé en noir au bouchon percé, et une toile fixée sur un hula-hoop, le tout reposant sur une structure en bois récupéré), un four solaire (avec une boîte et du papier d'aluminium), des récupérateurs d'eau de pluie (des toiles étirées au maximum, en forme d'entonnoir, avec un trou et un baril en dessous). Un grand jardin était déjà cultivé par certains élèves du cégep. Nous avions aussi récupéré beaucoup de pneus, ce qui me donnait envie d'entreprendre la construction d'un Earthship (je possède le DVD de Solutions Era qui explique comment s'y prendre). Seulement, il y a eu un manque d'intérêt, de motivation ou de compréhension de l'impact que pourrait avoir l'occupation, et celle-ci a pris fin, suite à un vote (je n'étais pas présent cette journée-là pour défendre mon point de vue ou tout simplement voter).<br/>

<h3>Risques et défis</h3>
<ul>
<li>Il se pourrait que certain-e-s tentent de profiter du financement que Free People recevra pour se payer des voyages gratuits. Il faudrait alors s'assurer que les intentions des participants sont bonnes et qu'ils emmèneront véritablement l'indépendance alimentaire et énergétique. Je ne sais pas comment y arriver, je laisse donc cette question ouverte. Tout ce que je sais, c'est que si ça arrive, ça prouverait que cette personne est égoïste à un plus haut point et aurait prouvé qu'elle n'a aucune humanité, et que le malheur des autres la laisse dans la plus grande indifférence. </li>
<li>Un autre défi sera de s'assurer que les spécialistes de l'agriculture ou de l'énergie ont vraiment les capacités qu'ils disent posséder. Il faudrait donc des preuves à l'appui.</li>
<li>Il se pourrait que certain-e-s se blessent. Il faudrait donc s'assurer de toujours avoir une trousse de premiers soins sur place. </li>
<li>Il est possible que l'État tente de défendre les terres qu'il dit posséder. Il faudra donc être conscients que nos projets peuvent être détruits. Si ça arrive, il faudra se fier sur la conscience de tous et toutes pour supporter nos actions et condamner celles de l'État, qui tenterait de nous forcer à revenir dans le système en train de sombrer dans le néant, ce qui serait une attaque contre l'humanité, ainsi que la charte des droits et libertés.</li>
<li>Il se peut que des pays dans le besoin soient en guerre. Il faudra donc prendre les précautions nécessaires pour assurer que les endroits visités soient sécuritaires.<br/>

The center / Le centre 





French Version
(English version above)

Qui sommes-nous?
Bonjour à tous, Nous sommes Yamin et Dounia, nous sommes actuellement volontaire dans une ONG canado-palestinienne, Project Hope à Naplouse, en Palestine. En tant que volontaire, nous enseignons le français et l'anglais dans différent programmes gérés par Project Hope dans tous Naplouse et dans les environs.  Nous sommes en Palestine depuis 1 mois maintenant et nous nous plaisons réellement ici, les gens sont parmi les plus chaleureux que nous avons eu la chance de rencontrer. Malgré les privations et l'occupation, ils sont prêts à tout partager avec vous même le peu qu'ils ont et cela en gardant toujours le sourire!



 


Le Camp de réfugiés de Balata & le centre Najer Aloja
Il y a plus de 20000 réfugiés recensés à Balata, ce qui en fait l'un des camps les plus densément peuplé en Cisjordanie.
Nous (tous les volontaires) enseignons différentes choses dans différents centres. Anglais, français, du théâtre et même de la zumba! Je peux vous assurer que ces enfants sont toujours enthousiastes et très excités à l'idée d'apprendre!  Notre travaillons bénévolement et les cours sont bien entendu gratuits pour les enfants. Le seul problème rencontré est l'état du centre Naher Aloja, la salle de classe est vide, il n'y a rien, pas de bureaux, ni de fournitures et même pas de fenêtres. Malgré cela, ils continuent de venir et de sourire!




 Pourquoi nous récoltons des fonds et pour en faire quoi? 

Comme vous pouvez le voir sur les photos, le centre est plutôt vide. Notre but ici est de l'équiper avec des fournitures de bases ( tableaux, bureaux, rafraîchir les murs, des feutres et papiers pour les enfants). 
Nous ne demandons pas beaucoup! Nous espérons récolter 500 euros pour ce projet. Ces enfants sont heureux avec un nouveau feutre, alors imaginez la joie que ce serait pour eux de pouvoir apprendre dans une vraie salle de classe digne de ce nom! 

Peinture et peintre : 120€
15 Bureau et Chaise 20€ x 15 = 300€
Tableau blanc 40€
Armoire avec cadenas 40€
Fourniture de base ( feuilles, cahiers, feutres …) 50€
Total =  550€

SI vous ne pouvez pas vous permettre de donner, partager simplement cette campagne avec vos amis, votre famille et collègues. Si jamais nous obtenons plus que demandé, l'argent sera reversé à des ONG locales ici en Naplouse et en Palestine qui œuvrent à l'éducation des enfants.

<h3>Take the Kids to the Sea</h3>
<p>I am Varisa Sinthusake, one of volunteers of this project. I used to work along Thai-Myanmar border and have continued my ideology to work close to migrants and refugees in social development organizations. Today, I am trying to raise fund for this year's project which will be held on 3-7 May, 2018 in the southern beach of Thailand.</p>
<p>Background of this project started when 30 volunteers went up on the mountain along Thai-Myanmar border in 2012 to help migrant/ and or refugee family and children built earthen school and learning centers. While we were learning about inequality, poverty and human rights problems, we also experience love and faith from innocent people who seek asylum and fled from places they used to call home. Most children would appear normal to other people. They helped us building their own school by that time. They were asked to sculpt the decoration on the earthen wall of each classroom. One of our volunteers walked around to see how they did and found the sculpture of the man pointing a gun to another man who already lied down on the ground. Our friend urgently took that sculpture out and replaced it with flower sculpture. What I am trying to tell the world is that these children might look like normal kids, but they were vulnerable inside. After that trip, we made strong bond with all these pure hearts people and would like to contribute something for them, and of course for us too.</p>
<p>""Take the kids to the sea"" project has started in 2012 with all helps only from friends and some people who know about this project. Our volunteer group take 7-15 year-old students from 4 schools in Umphang and Mae sot, Tak, Thailand to the eastern beach of Thailand. Each trip take them 16 hours in total traveling from the mountain high of west of Thailand to the beach located in the east of Thailand so that each kid can experience playing in the sea for the first time of their lives.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Where do donations go? </h3>
<p>1) Transportation cost (vehicle and fuel) for 40 children, 4 teachers and 2 drivers to travel round trip from the school and back to school after the trip.</p>
<p>2) Accommodation for 5 days and 4 nights in the camp. (This year, we plan to book the accommodation in Prachuabkirikhan province, south of Thailand)</p>
<p>3) Food and drinks for 40 children, 4 teachers and 2 drivers. Exclude volunteers.</p>
<p>4) Teachers and drivers stipends.</p>
<p>5) Equipment for activities in the camp.</p>
<p>6) After this project, all remaining donations will go to migrant learning centers in Umphang, Thailand</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>After 5 years of ""Take the Kids to the Sea"" project, we got to see all those happy faces. They got opportunities. But on the top of that, they get to see the world and realize that they have all those basic human rights equally as others. </p>

<p>For people with disabilities a job is more than just a paycheck.  A job means dignity and a sense of purpose, friendships and community.  Yet over 80% of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities are unemployed, despite research that shows that disabled people can often perform as well or better than their non-disabled counterparts. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559836192/qk4bygzj8okxr5aut34x.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>So my wife and I decided to build a coffee shop and design it to make jobs more accessible for people with disabilities.  As a special educator she knows that thousands of people are living lives of isolation needlessly, and as a consultant and business analyst I brought a knowledge of new technologies in food service to the table.  We selected a fantastic location in Burlington, Vermont and built the store ourselves to save money. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561052687/vgkwubfra41qq39ghgbi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>After just one month in business we received notification from the City that they were shutting down the street in front of our store for an additional 6 months to replace the storm water system and remove contaminated soils.  We knew about this project when we signed the lease and are excited about having a new, state of the art walkable and bikeable street.  We carefully planned our lease start to coincide with the street being reopened, and built a 30 day cushion in to our plans.  This sudden, unexpected and as of yet not adequately explained 6 month extension of the street closure has resulted in a 75% loss of business.  Projecting this loss out through the summer is unsustainable for our small business.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We purchased a state-of-the art coffee roaster to roast specialty coffee for our shop.  Our roaster is all electric and we offset the power consumption with 35 leased solar panels.  Our filtration system captures virtually all the smoke and odors so the particulates don't end up in the air.  Since it is so hard to get to our shop, we are bringing our roasted coffee to you. </p>
<ul>
<li>Our goal is to produce $25,000 in roasted coffee sales.  This income will be used to fulfill orders, pay wages, and help with operating expenses while the construction lasts.</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have always felt that if given a level playing field that people with disabilities can perform as well as or better than their non-disabled counterparts.  While we now know that our employees can compete with anyone, the playing field is not level.  A coffee shop must be easily accessible to the public in order to survive and the road closure has severely hindered that.  As it stands, our coffee shop will have to endure the first 250 days of its existence cut off from the community due to this unplanned extended road closure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our goal is to perfect a business model that will provide meaningful, competitively paid and inclusive employment to people with disabilities.</li>
<li>Once proven, this model can be rolled out in a variety of industries, providing hope and opportunities to many, their families and caregivers.</li>
<li>Jobs can foster dignity and respect, understanding and a sense of community. Our coffee shop provides opportunities to those that have none.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have already been notified of three road-project extensions.  There is no guarantee that we will not face another.  Should that happen we will continue to focus our energies on internet coffee sales and wholesale/retail coffee sales.</p>
<ul>
<li>We are currently roasting every day.  Our roaster is small with a 10 lb per hour capacity.</li>
<li>Should we be unable to keep up with demand, we will consider leasing a second roaster.</li>

Our Story

When we started @HiddenCash, it was with the intention of giving back to the community, in a fun way. It was never meant to be an act of charity. As we made clear from the beginning, we also do give to various charities when the opportunity arises and we are able to. Nevertheless, a frequent criticism we heard was ""why don't you give to those who really need it?"". Well, we always did, but now we want to do it with you. 


For the first time ever since we started @Hiddencash, we are asking YOU, our followers, to join us this holiday season. We want to do this together, to raise money and awareness to feed the hungry. Millions of people right here in the richest country in the world go hungry. Families, fathers, mothers, and - worst of all - helpless children. 



Your Impact: 


For every $1 donated, the Feeding America network of food banks will secure and distribute 10 meals to people facing hunger.   

Perks: 
In addition to helping feed people in hunger, your contribution can get you some fun perks - including a replica of our Fox mascot (cash gifted to Feeding America)!  



(Have a perk you'd like for us to offer? Let us know what and the amount in the comments) 

Why Feeding America? 
Inspired by one of our role models, Tony Robbins (TEDTalk), who has been involved with Feeding America for many years, we started a campaign to raise money to help this wonderful organization feed thousands of families across America. We are asking for your help, and have some cool rewards for those who help. But giving is its own reward. Do you know that researchers discovered that giving makes people happier than anything else they can do with their money? We can personally testify to that, as Hiddencash and other less celebrated projects we have done have personally shown us.  #TheSecretToLivingIsGiving

During this holiday season, we ask that you please help us feed those who need it most. Whether or not you contribute, please join us in sharing the campaign with your friends and family. Together, we can create a better world.

fear of the horror they have survived and with even higher anticipation of what
is waiting for them, they start their journey to the Western European
countries. One common refugee’s route is crossing through our neighboring
countries – Serbia and Croatia. The terrors of war that we have experienced in the Balkans during
the nineties are now what the citizens of Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq are going
through in the past few years. The road to a safer life is often burdened with bureaucracy,

<p>Let’s be honest, no one wants their kids seeing porn or stuff that might upset them but David Cameron’s suggestion of, ""one click to protect your whole home and keep your children safe"" is deeply irresponsible.

<h4><b>Hello, My name is Dennis King. </b></h4>     I am undertaking this project because a friend of mine was a homeless veteran. His name was Dwight. I did everything I could to help get him off the streets. I took him to drug rehab centers, had him stay at my place whenever I could get him to agree to stay. I made sure he had a job with my construction business. I even took him to the Veterans Affairs Hospital on many occasions for treatment of the ailments of which he was afflicted. Dwight had post traumatic stress disorder among other ailments. I tried to help him get all of the benefits that were rightfully his. It was very difficult watching a friend deteriorate right before my eyes.<br/> <p>     On a Friday evening after I had paid him for the work he did that week, we sat in my van and had a very honest conversation. Dwight told me he appreciated everything I had done for him. He said I was the only one in his life who really cared what happened to him. He said that because of all of the things I had done for him that he was gaining the confidence to do more for himself. I told him I was glad to hear him say that and offered to let him stay at my place that night. He declined and asked me to drop him off at one of his regular spots. He got out of the van and I told him I would pick him up the next morning. He said OK, I'll see you then.<br/><br/>     The next morning as I approached the location where I was to pick him up for  work that day I noticed several police cars were in the area. I parked my van, got out and approached one of the officers. I asked the officer what had happened. I told him I was there to pick up one of my workers. He took the opportunity to ask me if I knew the victim. I said yes and asked what happened. He said the victim was dead and that he needed for me to give a statement and to help contact Dwight's next of kin.</p>
<p>      I later learned from the medical examiners office that he died from blunt force trauma to the head.</p>
<p>Many times I have asked myself if Dwight had had a place of his own, would things have turned out differently that night?</p>

<p>     Simply having affordable housing will help alleviate the primary causes of homelessness among veterans which are:</p>

<p>3. Combat-related mental health issues and disabilities.</p>

<h3>The Situation</h3>
<p>Our life-long friend Bettie needs our help as she begins fighting to relocate from Colorado back home to Texas with her twins.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Maybe like a lot of you, I can't stand to hear stories of domestic violence and abuse. When I had first heard about the years of abuse she endured, I thought it sounded like a movie on the Lifetime channel it was so horrific! Though she was finally able to get away from her abuser with the help of Victim's Advocates, she is now in the beginnings of a legal battle with him and the state, just to be able to leave his town and move back home with her children.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We've known Bettie for over 30 years, and she is without a doubt the kindest, friendliest, most empathetic and giving person I know! She would do most anything for anyone, but is the last person in the world to ask for help. She is very dear to me, and that's why I have decided to <strong>quietly</strong> raise some much needed funds for her and the kids. Now it's our turn to help HER as she fights to gain the freedom to come home to her friends and family who love her so much!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Bottom Line</h3>
Long story short, she needs help with legal fees, moving expenses and interim living expenses. Like anything else, the court will have the final decision. But without resources to fight, the book is already closed. <strong>So, please join me and let's help Bettie win this fight and be an example to other survivors of domestic violence that the cycle of abuse CAN be broken!</strong>

With that in mind, sharing privately will keep the cat in the bag and off her wall and make it that much more special! Thanks again everyone, let's do this! :)",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

I just wanted to say that it would be nice if this was also in Montreal, [and that we] have some of the hearings in Montreal, since approximately %80 of the English speaking community in Quebec is based around Montreal.<a href=""#_edn1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title="""">[i]</a> <br/><br/>I am the volunteer Spokesperson for the non-profit organisation Quebec Office of the English Language (l’Office québécois de la langue anglaise - OQLA.org nous avons autour de 6 milles membres). It is time for our organisations, several organisations, and sister groups (CRITIQ – Canadian Rights in QC [speaking tomorrow], Unity Group here with me right now, PutBackTheFlag.com – thankfully its [Canadian flag] is still there), and MNAs (thanks to the [QC] Liberals here for saying a clear NO to Bill 14 already) begin to voice their support for the ‘other’ Official Language in Quebec, <strong>English. Why? Since most, the majority of Quebeckers want to move on from the separatist agenda and re-enforce their ties with the rest of Canada: a good start would be embracing the English language</strong>.</p>
<p>Firstly, and most importantly, we believe that the, <strong>English be returned to a fully Official Language status </strong>in QC to respect the constitution and our shared history. We strongly believe that the trend, as set out in the proposed Bill 14, needs reversal in order to give the 80 plus English Speaking communities across Quebec respite from the constant and methodological reduction of services. <br/><br/>It takes an ignorant person refer to English as a ‘Foreign’ language in Quebec. Furthermore, refusing Institutionalised Bilingualism is the same as prevention of advancement of our community, and is a key factor of the tyrannical Linguicisim in Quebec. <em>Et je parle de quelqu’un qui est bilingue, de Vancouver, et je suis outré de ce qui se passe au Québec !</em><br/><br/>Bill 14 wishes to legislate ‘identity’, yet another unwanted ‘clause’ that would hang over on our community, and further reason to legitimise <strong>discrimination based on language</strong>. Predominance we had before [Bill 22], Bill 101 said we were non-official speakers in our own province, now you want to legitimise [legislate] ‘identity’!?), hitherto additional reasoning to make non-francophones feel that they are second class in their home and native province. Furthermore, <strong>playing identity politics is irresponsible</strong>, and I do not believe you are sincerely responsible Madame le Ministre [Diane de Courcy], but it is par for the course with ethno-nationalists here in Quebec, who think they have replaced the First Nations, who primarily use English (Mohawks, Cree, Hurons, [Innu]…), who speak amongst each other, who live double [the] discrimination. This is why Aboriginals have been very offended with the linguistic segregation proposed by this PQ Bill, these policies and rhetoric, this has been going on since last summer.  Legislating the QC Identity as FR-only, over-writing the true history of Quebec in Canada, would be a violation of the Human Rights Charter in itself: Section 10, language as a prohibited grounds of discrimination, which leads me to my next point. <br/><br/>It would seem there is little respect for the Universality of Human Rights in this province, since again, Bill 14 wishes to amend our Quebec Human Rights Charter, to simply do away with Ethnic Communities (ce n’est pas simplement une question de semantiques) and turn them into indefensible, e.g. from the standpoint of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Hague, changing them to ‘cultural communities’ would have this effect. Il semble que les consequences de cette loi ne sont pas reconnues. Several Barristers (including Colin Standish, here from Université Laval, Brent Tyler was here before) have come forward to contribute to the Montreal Gazette denouncing this attempt, yet another, to legislate away the rights of minorities.</p>
<p>If anything should be done regarding related legislation (Bill 101, 22, 178…whatever, the list goes on), it is time to consider these four simple concessions to the non-Francophone community that make up around 20% of the population and pay approximately 40% of taxes - believe it or not. It was René-Lévesque who said to us; he’s standing [right] out there [of the assembly], his statue standing right out there, that if you pay taxes, you are Quebecker. We certainly do not feel that way, and Bill 14 will continue to make us feel as ‘foreigners’ in our own province, since it is against the other Official Language of our country, <strong>Canada</strong>! <strong>Quebec is not a country</strong>. <strong><em>Le but, il semble, est de se débarrasser des Anglophones avec ce projet de loi, et les droits de la majorité en même temps. Le droit de la majorité d’apprendre l’anglais comme il faut, pour réussir en affaires, pour réussir avec le monde [en] entier. </em></strong><br/><br/>There is a <strong>great opportunity</strong> to bring balance back and respect of the <strong>Rule of Law in QC</strong>. Now that the Charbonneau commission has made a clean sweep of corruption, we need a similar commission to examine existing discriminatory legislation. As such, a ‘stronger Bill 101’ is completely and totally inappropriate.  As the Suburban’s Editor, Beryl Wajsman, has stated – <strong>Bill 14: Don’t Even Think About It!</strong> Instead, Bill 101 should be replaced with Bill 199, as submitted by Neill Cameron, in the early nineties. <br/><br/>If Britain and France had an <strong><em>Entente Cordiale</em></strong>, <strong><em>il y a un siècle</em></strong> a hundred years ago England and France had an Entente Cordiale, <strong>why not here in Quebec</strong>? We are all neighbours, we live next to each other – <em>mon ami Bertrand en face de moi, et mes autres amis francophones [ils se rendre compte que]</em> we do not need a logistic [logical] division anymore! [<em>There is no physical Manche between us, I was supposed to say</em>] This Legal divide has been placed between us by opportunistic politicians, inebriated nationalists, separatist militants (caribous), <em>et al.</em></p>
<p>Secondly, we need increased access to our bilingual English public schools (starting with the EMSB and LBPSB immediately, who have been short of ‘oxygen’ for years) – some 10,000 non-eligible children per year.  Immigrants, especially those from English-speaking jurisdictions outside of Canada, should have the <strong>full freedom of choice in public schools</strong> to respect U.N. Conventions that existing provincial legislation currently flouts, and would <strong>only worsen with Bill 14</strong> regarding CEGEP access, and openly disrespect Military Families. We would accept, as a proper management decision made by the Quebec Government that has its ENTIRE population’s interests considered, at an absolute minimum that a proportional percentage of immigrants (approx. 20%) are allowed into the English School System. A system, I might add, which produces a qualified majority of bilingual Quebeckers, as Angela Mancini recently made clear, thus indirectly contributing to linguistic majority.</p>
<p>The <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">third</span> community need is <strong>guaranteed bilingual medical services</strong>. Considering the Federal Government provides the QC Provincial treasury with special allocations for our community, why is this currently an issue? Given the systemic corruption identified by the Charbonneau Commission and ‘<em>le nivellement vers le bas</em>’, one can only speculate why we think that our Heath services are not negotiable. Nobody should have to pass a language test to ‘qualify’ for medical services! Mark S. Bergeron’s <a href=""http://www.globalmontreal.com/quebec+ambulance+agency+defends+paramedic/6442739911/story.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">incident with an Ambulance technician</a> during Autumn past was horrifying - he has since stepped forward to denounce the situation we are in, and is current Leader of the Equality Party 2.0! It should be noted that in Ontario, the French Language Services Act recently celebrated 25 years of existence. Why does our minority in QC, almost double the size, not have the equivalent agreement? Why do francophones from outside of Quebec, namely Sentators Maria Chaput and Andrée Champagne, in their report from 2010, recommend that monies go directly to our institutions?</p>
<p>Our <span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">fourth demand</span>, and last request, is <strong>to dismiss any threshold to have bilingual municipalities revoked. Alternatively, leave it entirely in the hands of the municipality, without OQLF harassment and respect for localised democracy. </strong> This would stop this PQ-imposed threshold that is unrealistic for the survival of our communities, despite peaceful EN &amp; FR speaking neighbourhoods thriving as part of the inter-woven multi-cultural (and not unicultural, unilingual) fabric over hundreds of years - even after two conquests (Kirke, Wolfe) and two lost referendums.  There are countless examples of street, parks and monuments are renamed <strong>without</strong> public involvement and are repetitive attempts to <strong>outlaw the use of English</strong> by any means possible. <em>En sommaire</em>, <em>il faut la préservation de la richesse de notre province, quoi que ce soit, au niveau de côté linguistique, de l’histoire.  Au Qu</em><em>é</em><em>bec cela ne se passe pas uniquement et seulement en fran</em><em>çais !</em></p>
<p>In expectation of good faith, this will involve changes to Bill 101 as opposed to Bill 14, although we suggest the former be replaced with former MNA for Jacques-Cartier, Neil Cameron’s Bill 199, <a href=""https://docs.google.com/a/intellabase.com/document/pub?id=1goluXHibC2KSEBXxXTC5U7EuliUbjlg1QHh4PjguBmA"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Charter of the French <strong>and</strong> English Languages</a>. It would resolve much of the linguistic tension by declaring both languages equal since <strong>French in our province is not threatened</strong> with well past 7M people speaking it. <br/><br/>Furthermore, this would respect the constitution of our great country by promoting the use of English <strong><em>also</em></strong> to save Quebec from this poor, bankrupt, and isolated province it has increasingly become over the past generation, and to remedy the colossal negative interdependence with the rest of Canada. <br/><br/>We hope to have the Liberal + CAQ MNAs agree to concede these four principles so that Minority Communities reassured publicly that their interests be recognised in eventual legislative change. Only, in this way, can the economy profit from being <strong>open to the <em>Lingua Franca</em> of the business world</strong>. <br/><br/>Yours sincerely, Veuillez accepter mes meilleures sentiments distinguées.</p>

I have joined with a nonprofit called The Exodus Road (a registered 501c3) that works with investigators in SE Asia and India. Working with local police, these investigative teams find and gather the evidence necessary for police to conduct rescues and raids. To date, The Exodus Road has supported the rescue of 253 victims of sex trafficking.I have been on the ground for almost two months, working in dangerous boarder town brothels and bars. I have personally been involved in may survellence cases, sting operations and rescues. The work is often very hard mentally and emotionally as well as physically. I have had to put to use all my training from the military and law enforcement.  I am currently working with a team in SE Asia that already has solid police contacts and have been active in undercover investigations for several years. Currently the team is working on 40 active cases--including everything from pedophilia, minors sold for sex, restricted movement and trafficking across borders.I do not recieve a salary. All I need is the funding to do the work. I'd be honored if you would consider joining me in going into the darkness for the sake of the child and the oppressed. What We Need & What You GetBecause I am working with a nonprofit that seeks to maximize donated funds for raids/rescues/investigative expenses, I am needing to raise my own funding to do this work for six months. I am asking my friends and family and community to pitch in and help me do this work. Here's what I need:I live off of ten US dollars a day or 300 dollars a month. That goes towards food, lodging and other expneses. I have raised a large portion already, but I am still short. I am asking 100 friends if they would consider donating 20 dollars each.  You can find out more about the organization by visiting the website here:www.theExodusRoad.com.

From 1995-1998, Mr. Johnson’s superior skills, persistence, and attitude led him to be a weapons instructor (specifically, pistol training) at the United States Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia, during which time he instructed approximately 3000 marines in how to protect themselves, their fellow soldiers, and their country.<br/>                In 1998, following his service as an instructor at Quantico, Mr. Johnson moved to Atlanta where he soon met the love of his life, Melissa.  In 2004, Wes and Melissa were blessed with a beautiful daughter.  In 2006, Wes and Melissa were blessed with a son.  Both of their children have proven excellent students and have remained at the top of their respective classes since kindergarten.  To this day, Wes and Melissa remain happy and devoted parents to their children, and the possibility of Wes losing time from his children’s lives is the major factor leading to this fundraising campaign.  <br/>                During his time in the Marines, Wes began experiencing a severe cough later diagnosed as tuberculosis and several other medical issues that would not ultimately be diagnosed for years to come, including a congenital defect of a rotated right hip which contributed to and exacerbated several back ailments he now experiences and genetic fatty cysts which have invaded his body.  In years that have followed, Wes has been diagnosed with arthritis, gout and a blot clot that ran the entire length of his right leg that nearly left him dead  from two pulmonary embolisms. To this day, he has a filter near his heart designed to catch clots and suffers from excessive fatigue.  Wes was, and still is, in constant, severe pain, and has difficulty sleeping, walking, and moving in general, and was instructed by his physician to quit his chosen profession as a chef.  These symptoms often prevent Wes from working (as a car salesman, chef, and an organic gardener, providing local restaurants and farmer’s markets with herbicide-free and pesticide-free watermelon, tomatoes, squash, okra, peppers, blueberries, cucumbers and lettuces) and enjoying his hobbies (walking, cooking, gardening and ice skating with his children).  <br/>               Mr. Johnson has been an ardent supporter of medical marijuana legalization since 2000.  Mr. Johnson co-founded rescheduleme.org, and industrialhemp4vicotry.org, two organizations dedicated to having cannabis rescheduled from the Schedule 1 category.  The Schedule 1 category is for drugs with a high potential for abuse, that have no currently accepted medical use in the United States, and for which there is a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision. In addition to being a supporter of medical marijuana, Mr. Johnson is a regular supporter  and advocate of St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital, The Salvation Army, The Girl Scouts of America, Goodwill, the Foundation for Free Flight and the Wounded Warrior Fund.<br/>Legal Defense:               <br/>	On June 2, 2015, officers from the Sandy Springs Police Department entered Mr. Johnson’s residence and allegedly found marijuana. Perhaps it’s a strange coincidence he became a target shortly after he ramped up his advocacy efforts, perhaps not.  After allegedly finding marijuana, he was charged with manufacturing and possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, trafficking of marijuana, and firearm possession during the commission of a felony. <br/>              Mr. Johnson is a patriotic American who loves his family, his community, and his country.  Mr. Johnson has become the poster child for what is wrong with America’s failed “War on Drugs.”  With Colorado, Washington, Alaska, Oregon, and even Washington D.C. fully legalizing marijuana, and 19 other states (including Georgia!) with some form of medical marijuana legalized, the prosecution and possible imprisonment of Mr. Johnson reflect the inherent unfairness of the charges brought against him. His children run the risk of losing their father during their formative years, and witnessing their mother, whose health is deteriorating due to Lupus, struggle to provide for them.<br/>              It will cost Mr. Johnson ten thousand dollars just to get through the pre-trial phase of his legal battle.  Mr. Johnson is requesting financial help from his friends, family and anyone else who feels he is being wrongfully prosecuted to assist him in paying his legal bills.  All of the money raised from this campaign will go directly to his legal defense bills.  Please help Wes fight for his freedom and his family.</p></div>","Wesley (“Wes”) Johnson, a family man and former Marine who was recently arrested because of antiquated laws regarding alleged growth and distribution of marijuana, is kindly  asking for financial assistance from friends, family, and the general public to help him win his fight against the inherently unfair and overzealous charges brought against him by the Sandy Springs Police Department.Who Wes is:                	Wes was born in Tennessee and, after graduating from high school, joined the United States Marine Corp because of his belief that we must ensure the rights and freedoms that our forefathers fought and died for.  From 1995-1998, Mr. Johnson’s superior skills, persistence, and attitude led him to be a weapons instructor (specifically, pistol training) at the United States Marine Corps Base in Quantico, Virginia, during which time he instructed approximately 3000 marines in how to protect themselves, their fellow soldiers, and their country.                In 1998, following his service as an instructor at Quantico, Mr. Johnson moved to Atlanta where he soon met the love of his life, Melissa.  In 2004, Wes and Melissa were blessed with a beautiful daughter.  In 2006, Wes and Melissa were blessed with a son.  Both of their children have proven excellent students and have remained at the top of their respective classes since kindergarten.

<p>The long and illustrious history of the Second Battalion, Fourth Marines began in April of 1914 during WWI when it was activated as one of the three battalions of the Fourth Marine Regiment.  The Marine infantry battalion earned the nickname, “The Magnificent Bastards” during Vietnam.</p>
<p>In February 2004, “The Magnificent Bastards” deployed to Ramadi, Iraq, the provincial capital of the Al Anbar Province, in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The Battle of Ramadi was pivotal for coalition operations in the Al-Anbar province. 2/4, along with the 1st BDE, 1st ID engaged insurgent forces in Ramadi in early April 2004.</p>
<p>The battle began at midmorning when Marine patrols fanned out across Ramadi to provide security and search for roadside bombs. Three squads from Third Platoon, Golf Company, 2nd Battalion 4th Marines set off on separate routes. They worked their way west from a Combat Outpost to the government center, 2 miles away, where they would link-up and stand guard.</p>
<p>During this movement a squad was ambushed and the adjacent squads came under fire while attempting to rescue the ambushed squad. Insurgents armed with small-arms and RPGs continued to battle the Marines for nearly 2-hours before the Marines could be effectively reinforced. It was one of the deadliest days of the war, but the Magnificent Bastards showed the insurgents that they were a far superior fighting unit.</p>
<p>Marines and Army soldiers killed an estimated 250 rebels from April 6 to April 10 in fighting that shattered the insurgent offensive. 13 Marines were killed and 25 were wounded in the battle on April 6. Another 4 were killed over the next four days. The battalion conducted support and stability operations (SASO) within the city and served with distinction while engaging insurgent forces in Iraq. 2/4 returned to Camp Pendleton in September 2004.</p>

<h3>It's Working!</h3>
<p>Thanks to our supporters, we hired our very first part-time staff. We have more brilliant and dedicated women volunteering than ever before. We got our first small grant from Spirit Mountain Community Fund, with more potential grants in the works. We created and implemented self-defense pilot program for high school students. We've created training opportunities for women from coast to coast. Best of all, in 2017 we provided over 100 empowerment-based women's and youth defense trainings in 13 cities. Only halfway through 2018, we have <i>already</i> provided 102 trainings in 10 cities.

</div><div>
<h3>These Trainings Change Lives.</h3>
<p>Our all-volunteer staff have provided thousands of women with free self-defense training, while helping women across the country bring empowerment-based self-defense to their communities. Our vision is unique. Unlike most self-defense programs, our services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always prioritize FREE training to women in need</li>
<li>Provide training in verbal boundary-setting and de-escalation skills - not just physical skills</li>
<li>Prioritize serving survivors of trauma</li>
<li>Address issues that women actually face, including verbal coercion, harassment, and emotional abuse</li>
<li>Empower women to bring self-defense training to other women in their own communities</li>
</ul>
<p>Supporters like you have made it possible for us to expand across the United States from our flagship chapter. As of this year, we also have ongoing training available in Tulsa and NYC. We regularly have anywhere from 50-300 women attempting to sign up for each training we schedule. The demand is huge, and we need your help to meet it!</p>
<p>Donate to support us during this crucial time of growth, and let us send you a gift as thanks. The perks for donating to this campaign are unique designs created by volunteers. Your support goes directly to providing self-defense training to women, and to making sure we can continue to live up to our mission.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Hard Parts.</h3>
<p>This is the most ambitious fundraising goal we've ever set, and it's because our program goals are more ambitious than ever before. It costs anywhere from $150-$500 to put on a training, depending on factors like space rental, travel costs, accommodations for participants, and more. Since the vast majority of our trainings are free, our supporters are absolutely necessary to making this work. More than just being able to put on trainings, we need to make sure that our trainings are accessible and relevant to women beyond just those with means and privileges. Your support helps us ensure that we provide needed services to rural women, teens and youth, those with physical limitations, survivors of trauma, women experiencing poverty, and more. This training changes lives, and our team is confident that we can meet these challenges with your help.</p>

Thanks to our supporters, we hired our very first part-time staff. We have more brilliant and dedicated women volunteering than ever before. We got our first small grant from Spirit Mountain Community Fund, with more potential grants in the works. We created and implemented self-defense pilot program for high school students. We've created training opportunities for women from coast to coast. Best of all, in 2017 we provided over 100 empowerment-based women's and youth defense trainings in 13 cities. Only halfway through 2018, we have already provided 102 trainings in 10 cities.

<li>The Nour Center is a school for over 200 Palestinian and Syrian youth located in the Burj Al-Barajneh refugee camp in Lebanon. The center is currently in urgent need of funds in order to cover its rent, utility costs, and teacher salaries. </li>
<li>If just 200 people donated $1/week, it would completely cover the expenses of the center, for a whole year! </li>
<li>It costs $330 a year to fund a students education at the Nour Center. </li>
<li>We are a group of college students studying across the world who believe in supporting the Nour Center.</li>
</ul><h3><strong>Social/Political Context</strong></h3><ul>
<li>Lebanon has been an escape for Syrian and Palestinian refugees for many years now. Over 1.1 million Syrian refugees and around 450,000 Palestinian refugees currently live across the country, many of them in one of twelve different refugee camps which often suffer from overcrowding and lack of proper healthcare, education, and security.</li>
<li>Both Syrian and Palestinian refugees struggle with obtaining jobs in Lebanon due to systematic discrimination against them, as they are often not granted legal working status even after legally settling in the country. <u>Most recently,</u> a law was passed that completely inhibits Syrians and Palestinians without work permits from working, which has sparked public outcry from the refugee communities around the country, as this hasn’t been the case since 1948. </li>
</ul><p>Children in the camps are, therefore, often left with little opportunity in terms of education and personal development. Young boys are commonly raised by street life, which usually leads to them joining local militias and engaging in drug/substance use. Young girls are often married at a very young age-- within their early teens many times-- often raising one or more children by the time they are 20 years old. </p><ul><li>
<u><strong>Burj Al-Barajneh Camp:</strong></u>  “[Burj Al-Barajneh] is the most overpopulated refugee camps around Beirut and living conditions are very poor.”-UNRWA Official Report on Burj al Barajneh Refugee Camp.</li></ul><p>The camp is located on the outskirts of Beirut, and it currently houses over 50,000 Palestinian and Syrian refugees combined. This is up from an original count of 26,000 before 2011--when the Syrian civil war began and Lebanon experienced an influx of refugees. The camp is known for its unsafe conditions and overcrowding. It suffers from sewage and drainage issues, contains low hanging frayed electrical wires, and is filled with tight, dark, and unclean streets.</p><h3><strong>What is the Nour Center? </strong></h3><ul>
<li>The Nour Center is a informal school for just over 200 Syrian and Palestinian children in the Burj Al-Barajneh refugee camp. The center was founded in 2011 after the beginning of the Syrian Civil war. The center is an informal school for these children as they <u>cannot attend normal public schools or UNRWA funded schools because they have not been granted legal refugee status in Lebanon.</u> Amidst the struggles experienced by both Syrians and Palestinians alike in the camp (and other camps), the WPA and its workers have successfully created a safe haven where both youth and young adults can recognize and achieve their full potential.</li>
<li>The center provides education to both Palestinians and Syrians from the ages of 6 to 18 years old (there are young adults from the ages of 18 to 24 also at the school, but they are funded by Anera)*. It provides education and support for just over 200 kids currently, and it only has four active teachers running the classes. Different subjects, including Arabic, English, and Math, are taught by the same teacher in the same classroom from 9 am to 1 pm. The students often arrive early and try their best to stay late at the center or at the WPA building located near the school as it is a place of true peace, calm, and joy.</li>
</ul><h3><strong>How/Why is it struggling?</strong></h3><ul>
<li>The center struggles greatly as it primarily helps children that do not have UN-recognized refugee status, and therefore cannot enter into UNRWA, United Nations Relief and Works Agency, schools. Furthermore, due to recent UNRWA budget cuts, there have been increasingly fewer children allowed to enter UNRWA schools which has added to the pressure on the Nour Center. <strong>The primary issue</strong> with the Nour Center is that it lacks any real form of <strong>long term security</strong>. The school is funded almost entirely by donations from individuals (although it has recently been lightly supported by ""Anera"" and ""Kafa"", two NGO’s linked below!), and over the past year, there has been a drastic decline in funds, putting the school in immediate risk of shutting down. The school’s yearly total costs are <strong>$70,000</strong>
</li>
<li>The center is currently behind on its rent payments due to scarce funds and is therefore at risk of shutting down before the <strong>beginning of 2020. </strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Furthermore, </strong>due to recent UNRWA budget cuts, many schools have been decreasing the amount of students they can support which is greatly increasing the demand for help from the center. </li>
</ul><p> </p><h3><strong>How you can help and where your money is going!!!</strong></h3><ul>
<li>
<strong>HOW?</strong> Any amount of donation is extremely helpful.  </li>

<br/><br/> </h3></div>","Summary
The Nour Center is a school for over 200 Palestinian and Syrian youth located in the Burj Al-Barajneh refugee camp in Lebanon. The center is currently in urgent need of funds in order to cover its rent, utility costs, and teacher salaries. 
If just 200 people donated $1/week, it would completely cover the expenses of the center, for a whole year! 
It costs $330 a year to fund a students education at the Nour Center. 
We are a group of college students studying across the world who believe in supporting the Nour Center.
Social/Political Context
Lebanon has been an escape for Syrian and Palestinian refugees for many years now. Over 1.1 million Syrian refugees and around 450,000 Palestinian refugees currently live across the country, many of them in one of twelve different refugee camps which often suffer from overcrowding and lack of proper healthcare, education, and security.
Both Syrian and Palestinian refugees struggle with obtaining jobs in Lebanon due to systematic discrimination against them, as they are often not granted legal working status even after legally settling in the country. Most recently, a law was passed that completely inhibits Syrians and Palestinians without work permits from working, which has sparked public outcry from the refugee communities around the country, as this hasn’t been the case since 1948. 
Children in the camps are, therefore, often left with little opportunity in terms of education and personal development. Young boys are commonly raised by street life, which usually leads to them joining local militias and engaging in drug/substance use. Young girls are often married at a very young age-- within their early teens many times-- often raising one or more children by the time they are 20 years old. 
Burj Al-Barajneh Camp:  “[Burj Al-Barajneh] is the most overpopulated refugee camps around Beirut and living conditions are very poor.”-UNRWA Official Report on Burj al Barajneh Refugee Camp.The camp is located on the outskirts of Beirut, and it currently houses over 50,000 Palestinian and Syrian refugees combined. This is up from an original count of 26,000 before 2011--when the Syrian civil war began and Lebanon experienced an influx of refugees. The camp is known for its unsafe conditions and overcrowding. It suffers from sewage and drainage issues, contains low hanging frayed electrical wires, and is filled with tight, dark, and unclean streets.What is the Nour Center? 
The Nour Center is a informal school for just over 200 Syrian and Palestinian children in the Burj Al-Barajneh refugee camp. The center was founded in 2011 after the beginning of the Syrian Civil war. The center is an informal school for these children as they cannot attend normal public schools or UNRWA funded schools because they have not been granted legal refugee status in Lebanon. Amidst the struggles experienced by both Syrians and Palestinians alike in the camp (and other camps), the WPA and its workers have successfully created a safe haven where both youth and young adults can recognize and achieve their full potential.
The center provides education to both Palestinians and Syrians from the ages of 6 to 18 years old (there are young adults from the ages of 18 to 24 also at the school, but they are funded by Anera)*. It provides education and support for just over 200 kids currently, and it only has four active teachers running the classes. Different subjects, including Arabic, English, and Math, are taught by the same teacher in the same classroom from 9 am to 1 pm. The students often arrive early and try their best to stay late at the center or at the WPA building located near the school as it is a place of true peace, calm, and joy.
How/Why is it struggling?
The center struggles greatly as it primarily helps children that do not have UN-recognized refugee status, and therefore cannot enter into UNRWA, United Nations Relief and Works Agency, schools. Furthermore, due to recent UNRWA budget cuts, there have been increasingly fewer children allowed to enter UNRWA schools which has added to the pressure on the Nour Center. The primary issue with the Nour Center is that it lacks any real form of long term security. The school is funded almost entirely by donations from individuals (although it has recently been lightly supported by ""Anera"" and ""Kafa"", two NGO’s linked below!), and over the past year, there has been a drastic decline in funds, putting the school in immediate risk of shutting down. The school’s yearly total costs are $70,000

The center is currently behind on its rent payments due to scarce funds and is therefore at risk of shutting down before the beginning of 2020. 


Furthermore, due to recent UNRWA budget cuts, many schools have been decreasing the amount of students they can support which is greatly increasing the demand for help from the center.

<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>
<b>We seek to raise $4,150.00</b>, which will cover the base cost of materials for the Labyrinth, such as the gravel for leveling, the labyrinth weed barrier/template  (biodegradable), brick for path outlines (reclaimed), smooth ""river rock"" for the paths (sourced locally), and the plaque (centerpiece). </div>
<div>Labyrinth planning, design, sales tax, and ongoing maintenance are all being covered at my personal expense (Lucas). </div>
<div>I am also personally covering any additional labor effort/costs beyond the workshop(June/August 2016) attendees who volunteer. </div>
<div>
<b>We will reach our goal, as we've planned for flexibility! </b>Our target ($4,150) is for our largest, most grandiose vision.<b> </b>We have alternate plans to reduce the size of the labyrinth if necessary, which allows us to reduce costs significantly, without reducing quality. If we do need to change the size, the perks (and timeline for receiving them) will not be affected!<br/>
</div>
<div>
<b>In the event that we raise MORE than the necessary $4,150</b>, the additional funds will go toward financial assistance for veterans who want to attend our workshops!</div>
<div>
<b>We anticipate completing the project by March/April 2017. </b>We'll keep you updated throughout the construction process, and once complete, we'll begin extending invitations to those who donated $500 or more.</div>
<div>
<b>When will you receive your perk? Everyone</b> who donates is appreciated! For those who donate enough to receive a perk:</div>
<div>Jams ($100 perk) will go out soon after the campaign closes, you should have them by early June. </div>
<div>Plaque photos ($250+ perk) will be sent out (electronically) promptly after the center,and final, piece is placed in April 2017.</div>
<div>For $500+ donations, invitations to visit will be extended, as with the plaque photos, in March/April 2017. </div>

</div></div>","Summary of Operation Peaceful Paths


Operation Peaceful Paths is our effort to bring together Veterans and the Ecovillage experience while constructing a 30-40 ft. (diameter) Labyrinth at Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage (my community and home, in Rutledge, MO).
       Here are the two templates we are considering, The Abigndon, and the Breamore.

And I'm certainly not doing this alone! I am grateful and honored to partner with the local Bed and Breakfast, The Milkweed Mercantile, to host two Veterans workshops specializing in Yoga Nidra, AKA ""Yogic Sleep"", 24 Veterans in total, hosted by Sami Aaron, Certified Level 1 Instructor in Mindful Resilience for Trauma Recovery with the Veterans Yoga Project.

            Sami Aaron, Instructor               La Casa, where mediation classes will be held


Building the Labyrinth (working title ""Horizon"")


                      Proposed Labyrinth locations at Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage


In summer 2016, the Milkweed Mercantile at Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage is hosting two workshops for veterans - one for men and one for women. In these workshops Sami will be teaching Yoga Nidra and other self-care and healing techniques. In between yoga and meditation session we will be building a labyrinth. The purpose is to give workshop participants the opportunity to do something physical and to practice what they are learning in a different setting. 

We want to build something meaningful, that everyone can use; a labyrinth will be a significant contribution to the Dancing Rabbit community, and everyone will be welcome to come and walk it after it is completed. We see the labyrinth as a tangible symbol of veterans working for peace, both towards others and within ourselves.
This project, with your help, will create shared, free-to-use infrastructure at Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage; the story of it's construction and contemplative beauty touching the lives of all who visit the community for years to come!

A little about me...


   
My name is Lucas. I served with the Marine Corps for four years (2002-06), and with the Army for three (2007-10). In my service, I deployed to many countries throughout both the Asia-Pacific and European regions, the most notable being my combat tours in Iraq; I deployed to Fallujah in 2004-05, and to Kirkuk in 2008-10. 
After I left the service, I struggled to find solid footing, and those I cared about could do little else but watch as I took my frustrations out on myself, through a terrible drinking problem, and also on them, as I was often distant and harshly critical of those around me. I felt lost and confused, separate yet crowded, and I watched as some who I served with struggled with the same emotions. 
It took almost two years of therapy (though the VA) along with a LOT of personal work to  begin finding peace within myself, and to change the way I relate to others; and nothing has done more to help me rediscover the best parts of myself than supporting efforts for peace such as Veterans For Peace, and introducing Veterans to the ideas of Environmental and Interpersonal sustainability (non-violent communication). If you'd like to know more about my personal journey the last few years, here's my blog site, The Home Front Fight.
   What We Need & What You Get

We seek to raise $4,150.00, which will cover the base cost of materials for the Labyrinth, such as the gravel for leveling, the labyrinth weed barrier/template  (biodegradable), brick for path outlines (reclaimed), smooth ""river rock"" for the paths (sourced locally), and the plaque (centerpiece). 
Labyrinth planning, design, sales tax, and ongoing maintenance are all being covered at my personal expense (Lucas). 
I am also personally covering any additional labor effort/costs beyond the workshop(June/August 2016) attendees who volunteer. 

We will reach our goal, as we've planned for flexibility! Our target ($4,150) is for our largest, most grandiose vision. We have alternate plans to reduce the size of the labyrinth if necessary, which allows us to reduce costs significantly, without reducing quality. If we do need to change the size, the perks (and timeline for receiving them) will not be affected!


In the event that we raise MORE than the necessary $4,150, the additional funds will go toward financial assistance for veterans who want to attend our workshops!

We anticipate completing the project by March/April 2017. We'll keep you updated throughout the construction process, and once complete, we'll begin extending invitations to those who donated $500 or more.

When will you receive your perk? Everyone who donates is appreciated! For those who donate enough to receive a perk:
Jams ($100 perk) will go out soon after the campaign closes, you should have them by early June. 
Plaque photos ($250+ perk) will be sent out (electronically) promptly after the center,and final, piece is placed in April 2017.
For $500+ donations, invitations to visit will be extended, as with the plaque photos, in March/April 2017. 


    Risks & Challenges

The biggest challenge we are facing is financing. That's why we're here :-)
Our additional challenges are ensuring that we produce a high-quality, durable labyrinth with a low ecological footprint. Here's how we have risen to these challenges so far:

Low ecological footprint- this is our primary concern; we are an ecologically-minded community, and we want our infrastructure to shine particularly bright in that regard. The only material that we are using that is NOT locally sourced and/or reclaimed will be the Labyrinth template (see below), which is an eco-friendly design.


Quality and durability- We have chosen to use a template from The Labyrinth Company. It is made of a biodegradable polymer, and the path design is printed in eco-friendly heat-set ink. The template will ensure that we create a well-proportioned, precisely crafted Labyrinth, free of pesky weeds and creeping grasses.

And, of course, there is the ever-present challenge of the weather, which could potentially push the timeline back; I've planned extra time into the completion date for setbacks, and we'll be keeping you updated along the way!

<p><strong>Reproductive rights are in a state of emergency.</strong></p>
<p>Forcing women to have children against their will is a form of enslavement.  Yet, we are on track for 2013 to be the 3rd year in a row with record restrictions on women's access to abortion. 97% of rural counties do not have an abortion provider, 5 states have only one abortion clinic, new laws are closing the doors of abortion clinics nation-wide, abortion providers face unending harrassment and threat and abortion is more stigmatized than ever.</p>
<p>Women are full human beings who must have the right – through unrestricted and unstigmatized access to birth control and abortion – to decide for themselves when and whether they will have children.  For decades, a movement which calls itself “pro-life” has unleashed violence against abortion providers, shamed and humiliated women, and relentlessly restricted access to abortion, especially for poor women.  We must wage a determined fight to TURN THIS AROUND.  </p>
<p><strong>THE ABORTION RIGHTS FREEDOM RIDE</strong></p>
<p>This summer, from July 24-August 25, after send-off rallies in New York City and San Francisco, caravans will travel from both coasts, rallying and gathering support along the way, arriving in North Dakota before August 1 when new laws are set to shut down the last abortion clinic in the state. Then, down to Wichita where those who courageously re-opened the clinic of Dr. George Tiller following his assassination by an anti-abortion gunman are facing serious, and escalating threat. On to Jackson, Mississippi where a temporary court injunction is the only thing keeping the last remaining clinic in the state open. All along the way, we’ll organize rallies for abortion rights, we'll erect visual displays that tell the truth about abortion and birth control, collect and amplify women’s abortion stories in order to break the silence, defend the clinics and providers most under attack, and meet with people to build lasting organization to DEFEAT the whole war on women.</p>
<p>We must all take responsiblity for stopping the reversal of abortion and birth control rights.</p>
<p><strong>THE FUNDS WE NEED</strong></p>
<p>$22,000 will put the Abortion Rights Freedom Ride on the road. This will cover the cost of van rentals from both coasts, gas and other travel expenses. It will pay for thousands of leaflets, palm-cards, and stickers as well as banners to honor abortion providers. It will help toward costs of visual displays. Most of all, this will help make it possible for the Abortion Rights Freedom Riders, including a crew of inspiring young activists who would not otherwise be able to be part of this to be on the road for a full month. We will need to do additional fundraising during the month-long ride, including raising the $6,600 needed to publish the statement for Abortion on Demand Without Apology as a full page in color on Sunday in the 3 main newspapers in North Dakota before August 1.  <span>A successful campaign now will make a decisive difference. </span></p>

The cost to the families will be only for transportation to and from

$300.00 or $9600.00 for all 32.  Room and board for
10 adults will be $3000.  The cost of
medical personnel will be $2000.00 and activities personnel will be $1500.00.  We are tying to have medical and activities
equipment and supplies donated but if not that could cost between $1-2000.00.  Medical and camp liability insurance will
cost between $2-3000.00.  Camp and
Activities directors will be volunteer board members and there will be other
volunteers to help with such activities as pottery class, sports and nature
hikes.  Therefore we are trying to raise

<p>Prior to 1970, children like Casey and Sam often did not survive or were very physically limited. 
In the 1970’s a surgical procedure (Fontan) gave those that survived to 4–5
years a chance to be more physically active. 
In the 1980’s and 90’s, surgeries in infancy allowed many more of
them to survive.  Today 90% of these children survive, most of
them functioning at 90 – 95% of the physical endurance of children without
heart conditions.  It is so important
that these children have every opportunity to live and play like other
children.  That is why a summer camp for
heart children is so important.  It is
often hard for families of these children to afford camps or travel long distances.  That is why Oregon and every state should have a heart camp. 
You can make a difference in the lives of these children.</p><p><br/></p>

25 years ago by parents of a child with a heart condition where their child
could go to summer camp.  I realized
there had never been a summer camp for these children in Oregon and sent my
patients to two camps in California for the next 25 years.  My dream has been to have a summer camp for
heart children in Oregon.  We are
partnering with Camp Howard to have our first camp this summer, August 25 –
29.  That can only happen if you help us
raise sufficient funds.     Casey in hospital after surgery                           Casey nowEight of 1000 children are born with heart conditions and
half of these are serious conditions requiring heart surgery and other
procedures, hospitalizations and taking medications.  Many of these children are embarrassed by
their scars and have never met another child with a heart condition.  In the following videos, you will meet 2 boys,
Casey and Sam, who have only 1 instead of 2 pumping chambers in their heart.  They and their parents will explain why
Oregon needs a heart camp.
We plan to have 32 heart kids attend our first camp.  There will be a pediatric cardiologist, 2 cardiac
nurses, 8 counselors, a lifeguard and an archery instructor to make sure the children
have lots of fun in a safe environment. 
The cost to the families will be only for transportation to and from
camp.  However the cost per camper is
$300.00 or $9600.00 for all 32.  Room and board for
10 adults will be $3000.  The cost of
medical personnel will be $2000.00 and activities personnel will be $1500.00.  We are tying to have medical and activities
equipment and supplies donated but if not that could cost between $1-2000.00.  Medical and camp liability insurance will
cost between $2-3000.00.  Camp and
Activities directors will be volunteer board members and there will be other
volunteers to help with such activities as pottery class, sports and nature
hikes.  Therefore we are trying to raise
$20,000.00 to make this camp happen this summer.  If we do not reach our goal and cannot fund
the camp, we will use the money to have our first camp in summer 2015.

<h3>Pan de Vida/Bread of Life</h3>
<p>My name is Maria Del Valle-Tucker.  My husband Don and I are missionaries to the country of Nicaragua.  Nicaragua being the second poorest country in the Western Hemisphere.  Our ministry is called Pan de Vida/Bread of Life.  My husband has been in country since last year while I stay here and fund raise (no easy task).  We run a feeding program as well as a bible study where we feed an average of 90 children daily.  For many this is their only meal.</p>
<p>This campaign is important because the funds will allow us to continue feeding for the rest of the year.  We are looking to raise $5,000, which will provide the funds for the food for the rest of this year, as it cost us about $500 a month for the feedings alone without any other expenses included.  We can not continue to do this without your help.</p>
<p>We also provide uniforms since the children cannot go to school without uniforms and many parents cannot afford to buy them</p>
<p>In the video you will see a typical feeding where it starts out by being lead in prayer by one of our volunteers.</p>
<p>We are located in the community of Los Martinez, in Managua.  A community of unpaved roads, homes made of tin or whatever material they can find, a very poor community, as you can see from this short video.  A community where people live on less than a dollar a day.  We would love to do more than what we are doing but we need people to come along side of us and help.  Would you partner with us? </p>
<p>This year 2013, so far we have provided over 3000 meals.  We have provided over 60 children with uniforms and/or school supplies for this school year which started in February.</p>
<p>No child should go to bed hungry and you can help us provide for the children of Los Martinez by praying, donating and sharing the link.  You could also plan a visit.  We would love for you to come help and be able to see for yourself what is being done.   You can send me a message on facebook.  You can also see more pictures on Pan de Vida, facebook page.</p>

with a twist - a disability. I had polio at age 3 and use a wheelchair due to post-polio
syndrome. </p><p>I started working as a journalist at age 15 when the Halifax Mail Star published my weekly record review column. I became an entertainment journalist, later covering business and technology.  In 2007, I established NJN Network as an online news journal covering local politics as well.</p><p>I am also a disability advocate for people living with disabilities.  I've worked for the March of Dimes and Rotary, among the many not-for-profits, helping people with disabilities for 30 years. 
</p><p>
</p><p>I need help with the costs of legal
reference books which will give me the knowledge needed to win a Human Rights case against the PEI press gallery.</p><p>In 2009, the PEI press gallery revoked my press pass because in their words their was ""no room in the inn"" for a wheelchair-bound journalist who advocated for people with disabilities.  It's hard to believe they would show disability prejudice in this era but things like this do happen. The press gallery took away the ability to do my job. </p><p>People often show prejudice due to ignorance and fear. I was the first disabled journalist they had ever seen. They also did not like my quick adoption of new media when their journalism jobs were being threatened.</p><p></p><p>During the meeting to revoke my press pass, my volunteer work for people with disabilities was cited 10 times as
reason to eject me. They also said a blogger could not be a journalist. Then several journalists admitted blogging in their jobs.  </p><p>The
press gallery said volunteer work for the disabled was the same as a paid
political lobbyist. The charges are so obviously false it will be easy to refute
them, if I ever get to the Human Rights Hearing.</p><p></p><p>On May 29, 2014 I will be arguing a Judicial Review Application by the Press Gallery that will impact the future of this case. If I win the motion, we go back to the Human Rights Commission. If
not, I face another 2 years in court before the matter is every heard.</p>
<p>This case will impact have a profound positive
or negative impact on the human rights of people with disabilities. We either
have the right to free speech, freedom of association and our jobs or we don’t.</p>
<p></p><p></p><p>This is a classic David and Goliath battle
that can be won. The press gallery has defended the Complaint with the backing of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and Transcontinental, the
publisher of The Charlottetown Guardian.

with a twist - a disability. I had polio at age 3 and use a wheelchair due to post-polio
syndrome. I started working as a journalist at age 15 when the Halifax Mail Star published my weekly record review column. I became an entertainment journalist, later covering business and technology.  In 2007, I established NJN Network as an online news journal covering local politics as well.I am also a disability advocate for people living with disabilities.  I've worked for the March of Dimes and Rotary, among the many not-for-profits, helping people with disabilities for 30 years. 

I need help with the costs of legal
reference books which will give me the knowledge needed to win a Human Rights case against the PEI press gallery.In 2009, the PEI press gallery revoked my press pass because in their words their was ""no room in the inn"" for a wheelchair-bound journalist who advocated for people with disabilities.  It's hard to believe they would show disability prejudice in this era but things like this do happen. The press gallery took away the ability to do my job. People often show prejudice due to ignorance and fear. I was the first disabled journalist they had ever seen. They also did not like my quick adoption of new media when their journalism jobs were being threatened.During the meeting to revoke my press pass, my volunteer work for people with disabilities was cited 10 times as
reason to eject me. They also said a blogger could not be a journalist. Then several journalists admitted blogging in their jobs.  The
press gallery said volunteer work for the disabled was the same as a paid
political lobbyist. The charges are so obviously false it will be easy to refute
them, if I ever get to the Human Rights Hearing.On May 29, 2014 I will be arguing a Judicial Review Application by the Press Gallery that will impact the future of this case. If I win the motion, we go back to the Human Rights Commission. If
not, I face another 2 years in court before the matter is every heard.
This case will impact have a profound positive
or negative impact on the human rights of people with disabilities. We either
have the right to free speech, freedom of association and our jobs or we don’t.
This is a classic David and Goliath battle
that can be won. The press gallery has defended the Complaint with the backing of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) and Transcontinental, the
publisher of The Charlottetown Guardian. 
Both of these corporations have human rights policies that prohibit discrimination but are fighting by proxy to keep me from returning to the PEI Legislature.
Does it seem odd that newspapers and TV
stations would fight against freedom of speech, freedom of the press and volunteering to
keep a wheelchair bound reporter from reporting the news? The CBC has spent more
than $70,000 in legal fees to keep the Human Rights Commission from conducting
a public Tribunal or Hearing.  While the
CBC is not named in the case, through freedom of information I was able to get
the lawyers’s invoices dating back to 2010. The CBC is paying the bills. The
lawyer admitted that the case is called “Pate vs. CBC / Transcontinental”.What I Need & What You Get$2,756 will buy legal research books and multi-volume law libraries like ""Judicial Review"", ""Discrimination and the Law"" and ""Canadian Human Rights Reporter"".

<h3>The Occupy Wall Street Screenprinters Cooperative</h3>
<p><span>The Occupy Wall Street Screenprinters Co-op was born out of three OWS Screen Guild members who decided to print for the occupation full time. We make prints for free, and accept donations for tees or tote bags. In this way, we have raised a substantial amount of money and support for the OWS General Fund, as well as servicing other Occupy groups in need of printing. From our origins at the Zuccotti Park encampment, we have become a mainstay of the occupation, popping up at events with ink and screens to share our art with The People. Our Cooperative is currently made up of three members who seek to establish a new paradigm in the apparel industry, and our mission is threefold:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Creating sustainably sourced apparel with a message</strong>
<ul>
<li>No sweatshop tees here! We seek recycled, organic, and/or union made printables whenever we can. Our upcycle project features one of a kind, gently used apparel with carefully selected prints, reducing the environmental impact and calling attention to injustices in the present apparel industry.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Establishing fair labor practices through a cooperative model</strong>
<ul>
<li>After 6 months volunteering with the OWS Screen Guild, we realized our project had the potential to grow into something very big. The support we recieved from the Occupy community, was astounding. In order to meet the demand for tees,  we set up shop in a donated workspace and began taking custom orders for OWS affiliated projects. As a worker owned co-op, we strive to keep our tees and totes affordable to all. We are developng a horizontal management structure and a fair division of labor.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Ensuring affordability to all, with a suggested donation pay structure</strong>
<ul>
<li>This is perhaps the most crucial aspect of our project. Occupy Wall Street is a movement of the 99%, made up of people with little to no discretionary income. We want everyone to be able to wear our shirts, regardless of what they are able to pay. For us, solidarity and outreach are infinitely more important than what we have in the bank. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your donation will help us set up our new Occupied Print Shop! In exchange, we'll send you some of our nifty printed wares. We're now paying rent on a studio space, but we need help with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establishing an inventory of blank tees and tote bags</li>
<li>Purchasing a laptop (or hopefully two!) and Adobe Photoshop design software</li>
<li>Paying for legal counsel to properly establish ourselves as an LLC</li>
<li>Creating a web store (in partnership with <a href=""http://www.occuprint.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Occuprint"">Occuprint</a>) to expand our tees to the world!</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have had the honor of printing for some really wonderful projects. Our tees are quite the conversation starter! Since our days in Zuccotti Park, we have been a tool for promoting solidarity, inducting newcomers to the movement, and bringing art directly to the 99%.</p>
<p><strong>Some of our recent projects include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Mini-kites to send in solidarity to Tahrir Square, Egypt </li>
<li>Scarves to send to Vietnam in coordination with the Vietnam Agent Orange Relief Responsibility Campaign</li>
<li>""Team OWS"" tee shirts for the NYC AIDS Walk </li>
<li>A booth at the New York City Green Festival</li>
<li>Anti-retailing at the Brooklyn Food Conference</li>

While driving through rural Orgeon last fall, Ultra was pulled over for 
speeding (53 in a 45) and arrested for possession of medical marijuana..  She now faces serious criminal charges are likely to result in real jail time and a steep fine.  To help out, a group of friends came together to organize the Ultra Legal Defense Fund.

Who is this Ultra person?  
For over ten years Ultra has 
produced & choreographed high-concept fashion performances with 
dozens celebrating diverse forms of beauty at charity benefits, 
department stores, nightclubs and raves (as well as traditional theater 
spaces).
Ultra has bewitched, bothered, and 
bewildered people since he was born through his boundary-dissolving 
sense of fashion & style.  His brilliance is often seen in Ultra's frequent thought-provoking 
deconstructions of clothing's unseen possibilities, available in stores 
through her ""Piecemeal"" fashion line.   



In the 1990s Ultra's performance troupe, the P.L.O. (the Polyester Liberation Organization) opened hundreds of minds and hearts on both coasts with dozens of shows with large casts in Washington, D.C., New York and Seattle.    The PLO took audiences by storm, making them laugh while revolutionizing their understanding of fashion's impact on gender and our personal lives. 

 
Ultra has became a well-loved fixture of 
Seattle's booming burlesque performance community.   And he needs our help.  It is time for us come together for Ultra.

Trouble in Oregon

Ultra's arrest for medical marijuana raises many troubling questions.   
Ultra lives each day as a walking fashion performance art installation (as celebrated in the recent Bill Cunninham in New York).   But was Ultra targeted for the way she looks?

Throughout history the most visionary genderqueers (like  Leigh Bowery or Kevin Aviance) are often singled out to get bashed & persecuted simply because they attract a lot of attention just by being themselves.  Are we going to allow visionary queers to go it alone, or should we as a community stand up & support queer visionary artists in trouble like Ultra?  


What if this had happened to you?  Would you like to deal with the consequences alone?
What does it mean to support a friend?



What Ultra is Facing 


An upcoming court date on February 23rd.   

At least ten days of real jail time.
A hefty fine of over $1,000
Over $6,000 of defense lawyer fees.
18 Months of probation 
Weeks of lost work wages

<p><strong>ABOUT SAFE STORAGE LOCKERS:</strong></p>
<p>Everyone has a fundamental human right to housing. <strong>The Safe Storage Locker program aims to increase the chances for people to transition off the streets and into permanent housing, by providing a personal connection and a place to safely store personal belongings. </strong> </p>
<p>This pilot program, hosted by the nonprofit BasicsPNW, began as a concept by unhoused and housed community members in Bellingham, WA as a way to address the prevalent and vital need for secure storage among people without housing. </p>
<p>A safe place to store belongings offers an opportunity to go about daily life (to work, job hunt, attend classes, use public transportation, go to appointments, and work on daily goals) without the constant mental and physical burden of carrying one's belongings everywhere, all day long.</p>
<p><strong>THE CAMPAIGN:</strong></p>
<p><strong>This Indiegogo fundraising campaign will provide the needed funds for purchasing and installing the first set of outdoor Safe Storage Lockers in downtown Bellingham.</strong></p>
<p>The lockers will be approximately 6' x 2' x 2’, accessible 24/7, sturdy, weatherproof, secure, and leased on a monthly basis. Staff will meet with each locker tenant throughout their lease to help break down housing barriers, work on personal goals, connect with services, and build relationships.</p>
<p>We believe this personal connection and support will be key to the success of the locker program and to helping people transition off the streets. This connection and support sets our program apart from typical storage programs, making Safe Storage Lockers unique within the U.S.A.    <strong>         </strong></p>
<p><strong>Safe Storage Lockers will improve the lives of people in our community in a real and tangible way. </strong></p>
<p>In a survey, respondents left us these messages about the importance of having a safe place to store belongings:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>""The inability to drag [belongings] with you all day, [is] physically and mentally draining in an already draining situation.""</i></strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>""It's always a setback having to replace things again, and again.""</i></strong></p>
<p><strong>And, this program is about more than just a safe place to store belongings</strong>, it's about building relationships, strengthening community, and preventing trauma.<strong> </strong>It's about making sure that everyone in our community is able to meet their basic needs and has an opportunity to thrive. It's about love, respect, safety and compassion. </p>

<h3>What is GEQUA and What is Our Project?</h3>
<p><em>During our program, Columbia University students will collaborate with Ecuadorian leaders to support indigenous and women's groups in their work to sustain healthy living and just working conditions.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>GEQUA has been going to Ecuador for more than 5 years, working with FBU, a local NGO headed by Ecuadorian leadership</li>
<li>GEQUA engages in both long-term and short-term projects which the community emphasizes are critical to their development and progress</li>
</ul>
<p>By donating to this campaign, you will contribute greatly to an <strong>irrigation project</strong> that will bring economic independence to more than 250 families in rural Ecuador.  </p>
<ul>
<li>The drought in Ecuador this year has devasted crops, thus raising food prices, and destroying the livelihoods of many indigenous subsistence farmers.</li>
<li>Women in particular are severely affected (see more in ""Impact"" below)</li>
<li>The irrigation system will allow them to be more successful independent from the fluctuations of weather.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p><em><strong>Thanks to everyone who donated to Part I of our fundraising during our first campaign!</strong> <strong>See more here:</strong> <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/gequaecuador"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.indiegogo.com/gequaecuador</a></em></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Break it down for folks in more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to raise $8,000 this year.  This money will go towards the irrigation project mentioned above as well as the sustainability of the program so that we can continue to make increasingly effective contributons in our partnership with the Ecuadorian community.</li>
<li>We want you, our supporters to really feel like you are part of our community and our movement to increase cross-cultural solidarity.  To this end, we have a blog where we post regular updates about our preparation to ensure thoughtful service. Also, if you donate $50 or more, we include you on our List of Friends on this website.  </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This year, we focus on understanding and supporting alternatives for women forced by economic circumstances to work in <strong>harmful rose plantations.</strong>  </p>
<ul>

<h3>The Program Model</h3>
<p>Our model challenges students to engage head-on at the cross-section of scholarly engagement (thought) and responsible international service (action). Most of our group members have participated in some form of service in the past, but part of GEQUA’s mission is to create service whose impact is both relevant to the needs of the community and sustainable for future years.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>a. Pre-departure training</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The 12 students accepted into the program devote at least 5 hours a week to plan,<br/>fundraise, and undergo training. Participants understand the context of gender equality issues in both the US and Ecuador through a pre-trip curriculum over a period of 10 weeks before departing for spring break. Speakers for the pre-trip program include past participants, University professors and staff members with extensive international research and service experience, as well as members of local NGOs. By inviting other local actors (i.e., other university students, international organizations, and other non-governmental organizations) to participate in program components, students initiate relationships that support an international network of leaders.  Additionally, each student takes up responsibility to hold at least one fundraiser.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>b. Service trip to Ecuador</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>During the week long trip, students partner with local leaders and community members to experience women’s work through community service projects, talks, workshops, and mingas. Every day, we meet with a different woman leader to discuss issues pertaining to her specific line of work. Our community service projects complement these interactions by exposing our group to concrete realities and needs: working on family farms; supporting our partner organization’s efforts in re-forestation and organic tree farming; assisting on the eco-agricultural hacienda; volunteering at the local school and infant center; and empowering alternatives for women and children to escape the rose plantation industry.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>c. Post-trip Symposium:</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>After the service trip, participants hold a forum about the experiences in Ecuador and<br/>about what they learned. The purpose of the forum is to teach other Columbia students and administrators about their experiences/ what was learned and about future projects and potential partnerships in Ecuador.</p>

</div></div>","What is GEQUA and What is Our Project?
During our program, Columbia University students will collaborate with Ecuadorian leaders to support indigenous and women's groups in their work to sustain healthy living and just working conditions.

GEQUA has been going to Ecuador for more than 5 years, working with FBU, a local NGO headed by Ecuadorian leadership
GEQUA engages in both long-term and short-term projects which the community emphasizes are critical to their development and progress

By donating to this campaign, you will contribute greatly to an irrigation project that will bring economic independence to more than 250 families in rural Ecuador.  

The drought in Ecuador this year has devasted crops, thus raising food prices, and destroying the livelihoods of many indigenous subsistence farmers.
Women in particular are severely affected (see more in ""Impact"" below)
The irrigation system will allow them to be more successful independent from the fluctuations of weather.



Thanks to everyone who donated to Part I of our fundraising during our first campaign! See more here: www.indiegogo.com/gequaecuador
What We Need & What You Get
Break it down for folks in more detail:

We need to raise $8,000 this year.  This money will go towards the irrigation project mentioned above as well as the sustainability of the program so that we can continue to make increasingly effective contributons in our partnership with the Ecuadorian community.
We want you, our supporters to really feel like you are part of our community and our movement to increase cross-cultural solidarity.  To this end, we have a blog where we post regular updates about our preparation to ensure thoughtful service. Also, if you donate $50 or more, we include you on our List of Friends on this website.  



The Impact
This year, we focus on understanding and supporting alternatives for women forced by economic circumstances to work in harmful rose plantations.  

These women come into contact with pesticides every day that cause cancer, lead to physically and mentally disabled children, and even barrenness, all within 3-5 years.
These women are already finding solutions like starting organic rose farms, and feeding themselves through their own community development
The irrigation project mentioned above will bring water to their fields so that they are successful in their independent endeavors.
Help us support them by donating whatever you can.  Every dollar counts.  

The Program Model

Most of our group members have participated in some form of service in the past, but part of GEQUA’s mission is to create service whose impact is both relevant to the needs of the community and sustainable for future years.

a. Pre-departure training

<h2>A little backstory first…</h2>
<p>My name is Anjali Alwis. I graduated from Syracuse University in 2017 with a degree in TV, Radio, Film and have been working in all three of those departments over the past two years.</p>
<p>I will be going to three refugee camps in Lebanon for eight days with MedGlobal. In that time, we will be shooting three pieces: two shorter pieces that highlight the important work that MedGlobal is doing, and a longer documentary.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1553201256/xcmrxio2dsha1dxofunl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The two shorter videos are focused on how MedGlobal is combating health disparity through the remarkable work being done by doctors, nurses, and volunteers, it’s partnerships with local organizations, and it’s focus on a sustainable impact.</p>
<p>The third project is a longer documentary about the camps and the people in them. I went on a mission Summer 2016 to Thessaloniki, Greece and was overwhelmed, saddened and inspired by the stories I heard of everyday life; of the mother who was an accomplished artist in Syria, a daughter who dreamed of being a pilot, a friend who only had two years left until a college degree in teaching. I'd like this documentary to focus on how devastating it is, not just for the individual but society at large, when talented, bright, passionate individuals are forced to put their lives on hold, waiting in a refugee camp.</p>

<h2>What We Need </h2>
<p><strong>Our Budget:</strong></p>
<p>The first $2,500 raised towards this will go towards these projects for MedGlobal: equipment, production costs, and actual travel expenses. Any money raised over our budget will be donated directly to MedGlobal. This money is used to purchase medications, surgical supplies, nutritional supplements, toiletries and clothing for refugees in the camps in Lebanon.</p>
<p>Some numbers are a rough estimate as we are waiting on a complete itinerary. This page will be updated accordingly.</p>

<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>Two years ago, while on a medical mission in Greece, I wrote, edited, and produced (with the guidance of WAER and WWFM) a six-part series, “Six Degrees of Separation” that was picked up on stations across the United States. Each segment tells the tales of different people and issues from the refugee camp, their arduous and dangerous journeys in a search for safety.  The stories of those affected, and those trying to help, are told largely in their own words, with creative production using poetry and music.</p>

It keeps them in the public eye and forces the world to think deeply about this humanitarian crisis. And in turn, even more people are inspired to care, donate, and make change.
If you're reading this and feeling like you would like to give directly, great! Links below to donate directly to two organizations that are helping refugees (there are many but I know the work done by these ones).

<h3>Operation Eviction Intervention<br/>
</h3> <p>Our friend and neighbour is having a mental health crisis that has brought him very close to being evicted. If evicted, it is likely he will be homeless.

<p>We have already passed the hat among our own immediate community, and now need to ask our larger communities to consider helping our friend out. We have a chance to keep someone from becoming homeless. If you can kick in a few bucks, we'd be grateful, and I know our friend will be too. <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Our goal is to raise $2700. This will cover the $1800 he needs to pay in order to have his eviction revoked, plus $600 for his November rent, plus $300 to cover the Indiegogo fees and currency conversion. This will get our friend out of immediate danger of eviction so he can get past this crisis and focus on his health.<br/></p>

<p>    Voices of the Past and Present is a film that encapsulates the struggles, work, dedication, and growing involvement in humanitarian efforts to change the way the United States has ignored police brutality towards the African American community and the changing of the Judicial system. Our goal of this film is to enlighten and bring awareness to Black Lives Matter, and the dedication to getting justice for the Black and Brown lives taken over the years. By showcasing the movement we plan on educating our audience on racism and discrimination and how the African American community is affected by the history of this country. We also want to share the raw emotion of those that work endlessly to bring these peaceful protests and rallies to life. </p>

summer The Ukrainian Youth Association runs summer camps across the globe for
youth and for all ages. 
</p>
<p>However
this summer is <i>different.</i>  Ukraine is fighting a war in its’ Eastern
Regions and 100,000’s of children have lost their homes or have been relocated away from
their friends. Many have fathers and/or mothers on the front, and some have
lost parents or loved ones in this war. According to a recent <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/20/world/europe/ukraine-conflict/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>UNICEF report,</span></a> over 1.7 million children have been
affected by this war. It is for this reason that UYA has decided to run a camp
for these children in Ukraine.  </p>
<p>The
camp will be held in the Chernihiv province of Ukraine, under the watchful eye
of volunteers from across the globe, traveling at their own expense to support
these children.  Camp dates are from August 9 to 22.</p>
<p>The
adult to child ratio for the camp will be no more than 1 to 10 children to one
supervisor.  It is our hope to be able to
fund camp attendance for 75 children from across Ukraine.</p>
<p>The
cost to send a single child to camp for 2 weeks is: 300CAD. This cost
includes 3 meals, and 2 snacks, travel costs for campers and any and all
activities planned for the camp. The Canadian Ukrainian Youth Association has committed to a minimum donation of 4000$ to ensure that the camp runs smoothly and as many possible children can attend.  If we are able to raise more than this amount, we can add additional activities to the program!</p>
<p>Planned activities
at camp include:</p>
<p>Sports
activities, arts and crafts, health and wellness, singing, and an opportunity for these children to relax and make new and, hopefully, lifelong friends!</p><p>We ask you to visit the updates section of  our  campaign page as we will be posting additional information there as it becomes available.  </p>

<p>We are Monica &amp; Samantha.  We are sisters-in-law, and in Haiti we'll be sisters in service.  <strong>Together we are donating our time, our skills, and our love to help the people of northern Haiti.</strong></p>
<p>We are pooling our resources to go the poorest country in the western hemisphere, putting a halt to the busyness of our lives here in the US, taking time from work, and raising the funds to get us there and to supply our mission.</p>
<p>The Northern Haiti Hope Foundation is based in Warrenton, Virginia and operates on the motto of ""this community for that community.""  For us, it goes deeper: this family for those families.  Your donation can help us help others.  <strong>There is hope in northern Haiti, please help us get there.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>About your donation:</strong></p>
<p>Your donation will help us cover the cost of travel, basic accommodation, and materials for serving the people of Terrier Rouge, Haiti.  The trip is scheduled for 21-28 October 2012, and will focus primarily on supporting the local school, clinic, and orphanage.  In addition, we will help distribute food to the very needy and determine the next steps for reducing the spread of cholera through providing access to clean drinking water. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What are the goals of the Northern Haiti Hope Foundation?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Furthering the efforts of Pere Bruno in educating over 800 children at <em>Saint Barthelemy School</em> in Terrier Rouge and supporting the adjacent <em>Esperance et Vie</em> medical clinic.</li>
<li>Employing local villagers to prepare water wells in remote areas that have been decimated with cholera due a lack of access to clean water. </li>
<li>Distributing food and nourishment to the aging citizens still living in abandoned factory towns along northern coast.</li>
<li>Supporting the <em>Kay Anj Orphanage</em> in the city of Cap Haitien (helpinghaitianangels.org).</li>
</ul><p>For more, visit northernhaitihope.org</p>
<p><strong>Why Northern Haiti?<br/></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Haiti is one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world. It has struggled with problems ranging from near-constant political upheaval, health crises, an annual barrage of hurricanes and the worst earthquake in the region in more than 200 years.</li>
<li>With our help, there is hope.  In this province of Haiti, there are those making a differnce for their own community.  This is how lasting change happens - from the ground up - and it's within this mission that we find hope. </li>
</ul><p><strong>How can I help?</strong></p>

We are Monica & Samantha.  We are sisters-in-law, and in Haiti we'll be sisters in service.  Together we are donating our time, our skills, and our love to help the people of northern Haiti.
We are pooling our resources to go the poorest country in the western hemisphere, putting a halt to the busyness of our lives here in the US, taking time from work, and raising the funds to get us there and to supply our mission.
The Northern Haiti Hope Foundation is based in Warrenton, Virginia and operates on the motto of ""this community for that community.""  For us, it goes deeper: this family for those families.  Your donation can help us help others.  There is hope in northern Haiti, please help us get there.
 
About your donation:
Your donation will help us cover the cost of travel, basic accommodation, and materials for serving the people of Terrier Rouge, Haiti.  The trip is scheduled for 21-28 October 2012, and will focus primarily on supporting the local school, clinic, and orphanage.  In addition, we will help distribute food to the very needy and determine the next steps for reducing the spread of cholera through providing access to clean drinking water. 
 
What are the goals of the Northern Haiti Hope Foundation?

Furthering the efforts of Pere Bruno in educating over 800 children at Saint Barthelemy School in Terrier Rouge and supporting the adjacent Esperance et Vie medical clinic.
Employing local villagers to prepare water wells in remote areas that have been decimated with cholera due a lack of access to clean water. 
Distributing food and nourishment to the aging citizens still living in abandoned factory towns along northern coast.
Supporting the Kay Anj Orphanage in the city of Cap Haitien (helpinghaitianangels.org).

Why Northern Haiti?

Haiti is one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world. It has struggled with problems ranging from near-constant political upheaval, health crises, an annual barrage of hurricanes and the worst earthquake in the region in more than 200 years.
With our help, there is hope.  In this province of Haiti, there are those making a differnce for their own community.  This is how lasting change happens - from the ground up - and it's within this mission that we find hope. 
How can I help?

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We have experienced the vulnerability and fear people have about homelessness and homeless people.

<p>Many people feel frustrated that such a wealthy planet has people without shelter literally dying on the streets, and others just feel scared a homeless person (or someone they think is homeless) will threaten their safety. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494435811/jnc9uflh3jpkprjokhtq.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><a href=""http://a-place-to-call-home.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""A Place to Call Home""</a> fosters greater understanding from the stories ""caught"" and shared in the various media in which our artists work.  This results in greater connection to the humanity of us all, and translates to less fear. <strong>Through capturing and sharing fascinating stories of those involved  and connected with the homeless community, </strong><i><strong>we have already experienced more compassion and generosity by the people listening to the audio segments, viewing photographs and fine art, reading the essays and stories, and listening to the original music created by our artists.</strong></i><br/><br/>By August, 2017, we will have caught, recorded, and shared 60 <a href=""https://www.a-place-to-call-home.org/audio-story-showcase"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">audio stories</a> from homeless people, those organizations working with the homeless, concerned citizens, and officials charged with finding solutions.

<p>They will be helping us produce the <strong>documentary film</strong>, original <strong>music CD</strong>, and <strong>2018 daily compassionate action calendar</strong> - all products developed through the stories we capture.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We know there are many people looking for funds for their valuable special projects. We know that getting people to write checks for social justice issues is easy for some and hard for others. We know that often people don't realize the financial cost to producing meaningful, quality products - especially those relying on the hard work of artists, writers, musicians, filmmakers, and media professionals.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">We will address these challenges by providing high quality content that people feel good about supporting, using, and sharing - <i>content they can use in their own daily lives.</i> We will listen to what our contributors are most interested in, and keep them  in the loop of our activities and progress. </span></p>
<div>Homelessness is getting a lot of media attention, and the time is ripe for breaking through old thinking to co-create new solutions. Let's find a more effective way to take care of some of our most vulnerable citizens. Let's shift the perceptions that keep us from having the mindset of <strong>""They are Us. We are Them. We are One. And we ALL need a place to call HOME""</strong>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Betty Louise and Susan M. Davis have been  on the forefront of giving ""Voice"" to people and topics considered ""edgy"" or marginal since meeting, virtually, in 2009 when they each produced and hosted their own radio shows on Internet radio networks.

Thanks to serendipity, they both relocated to Nevada County, California in 2015, and became real neighbors, in the same rural, small-town community, and able to spend time co-creating with their CoPassions, which includes StoryCatching with KVMR 89.5FM Community Radio in Nevada City, California. Both Susan and Betty Louise have their own stories about homelessness, and are committed to igniting awareness and shifting perceptions about the homeless community and promoting collaborative, compassionate solutions.

Our Team of CoCreators – the artists, themselves - are equally as important as the two Project Directors. Everyone on the team has a personal story and connection to homelessness. Some have been homeless themselves, or have family members or friends who have been homeless. For all, this connection to homelessness is the driver for their passion and artistic expression in whatever media they choose to work.
 
The money raised here will be used to produce the “A Place To Call Home” Documentary Film, Music CD,  Daily Compassionate Action Calendar, and a free live, experiential public Multi-Media Event in November at the Center For the Arts in Grass Valley, CA. Each of these products or expressions will include and integrate the work of all our participating artists.

We believe that together we can co-create a collaborative movement , powerfully communicating through Story and the Arts,  giving voice to You, Me, Them and  US.
Our vision is to co-create a model for the inclusive world in which we all wish to live.

With this model, and your help, we can make a difference for homeless people, those working with homeless people, and communities struggling with the many issues of homelessness.
 
 

What We Need & What You Get
Our vision is B I G ! We have lots to do, and it will take about $100,000 in 2017 to do it right.We've already begun, and have partnered with KVMR Community Radio in Nevada City, California. We've received the Humanities for All Quick Grant from California Humanities to seed the project. We've also applied for the Arts & Media Grant from California Arts Council, and will find out if we are a recipient at the end of June. The roots have taken hold, and we've been growing now for eight months. We need your help so A-Place-To-Call-Home can blossom and influence communities everywhere!

Perks for You - Perks for ALL of Us!
We have co-created some great perks and are excited about how they include all of our individual artists and benefit  some of our wonderful non-profit partners - the grass-roots organizations in Nevada County, California serving the homeless community.Here are a few examples:
Brendan Phillips is a musician, singer/songwriter and a social worker with Turning Point Community Programs, working with chronically homeless folks who also have mental health issues, addictions, and are cycling through our jail. Brendan is also the son of the late U.Utah Phillips, a storyteller, folksinger, and activist who cared deeply about homeless people, and was one of the founders of Hospitality House Community Shelter in Nevada County, CA. Brendan is producing the ""A-Place-To-Call-Home"" music CD, which has original music created just for this project along with some Utah favorites.
Listen here for a taste of what's to come on this CD. You can also hear Brendan in the Audio Stories on our website.

 
We have some incredibly talented fine-art photographers on our team. Twelve of their photographs will be featured on the 2018 Compassionate Action Calendar we are creating, and you will proudly hang it on your wall. Every day in 2018 will have a ""compassionate action"" noted, like ""Look into the eyes of a homeless person, and say Hello"".  By taking these simple acts of kindness and compassion toward our fellow humans, we will create a world filled with Humans Being Positively Human.

 
Franceska Alexander is a talented painter and the owner of The Alexander Gallery in Nevada City, California. Her paintings will be on display at the Center For The Arts in November, as part of the ""A Place To Call Home"" Project. Sierra Roots, one of the non-profit organizations working with the chronically homeless folks living in the woods in Nevada County, has produced beautiful card-sets with the images of four of these paintings on the fronts of the cards.  Contributors of  $1000 or more, will receive a set of these cards, and we will donate $100 to Sierra Roots, designated to the fund for purchasing property for the sustainable, supportive community of micro-homes that is their vision to build.

And, of course, YOU benefit with these thank-you Perks when you become a Human Being Positively Human by contributing.
You win, They win, WE ALL WIN!
If we don't reach our goal, the funds will go exactly where they're needed most - to our artists who are producing the documentary film, music,  photography, audio stories, fine art, and the written word.
W H Y do we want to pay our artists?
We believe our culture is defined by the Arts and Humanities. Far too often, artists are ""starving"", and yet they are creating such a valuable part of what we see and experience as ""culture"".

The Impact
We have experienced the vulnerability and fear people have about homelessness and homeless people. It is not easy, for many reasons, to see people living on the streets. It is what inspired our co-creator, Terry Worden, to write a song ""You Can See the People"", which is the theme song on our video and a download and lyric sheet, one of our Perks.
Many people feel frustrated that such a wealthy planet has people without shelter literally dying on the streets, and others just feel scared a homeless person (or someone they think is homeless) will threaten their safety. 

""A Place to Call Home"" fosters greater understanding from the stories ""caught"" and shared in the various media in which our artists work.  This results in greater connection to the humanity of us all, and translates to less fear. Through capturing and sharing fascinating stories of those involved  and connected with the homeless community, we have already experienced more compassion and generosity by the people listening to the audio segments, viewing photographs and fine art, reading the essays and stories, and listening to the original music created by our artists.By August, 2017, we will have caught, recorded, and shared 60 audio stories from homeless people, those organizations working with the homeless, concerned citizens, and officials charged with finding solutions. Photographs are being taken, stories and poetry written, artwork and music created. From this wealth of creative multi-media, we are creating the interactive and experiential event in November, using real life situations to communicate and encourage empathy.

Our Supporters, Advocates, Believers, Champions, Enthusiasts, and Angels  - the Humans Being Positively Human - who contribute to our campaign, will know they are part of creating avenues for solutions to the far-reaching and multi-faceted problem of homelessness in our world - and that they are supporting the Arts and Humanities; a real W I N - W I N - W I N.
They will be helping us produce the documentary film, original music CD, and 2018 daily compassionate action calendar - all products developed through the stories we capture. We envision these products being used to shift perceptions and help homelessness here in Nevada County, California,  and to co-create a collaborative movement throughout the world.
What if we knew what to DO to co-create an inclusive world that worked for ALL???

Risks & Challenges
We know there are many people looking for funds for their valuable special projects. We know that getting people to write checks for social justice issues is easy for some and hard for others. We know that often people don't realize the financial cost to producing meaningful, quality products - especially those relying on the hard work of artists, writers, musicians, filmmakers, and media professionals.
We will address these challenges by providing high quality content that people feel good about supporting, using, and sharing - content they can use in their own daily lives. We will listen to what our contributors are most interested in, and keep them  in the loop of our activities and progress. 
Homelessness is getting a lot of media attention, and the time is ripe for breaking through old thinking to co-create new solutions. Let's find a more effective way to take care of some of our most vulnerable citizens. Let's shift the perceptions that keep us from having the mindset of ""They are Us. We are Them. We are One. And we ALL need a place to call HOME""

 
""A society will be judged on the basis of how it treats its weakest members""

<h3>A Season Full of DGR Action</h3>
<p>Deep Green Resistance is a movement to save the planet and fight injustice, and we are recruiting. We are hitting the road in June all around the world, attending action camps, participating in direct action, touring with educational presentations, and mobilizing the resistance.</p>
<p>Every resistance movement needs two things to be successful: loyalty and material support. To get that material support - food, shelter, transportation - we need YOUR help. Every donation goes directly to funding the resistance. Our work is 100% volunteer run and we are not some corrupt NGO. We are the grassroots and we work with the people for justice.</p>
Will you help us? Every donation gets us closer to making this summer season the biggest in our short history - and moves us closer towards the goal of a flourishing, living world.</div>
<div>
<h3>Upcoming Actions:</h3>
<p>We have a lot coming up, and we need your support to make it all happen. This summer, DGR members will be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Participating in actions against the Keystone XL pipeline</li>
<li>Organizing with the Lakota people against liquid genocide in White Clay</li>
<li>Fighting the first Tar Sands project in the USA in eastern Utah</li>
<li>Hosting regional organizing conferences in Cascadia and the Northeast USA</li>
<li>Touring the Northeast US and SE Canada to share the DGR message</li>
<li>Working to show solidarity with the Winnemum Wintu Tribe to protect their sacred ceremonies</li>
<li>Attending solidarity actions in Detroit, Wisconsin, Minnesota &amp; North Carolina</li>
<li>Training the next generation of resistors at a training camp in South Dakota</li>
</ul>
To make all of this happen, we need money for food, travel costs, lodging, supplies, and more. Help us make our goal and share this campaign with your friends!</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
Our goal is to have a material impact on injustice. We work to fight oppression and end the destruction of Mother Earth. It is our belief that we must do the right thing, we must not compromise, and we must work hard.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We are not afraid to go to jail, to put our lives on the line, to fight and bleed and die for liberation. Come stand with us. We need your help!</div>

<p>The initiator of the symposium, and the founder of the Freedom For North Korean Refugees of Minnesota organization is Hyon Kim, a Twin Cities entrepreneur whose interest in North Korean refugees comes out of her personal life story. Like many other Korean Americans, Hyon comes from a family that was divided when Korea was divided into north and south after World War II, a condition that was supposed to be temporary but is still in place today.  This diplomatic impasse has permanently separated an estimated 100,000 families. </p>
<p> As a four-year-old, she was separated from parents and siblings in 1951, and thereafter was brought up by an aunt in South Korea.  After a youth spent trying to work to support herself and go to high school, she had a career in the South Korean army as an officer,  and in the U.S. Army as a civilian employee.  She immigrated to Minnesota at age 24. </p>
<p>Since living in Minnesota, in addition to raising two sons as a single mother, she has been an entrepreneur and owner of several businesses. She also been active in the community organizations, and has held numerous high-level leadership positions, including a term as a Regent of the University of Minnesota. </p>
<p>She has worked as a volunteer with refugees from many countries in local outreach efforts, and would like Minnesota to one day become a welcoming home for North Korean refugees as well.  When Hyon thinks of North Korean refugees, she can see her father, mother, brothers and other ordinary people.  She wants others to also be able to think of these refugees as ordinary people in need of help and a place to live.  The symposium is a first step toward that goal. </p>

<p>Many never make it across miles of Gobi Dessert, mountains, and similarly treacherous terrain for even a chance at diplomatic immunity. </p>
<p>Women and children make up to an estimated 70 percent of North Koreans seeking exile.

<h3>Freedom for North Korean refugees of Minnesota wants to change that. </h3>
<p>On October 19th, 2015 Freedom for North Korean refugees of Minnesota will be hosting a symposium that spreads awareness and understanding of the human rights issues of North Korean refugees and spark an effort to establish long overdue solutions. </p>
<p>A number of North Korean refugees are among the remarkable group of Koreans who have agreed to come and share their stories! Additionally, subject matter experts from academic, human rights, diplomacy, media social services, faith organizations, and the arts will join them to inform us on the facts and current status of this complex international issue. Together they will illuminate the realities of refugees' lives in China, giving us a vivid glimpse into the desperation people face when they have no country and no legal rights. <br/></p>

Many never make it across miles of Gobi Dessert, mountains, and similarly treacherous terrain for even a chance at diplomatic immunity. 
Women and children make up to an estimated 70 percent of North Koreans seeking exile. All are vulnerable to opportunists, most - maybe all the females among them - are forced into human trafficking, slavery, and other crimes. If caught by Chinese authorities, these refugees have no claim to diplomatic asylum. They are deported immediately to North Korea, where they often face torture or imprisonment.   

Despite all this, the world community has done little to provide these refugees resettlement. 
Freedom for North Korean refugees of Minnesota wants to change that. 
On October 19th, 2015 Freedom for North Korean refugees of Minnesota will be hosting a symposium that spreads awareness and understanding of the human rights issues of North Korean refugees and spark an effort to establish long overdue solutions. 
A number of North Korean refugees are among the remarkable group of Koreans who have agreed to come and share their stories! Additionally, subject matter experts from academic, human rights, diplomacy, media social services, faith organizations, and the arts will join them to inform us on the facts and current status of this complex international issue. Together they will illuminate the realities of refugees' lives in China, giving us a vivid glimpse into the desperation people face when they have no country and no legal rights. 


Most immediately, we are in need of funds to support the development, promotion and launch of this much-needed program and to secure and support the costs of expert presenters and speakers. With your help, we can engage community partners in a dialogue that will go beyond this symposium and transform into meaningful outcomes in our communities.  The result will be a way to provide desperately-needed support and aid for safe and humane resettlement of North Korean refugees in Minnesota and elsewhere in the U.S.

In the video above, Yeon-Mi Park, a North Korean defector and human rights activist tells her story about escaping from North Korea in 2007 and experience on the popular South Korean show On My Way To Meet You. Once a member of the elite in Pyongyang, once her father was arrested for illegal trading, her family had to flee. Yeon-Mi first saw The Titanic in 1997, and got her first glimpse into the outside world. Later, Yeon-Mi would see a family friend executed for selling DVDs, making her realize how oppressive and horrific the North Korean government truly was. Once in China, Yeon-Mi was vulnerable to trafficking, and even saw her own mother raped in front of her. Please help others like Yeon-Mi by donating and helping us save women and children from sex trafficking and abuse. With you help we can make a difference.",2.0,1,"1 Campaign

One year later the situation for the people living in Camp Katsikas remains unchanged. Now, the camp accommodates 993 people from different parts of the world who are in a stagnant situation. Together with some of the runners who participated last year and some new runners we want to participate in the full MARATHON in Olympia to let people know we are still running – that the situation of refugees in Greece is unchanged and that the basic human right of freedom of movement is still being violated.</p><p>This year, we want to raise €3.500 to enable people from Camp Katsikas and Habibi.Works to run a full marathon on the 31st of March 2019. The money raised will cover the entire costs for participating in the run; registration fees, running gear such as shoes, shirts and shorts, transportation from and to the race, accommodation, and food.</p><p>Every cent that will be raised on top of the costs for the run, will go directly into realizing people’s projects in our maker space Habibi.Works.

In eleven different working areas, people from nearby refugee camps and locals have the possibility to get active, create, take first steps of integration and share knowledge. </p><p>In case we do not manage to fundraise the target amount, the costs will be covered for as many people as can join with the fundraised money.

It is a great way to bond with people and strive for a common goal. Furthermore, I think it is very important that the situation of refugees here in Greece is addressed. People in Europe seem to have forgotten about them, but at the same time they are still here, stuck in Greece without any freedom of movement.""KikiKiki is from Germany, Berlin. She is 27 years old. She is working in Habibi.Works and has been in Greece since February 2017. Together with Elske, she has set up a running group that runs together most mornings.

He stayed on Samos for 7 months, and has been in Katsikas for 4 months. Nabil used to exercise a lot in Syria, mainly fitness.“I like to run because it makes me fit and it makes my body looks good. I like to run the marathon because I want to challenge myself, and see if I am able to do it. I don’t have any work here, and if you do not work and you don’t do sport, you become lazy. I don’t want this. It is also nice to do sports together, that is what I like about this running group.”MortezaMorteza is from Afghanistan, Daikondi, but grew up in Iran. He is 21 years old. Before he left Iran, he graduated from High School. He left Iran in October 2017 and has been in Greece since then. Last year just before the half-marathon he injured his leg and could not join.

He lived on Samos for 5 months and has been in Katsikas for 1 year. In Iraq Qaiser worked as a truckdriver and car mechanic, he loved his job.“When I was younger I ran every day after work. Now I run every day around Katsikas. It is good for my mental well being and better then sleeping the whole day. Because of the running I have to wake up in the morning, which is good. Joining in the marathon gives me a goal to work towards to, and it is beautiful to do something together.”HusseinHusseini is from Afghanistan, Samangana. He is 24 years old. He grew up in Iran and came to Greece October 2017. He was one of the runners who participated in the half-marathon of Olympia in April 2018, as well as the 30km Lake Run in Ioannina.""I like exercising and running. It is good for my health. I am stuck in Greece and moved around from camp to camp. None of that is my choice. Participating in the run is my choice. I am choosing to run""MukhtarMukhtar is from Afghanistan, he is 24 years old. He has been in Greece for 1 year and 8 months. He first stayed in Lesvos for 7 months, and has been in Katsikas for 1 year and 1 month.“Running is important for the health and it is also fun. If you wake up and run in the morning, you will be fresh the whole day. I want to participate in the marathon because we do this as a group, which is something I like.”SamadSamad is from Afghanistan, Maydan Wardak. He is 25 years old. In Afghanistan he was a commandor in the army. He left Afghanistan in October 2017 and has been in Greece since then. Samad participated in the half-marathon last year and has been part of the running group since then.""I like to run and be healthy. It is good for my body. I will run to open peoples eyes to the fact that the 'crisis' is far from over. We are still stuck in Greece with very little hope to go anywhere else""Other Ways You Can HelpAlthough the situation of refugees in Greece is not covered by the media anymore, people are still arriving to Greece everyday, fleeing war and injustice, trying to find a safe place to live their lives. Others have been stuck in Greece for years.

<h3><strong>What our film is about</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Logline: </strong>For the first time, gay couples in Romania sue for the legal right to marry. Filmmaker Anelise Salan is among them and she films her personal and the political journey.Will  she be able to achieve her dream?</p>
<p><strong>Click on the video above to meet me and also watch a trailer from the documentary!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Synopsis</strong>: “Forbidden”is a documentary that shows gay couple life for the first time in Romania where being gay is still considered a sin or a perversion by most people. These same sex couples were the first to ever register a same sex marriage request at the local authorities, which the clerk did not approve. Now the case has gone all the way to the European Court of Human Rights while these couples wait for an answer about their future.</p>
<p>Filmmaker Anelise Salan is one of the couples. She started filming for ""Forbidden"" in early 2018 to document this historic moment for Romania and Southeastern Europe: suing Romania at the European Court of Human Rights for not having a law that protects gay families and allow same sex partnership or marriage.</p>
<p>As part of the film, Anelise also reveals her sexual orientation to the public, and in front of the camera,  and openly talks with her parents for the first time about who she is. She has their support so far but she wants to know how her parents really feel inside and how this public coming out will affect them. They will find out about her marriage plans in front of the camera. Same goes for Anelise' sister, who might have a different reaction because she is a very religious person.</p>
<p>So far, the whole team has worked AS VOLUNTEERS, and after the Coronavirus lockdown, our financial situation dropped to almost zero. We need your help to finish this movie and tell the world this very important story for human rights. It's a story about love and understanding, and we want to show that gay people are just citizens like all the rest but without a basic rights: starting a legal family is our dream and goal!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are hoping you will be willing to help us finish our film! We are looking for some funds to help finish production and post - production.</p>
<p>Right now we need 1000 euro for the whole team to travel to Anelise's hometown for filming with her family. And 1000 euro for mixing and sound design. This money will only cover the rent for the sound studio, because the sound engineering will work as a volunteer.</p>
<p>Please take a look at the rewards on the right side for your contributions. You could get your name in the credits or a digital copy of the film to watch.</p>
<p>And some exciting news! This film recently <strong>won the ""Best Discovery""</strong> award from the Balkan Documentary Center and now has the support of the state Institute for Culture in Bulgaria.We are so honoured.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In many western countries or the US, LGBT topic is not an issue anymore. But I think this story is important to remind all of us that those rights are often taken for granted. What if, for some reason some of the basic rights would disappear over night? What if you couldn't marry the person you loved?</p>
<p>To the aggressive resistance of the authorities, I won't reply with a conflict. I have never been in conflict with myself about who I am so why would I be with anyone else? Not even with the State that organized e Referendum against gay families in 2018. I want to show a film about love and couple life that might bring understanding and empathy to the Romanian society and politicians.</p>
<p>I know many teenagers had inner conflicts when they found out they are gay. And maybe a film about a 40 year old gay woman for which things were easy in life, might bring them some comfort.</p>
<p>She came out to her parents, to her teachers at school to her boss. She wasn't kicked out from home or school, she didn't lose her job, etc.</p>
<p>Parents with gay children might feel a bit relieved watching in this film my parents talking about their gay daughter with love and support.</p>

From its origins in Southern California, combining a little British heritage with modern design and philanthropy Justice 55 was born. Although still in its infancy, Justice 55's brand plans to become synonymous with wearable clothing that melds classic tailoring with an edgy yet understated aesthetic. Inspired by a desire to create quality constructed clothes, with a passion to give back, they aligned themselves with supremely skilled, local manufacturers in California. The importance of quality, expert craftsmanship and attention to detail resonated deeply, informing Justice 55's core philosophy. With a downtown sensibility and an inherent integrity – each piece is crafted from the finest materials available and approached from a form and function design standpoint – Justice 55 continuously strives for perfection, not only in its products but also with its customer service.
 
We will contact you for sizing and shirt choices at the end of the campaign.

Our t-shirts are pajama soft and cut for a classic fit. Women's Scoop neck and Mens Crew neck. Side seamed. Tagless. Preshrunk. Elegant yet comfy. Guaranteed satisfaction.

 
Justice 55 will support National Programs such as Child Help, No Kid Hungry, Generation Rescue and all local community organizations such as The Orange County Child Abuse Prevention Center, South County Outreach and TAALK. We will evaluate all and every organization to be sure they meet our standards!
Justice 55 Donates 20% of all Gross Sales to Children Related Causes. 
You are probably asking why would we do this? Well this is why!

 
The funds raised will be used to add incresed inventory and launch a couple of new lines including a denim line. 
Our first year goal is to raise $390,000 from our sales to support these causes and support them locally in your back yard. 
This could feed 78,000 hungry children in the US for a week or 1500 children for an entire year. It keeps phone lines open to those supporting abused children giving them someone they can talk to in confidence. It supports the early diagnosis and intervention of autism.
By 2018 our goal is to raise $9 million annually for these causes and we need your help to get there!
THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT!

<p><strong>Story of My Book</strong></p>
<p><i>The Mindset of a Refugee: Understanding the Human Potential of Current and Former Refugees to Change Our Planet</i> is about empowering refugees to help themselves, encouraging organizations to include refugees at the table of solution finding, and investing in refugees currently living in refugee camps, and also acknowledge the good comes from welcoming in refugees. </p>
<p><br/>My name is Joseph Minani and I am the author of The Mindset of a Refugee. I wrote this book because I lived the refugee experience in Camp Lukole, Tanzania after my family fled the great lakes region of east Africa from Burundi and Rwanda escaping a genocide.  After 12 years in the United States, there came a time when I reflected on my life as a whole and observed how far I have come and all the possibilities that lay ahead of me because my family and I were able to be resettled. I thought about the current conditions children and families are living in and their potential futures that lack options. What if I could tell that kid that it’s possible to thrive or that he or she has a potential that could change the world and themselves? What if I can convince you that these this community of people are worth supporting and these families can one day be your favorite neighbors?<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover what it means to be a refugee opposite to how the media portrays them. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for global citizenship in you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help empower you, those around you, and help others help themselves.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the power of a mindset forged in adversity. In it I tell:</p>
<p>The story of my own journey coming to the United States. </p>
<p>The story of Sandy Dang and her incredible strides from refugee to community leader. </p>
<p>The stories of hope and the unique case of perseverance found in refugees</p>
<p>You will love this book if you believe that everyone deserves a right to life, freedom, and a future enriched with endless possibilities.<br/><br/>The Mindset of a Refugee, is a non-fiction book that speaks to organizational leaders and people who stand with refugees looking for ways to support refugees effectively or work with former or current refugees for the first time.</p>
<p><strong>The Book - The Mindset of A Refugee</strong></p>The book is written in 3 Parts....<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-3. The first chapter is about the history of refugees. From the early 1800’s refugees to the present day refugees crisis. In chapter two, readers will learn about the mindset after trauma and the potential it has to uplift people when given the right support. Chapter 3 is about why we should support refugees. You’ll learn about reciprocity and how helping refugees helps all of us.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains chapters 4-6. In this section, you will learn the incredible qualities of current and former refugees. You will learn about hope, compassion, courage, and perseverance from a unique perspective while learning how we should help refugees harness the power within and better themselves to better our world.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains the last three chapters. Here, you will learn how to support refugees, how to change your perspective on refugeeness, and the importance of investing in refugee mental health. You will hear stories from mental health providers and company leaders on the importance of implementing a middle grounding where organizations and refugee leaders work hand in hand, and essentially why refugees deserve a seat at the table.<br/> <p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></p> This book will be published with New Degree Press.

Fortunately, they failed. Marissa and her family will need time to begin recovering from this arduous and traumatic experience. It’s been a long and painful journey and, though her release from jail is definitely a win -- no 60 years -- the journey of seeking ultimate freedom is not over.  Marissa will be forced to be on strict home detention while being under surveillance for two years.  This is by no means freedom in the sense we feel she deserves.  Our next agenda is to seek full restoration for Marissa and her family, including the expunging of her so-called criminal record, and a systemic transformation that prevents black women and all survivors of domestic violence from experiencing the hostile and brutal treatment from policing, prosecution, and prison systems that Marissa has endured. We will push for improved legislation and monitoring of systems that penalize victims of domestic violence who choose to save their lives by force.

<h3>(What follows is the text from the 2015 fundraiser)</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Last year's fundraiser was so successful that we're doing it again this year!<br/>
</h3>
<div>And with a twist. <b>Sons of Liberty International and Matthew VanDyke will each match all donations to this fundraiser up to $1,000 each!</b> Your donation can have triple the impact!</div>
<div>For example, if you give $50, Sons of Liberty International will give $50, and Matthew VanDyke will give $50, making your $50 donation into $150. Sons of Liberty International and Matthew VanDyke will continue matching donations until they each reach $1,000 donated, meaning that the first $1,000 donated this year by the public will result in $3,000 total being donated!</div>
<div>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>In 2014, this fundraiser helped purchase 2,000 Christmas presents for 1,500 Assyrian Iraqi Christian children in the Nineveh Plain region of Iraq.</h3>

<h3>This year, we're doing it again. </h3>
<h3><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px;"">This has been a very difficult year for many of Iraq's Christian children, having become refugees in their own country after losing their homes to ISIS last year.</span></h3>
<h3>Help us give them a Christmas they'll never forget, and that will bring them some happiness this holiday season.</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>The details:</b></p>
<p><b>-Last year's fundraiser has raised $17,392 as of 11/17/2015, and was turned into an IndieGoGo InDemand campaign to allow it to continue each year. That means the starting point for this year's fundraiser is $17,392.</b></p>
<p><b>- Sons of Liberty International and Matthew VanDyke are each matching all donations until $1,000 has been donated by the public (at which time $1,000 will have been donated by Sons of Liberty International and $1,000 will have been donated by Matthew VanDyke, making the total raised $1,000+$1,000+$1,000=$3,000 (which will show as $20,392 on this InDemand fundraiser).</b></p>
<p><b>- Sons of Liberty International and Matthew VanDyke will each match the first $1,000 in donations (these will be matched to the total outside of IndieGoGo so that more funds go towards the cause and less towards credit card and other fees)</b></p>
<p><b>- 100% of the funds will go towards helping Christians in Iraq. None of the funds will be used for overhead, travel, etc.</b></p>
<p><b>- Most of the funds will be used for Christmas presents for Assyrian Iraqi Christian children. We are saying most instead of all because last year the Assyrian Iraqi Christian activists we worked with in Iraq, in the spirit of Christmas, wanted to help 6 Yazidi families who needed assistance, so some of the funds were used to purchase enough food supplies to feed the families for months. We anticipate that in the spirit of giving, a similar initiative by Assyrian Iraqi Christian activists might be undertaken, or that an emergency in Iraq could require some funds to be used to address a critical need of the Assyrian Iraqi Christian refugees.</b></p>
<br/><p></p>
<div>
<p><b>2014 fundraiser:</b></p>
<p><b>Last year's fundraiser was an incredible success, raising over $12,000 during the regular IndieGoGo fundraiser and thousands of dollars more as an IndieGoGo InDemand campaign afterwards, reaching a total of $17,392 as of 11/17/2015 when the fundraiser for Christmas 2015 was launched.</b></p>
<p><b>Your donated funds made an incredible impact for the Christians of Iraq:</b></p>
<p><b>- Helped purchase 2,000 Christmas presents for 1,500 Assyrian Iraqi Christian children</b></p>
<p><b>- Helped purchase enough food to feed 6 impoverished Yazidi families for months</b></p>
<p><b>- Purchased a video projector for Iraqi Christian children and families to watch videos and movies together</b></p>

<p><b>About Assyrian Iraqi Christians: The Assyrian people of Iraq are the original inhabitants of the country, with northern Iraq as their ancestral homeland dating back over 4,000 years. The Assyrians converted to Christianity in the early days of the faith, and their churches and holy sites are among the oldest in Christianity. They speak a modern version of Aramaic, the same language as Jesus. Assyrians have been persecuted in Iraq for years and many have fled, with the population going from 1.2 million Assyrians in Iraq in 2003 to approximately 300,000 before ISIS attacked. Over 100,000 have lost their homes and lands to ISIS and many now live as refugees (internally displaced persons) in their own country, hoping to one day return to their homes.</b></p>
<p><b>About Sons of Liberty International: Sons of Liberty International (SOLI) is an organization that provides free advising, training, and supplies to forces fighting against ISIS. In 2014-2015 SOLI trained over 300 Assyrian Iraqi Christians to fight against ISIS and will expand operations in the coming months.

<br/><h3>In June there were 30,000 Christians in Mosul, Iraq. Today, there are 0.<br/>
</h3>
<p>Given an ultimatum by the insurgent group ISIS to convert or die, one of the oldest Christian communities in the world has been wiped out as they were forced to flee, some with only the clothes they were wearing.</p>
<p>Women even had <a href=""http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/07/22/isis-robs-christians-fleeing-its-edict-in-mosul-convert-leave-or-die.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">crucifixes torn from their necks</a> as they fled.</p>
<p>My name is <a href=""http://www.matthewvandyke.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Matthew VanDyke</a>. I am an American filmmaker, international security analyst, and combat veteran of the 2011 Libyan Revolution known for my documentary films <a href=""http://www.syrianrevolutionfilm.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Not Anymore: A Story of Revolution</i></a> about the war in Syria and <a href=""http://www.matthewvandyke.com/films/point-and-shoot/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Point and Shoot</i></a> about my experiences fighting in <a href=""http://www.matthewvandyke.com/about.html#freedom-fighter"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Libya</a>.</p>
<p>I lived in Iraq for much of 2008-2010, during some of the period covered in <i>Point and Shoot</i>. During this time I worked as an English teacher, war correspondent, documentary filmmaker, and in the import business. I explored various parts of Iraq by motorcycle during those years, getting to know many Iraqis from a wide variety of backgrounds and regions of the country.<br/></p>
<p>In 2014 I will return to Iraq and oversee the delivery of aid to Iraqi Christians who have been forced from their homes by ISIS (the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, also known as ISIL or IS). ISIS is an insurgent group that broke away from Al Qaeda in 2014 and has waged a campaign of extreme brutality against both Syrians and Iraqis. In addition, the group is responsible for the kidnappings of several international journalists, including personal friends of mine.</p>
<p>These are all innocents who have had their lives destroyed by the militant radicals of ISIS, many of whom are not even from Syria and Iraq but instead foreign radicals who have come to impose their will on a terrified population.</p>
<p>Mosul, Iraq is home to one of the oldest Christian communities in the world, dating back to the first few centuries of the religion. In June, 2014 ISIS invaded Mosul, capturing the city and making it the capital of their declared Islamic State.</p>
<p>Much as Jews were forced to wear the Star of David by Nazis during the holocaust, ISIS began painting the letter ""N"" for ""Nasrani” or Nazarene (Christian in Arabic) on the homes of Christians.</p>
<p>In July, 2014 ISIS ordered all Christians to convert to Islam or be killed. A few converted to protect their families, but most fled the city.</p>
<p>As they fled, many were robbed of everything they had taken with them at the ISIS checkpoints around the city, leaving them with just the clothes on their backs. The homes and businesses they had left behind were looted and seized.</p>
<p>They have lost everything.</p>
<p><b>The goal is to raise $12,000, a figure symbolically chosen because of its significance in Christianity (12 disciples, 12 tribes of Israel, and more).</b></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Is Needed &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>100% OF THE FUNDS RAISED WILL GO TO HELP CHRISTIANS IN IRAQ.</b></p>
<p><b>I will not be using -any- of the funds for my travel or other expenses while delivering this aid.</b></p>
<p>All of the funds raised through IndieGoGo will benefit Christians in Iraq, with approximately 90% used for direct aid and projects on the ground and no more than 10% for increasing awareness of the issue and promoting the fundraiser to raise more money for the cause.</p>
<p>The funds you donate won't be lost to travel and overhead expenses like with so many fundraisers and charitable organizations that can spend as much as 30% or more on such expenses.</p>
<p>This is a unique opportunity to <i>be part of a desperately needed relief effort</i> that will be directly managed by someone with extensive experience and contacts in Iraq and the region. You can have complete confidence that your donations will go directly to purchasing and distributing aid, as I will personally oversee this process in Iraq. I will be there to ensure that your donations are used properly, effectively, and ethically.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: 30px; letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;"">The Impact</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); line-height: 30px; letter-spacing: 0px; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;""></span></p>
<p>The funds will ideally be used to implement as many long-lasting, sustainable aid projects as possible, dependent on the amount raised and the situation encountered on the ground. These may include such possibilities as new water wells (ISIS has cut off water to some of the Christian villages around Mosul), constructing a community bakery for refugee families, helping Christian shopkeepers who lost everything reopen in their place of resettlement, or funding the expansion of churches to accommodate the Christian refugees. Funds may also be used for more immediate relief, including the purchase of materials for schoolchildren, clothing and other necessities for displaced families and individuals, and toys for refugee children.</p>
<p>The needs of the Christian refugees are substantial. The only reason for not stating a specific project for the funds at this time is that far too often people are helped in ways that aren't needed (sending cargo containers of clothes when another organization has already provided them with enough) or even in ways that are detrimental (when that donated clothing upsets the local economy and causes tailors to close shop).</p>
<p>Therefore, in the best interest of those being helped, the funds will be committed to projects once I am on the ground in Iraq and able to personally assess, with the help of my extensive network of contacts, what is needed and determine the most effective way to implement the projects.</p>
<p>I have years of experience in Iraq, particularly in this northern region of the country around Mosul (and some experience inside Mosul as well). I have the people on the ground who can do this the right way and help ensure that the money goes where it is needed. I will provide photographs and hopefully some video as well of how your donations were used so you can see the impact your contributions have made on specific individuals whose lives you can help change forever.</p>
<p></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>This is a low-risk fundraiser for donors because I'm putting my name and reputation on the line in this effort and as a public figure am easily held accountable for the outcome.</p>
<p>For me it is high-risk as I will face the threat of being kidnapped or killed by ISIS. I am well-known to ISIS because of my military service in Libya and various work I have done for the revolution in Syria over the years. My status as a former combatant in Libya and a current activist and adviser in Syria has dramatically increased the risks I face when working in the region in general, but particularly in countries like Iraq where ISIS has a strong presence.</p>
<p>Regardless of the challenges, I will not be deterred from this mission. The expulsion of Christians from Mosul, Iraq represents a grave injustice that has not only horrified Christians like myself, but also most Muslims around the world because this treatment of Christians violates their faith as well.</p>
<p>The Christians of Mosul are truly suffering innocents and I call on people of all faiths to support this fundraiser to provide the relief that they desperately need.</p>

(What follows is the text from the 2015 fundraiser)

Last year's fundraiser was so successful that we're doing it again this year!

And with a twist. Sons of Liberty International and Matthew VanDyke will each match all donations to this fundraiser up to $1,000 each! Your donation can have triple the impact!
For example, if you give $50, Sons of Liberty International will give $50, and Matthew VanDyke will give $50, making your $50 donation into $150. Sons of Liberty International and Matthew VanDyke will continue matching donations until they each reach $1,000 donated, meaning that the first $1,000 donated this year by the public will result in $3,000 total being donated!


In 2014, this fundraiser helped purchase 2,000 Christmas presents for 1,500 Assyrian Iraqi Christian children in the Nineveh Plain region of Iraq.



This year, we're doing it again. 
This has been a very difficult year for many of Iraq's Christian children, having become refugees in their own country after losing their homes to ISIS last year.
Help us give them a Christmas they'll never forget, and that will bring them some happiness this holiday season.


The details:
-Last year's fundraiser has raised $17,392 as of 11/17/2015, and was turned into an IndieGoGo InDemand campaign to allow it to continue each year. That means the starting point for this year's fundraiser is $17,392.
- Sons of Liberty International and Matthew VanDyke are each matching all donations until $1,000 has been donated by the public (at which time $1,000 will have been donated by Sons of Liberty International and $1,000 will have been donated by Matthew VanDyke, making the total raised $1,000+$1,000+$1,000=$3,000 (which will show as $20,392 on this InDemand fundraiser).
- Sons of Liberty International and Matthew VanDyke will each match the first $1,000 in donations (these will be matched to the total outside of IndieGoGo so that more funds go towards the cause and less towards credit card and other fees)
- 100% of the funds will go towards helping Christians in Iraq. None of the funds will be used for overhead, travel, etc.
- Most of the funds will be used for Christmas presents for Assyrian Iraqi Christian children. We are saying most instead of all because last year the Assyrian Iraqi Christian activists we worked with in Iraq, in the spirit of Christmas, wanted to help 6 Yazidi families who needed assistance, so some of the funds were used to purchase enough food supplies to feed the families for months. We anticipate that in the spirit of giving, a similar initiative by Assyrian Iraqi Christian activists might be undertaken, or that an emergency in Iraq could require some funds to be used to address a critical need of the Assyrian Iraqi Christian refugees.


2014 fundraiser:
Last year's fundraiser was an incredible success, raising over $12,000 during the regular IndieGoGo fundraiser and thousands of dollars more as an IndieGoGo InDemand campaign afterwards, reaching a total of $17,392 as of 11/17/2015 when the fundraiser for Christmas 2015 was launched.
Your donated funds made an incredible impact for the Christians of Iraq:
- Helped purchase 2,000 Christmas presents for 1,500 Assyrian Iraqi Christian children
- Helped purchase enough food to feed 6 impoverished Yazidi families for months
- Purchased a video projector for Iraqi Christian children and families to watch videos and movies together

Please give generously this year and we'll help make Christmas 2015 a time of joy and happiness for children who are innocent victims of ISIS.

About Assyrian Iraqi Christians: The Assyrian people of Iraq are the original inhabitants of the country, with northern Iraq as their ancestral homeland dating back over 4,000 years. The Assyrians converted to Christianity in the early days of the faith, and their churches and holy sites are among the oldest in Christianity. They speak a modern version of Aramaic, the same language as Jesus. Assyrians have been persecuted in Iraq for years and many have fled, with the population going from 1.2 million Assyrians in Iraq in 2003 to approximately 300,000 before ISIS attacked. Over 100,000 have lost their homes and lands to ISIS and many now live as refugees (internally displaced persons) in their own country, hoping to one day return to their homes.
About Sons of Liberty International: Sons of Liberty International (SOLI) is an organization that provides free advising, training, and supplies to forces fighting against ISIS. In 2014-2015 SOLI trained over 300 Assyrian Iraqi Christians to fight against ISIS and will expand operations in the coming months. Visit www.sonsoflibertyinternational.com to learn more.
About Matthew VanDyke: Matthew VanDyke is an international security analyst, former filmmaker, and founder of Sons of Liberty International. He appears regularly in the media as an analyst/commentator, including on FOX News and MSNBC. Visit www.matthewvandyke.com to learn more.

(What follows is the text from the 2014 fundraiser)
In June there were 30,000 Christians in Mosul, Iraq. Today, there are 0.

Given an ultimatum by the insurgent group ISIS to convert or die, one of the oldest Christian communities in the world has been wiped out as they were forced to flee, some with only the clothes they were wearing.
Women even had crucifixes torn from their necks as they fled.
My name is Matthew VanDyke. I am an American filmmaker, international security analyst, and combat veteran of the 2011 Libyan Revolution known for my documentary films Not Anymore: A Story of Revolution about the war in Syria and Point and Shoot about my experiences fighting in Libya.
I lived in Iraq for much of 2008-2010, during some of the period covered in Point and Shoot. During this time I worked as an English teacher, war correspondent, documentary filmmaker, and in the import business. I explored various parts of Iraq by motorcycle during those years, getting to know many Iraqis from a wide variety of backgrounds and regions of the country.
In 2014 I will return to Iraq and oversee the delivery of aid to Iraqi Christians who have been forced from their homes by ISIS (the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, also known as ISIL or IS). ISIS is an insurgent group that broke away from Al Qaeda in 2014 and has waged a campaign of extreme brutality against both Syrians and Iraqis. In addition, the group is responsible for the kidnappings of several international journalists, including personal friends of mine.
These are all innocents who have had their lives destroyed by the militant radicals of ISIS, many of whom are not even from Syria and Iraq but instead foreign radicals who have come to impose their will on a terrified population.
Mosul, Iraq is home to one of the oldest Christian communities in the world, dating back to the first few centuries of the religion. In June, 2014 ISIS invaded Mosul, capturing the city and making it the capital of their declared Islamic State.
Much as Jews were forced to wear the Star of David by Nazis during the holocaust, ISIS began painting the letter ""N"" for ""Nasrani” or Nazarene (Christian in Arabic) on the homes of Christians.
In July, 2014 ISIS ordered all Christians to convert to Islam or be killed. A few converted to protect their families, but most fled the city.
As they fled, many were robbed of everything they had taken with them at the ISIS checkpoints around the city, leaving them with just the clothes on their backs. The homes and businesses they had left behind were looted and seized.
They have lost everything.
The goal is to raise $12,000, a figure symbolically chosen because of its significance in Christianity (12 disciples, 12 tribes of Israel, and more).


What Is Needed & What You Get

100% OF THE FUNDS RAISED WILL GO TO HELP CHRISTIANS IN IRAQ.
I will not be using -any- of the funds for my travel or other expenses while delivering this aid.
All of the funds raised through IndieGoGo will benefit Christians in Iraq, with approximately 90% used for direct aid and projects on the ground and no more than 10% for increasing awareness of the issue and promoting the fundraiser to raise more money for the cause.
The funds you donate won't be lost to travel and overhead expenses like with so many fundraisers and charitable organizations that can spend as much as 30% or more on such expenses.
This is a unique opportunity to be part of a desperately needed relief effort that will be directly managed by someone with extensive experience and contacts in Iraq and the region. You can have complete confidence that your donations will go directly to purchasing and distributing aid, as I will personally oversee this process in Iraq. I will be there to ensure that your donations are used properly, effectively, and ethically.
The Impact

The funds will ideally be used to implement as many long-lasting, sustainable aid projects as possible, dependent on the amount raised and the situation encountered on the ground. These may include such possibilities as new water wells (ISIS has cut off water to some of the Christian villages around Mosul), constructing a community bakery for refugee families, helping Christian shopkeepers who lost everything reopen in their place of resettlement, or funding the expansion of churches to accommodate the Christian refugees. Funds may also be used for more immediate relief, including the purchase of materials for schoolchildren, clothing and other necessities for displaced families and individuals, and toys for refugee children.
The needs of the Christian refugees are substantial. The only reason for not stating a specific project for the funds at this time is that far too often people are helped in ways that aren't needed (sending cargo containers of clothes when another organization has already provided them with enough) or even in ways that are detrimental (when that donated clothing upsets the local economy and causes tailors to close shop).
Therefore, in the best interest of those being helped, the funds will be committed to projects once I am on the ground in Iraq and able to personally assess, with the help of my extensive network of contacts, what is needed and determine the most effective way to implement the projects.
I have years of experience in Iraq, particularly in this northern region of the country around Mosul (and some experience inside Mosul as well). I have the people on the ground who can do this the right way and help ensure that the money goes where it is needed. I will provide photographs and hopefully some video as well of how your donations were used so you can see the impact your contributions have made on specific individuals whose lives you can help change forever.

  Risks & Challenges This is a low-risk fundraiser for donors because I'm putting my name and reputation on the line in this effort and as a public figure am easily held accountable for the outcome.
For me it is high-risk as I will face the threat of being kidnapped or killed by ISIS. I am well-known to ISIS because of my military service in Libya and various work I have done for the revolution in Syria over the years. My status as a former combatant in Libya and a current activist and adviser in Syria has dramatically increased the risks I face when working in the region in general, but particularly in countries like Iraq where ISIS has a strong presence.
Regardless of the challenges, I will not be deterred from this mission. The expulsion of Christians from Mosul, Iraq represents a grave injustice that has not only horrified Christians like myself, but also most Muslims around the world because this treatment of Christians violates their faith as well.
The Christians of Mosul are truly suffering innocents and I call on people of all faiths to support this fundraiser to provide the relief that they desperately need.

  Other Ways You Can Help I hope that in addition to making a contribution to this fundraiser that you will take a few moments to promote it through social media (Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, Reddit, etc.) using the Indiegogo share tools or other methods.
Donations collected from churches and community organizations are also welcome, and of course please speak about and promote this fundraiser at your own worship services and events.
