<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>The Little Catering Co. Brisbane started as a little personal project to spend more time doing the things I love. From there it has blossomed into something more and I would like you to help me get it there!</p>
<p>I've been a cook for over 15 years and for the last decade as a Food Studies and Hospitality teacher I have been lucky enough to teach a LOT of teenagers how to cook and have mentored many to become passionate about food and the hospitality industry.</p>
<p>This little brainchild I hope will one day come into its physical form and turn into a cafe and catering school - supporting local the local community by sourcing local and seasonal produce, providing apprenticeships, employment, as well as a place where locals can convene and where artists can show their wares.</p>
<p>Though, for now - one must start small - with cakes and mobile catering!</p>

<h3>What is 8-Bit Retro?</h3>
<p>8-Bit Retro will be Concord's first Arcade Bar. I plan to feature amazing food, great brews (domestic, imported, and craft) on tap and classic arcade games.</p>
<p>I started working on this idea a little under a year ago, and now feel I am ready to make this happen. I have a really great team of talented people helping, but to get us over the hump I need the help of Concord!</p>
<p>Many of us have been gaming lovers since before we can remember. For my team and I, this will be a dream come true and the greatest job we could possibly hope for. For Concord, this will be a fun and interactive bar where you can play classic arcade games, try the latest in local craft beers (along with domestic and imported) along with weekly promotions like trivia, tournaments and so much more!!</p>
<p>We think Concord needs more locally owned and unique places like 8 Bit, with your donations, we can make this a reality! The idea of doing this grassroots style is we wanted the bar to be a part of the community; to work with as many local businesses, friends, artists and groups as we can to really make 8-Bit a place that feels like home.We  all live here and we love this city. 8-Bit will be our contribution to the city that we love.</p>
<p>What We Need &amp; What You Get</p>
</div><div>
<p>I've got a few games and I'm continuing to hunt down more. What we need from you is some extra funding so that we can pay for the other necessities of opening a bar. We need a space, a bar, tables, chairs, bathrooms, coolers, and initial inventory (you know, the beer!)</p>
<p>With your help, Concord can have a unique place to go that is different from any other night club or bar than what we currently have. Let's get these games into a place where everyone (over 21, sorry) can come and play them!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Concord is trying to grow and is developing into a better city every day and 8-Bit wants to be a part of this growth; I also want to help develop a market I feel needs improving. The Arcade. </p>
<p>Arcades are getting harder and harder to find, the classics have basically disappeared from the public eye. Today, most of them are either collecting dust in warehouses or in the basements of collectors' homes, with your help we can bring these (lost treasures) (golden relics) (hidden treasures) back into the limelight for Concord and the surrounding communities to enjoy.</p>
<p>Putting them in a bar is really a no-brainer. After all, arcade games have been found in bars since their conception. We want to provide that experience for people again.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Of course, owning and operating a bar is a risky business venture. I have been around the city and in other cities talking with bar owners, arcade bar owners, small business owners and anyone else who I thought could give me some insight. I'm confident that my team and I have what it takes to run a successful bar.</p>
<p>I think our number one challenge will be keeping these classic machines in working order. For this reason, I have created a network of expert gaming techs who know the insides and outs of these beloved machines. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Low on Funds? That's OK! </h3>
<p>It really is ok! Any contribution will do. Also, helping us get the word helps us in a major way. The more people that know about this project, the better. Just telling your friends helps us get closer to achieving our goals. Every dollar counts, every contribution helps, and we truly appreciate any help you can throw our way! We will be stretching our dollars as far as we can to make this a reality. With your help, we can do this!</p>

<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>Every Crowdfunding campaign has its risks and challenges.</p>
<p>Sonic Foamer production has already started. A portion of the money we raise here will go to fund the production of more Sonic foamers.  Another portion of our funding will be used to grow our Sonic Foamer team to meet production demands.</p>
<p>Another challenge and part of funding will be used in getting the word out through social media, Bloggers, and retailers. We have worked hard over the last year to reach Beer advocates and key bloggers to get their feedback which has been incredible so far. We want to continue building these relationships and plan accordingly. We expect to hit all of our delivery deadlines.</p>
<p>Initial Goals: <br/>1.<strong>AWARENESS</strong> - Increase visibility and awareness for the Sonic Foamer online. <br/>2.<strong>ACTION</strong> – Engage, excite and drive beer enthusiasts to the product website for more information and purchase. <br/>3.<strong>ADVOCACY</strong> - Generate online press and influential users to talk about the Sonic Foamer.</p>
<p><strong>FAQ:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why do I want a head on my beer?</strong></p>
<p>Beer foam is important for two reasons. First, the bubbles popping is what releases the aroma of the beer. What you smell is a large part of what you taste when you consume anything including beer. The second reason is the foam creates a barrier that keeps the beer from oxygen. Once the beer is exposed to oxygen, it allows the active yeasts and other living organisms to grow and literally eat your beer. This will reduce the taste and flavor.</p>
<p><strong>Does it work on all types of Beer?</strong></p>
<p>The SF works on any beer that you can pour and has a normal frothy head. It does not create a head on a beer that does not normally have a head or if it has a Champagne type head (Example: Barley Wine, Lambic etc.)</p>
<p><strong>Does it work with any glass?</strong></p>
<p>No, it works best with a pub type glass with a flat bottom that is not thick. The glass should also not be stemmed. The base of the glass must fit flat with full contact to the activation tray.</p>
<h3>Does the beer Temperature matter?</h3>
<p>There are correct temperatures to serve every kind of beer. These temperatures are available on line from many sites. If you serve a beer too cold, the gases will contract and there will be less foam. If the beer is served too warm, the gases will expand and too much foam will be produced.</p>
<p><strong>Will the SF flatten my beer?</strong></p>
<p>The SF is designed to manage the foam on your beer. It should only be used when you need more foam. There is a limited amount of gases in any beer. If you activate the gases too many times, ultimately the beer will go flat. Usually, you should not use the SF more than two or three times for any one beer.</p>
<p><strong>Why do I put water in the tray?</strong></p>
<p>The SF uses finely calibrated, ultrasonic sound waves to create beer foam. It is a safe sound that humans cannot hear. All sound is a vibration. By putting water in the tray, it contains the sound waves or vibrations and directs them into the glass. Without the water, the SF will not work.</p>
<p><strong>What is the light for?</strong></p>
<p>The light is mostly fun and decorative. It does however change to a white light when the tray is activated. The second button to the left on top of the unit allows you to change the primary blinking color to different colors.</p>
<p><strong>Should I test the SF before pouring a full glass?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, always test each beer you plan to use the SF on. This will allow you to see the reaction of that specific beer. Brewers are putting a lot of new ingredients into beers. Some of them have additives like wheat that naturally promotes more foam. They will have a bigger reaction. We suggest that you pour about two fingers of beer in the glass to test before pouring a full beer. Note: Look up a two finger shot, if you don’t know what that means.</p>
<p><strong>Should I pour to the top of the glass?</strong></p>
<p>Never. Always leave room for the aroma. It is strange that everyone has been taught how to pour a nice glass of wine. You know to not pour to the top to leave room for the aroma. It is the same for a good beer.</p>
<p><strong>Why doesn't my SF work?</strong></p>
<p>Here are possible reasons: <br/>· No batteries <br/>· No water in the tray <br/>· Wrong type of beer that does not foam normally. <br/>· Wrong type of glass that is either too thick at the base or does not contact the tray (like a stemmed glass). <br/>· Your beer is too cold</p>

The fact that you can and will get your fresh pair of J`s dirty. Whether it be someone accidently stepping on them while riding on the subway and even riding in crowded buses. Along with everyday wear and tear, whether you`re pounding the pavement in the city or jogging in the burbs. The beating your shoes take is an unfortunate but inevitable occurrence. But it can be a manageable occurrence.</p>
<p>With the aforementioned events occurring throughout everyday life. Black Rose Corp wants to provide a service that will help people not have to break the bank in those situations by spending money they don’t necessarily have. Especially if those shoes consist of any Yeezy boosts, Jordans, and even Addidas ultra boosts. By contributing to the campaign. You can help create a service that can help everyday people manage the ever changing world and ever more expensive world of athleisure fashion. Let’s face it, nothing is getting cheaper. And being able to hold onto your 1 or 2 pairs of high end sneakers just that much longer. Can definitely help you the reader and others keep more money in your pockets.</p>
<p>I`m sure you want to know how much funding will be needed to achieve greatness. $5,000.00 at the very least is what will be needed in contributions. This will go to helping Black Rose Corp getting fully incorporated. Buying much needed and more supplies. What kind of supplies you`re wondering? Well paints and dye`s that will be used for custom and refurbishing work, from known and trusted companies like Angelus direct. Airbrush kit that will also be used for custom work.

<p>Even if you are unable to contribute monetarily at the moment. Getting the word out can be just as valuable a resource. Word of mouth is an intangible gold that must not be taken for granted.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Howdy!  My name is Raven and I created the cleaning products lovingly referred to as Pyoure.  I am a lawyer by trade, but please don't hold that against me.  By the time I saw the light, I was already $100k in student loan debt and figured I might as well have a go at salvaging my degree.  </p>
<p>I started Pyoure, not because I liked to clean, but because I hated it.  I hated the time it took out of my day, and I especially hated the guilt I felt as I sprayed the toxic solutions throughout my house.    Funny enough, I equally detest it when things around me are dirty.  You can imagine my torture.  </p>
<p>To ease my cleaning pain, I began to search for something that would make my own cleaning routine green, enjoyable, and go a lot faster.  The cleaning products that are on the market today just suck.  They're full of toxic chemicals that poison our families and waterways, the packaging is excessive, and they smell boring.  The only other alternative to these problems was to make your own green cleaning products.  The DIY recipes on the internet were green, but they didn't clean worth crap, and I couldn't trust the end product on the really tough jobs like when a family member got sick.</p>
<p>So I started to tinker (and I looooove to tinker), and ended up creating a concentrated product that combined hydrogen peroxide with organic detergents and beautiful fragrances.  I chose hydrogen peroxide because it is as effective at killing household germs as bleach, but it safely breaks down into oxygen and water when it's finished.  </p>
<p>I started using this new creation in my own home for everyday cleaning in addition to the occasional bout of diarrhea and vomiting that my two beautiful children would bestow upon me.  Surprisingly, sicknesses in my household didn't spread!  I also gave some away to my friends and neighbors who loved it and encouraged me to sell them online.  </p>
<p>This past January 2016 I opened an online store and we started selling Pyoure products to the masses!  Our customers love Pyoure and have consistently given it 5 star ratings across the board (and let me just say that we have the most loyal, encouraging, and all-around amazing customers on the planet).  Our customers have repeatedly raved about how Pyoure has drastically improved their cleaning routines because it cleans so well and smells so good.   (I highly recommend you check out our website and read the product reviews for yourself at <a href=""http://bit.ly/pyourecleaningindiegogostory"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.PyoureCleaning.com</a>.  None of the reviews were paid for or compensated in any way.)</p>
<h2><strong>Here's what makes Pyoure extra special:</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Our cleaning products contain <strong>zero toxic ingredients.</strong>
</li>
<li>Pyoure uses <strong>hydrogen peroxide</strong> to safely kill germs without harming our waterways.</li>
<li>Pyoure <strong>takes the guess work out</strong> of environmentally friendly, non-toxic cleaning.</li>
<li>We offer the <strong>largest variety of unique non-toxic scents</strong> that freshen your space for hours.</li>
<li>We are constantly innovating and have created an <strong>exclusive line of products</strong>:<ul>
<li>sprayable hydrogen peroxide cleaning gel</li>
<li>designer reusable glass spray bottles that not only offer UV light protection, but are guaranteed to not chip or fade</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Our <strong>soaps are organic</strong> and <strong>ultra concentrated.</strong>
</li>
<li>Our <strong>skin-safe fragrances</strong> are beautifully <b>complex,</b> and are the same <strong>premium grade</strong> as those used in perfumes and body sprays.</li>
<li>Most of our finished products are <strong>concentrated.  </strong>This saves valuable cabinet space and allows the user to customize the strength of the cleaner based on their needs.</li>
<li>Pyoure <strong>reduces waste</strong> by using minimal packaging that is <strong>100% recyclable.</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>What We Need</h2>
<p>Pyoure products are wonderful, but we want to make them even better by doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Expanding our product line by adding specialized products for toilets, grout, carpet, and laundry</li>
<li>Adding biodegradable hydrogen peroxide wipes</li>
<li>Adding more premium custom fragrances that are cosmetic grade and phthalate free</li>
<li>Reducing our packaging even further by adding bigger and more concentrated quantities, and exploring additional biodegradable options</li>
<li>Improving our bottle filling equipment to stream-line the process</li>
<li>Improving our administrative tools such as label printers, software, computers, camera, shelves, and carts</li>
</ul>
<p>Folks, all of this costs a LOT of money, but your funding will help us get there! </p>
</div><div>
<h2>What You Get</h2>
<p>Ahhh.  Finally the good part!  If you invest your money with Pyoure, in return you will get some really awesome cleaning products.  Since you're going to needs cleaning products in the near future anyways, this is a pretty sweet deal!  Just one 8-ounce Concentrate will last approximately 2 to 3 weeks.  But beware, once you start using our products, you won't want to use any other cleaning product again.  </p>
<p>You will also<strong> receive a discount that you can use an unlimited amount of times, for the entire year of 2017, on absolutely anything on our website</strong>.   This is huge because we use discounts SPARINGLY.  And when I say sparingly, I mean almost never, and certainly not to this magnitude.   The only thing that I ask is that you use the discount code for only one household, but you're more than welcome to give it away as a gift.</p>
<p>Finally, two of the perks include a funny t-shirt, designed by moi.  (You can tell from the t-shirt that I have a slightly raunchy sense of humor, but if you met me in person you would think that I am the most boring person on the face of the earth.  I guess the raunch only comes out when I write.  Muahahahahah....)</p>
<p>Please note that legally, we can only ship products containing hydrogen peroxide within the lower 48 states.  If you are in Hawaii or Alaska, please choose the ""Overseas Perk.""   Don't worry, this perk is just as cool as the others, just without the hydrogen peroxide.</p>
<p>We will start shipping packages out absolutely no later than February 1, 2017, but I anticipate we may start before that.   Your packages will be well in hand in time for your spring cleaning!  If you want some of our products sooner than that, you are welcome to place an order through our website <a href=""http://bit.ly/pyourecleaningindiegogostory"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.PyoureCleaning.com</a> (mention Indiegogo in your order notes and we'll be sure to hook you up).  </p>
<p>All of the discount codes will be emailed by January 5, 2017.</p>
<p><strong>Scents we offer:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>French Soap</li>
<li>Bamboo Verbena</li>

<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>Fortunately for you, there is little risk involved since a majority of our products already exist and we are fulfilling orders daily.   We manufacture and ship all of our cleaning products ourselves, and we do not have any of our items drop-shipped by another manufacturer.  </p>
<p>Of course it will suck if we don't receive all of our funding, but it will not prevent any of the perks from being shipped out.  It will just mean that it will take a bit longer for us to bring our <i>new</i> products to market.  All of the products in the perks are existing products.</p>
<p>If we get inundated with backers, that would be a dream come true.  But a large influx may mean some backers will experience a delay getting their packages.  But rest assured, regardless of the number of backers, we will still start shipping packages out no later than February 1, 2017, and everyone should have their rewards in time for spring cleaning. </p>
</div><div>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help</h2>
<p>If you can't contribute financially, that's cool - you can help us get the word out about our campaign!  There are so many good people out there looking for healthy ways to clean their homes, and Pyoure might just be the ticket.  Use the Indiegogo share tools and help us make some noise!</p>
<p>Regardless, thanks for reading this, and <strong>thank you for your support!</strong></p>
</div></div>","Background
Howdy!  My name is Raven and I created the cleaning products lovingly referred to as Pyoure.  I am a lawyer by trade, but please don't hold that against me.  By the time I saw the light, I was already $100k in student loan debt and figured I might as well have a go at salvaging my degree.  
I started Pyoure, not because I liked to clean, but because I hated it.  I hated the time it took out of my day, and I especially hated the guilt I felt as I sprayed the toxic solutions throughout my house.    Funny enough, I equally detest it when things around me are dirty.  You can imagine my torture.  
To ease my cleaning pain, I began to search for something that would make my own cleaning routine green, enjoyable, and go a lot faster.  The cleaning products that are on the market today just suck.  They're full of toxic chemicals that poison our families and waterways, the packaging is excessive, and they smell boring.  The only other alternative to these problems was to make your own green cleaning products.  The DIY recipes on the internet were green, but they didn't clean worth crap, and I couldn't trust the end product on the really tough jobs like when a family member got sick.
So I started to tinker (and I looooove to tinker), and ended up creating a concentrated product that combined hydrogen peroxide with organic detergents and beautiful fragrances.  I chose hydrogen peroxide because it is as effective at killing household germs as bleach, but it safely breaks down into oxygen and water when it's finished.  
I started using this new creation in my own home for everyday cleaning in addition to the occasional bout of diarrhea and vomiting that my two beautiful children would bestow upon me.  Surprisingly, sicknesses in my household didn't spread!  I also gave some away to my friends and neighbors who loved it and encouraged me to sell them online.  
This past January 2016 I opened an online store and we started selling Pyoure products to the masses!  Our customers love Pyoure and have consistently given it 5 star ratings across the board (and let me just say that we have the most loyal, encouraging, and all-around amazing customers on the planet).  Our customers have repeatedly raved about how Pyoure has drastically improved their cleaning routines because it cleans so well and smells so good.   (I highly recommend you check out our website and read the product reviews for yourself at www.PyoureCleaning.com.  None of the reviews were paid for or compensated in any way.)
Here's what makes Pyoure extra special:

Our cleaning products contain zero toxic ingredients.

Pyoure uses hydrogen peroxide to safely kill germs without harming our waterways.
Pyoure takes the guess work out of environmentally friendly, non-toxic cleaning.
We offer the largest variety of unique non-toxic scents that freshen your space for hours.
We are constantly innovating and have created an exclusive line of products:
sprayable hydrogen peroxide cleaning gel
designer reusable glass spray bottles that not only offer UV light protection, but are guaranteed to not chip or fade


Our soaps are organic and ultra concentrated.

Our skin-safe fragrances are beautifully complex, and are the same premium grade as those used in perfumes and body sprays.
Most of our finished products are concentrated.  This saves valuable cabinet space and allows the user to customize the strength of the cleaner based on their needs.
Pyoure reduces waste by using minimal packaging that is 100% recyclable.


What We Need
Pyoure products are wonderful, but we want to make them even better by doing the following:

Expanding our product line by adding specialized products for toilets, grout, carpet, and laundry
Adding biodegradable hydrogen peroxide wipes
Adding more premium custom fragrances that are cosmetic grade and phthalate free
Reducing our packaging even further by adding bigger and more concentrated quantities, and exploring additional biodegradable options
Improving our bottle filling equipment to stream-line the process
Improving our administrative tools such as label printers, software, computers, camera, shelves, and carts

Folks, all of this costs a LOT of money, but your funding will help us get there! 

What You Get
Ahhh.  Finally the good part!  If you invest your money with Pyoure, in return you will get some really awesome cleaning products.  Since you're going to needs cleaning products in the near future anyways, this is a pretty sweet deal!  Just one 8-ounce Concentrate will last approximately 2 to 3 weeks.  But beware, once you start using our products, you won't want to use any other cleaning product again.  
You will also receive a discount that you can use an unlimited amount of times, for the entire year of 2017, on absolutely anything on our website.   This is huge because we use discounts SPARINGLY.  And when I say sparingly, I mean almost never, and certainly not to this magnitude.   The only thing that I ask is that you use the discount code for only one household, but you're more than welcome to give it away as a gift.
Finally, two of the perks include a funny t-shirt, designed by moi.  (You can tell from the t-shirt that I have a slightly raunchy sense of humor, but if you met me in person you would think that I am the most boring person on the face of the earth.  I guess the raunch only comes out when I write.  Muahahahahah....)
Please note that legally, we can only ship products containing hydrogen peroxide within the lower 48 states.  If you are in Hawaii or Alaska, please choose the ""Overseas Perk.""   Don't worry, this perk is just as cool as the others, just without the hydrogen peroxide.
We will start shipping packages out absolutely no later than February 1, 2017, but I anticipate we may start before that.   Your packages will be well in hand in time for your spring cleaning!  If you want some of our products sooner than that, you are welcome to place an order through our website www.PyoureCleaning.com (mention Indiegogo in your order notes and we'll be sure to hook you up).  
All of the discount codes will be emailed by January 5, 2017.
Scents we offer:

French Soap
Bamboo Verbena
Coconut Lime
Sandalwood Apple
Laundry Day
Fragrance Free
Winter Spice
Cherry Blossom
Ginger Citrus Mint
Seaside Bloom
Sweetheart Bouquet
White Tea & Ginger

<h3>Who we are:</h3>
<p>Digital Beachhead is comprised of two military veterans; Mike Crandall, CEO and Principal Owner is a Service Disabled Combat Veteran with over 20 years active duty military service and Howard Zach, President and Co-Owner is a 7 year military service veteran.   After retiring from the military in 2010 Mike went to work for a large IT Government contracting company where he met Howard who has over 20 years of Government contracting experience.</p>
<p>After multiple corporate mergers and acquisitions we found ourselves unemployed and looking for ""what's next"".   Looking at available job opportunities we decided that our working relationship, knowledge of the field and connections we had garnered over the years the best opportunity would be to take the leap and venture out on our own.  This is how Digital Beachhead was formed.  </p>
<p>Since the formation of our company less than a year ago we have had the same finance issue repeat itself and is the reason we have ventured into crowd funding for support.  Working capital to pay employees while we wait for the Government to pay the company is the long pole in our small business tent.   Your support towards our goal means that we can bid on larger contracts which in turn will allow us to employ more people.   You will be supporting a Veteran's Administration Certified Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business (SDVOSB) AND all those we can employ because of that same support.   </p>
<p>In short, your support in what ever amount goes directly to supporting a small business grow and allowing us to hire more people in areas around the country thus supporting the community as a whole.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; Why</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Currently, Digital Beachhead is limited in the size of contract we can pursue due to operational income.  As owners we have had to fund our operations out of pocket as banks are unwilling to loan monies because we have no collateral.  Since we are looking for business loans we are unable to even put our own homes up as collateral and the business itself has no assets.  No donation is too small.</p>
<p>As a Government contractor our job is to bid on contracts the Government puts out via a number of sources.  Our focus is on IT and other Professional Services which means we would be hiring people to fulfill the requirements of the Government as outlined in their Request for Proposal/Quote.   We are competitive in this market as we have low overhead costs as a small business and due to our experience understand how to respond to these Government requests. </p>
<p>Our biggest concern is covering our employees salaries while we await the Government to make its first payment to the company.  As an example; if we were to win a contract that hired 10 IT professionals at $80,000 a year we would need roughly $112,000 a year per employee to cover salary, taxes, benefits etc.   This equates to $1,120,000 to cover a year worth of salaries and expenses.  Sounds great you say and we agree, however, the problem is the first 90 days of the contract.  </p>
<p>Starting day one of the contract the company is responsible, of course, for paying the employees.  The Government, however, does not pay in advance but instead at the 30 day mark allows for the first invoice to be submitted.  So Digital Beachhead is responsible for paying for those first 30 days before we are even allowed to invoice the Government.   If the Government is on time we could expect payment within 30 days.  In other words by the time we are sending our SECOND invoice we may get payment for the first.  This means the company has now paid for 60 days of our employees salaries before we see any return from the Government.  Our experience shows that is often is closer to 60 days before payment and thus 90 days total required in cash available in order to support a contract of this size.  With the scenario above we need roughly $94,000 a month to cover payroll for 2 to 3 months or a maximum of $280,000 before we see any return from the Government. </p>
<p>As you can imagine this is not something we have readily available.  Our first thought was to gain loans from the bank.  We know that once the contract is awarded the funds WILL be forthcoming from the Government we simply need the upfront cash infusion to cover expenses until the invoices start getting paid.  Banks, however, do not see a signed Government contract as collateral for repayment.  </p>
<p>Worst case scenario is that the Government cancels the contract for what ever reason earlier than expected.  The employees stop working yet the time they have worked is still covered and paid by the Government so invoices will be paid 30 to 60 days AFTER the stop of work which covers any/all costs.  In other words, no risk to the investment.</p>
<p>We are seeking a portion of the scenario estimate in this campaign.  Currently we have smaller  contracts that we have won which have taken most of our working capital.  These contracts, while showing our ability to succeed have impacted our ability to go for larger 10+ employee contracts.  Any monies gained from this campaign are going to go directly into our operational budget to cover employee costs upon contract award.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Supporting this campaign is supporting Veterans.  Currently 100% of our employees are military veterans.  While we know this may not be possible to achieve going forward on larger contracts, as veterans ourselves we remained focused on hiring veterans when/where possible. Your donation also directly supports a Veteran's Administration Certified Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business.  Your support allows us to go after larger contracts so that we may hire more employees and grow into a company that can give back and help the next generation of veterans as they transition into the civilian work force. </p>
<p>While Digital Beachhead is new to the Government arena the owners have worked this space for over 25 years on both sides of the equation.  We are certified by the Veteran's Administration and have won small government contracts within our first year.  </p>
<p>We ask for your support in our venture to grow so that we in turn can give back to those who have served.  Any support is appreciated and ALL proceeds will go to winning future bids and the hiring of new employees.  If we can get a small donation from a large number of people then our dream can become a reality.  No donation is too small.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can not support with a donation please forward to those you know.  Help us spread the word to make this campaign successful.   If you work withing the Government and know of future contracts we may have the opportunity to bid on please do forward those to us as well. </p>
<p>Your support is appreciated!!!  Thank you for taking the time to read over our campaign.</p>

<p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>Trisha and I are the new owners of The Clubhouse. When we took over in February, we had hoped that we could make the changes necessary to keep it up and running for our community. We have been working diligently and believe that we are slowly getting there, but as some of you know, we have been struggling and there is quite a bit over-head and many expenses. The bills are starting to add up and we are moving into slow months for our business. We are not ready to give up and close the doors, as we know that the community needs a place like The Clubhouse, so we’ve decided to appeal to our community for help keeping it open.</p>
<p>Let me explain in more detail why we decided to do this campaign.</p>
<p>When we decided to step up (and try to be heroines) and rescue The Clubhouse from closing, we didn’t realize how difficult it was actually going to be. We were (and still are) full of excitement and great ideas, but implementing them is proving to be difficult. Changes to improve a business takes money, and unfortunately the government is not making it easy for two working moms to get approved for a business loan. This is why we have come down to our last chance; asking you – our community – for help. It’s you who understand the value and importance of keeping this little gem alive and running in our town. We have met some amazing people and families in the few short months since becoming owners, and you have expressed your gratitude to us for taking it over and how much The Clubhouse means to you. Please help us put those words and emotions into action! With your help and support, we can keep The Clubhouse open.</p>
<p>We know that it sounds like a lot, but the reason we have set the amount at $15, 000 is that it will help us cover rent and utilities through September, when business starts to pick up again. We are confident that with this head start we will finally be able to get our feet on the ground and run with our amazing ideas, to make The Clubhouse even better in the fall. We are heading into nicer weather and business slows down significantly when kids can spend time outside again, and parents choose to have backyard parties. But remember, The Clubhouse is still a great place to come and play in the summer as well, as we have air conditioning, WiFi, and an outside area with toys, water/sand table and a large open grassy area where the bounce house will be set up from time to time. This is where we plan to put some of the funding raised to use. There is so much we can do with this outside space so it will be somewhere you can come and enjoy all year round, inside and out. Our dream is to have a place that kids and parents will want to come even in the nice weather, a place with access to fun stuff for kids, access to washrooms, appliances, running water, and to come in if it gets too hot or starts to rain. It will also be a</p>
<p>great option for birthday parties, if you want have to have it outside but would like have the inside as a backup plan for inclement weather.</p>
<p>Last Ditch Effort</p>
<p>So again, this is our last resort, our final pleas for help to save this amazing place. Every little bit helps. Ask yourself, what does The Clubhouse mean to you and your family. We know some of you have met lifetime friends here; my daughter who is two has met her bff here, too. As a parent, there is nothing more exciting than watching a friendship develop. We also know a lot of you meet here as a hallway place with friends who live far away. Many of you have had your child (or children’s) birthday party with us, and priceless memories have been made here. There is nothing like The Clubhouse; we have a special and unique space that provides so much more to the community than just a place to go.</p>
<p>Our vision is to increase employment, support other local small businesses, sponsor and support the schools and sports teams, and so much more. Please help us keep this dream alive. We know that it is achievable especially with your help. Since we took ownership over 4 months ago, we have been able to increase Facebook members by over 300 people; we have been marketing, advertising, and promoting like crazy, and we have many more amazing ideas we are ready to start implementing. We know our efforts have had a positive impact in helping The Clubhouse grow and be recognized by those who hadn’t discovered us yet. Unfortunately, it just hasn’t been quite enough, which, again, is why we have decided to try this crowd fundraiser.</p>
<p>We also understand that not everyone is in the financial position to support monetarily. Even by sharing this campaign and sharing your story about why The Clubhouse is so important to you would help immensely. Word of mouth is so important, especially in a small community like ours.</p>
<p>We have been completely transparent about why we are doing this campaign, what we will be doing with the funds, and how much it means to us. Rest at ease knowing that even when we reach our fundraising goal, we won’t stop working diligently to implement our ideas (and yours), to increase awareness and traffic to The Clubhouse as well as increase revenue to that it will a successful business that can stand on its own and grow.</p>
<p>We thank you so much for taking the time to read through our campaign and we hope with all our support we will all be able to love and enjoy The Clubhouse for decades to come!</p>
<p>From our hearts to yours,</p>
<p>Amy &amp; Trisha</p>

<h3>What is a Circus School?</h3>
<p>Many teachers will tell you to stop clowning around, but here at the circus school we are doing the complete opposite. We are a circus with a purpose to change peoples lives and inspire social and economic development. The Circus School of Lancaster is an alternative gym that provides classes and events around the circus arts. We want everyone to experience circus on a personal level through exploring their strengths in circus arts training. Each act or skill holds a deeper symbolic meaning that’s beyond just a great exercise experience. </p>
<h3>Not Just for Kids</h3>
<p>There is a growing trend of circus arts coming into the gym scene and we are seeing places like Philadelphia, New York, DC and other bigger cities taking on and embracing the expansion of their circus communities. It leaves people from smaller towns, like Lancaster, having to travel up to 2 hours away just to find a gym that accommodates their needs. We already have many different circus communities growing in Lancaster County and what we want to do is bring them all together.  Our focus will be on facilitating community around play and creating a network for people professionally.</p>

<h3>Circus for Everyone</h3>
<p>Whether you are circus curious, only beginning, or a lifer we will have classes accessible to all levels!</p>
<ul>
<li>Acrobatic Yoga</li>
<li>Juggling/Poi</li>
<li>Hooping</li>
<li>Aerials</li>
<li>Handstand training</li>
<li>Open Gyms</li>

</div><div>
<h3>Social Circus</h3>
<p>As part of our mission to serve the community we will facilitate social circus events throughout Lancaster, in neighborhoods, street corners, on First Friday, at schools and other institutions. Clowning around and performing circus tricks on streets brings local communities together and starts a conversation on social and political issues. We also want to deliver the message that anyone can do circus, no matter race, size, class or gender.</p>
<h3>Children &amp; Youth Workshops</h3>
<p>The circus arts transcends all boundaries and pushes physical limitations. It is our belief that through attending these workshops children will be able to explore their strengths in performance arts while accessing their creativity and building up their confidence, discipline and self-esteem.</p>
<ul><li>We have already announced 3 different circus camp workshops for this summer! They include hooping, acrobalance and aerials! We want to give a one of a kind circus experience to the youth of Lancaster this summer.<br/><br/>To learn more <a href=""http://circusschooloflancaster.com/index.php/circus-camp/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CLICK HERE.</a>

There is a growing trend of circus arts coming into the gym scene and we are seeing places like Philadelphia, New York, DC and other bigger cities taking on and embracing the expansion of their circus communities. It leaves people from smaller towns, like Lancaster, having to travel up to 2 hours away just to find a gym that accommodates their needs. We already have many different circus communities growing in Lancaster County and what we want to do is bring them all together.  Our focus will be on facilitating community around play and creating a network for people professionally.

Circus for Everyone
Whether you are circus curious, only beginning, or a lifer we will have classes accessible to all levels!

Acrobatic Yoga
Juggling/Poi
Hooping
Aerials
Handstand training
Open Gyms
Special Events

And MORE..lots more!


Social Circus
As part of our mission to serve the community we will facilitate social circus events throughout Lancaster, in neighborhoods, street corners, on First Friday, at schools and other institutions. Clowning around and performing circus tricks on streets brings local communities together and starts a conversation on social and political issues. We also want to deliver the message that anyone can do circus, no matter race, size, class or gender.
Children & Youth Workshops
The circus arts transcends all boundaries and pushes physical limitations. It is our belief that through attending these workshops children will be able to explore their strengths in performance arts while accessing their creativity and building up their confidence, discipline and self-esteem.
We have already announced 3 different circus camp workshops for this summer! They include hooping, acrobalance and aerials! We want to give a one of a kind circus experience to the youth of Lancaster this summer.To learn more CLICK HERE.


 
What We Need & What You Get
The amount raised will go towards ensuring our space at a beautiful co working space in downtown Lancaster, as part of the Lancaster Art Studio. As well as the proper gym equipment to make your circus experience as safe and enjoyable as a circus gym should be. Let's break it down!
The Break Down:

$5,000: Basic gym equipment such as, crash mats/tumbling mats, aerial silks, lyra, rigging equipment, flow toys, glow toys, handstand canes
$700: Down payment for co-working space at Lancaster Art Studio
$200: Basic marketing material such as shirts and print material
$200: Insurance coverage for one year

To give an idea of what some of this gym equipment will look like:

We are so excited about our perk opportunities and look forward to having your participation in the circus. And who doesn't like cotton candy?! Win. Win.

Meet the Circus Crew

After settling down and having twins with her husband she found a new found art in acrobatic yoga. She was able to use her knowledge of movement in a new profound way. Finding AcroYoga has opened the doors to other circus communities and Sheena is looking forward to bringing them all together for Lancaster to enjoy. She believes that everyone should play, no matter what their age!

<p>What follows is our fund raiser letter which describes the goals for our Founder in Cognito pre-sale, then a summarized vision of Cognito Brewing's place in the existing market.  Please read through, and feel free to contact us if you would like more information.</p>
<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>Our approach to brewing began the same way as most - by what we liked in other breweries, and what we wished was available.   Most breweries are great at explaining each of their beers from the basics of what style they are, to the subtle differences that make them unique.  We wanted to take this one step further, and when we found our pilot system, the model emerged.  Our pilot system is a dual, meaning side by side system where two batches can be made at one time.  Ours is 1 barrel on each side which is about 1000 pints of beer total.  </p>
<p>Often when brewers are creating recipes and particularly when they are trying new ingredients or techniques, they make a single change to a batch in order to evaluate just what that change contributes.  You see this on beer lists as a “SMaSH” or “single malt single hop” when the flavor of each is left alone to evaluate, or sometimes just to shine on its own as a success. Our dual system allows us to either try two different new things side by side, or to follow a more empirical model and use one side as a control with no change for comparison.  We, as craft beer customers and brewers were excited about this, and thought that our customers who brew or just want to understand brewing better would likely appreciate it as well.  Our vision is to have paired taps for tasting and to elicit feedback from our customers to help us decide which direction to go with the recipe - kind of a “choose your own adventure” beer. Eventually, after a series of changes, a beer that a lot of people enjoy will be the end result.  When the recipe is perfected, the dual system can be easily switched to cross circulate and make a single 2 barrel batch of the beer we know we want a lot of.  </p>
<p>As luck would have it, Colorado Brewing Systems started making a micro brew sized model of this same system, and it is getting stellar reviews.  We would like to order the 10 barrel version this system to be built and shipped about this time next year, after we prepare the annex portion of the elevator to hold its weight in the fall. Because of the demand for brewhouses, we need to submit that order with sizeable chunk down very soon in order to get it when we want it, and because the timing coincides with the purchase of the building, that’s a slightly challenging task. That, friends, is why we decided to offer lifetime memberships now, before and only before we are open, to our early supporters, at special rates.   We won’t sell lifetime memberships once we are open, so this is a limited opportunity to save big for years to come.  You get an awesome deal, we get to avoid brewing 24 hours a day, and we all get beer. Good idea, no?</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
<p>Mike, Shanna, Amber, Rich, and Erik</p>
<p>As we built our business plan we reviewed hundreds of brewery models and their business structures.   Several things became clear.  </p>
<p>1. It is a rare brewery that with good beer and solid management can’t succeed.  Brewery start-ups are still launching successfully in places with a dense concentration of breweries like Portland, OR and Grand Rapids, MI, and tiny towns in the middle of nowhere that wouldn't inspire even the most prolific big box store, are the surprising hosts of breweries with busy taphouses.</p>
<p>2. With high population comes high overhead so the idea that breweries are best off in high population density areas like Grand Rapids or summertime South Haven is not necessarily true.  By taking advantage of the very low overhead of a place like Bangor, MI yet benefitting from the populations of neighboring cities and the considerable traffic between them, we have found a relatively low risk model compared to that of breweries paying big city or tourist destination real estate prices.</p>
<p>3. Because the traffic going through Bangor in the summers includes a proportionately high number of tourists going to or from vacations and day trips in South Haven, they are uniquely prepared to be excellent customers. Here's why:</p>
<p>A. They have flexibility with their time.</p>
<p>B. They are generally prepared to spend money</p>
<p>C. Vacationing customers’ money is mentally allotted from the more liberal “leisure budget” vs. the more conservatively managed “grocery budget”.</p>
<p>D. People on vacation tend to be more open to trying something new.</p>
<p>E. They are aware that South Haven food merchants are or will be very busy</p> <p>4. By creating impetus (beyond the speed limit and the train) for these customers to stop, the door is opened for increasing other revenue in Bangor such as gas station, grocery, and leisure shopping sales. Because Cognito will follow the model of all the great breweries by being involved in and supportive of its community, customers will learn about trail town and train tourism and all of the wonderful reasons there are to make Bangor more than a short stop.</p>
<p><br/>3. The existing event rental business of the Bangor Elevator further mitigates the risk of this as a start up with its history of bookings that cover the building expenses with very little marketing.  There is clear room for increasing this revenue with added services, and simply by having the goal of being fully booked.  (Bob didn’t push the bookings because his goal was understandably to cover expenses without it being too much extra work.)  Saturdays in 2017 are currently at 50% booked with signed contracts and deposits, which puts us very close to the break even point for the building expenses, even though we have just begun increased marketing and added services.  </p>
<p>4. There is strong local support for this endeavor, in evidence most recently at our Founder in Cognito party. We are both humbled and impressed by the enthusiasm and wholehearted commitment to our success that the community has shown us.  We saw this at this incredible party, through our social media following, and we see it in the willingness of city officials to work with us.  The decision to call Bangor, MI Cognito Brewery's home has been our foundation in so many respects.  It is the choice we have the most confident in, and that we draw the most positive energy from.   Each day that we spend working within this community, we feel more sure that we are on the right path together.  We promise to follow the lead of great Michigan breweries before us and to be stewards of the community,  a force for meaningful change, and the very best neighbors.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Hi, my name is Geric Sambo and I was born and raised in Curaçao. I had been studying in Dallas since 2013 and just moved back to the island this past May.</li>
<li>Unexpectedly, I had to move back home in Curaçao and was in need of a job and quickly realized the shortage of job opportunities that there were on the island. I was aiming for finding a job that I can be more hands on towards tourism and it seemed that nothing was happening. One of my main concern was that I wasn't at peace as to working for someone else, yet this has always been the norm to have a boss, in my perspective. And here I was more and more wanting to start my own business if that were possible. Then I remembered I stumbled into an idea I got when I was living in Dallas of an all organic/ artisan ice pop shop that I had come across and daydreamed of, of starting something similar if I were ever to move back to Curaçao. Starting this business will not only help me business-wise, but I will be able to reach out to the tourists that visit the island as well. ( I will be stationed at the gate of ""The Floating Bridge"" on the Punda side)</li>
<li>Helping me achieve this goal, will not only help me provide for a job and hopefully create more job opportunities for others as well. I also have more ideas on reaching out to the community as well whenever I'm possible to give donations and free ice pops to institutes that have kids who are in need of lots of love and attention and creating a full event for them as well while partnering with different churches and youth groups.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<ul>
<li>To get things started, I'm asking for $1500 to start with. My biggest purchase is going towards buying an ice cream cart and cold plates to keep the ice pops to freezing temperature. Ice cream carts can cost from $600 to $3500 and this is just based in the U.S. I would still have to ship it to the island. And shipping can cost over $200 which is not even included the price of import tax, which is why my financial goal is ""so high"" being that I'm ""just making ice pops"". Other main purchases are: chest freezer for storage and of course making the ice pops to freeze and one buying wood branded popsicle sticks that will definitely make the products stand out and of course packaging for the ice pops. And a high-quality blender for mass quantity production and lastly a Patio Umbrella for setup outside at downtown with the ""POPCULTR"" cart.</li>
<li>The idea is to have a ""stand/ice cream cart"" setup in downtown, selling and interacting with the locals and the incoming tourists and promoting the island, but as well doing with catering service for corporate events, weddings, birthday parties etc. It's definitely something that has never been done before on the island and I know that it will be a great hit.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>I know that POPCULTR will be completely different than the rest of the businesses on the island is, that it's a first of it's kind, making and bringing great quality and an out of this world experience in taste bud's wise customer service wise.</li>
<li>I have been studying, researching and working on menu/recipes towards the Gourmet Ice Pop business ever since I've moved back and have set short-term and long-term goals. This is just the beginning of what's more to come in the near future.</li>
<li>Once you've donated and given your part and pledge into this vision/business, you are not just making an impact in my own life, but in the lives of everyone that I will encounter and putting a smile on their face and giving them an experience; One ice pop at a time !!</li>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<li>I would love for you to get the word out and make some noise about the ""POPCULTR"" campaign.</li>
<li>Share with at least 5 people that would love support a small business like this: parents, friends and family...all of them !!!</li>

<h3>About us</h3>
<p>Many Annapolis Valley locals may already know Ariell from her years at the Wolfville Farmer's Market.  For those who don't know her, she is the owner and culinary engine who drives all things food related at the Edible Art Café.  Following a fateful trip to Hawaii, with her husband Jesse in tow, the Edible Art Cafe was launched on the grounds of the old Horton High School.  The first year was filled with not only the business launch, but Jesse's immigration, and the birth of their first son Dax, culminating with being awarded ""Outstanding New Business of the Year"" by the Annapolis Valley Chamber of Commerce. </p>
<p>While this made for very full 2014, things have only accelerated since then, with the birth of baby Gavin in 2015, and all the incredible collaborations with the community.  The result is something truly unique and complementary to Ariell's culinary passion, along with Jesse's passion for hospitality, art, and music.</p>
<p>The Edible Art Café is not only the creative expression of its founders, but also the many members of the Annapolis Valley community who provide a diverse array of local art for sale, live music from 12-2pm 7 days a week, and all sorts of events.  As a home grown phenomenon in every sense of the word, this tapestry of creativity is fueled by 100% local people and products, which recirculates money back into the local economy with nearly every dollar spent. </p>
<p>By helping to achieve our goals, you can have a hand in not not only ensuring this amazing process continues, but helping to create something with an even larger and more sustainable impact in the long term... read on to find out how.</p>
<p>With our landlords facing foreclosure before the end of 2017, the purpose of our campaign is to purchase our 6000 square foot mixed-use commercial building.  The success that we've had in business has helped to qualify us for a mortgage, but we still need the down payment required at auction.  With previous plans to purchase the building in 2019, we've now been forced to raise funds in the short term to save our home and business. </p>
<p>Since we've never been the types to ask for help, preferring to focus on work and community collaborations, it was a difficult choice for us to do this campaign.   It was ultimately our many loyal and longtime customers who gave us the inspiration to share our story.  So many have shared that they can't imagine us leaving, and neither can we. </p>

<h3>Our Challenges &amp; Commitment</h3>
<p>Many people seem to see us as a wildly successful business with the parking lot always full.  While this is true to a point, the fact remains that we are in the poorest and highest taxed province in Canada.  Having started the cafe with literally nothing, we're proud to have had so much success, but growth and long overdue improvements have been painfully slow.</p>
<p>If you have never seen our facilities, just imagine operating at a commercial level from you tiny home kitchen.  The good news is that this has forced us to be extremely efficient in other ways.  Having to be profitable from day one, along with our ability to overcome adversity, has made for a potent combination relating to both expansion potential, and impact within the community.</p>
<p>As the growth of our family and business accelerates, we're gradually starting to work more on the business than in it.   Ultimately, being able to jump in and run things at any given moment has made all the difference, along with the amazing people who continue to show up.  With the vision now more clear than ever, we hope you'll join us.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time and consideration,   </p>

</div></div>","About us
Many Annapolis Valley locals may already know Ariell from her years at the Wolfville Farmer's Market.  For those who don't know her, she is the owner and culinary engine who drives all things food related at the Edible Art Café.  Following a fateful trip to Hawaii, with her husband Jesse in tow, the Edible Art Cafe was launched on the grounds of the old Horton High School.  The first year was filled with not only the business launch, but Jesse's immigration, and the birth of their first son Dax, culminating with being awarded ""Outstanding New Business of the Year"" by the Annapolis Valley Chamber of Commerce. 
While this made for very full 2014, things have only accelerated since then, with the birth of baby Gavin in 2015, and all the incredible collaborations with the community.  The result is something truly unique and complementary to Ariell's culinary passion, along with Jesse's passion for hospitality, art, and music.
The Edible Art Café is not only the creative expression of its founders, but also the many members of the Annapolis Valley community who provide a diverse array of local art for sale, live music from 12-2pm 7 days a week, and all sorts of events.  As a home grown phenomenon in every sense of the word, this tapestry of creativity is fueled by 100% local people and products, which recirculates money back into the local economy with nearly every dollar spent. 
By helping to achieve our goals, you can have a hand in not not only ensuring this amazing process continues, but helping to create something with an even larger and more sustainable impact in the long term... read on to find out how.
With our landlords facing foreclosure before the end of 2017, the purpose of our campaign is to purchase our 6000 square foot mixed-use commercial building.  The success that we've had in business has helped to qualify us for a mortgage, but we still need the down payment required at auction.  With previous plans to purchase the building in 2019, we've now been forced to raise funds in the short term to save our home and business. 
Since we've never been the types to ask for help, preferring to focus on work and community collaborations, it was a difficult choice for us to do this campaign.   It was ultimately our many loyal and longtime customers who gave us the inspiration to share our story.  So many have shared that they can't imagine us leaving, and neither can we.

<p>Steve Harms here, I have been in the bowling industry for over 30 years. I love bowling and helping others to enjoy the sport is what I live for. I started from the ground up as a pin chaser and progressed through the ranks to control desk for large centers all the while chasing the professional bowlers tour. I began bowling ball drilling back in 1987 and haven't stopped since. The reason for ""Harmsey's Bowling Service"" is the amount of interest for me to keep drilling from a large customer base that keeps calling me after losing my position at the bowling center due to the owner's decision to manage the center himself.</p>
<p>I’ve spent the last month working on a solution to service all my bowling clients’ needs.  I have talked to colleagues, family members and friends and with their help, I’ve decided to do something that’s never been done before in Salt Lake City.  This is something unexpected, but will give my clients the service they have come to expect from me.  I will be opening a business offering a pickup and delivery service for all my clients.  This means if they want to order equipment such as balls, bags or shoes, I’ll take their order and then personally deliver it to them.</p>
<p>My business will be a free-standing bowlers pro shop (my garage at the present time). Hopefully business will grow enough to open a store-front shop where current and new clients can visit if they want to.  With the influx of Family Entertainment Centers (FECs) growing in Utah that do not have bowling pro shop services, we feel that a free-standing pro shop could become a very  viable service to the bowling community in the next two years.</p>
<p>What I need is some help getting this project started. The strongest need is a drill press, so I can drill balls, a Cook's Sphere to refinish balls, and a ball spinner to handle the many aspects of bowling ball maintenance, and If I’m able, to get the free-standing space. There will be requirements for that:</p>
<p>            Office equipment and furniture</p>
<p>            Point of Sale equipment</p>
<p>            Display wall</p>
<p>            Product</p>
<p>            Signs</p>
<p>We need your help no matter what.  Your support of any kind will always be appreciated. There are many ways to support my efforts to bring my services back for you, my clients.</p>
<p>Please share the campaign with your friends and families any way you can, through social media, word-of-mouth or giving out my phone number or email address (<a href=""mailto:h.harms@att.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">h.harms@att.net</a>), especially if they live in Utah.  The tentative date for opening of HARMSEY’S BOWLING SERVICES will be the first of October, 2017.</p>

<p>For those of you contributing to our campaign, we will send you a certificate that will entitles you to one of our free perks, or if you choose one of our other items such as the logo sticker, t-shirt, hat or beanie, we will send those directly to you.   </p>

<h3>La nostra storia:</h3>
<p>Ciao da Verona, siamo Francesca Bortolaso e Mima Petrovic. Desideriamo condividere in poche parole chi siamo e lo scopo del nostro progetto: <strong>MANUFATTO</strong>. Francesca è un artista del vetro e Mima artigiana che crea gioielli coi tessuti. Ci siamo incontrate durante un evento a Verona e ben presto è nata la nostra collaborazione con la forte intenzione a dar vita a questo progetto. Nella nostra esperienza lavorativa abbiamo spesso riscontrato grande interesse ed apprezzamento per le creazioni autenticamente fatte a mano ma anche molta difficoltà nel trovare luoghi e situazioni adatti a promuoverle, oltre agli ingenti costi per  un eventuale  spazio proprio. Siamo consapevoli  che  aprire uno spazio dedicato all’artigianato oggi in Italia richiede molto coraggio ma <strong>siamo anche fermamente convinte che il nostro progetto possa crescere ed avere grande successo, anche con il vostro sostegno.</strong></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>The story:</strong></h3>
<p>Hello from Verona Italy, we are Francesca Bortolaso e Mima Petrovic. We would briefly like to share with you who we are and the offset of our project:  <strong>MANUFATTO</strong>. Francesca is a glass artist and Mima a craftwoman who makes fabric jewelry. We met during a craft event in Verona and soon our collaboration was born with the strong intention to give birth to this project. In our working experience we have found a great deal of interest and appreciation for authentic hand-made craftsmanship but a very hard and often frustrating  uphill  work in finding the best way to promote and sell our creations, due to the economic power of large scale mass production and the high costs of running a dedicated space of our own. This happens to be a common issue shared by most of the artisan community in Italy and stands at the base of our project idea. <strong>We are firmly convinced that our project will have great success and grow, also with your very significant and essential help.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499352319/wwlstubyas52fpjdytw3.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Cosa ci muove e l’impatto:</h3>
<p>Mima e Francesca sentono l’importanza ed il desiderio di fare business in modo nuovo e stimolante. <strong>MANUFATTO</strong> sarà un luogo dove molte “teste creative” potranno esporre e vendere le loro creazioni ed avere l’opportunità d’incontrarsi, dando vita anche a nuove sinergie e progetti. Desideriamo che <strong>MANUFATTO</strong> diventi un luogo attivo, un’oasi nel campo delle arti e mestieri. In tre parole: <strong>connessione, condivisione e relazioni.</strong> Siamo entrambe determinate nel fare co-working e nel condividere gli spazi con altri artigiani ed artisti. In questo modo potremo sostenere parte dei nostri costi fissi ed allo stesso tempo altre realtà avranno l’opportunità di vendere ed esporre le loro creazioni a costi sostenibili.<strong> Una strategia vincente!</strong> Il nostro obbiettivo è quello di contribuire a conservare, sostenere e sviluppare l’arte e la maestria del saper creare con le mani, la testa ed il...CUORE!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The core and impact:</h3>
<p>Mima and Francesca strongly feel the urge and desire to do business in a modern way. <strong>MANUFATTO</strong> will be a place where artisans and artists will be able to show and sell their creations and have the opportunity to meet and share ideas with other likeminded  people, possibly creating new synergies and projects. An active point and an oasis in the network of Arts and Crafts. In three words: <strong>connectdeness, sharing and relations</strong>. We are committed in co-working and sharing with other craftspeople, doing business with each other.  In this way we will  be able  to sustain part of our management costs meanwhile giving the opportunity to others to sell and exibit their work at sustainable costs.<strong> A win-win! </strong>Our possible aim will be to preserve, sustain and develop the art and mastery of creating with your hands, your mind and your...<strong>HEART! </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Dove:</strong></h3>
<p>Abbiamo trovato un luogo davvero speciale in un edificio di pregio,  affascinante ed antico. Uno spazio elegante nel centro storico di Verona molto vicino alla famosa Arena. Durante la recente ristrutturazione, nel basamento, è stata ritrovata parte della città romana e con sorpresa proprio una zona che era dedicata alla lavorazione dei metalli!  La posizione del negozio è davvero strategica per attirare sia i residenti sia molti turisti che dimostrano spesso grande apprezzamento per l’artigianato genuino e di qualità.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499352609/lsk3givvatx5ly8dxib0.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Location:</h3>
<p>We have found a special location that sits in a stylish historical building with large spaces and wide displays. It is beautiful, fascinating and antique, a fine space in the historical center of Verona, close to the famous Arena. During the recent building restauration archaeologists have found in the basement part of the ancient Roman town and surprisingly… an area specially dedicated to the manual work of metals. Our location is strategic for attracting local residents as well as many tourists always showing their deep appreciation and interest for authentic and original Arts and Crafts.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Cosa offriamo:</h3>

<p>2)      Isole espositive dedicate  (3 mesi/ max 1 anno).</p>
<p>3)      Sala per  mostre ,conferenze, laboratori ed eventi.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What we offer:</h3>
<p>MANUFATTO, besides hosting Francesca and Mima  workshops and creations, will offer rentable display spaces to the Italian and international artisan and artist community with the following modes:</p>
<p>1)      Temporary store (1 week to max 1 month).</p>
<p>2)      Dedicated exposition and selling corners (long term: 3 months/up to 1 year).</p>
<p>3)      Hall for exhibitions, conferences, workshops and events.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Cosa chiediamo:</h3>
<p>Chiediamo gentilmente il Vostro contributo per portare a termine la parte finale del progetto nell’equipaggiarlo, arredarlo e farlo partire. L’arredamento per <strong>MANUFATTO</strong> è stato disegnato e progettato con creatività e gusto e verrà prodotto a costi contenuti. Tutti i fondi raccolti saranno di grande  importanza e noi ci impegniamo ed essere trasparenti nel farne uso, condivideremo foto ed informazioni sull’avanzamento dei lavori e sul risultato finale. Vi terremo informati! Qualsiasi contributo sarà molto apprezzato e riceverà un ringraziamento.  </p>

</div></div>","La nostra storia:
Ciao da Verona, siamo Francesca Bortolaso e Mima Petrovic. Desideriamo condividere in poche parole chi siamo e lo scopo del nostro progetto: MANUFATTO. Francesca è un artista del vetro e Mima artigiana che crea gioielli coi tessuti. Ci siamo incontrate durante un evento a Verona e ben presto è nata la nostra collaborazione con la forte intenzione a dar vita a questo progetto. Nella nostra esperienza lavorativa abbiamo spesso riscontrato grande interesse ed apprezzamento per le creazioni autenticamente fatte a mano ma anche molta difficoltà nel trovare luoghi e situazioni adatti a promuoverle, oltre agli ingenti costi per  un eventuale  spazio proprio. Siamo consapevoli  che  aprire uno spazio dedicato all’artigianato oggi in Italia richiede molto coraggio ma siamo anche fermamente convinte che il nostro progetto possa crescere ed avere grande successo, anche con il vostro sostegno.
 
The story:
Hello from Verona Italy, we are Francesca Bortolaso e Mima Petrovic. We would briefly like to share with you who we are and the offset of our project:  MANUFATTO. Francesca is a glass artist and Mima a craftwoman who makes fabric jewelry. We met during a craft event in Verona and soon our collaboration was born with the strong intention to give birth to this project. In our working experience we have found a great deal of interest and appreciation for authentic hand-made craftsmanship but a very hard and often frustrating  uphill  work in finding the best way to promote and sell our creations, due to the economic power of large scale mass production and the high costs of running a dedicated space of our own. This happens to be a common issue shared by most of the artisan community in Italy and stands at the base of our project idea. We are firmly convinced that our project will have great success and grow, also with your very significant and essential help.
 

 

Cosa ci muove e l’impatto:
Mima e Francesca sentono l’importanza ed il desiderio di fare business in modo nuovo e stimolante. MANUFATTO sarà un luogo dove molte “teste creative” potranno esporre e vendere le loro creazioni ed avere l’opportunità d’incontrarsi, dando vita anche a nuove sinergie e progetti. Desideriamo che MANUFATTO diventi un luogo attivo, un’oasi nel campo delle arti e mestieri. In tre parole: connessione, condivisione e relazioni. Siamo entrambe determinate nel fare co-working e nel condividere gli spazi con altri artigiani ed artisti. In questo modo potremo sostenere parte dei nostri costi fissi ed allo stesso tempo altre realtà avranno l’opportunità di vendere ed esporre le loro creazioni a costi sostenibili. Una strategia vincente! Il nostro obbiettivo è quello di contribuire a conservare, sostenere e sviluppare l’arte e la maestria del saper creare con le mani, la testa ed il...CUORE!
 
The core and impact:
Mima and Francesca strongly feel the urge and desire to do business in a modern way. MANUFATTO will be a place where artisans and artists will be able to show and sell their creations and have the opportunity to meet and share ideas with other likeminded  people, possibly creating new synergies and projects. An active point and an oasis in the network of Arts and Crafts. In three words: connectdeness, sharing and relations. We are committed in co-working and sharing with other craftspeople, doing business with each other.  In this way we will  be able  to sustain part of our management costs meanwhile giving the opportunity to others to sell and exibit their work at sustainable costs. A win-win! Our possible aim will be to preserve, sustain and develop the art and mastery of creating with your hands, your mind and your...HEART! 
 
Dove:
Abbiamo trovato un luogo davvero speciale in un edificio di pregio,  affascinante ed antico. Uno spazio elegante nel centro storico di Verona molto vicino alla famosa Arena. Durante la recente ristrutturazione, nel basamento, è stata ritrovata parte della città romana e con sorpresa proprio una zona che era dedicata alla lavorazione dei metalli!  La posizione del negozio è davvero strategica per attirare sia i residenti sia molti turisti che dimostrano spesso grande apprezzamento per l’artigianato genuino e di qualità.
 

 
Location:
We have found a special location that sits in a stylish historical building with large spaces and wide displays. It is beautiful, fascinating and antique, a fine space in the historical center of Verona, close to the famous Arena. During the recent building restauration archaeologists have found in the basement part of the ancient Roman town and surprisingly… an area specially dedicated to the manual work of metals. Our location is strategic for attracting local residents as well as many tourists always showing their deep appreciation and interest for authentic and original Arts and Crafts.
 
Cosa offriamo:
MANUFATTO, oltre ad ospitare i laboratori e le creazioni di Francesca e Mima, offre degli spazi espositivi in affitto ad artigiani, artisti e creativi italiani ed  internazionali con le seguenti modalità:
1)      Temporary store (1 settimana /max 1 mese).
2)      Isole espositive dedicate  (3 mesi/ max 1 anno).
3)      Sala per  mostre ,conferenze, laboratori ed eventi.
 
What we offer:
MANUFATTO, besides hosting Francesca and Mima  workshops and creations, will offer rentable display spaces to the Italian and international artisan and artist community with the following modes:
1)      Temporary store (1 week to max 1 month).
2)      Dedicated exposition and selling corners (long term: 3 months/up to 1 year).
3)      Hall for exhibitions, conferences, workshops and events.
 
Cosa chiediamo:
Chiediamo gentilmente il Vostro contributo per portare a termine la parte finale del progetto nell’equipaggiarlo, arredarlo e farlo partire. L’arredamento per MANUFATTO è stato disegnato e progettato con creatività e gusto e verrà prodotto a costi contenuti. Tutti i fondi raccolti saranno di grande  importanza e noi ci impegniamo ed essere trasparenti nel farne uso, condivideremo foto ed informazioni sull’avanzamento dei lavori e sul risultato finale. Vi terremo informati! Qualsiasi contributo sarà molto apprezzato e riceverà un ringraziamento.  
 

 
What we need:
We kindly ask for your help in bringing our final part of the project to good, equipping, furnishing and decorating our space,  allowing the whole project to take off. An aesthetic and trendy furniture has been expressly  designed  for  MANUFATTO and will be produced at reasonable costs. The raised funds will have an ultimate role at this time and we are committed to being transparent and promise to share pictures and information with you throughout the working progress and the final outcome. We will keep you updated! Any contribution will be very important to us, appreciated and thanked for.  Please share our page via email and social media.

<h3>PROJECT BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>Our mission is to provide an Eco-friendly and efficient cleaning service that provides a value to customers as well as a living wage to the cleaners.</p>
<p>Growing up in Washington, DC with a single mother of five, I know first-hand how not making a living wage creates a scarcity of the most basic resources. As a service-disabled veteran of the United States Army and a homeless veterans social worker. I now witness veterans working multiple jobs, many of them as cleaners and see how the lack of a living wage effects the ability to have a sense of housing stability.</p>
<h3><strong>The Problem: </strong></h3>
<p><strong>The average wage for a cleaner is under $10.50/hr.(<a href=""https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes372012.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes372012.htm</a>), the living wage for an adult and one child in Lancaster, PA is more than $21/hr. (<a href=""http://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/42071"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://livingwage.mit.edu/counties/42071</a>).</strong></p>
<h3><strong>The Solution:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>A membership based, monthly flat-fee business model that utilizes mobile technology to deliver a cost-effective, Eco-friendly cleaning solution to consumers as well as a thriving wage to employees!</strong></p>
<h3>How does it work?</h3>
<p>Our flat fees are transparent and based on the size of a home. We listened to consumers through market research and found that most consumers generally only have the common areas of their homes cleaned on a regular basis.</p>
<p>This is what we came up with:</p>
<p>Pay a yearly membership and a flat monthly fee: Get one deep cleaning of living room, dining room and kitchen, plus a bathroom. Bi-weekly a Sage &amp; Shield cleaner will come to the home to maintain those areas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ex: 1500sqft home= $110 yearly membership and $75 monthly fee.</li>
<li>Ex: 2000sqft home= $140 yearly membership and $105 monthly fee.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why our model works:</h3>
<p>Typical cleaning companies can charge a <strong>minimum</strong> of $50/hr. with a three hour minimum to clean negotiated areas of a home one time and Eco-friendly cleaning costs more! </p>
<p>A deep cleaning of a 2000sqft home (common areas) can cost $300 or more just for one cleaning with competitors. Remember, the cleaner on average is only making under $10.50/hr.!</p>
<p>Our business model not only is a value but it also makes a cleaning service financially feasible to more consumers.</p>
<h3>Impact:</h3>
<p>We use technology in such a way that it serves as a logistical tool and a vehicle for efficiency. Combined with a comprehensive cleaning method, our business is saving time.</p>
<p>Our flat-fee system also means flat-compensation. Our cleaners receive roughly 45% of the tiered monthly fee per bi-weekly cleaning. This means that our employees can average at or above the living wage!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are seeking funding $8,000 in funding to assist in startup expenses. A large part of the business is based on the development of our mobile application, website, training  and devices which will account for $5,000. The remaining $3,000 will go to  industry certifications, licensing, cleaning equipment and administration.</p>
<p>Though knowing your dollars will strengthen the community and provide opportunity, there are some fun perks available as a reminder of your contribution!</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you cannot donate at this time, you can still support our mission and campaign by sharing on your social media sites like Facebook or Twitter, or with your family and friends. Please spread the word about what Sage &amp; Shield is trying to accomplish and encourage others to share!</p>

<p>At its core, LiveShopBuy’s hosting infrastructure consists of multiple web application servers fed by an inline load balancer that can auto-detect performance problems and reallocate load accordingly over multiple servers. This cluster sits on an internal Gig-E network to provide instant updates to the entire cluster whenever a change is made. Within this model we also host our firewalling, content delivery network  and staging environments. This configuration also employs the latest Dell server hardware on both the front and back-end to deliver exceptional performance during the busiest of holiday seasons. </p>

Paying seller fees could be a very small price to pay for new customers learning about your business and an increase in sales.</p><p>Amazon, the Goliath of online shopping and the behemoth responsible for shuttering the doors of retail brick-and-mortar establishments, is now getting into the grocery game. In the same way bookstores and clothing outlets have been asking themselves how they’re going to survive.  And more importantly, how are all small local companies going to be able to compete with the marketing and distribution channels Amazon has in place?</p><p>It’s no secret that commerce is increasingly living in the digital domain, with rising shares of retail revenue taking place online over time. Businesses have had to fight tooth and nail to be competitive, stand above the crowd, and be successful. They need to have an online platform, social media visibility, e-commerce and multi-channel experiences in place in order to thrive in today's market.</p><p>More and more Smaller Retailers are looking to third-party solutions because building something in-house to compete with Amazon is a major stretch. Most retailers are experts within their niche – not so much the tech-mobile-on-demand-delivery business.</p><p>The truth is, this is really only the beginning of a massive shift—not just in how we purchase our food, books or clothes, but how people source just about everything that marketers can supply. Tech is the reason we don’t hail cabs off the side of the street anymore. Tech is the reason we download our books instead of perusing the aisles of a bookstore. And pretty soon, tech will be the reason we repeat-order our groceries through an app, rather than walking through the store with a rickety metal shopping cart.</p><p><strong>What customers want is ease.</strong></p><p>So how can local merchants and e-commerce businesses stay competitive in this Amazon-dominated market?</p><p>·         <strong>Offer Exclusives -</strong> ""Exclusivity goes a long way. Offering certain items that are only sold on your company's website is a great way to drive traffic and gain loyal customers, even if you sell other products on Amazon.  These personal touches are the types of things consumers can't get when shopping on Amazon.</p><p>·         <strong>Branding Is Key -</strong> In the Amazon economy, the lowest priced product that meets basic needs is usually purchased.  So to compete, your company needs to be more than basic; it needs to be a brand. Brands are more than the products they sell.</p><p>·        <strong> Offline Experiences </strong>- Set your company apart by offering in-person services or events in your local market. There is no replacement for human connection and the more your company can build a loyal customer following through in-person events, the more likely customers are to remember you and revisit your website or attend future events.</p><p>·         <strong>If You Can't Beat Them, Join Them </strong>– If your company is looking for a growth strategy, it may just be in your best interest to put your products on a third part marketplace and capitalize from their services and traffic. Paying seller fees could be a very small price to pay for new customers learning about your business and an increase in sales.</p><p>While many people seem to believe that brick-and-mortar retail will soon be a thing of the past, tech giants like Amazon are proving that is far from true. Physical locations will still be part of the business landscape – they just might operate with different purposes.</p><p>Our lives are getting busier and busier, and people are becoming more than willing to give their business to companies that make their shopping experiences that much easier. Which means, if smaller chains are going to survive in the new world of consumerism, where tech is perfectly integrated into the brick-and-mortar businesses that line every street, they are going to have to operate with the same mentality that has driven Amazon to the position it’s in today.</p><p><strong>The small retailers that continue to think they don’t need to start thinking more seriously about integrating digital channels?

As a merchant, you cannot get onto Walmart’s marketplace unless you meet their strict guidelines, are an established business with enormous sales and have a history of high ratings and reviews from other marketplaces. On Amazon and others, merchants with the highest ratings and reviews tend to come up first in search results. LiveShopBuy on the other hand is a Location-based marketplace so when a consumer shops, the merchants in that shopper’s hometown profile come up first in search results even if they shop from a location outside their hometown.

But we also know how tough it is for small businesses to fairly compete against the big box stores and national chains dominating the market.To combat this, we’ve created an online sales platform and marketplace exclusively designed for small businesses (i.e. professional service providers, local merchants, home grown enterprises) and their customers.Why LiveShopBuy?• You will never find a BIG BOX store on LiveShopBuy.• Shoppers have the option to pick up orders in store from their local merchant.• Shoppers are rewarded with loyalty points • LiveShopBuy helps local communities fund existing programs that assist the needy with shelter, food, and clothing.• LiveShopBuy gives merchants and small businesses unrivaled local exposure but with a national reach.   Additionally, in providing services to local merchants and goods to local consumers, we hope to change the current, impersonal view of e-commerce. Bringing together local buyers and sellers will help boost the community economically and socially! This idea prompted another facet of our company, LiveShopCommunity. LiveShopCommunity will donate up to  5% of LiveShopBuy's merchant sales profits back to the community. This program will help provide essentials like food, clothing, shelter and healthcare to the less fortunate, while focusing on long-term solutions such as education, job training and employment, and help fund existing community charities. By buying through LiveShopBuy, merchants and consumers can be assured that their support, no matter how big or small, contributes to positive change in  their community. But to get off our feet, there are some funds to raise to complete our marketplace, and we can't do it without you! In exchange for financial gifts, we're offering a variety of perks. If you don't see a perk to your liking, however, you can donate whatever works for you by clicking ""back it"" and pledging any amount you choose.  It is impossible to account for every problem that your business is going to face, but planning and implementing good practices is essential for success. If you're like us, you plan on being in business for a very long time, and it makes good business sense to get onto channels that'll help your business grow most efficiently.Check out our Pro and Premium Membership programs--they're deals of a lifetime! As a merchant, you'll get all the options you'll ever need to market your business for the next ten years, and for only pennies a day. Pro = $0.23/day and Premier = $0.33/dayOur Perks Offer Amazing SavingsMarketing your business has never been so affordable, so don't be penny wise and dollar foolish! The discounts offered through this campaign are huge and something that should be seriously considered.  Our founders realized that there were little to no affordable marketing programs for local merchants, let alone a marketplace that allows them to compete equally against the more seasoned, higher-rated and most reviewed merchants, so we sought out to create one. LiveShopBuy combines the best available advertising and marketing technologies in order to do just that. Our sales platform will equip small businesses with the digital tools essential for successful competition (including but not limited to a business website to sell their products and services, social media presence, and Geo-targeted advertising), while our marketplace will give customers access to the unique products and services advertised.

 Some people start businesses to work for themselves, some to improve their quality of life, and some merely see an opportunity in the market that they can’t resist.  But for LiveShopBuy, it was different. Over the years, we grew tired of seeing so many of our favorite businesses suffering and going out of business.  Because of it, we wanted to come up with a way to help small local businesses compete and flourish.This is when the idea of LiveShopBuy came to life!We’re experienced, energetic and aiming to change the way consumers shop locally forever!Follow us! The Bell Labs Holmdel Complex in Holmdel Township, New Jersey is the headquarters for LiveShopBuy.  The facility functioned for forty-four years as a research and  development facility, initially for the Bell System.  This modernist building, dubbed ""The Biggest Mirror Ever"" by Architectural Forum, due to its mirror box exterior, was the site of at least one Nobel Prize discovery the laser cooling work of Steven Chu.The building which offers 2,000,000 square feet has undergone renovations into a multi-purpose living and working space, dubbed Bell Works by its redevelopers, and as of 2016, the former Bell Labs complex has been experiencing a renaissance as a business incubator for high-tech startup companies which is one of the main reasons we choose it as our home.  Through Your Generous Support

At its core, LiveShopBuy’s hosting infrastructure consists of multiple web application servers fed by an inline load balancer that can auto-detect performance problems and reallocate load accordingly over multiple servers. This cluster sits on an internal Gig-E network to provide instant updates to the entire cluster whenever a change is made. Within this model we also host our firewalling, content delivery network  and staging environments. This configuration also employs the latest Dell server hardware on both the front and back-end to deliver exceptional performance during the busiest of holiday seasons. 

 

Our Future Network


 These local merchants are already on board and excited to see how their company, customers, and communities will benefit from LiveShopBuy. So why not support us, too? You have nothing to lose! Whether it's by telling your friends about us or giving us a financial gift, we truly appreciate your support! If you don’t think LiveShopBuy can help you with your online digital presence read this article: Do Local Merchants Stand a Chance In E-Commerce Wars With Amazon?“If your company is looking for a growth strategy, it may just be in your best interest to put your products on a third part marketplace and capitalize from their services and traffic. Paying seller fees could be a very small price to pay for new customers learning about your business and an increase in sales.Amazon, the Goliath of online shopping and the behemoth responsible for shuttering the doors of retail brick-and-mortar establishments, is now getting into the grocery game. In the same way bookstores and clothing outlets have been asking themselves how they’re going to survive.  And more importantly, how are all small local companies going to be able to compete with the marketing and distribution channels Amazon has in place?It’s no secret that commerce is increasingly living in the digital domain, with rising shares of retail revenue taking place online over time. Businesses have had to fight tooth and nail to be competitive, stand above the crowd, and be successful. They need to have an online platform, social media visibility, e-commerce and multi-channel experiences in place in order to thrive in today's market.More and more Smaller Retailers are looking to third-party solutions because building something in-house to compete with Amazon is a major stretch. Most retailers are experts within their niche – not so much the tech-mobile-on-demand-delivery business.The truth is, this is really only the beginning of a massive shift—not just in how we purchase our food, books or clothes, but how people source just about everything that marketers can supply. Tech is the reason we don’t hail cabs off the side of the street anymore. Tech is the reason we download our books instead of perusing the aisles of a bookstore. And pretty soon, tech will be the reason we repeat-order our groceries through an app, rather than walking through the store with a rickety metal shopping cart.What customers want is ease.So how can local merchants and e-commerce businesses stay competitive in this Amazon-dominated market?·         Offer Exclusives - ""Exclusivity goes a long way. Offering certain items that are only sold on your company's website is a great way to drive traffic and gain loyal customers, even if you sell other products on Amazon.  These personal touches are the types of things consumers can't get when shopping on Amazon.·         Branding Is Key - In the Amazon economy, the lowest priced product that meets basic needs is usually purchased.  So to compete, your company needs to be more than basic; it needs to be a brand. Brands are more than the products they sell.·         Offline Experiences - Set your company apart by offering in-person services or events in your local market. There is no replacement for human connection and the more your company can build a loyal customer following through in-person events, the more likely customers are to remember you and revisit your website or attend future events.·         If You Can't Beat Them, Join Them – If your company is looking for a growth strategy, it may just be in your best interest to put your products on a third part marketplace and capitalize from their services and traffic. Paying seller fees could be a very small price to pay for new customers learning about your business and an increase in sales.While many people seem to believe that brick-and-mortar retail will soon be a thing of the past, tech giants like Amazon are proving that is far from true. Physical locations will still be part of the business landscape – they just might operate with different purposes.Our lives are getting busier and busier, and people are becoming more than willing to give their business to companies that make their shopping experiences that much easier. Which means, if smaller chains are going to survive in the new world of consumerism, where tech is perfectly integrated into the brick-and-mortar businesses that line every street, they are going to have to operate with the same mentality that has driven Amazon to the position it’s in today.The small retailers that continue to think they don’t need to start thinking more seriously about integrating digital channels? They’ll be the ones who end up starving."" Why Indiegogo? Since LiveShopBuy began in 2015 the founders have been bootstrapping the project. In June 2017, a friends and family round was offered. To date we have raised $100,000.00. Indiegogo gives us the freedom to share our story supporting local merchants all across America and giving back to our communities. Through your support and referral, we can complete the development of our platform and start our marketing efforts.   I am just starting my business and will not be open for another 6 months. Can I still purchase a Merchant Perk? Yes, you do not have to own a business to purchase a Merchant Perk. You may activate a Merchant perk 6 months from now when your business is ready to open. Your 10-year membership will start on that date. Thank you for your support. Can I really get a ten-year subscription to LiveShopBuy for the price of one year? Yes, only through this Indiegogo campaign are we offering this once in a lifetime opportunity to purchase a 10-year membership to any of our merchant membership products. This allows businesses to sell their products and services without having to pay any monthly or annual fees for the next ten years.It is impossible to account for every problem that your business is going to face, but planning and implementing good practices is essential for success. If you're like us, you plan on being in business for a very long time, and it makes good business sense to get onto channels that'll help your business grow most efficiently.Check out our Pro and Premium Membership programs--they're deals of a lifetime! Through this Indiegogo campaign, you'll get all the options you'll ever need to market your business for the next ten years, and for only pennies a day. Pro = $0.23/day and Premier = $0.33/dayWhat are BuyCoins? A “BuyCoin” is the name for the reward points in LiveShopBuy. BuyCoins are virtual currency that you earn when purchasing products and services on LiveShopBuy. BuyCoins may also be redeemed at checkout for products and services. They may also be gifted to other members or converted into LiveShopBuy Gift Cards.            If I purchase a Shopper perk when can I use my BuyCoins?BuyCoins may be redeemed at checkout for products and services. They may also be gifted to other members or converted into LiveShopBuy Gift Cards. You will receive an email notification with instructions on how to create an account in LiveShopBuy’s marketplace prior to the public launch scheduled in Q4 2017. Your BuyCoins will be credited to your account at that time. How can I contact LiveShopBuy?If you cannot find the answers to your questions in the FAQs or at LiveShopMerchant.com, you may contact us by email Contactus@LiveShopBuy.com or 732-334-1515 option 1When will my Perks be delivered?If you purchased a Shopper Perk you will be notified via email prior to our Public launch tentatively scheduled in December 2017. If you purchased a Merchant Perk you will be notified prior to the Beta Merchant Launch tentatively scheduled in October 2017. All physical items i.e. T-Shirts, Baseball Caps etc. will ship out in October. If you purchased the Entrepreneur Perk you will receive an email invitation to schedule your private tour of LiveShopBuy’s awesome corporate campus including lunch and conversations with the founders of LiveShopBuy.Aren’t you all a bit crazy to build a ""National Marketplace"" to help all small local merchants compete against the large national retailers?Call us crazy but soon small businesses will have nowhere to go aside from building their own web site and doing their own marketing. And the problem they will face is the extreme cost of marketing and maintenance. What about Amazon, eBay, Walmart and other marketplaces? Good question! As a merchant, you cannot get onto Walmart’s marketplace unless you meet their strict guidelines, are an established business with enormous sales and have a history of high ratings and reviews from other marketplaces. On Amazon and others, merchants with the highest ratings and reviews tend to come up first in search results. LiveShopBuy on the other hand is a Location-based marketplace so when a consumer shops, the merchants in that shopper’s hometown profile come up first in search results even if they shop from a location outside their hometown. Please view our video for information on our community give back program.When will I be notified to set-up my business account?You will receive updates through this Indiegogo campaign as well as an email notifying you prior to our Merchant Beta launch. We are on schedule to launch the Merchant beta site in October.What is a gold membership?When a consumer or merchant creates an account with LiveShopBuy they are registered into our Loyalty Rewards Program at the Gold Membership level and receives 1,000 reward points called BuyCoins. As the member accumulates more points they are upgraded to the next membership level with additional benefits. LiveShopBuy membership level information will be posted on the web site. You will be notified of all announcements in advance as a contributor of a LiveShopBuy Perk.How can I contribute? What payment methods do you offer?All payments are handled through Indiegogo’s payment processing.

<h3>The Nosh Pit Detroit</h3>
<p>The Nosh Pit Detroit is a truck that is on a mission to change the world one delicious bite at a time. We compost, recycle and source local ingredients to offer a variety of vegan and vegetarian eats and sweets.  Our mission and motivation is to help people incorporate more vegetables into their diet without sacrificing any taste.</p>
<p><strong>Our Story:</strong><br/>Karen, Stefan, and Eric met in a Detroit area cooking group. Stefan was leaving his job in the music industry and Karen was leaving hers in sustainability services. Eric is design and technology guru. They all got together and came up with a food truck concept that combined Stefan's creative cooking with clean healthy foods and Karen and Eric’s love of veganism and baked goods. </p>
<p>Although we are just barely over one year old, we have won several local awards including: Best in Show for Arts, Beats &amp; Eats 2017, 1st place for our hummus at the Shawarma Fest in Royal Oak, 2016, 2nd place for the best restaurant at the International Veg Fest in Novi, 2016 and 3rd place for the best pumpkin recipe (Pumpkin Soup) at Detroit Food Labs, 2016. We were nationally recognized in 2017 as one of the best vegan / vegetarian food trucks by Mobile Cuisine.</p>
<p>Having a brick and mortar location would allow us to not only provide mobile cuisine but have a location where we can increase our ability to cater and have a place that the Detroiters can count on, year round.  With your contributions, our vision is to not only to have a brick and mortar location for food service, but a location that is large enough to host regular food truck rallies, offer composting services and support our local community.”</p>

<p><strong>W</strong>e started <strong>Pursuit OCR</strong> three years ago as a place for people who like to laugh while they sweat together and play. Like a lot of you, We were tired of gyms and feeling like exercise had to be soooo serious. So we took all the best parts of the playground and brought it indoors so you can run and climb and crawl all year round. We wanted to create a space that was inclusive and felt like you could really cheer on the people around you. Accessible year-round, rain or shine, Pursuit OCR became the place for people of all fitness levels - from the hardcore racer to the group of friends looking for a new way to work up a sweat before beer and wings.</p>

It's not just for fitness enthusiasts looking for an alternative workout, it's also a place where you can really engage with people. We pride ourselves on being a non judgmental inclusive space and that's not just lip service. We want to show that you can build a space that is considerate of all identities and abilities  in the fitness community and one that gives back to those communities as well. So many of you have come through  and shared your life celebrations, first dates, birthdays and conquered things that you weren't even sure you could. We're proud to have watched you run up that warp wall while people cheered you on, We laughed with you as you splashed down in our ballpit and won our nerf wars.Our first home was a great example of what can happen when great people join in on a great idea. We've loved being a home to all that and we're excited to continue on that path with you and provide you with the space to shine.
 
We'd also love if you can share this campaign with friends, co workers and family. Maybe you have that cousin that loves American Ninja Warrior and would love to see if they could compete? That hard to shop for friend that did the Tough Mudder last year and had a blast? This is perfect for them! The company outing that you're trying to plan and no one wants to do the same thing they did last year? This is going to make you look like a hero! Help us out and we'll be forever grateful and I'm sure the person you share it with will think you're just the best too.

<h3>Eclectic Cafe</h3>
<p>I am Melanie Robinson. I'm a Wife, a Mom, and a Chef. </p>
<p>At 30 I choose to return to school in 2010 to pursue a love of cooking. I enrolled at Georgian College with the support of my husband, family and friends. When I stepped into school for the second time, it couldn't have felt more complete, this is what I was to do with my life. To show people love through food. </p>
<p>During school, I took at every opportunity that I was presented with. Since I was returning to school for the second time around I had to push and challenge my self. I competed in several competitions, became the junior president of the Muskoka Chefs Association, won a stage to Kelowna BC with the Canadian Culinary Federation in 2012. Most recently competing on Chopped Canada in season 3 episode 9 and winning my episode against 3 other Chefs across Canada.</p>
<p><strong><i>So then if I won Chopped Canada why am I doing a crowdfunding campaign you may ask?</i></strong></p>
<p>Well there are two answers to that one!</p>
<p>To start, right after the show I realized I was 3 weeks pregnant.  When the show finally aired I was 8 1/2 months pregnant.  Going on maternity leave on a cook's salary is pretty thin so most of the money went to supporting our new and growing family of 4, Melanie, Mike, Madelyn and Myles.</p>
<p>And the second reason for needing a little help from my friends is, I am moving into to a new space in downtown Orillia. I am opening December 20, 2017 on a bare bone budget, utilizing most of my equipment from home, and with some incredible help I am able to open in a limited capacity.</p>
<p>I want to be the local cafe that is known for helping others, supporting my local community, local farmers, producers and artisans. I want to be able to say I am exclusively using local produce. Creating menus on a weekly basis with what is in season and available. I want to be the one in the community that is known for helping each other out, paying it forward and supporting one another. </p>
<p>This campaign is important to me because it will not only help me grow, but also support the local culinary community as well.  I strive to engage the youth with an interest in culinary arts, paying it forward and being a supporter for the local farm fresh movement.</p>
<p>With the help and support of contributors I would be able to operate at a much higher level then I can at this time.</p>
<ul>
<li>I could purchase commercial equipment that will allow me to create a larger quantity of goods, and a much more efficient kitchen.</li>
<li>Allow us to expand and participate at more local farmer’s markets in the area.</li>
<li>Training youth with an interest in culinary arts and offer employment in the area.</li>
<li>Create community events such as the ""Common Ground"" dinner series in the carousel commons alley way. This would be a celebration of local food around a communal table with like minded people and Chefs.</li>
<li>We would be able to reach a larger demographic in the Simcoe county area by expanding srvices.</li>
<li>Paying it forward, being a supporter for the local movement.</li>
</ul>
<p>In closing, every dollar we raise through this campaign will directly result in keeping your hard earned money within our community. Allowing a working mom to fulfill her dreams of being able to show everyone how to love through food.  Inspire the younger generation to be supportive of each other and grow collaboratively.</p>

<p>I'm Karyn Sherwood. It's been a dream of mine to open a costume rental house since I started college as a costumer. Historical costuming was my first love. When I was 11, I got my friends to dress up like peasants and play in the woods behind our houses. It makes sense to start off with Renaissance costumes!</p>
<p>My first job ever was at the PA Renaissance Faire at 16.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518635891/dsd3nt5sk8wt8cvoknaf.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It sparked my interest in professional costuming. Since then I've pursued the costuming profession with a passion, working for professional theatres, production houses, and cruise lines. 5 years ago I found myself back at the faire. It was my pleasure to dress people up at Lady Gwendolyn's and see the fun and joy it brought guests. Sadly, Gwen has closed her doors at the PA faire. (She's still has her full shop in Pitman, NJ and you can find her at the New Jersey Faire.) But for PA, that means there is nowhere to rent a costume on the grounds. <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518636443/xzg1hhpn5xasfze4zhjk.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>With everything Gwen taught me and my experience over the last decade as a costumer, I'm excited to open a new costume rental place on the faire grounds. The timing is perfect to buy a building and I need your help!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>I need to raise $30,000 to get the building and $10,000 to pay fees and create stock for the store</li>
<li>You get to dress up and enjoy your time at the Faire. Some of the perks will be garb made to your size and color preferences and special discounts for multiple visits or for groups.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>To educate and entertain through historical costuming. Not only will I be renting unique garb, but there will also be an historical demonstration of what different classes wore during the renaissance.</li>

</div></div>","I'm Karyn Sherwood. It's been a dream of mine to open a costume rental house since I started college as a costumer. Historical costuming was my first love. When I was 11, I got my friends to dress up like peasants and play in the woods behind our houses. It makes sense to start off with Renaissance costumes!
My first job ever was at the PA Renaissance Faire at 16.
It sparked my interest in professional costuming. Since then I've pursued the costuming profession with a passion, working for professional theatres, production houses, and cruise lines. 5 years ago I found myself back at the faire. It was my pleasure to dress people up at Lady Gwendolyn's and see the fun and joy it brought guests. Sadly, Gwen has closed her doors at the PA faire. (She's still has her full shop in Pitman, NJ and you can find her at the New Jersey Faire.) But for PA, that means there is nowhere to rent a costume on the grounds. 
With everything Gwen taught me and my experience over the last decade as a costumer, I'm excited to open a new costume rental place on the faire grounds. The timing is perfect to buy a building and I need your help!

What We Need & What You Get

I need to raise $30,000 to get the building and $10,000 to pay fees and create stock for the store
You get to dress up and enjoy your time at the Faire. Some of the perks will be garb made to your size and color preferences and special discounts for multiple visits or for groups.


The Impact

To educate and entertain through historical costuming. Not only will I be renting unique garb, but there will also be an historical demonstration of what different classes wore during the renaissance.
I've made plenty of garb for the faire. It's safer to say that these items are clothing and not costumes. The pieces are well structured, durable, and most importantly, comfortable. Dressing up enhances your experience at the faire. You become a part of the shire and not just an observer.
Children can wear a costume without worry of growing out of it.
My current etsy shop is zero waste. All of my scrap fabric is used to make pet beds and toys that I donate to local pet rescues and shelters. I will continue this practice with the scraps from the rentals.

The Challenge
Time could run out on the building's availability. I want to move quickly to make sure I can accomplish everything before the opening of the faire season in August. By moving forward several months out, that gives me time to fully stock the rentals with brand new pieces, decorate the shop, find and create my team of dressers and stitchers, and get all the paperwork in place.

<h3>Ranch's Story</h3>
<p>Ranch Pizza got it's start as a pop-up pizza delivery shop, operating out of rented kitchen space, serving customers at nearby watering holes in SE Portland, OR. What began as an experimental side project between two guys who shared a love of pizza, quickly turned into a thriving business with a great product and a loyal following. Now, in a partnership with Title Bout Restaurant Group, we have signed a lease on a space in the fantastic Woodlawn neighborhood in NE Portland, and are planning for a grand opening in the Spring or early Summer of 2018!</p>
<p>We can't think of a more appropriate means of raising the additional funds we need than from the folks who helped us get here in the first place, and all we want is to bring our pizza to as many people as possible. </p>
<p>Restaurants are expensive to build, license, and operate, which is why we're asking our dedicated fans for some help in the process in exchange for some great perks once we're open. With the money we raise, we'll be able to offer our pizza, salads and sides, along with a great selection of draft beer, wine, and specialty cocktails in a great new (and family friendly) setting, open 7 days-a-week for lunch and dinner.</p>
<p>So far we've raised enough money through loans, and with help from family, to get started on the design, licensing, and early construction phases of the project. The additional funds we raise through this campaign will help us complete construction, purchase a sign, pay for painting and artwork, buy all the equipment we need, purchase inventory and help pay our employees during the opening process. </p>
<p>We really went HARD to make the perks of this campaign attractive to all you Ranch fans. And we really tried to stick to what everyone is in this for to begin with: THE PIZZA! You'll find some very straight forward offers of food and drink, some classic Ranch swag, and also some special discount perks that could really pay off in the end. We're here to show our appreciation, so most of the perks are a better deal than what you might get once we're open for regular business. </p>
<p>We really appreciate you taking the time to check out our campaign, and we're really excited to make this restaurant happen. Check back for our video coming soon for some behind the scenes action. </p>
<p>Also, in the mean time be sure to come by for a taste of our pizza inside the awesome bar, Poison's Rainbow (<a href=""http://www.poisonsrainbow.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.poisonsrainbow.com</a>), designed and owned by Isaac Brock of Modest Mouse! </p>

<h3>Who is Hair Color Art??</h3>
<p>Hello to everyone here reading this and considering contributing to the art side of my Hair Color Art project. </p>
<p>My name is Kristin Dutcher and I have been a professional hairstylist for 18 years. I grew up in Binghamton, New York and this is where I went to beauty school and started my hairstylist journey! After finishing beauty school, I decided to fulfill my dream and move to The Big Apple!! I started working at Dramatics NYC, joined up with DisgraceLand Family Freakshow, and went to art school at FIT! NYC was a huge learning experience and I found out how important it is to surround yourself with people who are smarter than you, more talented than you and keep your mind open and available to new things!</p>
<p>I went from one monumental experiential salon to another at The Electric Chair in San Diego, Ca! While I was working at EC, I was introduced to A Reason To Survive (A.R.T.S.) Arts is a nonprofit art school for at risk youth. It is a place where kids 4-24 could come and escape their reality and dive into art. This place helped the troubled youth find friends, education, freedom and companionship!! </p>
<p>Fast forward 5 years and here I am in Ithaca, New York, doing hair, loving life and ready to wrap it all together! All of these experiences in my life were life changing and I want to take pieces of them all and share them with the Ithaca community! </p>
<p>Hair Color Art is more than a hair salon, it is a place for the community to gather and get their hands dirty! A salon is an environment for conversation, engagement and social interactions. I want to connect all the people of Ithaca to the artists of Ithaca! I want to start a Creative Zone, a space where we all come together and learn, see art, create art and look great doing it!! The most important part of this project is to have it be free! And the best part is You're all invited!! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I need and What you get!!</h3>
<p>I am asking for $7,000 which will help get this project off the ground from day 1!!</p>
<ul>
<li>The first $1,200 will end up going towards campaign fees, taxes and reward purchases.</li>
<li>$$$ will go towards filling the communal supply closet. These supplies include;</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Canvases, Drawing paper, Charcoal Paper, Sketchbooks, etc.</li>
<li>Drawing pencils, charcoals, Oil pastels, acrylic, oil, watercolor paints..</li>
<li>Paintbrushes, jars, towels..</li>
<li>Drawing boards, Easels, chairs, Tables... Etc!!</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>$$ will go towards payment of life drawing models. </li>
<li>$$ will go towards the paint and supplies needed to paint a mandala mural on the ceiling of Hair Color Art.</li>
<li>$$ will go towards miscellaneous supplies for gallery wall maintenance, ie, paint and Spackle, nails, etc.</li>
<li>$$ would be used for the purpose of bringing local made beverages and snack to salon and gallery patrons. </li>
<li>Any leftover funds will enter a savings account to continue to maintain supplies and the experiential events!</li>
</ul>
<p>The benefit to having the supply closet stocked and ready to go, will help create successful community art events starting on day 1. Some of these awesome events I have planned are..</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Life Drawing session</strong> with introductory lesson from guest artist. Community will have the option to sign up and take the class and use the mediums provided at no extra cost!</li>
<li>
<strong>Magazine and book collage party</strong>! With help from participating artist, community will have the ability to cut and paste magazine clippings to create a unique image or design. </li>
<li>
<strong>Illustration art session</strong>! This event will give the community an opportunity to work with local illustrative artists to bring a mini story to life!!</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a couple events planned for the opening year of HCA!! Each month will bring a new artist and each First Friday will bring a new event or party that all are welcome to attend! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact </h3>
<p>Art has been one constant in my life that has been my most valuable asset! Regardless of the outcome, the process of creating art is therapeutic and has gotten me through some rough times. I enjoy galleries and museums, they always inspire me to try something new.</p>
<p>I have taught in multiple art programs, Fall Creek Enrichment Program, Wine and Design in Ithaca, Uncorked Creations is Binghamton and ARTS in Sand Diego. I have attended F.I.T. in NYC for Fine Arts and Mesa College for Art Therapy even though I do not hold degrees in these fields. </p>
<p>Through my time at ARTS, it helped me really connect the idea that art creates an environment where people find comfort and understanding in themselves. It helps children and adults find connections in each other. I worked with kids who were going through some very serious difficulties. Anywhere from family deaths to juvenile hall, but when they got to ARTS all that adult drama seemed to be left at the door. It took coaxing sometimes but after a few visits and dedicated mentors, they had a safe and fun place to unload, relax and create!</p>
<p>While teaching enrichment  at Fall Creek Elementary School, I taught all kinds of classes to kids pre-k through 5th. Some examples are collage, painting, paper mache, drawing, and sculpting. I also taught a themed Harry Potter class that encompassed a variety of mediums and projects. </p>
<p>I recognize that this project is starting on a small scale and inside another business but with your donations, I will be able to provide the materials needed to create this space and allow people to partake at no fee!! While clients receive their hair services they can create art, while clients with small children get their hair done, their children can paint or draw.</p>
<p>I would love to bring creativity to the client and to offer more than just a salon experience. Hair is a way to express yourself creatively and it shouldn't just end there. Hair Color Art is a safe space to be yourself and be as colorful and open as one can be!</p>

<h3>It's what's on the inside that counts and Lil's wants to show you why!!!</h3>
<p><strong>What the HECK is happening?</strong></p>
<p>With some help from you we are hoping to open our doors and bring the magic of Lil's inside!  Once inside we will have an expanded deli, bar and of course places to hang with our favorite people.  No more rain, no more cold, no more bugs... unless you are into that kind of stuff of course.</p>
<p><strong>Wait...how did Lil's get here anyway?</strong></p>
<p>Since 2016, Lil's has been bringing delicious food and community togetherness to Covington, KY.  This journey all started when Julia moved to the Cov from NYC and found herself searching high and low for a GOOD bagel, and eventually began making them herself.  Soon she was selling the bagels at local coffee shops and farmers markets and eventually opened a walk-up Windough at 308 Greenup St.   Lil's is named after Julia's jewish grandmother, Lilian Kessler, whose best dishes were tuna salad and hot dogs, but who was one that taught Julia what a GOOD bagel was.</p>
<p>In the last year, Lil's has grown and transformed, and is no longer just a bagel shop.  During the day, Lil's is a deli where everything is fresh, local and unique, a community fundraiser space, and a meeting space.  In the evenings you can come to Lil's for everything from happy hours, movie nights, trivia and dance parties. With the dedication of our amazing customers, friends, neighbors and team, we believe Lil's has become a community landmark.  </p>
<p><strong>So if Lil's has come this far, why do you need me?</strong></p>
<p>We are a lil’ business. A lil business that has made it this far because of you.  We started in our kitchen, cut our teeth at the farmer’s market, and eventually opened the Windough.  Every step of the way we’ve been fueled by 100% pure Chutzpah and 0% investor dollars.  The next step is the biggest one yet, and with your help we can stay 100% independently owned and community focused.</p>
<p>The thing is, Lil's has become all of this as a simple walk-up Windough.  Now, with your help we are ready to open Lil's doors and bring the hawtness inside.  Through this expansion, Lil's will be able to fully realize it's mission to become a full deli, a diverse and inclusive space, and a community anchor.  We have only gotten this far because of all of you, and ask that you please help us take the next step by donating as little or as much as you can.</p>

<h3>Our Yoga Community</h3>
<p>In September 2019 Crystal Heart Yoga officially opened its doors in Corning, New York. We have been fortunate to watch our community grow together, the teaching staff expand, and our class offerings provide a much needed touchstone in many lives. </p>
<p>Just 6 months after opening we must now temporarily shutter our beloved new studio in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic. We wish for us all to remain connected and remember what awaits us. To keep that dream a reality we have started this campaign, allowing you to back this small, local business--Support Crystal Heart Yoga in Style!  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are in need of the funds to keep our business running while we are unable to use the studio space. Classes must stop for now, but our financial obligations and basic expenses do not.  This is a challenge! I must still cover insurances, taxes on the lease, the lease itself, minimal utilities, and the like. </p>
<p>If you decide to purchase something from the campaign you will support the studio financially right away. You also help to create awareness for the studio when you post pictures of your studio-branded threads and wear them out in the world when we resume our normal activities. Tag us on Instagram with @crystal.heart.yoga!</p>
</div><div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div><div>
<p>Consider sharing this campaign with anyone who likes shirts, yoga, and/or small businesses! Please let others know that they can support the studio by posting on social media or sending them a link. We thank you!</p>
<p>Consider using some of the upcoming pay-what-you-can YouTube videos!</p>
<p>You can also find weekly Live streaming classes on the Crystal Heart Yoga Facebook page, co-hosted with the Southeast Steuben County Library. These will be archived for you to use at any time, (*note, the first class is available on the library's Facebook page) and air at 10a Fridays until the library reopens.  We are also creating a YouTube channel for yoga classes to use from home. </p>
<p>I built this studio as a tribute to the practice of yoga and all its seekers.  This small business was built of heart, time, sweat, sacrifice, and love. I am now only one of many who view our studio as an anchor--as a sanctuary.  We will work to keep it. We need help to ensure it remains a valued resource in Corning. </p>

</div></div>","The founder of Western Alternative Energies is Dan Curfew. Dan has been working on this project for the last 7 years. Dan has a patent on this technology and it was proven by the Department of Energy at the Idaho National Labs. The scientists there could not disprove this technology. They stated that they had never seen anything like this before. Dan has several working prototypes of this product from very small units to what he has developed today. Western Alternative Energies has been invited to participate in the incubator program which is located in the University of Wyoming's building which has the Wyoming Technology Business Center of the Casper Area located inside. 

We have named this campaign and product called THE GRID. There is no other product like this anywhere. The standard size will produce a total of 3.5 Mega Watts of power. The unit has the ability to even power your home. Imagine Clean Power with no emission. Solar panels do produce emissions. THE GRID can now provide you with the power you need anywhere. This can also be used as a backup power source for your home when you lose power, or use it as your main power source and Never worry about power outages again.You can also take this camping, and use this in your camper or RV as it is silent, use it on a job site , power a school. The uses for this is endless. The funding raised here will move this product to the next phase, production. 

We will be able to bring power to any location in the world. This product is eco-friendly , non corrosive, non-explosive, and recyclable. The best part is there is nothing like this in the world, which means no competition. This product can last for months, or years, depending on the load configuration, producing power.

Short Summary
We are Stump City Brewery and we are looking forward to bringing great beer to Fulton County. Our brewers are Nicholas Sherman (Veteran), Matthew Sherman (School Counselor), Jerry Sherman (The Father and Elder) and Casey Oare (Firefighter). We have a passion for beer and local products which is why we are specifically becoming a Farm Brewery that requires us to use a certain amount of New York grain and hops.
Our name comes from the history of leather making in this area. Many trees were cut down before it was known as Gloversville, which led to it being known as Stump City. We also take pride in the leather making history of the area - where earlier in the 20th century 90% of the gloves sold in the U.S. came from Gloversville.

We are looking to raise this money because, as many of you know, in starting a small business we have a tight budget. We want to bring as many varieties of beer as we can to you and to do that we need  a little hard work and some more gear. New fermentors and other equipment will allow us to increase our capacity and to make specialty beers that take longer than typical beers to age.
We intend to succeed, but we want to flourish and upgrade to better serve you. This is where you come in. Small boosts in funding that increase our capacity or help make brewing more efficient are huge for us.
What We Need & What You Get
The funding that we are trying to raise is going directly to equipment that will increase our capacity (fermentors) and efficiency (bigger pumps, better burners). As you may already know, we are a small operation to start with, so every little bit counts.
Our swag (perks) will allow you to show off your local pride in us and in small businesses. We know this is important to both you and to us so we will be purchasing everything as local as possible.
If we don’t reach our goal we will still be putting the money towards as many improvements as the amount will allow us. It will not go to waste!

<h3>What is <i>Toum</i>?</h3>
<p>""Toum"" literally means garlic in Arabic. It is also referred to as a popular garlic condiment used in the Middle-East for delicious foods such a shish-kabobs and shawerma sandwiches. It is naturally vegan and gluten free.</p>
<p><i>Toum</i> was introduced to me by my father, a Jordanian immigrant, who has perfected the challenging technique in making this.Through him I have gained much of my culinary passion and have decided to begin my food line ""OneRootFoods"" by using his recipe as my flagship product, to honor the father who has sacrificed so much to see me realize my dream.</p>
<p>OneRootFoods will eventually include various self-made and family recipes, and a portion of each future sale will go to food justice charities in the Pacific Northwest. </p>
<p>Along with the original, I have also created 2 variations. For anyone who loves a little spice and heat, <i>Toum+Harissa </i>is a perfect blend of garlic and homemade Harissa (a North African chili paste). Or maybe something more refreshing, <i>Toum+Herb </i>is made with a refreshing blend of fresh basil, tarragon and mint.</p>
<p>As you might guess, starting a business is neither easy or cheap but your contribution will help cover the start-up costs, everything from license fees to production to shipping and gives an alternative to bank loans where the interest rates would become a debilitating obstacle.</p>
<p>OneRootFoods will introduce the amazing product<i> Toum</i> to various household kitchens in the Pacific NorthWest and beyond! People will discover the many delicious ways it can be applied to their favorite foods!</p>
<h3><strong>What is in <i>Toum</i> and what can it be used for?</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>The classic <i>Toum </i>only consists of 4 ingredients: fresh organic garlic, oil, lemon juice and salt</li>
<li>
<i>Toum </i>is completely vegan, gluten free, all natural and free of major food allergens</li>
<li>Along with common Middle Eastern dishes, it's a great addition to sandwiches, burgers, dipping sauces, grilled fish, fried chicken, tacos, pasta, BBQ's....</li>
<li>Almost anything you are willing to try it with! Be deliciously creative!</li>
<li>Consider it a substitute or enhancer for mayo to start</li>
<li>Sample recipe: Soy Sauce and Chili Marinated Tofu Tacos; cabbage, lettuce, mint leaves and of course Toum!</li>

<p><strong>November and December:</strong><br/>•    More and more planting<br/>•    Coffee seedlings will go in soon<br/>•    vegetable garden will be cleaned and readied for planting<br/>•    natural water to the site will be restored to the site<br/>•    Location of the large scale waste treatment will be finalized(our philosophy is: the only thing that leave the site is food)<br/>•    The funds will be used to allow construction of 2 accommodation villas.The accommodation villas in the future will help provide income to the land and will help support local employment and training.<br/>•    The current plan is to construct 6 villas in total 2 per year with the first being available from june/july 2017.</p>
<p><br/>•    This accommodation will be unique in design complete solar and waste water recovery to be used on farm irrigation but allows for all modern comforts and will sleep upto 4 people.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Some of our challenges </p>
<p>Skilled labour - we want local input in construction beyond just labourers, our design allows for welding(a lot of welding and we would like as a part of our process to afford to send at least one local person to complete his welding craft certification under the eye of our head contractor(that will be will be a requirement of the construction contract.this could lead to at least some qualified trade welders.</p>

</div><div><p> </p></div></div>","Master Plan 
We want this place to be rejuvenated small farm with accommodation for people to come and enjoy, we will also be giving employment to the local area during construction,farming and tourist roles as we progress...things  we need to happen
•    Clean and rejuvenate the jungle areas which have been cleared•    Clean up beach dumping,restore and support cliff and mangrove beach line•    Establish Coconut/cocoa/Pili/coffee/Mahogany planting management plan including seedling distribution•    Establishment of vegetable garden to provide for accommodation and locals for•    Construct temporary dwelling as base of operation•    Construct temporary access road into site•    Construct Aerobic waste water system and filtration•    Construct renewable energy station for power•    Construct permanent fence•    Construct holiday accommodation for travelers to the area 
Current Status
August:
Construction of temp road has been completed! Comprising of a construction crew of 10 local men to hand cut the temporary road in by hand due the the initial steep entrance,taking under to weeks to construct the team enjoyed a BBQ to celebrate the completion of that phase.
before:
After:September: •    Temporary building constructed ..hooray... made completely from local materials  (well except the cement - that came from the Mayon) this type of hut is commonly referred as a Nipa style hut•    Measuring 6 mtrs x 6 mtrs will be comfortable for the meantime during further construct out house and shower are a separate structure utilizing rain water for showering and advanced composing for solid waste.
Hut construction:Accommodation:•    planned designed are being drawn up as we speak for sign off by the municipal government....awaiting that permit....sneak peak of design and possibilities?

Planting:•    Arriving this month has been 150 coconut seedling standing on average 3 feet these will be used to back plant where all of the coconut was logged as well as future planting across the top of the land.The coconut will allow the future inter-planting of the cocoa
•    Also this month 30 of the new sprouted mahogany seedling will be planted with another 100+ due to sprout soon.•    the seedling bank will grow into further natives species as we develop.We have also had other seedlings such as pomello and avocado sprout

November and December:•    More and more planting•    Coffee seedlings will go in soon•    vegetable garden will be cleaned and readied for planting•    natural water to the site will be restored to the site•    Location of the large scale waste treatment will be finalized(our philosophy is: the only thing that leave the site is food)•    The funds will be used to allow construction of 2 accommodation villas.The accommodation villas in the future will help provide income to the land and will help support local employment and training.•    The current plan is to construct 6 villas in total 2 per year with the first being available from june/july 2017.
•    This accommodation will be unique in design complete solar and waste water recovery to be used on farm irrigation but allows for all modern comforts and will sleep upto 4 people.
 
Some of our challenges 
Skilled labour - we want local input in construction beyond just labourers, our design allows for welding(a lot of welding and we would like as a part of our process to afford to send at least one local person to complete his welding craft certification under the eye of our head contractor(that will be will be a requirement of the construction contract.this could lead to at least some qualified trade welders.
Material - Being at the southern end of Luzon material for construction does come at a premium some of the design can be pre-fabricated closer to manila and shipped to us,risks could include if design is'nt adheared too - signed of design will be the key and cost of construction should reduce with this method.
Time - Everything takes time in the phillipines and sometime in triple copy,We really need support in our venture and we believe we have a realistic time frame based on the pre work and design already completed. But everyone watching our project will see our passion in providing not just accomodation but rehabilition and safe farming practises, to give everyone that visits an opportunity to learn or participate.
One - Money, it helps in so many ways, we want people to enjoy donating as much as what we can offer...its a bueatiful place that should be shared but in a responsible way that our aim...every dollar is tracked and reported every piece of help and support is appriecated.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

My name is Josh and I am the founder of Impact Fuel and the Sponsored Rider Club. My passion for powersports and helping others has manifested into these two projects:


Impact Fuel - My goal here is to transform the riding experience into sponsor-funded charitable donations (i.e. make every ride impactful). Check out impactfuel.org.

Sponsored Rider Club - The vision is to create a community for riders and racers to learn how to best market themselves in order to build strong, lasting, and successful relationships with sponsors. The target market for this club is ATV, UTV, motocross, and snocross racers along with backcountry snomobilers.

Bring to life the challenges successful riders have overcome.
Highlight and promote best practices.
Outline specifics to define and hone in personal marketing strategies.
Motivate and inspire riders/racers to build the confidence to DOMINATE their dreams.

If I don't reach my entire funding goal, I will be selling one of my less critical organs (or taking out a small business loan) to cover the remaining costs. I WILL BE DOING THIS PODCAST THOUGH (just maybe with one less kidney).

The Impact
Look. Riders and racers are successful because they are smart, dedicated, and athletically superior to normal human beings (like myself). However, they still need help. It is very scary and confusing for riders to put themselves out there and ask for support from others (trust me, I can relate).
I truly believe I can remove some of the fear and anxiety for racers seeking sponsorship opportunities by creating an open forum to discuss the best practices, and dive into and debunk the fears.
I have interviewed hundreds of people in my career, and I excel at coaching. Help me bring my skill set into the powersports industry so that these riders can become the best version of themselves.

Risks & Challenges
Let's be honest, starting a podcast has some risk involved. First off, it could suck. Second off, it could be great, and maybe nobody listens to it because I don't market it properly.
What if someone does listen to it though. What if just one person hears a success story, and that person learns a tip or changes their mindset, which ultimately leads to them taking the next big step in becoming the successful rider they have always dreamed of becoming. Yep...those are called chills, you know, the ones that are running down the back of your neck right now.
With the following I have built so far on Impact Fuel's social media (via Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, and Snapchat) and the Sponsored Rider Club, along with the amazing people I have networked with in the powersports industry, I feel confident that I can overcome these challenges and make a true impact on people's lives

<h3><strong>2015</strong></h3>
<p>To save the original project a few people stayed and together with the lovers of this magical land went on with the ‘Solar United Natives’ project, which is more than a festival: a healing ‘new-conscious’ community gathering. Fruit trees were planted, a community garden and kitchen were made, and a limited number private event was held with only 1,000 visitors.

<li><p>We want to be the most reliable and trusted site for vehicle owners to obtain basic and critical automotive knowledge. We want to do this by giving our customers exclusive access to future automotive gadgets, tips, and how-to videos while also giving them the opportunity to customize their very own emergency kits based on their unique environment and needs. Such kits could include items like a hot meal maker, cool packs, emergency first aid, a no-connect phone charger and much more.</p></li>
<li>We also want to build an app that will send alerts about routine maintenance and recalls and other general tips for your vehicle.<br/> </li>
<li>The most important goal, however, is to continue making a difference for our customers, the charities we love and the great people who work with us. We treat the people who work with us and our customers like family!<br/> </li>
</ol><h3>Risks and Challenges</h3><p>Our greatest challenge will be in gathering all of the required automotive data as we grow. We have lined up a couple of resources for reliable manufacturer’s information, but we will always need to do a second (and sometimes third) check to verify that all of the information stays correct and up-to-date.</p><p>We do expect some speed bumps as we seek to convey the value of Carmine to everyone with a vehicle, particularly women. Our goal is to provide the necessary knowledge needed for vehicle owners to make informed decisions that will preserve the health of their vehicles.</p><p>Regardless of the challenges, I am confident we will bring to life a great product to fill a worldwide need.</p><p>We started the QuickTrick portable tools line in our garage and now service 3 of the top 5 fleet vehicle owners in the US and have customers all the way from hot rodders and racers, to custom car builders, fleets, the military and school bus departments.

Pam Oakes

Pam Oakes was born in the automotive mecca of the world -- Detroit, Michigan and spent her teen years on Florida's southwest coast. Pam is a fourth generation auto technician: Her great-grandfather Leonard Smith, grandfather Ralph Smith and father Jerry Oakes were all automotive technicians. As a matter of fact, Pam's first auto lesson was from her great-grandfather, Leonard. He showed her how to set the choke on his 1969 Plymouth -- a vehicle she has restored and has sitting in her garage, today.
Pam started Pam's Motor City Automotive and Tires in 1995 and retired in 2015. Pam is a major advocate for car care and education to women and men everywhere.

Most men don’t blink twice before changing a flat tire, replacing a headlight, replacing wiper blades or simply checking basic fluids and preventative maintenance.
 Most women shy away from any hands-on or DIY approach. The challenges are many​ 

the need for proper car maintenance
road side breakdown
inflated auto repairs bills...

When you lack knowledge about your car, it adds to your woes.
 
  

 

Carmine is your own customized organizer with all of your vehicle vitals in one place along with some basic safety tools.
Carmine gives you the power of knowledge and preparedness for your personal needs.
Carmine is manufactured by Alignment Simple Solutions, the parent company of QuickTrick.
 There is nothing wrong with not wanting to ""Do it Yourself"". If you are like me, the problem comes when I have to trust someone else to ""advise"" me on what my car needs or doesn't need.Knowledge is key and along with that comes the desire to be prepared for the most common, but inevitable, situations that can happen.Tess Winningham,Founder of Carmine
CEO, Alignment Simple SolutionsMakers of the QuickTrick Wheel Alignment Systems
          Our crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo is aimed at not only raising the funds to make the Carmine dream a reality. We aim to reach every woman driver and make her feel empowered, safe and confident! We value the time you have taken reading it and will keep you informed about all updates happening on our Carmine Crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo. We invite your feedback and eagerly await your response and suggestions! With your support, we can help change the way women understand their cars and eliminate the frustrations that accompany car maintenance! If you are unable to contribute monetarily, you can still help us: Spread the word around by sharing our campaign on your social networking accounts.    Carmine is not a text book on how to be your own personal mechanic. Carmine is meant to give you the power of knowledge and preparedness for your personal needs. It is like having a personal mechanic in your glove box.We aren’t looking to make you a Master Mechanic!Let's eliminate the frustration, fear, shame, and anxiety that can go hand in hand with car care. 

 
There is NO One Carmine for Every Car!Each and Every Carmine is personalized according to the year, make and model of your unique vehicle.The information below serves as a basic outline of the essential things you must know to save money, to stay safe and to take care of your investment:
Recommended tire pressure
Recommended fluids & where they go Illustrated for your specific engine- Oil- Coolant- Transmission- Fluid- Brake Fluid v. Wiper Fluid 
Manufacturer’s recommended Wheel Alignment Specifications
Slot for your Registration
Slot for your Insurance Card

Carmine helps you be an informed, savvy woman driver who knows her car inside out. Safeguard yourself against the unscrupulous auto mechanic with Carmine by your side. You know your car best!You can know the basics of routine car maintenance and what you have to do to make sure your cars last.It’s reassuring to know that my car is as prepared as I am to hit the road, whether we’re off to work, heading on a vacation or just taking a leisurely cruise on the weekend! Every year I take our alignment systems on a comparison test to ensure our accuracy against the largest alignment franchises in the country. I routinely get treated like I have no understanding of what my cars need and I frequently get asked to pay for repairs or fluids that I don't need.We have seen the horror stories on 20/20 and elsewhere that reveal the unethical practice of price gouging, which is especially common when the customers are women.When you are on the road alone, be in charge of your car.Carmine ensures you are safe and prepared.Don't get me wrong though. The majority of shops are filled with good people. I have many friends in the industry who are providing a service above and beyond what is normally expected. It is frustrating to not know the basic needs for our vehicles or WHERE to find them. I prefer to have an understanding of things I care about, and believe me, I love my cars and want them to last.Our factory in Alabama Carmine is the latest offering from Alignment Simple Solutions, the reliable and trusted entrepreneurial venture based in Alabama, United States and makers of the QuickTrick brand of wheel alignment solutions. 

 
We have been greatly appreciated by our customers We are a Certified Member of Our Products are also Available at these Retailers We Support Martin Truex Jr. Foundation5% of all our profits go to Martin Truex Jr. Foundation, which is enriching the lives of those afflicted with Childhood and Ovarian Cancers and is striving to better the lives of women and children fighting the fight, every single day.  Tess Winningham, CEO & Co Founder receiving the 2014Global Media Award for the QuickTrick Fleet System.  Stretch Goals
We want to be the most reliable and trusted site for vehicle owners to obtain basic and critical automotive knowledge. We want to do this by giving our customers exclusive access to future automotive gadgets, tips, and how-to videos while also giving them the opportunity to customize their very own emergency kits based on their unique environment and needs. Such kits could include items like a hot meal maker, cool packs, emergency first aid, a no-connect phone charger and much more.
We also want to build an app that will send alerts about routine maintenance and recalls and other general tips for your vehicle. 
The most important goal, however, is to continue making a difference for our customers, the charities we love and the great people who work with us. We treat the people who work with us and our customers like family! 
Risks and ChallengesOur greatest challenge will be in gathering all of the required automotive data as we grow. We have lined up a couple of resources for reliable manufacturer’s information, but we will always need to do a second (and sometimes third) check to verify that all of the information stays correct and up-to-date.We do expect some speed bumps as we seek to convey the value of Carmine to everyone with a vehicle, particularly women. Our goal is to provide the necessary knowledge needed for vehicle owners to make informed decisions that will preserve the health of their vehicles.Regardless of the challenges, I am confident we will bring to life a great product to fill a worldwide need.We started the QuickTrick portable tools line in our garage and now service 3 of the top 5 fleet vehicle owners in the US and have customers all the way from hot rodders and racers, to custom car builders, fleets, the military and school bus departments. QuickTrick family can now be found in over 105 Countries.We want to apply that same success to Carmine with your help!Thank you so much!!Tess WinninghamFounder of CarmineCEO, Alignment Simple SolutionsMakers of the QuickTrick Wheel Alignment Systems",56.0,5,"1 Campaign

The mighty Falls Church News-Press has been fighting to good fight on behalf of the suburban D.C. community it serves and also on behalf of important progressive causes for over 25 years.</p>
<p>The Falls Church News-Press has been an indispensable leader in not only shaping opinion in the nation's capital by being welcomed into the households of thousands of movers and shakers working in the most powerful city in the world, but also by swaying the popular vote in Virginia statewide elections with all but one candidate (all Democrats) it has endorsed in statewide races since 2000 winning, often by margins of victory provided in its unique distribution area, and turning the state from bright red to purple and soon deep blue. It is the recipient of many awards and accolades, being named “Business of the Year' multiple times by the Falls Church City Council and its owner-editor Nicholas Benton being named “Business Person of the Year.” twice winning the Falls Church Chamber of Commerce's “Pillar of the Community” award and the statewide Equality Virginia's esteemed “OUTstanding Virginian” award.</p>

<p>Blush &amp; Whimsy was founded in early 2016 to create products that bring fairy tales to life. As a startup out of <strong>Albuquerque, New Mexico</strong>, we are expanding our luxury cosmetics fabrication and seeking to provide skilled jobs. Our initial product line uses our exclusive LipGlass technology to capture real flowers, and the formula changes color based on your body's unique pH and temperature of your skin. </p>
<p><strong>We need your help!</strong> The interest in our products has been tremendous, and we are rapidly growing our inventory to meet the demand. </p>

<h3>Micaela Brown</h3>
<p>Three years ago, I took the leap into the startup space challenging myself to find ways to create extraordinary experiences from ordinary reality. I believe that magic shouldn't only be for the movies, and I've found a way to bring elements of magic into everyday life. My passion for creating spectacular experiences evolved from events to items that we use every day. For the past year, I have meticulously worked on formulations and product design to bring you the first of (what I hope to be) many new product lines!</p>
<p>And now, we need your help—to make  things that were once ordinary into the most extraordinary items you've ever seen!  We appreciate your support and everything you can do to help spread the word and get people as excited and passionate about Blush &amp; Whimsy as we are. </p>
<p>Thank you so much,<br/>The Blush &amp; Whimsy team </p>

<p>Blush &amp; Whimsy cosmetics are made with the finest ingredients. In this first product line, each lipstick has the same reaction to your skin, creating the same color regardless of flower color. </p>

<p>Inventory is critical at the startup level, and 100% of the funds raised from this campaign will go towards funding our first production run and creating product to meet demand.

</div></div>","Blush & Whimsy was founded in early 2016 to create products that bring fairy tales to life. As a startup out of Albuquerque, New Mexico, we are expanding our luxury cosmetics fabrication and seeking to provide skilled jobs. Our initial product line uses our exclusive LipGlass technology to capture real flowers, and the formula changes color based on your body's unique pH and temperature of your skin. 
We need your help! The interest in our products has been tremendous, and we are rapidly growing our inventory to meet the demand. 
To learn more about Blush & Whimsy continue reading below.


Micaela Brown
Three years ago, I took the leap into the startup space challenging myself to find ways to create extraordinary experiences from ordinary reality. I believe that magic shouldn't only be for the movies, and I've found a way to bring elements of magic into everyday life. My passion for creating spectacular experiences evolved from events to items that we use every day. For the past year, I have meticulously worked on formulations and product design to bring you the first of (what I hope to be) many new product lines!
And now, we need your help—to make  things that were once ordinary into the most extraordinary items you've ever seen!  We appreciate your support and everything you can do to help spread the word and get people as excited and passionate about Blush & Whimsy as we are. 
Thank you so much,The Blush & Whimsy team 
P.S. Mr. Paws Barkley, the chihuahua, likes to come to work with Micaela
 
First Product Line

Blush & Whimsy cosmetics are made with the finest ingredients. In this first product line, each lipstick has the same reaction to your skin, creating the same color regardless of flower color. 
What it Looks Like
We teamed up with Nyika Allen of NyikaTV to show you what it looks like on! 

Inventory is critical at the startup level, and 100% of the funds raised from this campaign will go towards funding our first production run and creating product to meet demand. Any additional funds (over our goal) will be used to increase staffing for manufacturing, packaging, and setting up distribution.
Inventory 100%

<p>Not only will you benefit from having a new and exciting alternative to the tired old traditional pub, but we are offering some exclusive perks just for donating.

Our classes and workshops will range from women with high-stress jobs to women who choose not to work, local and national women’s organizations, bridal parties, corporations doing team-building exercises, and even fundraising organizations. What EXACTLY am I signing up for when I purchase a MEMBERSHIP perk?Technically, nothing! You aren't committing to a contract and you don't have to sign a lease. You are simply donating to our startup costs and, in return, receiving a gift of membership as a thank you. We will send you a link to get registered in our system, choose your membership start date and agree to our terms. At the end of your ""perk,"" you can choose to remain a member (and we're sure you will!). When will Pastel officially open?We are currently planning to open in May 2017 however construction timing may add a delay. We will open no later than August. Are men allowed in the space?We get this question a lot. Although our focus in on empowering women, Pastel, LLC, does not discriminate by gender and will accept memberships and workshop registrations from both men and women. Men (and women) who are non-members are allowed in the space during normal business hours for meetings only. They must be in a designated meeting area or private office and they must be accompanied by a Pastel member. Men (and women) who are non-members are also allowed in the space for after-hours workshops and when it is being rented for private events. Do you foresee any risks or challenges?We have plans in place for construction, materials and funding. However, a lot is going to happen between now and May and construction delays may delay the delivery of your perk. If this happens, we will let you know right away. How can I help without spending any money?Even if you can't contribute, that doesn't mean that you can't help.Help us spread the word by:

<p>Food brings people together; it’s a powerful common denominator across cultures, ages, and places. We find it ironic, then, that while food connects all of us, we are disconnected from our food. By the time most produce reaches our plates, it’s traveled hundreds of miles, lost half its nutritional value, and wasted valuable natural resources. While we import billions of dollars of produce each year, vacant land and buildings across our cities lay fallow. Roots Up sees these spaces as opportunities for growth - food growth, economic growth, and community growth. We envision a network of hyperlocal food systems that bring us all closer to our food and each other; food systems that use less, produce more, and create community. YOU can help us make that happen.</p>
<p></p>

<br/> </div> <div> <h3></h3>
<h3>Our Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Roots Up is a social enterprise founded on a triple bottom line: <b>people, planet, and product</b>. We are committed to creating sustainable food systems that grow more than just food. </p>
<h4>PEOPLE</h4>
<p>Roots Up Systems will be installed in low-income urban communities, creating new jobs and economic growth. Our employees, local residents, will be paid a living wage. In partnership with local agencies and nonprofits, we will create a workforce development program to provide employees with resources and training to support their personal and professional growth.</p>
<p>To become a truly integrated part of our communities, Roots Up will meet regularly with local neighborhood associations. We will be a helpful partner in addressing local food needs - donating food and creating educational programming and community-building opportunities where they’re wanted.</p>
<h4>PLANET</h4>
<p>Compared to traditional farming and watering methods, our compact hydroponic system saves precious water, eliminates erratic weather impacts, and protects against pests, weeds, and disease.</p>
<p>Phase 2 of our system will incorporate solar panels and rain collection systems to continue our aspirations of fully-enclosed, self-sufficient systems. Our team of engineers and experts will continuously improve our systems and create solutions for better food systems. Most importantly, we will always strive to be a successful social enterprise that reinvests our profits to positively impact the wellbeing of our communities and the global food system.</p>
<h4>PRODUCT</h4>
<p>Roots Up produce will be grown without pesticides and delivered the day it's harvested, ensuring maximum nutritional value and taste. Our system will grow year-round, which means we can sell consistent yields at fixed prices.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Our Goals</h3>
<ul> </ul>
<div>
<p>Our campaign has three fundraising goals, each of which will help us build and test our first complete system AND provide food to hungry families. The more money we raise, the more food we can grow and donate!</p>
<br/><h4>GOAL 1: ROOTS UP PILOT ($20,000)</h4>
<p>We need $20,000 to bring a full pilot to life. The pilot, located in Franklinton, will prove our methods by creating <b>a test site for new ideas and supply fresh produce to local families</b>. 100% of all produce will be donated to community members.</p>
<p>$20,000 will fund the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Four 8' x 8' growing walls, complete with moveable shelves, growing pods, and seeds.</p></li>
<li><p>Lights + water + nutrients and the systems to distribute them</p></li>
<li><p>Control hardware and software integration with the mobile app</p></li>
<li><p>System testing, data collection, and improvements</p></li>
<li><p><b>Over one-half ton of fresh, healthy food for local families</b> (20 pounds of spinach and lettuce each week for a year)</p></li>
</ul>
<br/><h4>GOAL 2: ROOTS UP POD ($50,000)</h4>
<p>If we reach our second goal, we will build out a 40-foot shipping container to show how our system maximizes growth in any space.  In a Roots Up Pod (8’ x 40’), we can <b>grow 1/2 to 1 acre of greens</b>, depending on the crop. With all produce grown and shared locally, <b>we can feed 4 times more families than the pilot</b>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1447366150/wvsa9yueeg9cwh96fnfy.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><h4>GOAL 3: ROOTS UP MICROFARM ($250,000)</h4>
<p>For the greatest impact on our local food system and community, we would use $250,000 to create a MicroFarm of shipping containers on a vacant city lot. This construction would decrease total operation costs and increase production: six 40-foot Pods on a MicroFarm will produce <b>over 100,000 pounds of food and create two full-time, living wage jobs</b>. </p>

</div></div>","Our Purpose
 
Roots Up is a hyperlocal food system solution. We believe there are better ways to grow, harvest, and deliver food. And we believe everyone deserves fresh, healthy food.





Food brings people together; it’s a powerful common denominator across cultures, ages, and places. We find it ironic, then, that while food connects all of us, we are disconnected from our food. By the time most produce reaches our plates, it’s traveled hundreds of miles, lost half its nutritional value, and wasted valuable natural resources. While we import billions of dollars of produce each year, vacant land and buildings across our cities lay fallow. Roots Up sees these spaces as opportunities for growth - food growth, economic growth, and community growth. We envision a network of hyperlocal food systems that bring us all closer to our food and each other; food systems that use less, produce more, and create community. YOU can help us make that happen.

Our System

We use engineering and technology to responsibly grow high yield pesticide-free produce in any space.
Our patented TrueVertical system consistently grows leafy greens and herbs year-round. We use heirloom seeds and sustainable practices to grow produce that is delivered within hours of harvest with maximum nutritional value.



The Roots Up System consists of compact, moveable vertical shelves with integrated lights, water, and nutrients. Perfect growing conditions are maintained by proprietary software and a mobile app that allows for remote monitoring and management.

We are working with Philips Horticulture LED Solutions to create the best growing conditions for our produce. Integrating this technology into our system will help us grow, sell, and donate the freshest, healthiest produce possible.


   
Our Impact

Roots Up is a social enterprise founded on a triple bottom line: people, planet, and product. We are committed to creating sustainable food systems that grow more than just food. 
PEOPLE
Roots Up Systems will be installed in low-income urban communities, creating new jobs and economic growth. Our employees, local residents, will be paid a living wage. In partnership with local agencies and nonprofits, we will create a workforce development program to provide employees with resources and training to support their personal and professional growth.
To become a truly integrated part of our communities, Roots Up will meet regularly with local neighborhood associations. We will be a helpful partner in addressing local food needs - donating food and creating educational programming and community-building opportunities where they’re wanted.
PLANET
Compared to traditional farming and watering methods, our compact hydroponic system saves precious water, eliminates erratic weather impacts, and protects against pests, weeds, and disease.
Phase 2 of our system will incorporate solar panels and rain collection systems to continue our aspirations of fully-enclosed, self-sufficient systems. Our team of engineers and experts will continuously improve our systems and create solutions for better food systems. Most importantly, we will always strive to be a successful social enterprise that reinvests our profits to positively impact the wellbeing of our communities and the global food system.
PRODUCT
Roots Up produce will be grown without pesticides and delivered the day it's harvested, ensuring maximum nutritional value and taste. Our system will grow year-round, which means we can sell consistent yields at fixed prices.

Our Goals
 

Our campaign has three fundraising goals, each of which will help us build and test our first complete system AND provide food to hungry families. The more money we raise, the more food we can grow and donate!
GOAL 1: ROOTS UP PILOT ($20,000)
We need $20,000 to bring a full pilot to life. The pilot, located in Franklinton, will prove our methods by creating a test site for new ideas and supply fresh produce to local families. 100% of all produce will be donated to community members.
$20,000 will fund the following:

Four 8' x 8' growing walls, complete with moveable shelves, growing pods, and seeds.
Lights + water + nutrients and the systems to distribute them
Control hardware and software integration with the mobile app
System testing, data collection, and improvements
Over one-half ton of fresh, healthy food for local families (20 pounds of spinach and lettuce each week for a year)

GOAL 2: ROOTS UP POD ($50,000)
If we reach our second goal, we will build out a 40-foot shipping container to show how our system maximizes growth in any space.  In a Roots Up Pod (8’ x 40’), we can grow 1/2 to 1 acre of greens, depending on the crop. With all produce grown and shared locally, we can feed 4 times more families than the pilot.

GOAL 3: ROOTS UP MICROFARM ($250,000)
For the greatest impact on our local food system and community, we would use $250,000 to create a MicroFarm of shipping containers on a vacant city lot. This construction would decrease total operation costs and increase production: six 40-foot Pods on a MicroFarm will produce over 100,000 pounds of food and create two full-time, living wage jobs. 





 
Our Team
Roots Up is a team effort. We have experience and skills from a wide range of backgrounds: startup business, sales & marketing, nonprofit, civil & industrial engineering, software development, and the agriculture and food industries. We come with different perspectives, but the same values:


Put people first.
 Do more than expected.
 Collaborate.
 Pursue growth.
 Consider the impact.


Together, we're committed to creating solutions for food systems that are better for our health, our communities, and our world.
   A huge thank you to everyone who has supported, advised, partnered with, and inspired us on this journey. We are confident that our design, creative use of technology, and local partnerships will add to a more sustainable future for communities across the country and around the world.  We have a lot of work ahead of us, but we are already doing good and are excited for what’s to come!

<h3><b>What We Need to Complete Our Project</b></h3>
<p>Shift
Design is made up of students and practicing professionals that believe in
sustainable development. We are at the start of our professional careers,
equipped with high-quality education and experience BUT we need to appeal for
financial assistance from YOU. </p>
<p>The funds
raised by this campaign will go directly towards the completion of the
non-profit Kasirwa arts village community building. </p>
<p><b>General
Costs</b></p>
<p>The
brief, set by Nka Foundation, was for an affordable, sustainable earth
building. Because this involves the extraction of local materials at
little or no cost we are able to produce a building that can be produced for
roughly $6000 USD. This means that communities using our techniques and design
will be able to achieve similar practical and beautiful results.</p>
<p>Payment
of local craftspeople will offer employment in an environment that encourages
the development of creative construction techniques and leadership
skills. </p>
<p>To
improve earth's reputation as a modern building material, contemporary water
and electrical systems are a necessary feature of the design. </p>
<p>As a

<h3><b>The Impact</b></h3>
<p>Long
after we have left Tanzania, we want Kasirwa to thrive as a centre for the
development of human capital through arts and architecture. We want to ensure
that whatever is built is respectful and is actually desired from the local
residents. </p>
<p>Expert
contribution to the workshop from industry professionals and academics will
help to ensure that the final design is seismically secure and safe. Local
collaboration will confirm that the design is suited to local needs, that
community members feel they have a stake in the success of the project, and
that knowledge of construction techniques remains in the community once the
project is complete.</p>
<p>Continual
research and documentation throughout the workshop is essential so that our
work can reach out and contribute to international concerns with sustainable
urbanism, intelligent use of resources, and safe and sophisticated earthquake
design. In achieving these aims, our workshop formatted project will address
the problems and solutions essential to our aims. Namely, the advancement of
 equitable, happier, healthier and more sustainable livelihoods through
local design with broader outreach.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></h3>
<p>We have
been working tirelessly over the past year and a half whilst earning our
degrees to get to where we are today. Some challenging but manageable factors
naturally will arise in the process of carrying out this non-profit project.</p>
<p>As
students, we lack the finances to support ourselves completely during this
project. However, our personal involvement in this project is essential to its
success. We have therefore factored costs of volunteering ourselves in the
project to our fundraising campaign.</p>
<p>Where our
experience as students may not be as complete as that of practitioners, we have
a vibrant, international and dedicated network of academic, commercial and
governmental experts assisting us with a wide and choice variety of knowledge.</p>
<p>Unforeseen
events and challenges are characteristic of construction projects. For this
reason, our fundraising budget accounts for the contingencies which will most
likely occur over the course of our project. </p>
<p>Spreading
the knowledge gained from our experiences is a major aim of ours. But sometimes
administrative costs such as printing and distribution can stand in the way.
For these reasons, we intend to develop a virtual and open-source collection of
data and research that is cheap to produce and accessible to all.</p><h3>Sponsored By</h3><div>

workshop. However, as students, our financial circumstances mean that we
require your assistance in achieving this.
Extra
funds will go towards project participation costs, which is why we have aimed
so high - to help everyone get involved, particularly people from around the
African continent.

The Impact
Long
after we have left Tanzania, we want Kasirwa to thrive as a centre for the
development of human capital through arts and architecture. We want to ensure
that whatever is built is respectful and is actually desired from the local
residents. 
Expert
contribution to the workshop from industry professionals and academics will
help to ensure that the final design is seismically secure and safe. Local
collaboration will confirm that the design is suited to local needs, that
community members feel they have a stake in the success of the project, and
that knowledge of construction techniques remains in the community once the
project is complete.
Continual
research and documentation throughout the workshop is essential so that our
work can reach out and contribute to international concerns with sustainable
urbanism, intelligent use of resources, and safe and sophisticated earthquake
design. In achieving these aims, our workshop formatted project will address
the problems and solutions essential to our aims. Namely, the advancement of
 equitable, happier, healthier and more sustainable livelihoods through
local design with broader outreach.

Risks & Challenges
We have
been working tirelessly over the past year and a half whilst earning our
degrees to get to where we are today. Some challenging but manageable factors
naturally will arise in the process of carrying out this non-profit project.
As
students, we lack the finances to support ourselves completely during this
project. However, our personal involvement in this project is essential to its
success. We have therefore factored costs of volunteering ourselves in the
project to our fundraising campaign.
Where our
experience as students may not be as complete as that of practitioners, we have
a vibrant, international and dedicated network of academic, commercial and
governmental experts assisting us with a wide and choice variety of knowledge.
Unforeseen
events and challenges are characteristic of construction projects. For this
reason, our fundraising budget accounts for the contingencies which will most
likely occur over the course of our project. 
Spreading
the knowledge gained from our experiences is a major aim of ours. But sometimes
administrative costs such as printing and distribution can stand in the way.
For these reasons, we intend to develop a virtual and open-source collection of
data and research that is cheap to produce and accessible to all.Sponsored By

<div>It's time to help local legend Tiffanie Boldizsar spread her wings, and start her own business!</div>
<div>Years ago, Tiffanie moved here from the East Coast. Since then she has established herself as a cornerstone of the local community. She is a published chef, and a whiz in the kitchen, with years of management experience in food service. Recently, her back has become a serious health concern for her, and she needs a way to provide for her family that doesn't hurt her.  </div>
<div>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Plan</h3>
<div>Transform an old truck into a community focused organic coffee truck, and help a single mother start her own business.</div>
</div>
<div>She has given us so much love, companionship, and delicious food over the years, please help us give some back to Tiffanie!</div> </div> <div> <h3></h3>

<h3>What We Need</h3>

She has also paired with local roasters: <a href=""http://radcoffeecompany.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Rad Roasting Company</a>. The truck will be parked at Keep It Simple Farm in Redmond, Washington, so patrons will be able to sip a delicious latte while they walk the nature trail, and visit the farm animals. From start to finish, this project is all about community!</div>
<div>All the big pieces are already in place! All she needs is startup capital for:</div>

</div></div>","Tiffanie's Community Coffee Corner
It's time to help local legend Tiffanie Boldizsar spread her wings, and start her own business!
Years ago, Tiffanie moved here from the East Coast. Since then she has established herself as a cornerstone of the local community. She is a published chef, and a whiz in the kitchen, with years of management experience in food service. Recently, her back has become a serious health concern for her, and she needs a way to provide for her family that doesn't hurt her.  


The Plan
Transform an old truck into a community focused organic coffee truck, and help a single mother start her own business.

She has given us so much love, companionship, and delicious food over the years, please help us give some back to Tiffanie!   



What We Need
Tiffanie has already acquired the management experience, the culinary virtuosity, a van, and a couple of second hand espresso machines. She has also paired with local roasters: Rad Roasting Company. The truck will be parked at Keep It Simple Farm in Redmond, Washington, so patrons will be able to sip a delicious latte while they walk the nature trail, and visit the farm animals. From start to finish, this project is all about community!
All the big pieces are already in place! All she needs is startup capital for:


Paint


Furnishings


Payroll


Basic retail equipment set up

Other Espresso Equipment

Cups, utensils, etc.

Cleaning Supplies

Coffee


Food

 task is very difficult to achieve, especially if you are more than 50

culture, flair, art, pleasure, love and history. It is a big and an 
important treasure that people are loosing and that we want to save. 
Maybe we can do this bringing and introducing our “eat and drink”

would like to let our clients testing the flavour of good food, offering
 them music, art and literature, all related to the rites of good food. <br/><br/>“Cappuccio”
 is also a life plan, cause we believe that our clients are special and

desserts coming from the Italian tradition. We won’t offer full meals, 
but moments of meditation in order to achieve a good start of the day. <br/>Breakfast
 time, but also eating snacks before dinner, together with a quiet and 
relaxing atmosphere will be the main subjects of the day, even because 
they represent the most important moments to nourish the soul. <br/>Most of the ingredients are organic and purchased in the fair-trade. <br/></span></span></p><p><br/><span><span></span></span></p><p><span><span><b>Why do we need your help?</b></span></span></p><p><span><span></span></span>We are dealing with the most difficult challenge of achieving our life project, with our own strength, resources and with the people that want to believe in us.</p><p>As the soul of this idea is to create tastes, feelings and experiences for our guests, so we would like to build this idea with them and catch their thoughts and meld them with ours.</p><p>We need your help to realise our project in the best way we can, using the best products from Italy and Denmark and furnishing Cafè Cappuccio so that everyone that will step inside, will feel at home..

In three rooms and in one section of the corridor, there are still old pieces of jewelery under a drapery - namely the old wooden floorboards that we would like to sand down.6. Our heating! We heat with oil, which means we have two huge oil tanks in the garage, which every year need to be filled up for a decent amount of money. We would also like to change from heating with oil to woodchips, also for ecological reasons.7. At the moment, we are sleeping in our camping car next to the house during a full occupancy of the house, which in the long run is no real solution. Directly adjacent to the house is currently a 70sqm large, still fallow barn, which we would like to rebuild as an additional apartment.8. We want to fundamentally and newly isolate our roof.In addition, of course, there are redecorations, swipes, swapping things that break and this and that. And most importantly: we have to survive! :-).",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>MAXALIZER, a one-of-a-kind all natural fertilizer that can revolutionize the cannabis industry, not to mention gardening and farming by replacing poisons and toxic chemicals used as fertilizers now, with a series of products that are Earth Friendly and made by recycling plant nutrients using a process we invented.  </p>
<p><strong>But we know, in the fertilizer business, it's nice to be organic, Earth Friendly, and synthetic chemical free, but the most important detail is results and MAXALIZER is proven to beat synthetic chemicals in every test! </strong> </p>

<p>My name is Chad Currin and I have been a worm farmer for over a decade.  I started BioSoil Farm as a worm farm using custom bred night crawlers with diverse microbes in their gut to eat a special vegan diet in a specially created batch system to produce the best worm castings available on the market.</p>
<p>Many people know that worm castings by themselves make an amazing fertilizer, but they actually contain virtually no plant nutrients.  What worm castings do is breakdown the nutrients in the soil and ""fix"" them or make them available to the plants.  While many of my clients LOVED worm castings, I saw a need for a fertilizer that would work harmoniously with worm castings to provide the ULTIMATE PLANT DIET!  And the idea of MAXALIZER was born.</p>

<p>NUTRACYCLING is the process of recycling organic plant material and extracting the plant nutrients and ""using them again"" to feed a new generation of plants.  So we went about inventing a process to extract plant nutrients from things like banana peels, coffee grounds, egg shells, cauliflower and lettuces.  </p>

<p>Once we mastered the process of extracting the plant nutrients and suspending them in water, we set about testing over 100 different kinds of plants and foods to see what we could extract.  </p>
<p>Once we found what we could extract we made over 20 different formulas and tested them.  We measured their relative N-P-K and pH. </p>
<p>Then we tested our formulas to see which ones worked best.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p><strong>Now we are manufacturing MAXALIZER in small batches and producing about 1 TON of Worm Castings every week.</strong></p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Synthetic Fertilizers destroy our soil and our water.  Synthetic Fertilizers destroy the ecosystem of the soil creating a need for pesticides, fungicides and herbicides that are only needed because the synthetic fertilizers have destroyed the balance of microbes and life in the soil.  Synthetic Fertilizer is not ""plant ready"" and most of it runs off into streams, ponds and lakes where it causes massive algae blooms, depleting all the oxygen in the water and killing fish and the animals that depend on them.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489263535/qdzoczqfxmk1ltbohiqu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Because the plant nutrients Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous(P), and Potassium (K) and micronutrients in MAXALIZER are derived from plants it does not cause the same side effects.</p>
<p>Phosphorous and Potassium in most synthetic fertilizers are mined ripping open giant holes in the Earth to extract tons and tons of material that then needs to be heavily refined.</p>

<p>Synthetic Fertilizer is bad.  It had it's place but now we realize how dangerous it is and how bad it is for the planet and the time has come to rethink fertilizer.  MAXALIZER is the solution.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>1. Farmers, commercial greenhouses and others are used to synthetic fertilizers and while they know they are dangerous and toxic the results are proven and they don't want to lose their livelihood.  It may take some time for them to see there is a new way of doing things that provides better results without the dangerous side effects.</p>
<p>2. MAXALIZER is two products used together.  Worm Castings provide the essential microbes to break down the nutrients in MAXALIZER and make them available to the plants.  MAXALIZER is a liquid fertilizer that get's mixed 1/2 cup-1 cup per gallon of water.  People like ""easy"".  It may be a challenge to get people to use a two step program.  </p>
<p>3. MAXALIZER contains very low nutrient levels of NPK.  Some people are used to the propaganda that they need 20-20-20 formula or a 7-7-7 all purpose fertilizer.  Those numbers -the N-P-K nutrient percentages - are really only used for synthetics.  It's like thinking that if one multivitamin is good for people then a whole bottle would be better.  We all know what happens when we take tons of vitamins.  The body can't absorb them and they end up wasted.  Most synthetic nutrients end up wasted.  MAXALIZER's nutrients are time-released, don't ""run off into the water table"" and work with the Earth not against it, but it may be our biggest challenge to get people to use a better product but one that doesn't have the giant NPK numbers some are used to or think are important.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We need to raise $150,000 to finish the build out of our facility, the production line for MAXALIZER and the automated system for harvesting 10x the worm castings we currently harvest.  But we know not everyone can make a donation or people wonder what they can do besides making a cash donation.  LOTS ACTUALLY!!!</p>

<h3>Help and Hope-Be An Everyday Hero</h3>
<p>The Jersey Shore was devastated by Superstorm Sandy. We, along with so many others, had to begin again from the ground up. We had to heal and rebuild. We chose to rebuild our lives and our business right here at the Shore, and we could never have done it without the help of community.</p>
<p>After Sandy, wonderful people from all over came to our small beach town, everyday heroes who came offering help and hope. From the Red Cross to the military to just regular folks from neighboring cities and states who were there offering blankets, warm coats, hot meals, and unconditional friendship--they were people who wanted to make a difference. We will never forget these wonderful people who were there during our darkest hours, and the impact that these loving strangers made is far-reaching and unforgettable.</p>

<br/><p><b>And now it's our turn. We want to give back, to make a difference, to help rebuild and revitalize the Shore. It's about community and caring.</b></p>
<p>You can be a part of that. Believe us when we say--every dollar that goes to help small businesses flourish makes a huge difference. So many businesses were lost during Sandy, and some were unable to rebuild. Every business rebuilt means hope, revitalization, a strengthened economy, and a stronger community. By helping us rebuild, you will be making an indelible impact on the individuals and communities along the Shore. Your help and support will insure a long lasting impact on both individual lives and larger communities. Your support will not just be helping a small business grow. Your support will be making a real and lasting difference. </p>

<p>My grandparents
emigrated from Italy in 1925 seeking the American dream and wanting to bring
their food business to America. Back in Naples, my grandfather Joseph  grew olives and
pressed his own olive oil, grew grapes and made his own wine, and was an
artisanal cheese maker. He ran a small <i>grosseria </i>in Naples, and when he
came to America, his dream was to recreate that business. I can still remember
as a small child struggling to push a huge wheel of cheese up a wooden plank
into my grandfather's store.</p>
<p>I took those memories
and skills that I learned while working at my Grandpa Joe's side and eventually
went on to open my own gourmet food store. I tried to recapture that nostalgia
and feeling of family and old Italy, and it gave me a great amout of joy to be
able to follow in my grandfather's footsteps. Years later I met my business
partner, Elana, and together we created The Belvidere Baking Company.</p>
<p><b>Elana</b></p>
<p>After my grandparents
arrived from Europe in the early 1920's, they opened a successful garment
business in Chicago. They literally came with the shirts on their backs, and it
was through hard work and perseverence that they grew a business from the
ground up. Their success inspired me to dream about opening my own business one
day.</p>
<p>Kathryn and I love
what we do. We love people and we love good food, and our business allows us to
enjoy both. Sharing good food with good friends--there is just nothing better
than that!</p>

<br/><h3><b>Our Company

</b></h3>
<b><br/></b><p>We are the Belvidere Baking Company, and we make soft sweet artisan
Belvidere Biscuits. Our special 130-year-old family recipe--passed down to us
by our Grandmother Nicolina-is the best sweet you will ever eat. This is a family-owned business. It is much like the business that our grandfather brought from Italy to America in 1925.</p>
<p>We grew up in the food business, and so we know that great food is so much
more than just great food--it's a lifestyle. We took our grandmother's recipe
and tinkered with it, modified it, expanded it, and perfected it for years. As
it turns out, our blood, sweat and tears really paid off. The moment we took

With 22 flavors and counting, there is something for everyone. Double Cherry

<h3><b>A Unique Product is Hard to Come By</b></h3>
<p>Nothing like our product has ever been seen or tasted before, so we can
honestly and very excitedly say that our product is totally new to market. Not
too many products can say this. Our family recipe is an exciting new product
out there, and people love it. It's not yet another cookie, biscotti,

<p>We need to build on the growing trend of the return of small businesses...
those Mom and Pop stores where customers were treated like royalty, where
quality and customer service was never sacrificed for anything, when time and
attention and love were the cornerstones of business. We are ready to be  part of that. It's about putting out the best
quality products. It's about personalized customer service, it's about caring

surge in sales and increased demand, our momentum and traction, and critical
acclaim from the food industry tell us that we are ready. And we need your help
to make it happen.<br/><br/></p>
<h3><b>What We Need</b></h3>
<p>Our sweet artisan Belvidere Biscuits have caused a culinary sensation here
at the Shore and beyond, and as demand continues to build fast and furious, we
know that we are ready to take the next step. We have been asked by thousands
of people the million dollar question: <i><b>When are you opening a store?</b></i></p>
<p> Right now we are renting space in a
small commercial kitchen. It's tough working around the schedule of others, to
not have the counter or oven space needed to create and bake our product in
larger quantities, or the space to store ingredient inventory or the ability to retail our products. </p>
<p><b>With funds raised we will:</b></p>
<p>1. Rent a small retail space that will serve as both a baking facility and
a storefront. We will need to purchase equipment, such as ovens, stainless
steel work surfaces, and other necessary equipment. We will need to purchase bakery cases and retail fixtures for the storefront. We are looking for a former bakery space to minimize startup costs.</p>
<p>2. Expand our product line, such as savory biscuits, our gluten-free line, breads and stuffed breads, and
other artisan baked goods.</p>
<p>3. Purchase inventory- ingredients, packaging supplies, labeling, etc.</p>
<p>4. Licensing and permits.<br/><br/></p>
<h3><b>Why We Need It</b></h3>

Because we don't have our own facility, we are unable
to grow our product line, to expand, to fulfill larger orders, and to meet
customer demand. We cannot be available all the time, anytime--and we want to
be! Customers call us all the time--<b>""Where is your store located? I need
to get some biscuits!"" or ""Are you still open? I'm throwing a party
and need a tray of biscuits!""</b> It happens all the time. We don't ever want
to be forced to turn down any orders. <br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3><b>What We're Up To Right Now</b></h3>
<p>We currently sell online from our website, in New Jersey retailers like
America's Cup Coffee Company in Asbury Park, Just Jersey in Morristown, and
others, and at vendor events such as spring and fall festivals, farm markets,
arts, music, and food festivals, among others. <br/><br/><b>Please visit our website at: </b><a href=""http://www.thebelviderebakingco.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.thebelviderebakingco.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.thebelviderebakingco.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Belvidere Baking Company Online </a></p>

<h3><b>Our Customers</b></h3>
<p>We totally love the festivals and farm markets we attend because we get to meet our customers, to
interact with them, to get to know them. Our customers are a diverse crowd from
all walks of life, but they all have one thing in common--they are addicted to
our biscuits! We can honestly say that we have forged lasting friendships with
many of our wonderful customers that we have met at these events. There's no
feeling in the world as wonderful as being able to share something special that
you have created with others, to see the smile on their faces as they bite into
something you've made for them to enjoy. We put so much time, attention, and
commitment into every single one of our artisan biscuits, and it is so
rewarding to see those customer reactions. Good food made with love and care
often leads to good friends, and that is exactly what happens everytime someone
bites into one of our biscuits. </p>

<p>Our booth--which is our current ""storefront""- always seems to be
the ""happening place"" at every event we attend. Maybe it's because we
stand out there, greeting customers, offering them generous samples and great
conversation. We schmooze, they eat, they buy, they come back with family and
friends...and it's loads of fun. We love the camaraderie, the laughter, the
love as our customers eat and enjoy and obsess over our biscuits. Yes, we sell
out at every event--every single one. It happens every time without exception.
Our biscuits have caused a culinary craze--and we are loving it! </p>

larger quantities, or the space to store ingredient inventory or the ability to retail our products. 
With funds raised we will:
1. Rent a small retail space that will serve as both a baking facility and
a storefront. We will need to purchase equipment, such as ovens, stainless
steel work surfaces, and other necessary equipment. We will need to purchase bakery cases and retail fixtures for the storefront. We are looking for a former bakery space to minimize startup costs.
2. Expand our product line, such as savory biscuits, our gluten-free line, breads and stuffed breads, and
other artisan baked goods.
3. Purchase inventory- ingredients, packaging supplies, labeling, etc.
4. Licensing and permits.
Why We Need It

Because we don't have our own facility, we are unable
to grow our product line, to expand, to fulfill larger orders, and to meet
customer demand. We cannot be available all the time, anytime--and we want to
be! Customers call us all the time--""Where is your store located? I need
to get some biscuits!"" or ""Are you still open? I'm throwing a party
and need a tray of biscuits!"" It happens all the time. We don't ever want
to be forced to turn down any orders. 

What We're Up To Right Now
We currently sell online from our website, in New Jersey retailers like
America's Cup Coffee Company in Asbury Park, Just Jersey in Morristown, and
others, and at vendor events such as spring and fall festivals, farm markets,
arts, music, and food festivals, among others. Please visit our website at: The Belvidere Baking Company Online 



We are very active on social media. We love talking, tweeting and connecting with our customers, food industry specialists and foodies from around the world. Please join us on any of our social media channels.

Our Customers
We totally love the festivals and farm markets we attend because we get to meet our customers, to
interact with them, to get to know them. Our customers are a diverse crowd from
all walks of life, but they all have one thing in common--they are addicted to
our biscuits! We can honestly say that we have forged lasting friendships with
many of our wonderful customers that we have met at these events. There's no
feeling in the world as wonderful as being able to share something special that
you have created with others, to see the smile on their faces as they bite into
something you've made for them to enjoy. We put so much time, attention, and
commitment into every single one of our artisan biscuits, and it is so
rewarding to see those customer reactions. Good food made with love and care
often leads to good friends, and that is exactly what happens everytime someone
bites into one of our biscuits. 


Our booth--which is our current ""storefront""- always seems to be
the ""happening place"" at every event we attend. Maybe it's because we
stand out there, greeting customers, offering them generous samples and great
conversation. We schmooze, they eat, they buy, they come back with family and
friends...and it's loads of fun. We love the camaraderie, the laughter, the
love as our customers eat and enjoy and obsess over our biscuits. Yes, we sell
out at every event--every single one. It happens every time without exception.
Our biscuits have caused a culinary craze--and we are loving it!

Hello! 
As I suspected, the biscuits were a HUGE hit!  We ended up at my nephew's new houseSaturday evening and I brought them for dessert. Oh my goodness, everyone went crazy over them.  I can see why the Cherry Chocolate Walnut is your most popular flavor!! Wow!  My Mom said the lemon was her favorite.  Oh and the Blueberry!!! Coconut was my husband's favorite. Glad you were able to give me an assortment.

business, there are some really good indicators that can often guarantee a
successful business venture. It takes a strong and solid business plan, proper

Presque Isle Farm is a small family farm owned and operated by Molly and Dion Stepanski in northern Michigan. Deemed a Centennial Farm by the Michigan Historical Society, this homestead has been with the same family for over 100 years. In 2014, we began working to transform the land into a thriving market vegetable farm. Our mission is to grow nourishing food, a healthy community, a vibrant local economy, and a restorative environmental system.         What We Need and Why We Need It
We recently received a $10,000 grant from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and a $15,000 zero interest loan from Hoophouses for Health and the Michigan Farmers Market Association.  Hoophouses for Health ""increases access to Good Food for vulnerable families while at the same time expanding the Good Food infrastructure and season extension capacity of Michigan farmers."" Through this program we will establish relationships with local schools to develop farm to school programs and work with community social networks to increase farm to table access. 
We are more than halfway to our goal, but need another $20,000 to implement our ambitious $45,000 healthy food access and conservation plan. The plan includes building greenhouses, establishing an apiary and permanent bee habitat, and developing an environmental restoration soil fertility plan.

The high tunnel greenhouses will  increase healthy food access and allow for a year-round growing season to produce more food for local schools and families while utilizing fewer resources . 
The establishment of permanent bee habitat and an apiary will encourage healthy pollination, essential to the entire planet’s food production system and ecosystem.
The development of an environmental restoration cover crop and soil fertility plan will increase the nutritional value we can provide to the community, solidify the farm’s future in the local economy, and balance the local ecology.

The cost of implementing our complete healthy food and conservation plan is approximately $45,000. With $10,000 covered by the NRCS, and $15,000 covered by the Hoophouses for Health loan, we are asking for support towards the remaining $20,000.

Our stretch goals include:

Your Generosity's Impact
Supporting us necessarily means supporting a local business, bringing true wealth to our regional economy, and helping our communities grow happier and healthier. Local and sustainable food helps combat a food system that floods our grocery stores and schools with nutrient-deficient food. Our agricultural practices act as a regenerative force against climate change and the extinction of bees and other invertebrate pollinators.

 Background

My name is Joe Ryden. I developed the Finfit method of investing by  adapting several techniques that I had used when I worked for a large manufacturing company in product quality control. The basic premise used  is to operate in the present. No attempt is made to predict future events like most  current investing methods, such as the faulty buy and hold. 
During my working career I was awarded 5 patents.How Does It Work?

We invest only in Fidelity Select sector funds of which there are generally 40. Each fund represents a sector of the overall market, such as energy, computers and transportation.

Each fund consists of a number of individual stocks that are engaged in that particular sector. This feature offers lower risk over investing in an individual stock. 
We only invest in 5 funds at a time These are chosen using by our proprietary selection method.
There are times when we will hold fewer than 5 funds. On rare occasions, we park all our money in a market fund.  
Our turn-over rate is small. Approximately 50% of our funds are held more than one year.
To get started, you first have to have a brokerage account. Since the funds that we purchase are Fidelity funds, it may be easier to open an account with Fidelity Investments. This requires a $ 10,000 minimum for the Fidelity Select funds account. 
When you receive our newsletter, either purchase or sell the Select funds indicated. Instructions will be provided as to  where to put the proceeds from a fund sale.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><br/></p><p>Every day, homebrewers around the world create delicious brews, but they can only share them with their closest friends. Today, in order to reach a greater audience, brewers have to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars in expensive equipment, locations, licenses, marketing, and distribution. It’s simply something most craft brewers can not do, and the world suffers for the lack of their beer.</p>
<h3><br/></h3><h3>We plan to change all that.</h3>
<p><br/></p><p>International Brewers is the world’s first open-source brewery. We are making the investment so homebrewers don’t have to. Craft beer artisans will send us their recipes. We will taste them, and if they’re great, we’ll brew them, cask and bottle them, label them, and distribute them to bars and restaurants in Panama and eventually to the rest of the world.</p>
<h3><br/></h3><h3>How will it work?</h3>
<p><br/></p><p>In the music industry, artists create demo tracks and submit them to record labels. The labels listen to each demo and decide whether or not to produce it. Once they do, they work with the artist to create a high quality recording and cover art, then distribute that final product around the world, sharing the profits with the artist.</p>
<p>We plan to model International Brewers after this system. We will accept brews submitted by craft beer makers and taste them. If we like them, we’ll move forward by producing a test batch and giving it a trial in our taproom. If it proves popular, we’ll work with our marketers to create a label design with the artist’s signature, then bottle and distribute the beer around Panama. Profits from beer sales will be shared with the brew’s original creator.</p>
<h3><br/></h3><h3>The Brewery</h3>
<p><br/></p><p>The brewery will contain:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>One 2000 liter brewing system (MLT+KWT+HLT), </p></li>

Every day, homebrewers around the world create delicious brews, but they can only share them with their closest friends. Today, in order to reach a greater audience, brewers have to invest hundreds of thousands of dollars in expensive equipment, locations, licenses, marketing, and distribution. It’s simply something most craft brewers can not do, and the world suffers for the lack of their beer.
We plan to change all that.
International Brewers is the world’s first open-source brewery. We are making the investment so homebrewers don’t have to. Craft beer artisans will send us their recipes. We will taste them, and if they’re great, we’ll brew them, cask and bottle them, label them, and distribute them to bars and restaurants in Panama and eventually to the rest of the world.
How will it work?
In the music industry, artists create demo tracks and submit them to record labels. The labels listen to each demo and decide whether or not to produce it. Once they do, they work with the artist to create a high quality recording and cover art, then distribute that final product around the world, sharing the profits with the artist.
We plan to model International Brewers after this system. We will accept brews submitted by craft beer makers and taste them. If we like them, we’ll move forward by producing a test batch and giving it a trial in our taproom. If it proves popular, we’ll work with our marketers to create a label design with the artist’s signature, then bottle and distribute the beer around Panama. Profits from beer sales will be shared with the brew’s original creator.
The Brewery
The brewery will contain:

One 2000 liter brewing system (MLT+KWT+HLT), 
Four 2000 liter unitank fermenters, 
a semi-automatic bottling line, and
a double-station keg filler

All this adds up to a peak production capacity of 2,000 barrels of beer each year, with the ability to grow organically.
The Restaurant
In front of the brewery, we are building a taproom. Along with delicious beers, we’ll offer an impressive fusion of local and international flavors, with beer-friendly delicacies such as shepherd’s pie and moroccan fish tacos.
The restaurant will be built using a converted shipping container, in the style of the almost extinct, locally iconic “Diablo Rojo” buses. Food will be pre-made and served hot. The restaurant and upstairs terrace will have a 50 person seating capacity.
The Distribution System
We have already established relationships with local distributors to ensure that beers are carried at restaurants and bars throughout Panama. We’ll also be running our own distribution system reaching even the smallest businesses, such as food trucks and kiosks. We eventually plan to branch out and establish international distribution channels. This is made possible by Panama’s unique status as a global distribution hub and financial center.
What do we have?
We have already started the process of building the brewery. We have formed the company. We have raised capital for the equipment. We have sourced the ingredients. We’ve even created the first three beers to be bottled and distributed. We’re well on our way to becoming fully operational in six months time.
What do we still need?
We’ve already raised 70% of the capital required. We’re lacking $80,000 which will be spent on operational costs for the first year, including:

Rent,
Salaries,
Utilities,
Maintenance, 
Ingredients,
Insurance, and
Marketing

Last year we raised 400-500 broilers. This year we would like to increase that to 800-1,000. With the market Matthew has opened up and the adequate processing capability created by this project, we would increase production in 2017 and 2018 up to 4,000 birds per year and commit to bringing them to the new facility. We hope to see this project funded as it will help us and other small producers in Alabama expand our operations.""</p><p>------</p><p>""When we found your farm and processing facility online back in April, we could not have been more thrilled. We have struggled to produce enough pasture raised poultry in our State of Mississippi due to limited to no access for small scale poultry producers to process their birds. We were only allowed to process 1,000 birds ourselves, and this limited our growth drastically over the last six years.</p><p>Since we have partnered with you to not only process our own pasture raised poultry, but also to purchase your pasture raised poultry it has helped our business grow immensely. We are now able to sell pastured poultry at farmers markets, grocery stores, restaurants, and our own buying clubs. Without your hard work and dedication to growing and processing poultry, we would continue to struggle to have the birds needed for our markets.""</p><p>------</p><p>""If they [Marble Creek] are able to create a market for poultry then we will be interested in growing for it. We currently raise 50 to 100 broilers annually for our retail channels. If a market existed that was profitable for us we could grow 2,400 (200 a month) annually in addition. We hope to see this project funded as it can really make a difference to the financial sustainability of our operation."" </p><h2>Credits </h2><p>Thank you so much to our great friends at the <a href=""http://asanonline.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Alabama Sustainable Agriculture Network (ASAN)</a> for their support of this campaign.  Thank you so much to <a href=""http://www.andreamabry.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Andrea Mabry</a> for shooting the video.  Thank you very much to <a href=""http://joshuajhamilton.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Joshua Hamilton</a> for editing the video.  Thank you especially to all our consumer and farmer customers who support both our businesses!  </p></div>","Do you think that it is important to have access to food produced locally in way that is respectful of the land, people working to grow it, and the animals?Do you want to be able to buy meat that was raised outside of confinement systems, not subjected to daily doses of antibiotics, and fed pasture and high quality feed that isn’t made with genetically modified organisms?Do you want to see the rural communities around Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi have their economies revitalized?If so, we are asking for your support.We are Pell City Processing and Marble Creek Farmstead. Our farm raises pigs, cows, chickens, goats, sheep, ducks, geese, guineas, and rabbit for our local community. The demand for our meats has been high, particularly for chicken. We raise them with a non-GMO feed on fresh pasture. The nutrient density, flavor, and quality of these birds cannot be beat. As a result, we have had interest from restaurants and grocery stores to provide them with chicken.But there was a problem…The closest USDA-inspected facility for us to get them processed was in Kentucky. That is too far for the birds and the people. It just wouldn’t work.We worked with the state and found a recently shuttered facility. We agreed to take it over if we could get approval to process chickens there. Well, they did, and we have been open for business for 3.5 months now. But is a hard and expensive road to be good at operating a processing facility.You have to balance labor costs, tons of government regulations, high equipment costs, and the need for low prices from the farmers you process for. Although it's a challenge, we can make it with your help.What do we need?Operating funds and funds to buy much-needed equipment.EquipmentIn an ideal world, we would raise enough funds to buy all this equipment.

<h3>More about Bewilder:</h3>
<p>Founded in 2016, our mission is to share our awe for the natural world with both clients and students. We believe there is so much more to floral design than what meets the eye--human connection with flowers is ancient and sacred. Flowers signify the passing of seasons, and in their brief and beautiful lives teach us about the ephemerality of our world. </p>
<p>As a part of this mission, Larisa leads a team of volunteers at the Zen Hospice Project to provide donated flowers to hospice patients each week. The Bewilder team also aims to provide a quarterly zine and regular online posts, featuring everything from how-tos to botanical musings, for anyone wanting to get in touch with their wilder side.</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Kyo Pang and I am the owner/ chef at Kopitiam.  Kopitiam was opened since September 2015 in Lower East Side. Thanks to all the loves and supports from our followers, Kopitiam has become one of the local scene in the neighborhood, and the interest in our food has grown to the point that we have many social media followers follow us around five boroughs.</p>
<p>Kopitiam means ""coffee shop"" in our language back home. Kopitiam serves as a specific spot for the locals just like their second home. Kopitiam not only serves as a coffee shop, but also offering local street foods that people will never get bored with, even for everyday. </p>
<p>When I opened up this place, I wanted to create a store for people who are just like me, who had left home for many years, and still missed the taste back home. I wanted to create a spot where people will feel like home, a warm and friendly spot that people started any conversations comfortably with anyone that are sitting right next to them everyday. I believe that this is something New York City has always been lacking of. </p>
<p>In Kopitiam, we specialized in traditional Baba Nyonya cuisine. Baba Nyonya cuisine is one of the oldest and fading tradition because the preparation process is so delicate and time consuming.  Our delicacies are very colorful, flavorful and visionally exciting. On top of that, we do not use any additive, just like in the old days, we use flowers and leaves to create the colors of the treats that we carefully handcrafted. </p>
<p>I'm the third generations from a Baba Nyonya family and my family were well known for a wide variety of traditional Baba Nyonya cuisine and Kuih or the past 50 years in Malaysia. I wasn't raised to be a chef nor I was once proud that I was raise as the eldest Nyonya in my family. With all the feedbacks we received from the customers, I finally understand and accept my duty as a Nyonya, a woman who is dedicate to cook for loves.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our current landlord has requested for another 25% increase after our 2 years rent ends. Therefore, we have decided to move to a bigger location and expand to a larger menu.  However, our abilities are limited and the expansion is expansive. So, please help us to keep this beautiful tradition alive by supporting Kopitiam.</p>
<p>Our final day will be until end of this coming December. We have found another location nearby and was hoping that we can lock down the location as soon as possible. With your help, the funds we received will be used for renovations and equipments purchases. We hope to be up and running by February/March 2018. We are not asking for just donation but for the amount you put in, will be used as gift credits and can be redeemed at our new store. </p>
<p>Your support will be extremely appreciated. Please follow our updates and hope to see you soon at our new Kopitiam!</p>

<h3>ABOUT US</h3>
<p>Lyddie's Goods LLC is a small food business that provides a wide range of meals including classic American comfort food, Thai cuisine and Thai fusion dishes. Lyddie's Goods started as a not so serious part time gig to provide eggrolls, crab rangoon and other snacks to friends and family about 2 summers ago.  As things started to pick up and orders started to roll in we found it difficult to balance both our full-time jobs and the orders from Lyddie's. One year later, Lydia decided to take a leap of faith to pursue her biggest goal.  She always had a love for cooking and dreamed of opening a small restaurant one day, so she left her full-time job in order to take the necessary steps to grow her food business. Lydia's partner Brad stood by and helped every way he could as she took every step possible in order to legitimize Lyddie's Goods. Over time, Lydia found a commercial kitchen to cook out of and was able to get her food license. Currently, the business runs weekly meal specials that are available for pick up/delivery and you can catch them at the Milford Farmers Market twice a month or grab a cup of hot soup at The Nashua Garden located in downtown Nashua, NH. Lydia does most of the cooking by herself but sometimes has assistance from her mother, Noy and of course her biggest supporter and partner, Brad. </p>
<p>As you can see, Lyddie's is a small operation but it is so dear to us. Most of our greatest memories revolve around our family, friends and great food. Those three things create this feeling that is almost indescribable and it's something that you feel in your heart. It truly is the best feeling being around the ones that you love - talking, laughing, sharing and bonding together over a great meal. It makes you feel happy and whole. We want to create that environment for you so if you choose to dine in, you not only enjoy our food but you can enjoy it in a space that was geared to make you feel comfortable and at ease.</p>
<h2>A Couple Of Our Goals </h2>
<ul>
<li>To provide you with a wide array  of food using fresh ingredients that will rock your taste buds. We love making things in small batches because it allows us to pay close attention during the process and we can assure you that everything was made with extra love and care. </li>
<li>Build and create long lasting relationships and connections with our customers. We want to make an impact by bringing people together and being interactive with our community.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Your contribution will help us on our journey to find our first home for Lyddie's Goods. Starting a business is never easy and we've laid the ground work to get our food business growing but now we are asking for support from our friends, colleagues and community to help us fund this massive undertaking. </p>

<h3>What Your Contribution Will Go Towards</h3>
<p>Opening your own restaurant is never easy or cheap, so with that being said....here is a brief breakdown of what your contributions will go towards. </p>
<ul>

<li>The first 6-9 months of operating costs.</li>

<p>As a former editor at <i>Vogue</i>, <i>Women's Wear Daily</i> and <i>W</i> magazine, I have a New York City, high fashion background. As a native of the Bay Area, I speak California.

<p>Hero Shop will focus on established designer brands and West Coast labels. This will give the store a distinctly California vibe and help promote local talent. A wide range of prices—from $20 to $5,000—means that everyone can participate, from the fashion conscious to the fashion curious. </p>
<p><span>An expert team of Hero Shop stylists will be available for wardrobe curation, personal shopping, and personal styling. Friendly staff will cater to customers' busy lives with flexible, personal service. </span></p>
<p><span>Hero Shop events will build community within and around the store. Designer dinners, book parties, speaker series, and movie nights are all in the works! Also, conversations with organizations like <a href=""http://www.raphaelhouse.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Raphael House</a> and <a href=""http://826valencia.org/our-new-tenderloin-center-needs-your-old-stuff/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">826 Valencia</a> have already begun to explore how Hero Shop can support the important work they do. </span></p>

Hero Shop will focus on established designer brands and West Coast labels. This will give the store a distinctly California vibe and help promote local talent. A wide range of prices—from $20 to $5,000—means that everyone can participate, from the fashion conscious to the fashion curious. 
An expert team of Hero Shop stylists will be available for wardrobe curation, personal shopping, and personal styling. Friendly staff will cater to customers' busy lives with flexible, personal service. 
Hero Shop events will build community within and around the store. Designer dinners, book parties, speaker series, and movie nights are all in the works! Also, conversations with organizations like Raphael House and 826 Valencia have already begun to explore how Hero Shop can support the important work they do. 
Indiegogo Campaign
 
I'm raising $100,000 to cover the build out of our location at 982 Post Street. Permits, contractors, inspectors, compliancy requirements, lighting, dressing rooms, display fixtures and cosmetic improvements are all costs we'll be incurring over the next 5-6 months. 
I know it's a busy time of year, and I'm grateful for all contributions. Even $5 helps! 
 
The Impact
Hero Shop is my vote of confidence in San Francisco style and the Tenderloin neighborhood. My hope is that the store’s success inspires more people to open diverse businesses that speak to artistic communities, bring distinct style to the city, and pay attention to San Francisco’s vibrant neighborhoods.

<h3>My Mission!</h3>
<p>My Name is Mel Birchett, I am a Licensed Cosmetologist in the State of Michigan. I have been a Stylist/Skin Care Specialist in the Metro Detroit area for over 10 years. My area of expertise is in healthy hair, skin and nails. For years I have taken a more holistic approach to my products and services, and it is my main goal to educate my clients and others with textbook knowledge and knowledge of my experiences.</p>
<p>This campaign was created with the customer in mind. Many women and men suffer from some sort of hair, skin, and nail conditions caused by either themselves or a careless professional. It is my goal to develop a Salon and Clinical Spa that will not only leave the client looking their best but feeling confident that they are on the road to being their best, inside as well. <b>Definitely NOT your ordinary salon!</b> </p>
<p>With your donations, Stylz Salon and Clinical Spa will be able to offer its customers services in ALL areas of Cosmetology. This salon will include; Hair Care, Skin Care, Nail care, Massage Therapy, and also treatment from a Board Certified Dermatologist/Trichologist as needed.  The Beauty Industry is FULL of horror stories and cases of disease transfer, hair loss, chemical burns, etc.! It is my goal to restore faith in the beauty industry, one stylist, one client, one salon at a time.</p>
<h3>This is a give and take campaign!</h3>
<p>To begin building this business, I am asking the public (or should I say consumer) for a total of $30,000. While I know this is a small amount for such a big project, I am confident that more investments will be made. These funds will go toward the purchase(or lease) and renovation of the salon as well as supplies.</p>
<p>As a thank you to you, <i><b>your donations will also go toward your first visit at the salon</b>!</i> That's right, you will be able to benefit from your investment into my dream!</p>
<p>           In the event that my goal is not reached in the time allowed, all donations will              go towards a smaller version of this business. Either way....THE VISION WILL             HAPPEN!</p>
<h3>The Impact on the Community!</h3>
<div>I am a giver, and my salon will give as well! <p>In my personal life, I donate to many medical awareness funds, the homeless, and many others who are in need. I've always said, ""If I have it, you have it. If I don't have it, I'll figure out how you can get it.""  With that said, It is my goal to help Detroit's homeless with free haircuts once a month, and also free meals once a month. Currently, under my business name, I collect boots for the homeless and pass them out to homeless men and women in downtown Detroit. This is my second year collecting and it is rewarding to be able to help in some small way. I am excited to see the growth of this Boot Drive in the years to come!</p>
<p>We will also have discounts for college students in the area and business professionals in the area as well!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Bumps in the road....</h3>
<p>I am pretty sure there will be bumps in the road along the way. I count them as learning moments and growth for my business. Many people don't know the technicalities of opening a business, that's why many startups fail.</p>
<ul>
<li>Because I have made a plan for action, I believe I can overcome hurdles.</li>
<li>I have, and will continue to, connect with my salon owner friends. Asking questions and listening to sound advice! I will also work closely with my management team to make this business very successful. Not just for myself, but for my community! </li>

We can't thank you enough for this
experience. 


Imagine 60 new high output water wells throughout Africa, thousands of new African farm acres managed by the villagers
themselves, five schools that include computers, buses, and solar/wind energy.  25 full time employees (farming professionals and
teachers) and hundreds of volunteers.  The project as a whole is doing amazing things! FTDR is currently leasing a water rig in Zimbabwe, our own is currently being shipped to Zimbabwe.  These Indiegogo funds will be used to purchase a second Water drilling rig, doubling our humanitarian efforts.  Any extra funds will be used for the school's needs or water storage tanks.  
The Need:
Many of our projects are already underway. We have discovered that when a village has food, water, farms, school access, and medical the news spreads quickly and families are drawn in from surrounding areas magnifying the needs to a much greater level.  This is great because it is what we are there to assist with.  These additional people are always willing to help work to make the project  successful. We share in the hope of so many as they assist in helping their villages to become self sustaining.
Feed, Teach, Develop, & Repeat

30 new high output water wells and storage units
5 new schools with buses and computers
5 new medical facilities staffed by other organizations

Farmland developed by professionals, managed by villages


Wind and Solar energy supporting schools, medical facilities, water pumps to fill the storage tanks.

25 full time employees (farming professionals, teachers, bus drivers, drilling rig foremen, equipment manager)

Reality
TV. Documenting the joys, challenges, and experiences of these amazing people! There are two television networks currently creating bids for rights for this opportunity. (This will start after Zimbabwe, since video recordings or news agencies are currently not allowed.)

To show our debt of gratitude:
Feed, Teach, Develop, & Repeat


We will duplicate our success
world wide to under-privileged
third world villages. 


We have many partnerships in food development focusing on the nutritional needs of these African villages. These are being freely donated. Anything we develop will be made available at wholesale to all donors. Long term high nutrition food storage.  True wholesale.


Excitement

These people are amazing! Their joy in the face of incredible challenges is absolutely inspiring!  Thank you for sharing the adventure.
