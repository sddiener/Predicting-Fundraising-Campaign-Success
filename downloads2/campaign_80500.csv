<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>My new album, <i>Heartrender</i>, is an intense, emotional, and exciting work, and to be quite honest, I think it's the best thing I've ever made.</p>
<p>In order to give the album a chance to find a bigger audience, I'm excited to be working with Noisy Ghost PR (out of Austin, TX). They're a well-established, excellent PR firm that I'm certain will do a great job helping me get interviews, album reviews, and track premieres.</p>
<p>I need your help to get CDs sent to the influencers who can really make a difference in getting this album heard. This page is the place to support me by buying a CD or digital download in advance.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's the breakdown of my costs:<br/><strong>CD Manufacturing</strong> (Duplication, Shipping, and Tax for 150 CDs): $450<br/><strong>Mailing </strong>(100 promo copies sent to journalists/blogs): $350<br/><strong>Taxes and Processing Fees</strong> (approx. 16% of total): $75</p>
<p>Total: $875</p>
<p>Please check out my perks - I've got several levels of donation, from digital downloads to signed CDs and exclusively designed copies of the lyrics.</p>
<p>I'll be releasing the album whether or not I reach the funding goal. With your help, this album will have a better chance of making the impact I feel it deserves.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I've finished the album's final masters and am distributing them digitally worldwide via The Orchard. Your support will make a huge difference in allowing me to order physical CDs - my first physical pressing ever!</p>
<p>It's an exciting next step in my musical career. Things are starting to get serious, and I want you to be a part of it.</p>
<div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I've been saving up for months to pay for the initial PR cost. The digital campaign is 100% ready to go, so I'm asking for your help on the physical portion.</p>
<p>Without this physical component, fewer bloggers and journalists may be willing to listen to my music and give me editorial coverage. The 100 journalists I'm sending CDs to have specifically indicated that they require or prefer CDs to review material.</p>
<p>I've already designed the CDs and have the order ready to go - I just need a little push to get over the finish line.</p>

<h3><strong>Official Bio</strong></h3>
<p>Eric Benoit isn’t fucking around. Literally or metaphorically.</p>
<p>With the January 26th release of his sophomore album, <i>Heartrender</i>, he tears into sex, love, and the body, laughing at the absurdity of it all just to keep from breaking apart. Telling the story of a ruinous, short-lived relationship, the album documents his attempt to come to terms with sexual trauma.</p>
<p>Benoit’s musical project began in the summer of 2014 with his live debut as Artist of the Month at The Bitter End Singer-Songwriter Series (NYC). Two years later, he released his debut album, <i>College</i>. Never shy about approaching difficult topics, he told a story of self-harm, a peer’s suicide, and the mental toll of dealing with the unique stresses of the American college campus.</p>
<p>Across <i>Heartrender’s </i>seven slow-burning tracks, Benoit takes a leap forward with a newly energized sound. While maintaining the immersive cinematic style of his debut LP, he draws new inspiration from a wide range of styles, including experimental dance music, indie folk-rock, and alternative singer-songwriter.</p>
<p>“Fucking is a disease / Procreation is incest,” goes the chorus of lead single “Dragonflies”. The album may not be for the faint-hearted, but the pain of a relationship gone wrong swings universal. There is a Heartrender in all of us.</p>
<p><i>Quotes from the Press on His Last Single, “Symptom / Doubt”:</i></p>
<p><i>“The track builds slowly into a track that journeys through the darkest sounds Daft Punk would wish they had made. There’s a lot of beauty in darkness and Benoit does a great job in uncovering it.” - Electronic North</i></p>
<p><i>“It takes more than 2 minutes for any kind of percussion or beat to kick in, and when it does, you’re well aboard a fast moving train in a tunnel with no lights. Musically speaking, of course…” - Too Much Love Magazine</i></p>

Official Bio
Eric Benoit isn’t fucking around. Literally or metaphorically.
With the January 26th release of his sophomore album, Heartrender, he tears into sex, love, and the body, laughing at the absurdity of it all just to keep from breaking apart. Telling the story of a ruinous, short-lived relationship, the album documents his attempt to come to terms with sexual trauma.
Benoit’s musical project began in the summer of 2014 with his live debut as Artist of the Month at The Bitter End Singer-Songwriter Series (NYC). Two years later, he released his debut album, College. Never shy about approaching difficult topics, he told a story of self-harm, a peer’s suicide, and the mental toll of dealing with the unique stresses of the American college campus.
Across Heartrender’s seven slow-burning tracks, Benoit takes a leap forward with a newly energized sound. While maintaining the immersive cinematic style of his debut LP, he draws new inspiration from a wide range of styles, including experimental dance music, indie folk-rock, and alternative singer-songwriter.
“Fucking is a disease / Procreation is incest,” goes the chorus of lead single “Dragonflies”. The album may not be for the faint-hearted, but the pain of a relationship gone wrong swings universal. There is a Heartrender in all of us.

<h3>Schizo-Effective Singer/Songwriter</h3>
<p>I grew up on a hillside in Caroline Center, NY and began my music career in the second grade playing the fiddle. After a hiatus, I took up the banjo in my late teens after graduating from an alternative school in nearby Ithaca, and being being diagnosed with a mental illness. While I will always play banjo for friends and family, I've switched to electric guitar. Making music is what I love to do.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">As someone diagnosed with a serious mental illness, I've been told a lot about what to expect out of life.  People I don't even know judge me as 'crazy'; and say nothing I do will ever work out.</span></p>

<p>But now I want to make these tracks sound better, in a professional recording studio.</p>
<p>I made some GREAT connections while spending time in Memphis, TN last fall, working with people like Harry Koniditsiotis at Five and Dime recording studios to record this track:</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>First of all we absolutely <u>love</u> our NW fans! This time we are going BIG and shooting for the stars in original fashion. It has been 8 years since we have produced an original album &amp; we are so excited to deliver a ""next level"" quality album to the world with your help. </p>
<p>For those that may <u>not</u> know us, here is some background info about us. As married musicians of 12 years, we (Ben &amp; Suzie Bradford) have been recording and performing for over 15 years.  Originally from Spokane, we moved to Seattle in 2004 and have performed thousands of shows throughout the PNW. January 2017, we embarked on a dream on top of a dream by buying our house on wheels, allowing us to be mobile and go where the music takes us. After going by the name, ""The Side Project,"" since 2003, we have decided to make our name more recognizable to the online music fans and will be releasing the new original album under the name, ""Good Night Suzie."" ""The Side Project"" will continue as mainly a cover band and ""Good Night Suzie"" will be the entity for all future original works. We believe that the vocals are the heart of what we have always done and the title our band needs to represent that.  Please visit our current website for The Side Project Band @ <a href=""http://www.tspband.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.tspband.com</a> for more information on our musical evolution. </p>

released!Although the demo recordings have been licensed for use 
in film and television quite a few times, I have yet to release a proper
 full length album. This is where you come in! By pre-ordering the album
 you will help raise the money needed to pay for its final stage before release: the mixing and 
mastering process. For those of you who want to donate a higher amount, there
 are some cool bonus rewards to make it worth your while.IMPORTANT: MAKE SURE TO CLICK ON THE PERK YOU WANT! IF YOU JUST ENTER AN AMOUNT IN THE DONATION BOX IT WON'T REGISTER THAT YOU WANT ONE.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p></p>
<p><b>Devin Hendrick</b> is a lifestyle and creative portrait photographer. <b>Katie Minnema</b> is a bilingual environmentalist. They're celebrating their 10-year friendiversary with an enormously ambitious project. It's called <b>Full Circle</b>.</p>
<p>Setting sail from their home base in Michigan, the two women will start a two-month road-trip around the United States. Along the way, they will wander themselves to artistic encounters. It all starts with meeting people. Making connections with a drag queen, a fourth-generation farmer, or a glass-blower, the travelers will tell their stories. The subjects of the art are more than passive posers. To capture the true essence of a moment, a lifestyle photographer integrates herself in the communities she photographs so that they are no longer aware of the camera. She does not impose on their uniqueness. The two travelers will harness their encounters to stoke the creative fire; the goal is unrestricted creation. They’ll share their projects and happenings through their <a href=""https://goexplorefullcircle.squarespace.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">blog</a>,<a href=""https://instagram.com/devinhendrickphoto/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> instagram</a> and <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/goexplorefullcircle"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">facebook</a>. They’ve made a promise: no hotels, no judgments, no regrets. They’re bunking up with family and friends, camping in the great outdoors, and occasionally couchsurfing. When they’ve finished the trip and kicked off their shoes (if those hippies are wearing any), they will create a book that features portraits and stories of the characters and landscapes they encounter. Your funding makes this creative journey possible.</p>
<p>From its inception to its completion, Full Circle is collaborative. Crowdfunding is a way of democratizing the artistic process. When a dialogue opens between an artist and her audience, there is a unique intimacy behind each image. It's different than purchasing a piece of artwork at a gallery. Funders invest their money and their faith, and in return, the artist shares not only tangible art but an intangible connection to something beyond the photograph. The explorers appreciate contributions from people like you who care about creativity, connections, and culture. Full Circle is about connecting with like-minded people and coming together to create something bigger than yourself. Not only can you be a part of the project by funding them but by letting them know if there is a story that needs to be told or a scenic view that needs to be admired.</p>

<h3>The Beginning</h3>
<p>After many years of playing guitar and other instruments I went on from playing to building musical equipment. Since the beginning of 2011 I am building my own guitareffects because i couldn't find the right sounds. I spent most of my time in the local musicstores, to find that what i was seeking. So if you can't find it, make it!<br/><br/>So i kept trying and improving my products and started building stuff for others.<br/>I am a father / husband so i don't want to have my daily earnings as a programmer put in to my own company. We need to pay our bills and provide what ever our kids need.<br/> </p>

Most jazz fans and muisc lovers know my legendary father Roy Haynes. Anyway, I'll be performing with my new band at the Dakar Goree Jazz Festival in Dakar, Senegal in February 2016, with Jay Rodriguez on saxophone and flute, Benito Gonzalez on piano and Essiet Okon Essiet on bass (with myself on drums). We have all worked together in the past but never in this congregation. (I'll post a video of us rehearsing, as soon as we can finally be in the same place and have time). So ... being that we are extraordinary, world class musicians ...this needs to be well documented so I'm asking for help in recording and producing a CD and DVD of this project. (audio equipment, musicians and engineers payments, pre- and post production etc.) More than that, it will be my very first recording as a leader (since I passed on many such offers over the years)! This will also be my first time performing in Senegal and although I have many fans worldwide and hopefully YOU WILL become a fan, a contributor and maybe even an associate producer with me! What a great way to bring in the new year! Helping to make ""real"" great music and make the world a nicer place! <br/>
</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>We were confirmed to appear at the concert rather late and my decision to record it came even a day later, hence the urgency of this funding campaign! It will ALL be very well worth the efforts though! Who knows? The main thing is that you'll be helping some great musicians make some great music, which is part of the healing process of this planet!!</h3>

So ... being that we are extraordinary, world class musicians ...this needs to be well documented so I'm asking for help in recording and producing a CD and DVD of this project. (audio equipment, musicians and engineers payments, pre- and post production etc.) More than that, it will be my very first recording as a leader (since I passed on many such offers over the years)! This will also be my first time performing in Senegal and although I have many fans worldwide and hopefully YOU WILL become a fan, a contributor and maybe even an associate producer with me! What a great way to bring in the new year! Helping to make ""real"" great music and make the world a nicer place! 


We were confirmed to appear at the concert rather late and my decision to record it came even a day later, hence the urgency of this funding campaign! It will ALL be very well worth the efforts though! Who knows? The main thing is that you'll be helping some great musicians make some great music, which is part of the healing process of this planet!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<div>We were all born to serve a purpose, the second I was born my purpose was to create music. The entire time I've been alive, I've had a struggle whether physically mentally or what's in my heart. Since I was a child, even since I was a baby I have struggled with my health. Whether it is my Asthma, Aspergers, Liver Disease, or Juvenile Polymyositis I've struggled to over come. I've had difficulties that have brought me down more than once, but not today and hopefully never again! I am an artist believing I can make everyone around me proud, Believing I can conquer the demons that lie within.   </div>

</div><p>We as a human race are connected in more ways in one, but the base of our connection is the human soul. Is there a better way to connect to the soul than through music? 'Scary Things - EP' is more than a short album it's a stripped &amp; raw, emotional album. 'Scary Things - EP' explains our emotions as if we were all one, explains what we feel in our aching souls, no matter our color, gender, sexuality, religion, nor the amount of money we have. </p>

<h3>Tobias ben Jacob - New Album Project</h3>
<p><strong>**This Campaign is now closed.  Thank you to everyone that pledged! If you missed out and would still like to pledge I am setting up an album pre-order page soon and will post about it here and on my social media and website**</strong></p>
<p>          Hello and welcome to my Indiegogo page, if news of my fame and illustrious deeds have somehow miraculously passed you by then please let me humbly introduce myself; I am <strong>Tobias ben Jacob</strong> a Devon based singer-songwriter and I'd like to tell you about my new album project.</p>
<p>          Making a full studio album has been a long time coming and this will be the most ambitious musical project I have yet undertaken. It is going to cost money to make it properly and I would like to compliment my creative ambition with some economic and commercial ambition, although the thought of trying to raise this much money is both exciting and mildy terrifying. <strong>Help!</strong></p>
<p>        Please watch the video to find out more about the ideas behind the album. I am very excited to have the following array of friends and wonderful musicians involved: <strong>John Elliott</strong> (<i>piano, keys, laptop, co-production</i>) <strong>Phillip Henry</strong> (<i>lapsteel, electric guitar, harmonica)</i> <strong>Lukas Drinkwater</strong> <i>(</i><i>electric and upright bass</i>) <strong>Hannah Martin</strong> (<i>violin, backing vocals</i>) <strong>Tim Heymerdinger </strong><i>(</i><i>drums, percussion</i>) <strong>Emily Barker </strong>(<i>backing vocals</i>) <strong>Jess McAllister </strong>(<i>backing vocals</i>) and more to be announced..recording will be <strong>Gareth Young </strong>at Cube Studios, Cornwall.</p>
<p>         The album contains a strong biographical narrative and a strong sense of place and time. Beginning with themes based around growing up on a council estate in the North West and on into the 90's and the feelings of youth and adolescent longing on the mean streets of Preston. Further on into the present day and the cry against living a two dimensional, colourless life; <i>'Oh let me breathe, let me fly, Oh let me live a polyphonic life.'</i>  Underlying the lyrics is a broader sense that the individual is often attempting to overcome internal and external hindrances to acheive some sense of meaning, fulfillment and vocation. There are doses of grit, sadness, nostalgia, lost and unrequited love but also a strong vein of hope and optimism.</p>
<p>        There are a number of options for you to pre-order and pledge, signing up will mean you receive the album well ahead of its official release date, as well as being invited behind the scenes with videos and updates throughout pre-production and recording.</p>
<p>      Alongside the money I am raising through my own musical activities the funds raised through Indiegogo will go toward the costs of recording and mixing the album as well as compensating the musicians involved. Please help by sharing the campaign on your social media.</p>
<p>                                           Many Thanks,</p>

make a no perk contribution for the correct amount</h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Can you believe that we've been a band for 13 years 
and counting? We've finally decided to take matters into our own hands 
and want to raise money for the album directly from the people who have 
helped keep this band going all these years. In this time, we've release
 3 full length albums, a live DVD/CD, as well as an EP and a 7 inch. 
We've toured all over the world (but still wanting to check off more 
destinations and visit more places) and pretty much lived and breathed 
this band as long as we've been in existence.</p>
<p>We are finally free from all obligations and want to 
be in control of our “careers”. In general, the record industry is 
backwards and we'd be stupid to renegotiate with anyone at this time. 
Crowdfunding seems to be something that's working. Whether or not this 
is the next thing for the music industry, it's a way that supporters of a
 band can know exactly where their hard earned dollars are going. No 
middlemen, no commissions, no bullshit.</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Over the last couple months, we kept our ears to the 
ground, watched other people use this method and actually succeed. There
 have been many different approaches and fans of music are starting to 
understand this format, but it's lacking something. Bands and artists 
don't show you how the money gets spent.</p>
<p>We however, will account to you to show you how every
 penny is spent and prove that making a top notch record comes at a 
price. Who knows, if we exceed our goal we will be able to do things we 
may have only dreamed about. Essentially, the success of this campaign 
will determine how amazing this record will become. We are set up for 
Flex Funding which means if we don't reach our goal, we are still 
getting the money that is raised. So, if we don't reach our goal, we 
will have to reevaluate how we are planning to do this record. 
Regardless, we are ready to deliver this thing however our campaign 
plays out.</p>
<p><strong>Remember, anything that is available through 
the perks is exclusive to the campaign. The CD Digipak, Gatefold Vinyl, 
and Tshirt are all one time offers. None of them will ever be printed 
again in this way.</strong></p>

I've said a lot in the video but basically I am making an EP this fall with my friend Belinda who will be producing it. She is amazing and I'm looking forward to working with her again. God has been bringing the different pieces together for this project and I am truly amazed thus far.</div><div> </div><div>
<p>A few months ago I was able to release 'Faithful (Through It All)' and it will be the title track of this 4 song EP. The rest of the songs were written this past year at various points in my life. They are extremely personal but I am looking forward to be able to share them and my prayer is that people who listen to it will know and experience the goodness and faithfulness of God in their lives. This past year has been really hard but I've realized that we can sing even in the midst of pain and God doesn't leave, ever. One of the most tangible signs of life for me in this season has been these songs that I've been able to write. It's interesting how pain has a way of bringing things to the surface.</p>
<p>I would love to include you in this project with me and am estimating this EP to be done early 2018.</p>
</div><div>
<p>The funds raised will cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Recording, production and mastering ($1,500)</li>
<li>Copyright fee and digital distribution ($200)</li>
<li>Making of CD's ($300)</li>

<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>Money is not the only challenge. We are losing the culture and diversity of live big band music as DJ's and electronics take over the main stage. As a San Diego's Jazz Orchestra, we want to educate students and our local community that some of the best form of entertainment is when multiple musicians can connect to an audience. This conversation between musician and listener creates a positive emotion that is impossible to replicate with computerized music. Big Band is America's creation of live entertainment.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We are SLOWKISS - a 4-piece band - 2 girls and 2 dudes. We make alternative punk rock music, and we do our best to 'bring it' for our audience at every show we play and on every song we record.</p>
<p>Since we're an independent band, we face lots of expenses that we pay for 100% out-of-pocket, including recording, marketing/promoting our music, traveling, gear, and lots more. This time around, with our new EP, we need YOUR support.<br/><br/>ULTRAVIOLET is our brand new EP - five explosive songs that will surprise you in the best of ways.

<p>WHICH REPERTOIRE IS INCLUDED?</p>
<p>All my pieces for cello and piano: <i>The Philosophy of Composition</i> (2009), after Edgar Allan Poe's essay of the same title and a memorial to the South African poet Don Maclennan; a brand new <i>Sonata for cello and piano</i> (2016); and two short pieces - <i>Connectivity</i> (2008), composed for the Messiaen centenary, and an early <i>song without words</i> (1975). </p>
<p>Two substantial solo pieces: <i>Pentimenti</i> for solo cello (2013), marking the centenary of the riotous premiere of 'The Rite of Spring'; <i>A Fractured Landscape for piano</i> (2010), a memorial to the writer and musician Edward Said.</p>
<p>Two 'lagnappes': <i>the richter scale</i> and <i>Seventh Must Fall </i>for solo cello and solo piano respectively.</p>
<p>WHO AM I?</p>
<p>A Cape Town born composer, I also studied in Johannesburg and London, and received a doctorate in composition from Rhodes University in 2000. I moved to London in 1977 to continue my career as composer, pianist, teacher, writer and new music activist, returning in 1998 after the advent of democracy in South Africa. There I set up ""Growing Composers"", a programme for mentoring young black composers, and an annual festival, ""New Music Indaba"", for the performance of new music. The artists on this CD are among a number from around the world who have visited South Africa to give concerts and workshops. My overriding ambitions were twofold: to get previously disadvantaged composers onto the new music scene and to get South African new music onto the international stage. </p>
<p>My two previous CDs collected my solo piano music up to 2004 (Jill Richards) and my string quartets and piano quintet (Fitzwilliam String Quartet), and were praised in the South African, British and German press. You can read reviews and more about me at <a href=""http://www.michaelblake.co.za"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.michaelblake.co.za</a>.</p>

<p>WHAT IMPACT COULD THIS CD HAVE?</p>
<p>The CD recording of my complete cello music is a terrific opportunity to showcase another aspect of my music. And having it played by such committed artists takes the experience to another level for me. South African composers do not often have this opportunity and I would hope that the next generation might see this as a model and inspiration for what is possible.</p>
<p>Your contributions will quite simply make it possible to turn many months of creative hard work by the composer and the performers into a beautiful and long-lasting end product, one that listeners will appreciate and will definitely want to have in their CD libraries.</p>

<p><strong>Hi, dear Friends - Happy New Year 2018!</strong></p>
<p>My name is Viktoria Elisabeth Kaunzner, I am a violin soloist, composer, poet and professor of violin at Kangnam University in South Korea.I grew up in Bavaria and did lots of skiing in my childhood. I was trained by the Vice-World Team Champion in Biathlon Martin Rossberger in Longline Skating.</p>
<p>I studied with famous violin professor Zakhar Bron (who was also teacher of David Garrett) in Cologne, Berlin, Paris and N.Y. In the famous Berlin Konzerthaus I sang the ""Psalm Symphony"" by Stravinsky. I sang and played the violin in Berlin´s Jazz Club B-Flat.</p>
<p>In 2017 I composed a crossover song. There I sing and play the violin. The title is ""Lucid Dreams"" and I cooperate in the production process with Munich based Ennio Tangocci.</p>
<p>In this Crossover Song I want to express specific shades of love – globally - in the 21st century. It means also hate in a very special way: Key word: artificial intelligence. This idea was so spontaneous so I wrote the lyrics during a Chopin piano concerto and step by step the song architecture was created. This song also shows my great appreciation and love to South Korea where the Winter Olympic Games will take place in one month.</p>
<p>This song is worth a really, really good music recording production after the preproduction you can already hear in the crowd funding vimeo video. We recorded it with a simple microphone in Ennio´s studio. We want to borrow a high quality microphone and record the song again in a great concert hall (e.g. Konzerthaus Blaibach). For a round, unique sound design I will cooperate with specialists from Berlin.</p>
<p><strong>The song „Lucid Dreams“ screams for a unique music video production which will be streamed during the Winter Olympic Games in South Korea.</strong></p>
<p>Four main scenes are planned:</p>
<p>1. main character who draws a ski jumper</p>
<p>2. party scenes</p>
<p>3. winter ski jumps (from shutter stock internet video platform)</p>
<p>4. violin/ voice (Viktoria)</p>
<p>5. animation (artificial intelligence)</p>
<p>At the Munich Tanzwerkstatt, an international festival for dancers I met in 2017 Beate Brömse, a  lady artist. She will perform as main character and also draw some scenes. The video needs animation for the skiing scenes and the artificial intelligence topic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Your support is needed to make this song a unique single.</strong></p>
<p>5% of the fundings will be donated to ""Raphael´s House"" in South Korea for blind and deaf orphans. I´ve played for them concerts, one of the most moving moments in my entire music life.</p>
<p>As a ""Merci"" you will receive ""Perks"" - individually designed by myself and many of them shipped from South Korea.<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">  </span></p>
<p><font>""Lucid Dreams"" is composed with Oriental, Asian-Minimalism, House, Classic, Pop and Jazz elements. I want to show the world the importance of true love besides any ""cyber love"" or relationship artificial intelligence ""dream monsters"". If we are not sensitive for these topics, artificial intelligence and: super artificial intelligence will destroy the planet.</font></p>

<p><strong>My crowdfunding history</strong></p>
<p>The crowd funding campaign ""Les Furies"" for my third CD was great support to cover basic costs to release this enormous work of the Six Solo Sonatas by Eugène Ysaÿe and my satire ""Sojuchameleon"" for violin &amp; field recordings (Hänssler Classic). The CD received best international reviews. American Record Guide counts it among the top 3 recordings of all Six Ysaÿe Sonatas in the world. It is my third CD which is nominated for the prestigious Echo-Klassik CD award, SO I´d love to say ""Merci"" for your support and trust. I love recording sessions and choose carefully, WHICH program with whom I want to record and WHY.</p>
</div><div>As a classical violinist and composer it might be strange for some conservative fans or classical music lovers that I want to publish a crossover-fusion song.

It is my third CD which is nominated for the prestigious Echo-Klassik CD award, SO I´d love to say ""Merci"" for your support and trust. I love recording sessions and choose carefully, WHICH program with whom I want to record and WHY.
As a classical violinist and composer it might be strange for some conservative fans or classical music lovers that I want to publish a crossover-fusion song. I think and I feel it is a MUSTfor me beacuse I lived for over six years in another culture which I admire and also criticize in some aspects, as well as I regard carefully what happens in Europe within these days.My mission and vision is to create vital, energetic music, also for younger persons to show them the key to the philosophical world of classical music.  It would be fabulous of you to support this campaign.Please forward this Indiegogo link to your friends, share the passion for it.Thank you so much! Cordially,Viktoria ​Here you find the budget plan in Euros:needed  9900 Euros 1.

<p><i>""I want to sing like the birds sing, not worrying about who hears and what they think."" -Rumi</i></p>
<h3>Here's My Story:</h3>
<p>I have been singing and making original Jewish <font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">music for 18 years, creating albums like ""Miriam's Drum"", (world music based on Hebrew chants), and ""The Water Castle"", (a Kabbalistic Rock Opera based on a Chassidic fairy tale). I have performed, primarily for women, </span>across<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> Israel, North America, and as far as Moscow, leading a movement of women creating music for women, as part of a </span>Renaissance<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> of Jewish Women's expression.  </span></font><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">As a musician and Chaplain, the connection between music and healing is my passion. I have lived for many years in the holy city of Tzfat, where I record, perform, and work for the non-profit Music &amp; Memory, providing personalized music to the elderly. A recent and traumatic life shake up left me starting over at age 40, with two little girls and a newborn baby in tow. <i> (you can read more about that here: <a href=""https://thelayersprojectmagazine.com/learning-that-i-deserve-love-and-finding-my-voice/?fbclid=IwAR2jnuoM7xz71WJGNO7yz78lv6R-ut561zgac0l9k7vPwpHTXd54GGhvfKs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://thelayersprojectmagazine.com/learning-that-i-deserve-love-and-finding-my-voice/?fbclid=IwAR2jnuoM7xz71WJGNO7yz78lv6R-ut561zgac0l9k7vPwpHTXd54GGhvfKs</a>) </i></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Out of the ashes rose this music, my re-connection and soul love affair with the ancient Persian Poet, Rumi. I feel that the universal nature of Rumi's poetry, sung in English, can make his work accessible to many, and finally be a breakthrough album in my musical journey, allowing me to spread my message of the healing power of music. My dream is that this music with help heal  on both personal and social levels, creating a common language of the heart that transcends boundaries and mends divisions. Singing together, awakening together, connects people like no other kind of communication.</span></p>
<p><strong>How it all began</strong><br/><br/>A couple of years ago, I was creating a Spiritual Care workshop for Arab, Jewish, and Russian health care workers in Israel, and was challenged to find spiritual teachings that are universal and inspiring. I had read Rumi's poetry years before during a serious study of Persian classical singing, and had always felt that his words awakened my soul in very direct and trans-formative way. After becoming religious, and moving to Israel, I had lost touch somewhat with his work, but the moment I returned to his startlingly clear, mind-blowing way of expressing the Soul's search (and find), I was struck by these melodies as if by lightening. They commanded my total focus and attention, and they just kept coming, one after another. The songs have been resonating within me ever since. I have sung them many times, in many places over the past few years, and they have an expansive and trans-formative affect on me, the musicians I play with, and listeners, who become part of the music by singing along to the cyclical, heart-centering chants.<font><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">  I have teamed up with some of the best Israeli musicians, such as Shye Ben Tzur, to create a classical album of lasting value, which I pray will do justice to Rumi's heart-opening words of inclusion, faith, and trust. Eastern and Western instruments and rhythms combine seamlessly, with lots of live playing and improvisation, in the healing 432 </span>Hz<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> tuning, to bring what I hope is a ground breaking collection of songs to a world in need of uplift and inspiration.</span></font></p>

<h3>What I Need/What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>I need $5000 to finish the album, plus another  $13,000 for post production, marketing, and a video to make get the music out. I have poured all of my financial resources, which has been difficult as a single mother, into the album so far. It is not enough to just make the music; people need to know about this project, and that takes funding to do it right. This music deserves to be created, and marketed, in a high quality way. </li>
<li>Support will get a variety of perks, like: digital downloads, signed hard copies of the album, advanced download of my newest, upcoming single, ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"", a complete box set of my CDs, online one on one meetings for singing classes and guided imagery sessions, and in the case of big donors, dedications to loved ones on the CD itself.</li>
<li>Whatever I earn will go directly to the project, getting me as close to my goal as possible. The first funding with go towards completion of recording, mixing and mastering, graphic design, photography, printing, and digital distribution. Beyond that, funds will be used for making an AMAZING music video to publicize the album. More funding will make it possible to push the video and album on social media and YouTube, as well as creating a professional marketing campaign, with media impact, hopefully leading to articles, interviews, and eventually, a tour to promote the album. The full amount will allow me to finish the album and give it a significant push out into the world.</li>

<h3>A New Kind of Music</h3>
<p>I have been creating music for many years. Check out my track record of fresh, cutting edge world music. I have always been grass roots in my approach, and have never had the opportunity to really market my work. My most recent project was a music video, that reached over 50k views, which showed me what is possible when dedication and funding meet. Your donation will help me to give this work the chance it needs to really open hearts across the world, and spread a message of hope for our continued coexistence on the planet, feeding a spiritual hunger that is nearly universal, the world over, in our disconnect, often virtual worlds. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Oh Lord, Please Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood</h3>
<p>Some people may not understand why I am doing this project. My Jewish audience may question my decision to focus on a Sufi poet. After all, many consider Jews and Muslims to be enemies, and certainly there is room for more communication, connection and love between our peoples. Some might object to my music simply because of my address: Northern Israel. Some might accuse me of cultural appropriation, in my drawing on the poems of a different spiritual tradition for inspiration. Some religious Jews will insist that my time would be better spent on promoting artistic works based on our Jewish Tradition. The fact is, this album may not be understood, and I, in turn, may not be understood artistically for making it. I might loose fans, or be a victim of racism from either side. Antisemitism is breaking out all over the world; putting myself out publicly could draw attention I might regret. Perhaps it would have been safer to use my money to buy a little house for me and my kids, and put aside this dream of making what I believe with be my most powerful album to date, or stay safe in Jewish themes and my small but dedicated following? But that is not my path. As Rumi wrote, <strong><i>“Run from what's comfortable. Forget safety. Live where you fear to live. Destroy your reputation. Be notorious. I have tried prudent planning long enough. From now on I'll be mad.”</i></strong> I hope you will join with me cause art is beyond religion, beyond language, and music itself predates creation according to the Jewish tradition. I'm following the call of my heart. I hope this music, when finished will soothe, inspire, cracking open our hearts to let the light in....and out. I just have to keep singing my songs, and hope that more and more people from all walks of life will sing along, and find a common harmony. </p>

<p><br/><strong>Bringing Healing on Many Levels</strong><br/><br/>There are so many ways this music can benefit the world. First of all for every person who hears the songs and is reminded of the Heart pulsing within creation. So much of our world is focused on what separates us as individuals, as nations, as men and women. But at heart we have so much commonality; it is my hope and prayer that these songs will be part of the healing force in the Universe that helps to humanize and reveal our common ground as the sub-set of humans I call Rumi People. There are many of us. Just read a few lines of Rumi's poetry to find out if you are a member of this tribe.  I envision festivals and gatherings where we can come together to share the hopes, dreams and visions that unite us; in song. This music is also going to be good for healing treatments, meditation, and prayer. Rather than a frontal listening experience, the music surrounds, enlivens, and also rises from within each of our hearts and souls. All are welcome. As the poem says,<br/><br/><strong><i>""Come, come, whoever you are. Wanderer, idolater, worshiper of fire. Come even though you have broken your vows a thousand times. Come and come yet again, ours is not a caravan of despair."" -Rumi</i></strong></p>

<p>Juan Bond has been a project I have been trying to get off the ground since 2013. Starting out as more or less a solo project, it has evolved into a collective of musicians rallying around one idea; Making music that pushes boundaries and pushes people out of their comfort zone, especially us. This is the first full-length I have ever released that features my own compositions and songs and it's incredibly meaningful to me. Help us out and join the Bond family!</p>
</div><div>
<p>We're looking to cover some of the recording and mixing/mastering process while getting you all some cool swag and experiences. We are attempting to keep costs as low as possible for both ours and your benefit. </p>
<p>Approximately these are our pretty straightforward costs:</p>
<p>$3000 for recording and mixing/mastering </p>
<p>$2000 for all new merch (shirts, records, etc) and to cover various unexpected costs that always seem to show up.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If you choose to contribute to our campaign, you would truly be helping this band continue on. Passion projects unfortunately can be quite costly and this is something we truly cannot fund on our own. There are no trust funds, industry connects, or labels supporting us; we are on our own with this.

<h3>The Deplorable Choir Story </h3>
<p>Country music, along with the rest of the entertainment industry are in crisis. American values are eroding away in our entertainment culture and those who still hold them are silenced. Country music stars by the numbers have withdrawn their support from the NRA, and are continuously pushed in a politically progressive direction. </p>
<p>What started out as a fun hobby in our living room just singing songs about President Trump has turned into a full blown passion. We've now toured the United States, Sang at two Trump rallies, and have even been featured on Fox News. Now, we hope to take our success and make it even louder with a number one album on iTunes. If we can get Nashville's attention, we know there will be other artists who see our success and realize they WILL be successful if they are UNASHAMED with their conservative values. We need MORE God and guns in country, not less. It will be a domino effect that will help turn the entire industry back to its roots, and give voice to the artists who thought they had to be silent or risk losing it all. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>As we like to say, ""Join the Choir.""</h3>
<p>Breaking it down for ya:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need to raise the funds for a quality album and music videos and be able to promote it to compete with the best in Nashville. If we raise enough, we hope to do a radio tour as well.</li>
<li>We want you to be involved in the process: be included on the album insert, participate in team phone calls, and even have us for a house concert in your city...or ours! </li>
<li>Even if we don't raise all the money, we will still put what we have towards the completion of our album and any promotion necessary  to positively impact the entertainment industry. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Feel free to explain more about your campaign and let people know the difference their contribution will make:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our success will impact artists in Nashville. There is a fear attached with boldly being a conservative in the entertainment industry. It is very normal to lose business or be black listed. Artists have been forced to apologize just for supporting Trump.</li>
<li>If we are wildly successful with being unapologetically conservative Trump supporters, people will emulate, which is what we hope they do. Hey, sometimes it just takes someone bold enough to lead the pack and secure our conservative values for generations to come. </li>
<li>We know its already working! We have seen more and more people coming out with what we like to call ""MAGA Music"" and we do believe we are recognized as the first but we definitely don't want to be the last!</li>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Hi Friends,</span></h3>
<p>This is an exciting time. I'm finally going to record an album that is years in the making. </p>
<p>I've been writing songs ever since I picked up a guitar as a teenager. Since those early days I've been creating and honing a sound and catalogue of songs. This album will be my first chance to truly share some of my songs to a larger audience.</p>
<p>As a Kamloops, BC based singer-songwriter I've been playing shows around BC's interior for the past couple of years. In the last year I've been very fortunate to have connected with two fabulous veteran local musicians Brendan Methot (drums) and Duff Friedricksen (keyboards/bass). These guys are awesome. The three of us have been diligently rehearsing and honing our sound for this album and are excited to get into the studio. </p>
<p>The plan is record it all live-off-the-floor just like some of the best rock records have been done in the past. We're a band that plays live and I want it to capture our dynamics and feel.  I'm an old soul that is heavily influenced by the first generation of what is now called classic rock and I want to incorporate elements from those influences. All I've got to say is there will be a Hammond organ run through a real Leslie rotating speaker. (It's okay if you don't know what that means, just know that it's gonna sound awesome!).</p>
<p>Any contribution to this project would mean the world to me. I've been hiding in a basement playing guitar and writing songs for years. It's time to get out and share the music with the world now. Either way, I'm going to do it. But a little help a long the way would be awesome!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your contribution will go towards studio time, mixing/editing, and mastering. The album will be recorded at a local studio in downtown Kamloops. Any additional funding will go towards publishing, promoting, and an album release party. The album will be released in February of 2020.</p>
<p>If you would like to contribute, pick your reward (in the column to the right). Thank you so much!!!</p>
<p>If it's not possible to contribute financially, that's okay. You can still help! Please take the time to follow me on Facebook and Instagram and share this campaign on indiegogo with everyone you know! </p>

<p> </p>
<h3>About the Name</h3>
<p>Hi! I am MelismaticWitch. I am an indie music producer and performer. As trained as a classical pianist for many years, classical music is deeply influential to me. The history of Western Classical Music is a great example of exploring emotional expression in art. We use music to express thoughts, meanings, feelings, and so much more. </p>
<p>I came up with this name because of Renaissance music. Melismatic singing is a style where one syllable is sung over several or even dozens of musical notes. It is more expressive, decorative, and freer in expression, compared with the syllabic style. To me, Melisma embodies a tradition, as well as a discovering path to translate mind to music. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1575347125/w5wdpnzdvazjwrlsbitb.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In Future Witch, I wish to blend different musical elements together, especially apply compositional ideas from classical music to electronic music. I hope to have the ""magic"" to manipulate time by music. That is how I came up with <i>MelismaticWitch</i>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I started to learn classical piano when I was 6. I used to stay half-day at school and half-day practising. After several years of training, I wanted to continue my music study so I went to Oberlin and Juilliard. During all these years of training, music becomes more and more important to me as a life companion rather than just a major field. I gradually realized that besides classical music, there are many other styles that I am yet not familiar with, so I decided to write my own songs. </p>
<p>I enjoy listening to different styles of music and I am fascinated by their uniqueness. This album is my first album of song production. The style is primarily future bass. But I hope to keep getting familiar with other genres of electronic music as well in future albums. </p>

It is an initiative of young Venezuelan oboists who, having begun their studies of the instrument in our country and then developed their musical career in other parts of the world, have felt the need to group together in order to give continuity to the heritage of those who with great sacrifice and dedication previously taught the instrument to the current generations and spread the scope of the repertoire, as well as its potential in Venezuela.</p><p>Through this project, homage is paid to Teachers and Masters who, during the last decades, have laid with dignity the foundations of a Venezuelan Oboe School that today assumes important scenarios in the world. This recognition of the legacy of our Teachers, coupled with the experience acquired by the current teaching team, serves as a generating seed with the objective of rescuing and creating spaces for the exchange and debate of ideas; the assumption of new responsibilities; the development of teamwork; and the commitment to the instrument, its learning and the artistic possibilities it offers. What it is about, is to build values ​​through an emancipator pedagogical process and to configure an alternative music scene that offers young people who participate in the project, tools and perspectives that allow them to assume a critical/self-critical practice and expand their musical and artistic interests in free and spontaneous form.</p><p>THE OBOE AND ITS LABYRINTHS is the constant development of solutions to questions that arise in the perennial path of learning, of knowledge. Each question is the means that travel the paths of the labyrinths of the Oboe and each solution is the impulse of a new beginning. For us, the labyrinths of the Oboe are that complex world as a synthesis of multiple determinations, a world that is constituted from the unity of the diverse and that finds the resolution of its contradictions in heterodox exits that have become endless practices and possibilities.</p><p>THE OBOE AND ITS LABYRINTHS stands today in current Venezuela as a kind of Oasis of Dignity, which offers to the present generations, selflessly and detached, the idea to ​​continue dreaming and fighting for a new dawn full of hope and solidarity. The idea-force that from music reality can be transformed, is a motivation sin ne qua non of this beautiful project, which despite the harsh adversities and tangible difficulties, it rises and persists with the desire to break the chains of resignation and lethargy. THE OBOE AND ITS LABYRINTHS is a hurricane of disciplined effort that, with sincere love and fibrous commitment, reaches out to hundreds of young Venezuelans to use the art of sound as a means to dream and emancipate.</p><p> </p><p><strong>BALANCE</strong></p><p>THE OBOE AND ITS LABYRINTHS begins with its first edition on March 2017 in the city of Caracas, with a couple of Concerts and a series of master classes directed to young people from different regions of the country. The opportunity served as a way to make a diagnosis of the situation of the Oboe in Venezuela.</p><p>The severe economic crisis and the dramatic social situation, without fear of doubt, upset every dimension of national life. Educational institutions in the artistic field do not escape this, especially when the substantive absence of teachers is noted.</p><p>In that sense, the group of young oboists who launch this initiative in a selfless and altruistic way, decides to give it continuity in order to attend more than a hundred young people who, in the framework of so many adversities, had decided bravely and consequently to assume the path of Music and, particularly of the Oboe as a means for human redemption.</p><p>Since then, EL OBOE AND ITS LABYRINTHS has attended, during the course of more than six editions and other satellite monitoring activities - from March 2017 to November 2019 - more than 120 young people from different regions of Venezuela between the ages of 10 and 25 years, without distinction of political ideologies, sex, religion or social class.</p><p>In this orientation, THE OBOE AND ITS LABYRINTHS have two fundamental aspects. The first one is the ACADEMIC TRAINING of students with the highest standards, and with a vision of inner search for their artistic identity. The facilitators materialize that fact through the required necessary discipline in the course of the entire event, both in the previous phase of preparation, with the assignment of works and comprehending the needs of each student, the sending of audition videos with the highest quality possible during its recording, as in the fulfillment of the lapses and the assigned tasks. Subsequently, the interaction with the different facilitators begins, with individual and group classes, analysis of the works and their respective historical context, classes about the technical base in the execution of the Oboe, individual and group workshops for the elaboration of reeds, preparation of important solos for orchestras, rehearsals with pianists, cembalists, chamber groups and everything that contributes to the improvement of the qualities of each student.</p><p>The second aspect is the ARTISTIC DEVELOPMENT, linked, of course, to the aspects mentioned before. The oboists are presented to the public in a solo recital format, accompanied by piano or cembalo, with chamber groups and with orchestra according to the chosen repertoire, first, before their own colleagues and then, in open concerts and recitals. This gives them confidence in the knowledge acquired and shapes their artistic being. It also highlights the participation of teachers in concerts and multidisciplinary events for the benefit of students and the public, by introducing them to a large number of new or rarely executed works, expanding the interpretive horizon of all of the participants.</p><p>The proposal of THE OBOE AND ITS LABYRINTHS has achieved, over the course of its more than six editions, to establish alliances with institutions that have been of vital importance for the successful realization of this project. Among them we have the FUNDACIÓN TEATRO TERESA CARREÑO, the FUNDAMUSICAL SIMÓN BOLIVAR, the SCHOOL OF ARTS OF THE CENTRAL UNIVERSITY OF VENEZUELA, the GALLERY OF NATIONAL ART, the ART CENTER “LA ESTANCIA”, the LATIN AMERICAN STUDIES CENTER “RÓMMOSALL” and the ""LOS GALPONES"" ART CENTER.</p><p>However, it is worth saying that absolutely all the activities that have been programmed and carried out by the Organizing Committee, have been self-managed with their own means and the help of friends who have jointly contributed their grain of sand to achieve modest resources destined to organizing the aforementioned activities.</p><p>The painful economic situation of our country, the institutional crisis and the social drama, prevent us from obtaining financial assistance for this initiative in Venezuela. However, the aforementioned alliances have been fundamental for the realization of academic and artistic activities, as these institutions - public and private - have provided their spaces free of charge, for the completion of this beautiful dream.</p><p>Without the help of friends, colleagues, students, fathers and mothers, and institutions such as those mentioned above, THE OBOE AND ITS LABYRINTHS would not be possible. Likewise, it should be noted that the members of the Organizing Committee participate in educational, artistic and organizational activities without profit, making all their efforts a way to give back real and tangible compensation to the country that gave them birth. Similarly, it should be emphasized that absolutely all academic and artistic activities are free and freely accessible, thus allowing the inclusion of vulnerable and disadvantaged subjects.</p><p>The achieved results are extraordinary. On every edition of the project, there has been an increment on the number of students who approach our proposal with great motivation and enthusiasm. That drives us to continue this work in favor of the community of Venezuelan oboists eager for this space of debate, collective construction, joint learning and the projection of a broad and heterodox look on music translated into the sound of the oboe.</p><p>Likewise, through more than twenty artistic activities between recitals, concerts and interdisciplinary performances, this project has become a consolidated reference in the city of Caracas, where hundreds of people from all walks of life and fields of action actively participate, configuring an alternative musical scene which is extremely attractive to audiences in our country.</p><p>The perspective has been magnified and the horizon has widened.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges </h3>
<p>             Une aventure n'est jamais sans risque ni défi. Quand j'ai débuté le projet pour le nouvel album et le nouveau spectacle, je savais que ce serait un grand pas. Je me sens si bien à créer et j'ai tant de plaisir à le faire, mais comme tout sentiers que nous prenons dans la vie, il y a des obstacles.</p>
<p>              Après plusieurs années à composer, écrire et jouer dans différents endroits, j'ai reconnu mes obstacles dans la solitude, le jugement, le sentiment d'être à l'écart, me remettre en question, prendre des risques financiers, ne pas être payé. J’ai appris comment faire face à ces défis. J'ai compris comment les utiliser pour être encore plus créatif et j'ai découvert tout l'amour et le soutien que j'ai autour de moi.</p>
<p>               Par la persévérance et le courage, je me suis construit une confiance et acquis des connaissances que j'utilise maintenant pour atteindre mon but.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>              An adventure is never possible without risks and challenges. When I started this project I knew it will be a big step. I feel really good creating and I have so much fun doing it, but as in every trail you walk in your life, there will be obstacles.</p>
<p>              After few years composing, writing, playing in different places, I recognized my hurdles in loneliness, judgement, feeling apart, questioning myself, taking risks financially, not being paid. Time taught me how to solved these challenges and understanding how to use these circumstances to be more creative and discover how much love and support I actually have around me.</p>
<p>              By perseverance and courage, I have builded a confidence and a knowledge that I now use to achieve my goal. </p>

J’ai appris comment faire face à ces défis. J'ai compris comment les utiliser pour être encore plus créatif et j'ai découvert tout l'amour et le soutien que j'ai autour de moi.
               Par la persévérance et le courage, je me suis construit une confiance et acquis des connaissances que j'utilise maintenant pour atteindre mon but.
 
              An adventure is never possible without risks and challenges. When I started this project I knew it will be a big step. I feel really good creating and I have so much fun doing it, but as in every trail you walk in your life, there will be obstacles.
              After few years composing, writing, playing in different places, I recognized my hurdles in loneliness, judgement, feeling apart, questioning myself, taking risks financially, not being paid. Time taught me how to solved these challenges and understanding how to use these circumstances to be more creative and discover how much love and support I actually have around me.
              By perseverance and courage, I have builded a confidence and a knowledge that I now use to achieve my goal.

<h3>A Personal Story</h3>
<p>I love music, and every Friday my friends and I would enjoy playing covers of bands we liked in garages and practice studios. I loved guitar and practiced the guitar parts of my favorite bands every day in my high school years.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603324867/nxqcdhnhqrftppggjbt0.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p>
<p>One day, we decided that we should start making our own original songs, and as the guitarist, I decided to try my hand at songwriting.<br/><br/>I could play to a certain extent, and was fine with chords and even complicated melodies or speedy shredding. I had imagined a melody in my head, and tried to play it on my guitar. However, I had no idea what to play to get the sound I was imagining. I could hear the melody in my head, but even with guitar playing skills, I was unable play what I was hearing. Frustrated by this experience, I wasn't able to create the song.</p>
<p>However, I noticed that I was able to hum or sing the melody to myself, and realized that even if I can't play the guitar or piano, if there were an app that could pick up what I was humming, I would be able to create songs on my own.<br/><br/>There were other apps with the idea to create music with one's voice, but they required one to connect to other software or weren't able to pick up the voice properly, and weren't suitable for songwriting. On the other hand, HummingBand's sound is on average 80% accurate, and the second page allows one to adjust aberrations in sound, meaning you can recreate the melody you imagine with 100% perfection.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Future Plans</h3>
<p><u><strong>Phase 2:</strong></u><br/><br/>The app can offer chord progressions that match the melodies sung by the user, as the chord progression that will fit a certain melody is to a certain extent fixed.<br/>Offering suggested chord progressions allows beginners to come one step closer to the songwriting experience. Experts will of course be able to choose their own original chord progressions.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603327301/jscjq9tavvjotxvobczd.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/><u><strong>Phase 3:</strong></u><br/><br/>AI will perform the instruments accompanying the original melody. The user will sing one's own original melody and lyrics, choose the instruments and genre (rock, jazz, blues, etc.), and whether the song should be upbeat or dark, and the AI will perform accordingly.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Development progress</h3>
<p><br/>I came up with the idea for HummingBand in college. The dream of developing the app was put on hold when I started working, but, never giving up on that dream, I decided to make new progress. The app is currently under development, and has achieved 80% accuracy in sound reproduction. Currently I am working on raising this level to 90%, and moving on to Phase 2.<br/><br/>The backend is being developed with C++, and UI/UX with Swift (iPhone) and Java (Android), while simultaneously working on the icons and designs for the app.<br/><br/>From now on, requests to testers, design planning, development, marketing, and legal advisory costs will be necessary.</p>
<h3> </h3>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As long as funding is acquired, up until Phase 2 can be released. Phase 3 is theoretically possible, but it's still unknown what level of quality can be achieved.</p>
<h3>Funding Needs</h3>
<p>We are seeking to raise $20,000 to support the development and marketing of HummingBand. The breakdown of the required funding is as follows:<br/><br/>$20,000 - Complete the design and development of Phase 1 for iPhone and Android plus three months of maintenance &amp; support, marketing and promotion costs and legal fees.</p>
<p><strong>Funding Goal Met!</strong></p>
<p>Goal Extension<br/>$30,000 - Complete the design and development of Phase 2<br/>$40,000 - Complete the design and development of Phase 3</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>アプリの概要</h3>
<p>自分だけのオリジナルのメロディを頭の中で考えたことはありませんか？</p>
<p>自分が楽器を演奏している姿を想像したことはありませんか？</p>
<p>HummingBandは、頭の中に思い描いた音楽を実際の音にするアプリです。</p>
<p>HummingBandを使えば、楽器が弾けなくても、音楽理論の知識が全然なくても、自分の創造性をカタチにして、このコロナ渦に自宅で気軽に一人で曲を作れます。自宅にいながらにして、世界を動かすミュージシャンになれる日も近い？！</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603324633/ykclx7tmu1ul0getilzf.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>HummingBandとは？</h3>
<p>HummingBandほど正確に人の声を読み取れるアプリは他にはありません。</p>
<p>人の声は、楽器や機械の音に比べて非常に不安定な音ですが、HummingBandは、人の声を正確に読み取れちゃうアプリなんです。</p>
<p>HummingBandは、鼻歌を歌ったり、口笛を吹いたり、歌ったりするだけで、オリジナルのメロディを好きな楽器の音で再現できるアプリです。</p>
<p>人間の声は、楽器や機械の音に比べて非常に不安定な音です。しかし、HummingBandアプリはAIを使った独自のディープラーニングを活用し、原音に80％以上の忠実な音データを生成します。 ピッチ、音量、長さなども忠実に再現されています。</p>
<p>このアプリは、iPhoneとAndroidの両方に対応します。</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>機能のご紹介</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1604361701/wvtz4rgcysd2zjsvsfyc.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p><strong><u>​Page2:</u></strong></p>
<p>アプリの最初のページでは、80%以上の音を作り出すことができます。しかし、環境(アンビエント)音や外音などのノイズ音を完全に消去するには新たな開発が必要です。(みんなのサポートが必要です)そのため、データはMIDIブロックに変換します。(ここはちょっと技術的な話)</p>
<p>このアプリを使うと、音痴の人でも音程を変えたり、ノイズ音を削除したり、足りない音を追加したりして、イメージ通りの曲を作ることができたりします。</p>

<h3>パーソナルストーリー</h3>
<p>私は音楽大好少年で、毎週金曜日は友達とガレージや練習スタジオなどで好きなバンドのカバーを練習していました。音楽が大好きで、高校時代は好きなバンドのギターパートを練習に明け暮れる毎日。</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603324867/nxqcdhnhqrftppggjbt0.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>ある日、「そろそろ自分たちのオリジナル曲を作ろう」ということになり、ギタリストとして曲作りに挑戦する、という一大決心を実行。</p>
<p>ギターのスキル自体は、コードや複雑なメロディや速弾きを弾くことも出来たのですが、実際に作曲しようとしたところ、頭の中にあるメロディーをギターで弾くことが出来ませんでした。</p>
<p>頭の中ではメロディーは聞こえてはいるものの、仮にギターの弾き方はわかっても、聞こえている音をそのまま弾く、というのがなかなかできません。これに苛立ちを覚え、曲を作ることができなかったんでかなり歯がゆい思いをしたのを覚えてます。</p>
<p>しかし、自分でメロディを歌えることに気づき、ギターやピアノが弾けなくても、鼻歌を歌っているところを拾ってくれるアプリがあれば、自分で曲を作ることができるのではないかと、思ったのがきっかけでした。</p>
<p>自分の声で音楽を作るというアプリは他にもありましたが、他のソフトとの接続が必要だったり、声をうまく拾えなかったりと、曲作りには向いていませんでした。一方、HummingBandの音は平均80%の精度で、2ページ目では音の収差を調整することができるので、100%の完成度で思い描いたメロディを再現することができます。</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>今後の予定</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><b>フェーズ２</b></p>
<p>あるメロディに合うコード進行がある程度決まっているため、ユーザーが歌ったメロディに合わせたコード進行を提供できます。</p>
<p>コード進行を提案してくれるので、初心者の方でも曲作りに一歩近づくことができます。エキスパートはもちろん、自分のオリジナルのコード進行を選択することもできます。</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603327301/jscjq9tavvjotxvobczd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><b>フェーズ３</b></p>
<p>オリジナルのメロディに付随する楽器をAIが演奏します。ユーザーは自分のオリジナルのメロディと歌詞を歌い、楽器とジャンル（ロック、ジャズ、ブルースなど）を選択し、曲をアップビートにするか豊かにするかを選択し、それに合わせてAIが演奏します。</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603327389/tpgt811yhjapo2tzyt23.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>開発の進捗状況</h3>
<p>ハミングバンドのアイデアを思いついたのは大学時代。社会人になってからはアプリ開発の夢は保留になっていましたが、その夢をあきらめずに、新たな進歩を遂げることにしました。現在開発中のアプリは、音の再生精度80％を達成しています。現在はこれを90%まで上げて、第2段階に進んでいます。</p>
<p>バックエンドはC++で開発し、UI/UXはSwift(iPhone)とJava(Android)で開発しながら、アプリのアイコンやデザインも同時に進めています。</p>
<p>今後はテスターへの依頼、デザイン企画、開発、マーケティング、弁護士費用などが必要になります。</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>リスクと課題</h3>
<p>資金を獲得できれば、フェーズ2までの工程を完成させることが出来ます。フェーズ3は理論的には可能ですが、どの程度の品質を実現できるかはまだ未知数です。</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>資金調達の必要性</h3>
<p>HummingBandの開発とマーケティングを支援するため、20,000ドルの資金調達を募集しています。必要な資金の内訳は以下の通りです。</p>
<p>20,000ドル - iPhoneとAndroid用のフェーズ1のデザインと開発を完了させ、さらに3ヶ月間のメンテナンス＆サポート、マーケティング＆プロモーション費用、弁護士費用を加えたものです。</p>
<p><strong>目標延長</strong></p>
<p>30,000ドル - フェーズ2の設計と開発を完了する。</p>
<p>40,000ドル - フェーズ3の設計と開発を完了する。</p>

On the other hand, HummingBand's sound is on average 80% accurate, and the second page allows one to adjust aberrations in sound, meaning you can recreate the melody you imagine with 100% perfection.
 
Future Plans
Phase 2:The app can offer chord progressions that match the melodies sung by the user, as the chord progression that will fit a certain melody is to a certain extent fixed.Offering suggested chord progressions allows beginners to come one step closer to the songwriting experience. Experts will of course be able to choose their own original chord progressions.
Phase 3:AI will perform the instruments accompanying the original melody. The user will sing one's own original melody and lyrics, choose the instruments and genre (rock, jazz, blues, etc.), and whether the song should be upbeat or dark, and the AI will perform accordingly.

 
Development progress
I came up with the idea for HummingBand in college. The dream of developing the app was put on hold when I started working, but, never giving up on that dream, I decided to make new progress. The app is currently under development, and has achieved 80% accuracy in sound reproduction. Currently I am working on raising this level to 90%, and moving on to Phase 2.The backend is being developed with C++, and UI/UX with Swift (iPhone) and Java (Android), while simultaneously working on the icons and designs for the app.From now on, requests to testers, design planning, development, marketing, and legal advisory costs will be necessary.
 

Risks & Challenges
As long as funding is acquired, up until Phase 2 can be released. Phase 3 is theoretically possible, but it's still unknown what level of quality can be achieved.
Funding Needs
We are seeking to raise $20,000 to support the development and marketing of HummingBand. The breakdown of the required funding is as follows:$20,000 - Complete the design and development of Phase 1 for iPhone and Android plus three months of maintenance & support, marketing and promotion costs and legal fees.
Funding Goal Met!
Goal Extension$30,000 - Complete the design and development of Phase 2$40,000 - Complete the design and development of Phase 3
 
アプリの概要
自分だけのオリジナルのメロディを頭の中で考えたことはありませんか？
自分が楽器を演奏している姿を想像したことはありませんか？
HummingBandは、頭の中に思い描いた音楽を実際の音にするアプリです。
HummingBandを使えば、楽器が弾けなくても、音楽理論の知識が全然なくても、自分の創造性をカタチにして、このコロナ渦に自宅で気軽に一人で曲を作れます。自宅にいながらにして、世界を動かすミュージシャンになれる日も近い？！

HummingBandとは？
HummingBandほど正確に人の声を読み取れるアプリは他にはありません。
人の声は、楽器や機械の音に比べて非常に不安定な音ですが、HummingBandは、人の声を正確に読み取れちゃうアプリなんです。
HummingBandは、鼻歌を歌ったり、口笛を吹いたり、歌ったりするだけで、オリジナルのメロディを好きな楽器の音で再現できるアプリです。
人間の声は、楽器や機械の音に比べて非常に不安定な音です。しかし、HummingBandアプリはAIを使った独自のディープラーニングを活用し、原音に80％以上の忠実な音データを生成します。 ピッチ、音量、長さなども忠実に再現されています。
このアプリは、iPhoneとAndroidの両方に対応します。
 
機能のご紹介


Page1:
 

​Page2:
アプリの最初のページでは、80%以上の音を作り出すことができます。しかし、環境(アンビエント)音や外音などのノイズ音を完全に消去するには新たな開発が必要です。(みんなのサポートが必要です)そのため、データはMIDIブロックに変換します。(ここはちょっと技術的な話)
このアプリを使うと、音痴の人でも音程を変えたり、ノイズ音を削除したり、足りない音を追加したりして、イメージ通りの曲を作ることができたりします。

パーソナルストーリー
私は音楽大好少年で、毎週金曜日は友達とガレージや練習スタジオなどで好きなバンドのカバーを練習していました。音楽が大好きで、高校時代は好きなバンドのギターパートを練習に明け暮れる毎日。

ある日、「そろそろ自分たちのオリジナル曲を作ろう」ということになり、ギタリストとして曲作りに挑戦する、という一大決心を実行。
ギターのスキル自体は、コードや複雑なメロディや速弾きを弾くことも出来たのですが、実際に作曲しようとしたところ、頭の中にあるメロディーをギターで弾くことが出来ませんでした。
頭の中ではメロディーは聞こえてはいるものの、仮にギターの弾き方はわかっても、聞こえている音をそのまま弾く、というのがなかなかできません。これに苛立ちを覚え、曲を作ることができなかったんでかなり歯がゆい思いをしたのを覚えてます。
しかし、自分でメロディを歌えることに気づき、ギターやピアノが弾けなくても、鼻歌を歌っているところを拾ってくれるアプリがあれば、自分で曲を作ることができるのではないかと、思ったのがきっかけでした。
自分の声で音楽を作るというアプリは他にもありましたが、他のソフトとの接続が必要だったり、声をうまく拾えなかったりと、曲作りには向いていませんでした。一方、HummingBandの音は平均80%の精度で、2ページ目では音の収差を調整することができるので、100%の完成度で思い描いたメロディを再現することができます。
 
今後の予定
 
フェーズ２
あるメロディに合うコード進行がある程度決まっているため、ユーザーが歌ったメロディに合わせたコード進行を提供できます。
コード進行を提案してくれるので、初心者の方でも曲作りに一歩近づくことができます。エキスパートはもちろん、自分のオリジナルのコード進行を選択することもできます。

フェーズ３
オリジナルのメロディに付随する楽器をAIが演奏します。ユーザーは自分のオリジナルのメロディと歌詞を歌い、楽器とジャンル（ロック、ジャズ、ブルースなど）を選択し、曲をアップビートにするか豊かにするかを選択し、それに合わせてAIが演奏します。

 
開発の進捗状況
ハミングバンドのアイデアを思いついたのは大学時代。社会人になってからはアプリ開発の夢は保留になっていましたが、その夢をあきらめずに、新たな進歩を遂げることにしました。現在開発中のアプリは、音の再生精度80％を達成しています。現在はこれを90%まで上げて、第2段階に進んでいます。
バックエンドはC++で開発し、UI/UXはSwift(iPhone)とJava(Android)で開発しながら、アプリのアイコンやデザインも同時に進めています。
今後はテスターへの依頼、デザイン企画、開発、マーケティング、弁護士費用などが必要になります。
 
リスクと課題
資金を獲得できれば、フェーズ2までの工程を完成させることが出来ます。フェーズ3は理論的には可能ですが、どの程度の品質を実現できるかはまだ未知数です。
 
資金調達の必要性
HummingBandの開発とマーケティングを支援するため、20,000ドルの資金調達を募集しています。必要な資金の内訳は以下の通りです。
20,000ドル - iPhoneとAndroid用のフェーズ1のデザインと開発を完了させ、さらに3ヶ月間のメンテナンス＆サポート、マーケティング＆プロモーション費用、弁護士費用を加えたものです。
目標延長
30,000ドル - フェーズ2の設計と開発を完了する。
40,000ドル - フェーズ3の設計と開発を完了する。

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Since moving to New York four years ago and actively performing at the jazz and gospel scene, <strong>I learned so much about the origins, history, diversity of cultures forming music genres that I love - jazz, gospel, and soul music. </strong>I naturally gravitated to the older, leading African-American generation of jazz &amp; gospel musicians that were the last ones in direct touch and influence with the masters of this music. </p>
<p>By deeply understanding the spiritual meaning of playing jazz &amp; gospel music, I quickly learned that the mission is to pass the messages of our ancestors to the new generation.</p>
<p><strong>Since moving to New York four years ago and performing at the jazz and gospel scene, I learned so much about the origins, history, and diversity of cultures forming music genres that I love - jazz, gospel, and soul music. That's why I dreamt to bring together the best American musicians to arrange and record traditional Slovak folk songs together with jazz, gospel, and r&amp;b classics for my first international album. This will be a unique project delivered through the lenses of an immigrant in the US by uniting people through their musical heritage. I believe that regardless of our cultural background, we all as a human race dream about love, happiness, and peace, and these dreams will be celebrated in my new record called ""Universal Ancestry"".  </strong></p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am very excited about this stellar group of musicians, producers, arrangers, engineers that will help me to record this unique album. Making an album is not only a lot of work but there are many necessary expenses required to create a quality product. Here is what $16,500<strong> </strong>will pay for: </p>
<p><strong>One of the best jazz &amp; gospel musicians</strong></p>
<p><strong>Arrangers  </strong></p>
<p><strong>Co-Producers </strong></p>
<p><strong>Rehearsal Studio </strong></p>
<p><strong>Recording Studio </strong></p>
<p><strong>Engineers </strong></p>
<p><strong>Mixing and Mastering of the record</strong></p>
<p><strong>CD Artwork/Design </strong></p>
<p><strong>CD and Vinyl Production</strong></p>
<p><strong>Songs licensing</strong></p>
<p><strong>Merchandise Manufacturing </strong></p>
<p>As an unsigned independent artist releasing my first international album, I won't be able to cover all these expenses without your help. Please help me to create a very unique and inspiring record. Together we can do this!</p>
<p>If you would be interested in fiscal sponsorship and tax-deductible contribution, please contact me directly at hankasinger@gmail.com</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will support the creation of a unique album, where you will hear the musical fusion of cultures where American jazz, gospel, and r&amp;b artists will do their take on traditional Slovak folk music through modern &amp; exciting arrangements. I will also do my tribute and take on some of my all-time idols and one of the most classic gospel and r&amp;b tunes in new fresh arrangements.</p>
<p>Since I have already successfully released three previous albums, I have all trust that with the team I have put together, this will be an album that will create a different outlook on world-music and fusion of musical genres with one goal - uniting people all over the world in the name of love.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The plan is to start with the song arrangements in December 2020, record in the first quarter of 2021 with the album mix, mastering, and completing it for release in May/June 2021. The studio, arrangers, and musicians have already been booked. Music always has risks and challenges such as meeting recording deadlines especially during these trying times of COVID we live in. However, the professional team I have chosen to work with me on this project will help me to overcome risks and challenges. </p>

<h3>Musicians</h3>
<p><u><strong>Shedrick Mitchell (pianist, arranger, and co-producer of the gospel/soul and r&amp;b part of the album)</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Shedrick will be accompanied by the greatest musicians on the gospel &amp; r&amp;b scene for the gospel/soul and r&amp;b part of Hanka's record</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605319432/oqzgpbsp2u3dshutxdis.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Twenty-five years.  Multiple genres.  Iconic superstars.  Four-time Grammy awards winner. </strong> It’s safe to say Shedrick Mitchell has accomplished his dreams, and then some.   Starting in a church in St. Louis where his grandfather, and later his father, was the Pastor his first experience playing the piano proved to be exactly what was needed.</p>
<p>Moving to New York City presented new opportunities to study with famed pianists, <strong>Mulgrew Miller and John Hicks</strong> who encouraged Shedrick to attend The New School (Mannes School of Music).  He thrived on the abundance of musicians who played at the highest level:  Kenny Kirkland, Oscar Peterson, Harrold Mabern, and countless others.  New York City was a breeding ground of musical genius expressed through jazz music.</p>
<p>After the untimely passing of Kenny Kirkland, it was Mulgrew Miller who recommended Shedrick for Kenny Garrett’s band.  Touring internationally for the first time gave him a broader perspective of jazz music and eventually led to him recording on <strong>Kenny Garrett’s album</strong>, “Simply Said”.</p>
<p>Following his work with Kenny Garrett, Shedrick went on to work with many jazz greats including <strong>Dee Dee Bridgewater, Christian McBride, Terrance Blanchard, Antonio Hart, Johnny Griffin, Dianne Reeves, </strong>and others.  But, it was in 2003 that <strong>Shedrick was asked to accompany one of the greatest voices of our time, Whitney Houston.  Shedrick toured with Ms. Houston for nine years </strong>on many different platforms including major television award shows, The Oprah Winfrey Show, and even royal audiences in many countries.  What may be equally impressive is that he continued to perform and record jazz music and play at his local church in between tours.</p>
<p>Opportunities continued to pour in.  Several years later, Shedrick collaborated with the legendary <strong>Stevie Wonder</strong>, music and business mogul <strong>Jay-Z, and R&amp;B/soul star, Maxwell. </strong> During these years, many career highlights included the Super Bowl XL halftime show with Stevie Wonder, the American Gangster soundtrack, and VH-1 special, ‘Storytellers’ with Jay-Z and co-producing Maxwell’s recordings, “Black” and “Summers,” while currently serving as his Music Director. </p>
<p>Considering all of these invaluable experiences, receiving the request to accompany “The Queen” Ms. <strong>Aretha Franklin</strong>, was nothing short of extraordinary.  For two years, Shedrick graced the stage with Ms. Franklin.  Their performances included an appearance on Late Show with David Letterman performing songs from her last recording, “Aretha Sings the Great Diva Classics,” and one of the highest honors, <strong>performing at the White House for President Barack Obama.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Both Whitney Houston and Aretha Franklin had a special affinity for Shedrick’s musicianship.  When he accompanied them on piano or organ, they enjoyed the freedom his playing allowed, returning them to their gospel roots.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Twenty-five years later, having received four Grammy Awards and recorded over 200 records encompassing styles as diverse as classical, new age, rock, jazz, country, gospel, R&amp;B/soul, and reggae, the journey continues.</strong>  In June 2020, Shedrick will release his second solo recording, “Time – Reflections – Distance”, which he hopes will speak to the challenges we all face today.</p>
<p><u><strong>Anthony Wonsey (pianist, arranger &amp; co-producer of the folk/world-music/jazz part of the album)</strong></u></p>
<p><strong>Anthony will be accompanied by the greatest jazz musicians on the NY scene for the folk/world-music/jazz part of the album)</strong></p>

<p>Wonsey had piano lessons from his mother, a classically trained pianist; he later studied at <strong>Berklee College of Music</strong>, where he graduated in 1994. He then moved to Boston and worked there a. a. with <strong>Roy Hargrove and Antonio Hart.</strong> He later played in the bands of <strong>Carl Allen, Vincent Herring, Curtis Lundy, Buster Williams, Clark Terry, Elvin Jones, and Nicholas Payton; </strong>he also worked with his own formations. In 1995 he made his first album under his own name, Anthonyology, with <strong>Carl Allen and Christian McBride</strong>, followed by Another Perspective on the Evidence label. In 1998, with Nicholas Payton and Ron Blake, the album Open the Gates for the Criss Cross-Label was created with an expanded line-up. In the early 2000s, Wonsey then switched to the Sharp Nine label; with Eric Alexander and Nat Reeves, he played the album The Thang (Highnote, 2005). Together with jazz singer Joanna Pascale, he released the album Play the Great American Songbook on Stiletto Records in 2010.<br/><strong>Wonsey is part of Vincent Herrings Earth Jazz Agents. Anthony is also a stable member of the Hanka G NYC Quartet. </strong>He has also worked with Carmen Lundy, Russell Malone, Wynton Marsalis, Jim Rotondi, Adonis Rose, and Scott Wendholt. Currently (2019) he belongs to Dave Schumacher's formation Chicago 3 +2.</p>
<p><strong>Hanka will be accompanied by also one of the greatest Slovak jazz and traditional folk musicians.</strong></p>

Moving to New York City presented new opportunities to study with famed pianists, Mulgrew Miller and John Hicks who encouraged Shedrick to attend The New School (Mannes School of Music).  He thrived on the abundance of musicians who played at the highest level:  Kenny Kirkland, Oscar Peterson, Harrold Mabern, and countless others.  New York City was a breeding ground of musical genius expressed through jazz music.
After the untimely passing of Kenny Kirkland, it was Mulgrew Miller who recommended Shedrick for Kenny Garrett’s band.  Touring internationally for the first time gave him a broader perspective of jazz music and eventually led to him recording on Kenny Garrett’s album, “Simply Said”.
Following his work with Kenny Garrett, Shedrick went on to work with many jazz greats including Dee Dee Bridgewater, Christian McBride, Terrance Blanchard, Antonio Hart, Johnny Griffin, Dianne Reeves, and others.  But, it was in 2003 that Shedrick was asked to accompany one of the greatest voices of our time, Whitney Houston.  Shedrick toured with Ms. Houston for nine years on many different platforms including major television award shows, The Oprah Winfrey Show, and even royal audiences in many countries.  What may be equally impressive is that he continued to perform and record jazz music and play at his local church in between tours.
Opportunities continued to pour in.  Several years later, Shedrick collaborated with the legendary Stevie Wonder, music and business mogul Jay-Z, and R&B/soul star, Maxwell.  During these years, many career highlights included the Super Bowl XL halftime show with Stevie Wonder, the American Gangster soundtrack, and VH-1 special, ‘Storytellers’ with Jay-Z and co-producing Maxwell’s recordings, “Black” and “Summers,” while currently serving as his Music Director. 
Considering all of these invaluable experiences, receiving the request to accompany “The Queen” Ms. Aretha Franklin, was nothing short of extraordinary.  For two years, Shedrick graced the stage with Ms. Franklin.  Their performances included an appearance on Late Show with David Letterman performing songs from her last recording, “Aretha Sings the Great Diva Classics,” and one of the highest honors, performing at the White House for President Barack Obama.
Both Whitney Houston and Aretha Franklin had a special affinity for Shedrick’s musicianship.  When he accompanied them on piano or organ, they enjoyed the freedom his playing allowed, returning them to their gospel roots.
Twenty-five years later, having received four Grammy Awards and recorded over 200 records encompassing styles as diverse as classical, new age, rock, jazz, country, gospel, R&B/soul, and reggae, the journey continues.  In June 2020, Shedrick will release his second solo recording, “Time – Reflections – Distance”, which he hopes will speak to the challenges we all face today.
Anthony Wonsey (pianist, arranger & co-producer of the folk/world-music/jazz part of the album)
Anthony will be accompanied by the greatest jazz musicians on the NY scene for the folk/world-music/jazz part of the album)

Wonsey had piano lessons from his mother, a classically trained pianist; he later studied at Berklee College of Music, where he graduated in 1994. He then moved to Boston and worked there a. a. with Roy Hargrove and Antonio Hart. He later played in the bands of Carl Allen, Vincent Herring, Curtis Lundy, Buster Williams, Clark Terry, Elvin Jones, and Nicholas Payton; he also worked with his own formations. In 1995 he made his first album under his own name, Anthonyology, with Carl Allen and Christian McBride, followed by Another Perspective on the Evidence label. In 1998, with Nicholas Payton and Ron Blake, the album Open the Gates for the Criss Cross-Label was created with an expanded line-up. In the early 2000s, Wonsey then switched to the Sharp Nine label; with Eric Alexander and Nat Reeves, he played the album The Thang (Highnote, 2005). Together with jazz singer Joanna Pascale, he released the album Play the Great American Songbook on Stiletto Records in 2010.Wonsey is part of Vincent Herrings Earth Jazz Agents. Anthony is also a stable member of the Hanka G NYC Quartet. He has also worked with Carmen Lundy, Russell Malone, Wynton Marsalis, Jim Rotondi, Adonis Rose, and Scott Wendholt. Currently (2019) he belongs to Dave Schumacher's formation Chicago 3 +2.
Hanka will be accompanied by also one of the greatest Slovak jazz and traditional folk musicians.

It became a HUGE challenge after the outbreak of the COVID: </strong></p><p>Astor Piazzolla has been part of my artistic life from the beginning of my music career. I started singing and performing his music in NYC with some of the most outstanding Argentine musicians of our time, winners of many Latin Grammies today, such as Fernando Otero, Octavio Brunetti, Pedro Giraudo, Emilio Solla, and many more.  While in NYC, I produced and released my first CD <a href=""http://open.spotify.com/album/1OlkKxsXN5jW5nkUiWslTs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ballads for my Life and Death</a>: Tribute to Piazzolla, presented at the  Blue Notes of NYC and MIlán.  Later on, when returned to my country Argentina, I began a musical collaboration with a young pianist and composer, also a Latin Grammy nominee,  Miguel Pereiro. As passionate admirers of Piazzolla´s music,  we created several musical shows around his music, such as Piantados and Piazzolla íntimo. Our collaboration led to the production and release of my second CD  <a href=""http://open.spotify.com/album/02WMLM6GeMMPdlLiCWHHIK"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Renacere: Piazzolla x Cangiano </a>(EPSA music, 2017.) Many well known Argentina musicians were part of this project, among them Piazzolla´s nephew, Pipi Piazzolla, Julián Vat, the musical director of The Astor Piazzolla´s Quintet,  Quique Sinesi, an incredible guitarist and composer, Bernardo Monk, the saxophone player, and composer and many more.  Renaceré was released in many prestigious  Buenos Aires venues and brought to Japan in 2019. </p><p><strong>MY DREAM </strong></p><p>My dream to continue performing worldwide this incredible music in 2020 was interrupted by the  Covid.  All my artistic commitments were postponed to 2021, among them,  invitations to perform in some incredible World music festivals in Japan and China.  As you might imagine artists have been badly affected by these unexpected circumstances.  Our performances, that are our most important mean of subsistence have been suddenly interrupted.  <strong>In spite of the challenges, my dream to release a new musical project to appreciate the artistry of Astor Piazzolla remained alive.

I am a Buddhist and believe that our own darkness is a door to our light. Astor Piazzolla´s music addresses a myriad of emotional tendencies - sadness, nostalgia- some of them typical of tango music, but at the same time, it talks about hope, love, and the possibility to construct a better world...so let's give music a chance to reach everybody´s heart with a message for a better world!</p><p><strong>LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST </strong></p><p>We are offering a variety of perks so everybody can make at least a small contribution.

While I rustled through all of the moments and melodies,  I decided on ten songs to bring to life and send them off into this wicked world. With the help of some amazing collaborators and musicians, we are creating a record of high caliber and a true expression of the journey I have been on as an artist and human. </p>
<p>To continue the work, I am inviting you to take part in the making of this album. I would be nowhere if it weren't for my amazing friends, family, and fans. I consider myself so extremely lucky - with your love and support I have  been able to follow my own path and live a life of purpose and creativity. Thank you. </p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I am a music creator because I believe it to be an important way to communicate and connect with people. I believe that songwriting is about documenting the human experience, and relating that into a universal message that people can connect to and find joy, comfort, and hope. It is soul food that fulfills each of us in a unique way. I want to quote one of my favourite artists who has so eloquently expressed something that I could not say any better. </p>
<p><i>""You can’t separate human beings from music. It’s always been with us. We’ve always made it. It reflects our intention. It’s completely a mirror of the human soul. It has infinite value. Whether people are paying for records or not, I still know very deeply that it has meaning, and is worth devoting my life to.""</i> - Shara Worden (My Brightest Diamond.com)</p>
<p>I believe that music can express the stuff we are all made of. It has the power to inspire, motivate, change, and comfort us. The impact of creating songs that reach people is immeasurable. </p>

<li>2015 and 2018 Contemporary singer/songwriter Jack Richardson Award</li>

<li>Featured London artist at Canadian Music Week </li>

<li>Shortlisted for EP of the year at CHRW radio London</li>
</ul>
<p>The road to success is filled with twists and turns, especially in a constantly changing ever evolving industry. Especially in 2020.</p>
<p>My goal for this release is to build on the success I have already achieved, and continue to reach new audiences in Canada and beyond. When the word opens up, I will be thrilled to share these songs-our songs- on stages across North America and Europe. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand completely that sometimes it is just not in our power to support an artist financially. I think we all have been in times of struggle, especially this year! The good news is that there are so many ways you can support music and make an impact on an artist's career.</p>

Hello friends and supporters of Independent music! 
My name is Carly Thomas.
Over the past year I have been piecing together my next release, and now I am welcoming you to be a part of its creation. This is a collection of songs I've been carrying with me for the past few years, quietly waiting for their time to shine . While I rustled through all of the moments and melodies,  I decided on ten songs to bring to life and send them off into this wicked world. With the help of some amazing collaborators and musicians, we are creating a record of high caliber and a true expression of the journey I have been on as an artist and human. 
To continue the work, I am inviting you to take part in the making of this album. I would be nowhere if it weren't for my amazing friends, family, and fans. I consider myself so extremely lucky - with your love and support I have  been able to follow my own path and live a life of purpose and creativity. Thank you. 
When you support this project, you are directly contributing to my musical vision without compromise. You are directly contributing to the livelihood of musicians and friends of mine in an industry that has faced some major challenges this year. You are directly contributing to me as an artist, an artist who is building a career that is deeply rooted in creative integrity.
I want to inspire and be inspired by the world around me, and continue to grow personally and professionally while doing and sharing what I am passionate about.  You are a true patron of the arts and in a time when it is needed the most,  Thank You.  
What exactly you are supporting: 

Pre-production sessions
Hiring of independent session players: guitar, drums, piano, strings, bass, and more. 
Studio costs 
Producer/Engineer costs
Mixing and Mastering 
Artwork and design
Marketing and PR 

 
I am asking you to be a part of this with me, and in return I've got some great rewards and unique perks that will only be available for this fundraising campaign. I can't wait to share what I have been working on! 
 

What We Need & What You Get

The cost of the entire project (including marketing) is close to $10,000 CAD, I'm hoping to cover the costs associated with the production and release of a full length album.
As perks we have personalized songs, house concerts, Front Row VIP club status, tickets to the virtual listening party, limited merchandise, and more! 
All levels of support will get the digital album before it is officially released.

<p>Parker Wonser is an aspiring DJ from Grand Rapids, Michigan, who has a passion for music and design. Working with music gives him life. He recently released a self-produced, hour-long, Christmas themed mix that successfully sold 150 copies for $15 each. This helped pay off his student debt and taught him a lot about the world of DJing. After receiving overwhelmingly positive reviews, Parker felt inspired to begin his second mix.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>His new project is a one hour, music-only mix titled “Virtual Valentine” that showcases 50 different love songs from the past five decades. These tracks are perfect for elevating your Valentine’s Day experience or any other romantic occasion.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Parker’s goal on Indiegogo is to raise $1,000 to cover the cost of the 60+ hours it took to create the mix and fuel his DJ journey. If you donate any amount, you will receive a link to stream “Virtual Valentine” on any device, starting February 14th. Parker is working towards DJing live events, and by backing this project, you are helping him get one step closer to his dream. The money from this will help Parker purchase more softwares and equipment necessary to move forward with DJing.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Ben. I rap under the name A Dinosaur. I am the rapper from I Wish I Were A Dinosaur and Former Fat Boys. <strong>I Wish I Were A Dinosaur</strong> is my side project and the <strong>Former Fat Boys </strong>has been around for awhile with 5 full length albums. Throughout my rap career I've had incredible adventures playing shows and doing songs with great nerdcore emcees like mc chris, MC Lars, MC Frontalot, Beefy, Mega Ran aka Random, YTCracker, and Richie Branson.</p>
<p>I used to write Star Wars fan fiction before rapping about Star Wars. I passionately believe in the vision that George Lucas brought to life on the big screen. There's one issue that is paramount to all Star Wars fans and I thought it needed to be addressed with a song. That issue regards Han Solo and whether he shot first. George Lucas says he didn't, everyone else says he did.</p>
<p>I wrote the song, teamed up with a new rapper named JediWap and played an early cut for <strong>MC Lars</strong>. He was impressed, but thought he could put forth a better argument. He dared me to let him drop a verse. I tried to be polite and told him I already had a rapper (JediWap) helping with the project.</p>
<p>And so a <i>nerdcore civil war</i> broke out. Friends and colleagues at each other's throats over a Star Wars song! MC Lars recorded his version and some bothans died bringing it to me. I was persuaded to accept his challenge and so we have a <i>Special Edition</i> version of the song and video.</p>
<p>This May, before the new Han Solo movie comes out, there will be two songs and music videos that will forever put to rest any questions anyone still had about Han shooting first. And we'll be settling one argument, but starting another. <strong>Which Han Shot First themed music video is better: the original or the Special Edition?</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your help to get this message out across the known galaxy. The song is finished and the music video is almost done. Things left to accomplish include mastering, color correction, and PR. Having pros do those parts will help a bunch.</p>
<p>What you get? Part of the reason I wanted to offer this campaign wasn't just for the money, but it was to give away some once in a lifetime things like: props from the music video, posters, album covers, autographs, costumes from the video, hats, guest verses, and the opportunity to appear in (soon to be) the greatest Star Wars music video of all time. There are other rewards like the song, the new Former Fat Boys album before the general public gets it, and some other surprises.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Obviously we'd like to break the internet or, at least, <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/starwars"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">/r/StarWars</a> or <a href=""www.reddit.com/r/PrequelMemes"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">/r/PrequelMemes</a> <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/SaltierThanCrait"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">/r/SaltierThanCrait</a>. However, we're really hoping to get the attention of the powers that be and help push them to settle this injustice once and for all.</p>
<p><i><strong>Yeah, but have you and MC Lars ever done anything cool before?</strong></i></p>
<p>Good question, Aguado. I think we have.</p>
<p>Our song and music for Revenge of the Nerds with Beefy and YTCracker raised money for a great charity called The Trevor Project.</p>

<p>MC Lars and Brian Mazzaferri from I Fight Dragons had a Star Wars song that I produced the music video for a few years ago. I think it turned out pretty well and not just because the video is so good.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I take my sweet ass time and don't finish the video in time. That's very unlikely though as I watched it last night and it's 90% there. Which is why I'm starting the campaign now: I'm sure it will be finished.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Be a champion of the Force. Also, us. Share this campaign everywhere you can. Tell your friends. When this video comes out we need your help to get it everywhere you can. The whole point of this campaign and song is to get our message out the the world and make a change.</p>

<ul>
<li>recording</li>
<li>mastering</li>
<li>CD manufacturing and shipping them to you!!!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are always risks and challenges that come with making an album. The main ones having to do with running out of time and funding...</p>
<p>First off, let's be real: if we do not achieve our goal, the funding gathered from this campaign will go towards our next project!!! No efforts will be in vain!!! <strong>You will still get all your perks and we will keep fighting until our dreams are reality!!!</strong></p>
<p>I have recorded projects with other artists in the past, and often the biggest problem was time!</p>
<p>Experience has taught me to plan an be cautious... So here is our plan on tackling the time challenge:</p>
<ul><li>We begin recording individual tracks as soon as we have reached our funding goal!!!</li></ul>
<p>This way we spend 1 month of the year on each track, and by the end of 2019 we will have a complete album!!!</p>
<p>So the work commences immediately after the success of our campaign!!! We don't have a minute to waste!!!</p>
<p>Sometimes the CD is not printed well or does not come out to the quality you expect.</p>
<ul><li>To avoid these issues all the CDs for contributors ~ you ~ will be printed locally and then shipped manually by me!!! Only trough this campaign!!! All other CDs will be shipped by my printing company. So hurry and get yours directly from me!!!</li></ul>
<p>Though we plan to ship all perks out immediately after the closing of the campaign, please keep in mind that it might take us time to get to your order, between two weeks to two months. <strong>The time of fulfillment and delivery will vary with three factors:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Your Location. </strong>We ship worldwide, however some countries take longer to process parcels than others. Also some countries will require you to pick up your parcel at the postal office, with a piece of ID! This happened with one of my fans in Lithuania. She did not get her item delivered to her door, and instead she picked it up at the local post office. Mind, that you can keep track of this information and where your parcel is with the tracking number I send you. And if there are issues with your parcels and you can not find it ~ again you can freely write to me: viraburmenko@gmail.com. I will track your parcel for you and find all details and your parcel location.</li>
<li>
<strong>The size of your perk!!!</strong> I print my products with two companies: Printful for mugs, t-shirts and hoodies; and PrestoPhoto for Photo Books, Metal Art, Calendars and posters. If your perk is a large order, expect it to arrive in two batches: one part from Printful and another from Prestophoto. The delivery times will vary.</li>
<li>
<strong>The type of an item you ordered with your perk.</strong> Please note that mugs, T-shirts, and Hoodies may take longer to fulfill than Photo Books and Art Work. (See 2.)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>*Note: all products will be shipped to you immediately, except for the CD ~ you will receive your CDs and Digital Downloads in December 2019, as a holiday present!!! :)</strong></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary

Who we are:
I am Vira Burmenko, an award winning, gypsy~punk, dancing violinist and a composer. (MA, BFA Music York University) aka ~ The Warrior Queen!!! I have performed for over 15 years and my music is featured in multiple short films, the award~winning web series Marked, and on Netflix!!! My string band, Iron Fiddle, have been entertaining the crowds around GTA for over a decade!!! Though we love to fulfill requests, the time has come for us to release the music we love to make, regardless of mainstream demands!!! We are warriors from East and West and we bring to you our epic gypsy metal saga as we tell our story!!! Join us and become a warrior too!!!

What this project means to us:
Inspired by G. R. R. Martin's ""The Song of Ice and Fire"", and music by Yngwie Malmsteen, this album is my life's dream come true!!! Bringing it into reality is life-changing for us as independent artists! It is time for unique genres, like gypsy~metal, to be heard and recognized among its fans!!! We fight to make the music we love, to tell our story and to do it our way!!! Once the campaign is successful we will deliver 12 tracks of epic warrior saga featuring Eastern~European Gypsy style merged with Scandinavian Metal!!! Would you like to hear it??? CLICK HERE TO GET OUR FREE SONG!!! Are you with us???

What you help us achieve: With your help we will create an album that will blow you away, inspire and empower you and other artists like us, who dare to take a chance and make the music they love, despite criticism. Together, and by example, we will be giving permission to independent artists around the world to pursue their true calling and be unafraid to stand out, come out of the shadows and into the light!!! The physical CDs and digital downloads will drop into your hearts in 2019~2020 holiday season!!! Once we complete the album we will then perform it and later tour!!!
This is only the first step in a succession of great things for our music!!! Help us make it a reality so you and your warrior friends can not only hear us, but also one day see us live in the city near you!!! Shine your warrior spirit!!!
 


What We Need & What You Get
We ask for 5,000 CAD only!!! This amount will help us cover the costs of:

recording
mastering
CD manufacturing and shipping them to you!!!

Did you know that a normal rate for fully producing one track is 2,000 CAD??? This is how much I already invested into creating the first song for you!!! And I am gifting it to you!!!
 
This means that at a normal rate, the 10-track album would cost us $20,000 to produce!!!
We do not get paid for doing the work!!! We only want your help producing it so we can deliver the physical CD into your hands and our music into your hearts!!!
And because I am working with an amazing engineer who is volunteering half of his time, we can afford to do the album on only 5,000 CAD. Because the people we work with are also passionate about the project like we are!!! (Their identities will soon be revealed.)
We pour our hearts and sweat into it!!! But we still need to cover these basic costs listed above!!! Are you with us??? Let's make the album!!!

We have the most fantastic perks for you with goodies ranging far and wide:

Warrior Mugs
Warrior Tees
Warrior Hoodies
Photo Books
Nude Art featuring the Warrior Queen

<p>I've been singing and writing poetry and songs for most of my life.  It has been an unwaning passion for as long as I can remember.  I've been really lucky to have had some great musical experiences, performing live at the best and biggest venues in San Francisco California as well as Las Vegas, and I've had many wonderful studio experiences.  I've been trained by one of the best Vocal Coaches around (Raz Kennedy), and have studied Voice at the Berkeley Jazz School in Berkeley California.   Music is something that I simply have to do, to make, to enjoy, and to share.  There's so much inside me that's ready to come out via our songs.</p>
<p>The guys that make up the rest of ""Shades"" are an awesome group that i stumbled upon whilst jamming here in Cuenca, Ecuador.  From the first time that we jammed together, everything just felt so easy.  The music just bubbled up from some unknown place in such a beautiful way, we knew from the first jam that we all wanted to make more music together.  Klever Santacruz from Cuenca on Guitar is an incredible guitarist, and a jolly ham.  Luis Chiriboga, who's getting his degrees in Music, plays keyboards beautifully, and brings an earnest presence to our work.  Freyler Lopez from Venezuela is a genius on the bass, I smile like a cheshire cat when he plays, he's fantastic.  And Pedro Ortiz is an awesome drummer, also from Cuenca.  Their musicality is incredible, and what a bunch of characters I've found!</p>
<p>We have 8 Wonderful Songs, a mix of soul, pop, reggae, funk, and ambient electronica.  The songs are about love, self-empowerment / discovery, sprituality and politics.  We have a burning desire to make our first full length original album with these songs, and one professional music video to accompany our first release.   We  can't do it alone, so are inviting you to take a part in helping this Album and Video to be made.  </p>
<p>We're aiming to raise $7,500.00  This will cover the remaining recording.  It'll pay for the pro mixing and mastering of the album by Bill Williams, an incredible producer from California, U.S.A, I've worked with him before and he's up there with the best.  It'll pay for the printing of cd's and guest musicians; we'll be inviting a few awesomely talented musicians to record on some of the songs, a little Sax here, a little accoustic drum / percussion there, it's going to be mad cool!  And  it'll pay for one pro-music video recorded and produced for our first release.  This will be my first music video, to say I am excited is an understatement.  Some of the funds will also help to pay for childcare so that I can work on this project.  I'm a blessed Mom with 3 beautiful kids.  As any parent knows, working with kids in tow is extremely challenging.   I do as much myself as humanly possible.  I designed our website, this campaign.  I do most of the social media promo.  And I'm very proud to show here my first video creation.  Inspired and helped by good friend George Gliszczynski, the video presentation you see on this campaign was completely edited by me.   But I just can't do it all.  I need  help to make this dream happen, and to share our sonic contributions with this world.  I need some help with my beautiful almost 2 year old so that i can record and work on this project inbetween my time with her that i'm so incredibly thankful for.  She's one of my biggest inspirations and one of the songs on this Album was written about her....  We're COMPLETELY honest and transparent, feel free to ask any questions.   We came to $7,500 based on real quotes from the music producer, a videographer, and estimations for the remaining recording, as well as childcare and the cds.  We'll keep a log of expenses and will make it available to all contributing angels that would like to see it.   </p>
<p>The perks we've lined up for our contributing angels are awesome.  We have really cool merchandice, signed cd's, private performances, song dedications and even the chance to have a song written for you, but there's much, much more, see the list for all of the awesome packages.</p>
<p>If we fall short of our goal, we'll use whatever money is raised to forge ahead and record song by song, as money allows.   In this instance we'd organize another smaller campaign later to cover the short fall.   We're determined to make this creation a reality, we're ready to finish recording as soon as we have the backing of our incredible music loving community.   Thank you thank you for supporting us, and the arts.  I sincerely believe that Art and Music enriches the lives of anyone that's open to it.  In this vein, I believe our music will move and inspire people.  By contributing to the making of this album you'd be making us, and everyone that loves the music, literally happier because of it.  Thank you.</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>I have been playing saxophone for about fourteen years and have been writing music for about six years. I grew up in Eau Claire, Wisconsin and got my Bachelor of Music degree in saxophone performance from the University of Wisconsin Eau Claire. About three years ago I moved to Cincinnati, OH to pursue a Master of Music degree in jazz studies from the Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music. Since graduating a year ago I have been freelancing in the Cincinnati area. </p>
<p>For the past few years I have been trying to decide when would be the right time to record. I decided that now is the time. I finally feel like I am ready to share my compositions and saxophone playing with the world.

The title of the CD comes from the text of a short canon written by Beethoven as a pun on Kuhlau's name. An unconventional and decidedly curious phrase!,- for us it has become a endearing symbol of the connection between two great composers.</p><p><strong>Hopefully, the CD will be ready for release by December, 2019.

The experience had been a very enriching one, and the wish to continue the same in-depth work in the repertoire for flute and fortepiano was born. We immediately began 'cooking' the idea with intensive rehearsals, reading through the repertoire, and brainstorming over many mugs of coffee and tea. It quickly became clear that there was an interesting chemistry in the music of Beethoven and Kuhlau, and we were determined to dive in ""for the record""!</p><p><strong>We've already laid down the tracks</strong> in a three-day session this past February at the Westvest90 church in Schiedam (NL), a venue known for its intimate chamber-music acoustics. There, we put our performance in the capable hands of sound engineer Rainer Arndt, a specialist in recording historical instruments and founder of the Belgian recording label <a href=""http://www.ramee.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ramée</a>.</p><p><strong>It's a strong start, and now we really need your help to give this project a push so that we can bring the CD to completion.</strong></p><div>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559813850/dtl3pxfipfa7litjb6qw.jpg"" src=""""/><p> </p>
<p><strong>Our recording is anchored by two pillars of the 19th century repertoire for flute and fortepiano:</strong> the <i>Serenade</i> of Beethoven, published in 1803 as his opus 41, bends the boundaries of Classicism with impulsive dynamic changes and measured attention to timing, while the <i>Grande Sonate Concertante</i> of Kuhlau (opus 85) reaches eagerly for a more Romantic aesthetic, inviting an expressive freedom in his virtuosic writing and rich harmonic textures. These tendencies are also reflected in his works for solo flute, here represented by the<i> Capriccio in D minor</i>, op. 10.</p>
<p><strong>The inspiration to juxtapose the music of Beethoven and Kuhlau comes from the delightful account of their only meeting, which took place at a festive gathering in 1825.</strong> After a relaxing walk in the great outdoors, Kuhlau challenged his colleagues with a musical puzzle based on the tones B-A-C-H (B-flat/A/C/B-natural). Beethoven, tipsy from the champagne, apparently improvised a three-voiced canon on the spot but thought better of his attempt the following morning. He sent Kuhlau a note with a canon on the same theme, but with the added text <i>‘kühl, nicht lau‘ </i>(cold, not lukewarm), a friendly pun on Kuhlau's name. This charming moment became the obvious title of our recording, and is honoured by a short <strong>'Kühl-canon'</strong> on the CD: arranged by Joris Weimar and performed by flute, piano, and a trio of male voices (our illustrious colleagues João Moreira, Mattijs van de Woerd, and Marc Pantus), it brings the listener closer to a time when extemporization and musical riddles were a regular part of musicians’ lives. </p>

<p><strong>For this recording, Tami is playing a German eight-keyed wooden Flute from the beginning of the 19th century, and Shuann is playing on two different Fortepianos: a 5,5 octave piano built around 1800 by Johann Zahler of Brno,  and a 6-octave Viennese piano by Michael Rosenberger (ca. 1820), </strong>generously loaned by the <a href=""http://www.muziekinstrumentenfonds.nl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Nationaal Muziekinstrumentenfonds</a>.<strong> </strong>Ingeniously hand-crafted and rich in tonal variety, instruments such as these were the ones that composers like Beethoven and Kuhlau knew, and for which their pieces were written. We love that the specific timbre of these instruments provides us with the chance to enter a composer's sound world.</p>

<p><strong>Enthusiasm and passion have given us the drive to get this far, but the reality is that there are many financial considerations to a recording project and they add up quickly. For example: </strong></p>

<p><strong>Wie zijn wij en wat doen wij?</strong></p>
<p>Wij zijn <a href=""http://www.tamikrausz.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tami Krausz</a> en <a href=""http://www.shuannchai.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Shuann Chai</a>: een kamer-muziek-duo uit Den Haag. Afgelopen 20 jaar hebben wij ons beiden met veel internationale optredens toegelegd op het brede repertoire van de 18e-20e eeuw, op historische instrumenten. Het is ons een groot genoegen om onze CD aan te kondigen met werken voor fluit en piano van Beethoven en Kuhlau. De CD is in februari 2019 opgenomen in de Westvest Kerk in Schiedam, die beroemd is om haar prachtige akoestiek voor kamermuziek. Ons optreden was in de ervaren handen en oren van geluidstechnicus Rainer Arndt, eigenaar en oprichter van de Belgische platenmaatschappij <a href=""http://www.ramee.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ramée</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Wat heeft ons geïnspireerd om dit te doen?</strong></p>
<p>Het idee kwam op in de trein: Tami was op weg terug vanuit een opname in het Louvre in Parijs, een verrijkende ervaring. De ambitie naar verdere verdieping in kamermuziek voor piano en fluit was geboren! Terwijl Shuann repeteerde voor een recital programma met een aantal optredens in Nederland realiseerdenzij zich dat de tijd rijp was om deze duo stukken op te nemen.</p>
<p>Als uitvoerende musici blijft een live concert onze grootste inspiratie. Het maken van een opname geeft ons de mogelijkheid om een extra uitdaging aan te gaan. De voorbereiding en concentratie die bij een opname komen kijken zijn daar de belangrijkste elementen van. Hoe dan ook blijft het doel voor ons hetzelfde: het verhaal van een componist vertellen.</p>
<p>Voor onze luisteraars proberen we deze twee magische werelden te combineren: de intieme ervaring van een concertzaal op onze CD en de precisie van een opnamesessie bij onze live-optredens.</p>
<p><strong>“Kühl Nicht Lau” ?</strong></p>
<p>Een charmant moment in de muzikale geschiedenis heeft ons tot deze titel gebracht:</p>
<p>De enige keer dat Kuhlau en Beethoven elkaar ontmoetten! Het was 1825. Na een ontspannen avondwandeling in Baden, met nog drie andere musici, daagde Kuhlau zijn collega's uit met een muzikaal puzzeltje gebaseerd op de naam van Bach (bes/a/c/b). Beethoven improviseerde ter plekke een driestemmige canon. De ochtend erna stuurde hij Kuhlau een brief met een betere versie van zijn canon.

<p><strong>Iets over onze instrumenten:</strong></p>
<p>In deze periode werd er gespeeld op allerlei soorten meer-kleppenfluiten en fortepiano's. Er werden veel nieuwe instrumenten en bouwtechnieken ontwikkeld. Componisten zochten grenzen en variëteit van expressie, klank en timbre. Dat was immers de tijdsgeest in deze overgangsperiode van Klassieke muziek naar Romantische muziek. Ook te zien in drama, literatuur en politiek.</p>
<p>Tami speelt op een 8-kleppige houten Duitse traverso, Shuann speelt op twee verschillende fortepiano's: Een Zahler piano (5,5-octaavs, 1800) en een Rosenberger (6-octaavs, 1820), met dank aan de <a href=""http://www.muziekinstrumentenfonds.nl"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">National Muziekinstrumentenfonds</a>.</p>

<p>Nous - Tami et Shuann - avons le plaisir de vous présenter notre nouveau CD, un enregistrement qui met à l’honneur la musique du 19ème siècle exécutée sur instruments d’époque. Le programme comporte notamment entre autres « joyaux », la <i>Sérénade</i> de Beethoven (Op. 41) ainsi que la <i>Grande Sonate Concertante</i> en La mineur de Kuhlau (Op. 85). Le titre du disque, 'KÜHL, NICHT LAU', est un jeu de mot de la main de Beethoven sur le nom de son contemporain Friedrich Kuhlau. Il apparaît sur un court canon et nous semblait donc tout indiqué pour former un trait d’union musical entre ces deux compositeurs.</p>

<p><strong>Nous avons sélectionné un répertoire du 19ème siècle pour flûte et pianoforte, à la croisée des chemins esthétiques classique et romantique.</strong> L’idée de juxtaposer la musique de Beethoven à celle de Kuhlau est née de la lecture du récit de leur unique rencontre, en septembre 1825 à Baden. Lors de cet évènement qui rassemblait de nombreux musiciens, Kuhlau mit au défi les autres participants de composer une courte pièce suivant la progression B-A-C-H (si bémol / la / do / si). Piqué au jeu et certainement aidé par la tradition viticole de la région, il semble que Beethoven improvisa alors un canon à trois voix. Se repenchant sur sa composition le lendemain, il lui sembla opportun d’y apporter quelques modifications et fit parvenir à Kuhlau une note comportant un canon similaire mais auquel le texte « kühl, nicht lau » (froid, pas tiède) fut rajouté, un clin d’œil au patronyme de Friedrich Kuhlau. Le titre de notre programme était dès lors tout trouvé! Et pour pousser l’hommage encore un peu plus loin, nous avons également inclus un court ""Kühl-canon"" arrangé par Joris Weimar pour flûte, piano et 3 voix masculines (nos merveilleux collègues João Moreira, Mattijs van de Woerd, en Marc Pantus).

</div></div>","****English version****Please scroll down for Dutch and French!******KÜHL, NICHT LAU is our upcoming CD of music for flute and fortepiano. It features some of our favorite music from the early 19th century: Beethoven's Serenade (op. 41), Kuhlau's Grande Sonate Concertante in A minor, and accompanying gems. The title of the CD comes from the text of a short canon written by Beethoven as a pun on Kuhlau's name. An unconventional and decidedly curious phrase!,- for us it has become a endearing symbol of the connection between two great composers.Hopefully, the CD will be ready for release by December, 2019. We would be grateful, thrilled, and thankful if you could help us bring this special production to life by contributing any amount you wish. In return, we've put a lot of thought into how we can say THANK YOU! Check out our rewards and perks over there on the right!!We are Tami Krausz (flute) and Shuann Chai (fortepiano): a musical duo based in the Netherlands with a special interest and love for performing our repertoire on historical instruments. It is with great pleasure that we announce our upcoming CD of works by Beethoven and Kuhlau!The inspiration for this project came about on a train: Tami was returning home to The Hague, fresh from another recording at the Louvre Museum in Paris. The experience had been a very enriching one, and the wish to continue the same in-depth work in the repertoire for flute and fortepiano was born. We immediately began 'cooking' the idea with intensive rehearsals, reading through the repertoire, and brainstorming over many mugs of coffee and tea. It quickly became clear that there was an interesting chemistry in the music of Beethoven and Kuhlau, and we were determined to dive in ""for the record""!We've already laid down the tracks in a three-day session this past February at the Westvest90 church in Schiedam (NL), a venue known for its intimate chamber-music acoustics. There, we put our performance in the capable hands of sound engineer Rainer Arndt, a specialist in recording historical instruments and founder of the Belgian recording label Ramée.It's a strong start, and now we really need your help to give this project a push so that we can bring the CD to completion.
 
Our recording is anchored by two pillars of the 19th century repertoire for flute and fortepiano: the Serenade of Beethoven, published in 1803 as his opus 41, bends the boundaries of Classicism with impulsive dynamic changes and measured attention to timing, while the Grande Sonate Concertante of Kuhlau (opus 85) reaches eagerly for a more Romantic aesthetic, inviting an expressive freedom in his virtuosic writing and rich harmonic textures. These tendencies are also reflected in his works for solo flute, here represented by the Capriccio in D minor, op. 10.
The inspiration to juxtapose the music of Beethoven and Kuhlau comes from the delightful account of their only meeting, which took place at a festive gathering in 1825. After a relaxing walk in the great outdoors, Kuhlau challenged his colleagues with a musical puzzle based on the tones B-A-C-H (B-flat/A/C/B-natural). Beethoven, tipsy from the champagne, apparently improvised a three-voiced canon on the spot but thought better of his attempt the following morning. He sent Kuhlau a note with a canon on the same theme, but with the added text ‘kühl, nicht lau‘ (cold, not lukewarm), a friendly pun on Kuhlau's name. This charming moment became the obvious title of our recording, and is honoured by a short 'Kühl-canon' on the CD: arranged by Joris Weimar and performed by flute, piano, and a trio of male voices (our illustrious colleagues João Moreira, Mattijs van de Woerd, and Marc Pantus), it brings the listener closer to a time when extemporization and musical riddles were a regular part of musicians’ lives. 

For this recording, Tami is playing a German eight-keyed wooden Flute from the beginning of the 19th century, and Shuann is playing on two different Fortepianos: a 5,5 octave piano built around 1800 by Johann Zahler of Brno,  and a 6-octave Viennese piano by Michael Rosenberger (ca. 1820), generously loaned by the Nationaal Muziekinstrumentenfonds. Ingeniously hand-crafted and rich in tonal variety, instruments such as these were the ones that composers like Beethoven and Kuhlau knew, and for which their pieces were written. We love that the specific timbre of these instruments provides us with the chance to enter a composer's sound world.

Enthusiasm and passion have given us the drive to get this far, but the reality is that there are many financial considerations to a recording project and they add up quickly. For example: 

CD production, editing, and mastering
CD manufacture, booklet printing, and stocking costs
Recording venue rental
Fortepiano rental, transportation and tuning
Travel and accommodation for the recording team
Professional photos and publicity materials

We have jointly shouldered the costs ourselves up until this point, but with your help we will be able to take it all the way and bring this CD to listeners all over the world!

Ludwig van Beethoven / Friedrich KuhlauKÜHL, NICHT LAU : Werken voor fluit en fortepiano
Tami Krausz, traverso fluit met 8 kleppenShuann Chai, fortepiano
Een opname vol prachtige muziek uit de 19de eeuw, uitgevoerd op historische instrumenten met Beethoven's Serenade op. 41, Kuhlau's Grande Sonate Concertante op. 85, en andere juwelen.
We hopen dat KÜHL, NICHT LAU zal in december 2019 worden uitgebracht, maar...... om dit project te kunnen realiseren hebben wij jullie hulp nodig!! Wij zouden je erg dankbaar zijn als je ons financieel zou willen steunen met welk bedrag dan ook. Om jullie te danken hebben we wat spannende beloningen aan de bieden, check it out!

Wie zijn wij en wat doen wij?
Wij zijn Tami Krausz en Shuann Chai: een kamer-muziek-duo uit Den Haag. Afgelopen 20 jaar hebben wij ons beiden met veel internationale optredens toegelegd op het brede repertoire van de 18e-20e eeuw, op historische instrumenten. Het is ons een groot genoegen om onze CD aan te kondigen met werken voor fluit en piano van Beethoven en Kuhlau. De CD is in februari 2019 opgenomen in de Westvest Kerk in Schiedam, die beroemd is om haar prachtige akoestiek voor kamermuziek. Ons optreden was in de ervaren handen en oren van geluidstechnicus Rainer Arndt, eigenaar en oprichter van de Belgische platenmaatschappij Ramée.
Wat heeft ons geïnspireerd om dit te doen?
Het idee kwam op in de trein: Tami was op weg terug vanuit een opname in het Louvre in Parijs, een verrijkende ervaring. De ambitie naar verdere verdieping in kamermuziek voor piano en fluit was geboren! Terwijl Shuann repeteerde voor een recital programma met een aantal optredens in Nederland realiseerdenzij zich dat de tijd rijp was om deze duo stukken op te nemen.
Als uitvoerende musici blijft een live concert onze grootste inspiratie. Het maken van een opname geeft ons de mogelijkheid om een extra uitdaging aan te gaan. De voorbereiding en concentratie die bij een opname komen kijken zijn daar de belangrijkste elementen van. Hoe dan ook blijft het doel voor ons hetzelfde: het verhaal van een componist vertellen.
Voor onze luisteraars proberen we deze twee magische werelden te combineren: de intieme ervaring van een concertzaal op onze CD en de precisie van een opnamesessie bij onze live-optredens.
“Kühl Nicht Lau” ?
Een charmant moment in de muzikale geschiedenis heeft ons tot deze titel gebracht:
De enige keer dat Kuhlau en Beethoven elkaar ontmoetten! Het was 1825. Na een ontspannen avondwandeling in Baden, met nog drie andere musici, daagde Kuhlau zijn collega's uit met een muzikaal puzzeltje gebaseerd op de naam van Bach (bes/a/c/b). Beethoven improviseerde ter plekke een driestemmige canon. De ochtend erna stuurde hij Kuhlau een brief met een betere versie van zijn canon. In deze versie voegt hij de tekst “ Kühl, nicht lau” toe, als aardigheidje voor Kuhlau. En hij biedt zijn excuses aan voor zijn ietwat overmatig champagne-gebruik.
Samen met arrangeur Joris Weimar en de drie prachtige stemmen van João Moreira, Mattijs van de Woerd en Marc Pantus hebben wij een aangepaste versie van deze canon kunnen toevoegen aan onze CD.

Iets over onze instrumenten:
In deze periode werd er gespeeld op allerlei soorten meer-kleppenfluiten en fortepiano's. Er werden veel nieuwe instrumenten en bouwtechnieken ontwikkeld. Componisten zochten grenzen en variëteit van expressie, klank en timbre. Dat was immers de tijdsgeest in deze overgangsperiode van Klassieke muziek naar Romantische muziek. Ook te zien in drama, literatuur en politiek.
Tami speelt op een 8-kleppige houten Duitse traverso, Shuann speelt op twee verschillende fortepiano's: Een Zahler piano (5,5-octaavs, 1800) en een Rosenberger (6-octaavs, 1820), met dank aan de National Muziekinstrumentenfonds.
Wat zijn de kosten?
Enthousiasme en passie hebben ons de drive gegeven om zo ver te komen, maar de realiteit is dat er veel financiële afwegingen zijn voor een opnameproject en dat de kosten snel oplopen. Enkele voorbeelden:

CD-productie, bewerking en mastering
CD-vervaardiging, boekjes afdrukken en opslagkosten
Verhuur van locatie voor de opname
Fortepiano verhuur, transport en stemming
Reizen en accommodatie voor het opnameteam
Professionele foto's en publiciteitsmateriaal

We hebben de kosten tot nu toe gezamenlijk gedragen, maar met uw hulp kunnen we onze CD  echt realiseren en naar luisteraars over de hele wereld brengen! 
Alvast veel dank voor uw steun!

<p><strong>Sandy Scofield’s Red Earth</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to my Indiegogo campaign! This is the first time I have done one of these, so please bear with me! :)</p>
<p><strong>About Me</strong></p>
<p>I am Cree/Métis; my ancestral family hails from Treaty One territory in Manitoba although I currently live, work and play on the unceded traditional territories of the Coast Salish peoples of the xʷməθkwəy̓əm (Musqueam), Skwxwú7mesh (Squamish), and Səl̓ílwətaɬ (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations.  </p>
<p>I come from a long line of singers and musicians, and have been performing since 1986.  My music draws from a wide range of genres including, pop, folk, jazz and rock, and traditional Indigenous song. I sing in Cree having been mentored by many language speakers, song keepers and elders.</p>
<p>I also hold an undergrad degree in music from Simon Fraser University, Burnaby BC. During my studies, I had the opportunity to learn about African music at the University of Ghana in west Africa. In addition to performing, I work as an educator, mentor, music director, composer and sound designer supporting the artistic voices of other Indigenous performers in theatre, dance and film. I love working and collaborating with others and I pass on knowledge and skills, in the way I was taught, at every opportunity.</p>
<p>Music had provided me with many opportunities to tour performing internationally, and I have been honoured with many awards (WCMA Winner, CFMA Winner and three Juno Nominations). I am currently recording my sixth release entitled Red Earth.</p>
<p><strong>About Red Earth</strong></p>
<p>Red Earth, the CD and vinyl recording, is an eclectic collection of songs spanning a few music genres, typically Sandy-style!  There are two traditional hand drum songs, one given to me by song keeper Ray Thunderchild and the other I wrote; there is a Cajun two-beat song featuring the accordion stylings of Nova Devonie; a jazz piece with master keyboardist Michael Creber, a folk song written for Colten Boushie and Tina Fontaine, a couple older tunes I have never recorded and seven more assorted Sandy-style tunes! I am a story teller and you can be sure each tune tells a story.</p>
<p>The core musicians on the CD have been playing, recording and touring with me for 15 years now and are no strangers to my diverse writing style. My backup musicians are:</p>
<p>drummer Randall Stoll (k.d. lang, Tom Cochrane), guitarist Stephen Nikleva, and,</p>
<p>bassist Brian Minato (Sarah McLachlan).</p>
<p>Tracks include guests Tantoo Cardinal, Raven Kanatakta, Andrea Menard, Dawn Pemberton, Darren Parris, Michael Creber, Nova Devonie and Deanna Gestrin, and future guests include Kinnie Starr, Pura Fé and cellist Cris Derksen. The title is Red Earth and the cover painting is called Healing the Earth, mixed media , by Anishnaabekwe artist Janice Toulouse.</p>
<p>Songs are being tracked in Vancouver at Heavy-o-Sonic Studios (Marc L’esperance) and edited and mixed at Stonehill on Bowen Island (Shael Wrinch).  Mastering will transpire by Graemme Brown at Zen Mastering (<a href=""http://www.zen"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.zen</a><a href=""http://mastering.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mastering.net</a>). </p>
<p>This project is important because it’s been fourteen years since I released a CD of original work. During this time, I’ve grown as a human being, writer, and performer, and I am excited about sharing my new work more broadly.</p>
<p><strong>About the Campaign</strong></p>
<p>With seed money from Canada Council for the Arts, I recorded seven original songs; all tracks require editing, mixing and mastering.  I recently recorded an eighth song,and intend to record another four original songs. Through this campaign I hope to raise $8000 to record the additional four songs, to do all editing, mixing, mastering and manufacturing of 13 songs in total. These funds will also pay for graphics for marketing materials and a web site update and redesign by Diitiidaht/Kyuquot/Coast Salish graphic designer Carmen Thompson. She will also create graphics for the recording’s front and back covers, liners notes and lyric booklet for the CD as well as promotional posters.</p>
<p>This Indiegogo Campaign will ensure that everyone involved in this project is compensated for bringing to life the finished recording.</p>
<p>I love the idea of Indiegogo because it enables you to support and interact with me directly.  For example, you can book me for a home concert and introduce my music to your community. Or you can order music downloads or physical CD’s.</p>
<p>If you can’t contribute financially to the campaign, you can still help bring Red Earth to life by spreading the word and the music on social media, and by sharing with your friends and relatives, and by offering good thoughts and prayers for the realization of this project.</p>
<p>I lift up my hands in thanks and appreciation for all of your support.</p>

If you can’t contribute financially to the campaign, you can still help bring Red Earth to life by spreading the word and the music on social media, and by sharing with your friends and relatives, and by offering good thoughts and prayers for the realization of this project.
I lift up my hands in thanks and appreciation for all of your support.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>This will be my first studio recording since I arrived in NYC!</h3>
<h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I have been in New York now since 2009. Since that time I have established myself as a full time musician (no easy task!) both as a performer and teacher. </span></h3>
<h3>
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I have performed at many wonderful venues such as Birdland, The Iridium, Jazz At Kitano, Zinc Bar, Cornelia Street Cafe and soon at 55 Bar in June and a debut at the acclaimed Mezzrow in August.  I need a sparkling new recording to help me to go even further in my career. And I would love to have your help!</span> </h3>
</div><div>
<h3>I am asking for $20,000 to help cover the costs of the recording:</h3>
<p>This breaks down to $12,000-15,000 in recording costs and prodincluding fees to pay my wonderful band. And 5,000 to $7,000 for promotion including print media and radio and new photos.</p>
<ul>
<li>I have some wonderful and unique gifts for you! Anything from a physical CD or download to a private concert or personalized Happy Birthday for you or a loved one. In honor of my new song, <b style=""font-style: italic;"">Love Spell,   </b>I will even help you cast your own love spell!</li>
<li>If we don’t reach the goal of $20,000, I will use the funds I do raise in this flexible campaign to put toward recording the album and I will do it in stages. It would be great if I could record this year and release it early next year in 2020!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>A brand new recording is important for me because</h3>
<p>It will go a long way in helping get to the next level in my career. I have been a lifelong musician, performing professionally since I was 15 years old in a rock band in Houlton Maine. I put myself through college singing with a big band starting when I was 18 years old. I have won various awards in my career, like a full scholarship to Jazz In July in Amherst MA for two years, another full scholarship to Jazz Aspen SnowMass and had some special honors including  opening for Billy Taylor and Max Roach, singing a private concert for Barbara Streisand and James Brolin among them.  Help me to be able to share this extraordinary music and these amazing musicians with the world! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Of course there are always many risks and challenges along the way in the life and career of an artist. Even though I am living and working in the most exciting city in the world for jazz, New York City, it isn’t easy to survive much less be able to create.

<p>Hi, I’m Michael Henszey and I’m a singer/songwriter from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. </p>
<p>What do St. Elmo’s Fire, Sledgehammer, and Perestroika have in common? They mark the year I graduated from college and dove into the deep end of the music scene. Since then, I’ve worked with amazing musicians, owned and operated a recording studio, produced music for national ads, and released my own songs periodically.</p>

<p>I’m now excited to announce the release of my fifth CD, entitled PLAY ON! It’s been four years in the making and represents a huge labor of love. </p>
<p>Some listeners already know that my songs tend to be introspective and personal. I’m always seeking to connect with people through my own stories of love, tears, triumphs, struggles, and redemption. This theme continues with PLAY ON.</p>
<p>Please mark your calendar for a CD release show March 29 at Shank Hall. 8 pm.</p>
<p><strong>AMPLIFY my visibility</strong></p>
<p>I invite you to help me get my music in front of more people. You can amplify my visibility and help me reach a wider audience. I hope my songs will have an impact on people, touching them in some way.</p>
<p>After all these years, I still cherish the thought that I can write and record music, share it, and make someone’s life a little more tender, more comprehensible, and more connected with the lives of others.</p>

<p><strong>GOALS</strong></p>

<li>Production fees: Funds will defray the $2000 cost per song to record, mix, master, and pay musicians. </li>

<p>The Shalom Chorale is a group of sensational singers with a passion for music and faith in God. In times like these, when news of violence, disunity and rumours of war seem to dominate our world, we feel there is a need for peace, hence our name <i>Shalom Chorale</i>.</p>
<p>Last year, for the first time ever, we entered in for the BBC Gospel Choir of the Year competition, where after a selection from entries all around the UK, we were chosen as one of the 5 finalists. In preparation for the finals, led by our music director, Femi - with God’s help and our extreme passion for music and excellence, we worked really hard and travelled to Nottingham for the finals last October. This was aired on national TV, BBC One in November. At the finals, we emerged winners with an unanimous decision from choir supremo judges - Gareth Malone OBE (known for presenting BBC Two’s <i>The Choir</i>), Karen Gibson (Founder &amp; Conductor, <i>Kingdom Choir</i>) and singer-actor, Shaun Escoffery (played <i>Mufasa</i> in west-end show, ‘The Lion King’).</p>

<p>Since winning the competition, we have continued to go from strength to strength. Shortly after then, we made our debut live radio performance on BBC Radio London where we also recorded some live music for the festive season. As part of an exciting last few months in 2018, we appeared last December as the headline act for Christian Aid UK’s <i>Gospel Christmas</i> Concert, and we have also partnered with charitable organisations such as Robes UK and Look Ahead Hackney Road Project.</p>
<p>So far this year, part of our highlights have been receiving the Bazil Meade 'Award for Choral Excellence' in Manchester, recording live performances for BBC Songs of Praise in Bolton, headlining this year's Good Friday Concert <i>Dark Sacred Nights</i> at Union Chapel, London, and performing at the UK premiere movie screening of Aretha Franklin's iconic live album recording <i>Amazing Grace</i>.</p>

<p>We are grateful to God for all these opportunities and we believe it is time for us to make more impact with our music, hence, we will be recording our debut album. As it has always been our practice from day one, we put in our very best into whatever we do, to achieve high standard results. For our debut album, we have already been in talks with a high end UK-based music producer as well as looking at high spec recording studios in London and we all can’t wait to start working on this album. However, as much as this all sounds exciting, the major challenge lies with funding. The album production process involves the following and your kind donation will go a long way in helping to cover these essential costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Pre-production</strong>: This is where it all starts as it involves creating the arrangements for each song on the album. We will hold rehearsals and meetings with the musicians and producer, a vital process required to help integrate our creative energies - giving the very best start to the production of the album.</li>
<li>
<strong>Production</strong>: This is the most important aspect of the production – when we actually go into the studio to record with the singers, session instrumentalists, sound technicians and producer. We will be putting in a lot of work into this and it is necessary that we make bookings at the studio to ensure we have enough time to capture the beautiful music you will eventually get to hear on the album.</li>
<li>
<strong>Post-production</strong>: Our legendary music producer, composer, arranger and sound engineer, who has decades of experience working with world renowned solo musicians, including Andre Crouch, and choirs in and outside the UK, will be working hard to get the tracks mixed and mastered, making sure that you have a great listening experience from the first track to the last!</li>

<h3>What this means to us...</h3>
<p>We cannot express how much impact producing this album will have on us as a group and as individual members of the choir. For the <i>Shalom Chorale</i>, we have been blessed to have such awesome leadership from our music directors and singing in this choir has helped form a life-long bond between every member of the group, regardless of our background. As cliché as it might sound, our individual lives have been tremendously impacted by being in this group, and it is safe to say that we are now a family. As a choir family, we love to work together – staging performances (in concert halls, churches, public spaces and charities within our communities) – and so far, we have seen how much positive impact our music has had on our audience during our performances. People from different backgrounds come up to us, expressing how our soulful and engaging performances has given them peace, joy, hope or even made them cry. We just can’t’ imagine how much more lasting impact our album will have on people’s lives – providing a platform where they don’t only get the chance to listen to us live, but even when we are asleep or about our daily activities, they can still listen and be blessed through our music. To state the obvious, producing this album would really mean a lot to us, not just creating a lasting impact on our lives but also for our dear listeners all over the world!</p>

<h3><strong>What we are creating:</strong></h3>
<p>Palisades Virtuosi embarks on this 7th volume with a special 2-CD set of all the works they have commissioned and premiered that include a narrator or singer.  PV explores a world beyond the purely instrumental with “Songs &amp; Stories”, a compilation of fairy tales, legends, poetry, artists and newly crafted story-telling.  </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need: </strong></h3>
<p>Since this is a  2-CD set it is a much more expensive venture for us to complete than previous projects. We have been fortunate to have some seed money saved and have begun the recording process. However we need to raise enough to complete the rest of the recording and all of the production, editing &amp; mastering and distribution of the final product.  So we turn to you, our patrons, friends and music lovers to help us fulfill our mission. With your support we can bring this music to music lovers everywhere!   We need to raise $15,000 to cover the remainder of our recording time, artist fees, our producer's fee, the distribution fee for Albany Records and marketing for the finished product. We have completed 6 CD projects in the past and can be trusted to complete what we begin. Your <strong>tax deductible contributions</strong> will go to our sponsoring entity, PV Music Trio, Inc, a 501(c)(3) organization, therefore, any contribution you make will be tax-deductible to the fullest extent determined by the law.</p>
<h3><strong>What music is being recorded?</strong></h3>
<p>Seymour Barab’s “The Sea Princess”, an operetta based on the original Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale, Thomas Juneau’s “Songs from the Laurel Tree”, a song cycle of poems about the mythical Daphne and Apollo, Jeffrey Kaufman’s “Paterson” based on the poem by William Carlos Williams, Martin Sedek’s “Portraits of Van Gogh” which portrays the life of the artist through 4 of his most famous works, Roger Stubblefield’s “Fire Diamond”, a programmatic work based on a new legend of the composer’s creation, Kerry Turner’s “Vathek Revisited” based on readings from the 19th Century novel by William Beckford and as a special treat, “El Dorado” a short song about that mythical city of gold by our pianist who is also a composer himself, Ron Levy.</p>
<p>We are thrilled to be joined on this project by Barbara Dever, mezzo-soprano from the Metropolitan Opera, Frank Basile, internationally renowned opera singer and narrator, rising star Timothy Maureen Cole, soprano, and cellist, Marisol Espada.</p>
<h3><strong>Who we are:</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Palisades Virtuosi is a flute, clarinet and piano trio dedicated to commissioning, premiering and promoting new music for our ensemble. </strong>We have been passionately committed to this creation and promotion of new music and composers since we set about on our “Mission to Commission”® in 2003.  In just 16 years we have created an amazing library of over 85 new works for our ensemble with the help of publicly funded grants and individual contributions. We believe by virtue of its sheer volume and the pace with which it has been created, this library is unmatched by any other ensemble in recent history.  Palisades Virtuosi champions new music not only by well-known composers but also by up and coming voices in the new music world. </p>
<p>While we are dedicated to performing these new works multiple times live to be sure they have ample exposure, there are only so many people who will get to hear them at all. That is why it is so important to us to preserve and distribute these pieces through recorded sound so that music lovers all around the world can hear them too!  Although there are substantial grants available to help commission these works, there are unfortunately very few grants that actually help to support the recording process. A big part of our ""Mission to Commission"" is to make sure that all of this new music can be heard by as many people as possible. So far we have recorded 6 CDs of these newly commissioned works on our “New American Masters” series for Albany Records.  </p>
<h3><strong>Rewards:</strong></h3>
<p>Free CD's, Free Tickets, Free T-Shirts and other special perks will be yours should you choose to support this project.  But the best reward of all is knowing that you are bringing new music to the world that would not be available any other way! </p>
<p>If we do not reach our entire goal by the end of this campaign we will continue to reach out to our patrons and other supporters who are not online to help us reach our goal. Your contribution will definitely go to this project and not be diverted to something else if we don't make our entire goal. </p>

The core rhythm section, Steve, Kork, John, and Dan got the ball rolling with a few songs. Unfortunately, about six months into the writing phase, Steve Jordan died suddenly and unexpectedly. We feel lucky to have recorded him in a studio on the first four songs, and we will use those drum tracks on the finished album.  We decided to not replace Steve, but instead to use different drummers on different songs. We have been able to recruit three (so far) as well as numerous other singers, songwriters, and musicians to jump in. All of the guests play with working bands, which helps us spread the word and the music. Workflow:The songs are mostly being written by Dan  and Korky.

We feel so blessed to be on this journey and for the special relationships we have made along the way.<br/><br/>A lot of you may have seen this already, but for those who haven't; below is a short documentary from 2 years ago called ""A Morning with Coyote &amp; Crow.""

<h3>About Me &amp; My Project</h3>
<p>My name is Gráinne Brady and I am an Irish fiddle player and composer from Co. Cavan, based in Glasgow (<a href=""http://www.grainnebradyfiddle.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.grainnebradyfiddle.com</a>). I have been working on an exciting new project on Irish immigration which will culminate in the release of my debut album 'The Road Across the Hills' in February 2019, and need your help to bring the first step of this project to fruition . </p>
<p>'The Road Across the Hills' will be tracked, mixed and produced by award-winning musician and composer Mike Vass, and will feature household names from across Scotland’s traditional and classical music scene: Innes White, Andrew Waite, Steve Forman, Su-a Lee, Megan Henderson and Feargus Hetherington. </p>
<p>Exploring themes of immigration and extreme poverty, I took inspiration from the work of Irish poet and writer Patrick MacGill - the music for the album will act as a soundtrack to his autobiographical novel ‘Children of the Dead End’. Each track on 'The Road Across the Hills' was written in response to pivotal moments in the novel; a book that has stuck with me since first reading it as a child. The ten-track album will also feature Donegal native Jack Houston reciting abstracts of MacGill’s evocative poems. Incorporating spoken word - as well as percussive sound effects and field recordings - will augment the tracks, creating a dramatic soundscape throughout the album. Combined with stunning album artwork by Somhairle MacDonald, a listen to ‘The Road Across the Hill’ will truly be an immersive experience.</p>
<p>Born in Glenties, Co. Donegal in 1889, MacGill emigrated to Scotland in the 1900s and began to discover his talents as a writer whilst working as a labourer on the railways in Glasgow and as a navvy in Kinlochleven. His writings reflected on his growing preoccupation with the poor, the downtrodden and the workers who, like himself, toiled in the mud to build civilisation but lived on the outside of society. </p>
<p>It it my hope that this music will take the listener on a journey; from MacGill's childhood in rural Donegal, to gruelling labour in Scotland, as a potato picker, or ‘tattie howker’, labourer and navvy, with some colourful characters along the way, as well as a bittersweet story of love and loss. Entwining the musical tale with words from the man himself, acting as a reflection upon the story, will add even more depth to the soundtrack.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To make an album and promote it properly, it is costing me £11,000. Hard to believe right?! Here is a very basic breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Studio costs, mixing &amp; mastering - £3000</li>
<li>Paying guest musicians properly - £3000</li>
<li>Artwork, CD pressing &amp; distribution - £2000</li>
<li>Promotion in UK&amp;Ireland and on social media - £3000</li>
</ul>
<p>I am self-funding more than half of this but need some help to raise the rest. I have set up some exciting perks for you to choose from, from pre-orders of the CD to tune commissions and house concerts!</p>
<p>If I do manage to reach my goal it will cover the artwork, pressing, distribution and promotion which would be amazing! If I manage to surpass this, the money will be invested into the BEYOND project, which also will include an album tour of Ireland and Scotland, and further recordings based on these themes.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I think that this project is different and will make an impact on many listeners who will be able to relate to some of the themes I am exploring; immigration, poverty and struggle. Many people in Scotland are of Irish descent and this will be be a view into some of the struggles that our ancestors endured to make a living, and to make the world a better place today.</p>
<p>Emigrating from Donegal to Scotland in the 1900s, MacGill’s writing depicts the hardships endured by both the Irish and Scottish lower class and highlights the enduring hope that drove their determination to succeed despite the odds – an enduring concept just as relevant today in the discussions around immigration as when MacGill was writing.</p>
<p>I moved to Glasgow in a much more enlightened time and am privileged to be able to make a living doing what I love to do – writing and playing music. The compositions are not only inspired by this tale but are also a reflection of my own musical journey over the last few years.</p>
<p>I currently play with MG Alba Scots Trad Awards nominees Top Floor Taivers, string group The Routes Quartet, and Gaeilge/Gàidhlig supergroup LAS. I have been involved in several album projects over the years, which have given me the experience needed to undergo the process of releasing a solo album. I also have a wealth of experience in event planning and project management, organising two festivals - Islay Sessions and Shawfest - and managing all aspects of the Fraser Shaw Trust including promotion, website, social media, events and partnerships.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>You may have noticed I have budgeted £3000 for promotion? This might seem like an awful lot, but in order for the album to be heard, money needs to be invested in hiring a PR agent. In my case I want my album promoted across the UK and Ireland which is costing extra. A PR agent has all the contacts needed to get your music out there, obtaining reviews from music magazines, local and national newspapers as well as setting up interviews and organising radio play. Without a PR agent, the album just won't get essential publicity - I learned this the hard way unfortunately.</p>
<p>Another hurdle is getting hard copies of the album sold. This will be mostly done online and at live gigs, but I plan on also getting them out there via a distributor, which I have also budgeted for. I will also be touring the album all over Scotland and Ireland so hope to sell lots of hard copies then too!</p>
<p>So my two main hurdles - getting the music heard and getting albums sold - can be overcome by investing the money in the right places and doing a lot of the groundwork myself such as booking gigs and generally managing the project well.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you don't have a CD player, or maybe can't afford to help, that's okay. You can still contribute to the cause by spreading the word, sharing this page or talking about my project to anyone you think might be interested in hearing about it. A little goes a long away and if you're reading these words, then you've read the whole spiel so thank you for reading!</p>
<p>If you can help in any way, big or small, you will be making a big difference to an independent artist so a million thanks!</p>

Incorporating spoken word - as well as percussive sound effects and field recordings - will augment the tracks, creating a dramatic soundscape throughout the album. Combined with stunning album artwork by Somhairle MacDonald, a listen to ‘The Road Across the Hill’ will truly be an immersive experience.
Born in Glenties, Co. Donegal in 1889, MacGill emigrated to Scotland in the 1900s and began to discover his talents as a writer whilst working as a labourer on the railways in Glasgow and as a navvy in Kinlochleven. His writings reflected on his growing preoccupation with the poor, the downtrodden and the workers who, like himself, toiled in the mud to build civilisation but lived on the outside of society. 
It it my hope that this music will take the listener on a journey; from MacGill's childhood in rural Donegal, to gruelling labour in Scotland, as a potato picker, or ‘tattie howker’, labourer and navvy, with some colourful characters along the way, as well as a bittersweet story of love and loss. Entwining the musical tale with words from the man himself, acting as a reflection upon the story, will add even more depth to the soundtrack.

What I Need & What You Get
To make an album and promote it properly, it is costing me £11,000. Hard to believe right?! Here is a very basic breakdown:

Studio costs, mixing & mastering - £3000
Paying guest musicians properly - £3000
Artwork, CD pressing & distribution - £2000
Promotion in UK&Ireland and on social media - £3000

I am self-funding more than half of this but need some help to raise the rest. I have set up some exciting perks for you to choose from, from pre-orders of the CD to tune commissions and house concerts!
If I do manage to reach my goal it will cover the artwork, pressing, distribution and promotion which would be amazing! If I manage to surpass this, the money will be invested into the BEYOND project, which also will include an album tour of Ireland and Scotland, and further recordings based on these themes.

The Impact
I think that this project is different and will make an impact on many listeners who will be able to relate to some of the themes I am exploring; immigration, poverty and struggle. Many people in Scotland are of Irish descent and this will be be a view into some of the struggles that our ancestors endured to make a living, and to make the world a better place today.
Emigrating from Donegal to Scotland in the 1900s, MacGill’s writing depicts the hardships endured by both the Irish and Scottish lower class and highlights the enduring hope that drove their determination to succeed despite the odds – an enduring concept just as relevant today in the discussions around immigration as when MacGill was writing.
I moved to Glasgow in a much more enlightened time and am privileged to be able to make a living doing what I love to do – writing and playing music. The compositions are not only inspired by this tale but are also a reflection of my own musical journey over the last few years.
I currently play with MG Alba Scots Trad Awards nominees Top Floor Taivers, string group The Routes Quartet, and Gaeilge/Gàidhlig supergroup LAS. I have been involved in several album projects over the years, which have given me the experience needed to undergo the process of releasing a solo album. I also have a wealth of experience in event planning and project management, organising two festivals - Islay Sessions and Shawfest - and managing all aspects of the Fraser Shaw Trust including promotion, website, social media, events and partnerships.

Risks & Challenges
You may have noticed I have budgeted £3000 for promotion? This might seem like an awful lot, but in order for the album to be heard, money needs to be invested in hiring a PR agent. In my case I want my album promoted across the UK and Ireland which is costing extra. A PR agent has all the contacts needed to get your music out there, obtaining reviews from music magazines, local and national newspapers as well as setting up interviews and organising radio play. Without a PR agent, the album just won't get essential publicity - I learned this the hard way unfortunately.
Another hurdle is getting hard copies of the album sold. This will be mostly done online and at live gigs, but I plan on also getting them out there via a distributor, which I have also budgeted for. I will also be touring the album all over Scotland and Ireland so hope to sell lots of hard copies then too!
So my two main hurdles - getting the music heard and getting albums sold - can be overcome by investing the money in the right places and doing a lot of the groundwork myself such as booking gigs and generally managing the project well.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you don't have a CD player, or maybe can't afford to help, that's okay. You can still contribute to the cause by spreading the word, sharing this page or talking about my project to anyone you think might be interested in hearing about it. A little goes a long away and if you're reading these words, then you've read the whole spiel so thank you for reading!
If you can help in any way, big or small, you will be making a big difference to an independent artist so a million thanks!",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p><strong>Where I'm at</strong></p>
<p>After years of waiting, I am finally in the studio wrapping up the finishing parts of recording my EP 1420. Now I am taking what I have done, and I am now in the process of mixing, editing and mastering the project. The conclusion of this chapter is so close, and I can’t wait to release these songs to the universe for you to hear!</p>
<p><strong>Why </strong><strong>love</strong><strong> songs?</strong></p>
<p>It seems that for many, the story of love is an easy one. For me, I have experienced the good and bad side of love. I have been hurt, and equally, have hurt other people. I write from my perspective currently, and I live in the moment. The next project could have nothing about love on it, or the story may continue, I have no clue. </p>
<p>I just love music. </p>
<p>It is my drug of choice, and I am one happy addict.</p>
<p><strong>Who am I?</strong></p>
<p>My name is BERNARD. I am singer/songwriter, musician, professor and lover of the life I am living. I currently reside in Lynchburg, VA. I was born and raised in Portsmouth, VA. My musical adventure started for me at age 4, when my parents forced me into church choir. I had no clue that it would bring me here. I have traveled with some different names in CCM/R&amp;B circles, but I feel most at home where I am now. Music changed my life.</p>

<p>In order for this project to get the care that it deserves, I am in need of $2500 in financial support. This amount will cover costs of musicians’ services, mixing/mastering and promotion of the project. Additionally, I will be shooting a music video for the project and documentary.</p>
<p><strong>Why now?</strong></p>
<p>More than ever before, our world needs something to bring us all together. This music project will assist with that. Music is the great unifier, and through this project, people will be able to look past the gaps that divide us to find that one thing that brings us all together, love.</p>

<p>International teachers have been contributing to the achievements of the Edward Said National Conservatory of Music since its inception 25 years ago and have given much to the overall music scene in Palestine; however, unlike a job in other countries where an organisation can apply for a work visa for their employees, as a Palestinian institution this option simply does not exist here. All international teachers here are facing challenges to stay, with many teachers being  denied entry to the country, facing stress and pressure when they travel in and out of the country and are sometimes obliged to travel several times hoping to get their visa renewed in order to be able to stay. If not denied entry, a ‘West Bank only’ permit  is being granted, often only a few months at a time, with restrictions preventing the international teachers from going to Jerusalem (where the Conservatory also has a branch) or travelling through Ben Gurion airport.   </p>
<p>The impact on the students and on the ESNCM’s ability to fulfill its musical and professional duty is profound. Students are often left without teachers, or have to change teacher regularly as we struggle to replace international staff. Continuity is a vital part of music education and this is being critically effected.   </p>
<p>USD 10,000 will go to cover travel expenses for visa renewals and contribute to fees for lawyers following the current cases to stop the deportation of some three teachers.  At least 10 teachers and eventually around 1000 music students in the conservatory will benefit from your support. If we raise more money than requested, we will put it towards our continuing legal efforts to be recognized as an institution that can apply for work visas.</p>
<p>The Conservatory works in music education and promotion. Through its music education and projects, it has positioned itself as a leading institution in music and performing arts scene in Palestine, and has advanced music appreciation and interest within the public and official spheres. It has developed a channeling process for aspiring musicians, and further democratized music practice and training while making it more professional.</p>
<p>The prolonged Israeli occupation with its devastating effects on all aspects of  life in Palestine has left Palestinians, in particular children and youth especially in marginalized communities, vulnerable and deprived of their basic rights; they are deprived of their rights to survive, be safe, belong and develop and hence to have opportunities to lead stable and rewarding lives.</p>
<p>Our work builds on the provisions of the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity stating that “the flourishing of creative diversity requires the full implementation of cultural rights as defined in Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in Articles 13 and 15 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.”</p>
<p>Help us achieve our goal and make a difference in the lives of young boys and girls by keeping their music teachers in the country. Help us keep professional international teachers in Palestine. Thank you for taking action and for telling others about our teachers and the young music talents facing many challenges to continue their music education.   </p>

The prolonged Israeli occupation with its devastating effects on all aspects of  life in Palestine has left Palestinians, in particular children and youth especially in marginalized communities, vulnerable and deprived of their basic rights; they are deprived of their rights to survive, be safe, belong and develop and hence to have opportunities to lead stable and rewarding lives.
Our work builds on the provisions of the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity stating that “the flourishing of creative diversity requires the full implementation of cultural rights as defined in Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in Articles 13 and 15 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.”
Help us achieve our goal and make a difference in the lives of young boys and girls by keeping their music teachers in the country. Help us keep professional international teachers in Palestine. Thank you for taking action and for telling others about our teachers and the young music talents facing many challenges to continue their music education.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>We are excited to talk to you about our upcoming project!</p>
<p>Immersion Repertory addresses contemporary social issues through innovative musical and theatrical programming. We seek to reimagine previously-performed work as well as commission and write new pieces.  </p>
<p>This time, we are excited to officially mark the beginning of a long-term collaboration.</p>
<p>For our April 20th concert, Can Your Hear Me?: Women’s Voices Seen and Heard, we will explore women’s voices – both literal and figurative - as they seek to be heard.  </p>
<p>We are performing entirely with string quartet, an arrangement of Mozart’s <i>Der Schauspieldirektor</i> and performing Victoria Bond’s <i>Molly Manybloom</i>.  </p>
<p>Additionally, we welcome young singers from Minnesota (both alumna of Immersion Youth Repertory‘s summer training programs) and the New York City Area to perform alongside professionals from NYC.  They will be performing an excerpt from Too Many Sopranos.  The whole concert will be staged by Misha Johnson, the Executive Director for Immersion Youth Repertory.</p>

<p>Making music is my biggest passion and  I'm excited to bring you in to be part of the creative process! The last record I made was 9 years ago in NY.

<h3>Just another radio station? Definitely NOT!</h3>
<p>Local radio in the UK has changed over the past 10 years.  After a series of mergers, acquisitions and takeovers it seems the idea of a local radio station all the family can enjoy are gone - and that's why we are here!</p>
<p>Broadcasting 24 hours a day and available on your phone, tablet, laptop or desktop - and with a very familiar name - Radio Victory is set to return on Monday 18 March 2019 as a truly localised station for the Portsmouth area.  We are a not-for-profit social enterprise, with every penny re-invested in the service - but we need your help to get the project up and running!</p>
<p>Our exciting station will target the 40+ audience, harnessing the latest technologies to deliver a vibrant localised radio station with a mix of music, news, sport, weather, travel, community information - everything that Radio Victory offered but now re-invented for 2019.</p>
<p>You can listen to our test transmissions via the webrad.io website - just click <a href=""http://www.internetradiouk.com/#radio-victory"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What We Can Offer:</h3>
<p>We need to raise £6,500 to launch the station.  Much of the preparatory work has already been done. We have trademarked the name, test transmissions are underway via our <a href=""http://www.radiovictory.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">website</a>, the studio is built and some presenters have been found.  If we can't raise all of the money in this crowd funding bid, we plan to run again minus whatever we have raised.  Provided the vital licence fees can be covered we are guaranteed to launch on time even if it has to be a limited service.</p>
<p>The funding we seek will allow us to operate for two years, by which time we will have won an audience and be able to sell advertising to fund our future plans to broadcast as a DAB station. </p>
<p>In return for your support we have put together some reward packages which we think will be of interest and ensure that Radio Victory really rocks!  Parts of our reward scheme includes advertising on our website as banner ads, programme feature sponsorship and conventional radio advertisements - so for the first year in order to honour these commitments we will not actively try to sell more.</p>
<p>We have produced a multi-page document which details the entire ILR project in some detail, if you want to read it you'll be able to download a *.pdf version <a href=""http://www.radiovictory.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/The-ILR-Project.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Lynn Speakman. I am a jazz musician, a composer and arranger, and a music educator. My primary instruments are alto saxophone and flute.</p>
<p>Marcus Printup (trumpet), born and raised in Conyers, GA, has been a member of Wynton Marsalis' Jazz At Lincoln Center Orchestra since 1993. I first met him in college when JLCO would tour in Michigan. When I lived in NYC, Marcus and his wife (and their two dogs) lived in the same neighborhood and I used to dog sit for them. They both became dear friends of mine and an incredible support system for me while I was in NYC.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I'm very excited to play with Marcus and to share him with my Pittsburgh community, and to share that community with him.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><strong>Marcus will be performing 2 concerts with my quintet in Pittsburgh this fall:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><strong>Saturday, August 31, 5:30-7:30pm at Backstage Bar @ Theater Square in downtown Pittsburgh</strong> </span></li>
<li><strong><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Sunday, September 1, 2:30-4pm at 25 Carrick Ave, a beautifully refurbished old church in a neighborhood just south of the Southside and Mount Oliver called Carrick </span></strong></li>
</ul>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">​</span>The Sunday concert will be a live recording and there will be a ""meet the artist"" Q &amp; A following the concert with Marcus.</p>
<p>In addition to myself and Marcus, the band will include <strong>Alton Merrell on piano, Jeff Grubbs on bass, and Kyle Andrews on drums</strong>.</p>
<p>We will be performing some of Marcus' and my original music as well as a few by some of our favorite artists.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need to raise $2,500 in order to break even for this project.</p>
<p>The money raised will go toward covering the cost of bringing a musician of this caliber in from out of town, paying the rest of the members of my band, and fees for use of the venue and live recording on Sept. 1.</p>
<p>A portion of the live recording as well as a video of the Q &amp; A will be available exclusively to my backers as a perk for supporting this project. Other perks include recognition in the program, autographed Marcus Printup CDs, and a VIP dinner with Marcus after the Sunday concert.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: 700;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Impact</span></p>
</div><div>
<p>Music is my absolute favorite way to bring people and communities together from all walks of life. I think we all have a lot to learn from people who are different from ourselves. I believe that the more we work together to cooperate and love each other no matter how different our backgrounds may be, the better this world will be.</p>
<p>Not only will the members of my quintet benefit from getting to know Marcus and sharing the stage with him, but I believe Marcus will benefit from the love and support both musicians and fans alike in Pittsburgh have to offer. It is my hope that through sharing in this experience, participants near and far will feel the impact in a very positive way.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The obvious risk here is that, if not one cent is donated, I'll have to come up with $2,500 out of my own pocket. I am willing to take that risk, because this is not about making money for me but rather about sharing music and positivity with each other and with the world. If I am able to make a positive impact on even one audience member or fellow musician's life, I have achieved my goal.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I, Ellie MacPherson, am weirdly obsessed with the American presidents. For the past year I've been doing a one woman show that I created about the presidents with my sweet band The Secret Service. Then I realized, gee, I know nothing about the First Ladies. Nothing! As I learned more about them I thought, ""hey! these babes are pretty rad! I wonder what they would have said if they had access to the social media platforms now offered?"" </p>
<p>And so! We have the opportunity to cover the classic No Doubt hit ""Just a Girl"" as the First Ladies. The music video we're looking to make is to also hype up our upcoming show about the First Ladies that we're performing on JFK's birthday Wednesday May 29th. It's fun and funny and hopeful. Which is everything America needs right now. ( I mean, not EVERYTHING, but you get it)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need around $2000 to make this vid, gotta get equipment and space and costumes out the wazoo and it's very important to pay the amazing musicians who rock. NYC is the best and the worst place to create because it's so rich with creatives but the most expensive city ever.  </p>
<p>And what do you get out of it?</p>
<p>   Your name on the video credits! A instagram post featuring a fun fact about a historically significant American that shares your name! Tickets to our First Ladies show!  Also! LAUGHS!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Look, we're already talking about the 2020 election. ALREADY. This is a good thing, but it's going to be so important to know who our potential leaders are as people. Flawed human people. And who their partners are can say a lot about the candidate's inner life. But maybe even more importantly, there has been such a lack of humor in our current political environment. If we can't laugh about ourselves and our history, we're in for a very unhappy existence. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Have you ever shot a music video? Or any video for that matter? It's all a risk and challenge. Living in NYC is a risk and a challenge. Being an artist, risk and challenge. BEING A PERSON. </p>

<p><i>Todas as sombras </i>é um verso retirado de <i>Alta Traición</i>, o primeiro tema original escrito por nós para este disco. <i>Todas as Sombras</i> porque em cada uma das canções que fomos gravando e produzindo ao longo deste ano há <i>sombras que foram montanhas</i> mas também há as <i>penas de cinza</i> ou a sombra que Saramago recorta da parede ou as <i>sombras antigas</i> do Tiago de Lemos Peixoto.

<h3>About StoryCRTV.</h3>
<p>StoryCRTV is short for Story Creative. It comes from the idea that the Bible, a collection of stories pointing to a singular narrative, the story of Jesus Christ is worth telling over and over again. StoryCRTV wants to help people find that their story is always part of His story. </p>
<p>In 2019 songwriter and worship leader Adam Michael Allison left his career &amp; business in pursuit of God's calling to pastor the local church in full-time creative arts and church strategy ministry. In 2020 he started writing and God started giving him opportunities not only to lead in the local church but to write and record music to help people find hope in a year that has reshaped the world. </p>
<p>StoryCRTV's goal for 2020 is to record 5 songs of hope. To date, 1 song has been recorded and released 'Majesty' to all streaming platforms and the second is in progress. We need your help to ensure this vision of 5 songs for hope reaches a world in desperate need of the only hope, Jesus. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Ask.</h3>
<p>Recording music is expensive and doing it correctly, well that is even more expensive. How expensive you ask? Each song costs about $2500 to create, produce, market, and release. You have studio time and recording costs such as a producer, musicians, mixing and mastering, marketing, and distribution costs plus the percentage it costs to do this fundraiser. It adds up quickly, not to mention travel to and from Nashville. </p>
<p>The ask is that through your generosity we raise $12k to finish the last 4 songs! Now how this works is you can choose to give at a level that you feel comfortable with each level having some perks for you as well! </p>
<p>If we reach the total goal we will be able to record the final 4 songs this year. If we reach part of the goal we will record as many as the budget allows. If we go over the amount then we will record as many songs as are funded! (Yes, that could happen and yes we have enough songs to do an entire album!) </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why?</h3>
<p>StoryCRTV wasn't ever intended to be anything other than sharing the hope to a hurting world. The world we live in needs hope, and the truth is music can change everything if it is pointing people to the greatest story ever told. It started with a chorus, and a new vision for a middle-aged white guy far past his 'prime' but knowing he is standing right in the middle of God's ask of him in this season. Join the story, make history, help spread the gospel of Jesus Christ. We dare you to be a part of the movement!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have to make at least $2700 to do one more song! In a world that is cash poor this such a crazy ask, but one we know is worth it! </p>
<p>However, we know this is going to be so much more than that. The goal is to do 1 song a month for the next 4 months as the funds begin to roll in. We've already taken the step of faith and paid for the first two songs, one of which is already out there, the second which will be recorded in August. We'll be working side by side with long time producer Conrad Johnson and an all-star cast of musicians chiming in! </p>
<p>The challenge isn't songs. The challenge isn't talent. The challenge isn't faith. The challenge is me asking for help. I'm not great at asking for help. I've taken a ton of the risk but I also know that people believe in what we are doing here and so the vision has been given and the challenge has been accepted and I'm asking for your help! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help!</h3>
<p>A contribution isn't the only way you can help. I desperately need your prayers. Nothing is more important the laying this all before the Lord. Ask for continued inspiration. </p>

<h3>De opnames</h3>
<p>De opnames van de twaalf nummers worden opgedeeld in 3 sessies. In iedere sessie worden 4 liedjes opgenomen. De songs worden 3 keer achter elkaar gespeeld, zodat er genoeg materiaal is om audio en video te editen. Iedere sessie duurt ongeveer een uur en zijn gepland op onderstaande tijden:</p>

<h2><strong>The Time To Pray: THE DOUBLE ALBUM</strong></h2>
<p>This year has been one of extraordinary challenge, but also one of inspired creative opportunities. My Facebook Live concerts, streamed online (18 so far, and counting) have yielded 28 new spiritual compositions, including new settings to words by Mary Baker Eddy, Jill Gooding, William Luce and from the Bible. They also included my first proper single, Bill Luce’s <i>This Is The Time To Pray</i> (May 2020), which even entered the UK Christian music chart!</p>
<p>From the kind and generous feedback I’ve received, I know this music has already reached far and wide and been greatly appreciated. Many listeners have also made donations to support this work, and that’s been so precious for me and my family during this tricky time - thank you. Composing and playing is my contribution to the healing practice, and I am both touched and grateful to know that this is bearing fruit. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>And now I must humbly ask you for more help, so that I can do this work justice and share it even more widely.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>I am planning a brand new double album of songs</strong>, including <i>Abide With Me, In The Secret Place, As A Child, The Peace of God, The Father Is Calling, Let No Wall Divide Us, The Tide Of Love</i> and new settings of four of Mrs Eddy’s poems, among many others. You can listen to a sample of some of them at <a href=""http://www.thetimetopray.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.thetimetopray.com</a>.</p>
<p>Any support you are able to give this project would be so gratefully received. Your generosity will help to pay for the arranging, the recording, the producing, the musicians and the final manufacture of the double CD itself. I plan to have it ready to launch during my early summer tour of the USA’s west coast at the end of May.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Music reaches beyond national and denominational borders; it can lift, heal and connect with people of all beliefs and none. I’d love this work to bless more people - and it’s never been more important than now to find ways to connect with and support our fellow children of God.</p>

<h2>Mantra Music Medicine for the Mind Body &amp; Soul</h2>
<p>Namaste, my name is Elise and I am a singer-songwriter, musician, kirtan leader, and a yoga teacher.</p>
<p>I have launched this crowdfunding campaign to seek support to record and release my 3rd album - a new mantra CD of some of the favourites from my kirtan gatherings (my group devotional singing events) and concert tours, so that everyone can sing along at home.</p>
<p>Mantra's are so profoundly powerful... they have helped me heal and supported me through many difficult times in my life, so I really know their value first hand. Which is why I share them with so much love and devotion. They truly are medicine for the soul, and the medicine we need in the world during these challenging times. <strong>They bring us home to the heart, to find the deep peace within, the love of the divine, the unity and connection we are ALL craving... We quite literally begin to vibrate with peace and everything else drops away. </strong> I have watched so many people moved to tears by this music over the past 2 years since it began flowing through me, such that I feel like a guardian of it, not a composer, just a channel, to which I wish to serve and honour as best I can. The practice of guiding others in singing the mantras has given great purpose to my life, and I now feel this purpose is carrying me, rather than the other way around... I wish to give this music to the world for all who need to receive its blessing in a recorded form.</p>
<p>I now lead Kirtan wherever I am asked to go. As well as regular events in my beloved local community in South Devon, this purpose has taken me to India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Corfu, Amsterdam and Spain. I feel deeply grateful to be able to share my practice, and my hearts greatest joy with others in such a variety of communities and cultures around the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>My Musical Background, First 2 Albums &amp; Debut EP</h3>
<p>My debut album <a href=""https://www.eliseyuillcohen.com/music"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">'Scarlet Begonia's and EP 'A Thousand Angel's Tears'</a> were of a folk singer / songwriter flavour, yet overtime my journey as a yoga practitioner, my spiritual path, and my musical creativity all dovetailed into one unfolding pathway. I fell in love with gathering people to sing mantra, to pray and drop together into the deep peace of the heart found in the ancient wisdom of these mantras. </p>
<p>Earlier this year (2019) I made my 2nd album - a <a href=""https://www.eliseyuillcohen.com/music"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lakshmi</a> mantra meditation album, to support a charity that I hold deep within my heart - the <a href=""https://www.eliseyuillcohen.com/heartoflivingyoga"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Heart of Living Yoga</a> - they fund many global projects, helping some of the poorest children in the world and their families, some of whom I visited in person earlier this year in Sri Lanka. 50% of the proceeds of the Lakshmi album go directly to fund such projects. </p>
<p>And so now it is time to share more of these wonderful chants for everywhere I go I am touched to hear the words ""can I buy the mantra album?"" to which I reply...... Yes - soon - I promise!!! I just need to record it! And so here we are....</p>
<p>THANK YOU SO MUCH for taking the time to read this far... and for whatever way you are able to support me to give this music to the world. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get - £10,000 FUNDRAISING GOAL</h3>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT I NEED</strong></p>
<p>I am asking for the help to raise £10,000 as a resource that would be my ideal album budget for production and release. This will cover all recording &amp; CD production costs including studio time, paying musicians (my dear friends who will also be helping me produce this album myself), mixing, mastering, disc manufacture - basically everything musically technical, plus all the graphic design elements that go into making and releasing an album, as well as all social media graphic elements that are required created by my designer <a href=""http://marietillbert.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Marie Tilbert</a>.</p>
<p>This budget will also cover the cost of the crowdfunding campaign video, AND fund a new music video with my photographer and videographer <a href=""https://www.lucidproducing.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Julian Marcus</a>, which will help support the release of the album. </p>
<p>Additionally, I will be seeking support from a PR company to help me send the album out around the world to reach new hearts and voices. </p>
<p>Furthermore, if I reach my ideal target I will make a Mantra Song Book - with all the chords, words and explanations, so you can learn to play them at home!</p>
<p>Also included in the budget is the 10% fees and transaction charges that Indiegogo (this crowdfunding platform) takes for their services.</p>
</div><div>
<p>I've set my target on Indiegogo at £7000, which is the minimum budget I need to make the album. I wouldn't be able to include the music video, additional PR support for the release of the album, or mantra song book with this budget, but it would enable me to make the music and release the album through my website.</p>
<p>However, I am hopeful that with your support I will reach my ideal goal of £10K!!! And, I will be so grateful for whatever I receive.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU GET</strong></p>
<p>In return for supporting my campaign by selecting one of the 'Perks' from the list, you can choose your return gift - from the digital download of the album, to signed CDs, full discography packages, tickets to the launch event, private event bookings (Devon UK only - for events further afield please enquire by email to: elise@eliseyuillcohen.com) and more...</p>
<p>So you can support to whatever level you feel you can offer help - there are some 'Guardian Angel Donation' options for those who would like to give more to help with the creation of this album.</p>
<p>Your contribution really will be an essential part of this - we are making it together because I actually cannot make it without you.</p>
<p>I will be sending regular email updates in the form of a newsletter to share behind the scenes insider info! Keeping you posted on all the steps of the creative process, with photos, videos and blogs. And..... YOU GET a lot of love flowing your way from me to you!!!! </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Time Scale</h3>
<p>I am planning, hoping and intending for the album to be ready for release by spring 2020.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Past Discography - Digital Downloads &amp; CDs</h3>
<p>All past discography orders; digital downloads and CDs (2014 A Thousand Angels Tears EP, 2017 Scarlet Begonias Album &amp; 2019 Lakshmi Album) will be emailed and posted to you as soon as the campaign ends.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Pre-ordering the album and making contributions to the campaign are not the only way you can help if you would like to support me. Other ways you can support include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help me get the word out and make some noise about my campaign on Facebook, Instagram and twitter. </li>
<li>You can do this easily by using the Indiegogo / Facebook / Twitter share tools!</li>

Namaste, my name is Elise and I am a singer-songwriter, musician, kirtan leader, and a yoga teacher.
I have launched this crowdfunding campaign to seek support to record and release my 3rd album - a new mantra CD of some of the favourites from my kirtan gatherings (my group devotional singing events) and concert tours, so that everyone can sing along at home.
Mantra's are so profoundly powerful... they have helped me heal and supported me through many difficult times in my life, so I really know their value first hand. Which is why I share them with so much love and devotion. They truly are medicine for the soul, and the medicine we need in the world during these challenging times. They bring us home to the heart, to find the deep peace within, the love of the divine, the unity and connection we are ALL craving... We quite literally begin to vibrate with peace and everything else drops away.  I have watched so many people moved to tears by this music over the past 2 years since it began flowing through me, such that I feel like a guardian of it, not a composer, just a channel, to which I wish to serve and honour as best I can. The practice of guiding others in singing the mantras has given great purpose to my life, and I now feel this purpose is carrying me, rather than the other way around... I wish to give this music to the world for all who need to receive its blessing in a recorded form.
I now lead Kirtan wherever I am asked to go. As well as regular events in my beloved local community in South Devon, this purpose has taken me to India, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Corfu, Amsterdam and Spain. I feel deeply grateful to be able to share my practice, and my hearts greatest joy with others in such a variety of communities and cultures around the world.
 
 
My Musical Background, First 2 Albums & Debut EP
My debut album 'Scarlet Begonia's and EP 'A Thousand Angel's Tears' were of a folk singer / songwriter flavour, yet overtime my journey as a yoga practitioner, my spiritual path, and my musical creativity all dovetailed into one unfolding pathway. I fell in love with gathering people to sing mantra, to pray and drop together into the deep peace of the heart found in the ancient wisdom of these mantras. 
Earlier this year (2019) I made my 2nd album - a Lakshmi mantra meditation album, to support a charity that I hold deep within my heart - the Heart of Living Yoga - they fund many global projects, helping some of the poorest children in the world and their families, some of whom I visited in person earlier this year in Sri Lanka. 50% of the proceeds of the Lakshmi album go directly to fund such projects. 
And so now it is time to share more of these wonderful chants for everywhere I go I am touched to hear the words ""can I buy the mantra album?"" to which I reply...... Yes - soon - I promise!!! I just need to record it! And so here we are....
THANK YOU SO MUCH for taking the time to read this far... and for whatever way you are able to support me to give this music to the world. 
 

 
What I Need & What You Get - £10,000 FUNDRAISING GOAL
 
WHAT I NEED
I am asking for the help to raise £10,000 as a resource that would be my ideal album budget for production and release. This will cover all recording & CD production costs including studio time, paying musicians (my dear friends who will also be helping me produce this album myself), mixing, mastering, disc manufacture - basically everything musically technical, plus all the graphic design elements that go into making and releasing an album, as well as all social media graphic elements that are required created by my designer Marie Tilbert.
This budget will also cover the cost of the crowdfunding campaign video, AND fund a new music video with my photographer and videographer Julian Marcus, which will help support the release of the album. 
Additionally, I will be seeking support from a PR company to help me send the album out around the world to reach new hearts and voices. 
Furthermore, if I reach my ideal target I will make a Mantra Song Book - with all the chords, words and explanations, so you can learn to play them at home!
Also included in the budget is the 10% fees and transaction charges that Indiegogo (this crowdfunding platform) takes for their services.

I've set my target on Indiegogo at £7000, which is the minimum budget I need to make the album. I wouldn't be able to include the music video, additional PR support for the release of the album, or mantra song book with this budget, but it would enable me to make the music and release the album through my website.
However, I am hopeful that with your support I will reach my ideal goal of £10K!!! And, I will be so grateful for whatever I receive.
 
WHAT YOU GET
In return for supporting my campaign by selecting one of the 'Perks' from the list, you can choose your return gift - from the digital download of the album, to signed CDs, full discography packages, tickets to the launch event, private event bookings (Devon UK only - for events further afield please enquire by email to: elise@eliseyuillcohen.com) and more...
So you can support to whatever level you feel you can offer help - there are some 'Guardian Angel Donation' options for those who would like to give more to help with the creation of this album.
Your contribution really will be an essential part of this - we are making it together because I actually cannot make it without you.
I will be sending regular email updates in the form of a newsletter to share behind the scenes insider info! Keeping you posted on all the steps of the creative process, with photos, videos and blogs. And..... YOU GET a lot of love flowing your way from me to you!!!! 
 
Time Scale
I am planning, hoping and intending for the album to be ready for release by spring 2020.
 
Past Discography - Digital Downloads & CDs
All past discography orders; digital downloads and CDs (2014 A Thousand Angels Tears EP, 2017 Scarlet Begonias Album & 2019 Lakshmi Album) will be emailed and posted to you as soon as the campaign ends.

 
Other Ways You Can Help
Pre-ordering the album and making contributions to the campaign are not the only way you can help if you would like to support me. Other ways you can support include:

Help me get the word out and make some noise about my campaign on Facebook, Instagram and twitter. 
You can do this easily by using the Indiegogo / Facebook / Twitter share tools!
If you want to go that extra mile, and have a newsletter, you could include this campaign as a feature. Say that you are supporting this artist (me!) because... (you fill in the blank!) and encourage friends and followers to do the same, in whatever way they feel moved to.

Most importantly, thank you for taking the time to read this and for whatever you do to support me, even if it's just sending some prayers and blessings of the heart... I truly believe it all counts.  With love and eternal gratitude...Namaste,Elise Kamala (Yuill Cohen)xxx",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

music is unique. My goals as an artist are defined by more than just

 much needed monetary contributions that will go towards finishing the 
album, marketing, touring and promotion. I want to make this album 
something that will be remembered for going above and beyond while 
giving my fans exactly what they want. It may seem like simple goal to

that you share this information with your network and those who 
appreciate the value of great music. I want to shake up the world. I 
want to continue challenging the status quo that wants to dictate what 
qualifies as modern music. I want to aspire to inspire. I want to 
command the attention of those that didn't think we could do it. I want 
to do all of this, but do it with you. Thank you from the bottom of my

<p>Hello, everyone.  My name is Rich Brown.  I live in Toronto, and I play the electric bass.  I've been blessed with the opportunity to work with artists ranging from Rudresh Mahanthappa, Donny McCaslin, Steve Coleman, and Dapp Theory to artists such as Jane Siberry, Bruce Cockburn, Angelique Kidjo, and James Blood Ulmer.   </p>
<p>I'm asking for your contributions to aid in finishing, and promoting my next album with my brand new band rich brown &amp; the abeng.  The album has been recorded, and it sounds fantastic.  But the studio fees, and musicians' fees have broken the piggy bank.  At this point the album has yet to be mixed, mastered, designed, and manufactured.  </p>

I've spent the past two to three years recording a new CD, ""Leaving the Path"". My first CD, ""Rain on Broken Glass"", was released back in 2008, so this new recording has been a long time coming. The recording, mixing and mastering is done, all that is left is getting the CD made. As a DIY (do it yourself) artist, I have kept the cost of recording and producing relatively low. The CD was recorded in my home studio. This has allowed me to take my time and do it right. The mixing and mastering was done by my friend Chad Ross, who has done all the recording and post production work for the band he and I both play in, called ""Rusty Nail"".</div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">All that remains to be done is to have CDs made, so that I can share this music with fans and friends. This is where you come in. Six hundred and fifty dollars will make it possible to complete the process. I'm not asking for thousands because I don't need thousands, With today's technology, big budgets for recording and making CDs are just not necessary. </span></div><h3><span style=""background-color: initial;"">About the music</span></h3><div>I play progressive world music, featuring the Native American Flute and Irish Whistle. My first CD was mostly solo pieces done in the traditional style of play for Native American Flute (for the record, I am not of Native American descent, but the NAF is the instrument that speaks to me). The new CD is a departure from that, as the title ""Leaving the Path"" implies. The new recording is more upbeat, with world percussion, calimba and other instruments accompanying the flutes. A couple of guest musicians also are featured in several songs. The record explores folk traditions from places like Scandinavia, the Middle East, the Andes and elsewhere. There are also modern flavors of blues, jazz and progressive rock at play in the music, and a heavy dose of experimentation. This is not the new age meditation music people have come to associate with the Native American Flute and flute music in general. This is something different, something I've put my heart into. </div><h3>About me</h3><div>In my younger years, I played a number of instruments (trombone, keyboard, harmonica...) with varying degrees of success. While intrigued with music, I just wasn't finding the right match for me. In my mid-thirties, events led me to the Native American Flute.  Within a month of first playing it, I was hooked. This was the instrument I was looking for all my life, capable of expressing emotion in a way that no other instrument can. <span style=""background-color: initial;"">The flute has changed my life in ways too numerous to count, leading to friendships and experiences that have enriched my life.  </span>
</div><h3>How you can help</h3><div>In many ways, this solo project has been a group effort. Many people have helped out by playing music for the record, mixing and mastering the CD, and doing layout work on the CD cover. Now you can help too, by contributing to the project.

I studied classical piano at the age of 6, have played guitar since I can recall and have performed since the age of 8. I taught at Musician's Institute, produced my first worldwide release at the age of 21 and have since produced others and have been a featured artist on records over the years. </p>
<p>I am a passionate, professional Musician of thirty years now and am blessed to have had my music on the charts in both Europe and Japan. This year (2015) it is time to produce the music and songs that I am writing deriving from Life's experiences and challenges. From Ho Down to Heartbreak to good 'ol Rock and Roll, it's a collection of introspective, thought provoking material that evokes joy, sorrow, laughter and dance. Contributors will assist in getting the music recorded, produced and heard by professional industry colleagues in an effort to market me again worldwide.</p>
<p>Today the price of producing a professional quality record comes at a relatively lower cost. Compared to the times when a record company would front a band hundreds of thousands of dollars to make a record, I'm asking for a rather modest sum to get the ball rolling. I have already secured a state-of-the-art studio, a master engineer and additional musicians all of whom are excited about this project. </p>

If I reach my goal of $10,000, 4% of it goes to Indiegogo and is subject to an additional 3-5% processing fee.

who’s passionate about the music of the Great American Songbook.<span>  Some folks label it jazz, some call it the standards,
while others just refer to it as “that stuff that Michael Bublé sings.”  Whatever you call it, I believe that it’s the
greatest gift that America has given to the arts, and I’m proud to keep this
music alive by singing the classics, as well as what some are calling the “New
American Songbook.”</span></p>
<p>In my adopted hometown, I’m
known as “San Francisco’s Favorite Crooner,” a moniker which suits me just
fine!<span>  I’ve released 2 previous
self-funded CDs, one a musical journey through the Great American Songbook
called <b><i><a href=""http://www.russlorenson.com/index.php/release/a-little-travelin-music/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">A
Little Travelin’ Music</a></i></b>,” and the other a holiday album, <b><i><a href=""http://www.russlorenson.com/index.php/release/what-i-want-for-christmas/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">What
I Want For Christmas</a></i></b>. 
Both albums made the initial Nominating Ballot for the 2006 Grammy
Awards, something for which I am still extremely proud.</span></p>
<p>Both CDs contain the song that
I am arguably best known for – a lovely tune originally written for Tony Bennett
called <i><b>Christmas in San Francisco</b></i>:</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""580"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fw.soundcloud.com%2Fplayer%2F%3Fvisual%3Dtrue%26url%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fapi.soundcloud.com%252Ftracks%252F179336621%26show_artwork%3Dtrue%26in%3Drusslorenson%252Fsets%252Fruss-lorenson-what-i-want&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Frusslorenson%2F11-christmas-in-san-francisco%3Fin%3Drusslorenson%2Fsets%2Fruss-lorenson-what-i-want&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi1.sndcdn.com%2Fartworks-000098780423-4oe9vv-t500x500.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=soundcloud"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p>With
extensive radio play on the #4 ranked Adult Contemporary radio station in the U.S.
(96.5 KOIT FM), that song and the album became the basis for my annual holiday
show, which has become a tradition for many in the Bay Area.  In honor of my 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary as
a nightclub artist, <a href=""http://www.hotelnikkosf.com/feinsteins.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Feinstein's
at the Nikko</a> in San Francisco is hosting me in a retrospective
series of my most popular shows from the past, as well as a brand new show I'm
creating for the series.  And it will all
culminate in my 10<sup>th</sup> annual holiday show, which will double as a CD
release event for my new CD, <b><i>In The Holiday Spirit</i></b>.</p>
<p>So why record another holiday
album?<span>  The Golden Age of the Great
American Songbook (from the 1920s through the 1950s), was also the Golden Age
of Christmas Music.  The same composers
and performers who created the canon of the Great American Songbook were the
same ones writing these gorgeous holiday tunes that we all know and love.  Think about Irving Berlin writing “White
Christmas” for Bing Crosby or Nat King Cole singing “The Christmas Song”
co-written by his friend Mel Tormé. So
my passion for the great standards extends naturally to holiday music.</span><br/><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1343722/files/20150331162356-lights_russ.jpg?1427844236"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p>
<p>But the other reason is that,
plain and simple, I just LOVE Christmas music.<span> 
For me, it evokes a nostalgic, romantic vision of what the holidays can
be.  I certainly never had the “Norman Rockwell” Christmas while growing up, but I
still strive for it by singing these songs and putting on my show, and I hope
in the process, I bring a little bit of that to my audience. And while the new album
will have several chestnuts from Golden Age composers like Sammy Cahn and Hugh
Martin, there will also be great contemporary songs in the same style, all backed by the amazing Kelly Park Big Band!</span></p>

artist an “advance” to pay for all the expenses involved in recording a CD, like
studio time, paying musicians for their performances, engineers, producers,
mixing, mastering, album artwork, and even the cost of manufacturing
the CD.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: until the
artist pays back all the money the record label lent them in
the form of an “advance,” the artist doesn’t make a dime from the record’s
sales. And, in exchange for that “advance” the record label exerts a lot of
control over the artistic content of the album. It’s a little like borrowing
money for a house and then the bank gets to decide how you’ll furnish it – and you
can’t live in the house until you pay back the loan!</p>
<p>With this campaign, I am asking all of
you to be directly involved in the production of <b><i>In The Holiday Spirit</i></b> from the very start without having it
funded by a record label.<span>  While I’ll be
released and distributed by the same label as my previous CDs – the <b><u>WONDERFUL</u></b> <a href=""http://lmlmusic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">LML Music</a> – I do not get an advance from them
to record.  But I do get to keep the
majority of the income it generates, and the artistic direction is all mine - while
still having worldwide retail and online distribution.</span></p>

<p>I plan to raise $20,000 and spend it
in the following ways:</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1311177/files/20150320123801-Budget_graphic3.png?1426880281"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>
</p><p>One of the major goals of <b><i>In
The Holiday Spirit</i></b> is to get expanded radio airplay around the U.S. and
the world.<span>  According to InsideRadio.com,
in 2014 there were 529 U.S. radio stations that switched to airing all-holiday
tunes, an increase of almost 10% from 2013.  The
format’s appeal transcends every demographic and gender, according to iHeartMedia
(formerly ClearChannel), which alone has 76 stations that switch to an
all-holiday format.  Increased radio
airplay translates to increased CD sales, and even more importantly, <u>increased
live performance opportunities</u> for me and the band.  It’s absolutely crucial that this CD be both artistically
and technically as good as can be, which is why I'm spending the extra money
required to record in a modern, state-of-the-art studio instead of the
converted garage where I recorded my first two CDs.</span></p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.studiotrilogy.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/bkg_slide_004.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/>
<p><br/></p><p>Once I meet
our initial goal of $20,000, any additional funds raised will go towards the
mixing and mastering of an EP.<span>  In 2009, I recorded two live performances of my show <b><i>Standard Time</i></b> at The
Metropolitan Room in New York.  There is enough usable material to create a 6-9 track EP, featuring music by “New
American Songbook” composers like Tony DeSare, John Pizzarelli, Michael
Feinstein, and even a song I co-wrote with my longtime musical director, Kelly Park!  You
can hear a few of the unmixed raw recordings on <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/rl-productions-2/sets/standard-time-live-at-the"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">my
profile at SoundCloud</a>.  It would be
wonderful to actually release this EP commercially, and I could do it with an
additional $3000-$5000.  </span></p>

series of my most popular shows from the past, as well as a brand new show I'm
creating for the series.  And it will all
culminate in my 10th annual holiday show, which will double as a CD
release event for my new CD, In The Holiday Spirit.
So why record another holiday
album?  The Golden Age of the Great
American Songbook (from the 1920s through the 1950s), was also the Golden Age
of Christmas Music.  The same composers
and performers who created the canon of the Great American Songbook were the
same ones writing these gorgeous holiday tunes that we all know and love.  Think about Irving Berlin writing “White
Christmas” for Bing Crosby or Nat King Cole singing “The Christmas Song”
co-written by his friend Mel Tormé. So
my passion for the great standards extends naturally to holiday music.
But the other reason is that,
plain and simple, I just LOVE Christmas music. 
For me, it evokes a nostalgic, romantic vision of what the holidays can
be.  I certainly never had the “Norman Rockwell” Christmas while growing up, but I
still strive for it by singing these songs and putting on my show, and I hope
in the process, I bring a little bit of that to my audience. And while the new album
will have several chestnuts from Golden Age composers like Sammy Cahn and Hugh
Martin, there will also be great contemporary songs in the same style, all backed by the amazing Kelly Park Big Band!

In the old days, a record label gave an
artist an “advance” to pay for all the expenses involved in recording a CD, like
studio time, paying musicians for their performances, engineers, producers,
mixing, mastering, album artwork, and even the cost of manufacturing
the CD.
But here’s the thing: until the
artist pays back all the money the record label lent them in
the form of an “advance,” the artist doesn’t make a dime from the record’s
sales. And, in exchange for that “advance” the record label exerts a lot of
control over the artistic content of the album. It’s a little like borrowing
money for a house and then the bank gets to decide how you’ll furnish it – and you
can’t live in the house until you pay back the loan!
With this campaign, I am asking all of
you to be directly involved in the production of In The Holiday Spirit from the very start without having it
funded by a record label.  While I’ll be
released and distributed by the same label as my previous CDs – the WONDERFUL LML Music – I do not get an advance from them
to record.  But I do get to keep the
majority of the income it generates, and the artistic direction is all mine - while
still having worldwide retail and online distribution.

I plan to raise $20,000 and spend it
in the following ways:

One of the major goals of In
The Holiday Spirit is to get expanded radio airplay around the U.S. and
the world.  According to InsideRadio.com,
in 2014 there were 529 U.S. radio stations that switched to airing all-holiday
tunes, an increase of almost 10% from 2013.  The
format’s appeal transcends every demographic and gender, according to iHeartMedia
(formerly ClearChannel), which alone has 76 stations that switch to an
all-holiday format.  Increased radio
airplay translates to increased CD sales, and even more importantly, increased
live performance opportunities for me and the band.  It’s absolutely crucial that this CD be both artistically
and technically as good as can be, which is why I'm spending the extra money
required to record in a modern, state-of-the-art studio instead of the
converted garage where I recorded my first two CDs.
Once I meet
our initial goal of $20,000, any additional funds raised will go towards the
mixing and mastering of an EP.  In 2009, I recorded two live performances of my show Standard Time at The
Metropolitan Room in New York.  There is enough usable material to create a 6-9 track EP, featuring music by “New
American Songbook” composers like Tony DeSare, John Pizzarelli, Michael
Feinstein, and even a song I co-wrote with my longtime musical director, Kelly Park!  You
can hear a few of the unmixed raw recordings on my
profile at SoundCloud.  It would be
wonderful to actually release this EP commercially, and I could do it with an
additional $3000-$5000.  
I’ve put together some fantastic
rewards to give all of you in exchange for your support. I have everything
from digital downloads of individual tracks and the whole album, VIP guest passes
for shows at Feinstein’s, a private wine tasting party for you and 7 of your
closest friends at a winery in California, and a lot more! And everyone who
gives will have my eternal gratitude!  Truly,
every little bit helps more than you know and I will be so grateful to have you
as part of this project. Check out the perks below!


Whether it's $5 or $1000, every
contribution will go towards the production of In The Holiday Spirit,
which will be released in December 2015. 
But I know that
times are tough, and I appreciate anything (even a dollar!) you can give to my
project. 
And if it's not a good time
right now to pitch in with funds, you can still be a very important part of this project!!

Use the Indiegogo share tools and spread the word on
     Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, Instagram, or YouTube using the
     hashtag #holidayspiritCD– every
     share actually helps by moving us up on the Music project page here on
     Indiegogo so that more people can find out about us. 

Come to a show – I’d love to see you in person at one of my
     shows.  Supporting live music is what it’s
     all about!

<p></p><p>Old Salt is a group that’s best described as a collective, not so much a traditional band.  Mainly because we’re working and living in many different countries and have so far only managed to come together about twice a year for two-three weeks at at time since 2013. This time though, we've decided to take the leap and organize a short tour, the end of which would result in an album.  And we've succussfully recorded the album!  If you're reading this it's probably being mixed and mastered this very moment! </p>
<p>
</p><p>We began this amazing yet intense journey in Ghent, Belgium at the incredible citywide festival called the “Gentse Feesten” and worked our way north, through the Netherlands, past Hamburg, right by Copenhagen and into Stockholm.  All the while busking, gigging and paying our way from the “hat.”  One of many gigs we played was on a train taking us from Stockholm up to Näsåker, Sweden at Urkult Folk Festival where we had an amazing experience performing.  And finally onward to Umeå, Sweden where we successfully recorded our First album!!  Our now dear friend Nils Johansson, in his recording studio “Ballerina Audio” was our miracle sound engineer who surpassed all of our expectations. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We can easily say that this tour and recording project was a challenge!  We’re all so proud of each other for persevering through the 16 hour work days, and teetering physical health, long days in the car and tough financial risks and decisions.  This is where our lovely crowd funders and supporters come in!  </p>
<p>
</p><p>What we’re asking for in this ""crowd funding"" campaign is 4,100 Euros (4,570 USD) for the recording mixing and mastering.  The remaining 2,000 Euros will go towards offsetting some of the travel costs requested by the members.   For instance the 400 Euros it cost Dave Barfoot from Edinburgh to fly to Belgium, and then a return ticket from Umeå back to work in Scotland.  The 210 Euros for Lara’s flight home in time for a gig that very night. Lotte and Johannes traveled home together by train and van from Sweden to Ghent, Belgium.  Anton’s flight down to Ghent from his home in Sweden.  This does not include any food or lodging costs, or any travel costs during the tour itself.  Basically we're asking to offset some of the cost of getting to and from the studio. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We had a dream to take this project to the next level and so far we have pulled through and come out with a really great response to our music and performance and what's turning out to be an album we're all really really happy with.  This Album will inevitably take us to the next level, and help us plan next years summer festival tour which is already beginning to line up!  We really took a big leap with this project, and now were asking for our friends and musical community to pitch in whatever they can to see us through to the next phase of our development.  We need help folks! And there's only a matter of hours left!! </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><br/></p><p>A little about us:</p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> The Americana sound is our general foundation that brings a bit of New Orleans to meet Appalachia and the North East American folk revival.  Along with the cross cultural influences of it’s band members who’s styles come from many different European musical traditions.  We feel our music comes alive through our spontaneity and improvisation.  We all share a common love for the pub session and the street where we really feel on the same plain as our audience.  </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>We’re from all over, and this means convening in the same place and time is a rare opportunity.  We met through an epic gathering of musicians in Slovenia back in 2013. As a broader group of about 12 members, we’ve since managed to converge about twice a year in some constellation for a couple weeks at a time.  This year’s group has manifested as six core musicians who were able to commit to a tour which takes us up to the North of Sweden to record an album (not including a few special guests here and there).  So, after six months of planning, we’ve decided to just go for it and record the album! </p>
<p>
</p><p>We all thank you from the bottom of our hearts for supporting us on this journey!  With a lot of hard work and passion we can make this a reality!  </p>

This time though, we've decided to take the leap and organize a short tour, the end of which would result in an album.  And we've succussfully recorded the album!  If you're reading this it's probably being mixed and mastered this very moment! 

We began this amazing yet intense journey in Ghent, Belgium at the incredible citywide festival called the “Gentse Feesten” and worked our way north, through the Netherlands, past Hamburg, right by Copenhagen and into Stockholm.  All the while busking, gigging and paying our way from the “hat.”  One of many gigs we played was on a train taking us from Stockholm up to Näsåker, Sweden at Urkult Folk Festival where we had an amazing experience performing.  And finally onward to Umeå, Sweden where we successfully recorded our First album!!  Our now dear friend Nils Johansson, in his recording studio “Ballerina Audio” was our miracle sound engineer who surpassed all of our expectations. 

We can easily say that this tour and recording project was a challenge!  We’re all so proud of each other for persevering through the 16 hour work days, and teetering physical health, long days in the car and tough financial risks and decisions.  This is where our lovely crowd funders and supporters come in!  

What we’re asking for in this ""crowd funding"" campaign is 4,100 Euros (4,570 USD) for the recording mixing and mastering.  The remaining 2,000 Euros will go towards offsetting some of the travel costs requested by the members.   For instance the 400 Euros it cost Dave Barfoot from Edinburgh to fly to Belgium, and then a return ticket from Umeå back to work in Scotland.  The 210 Euros for Lara’s flight home in time for a gig that very night. Lotte and Johannes traveled home together by train and van from Sweden to Ghent, Belgium.  Anton’s flight down to Ghent from his home in Sweden.  This does not include any food or lodging costs, or any travel costs during the tour itself.  Basically we're asking to offset some of the cost of getting to and from the studio. 

We had a dream to take this project to the next level and so far we have pulled through and come out with a really great response to our music and performance and what's turning out to be an album we're all really really happy with.  This Album will inevitably take us to the next level, and help us plan next years summer festival tour which is already beginning to line up!  We really took a big leap with this project, and now were asking for our friends and musical community to pitch in whatever they can to see us through to the next phase of our development.  We need help folks! And there's only a matter of hours left!! 


A little about us: The Americana sound is our general foundation that brings a bit of New Orleans to meet Appalachia and the North East American folk revival.  Along with the cross cultural influences of it’s band members who’s styles come from many different European musical traditions.  We feel our music comes alive through our spontaneity and improvisation.  We all share a common love for the pub session and the street where we really feel on the same plain as our audience.  

We’re from all over, and this means convening in the same place and time is a rare opportunity.  We met through an epic gathering of musicians in Slovenia back in 2013. As a broader group of about 12 members, we’ve since managed to converge about twice a year in some constellation for a couple weeks at a time.  This year’s group has manifested as six core musicians who were able to commit to a tour which takes us up to the North of Sweden to record an album (not including a few special guests here and there).  So, after six months of planning, we’ve decided to just go for it and record the album! 

We all thank you from the bottom of our hearts for supporting us on this journey!  With a lot of hard work and passion we can make this a reality!

</div></div>","A voice anointed to penetrate an atmosphere, Jacqueline Dade is definitively an end-time instrument, fresh water from a pure stream, and a precious jewel to the Body of Christ.  Her 1995 rendition of, ""Tis So Sweet”, as featured on Daystar Television Network and the 2013 prophetic song and release of “I Believe to See”, continues to impact her listening audience around the world! 

While
graciously endowed by the Almighty God with many gifts and talents,
Psalmist Dade is especially known most for her unique and powerful
display of God’s Word through song. She has devoted herself to the
ministry of true worship as a result many opportunities have been
presented to perform, and record with such acclaimed artists,
songwriters and producers as Israel Hougton & New Breed, Aaron
Lindsey, Fred Hammond, Darwin Hobbs, David Frazier, Da’dra
Crawford-Greathouse and Steve Crawford of Lakewood Church, Nia Allen,
Jonathan Dunn, Tonya Baker, and others.  Most recently, she
was extended and accepted an invitation to perform at The Pentagon
and it was an awesome and humbling opportunity!Honored
to serve in the Kingdom of God for such a time as this, Psalmist
Jacqueline Dade continues to travel near and abroad lauding the sound
of true worship and praise through singing, teaching, and
exhorting.  





Over the past couple of years now, I have sensed very strongly that the time has come to fulfill the prophetic assignment to host a Live Worship Recording, not just for the sake of merely gathering a musical production, but more importantly a time of lavishly expressing our sincerest adoration and admiration to the Lord God Almighty. I hear very loudly in my ear the heart request of a people saying:     

Oh what an authentic sound that will yield an unprecedented God performance not limited to those who gathered that night but also to those who will hear the captured experience as recorded on that night.  What an auspicious honor to be selected to Host the gathering; Release heart melodies that will inspire, heal and promote forward movement to fulfill the purpose of God; Capture the sound; Produce the project and Distribute world-wide!


I am simply elated and while the journey has been challenging at times, I look forward to progressing most favorably in the work of the Kingdom of God---Blessing to all!!! 


FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2015, the highly anticipated Live Recording of Psalmist Jacqueline Dade will be held in Columbus, Ohio and it’s going to be epic!!! Dana Sorey, the Producer, Songwriter, and Arranger for Grammy Award winning artists Tye Tribbett & G.A., Jason Nelson, and Marvin Sapp, and I have been working very diligently to write and arrange melodies that will bring glory to God and bless the hearers. 

To host and produce
a high quality industry standard recording will require generous
financial donations from long-time supporters, my friends, family, as
well as new supporters, like you, who are browsing this financial
campaign page. Will
you join me, along with others to assist with the financial cost to
make this Live Recording a reality?
 

Some have inquired
privately how they might be able to contribute financially to the
quality production of this recording and have also encouraged me to
publicly extend the opportunity for persons to sow a financial seed
toward recording expenses.  It has been said time and time again that
many have been blessed by the unique ministry gift that God has given
me to sing HIS Word spontaneously and they are awaiting the
professional recording that will capture that flow!   


Thank you in advance
for participating
in this online campaign. I am
so
very excited you and other supporters will assist with the financial
cost of this major endeavor. Share it on social media (Facebook,
Twitter Feed, and Instagram) as well as emails and text messages.  I
believe with your help, our campaign will be a great success!!!

All funds acquired
from this campaign will be applied to all related recording cost such
