<p>I have been making things since I can remember. Ever curious, I was drawing, painting, baking, and creating my way through life. In June 2003, as a rising Junior at St Olaf College, I had a freak accident while working grounds crew. I had a very serious traumatic brain injury (TBI). I also had a TIA, or an almost stroke, due to a blood clot that passed through a hole in my heart and took temporary residence in my brain. The doctors called me a miracle patient because with lots of hard work and their diligence, I was able to return to college in the fall.</p>
<p>I dropped a math class and took ceramics, because I already knew how to throw. That’s when I got bitten by the clay bug! Since then I have continued my education at some of the top clay institutions in the country: RISD, The Clay Studio in Philadelphia, Red Dirt Studio in DC, and Cranbrook Academy of Art (where I earned my MFA). </p>
<p>Since returning home to Virginia, I have set up my studio in Charlottesville and started my business, Möbius Keramikk.  I have become an active part of the Cville arts scene, and taught at VCU and in my studio.  Most of my effort has been focused on developing my work and showing it at direct-to-consumer shows; highlights include The Brooklyn Museum this past fall, and this spring I will be at The American Craft Council show in St Paul.</p>
<p>Louis Sullivan stated form follows function. I have adapted that to color and line follow form. As a businesswoman, my aim is to let my work follow where it is asked to go. I have worked the craft-show circuit; the overwhelming response I have gotten from customers is that my work belongs in high-end retail stores.  The next step for me is to enter the wholesale market.</p>
<p>My goal for 2018 is to see if I can make a living as a maker through wholesale contracts, web sales, and regional fairs. In early December, I was formally invited to participate in NYNOW. A huge honor and a hefty price tag.  This campaign will give me the opportunity to explore the wholesale marketplace.  As it is a new venture I cannot know exactly what will happen or what I expect to happen, other than continue to learn where my pots want to end up.</p>
<p>I wish instead of keys this were a sketchpad as I do not have the words to express the gratitude I have for anyone helping me get my work where it wants to be. NYNOW will be an expensive show for me to attend, but it is “the big time”.  If I can make it there…</p>
<p>Costs:</p>
<p>·       Booth $4,095</p>
<p>·       Electrical: $124.35</p>
<p>·       Mileage Reimbursement (682 miles): $371.69</p>
<p>·       Tolls: $78.70</p>
<p>·       Parking: $250 </p>
<p>·       MTA: $50</p>
<p>·       Food: $210</p>
<p>Total $5179.74</p>
<p>This opportunity presented itself last minute. In a sense you could say I was ""discovered"" at the 11th hour. As a result I have had to commit to doing this show without securing the funding first. Whatever money you are able to give me will be used for my show expenses. While committing to this show – and raising the money to attend – is scary, one upside is that it has given me the perfect excuse to begin an online sales presence. It is an unexpected boon on many levels.</p>
<p>The Perks for you!</p>
<p>I love what I make and I want you to love it too. You will become part of how my business as it grows. As a thank you for donating, you have the option to receive a custom piece of art. If you decide you want logo cups I will work with your design goals. My plan is to listen and take advice. Have you thought about this type of form? This market? This show? I have said yes to everything possible (including this show) and it has helped define Möbius Keramikk. With this show and campaign I am entering into a new developmental stage and you get to be a part of it. I couldn't be happier! </p>
<p>Of course this is a risk as there is the potential for me to incur a lot of debt that could hinder Möbius Keramikk's ability to move laterally and vertically in the marketplace. But the positive possibilities outweigh the negative and with your assistance I am confident this is a risk worth taking.</p>
<p>What I would love from you: Obviously whatever level of financial assistance you can give, but also support and ideas. I have a lot of money to raise in a very short period of time. What could I do that I haven't tried? Do you know anyone who would be interested in my work and want to support it? Can you share this campaign? Or if you know that I have a product you love and it is not a perk let me know and I will work to make it yours by swapping perks. I am open! I love making these objects and using them and want to share my joy with you. </p>
<p>So thank you, thank you, thank you! Digital fist bumps are on me!!! </p>

<li>This campaign is important to me, because I know (and she's already AGREED TO GO) that attending this program called The Ascension Leadership Academy is going to be the secret sauce to her getting through her blocks... to become the confident, fearless, artist she wants to be.  I know this because some of my best friends and mentors went through this program and go on to do amazing things! </li>
<li>If you can help her achieve this, she will be able to believe in herself and sell her art!  I also will finally understand the power of asking for help which is going to help me achieve huge things within my own business....such as HELPING more people because I will have faith in asking for help to do this. Some things on the horizon is helping businesses become more universally accessible!</li>

My name is Andrew Soria, and I am a digital artist who specializes in creating photo collaged cityscapes of urban environments. For the past seven years, I've been creating and exhibiting these pop surreal cityscapes in galleries, and my work has even been featured in well-known art magazines. <i>(Juxtapoz magazine, Hi-Fructose magazine, Upper Playground, Plastik magazine, Mutant Space).</i> I first moved to LA with the intention of creating one of these iconic cityscapes. As I began to explore, I attained a deeper understanding of what the City of Los Angeles really is. I realized I could not simply encase the entire city in one of my detailed composites; rather, I quickly learned that LA is a complex and vibrant city made up of multiple unique neighborhoods.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519270182/ashv7h6k59rrv1ncfzei.png"" src=""""/></p><p>    At first glance, people recognize LA's many stereotypes—but its roots run much deeper. In reality, each neighborhood operates as its own unique community, acting as a sort of ""mini"" city within the greater Los Angeles area. In other words, you can experience a different lifestyle and culture simply by moving to a different neighborhood. Moreover, LA caters to just about everything and everyone, making it easy to find the lifestyle and community you want to be a part of. ""Welcome to the Neighborhood,"" will expose LA's one-of-a-kind world in the form of fifteen pop surrealism cityscapes. By embracing and blending LA's stereotypes with its idiosyncracies, I hope to showcase the raw, real, and honest version of Los Angeles! </p><p>    ""Welcome to the Neighborhood"" will include the following Los Angeles cityscapes: Venice, Skid Row, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Culver City, West Hollywood, Fairfax district, Hollywood, Koreatown, Silver Lake, Echo Park, Downtown LA, Fashion district, Arts district, and Boyle Heights. While there are many more habitats to include, I have chosen to start with these neighborhoods and add to this project overtime.  </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519266958/coqceiir5cagbz5nnyov.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>THE PURPOSE</strong></p><p>""Welcome to the Neighborhood"" aims to preserve the culture of  Los Angeles today, through the form of these cityscapes. Exclusively through this platform, I'll be offering postcards, limited prints, and original artworks. The funding raised through these sales will go toward the production and creation of these artworks. If I'm able to reach my stretch goal, I'll have a solo exhibition here in LA!</p><p> </p><p><strong>YOUR REWARD!</strong></p><p><i>A One-of-a-Kind 4""x6"" Postcard of Hollywood</i></p><p>Signed, numbered, and hand-inscribed postcards. These postcards will be a unique, collectible mini art print!</p><p><i>Limited edition fine art prints</i></p><p>You'll have the option between 10 different cityscapes, with 4 different print sizes. All on archival acid-free matte paper. These museum quality prints, will be signed, numbered and shipped to you safely!</p><p><i>Original limited edition artworks</i></p><p>For the avid art collector. An original c-print on fuji crystal paper, face mounted behind 1/4"" acrylic plexiglass with an aluminum dibond backing. These artworks are typically displayed in galleries, starting at $5,000.

My name is Andrew Soria, and I am a digital artist who specializes in creating photo collaged cityscapes of urban environments. For the past seven years, I've been creating and exhibiting these pop surreal cityscapes in galleries, and my work has even been featured in well-known art magazines. (Juxtapoz magazine, Hi-Fructose magazine, Upper Playground, Plastik magazine, Mutant Space). I first moved to LA with the intention of creating one of these iconic cityscapes. As I began to explore, I attained a deeper understanding of what the City of Los Angeles really is. I realized I could not simply encase the entire city in one of my detailed composites; rather, I quickly learned that LA is a complex and vibrant city made up of multiple unique neighborhoods.    At first glance, people recognize LA's many stereotypes—but its roots run much deeper. In reality, each neighborhood operates as its own unique community, acting as a sort of ""mini"" city within the greater Los Angeles area. In other words, you can experience a different lifestyle and culture simply by moving to a different neighborhood. Moreover, LA caters to just about everything and everyone, making it easy to find the lifestyle and community you want to be a part of. ""Welcome to the Neighborhood,"" will expose LA's one-of-a-kind world in the form of fifteen pop surrealism cityscapes. By embracing and blending LA's stereotypes with its idiosyncracies, I hope to showcase the raw, real, and honest version of Los Angeles!     ""Welcome to the Neighborhood"" will include the following Los Angeles cityscapes: Venice, Skid Row, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Culver City, West Hollywood, Fairfax district, Hollywood, Koreatown, Silver Lake, Echo Park, Downtown LA, Fashion district, Arts district, and Boyle Heights. While there are many more habitats to include, I have chosen to start with these neighborhoods and add to this project overtime.  THE PURPOSE""Welcome to the Neighborhood"" aims to preserve the culture of  Los Angeles today, through the form of these cityscapes. Exclusively through this platform, I'll be offering postcards, limited prints, and original artworks. The funding raised through these sales will go toward the production and creation of these artworks. If I'm able to reach my stretch goal, I'll have a solo exhibition here in LA! YOUR REWARD!A One-of-a-Kind 4""x6"" Postcard of HollywoodSigned, numbered, and hand-inscribed postcards. These postcards will be a unique, collectible mini art print!Limited edition fine art printsYou'll have the option between 10 different cityscapes, with 4 different print sizes. All on archival acid-free matte paper. These museum quality prints, will be signed, numbered and shipped to you safely!Original limited edition artworksFor the avid art collector. An original c-print on fuji crystal paper, face mounted behind 1/4"" acrylic plexiglass with an aluminum dibond backing. These artworks are typically displayed in galleries, starting at $5,000. You will have your choice of cityscape, up to 60""x30"".    ••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••••With the complexity of this project.

<p>My name is Nick Salter, I am a third year student at CU Denver's Digital Design program. This year, they have a 20 day Summer Study Abroad program in Scandanavian Design, in Copenhagen, and I have thrown my hat in the ring to go.</p>
<p>The study abroad program in Copenhagen, a 20 day intensive design course with extensive tours and interviews with top design companies, game companies, architecture companies, etc,  is core to my reason for going, it will be a precious view of a completely integrated approach to design, that will include a field trip to Stockholm Sweden as well. I am also planning on extending my stay, and doing an “Art Tour” of Europe, (depending on funding), via Eurail and staying with friends along the way. My “target” art and European city tour looks like this:</p>
<p>Copenhagen -20 day intensive design classes and workshop</p>
<p>Germany- 4 days visiting a friend of the family and hitting the museums in Berlin. Berlin has major exhibitions with art works from across the ages – starting with masterpieces from the classical and modern world on Museum Island, including the legendary bust of Egyptian Queen Nefertiti.</p>
<p>Romania- My high school art teacher is from there, and she is finding places for me to stay, and recommending various museums there as well. I am also a bit curious of its cultural similarities to Brazil (I come from a bilingual household and my mothers family lives in Brazil).</p>
<p>Istanbul- This is my dream spot, the Hagia Sophia, the Blue Mosque, and more.</p>
<p>Greece- Parthenon, Athens, the birthplace of Western civilization.</p>
<p>Italy- Florence, Rome, Venice, from the classic Roman art and architecture to the flower of the Renaissance.</p>
<p>France-Lyons and Paris, the Louvre, Palais de Versailles.</p>
<p>London- The British Museum, (housing the ""plunder"" of the British Empire), from the Rosetta Stone to exquisite Tibetan Buddhist art.</p>
<p>My project goals are to record, photograph, write and document my trip, from a few perspectives.</p>
<p>As an American student abroad. I worry about the impact of the xenophobic administration on both American and international perspectives. I believe that we have a lot to learn from each other, but this is my moment to bring back some of the best of what I find and share it with my peers and fellow citizens.</p>
<p>As an artist, this trip to Scandinavia will be mostly exploring cutting edge design concepts and work, and ultimately how “design thinking” (the art of solving human problems) works when we work together. On the other hand, I am extending my stay, (a week? A month? A summer?) to see first hand the fruits of Western civilization as reflected in the greatest art and architecture of Europe. I want to find a way to integrate the old, even ancient, and the new, into my creative life.</p>
<p>Its the biggest thing I have ever done in my life, so far.</p>
<p>I plan to not only gather this information, but to create a number of “work products”, ranging from the trivial (but cool!)  t-shirts to an introspective multimedia art journal, and then to create video essays about the places and things I will be seeing!</p>
<p>Obviously very ambitious, which is why I am writing to you! This exchange program and extended trip will not even be possible without outside support. I saved a few thousand by working construction all last summer, along with my work study job and some design gigs, and in fact took the plunge to buy my flight tickets early to save money, and have enough left over to get my Eurail pass. A scary decision, since they are not easily refundable, but I decided to go big and do my best. I found out that the college will grant me at least $1400 toward the $5300 study abroad program, (which does not include travel) but that is not enough. However, I received some scholarships also through the school that cover me up to two thirds of my tuition for Copenhagen!</p>
<p>So I am breaking down my needs into two big buckets. I need to raise/earn at least $1500 to finish the basic cost of the program. That gets me to Europe for the 20 day exchange program. Then, with the Eurail pass in hand, I need a minimum of about $40 a day average room and board to make my way to see the great museums, buildings and art treasures of Europe. Starting at the 10th of June out of Copenhagen, and coming home from London on the 2nd of August, that means about 50 days, times $40-$50 (depending on what part of Europe), or about $2000 minimum if I am frugal and lucky.</p>
<p>I am both already, as we have people willing to put me up in Germany (2) Romania (2) Greece (1), Austria (2), Italy (3), France (2) and London (1), with possibilities in Hungary and looking for help in Istanbul.</p>
<p>So, I am launching this IndieGoGo crowdfunding campaign to help with those expenses. I may have to cut the travel back a bit, or dramatically, but I am hopeful that I can take full advantage of this once in a lifetime opportunity to experience both the best of cutting edge modern design and drink up the ancient and classical art of the ages.</p>
<p>As ambitious as this seems, I am hopeful that you can help me, even with just $20 or $40 dollars, the cost of a meal, or a day's room and board, and I can put together enough to live this dream fully and creatively. Still looking for more friends and family to stay with in Europe, (and I need a really good back pack), so if you know of other ways you can help, I am all ears.</p>
<p>I want all of you to feel like you are going on this journey with me, so as part of that will be committed to giving back various “perks”. I thought about these as “what would I like if one of my friends went and I wanted to support them?” while still following my strengths of digital and analog art.</p>
<p>So, for those that choose to support this wild quest, I will be creating the following items for my patrons, large and small.</p>
<p>A Recipe and Food Ebook- OK, part of this journey is cultural, and what is more cultural than food? I will gather recipes where I can, take in-context pics of the people and food I discover, and include a few things I try that I cannot get the recipes for, but that you should know about when you go. More like an eBook.</p>
<p>A physical Food and Recipe calendar of the above!</p>
<p>An Art Tour Ebook- I am creating a printed Art Tour Calendar for my $100 patrons to hang on the wall. For this perk, a digital version of that in the form of an Ebook, with 12 of the best art images I capture on my journey through Europe's greatest museums, churches and relics. This will include some personal reflections and facts about the images.</p>
<p>The physical calendar from these images. The Hagia Sophia and Bernini’s David amongst the must see exhibits I hope to capture on film and in sketches.</p>
<p>T-Shirts designed by me- I have designed multiple t-shirts for my church group in the past, they can choose that or one that I will be personally designing from my experience there, as a thank you. (I expect to be quite inspired by the design school projects!)</p>
<p>My Art Journey Ebook- This Ebook will include some of the art, recipes, personal stories, and some video of my Art Tour. This will be the closest to going on the journey with me, with lots of extras, miscellaneous digital versions of my sketches, silliness, learning and stories. Think of it as a multimedia scrapbook, but with a thread and a journey to tell a tale.</p>
<p>I will make a personal sketch of some of the artwork/architecture pieces I will be seeing. I will choose together with my patrons the piece of work before I go so that I am sure to see it live. This will be an original, signed, one of a kind, though I request the digital rights to it.</p>
<p>I am going to create video essays. I will be posting them online for the public as well as trying to get other people to take the leap and study abroad. I will share a “post-mortem”, the good, the bad, and the ugly of the whole process, fundraising, travel and results, so it can help others stretch as well.</p>
<p>I hesitated to put this out there, as this campaign is not for a cure for cancer, or some other noble cause. It is simply to support one artist's thirst to learn, a kind of art pilgrimage or walkabout. For those of you who do not even know me, I cannot fathom what might move you to support me, so I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Will it change the world? Unlikely. Will it change my life and perspective for the better? Absolutely. Will you enjoy coming along for the ride? I sure hope so. Please share this, and I am wide open to more ideas for artwork, food, locations, and people to meet on this journey.</p>

This will be the closest to going on the journey with me, with lots of extras, miscellaneous digital versions of my sketches, silliness, learning and stories. Think of it as a multimedia scrapbook, but with a thread and a journey to tell a tale.
I will make a personal sketch of some of the artwork/architecture pieces I will be seeing. I will choose together with my patrons the piece of work before I go so that I am sure to see it live. This will be an original, signed, one of a kind, though I request the digital rights to it.
I am going to create video essays. I will be posting them online for the public as well as trying to get other people to take the leap and study abroad. I will share a “post-mortem”, the good, the bad, and the ugly of the whole process, fundraising, travel and results, so it can help others stretch as well.
I hesitated to put this out there, as this campaign is not for a cure for cancer, or some other noble cause. It is simply to support one artist's thirst to learn, a kind of art pilgrimage or walkabout. For those of you who do not even know me, I cannot fathom what might move you to support me, so I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Will it change the world? Unlikely. Will it change my life and perspective for the better? Absolutely. Will you enjoy coming along for the ride? I sure hope so. Please share this, and I am wide open to more ideas for artwork, food, locations, and people to meet on this journey.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p><i>(Une version française apparaît après la version anglaise).</i></p>
<p><strong>Who I am</strong></p>
<p>Hello. My name is <strong>Natali Leduc</strong>. I build interactive sculptures, I do performances and experimental puppet shows. You can view two of my previous projects here:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>The Churnatron 1400, a two-story bicycle for 4 riders that churns ice cream: </i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58mtlkLWpCI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58mtlkLWpCI</a>

</li>
</ul>
<p>I am a founding member of the <strong>American Consumer Consortium</strong>, a group of artists with a sense of humor. We are interested in the way people interact within society, with objects, and with the environment.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Project</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>Jokeatron 5200</strong> is an interactive large-scale sculpture (12ft tall x 24ft diameter). It’s a banana peel made out of steel that a prankster robot threw on the ground. Inside the Jokeatron 5200, you can record a joke of your choice, which gets broadcast around the sculpture. All jokes are followed by prerecorded laughs.</p>
<p>This is my <strong>most ambitious</strong> project so far. I am very excited, and I hope that it will lead me to more challenging projects.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528773173/wzbevfykopi6hq0jhx7k.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527872269/vczssgz0jcdmavsvjwlw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As a <strong>contributor</strong>, you will help me and my team to achieve a beautiful, sturdy, safe and fun interactive large-scale sculpture that thousands of people will enjoy... maybe even yourself! It will be shown at <strong>Burning Man 2018</strong>, and, if everything goes according to the plan, the central section of the Jokeatron 5200 will be previewed at the <strong>Festival de la francophonie</strong> in Victoria, BC, Canada (June 23-24, 2018). I am looking for more venues beyond Burning Man, so who knows? The Jokeatron 5200 might come to your town...</p>
<p>By contributing, you will also help sending to Burning Man the only <strong>Canadian</strong> project that was awarded an honorarium grant from Burning Man this year.</p>

<h3>En bref</h3>
<p><strong>Qui je suis</strong></p>
<p>Bonjour. Je m'appelle <strong>Natali Leduc</strong>. Je fais des sculptures interactives, des performances et des spectacles de marionnettes expérimentaux. Vous pouvez voir deux de mes réalisations ici:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<i>Le Churnatron 1400, une bicyclette à deux étages pour quatre cyclistes qui fait de la crème glacée</i><i>: </i><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58mtlkLWpCI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58mtlkLWpCI</a>
</li>

<i>Le Tunatron 2000.03, un orgue à bouteilles mobile:</i> <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHG05IXIuMs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHG05IXIuMs</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Je suis co-fondatrice de l'<strong>American Consumer Consortium</strong>, un groupe d'artistes avec un sens de l'humour. Nous nous intéressons à la façon dont les gens agissent en société et à leur façon d'interagir avec les objets et l'environnement.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Le projet</strong></p>
<p>Le <strong>Jokeatron 5200 </strong>est une sculpture géante interactive en acier (12’ de haut x 24’ de diamètre) qui représente une peau de banane qu’un robot farceur aurait jetée sur le sol. Le Jokeatron 5200 se veut un point de rencontre pour l’humour de tous les horizons. Les participants sont invités à entrer dans la partie centrale du Jokeatron 5200 et à y enregistrer une blague de leur choix, qui est ensuite diffusée autour de la sculpture. Toutes les blagues sont suivies de rires pré-enregistrés.</p>
<p>C'est mon projet <strong>le plus ambitieux </strong>à ce jour. Je suis très contente d'avoir la chance de le réaliser et j'espère qu'il mènera à d'autres défis encore plus grands.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528773173/wzbevfykopi6hq0jhx7k.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1527872269/vczssgz0jcdmavsvjwlw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>En tant que <strong>contributeur</strong>, vous m'aiderez ainsi que mon équipe à réaliser une sculpture géante, belle, sécuritaire, robuste et amusante dont profiteront des milliers de personnes... peut-être même vous! Le Jokeatron 5200 sera présenté à <strong>Burning Man en 2018</strong>, et, si tout va comme prévu, la section centrale du Jokeatron 5200 fera une avant-première au <strong>Festival de la francophonie</strong> à Victoria, en Colombie-Britannique (les 23 et 24 juin). Je cherche d'autres occasions de l'exposer au-delà de Burning Man. Alors qui sait? Peut-être que le Jokeatron 5200 viendra près de chez vous...</p>
<p>En contribuant, vous aiderez également à envoyer à Burning Man le seul projet <strong>canadien</strong> à avoir reçu une subvention de Burning Man cette année.</p>

The Tunatron 2000.03, a mobile bottle organ: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHG05IXIuMs


I am a founding member of the American Consumer Consortium, a group of artists with a sense of humor. We are interested in the way people interact within society, with objects, and with the environment.
 
The Project
The Jokeatron 5200 is an interactive large-scale sculpture (12ft tall x 24ft diameter). It’s a banana peel made out of steel that a prankster robot threw on the ground. Inside the Jokeatron 5200, you can record a joke of your choice, which gets broadcast around the sculpture. All jokes are followed by prerecorded laughs.
This is my most ambitious project so far. I am very excited, and I hope that it will lead me to more challenging projects.

As a contributor, you will help me and my team to achieve a beautiful, sturdy, safe and fun interactive large-scale sculpture that thousands of people will enjoy... maybe even yourself! It will be shown at Burning Man 2018, and, if everything goes according to the plan, the central section of the Jokeatron 5200 will be previewed at the Festival de la francophonie in Victoria, BC, Canada (June 23-24, 2018). I am looking for more venues beyond Burning Man, so who knows? The Jokeatron 5200 might come to your town...
By contributing, you will also help sending to Burning Man the only Canadian project that was awarded an honorarium grant from Burning Man this year.

En bref
Qui je suis
Bonjour. Je m'appelle Natali Leduc. Je fais des sculptures interactives, des performances et des spectacles de marionnettes expérimentaux. Vous pouvez voir deux de mes réalisations ici:


Le Churnatron 1400, une bicyclette à deux étages pour quatre cyclistes qui fait de la crème glacée: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58mtlkLWpCI


Le Tunatron 2000.03, un orgue à bouteilles mobile: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHG05IXIuMs


Je suis co-fondatrice de l'American Consumer Consortium, un groupe d'artistes avec un sens de l'humour. Nous nous intéressons à la façon dont les gens agissent en société et à leur façon d'interagir avec les objets et l'environnement.
 
Le projet
Le Jokeatron 5200 est une sculpture géante interactive en acier (12’ de haut x 24’ de diamètre) qui représente une peau de banane qu’un robot farceur aurait jetée sur le sol. Le Jokeatron 5200 se veut un point de rencontre pour l’humour de tous les horizons. Les participants sont invités à entrer dans la partie centrale du Jokeatron 5200 et à y enregistrer une blague de leur choix, qui est ensuite diffusée autour de la sculpture. Toutes les blagues sont suivies de rires pré-enregistrés.
C'est mon projet le plus ambitieux à ce jour. Je suis très contente d'avoir la chance de le réaliser et j'espère qu'il mènera à d'autres défis encore plus grands.

En tant que contributeur, vous m'aiderez ainsi que mon équipe à réaliser une sculpture géante, belle, sécuritaire, robuste et amusante dont profiteront des milliers de personnes... peut-être même vous! Le Jokeatron 5200 sera présenté à Burning Man en 2018, et, si tout va comme prévu, la section centrale du Jokeatron 5200 fera une avant-première au Festival de la francophonie à Victoria, en Colombie-Britannique (les 23 et 24 juin). Je cherche d'autres occasions de l'exposer au-delà de Burning Man. Alors qui sait? Peut-être que le Jokeatron 5200 viendra près de chez vous...
En contribuant, vous aiderez également à envoyer à Burning Man le seul projet canadien à avoir reçu une subvention de Burning Man cette année.

<p>In 2018, Digital Dalang became the first Indonesian art project to be awarded funding from Burning Man. The interactive art installation combines traditional wayang kulit shadow puppetry with motion reactive projection mapping. Digital Dalang was handpicked by the festival’s founder, Larry Harvey, to receive an Honoraria Art Grant and he shortlisted the project as one he was most excited to see. Sadly, due to his untimely passing, Larry never got to see the project in action when they debuted Burning Man iRobot to much appraise.

Digital Dalang was recently invited to be partially funded to perform in Nevada City and any additional funds received from this campaign will be used to realize this tour. The campaign’s stretch goal of $7,500 will not only be sufficient to save the project but also support a self financed return to Burning Man this year.</p> <p>In addition to the authentic Indonesian memorabilia the project gifted to donors last year, this campaign will also be offering new unique perks.

<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What is this project about and why do we need you</strong></h3>
<p><i>Big Snake Ziggzagging in Me</i> is a multi-disciplinary art project that creates immersive, online and live art experiences. It is co-created by photographer and Shaman Dhan Ribeiro (Brazil), actress and performance artist Kyara Orlando (Brazil, UK) and artist, performer and curator Katerina Barampouti (Greece, UK). We joined forces to decisively tell a story: how powerful we, as humans, can be when we allow enchantment into our lives; when we attune to our sacredness and consciousness. So, we want to give you a taste of that.</p>
<p>We offer an experience that reflects upon how we relate to the environment, the elements of nature and to ourselves. Through a photographic narrative by Dhan Ribeiro, a solo performance by Kyara Orlando and related art events (workshops, Q&amp;A, discussions, short performances) directed and curated by Katerina Barampouti. <i>Big Snake Ziggzagging in Me</i> evokes the enchantment and mysteries of our world. This project suggests a creative relationship with life, it refers to the myth of the Great Cobra (Cobra Grande) that permeates the Amazonian territory which represents the fertile life force that we carry within our DNA and that is perpetually creating and connecting all beings.</p>
<p><strong>Have a look at our virtual exhibition with some of Dhan's photographs:</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href=""https://www.artsteps.com/view/607c9ca3fd9455a4fd6b9da1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.artsteps.com/view/607c9ca3fd9455a4fd6b9da1</a></strong></p>
<p>This project was launched online on 12th November 2020 with an online performance, Q&amp;A and a short workshop. A virtual exhibition is currently taking place, which you can access on the link above. The photography exhibition that includes live performances will take place in London at The Koppel Project Hive Gallery from July 2021 (until 6 August 2021).</p>
<p>This is where we need your help, to manifest the aforementioned exhibition. The Koppel Project is generously supporting us with an exhibition space in the heart of London (<a href=""http://www.thekoppelproject.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.thekoppelproject.com</a>) and by producing and managing the project. Your financial support will fund: materials, installation equipments, digital equipment, high quality prints for the exhibition, props for the performance, documenting and marketing costs. </p>
<p>Help us spread the word, trusting in the power of art to inspire, educate and challenge human perception. Expressed through visuals, sounds, movement, storytelling, environmental art-ivism and shamanism. You can can be part of this!</p>
<p>Lastly, we look forward to seeing you at our live exhibition and/or virtual events.</p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our </span>deepest<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> gratitude.</span></p>
<h3><strong><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: 700;letter-spacing: 0px;"">What we need &amp; what you get</span></strong></h3>
<div>
<div>In essence, funds will go to:</div>
<div> </div>
<ul>
<li>70% Production costs in the UK including all materials (i.e. paper, clips, nails, stands), high quality prints, audio-visual equipments, technical requirements and insurance. </li>
<li>20% Artists/performers travel, prep and rehearsals expenses.</li>
<li>10% Admin &amp; marketing.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the campaign exceeds its goal, then any additional fund will go towards the artist's out-of-pocket expenses. Additional funds will also be donated to the Terra Mirim Foundation, which is the shamanic community where the photos of this exhibition where taken. Terra Mirim is located in Bahia-Brazil, in a preserved area of the Atlantic Forest and depends on donations like this to continue its tireless work of receiving people from all over the world who are seeking healing and a life path of communion and co-creation with nature.</p>
<p>If the campaign does not reach its full goal, it will still be of great help as any amount will subsidise part of the costs. No donation is too small, we are extremely grateful for your collaboration and support. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><strong>Perks!</strong></h3>
<p>To show our gratitude we've prepared various perk for you - including the opportunity to experience this project first hand. Here's a list of some perks we are offering:</p>
<p>1) A ticket to see Kyara Orlando's live private-view performance in London, in July 2021. </p>
<p>2) A place to participate in Kyara Orlando's <i>Four Elements Creative Flow</i> workshop either online (June) or in person in London (July). </p>
<p>3) A place to participate in Katerina Barampouti's <i>Creative Mindfulness </i>workshop either online (August) or in person in London (July).</p>
<p>4) A high-quality print of one of Dhan Ribeiro's photographs, 3 different sizes available.</p>
<p>5) An A5 photographic booklet of the exhibition and A6 postcards of the photos .</p>
</div>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; challenges</strong></h3>
<p>We trust and hope that everyone will be in good health. Considering the current worldwide crisis and any unforeseen events, we are determined to make this project happen and share a truly meaningful and constructive experience with our audience. We are flexible and able to reschedule the exhibition and presentation dates and to do additional virtual events.</p>
<p>We have been putting together art events for more than two decades. We aim to use sustainable, fair trade material. </p>
<h3><strong>Project description - the myth and the experience</strong></h3>
<p>The myth of the 'Great Cobra' ('Cobra Grande' in Portuguese) permeates the Amazonian territory. Its presence is felt along the great rivers and the wide and open expanses of the Brazilian savannas. The story of an ancient cosmic presence in the form of a feathered snake, also known as 'The Enchanted One' or 'Caianinha', is passed down from genaration to genaration through storytelling by the indigenous people of the forest. The myth of an enchanted snake that brings life to this planet and to humans, weave into our playful and sacred imagination. Metaphorically, we are born from the womb of 'Mother Earth' ('Pachamama') as we all carry within us the same seed that reflects our oneness with everything and the great diversity and abundance of this planet. </p>
<p>The 'Cobra Grande - Big Snake Ziggzagging in Me' photograpy exhibition shares the essence of the 'Cobra Grande' myth. It's about the creature that zigzags along the banks of the river, fertilising itself and the riverside dwellers who watch it flow towards the great cosmic ocean. It is an attempt to depict and reveal the matrimonial dance of 'Cobra Grande' who becomes empregnated through the fertility that emanates from the Magical Kingdom of the Enchanted People of the Forest.</p>
<p>Performing actress Kyara Orlando expressed the mythical relationship between the visible and the invisible, embodying the spirit of the 'Enchanted Serpent' through a shamanic performance in the dark waters of the Itamboatá river. Photographer and Shaman Dhan Ribeiro documented this process creating a visual record that resulted in a narrative composted of 45 coloured photographs. The first rays of sunshine that bathed the space with a golden light generated depth and contrast in the images, thus enabling the narrative to develop within a beautiful concept of pure magical realism. Supported by a soundscape of tribal songs and sounds of the forest, this exhibition invites the viewer to immerse in the ancestral space of the people of the forest. </p>
<p>​Katerina Barampouti will curate a sacred space for Kyara Orlando and Dhan Ribeiro to deliver the Cobra Grande mythical experience. She will also invite other creatives and thinkers to exchange views on the subject and share practices and knowledge.</p>

<h3><strong>Sobre o que é esse projeto e porque precisamos de você</strong></h3>
<p><i>Cobra Grande Ziguezagueando em Mim</i> é um projeto artístico multidisciplinar que cria experiências artísticas imersivas, presenciais e online. É uma co-criação entre o fotógrafo e xamã Dhan Ribeiro (Brasil), a atriz e performer Kyara Orlando (Brasil, Reino Unido) e a artista, performer e curadora Katerina Barampouti (Grécia, Reino Unido). Juntamos forças para contar uma história de forma decisiva: como nós, humanos, podemos nos tornar mais fortes se abrimos espaço para o encantamento em nossas vidas; quando estamos conscientes e sintonizados com nossa própria sacralidade. Então, queremos lhe proporcionar um gostinho disso.</p>
<p>Oferecemos uma experiência que reflete sobre como nos relacionamos com o meio ambiente, os elementos da natureza e com nós mesmos. Através de uma narrativa fotográfica de Dhan Ribeiro, uma performance solo de Kyara Orlando e eventos artísticos (workshops, painel de conversas, debates, performances curtas) com direção e curadoria de Katerina Barampouti. <i>Cobra Grande Ziguezagueando em Mim</i> evoca o encantamento e os mistérios do nosso mundo. Esse projeto sugere uma relação criativa com a vida, tendo como referência o mito da Cobra Grande que permeia o território Amazônico e representa a força vital fértil que carregamos em nosso DNA e que está perpetualmente criando e conectando todos os seres.</p>
<p><strong>Veja a nossa exposição virtual com algumas das fotografias de Dhan:</strong></p>

<h3><strong>Riscos e desafios</strong></h3>

Somos flexíveis e capazes de remarcar a performance-exposição e realizar novos eventos virtuais. </p>
<p>Temos organizado eventos artísticos por mais de duas décadas. Nosso objetivo é usar materiais de comércio justo e sustentável. </p>
<h3><strong>Descrição do Projeto – o mito e a experiência</strong></h3>
<p>O mito da ""Cobra Grande"" permeia o território Amazônico. Sua presença é sentida nos grandes rios e nas vastas extensões das savanas brasileiras. A história de uma presença cósmica milenar em forma de uma serpente emplumada, também conhecida como “A Encantada’ ou ‘Caianinha’, é passada de geração em geração pelos diversos povos da floresta. O mito de uma serpente encantada que trás vida a esse planeta, é tecido no nosso imaginário lúdico e sagrado. Metaforicamente, nós nascemos do útero da Mãe Terra (Pachamama) pois carregamos dentre de nós a mesma semente que reflete nossa união com tudo e ao mesmo tempo a grande diversidade e abundância desse planeta. </p>
<p>A exposição fotográfica <i>Cobra Grande Ziguezagueando em Mim</i>  compartilha a essência do mito da ""Cobra Grande"". Trata-se de uma criatura que ziguezagueia pelas margens do rio, fertilizando a se própria e aos ribeirinhos que a vêem passar fluindo em direção ao grande oceano cósmico. É uma tentativa de retratar e revelar a dança matrimonial da ‘Cobra Grande’ que se torna grávida através da fertilidade que emana do Reino Mágico do Povo Encantado da Floresta.</p>
<p>A atriz e performer Kyara Orlando expressou o relacionamento mítico entre o visível e o invisível, incorporando o espírito da ‘Serpente Encantada’ através de uma performance xamânica nas águas escuras do Rio Itamboatá. O fotógrafo e Xamã Dhan Ribeiro documentou esse processo criando uma registro visual que resultou numa narrativa fotográfica composta por 45 fotografias coloridas. Os primeiros raios de sol que banharam o espaço com uma luz dourada geraram profundidade e contraste nas imagens, permitindo assim que a narrativa se desenvolvesse dentro de um belo conceito de puro realismo mágico. Apoiada por uma paisagem sonora de canções tribais e sons da floresta, esta exposição convida o espectador a mergulhar no espaço ancestral do povo da floresta.</p>
<p>Katerina Barampouti será a curadora de um espaço sagrado para que Kyara Orlando e Dhan Ribeiro possam realizar a experiência mítica Cobra Grande. Ela também vai convidar outros artistas e pensadores para trocar impressões sobre o assunto e compartilhar práticas e conhecimentos.</p>

<h3><strong>Worum geht es in diesem Projekt und warum brauchen wir dich?</strong></h3>
<p>Das Projekt Big Snake Ziggzagging in Me ist eine Entdeckungsreise, die durch Online- und Live-Kunst-Erlebnisse, die alle Sinne umfassen, ausgedrückt wird. Es wird gemeinsam von dem Fotografen, Künstler und Schamanen Dhan Ribeiro (Brasilien), der Schauspielerin und Performance-Künstlerin Kyara Orlando (Brasilien, Großbritannien) und der Künstlerin, Performerin und Kuratorin Katerina Barampouti (Griechenland, Großbritannien) gestaltet. Wir haben uns zusammengetan, um eine Geschichte zu erzählen: wie mächtig Menschen sind, wenn wir uns verzaubern lassen; wenn wir in Kontakt mit unserer Heiligkeit und unserem Bewusstsein sind. Davon wollen wir dir eine Kostprobe geben.</p>
<p>Lasst uns erleben und überprüfen, wie wir Menschen uns zu den Elementen der Natur, zur Umwelt und zu uns selbst verhalten. Durch Performances von Kyara Orlando, eine fotografische Erzählung von Dhan Ribeiro und damit verbundene Kunstaktionen, die von Katerina Barampouti geleitet und kuratiert werden, beschwört Big Snake Ziggzagging in Me den Zauber unserer physischen Welt herauf und legt eine kreative Beziehung zu all den existenziellen Dynamiken, die unseren Planeten so besonders machen, nahe. Das Projekt verwendet den Mythos der Großen Kobra (Cobra Grande) als Bezugspunkt: Dieser Mythos durchdringt das Gebiet des Amazonas und spricht von der fruchtbaren Lebenskraft, die ständig die Welt erschafft - und die wir in unserer DNA tragen.</p>
<p><strong>Wirf einen Blick auf unsere virtuelle Ausstellung mit einigen von Dhan's besten Fotografien:</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://www.artsteps.com/view/607c9ca3fd9455a4fd6b9da1"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>https://www.artsteps.com/view/607c9ca3fd9455a4fd6b9da1</strong></a></p>
<p>Dieses Projekt wurde am 12. November 2020 online mit einer Diskussionsrunde, einem Mini-Workshop und einer Online-Performance gestartet. Eine virtuelle Ausstellung findet derzeit statt und eine physische Fotografie- und Kunstausstellung zusammen mit einer Reihe an Live-Workshops wird im Juli 2021 in der Galerie The Koppel Project Hive in London stattfinden (5. Juli bis 6. August 2021).</p>
<p>An dieser Stelle brauchen wir deine Hilfe bei der Realisierung der physischen Ausstellung. The Koppel Project unterstützt uns großzügig mit einem erstaunlichen, gut ausgestatteten Raum im Herzen Londons (<a href=""http://www.thekoppelproject.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.thekoppelproject.com</a>) und mit der Produktion und dem Management des Projekts. Deine individuelle Unterstützung wird uns ermöglichen, die Anforderungen an die Ausstellungsinstallation an das Aufführungsmaterial zu erfüllen, qualitativ hochwertige Fotos zu drucken und auch die Veranstaltungen zu dokumentieren und zu vermarkten. </p>
<p>Leitet das Projekt weiter, im Vertrauen auf die Fähigkeit der Kunst, die menschliche Wahrnehmung zu inspirieren, zu erziehen und zu bewegen. Ausgedrückt durch Bilder, Klänge, gesprochenes Wort, Umweltaktivismus, Schamanismus und die Kraft des Geschichtenerzählens. Du kannst dazu beitragen!</p>
<p>Und vor allem hoffen wir darauf, dich während unserer physischen Ausstellung und/oder unserer virtuellen Veranstaltungen zu sehen!</p>
<p>Unsere tiefste Dankbarkeit.</p>
<h3> </h3>

Terra Mirim befindet sich in Bahia, Brasilien, in einem Schutzgebiet des Atlantischen Waldes, und ist auf Spenden wie diese angewiesen, um seine unermüdliche Arbeit fortzusetzen und Menschen aus der ganzen Welt zu empfangen, die Heilung und einen Lebensweg in Gemeinschaft und Ko-Kreation mit der Natur suchen.</p>

Wir sind flexibel und in der Lage, die Präsentationstermine zu verschieben und auch mehr virtuelle Veranstaltungen durchzuführen.</p>
<p>Wir stellen seit mehr als zwei Jahrzehnten komplexe Veranstaltungen zusammen und sind zuversichtlich, dass wir auch diese Veranstaltung reibungslos organisieren können. Wir halten, was wir versprechen, und verwenden umweltfreundliche, fair gehandelte Materialien. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Projektbeschreibung - Der Mythos und das Erlebnis:</strong></h3>
<p>Der Mythos der ""Großen Kobra"" (""Cobra Grande"" auf Lateinisch) durchdringt das Gebiet des Amazonas. Ihre Präsenz ist entlang der großen Flüsse ebenso zu spüren wie in den weiten und offenen Flächen der brasilianischen Savannen. Eine uralte Präsenz - die auch als 'die Verzauberte' oder 'Caianinha' bekannt ist - wird in den Rädern der Geschichten bewahrt, die von den verschiedenen Waldvölkern erzählt werden und die uns durch deren Weitergabe geschenkt wurden und sich in unsere spielerische und heilige Vorstellungskraft einweben. Obwohl wir nicht direkt aus dem Schoß der 'Mutter des Waldes' ('Madre Floresta') stammen, tragen wir die Gene der Vielfalt und des Überflusses in uns. Ein fruchtbarer Zustand der Verzauberung, der uns oft durch die vier Ecken dieses Kontinents führt.</p>
<p>Die Fotoausstellung 'Cobra Grande - Big Snake Ziggzagging in Me' teilt die Essenz der 'Cobra Grande'-Geschichte und erschafft den Mythos durch Aktionen und Bilder neu. Sie erzählt von der Kreatur, die im Zickzack an den Ufern des Flusses entlangläuft und sich selbst befruchtet, und von den Bewohnern des Flusses, die sie vom Schatten des Waldes aus auf ihrer Suche nach dem kosmischen Ozean beobachten. Es ist ein Versuch, den Ehetanz der 'Cobra Grande' darzustellen und zu enthüllen, die von der Fruchtbarkeit, die vom magischen Königreich der verzauberten Menschen des Waldes ausgeht, schwanger wird. Die Schauspielerin Kyara Orlando bringt die mythische Beziehung zwischen der Sichtbarkeit und Unsichtbarkeit der Welt zum Ausdruck und verkörpert den Geist der 'Verzauberten Schlange' durch eine schamanische Performance in den dunklen Gewässern des Flusses Itamboatá, während der Fotograf und Schamane Dhan Ribeiro den Prozess in einer fotografischen Erzählung aus 45 Farbfotografien dokumentiert. Diese Fotografien versuchen, den Betrachter in den angestammten Raum der Menschen des Waldes eintauchen zu lassen; umgeben von Stammesgesängen, 'Icaros' und Klängen des Waldes - und eine visuelle Aufzeichnung der expressiven Entfaltung zu schaffen, die jedem Moment vor der Kamera folgte. Inmitten der Vegetation tauchten die ersten Sonnenstrahlen den Raum in ein goldenes Licht und erzeugten Tiefe, Kontrast und Volumen in den Bildern, welche am Morgen des 6. Januar 2019 aufgenommen wurden. Die gesamte Arbeit wurde innerhalb<strong> </strong>der Szenerie ausgeführt, die die Natur selbst geschaffen hat, und ermöglichte so die Entwicklung der Geschichte innerhalb eines schönen Konzepts des reinen magischen Realismus: wo Realität und Magie unsere spielerische Fähigkeit inspirieren, sich vollständig dem Ausdruck zu öffnen.</p>
<p>Katerina Barampouti kuratiert einen heiligen Raum für Kyara Orlando und Dhan Ribeiro, um die mythische Erfahrung der Cobra Grande zu gewährleisten und bringt darüber hinaus verschiedene Kreative und Denker zusammen, damit diese sich austauschen und Praktiken und Wissen zu teilen. </p>

What is this project about and why do we need you
Big Snake Ziggzagging in Me is a multi-disciplinary art project that creates immersive, online and live art experiences. It is co-created by photographer and Shaman Dhan Ribeiro (Brazil), actress and performance artist Kyara Orlando (Brazil, UK) and artist, performer and curator Katerina Barampouti (Greece, UK). We joined forces to decisively tell a story: how powerful we, as humans, can be when we allow enchantment into our lives; when we attune to our sacredness and consciousness. So, we want to give you a taste of that.
We offer an experience that reflects upon how we relate to the environment, the elements of nature and to ourselves. Through a photographic narrative by Dhan Ribeiro, a solo performance by Kyara Orlando and related art events (workshops, Q&A, discussions, short performances) directed and curated by Katerina Barampouti. Big Snake Ziggzagging in Me evokes the enchantment and mysteries of our world. This project suggests a creative relationship with life, it refers to the myth of the Great Cobra (Cobra Grande) that permeates the Amazonian territory which represents the fertile life force that we carry within our DNA and that is perpetually creating and connecting all beings.
Have a look at our virtual exhibition with some of Dhan's photographs:
https://www.artsteps.com/view/607c9ca3fd9455a4fd6b9da1
This project was launched online on 12th November 2020 with an online performance, Q&A and a short workshop. A virtual exhibition is currently taking place, which you can access on the link above. The photography exhibition that includes live performances will take place in London at The Koppel Project Hive Gallery from July 2021 (until 6 August 2021).
This is where we need your help, to manifest the aforementioned exhibition. The Koppel Project is generously supporting us with an exhibition space in the heart of London (www.thekoppelproject.com) and by producing and managing the project. Your financial support will fund: materials, installation equipments, digital equipment, high quality prints for the exhibition, props for the performance, documenting and marketing costs. 
Help us spread the word, trusting in the power of art to inspire, educate and challenge human perception. Expressed through visuals, sounds, movement, storytelling, environmental art-ivism and shamanism. You can can be part of this!
Lastly, we look forward to seeing you at our live exhibition and/or virtual events.
Our deepest gratitude.
What we need & what you get

In essence, funds will go to:
 

70% Production costs in the UK including all materials (i.e. paper, clips, nails, stands), high quality prints, audio-visual equipments, technical requirements and insurance. 
20% Artists/performers travel, prep and rehearsals expenses.
10% Admin & marketing.

If the campaign exceeds its goal, then any additional fund will go towards the artist's out-of-pocket expenses. Additional funds will also be donated to the Terra Mirim Foundation, which is the shamanic community where the photos of this exhibition where taken. Terra Mirim is located in Bahia-Brazil, in a preserved area of the Atlantic Forest and depends on donations like this to continue its tireless work of receiving people from all over the world who are seeking healing and a life path of communion and co-creation with nature.
If the campaign does not reach its full goal, it will still be of great help as any amount will subsidise part of the costs. No donation is too small, we are extremely grateful for your collaboration and support.

We have been putting together art events for more than two decades. We aim to use sustainable, fair trade material. 
Project description - the myth and the experience
The myth of the 'Great Cobra' ('Cobra Grande' in Portuguese) permeates the Amazonian territory. Its presence is felt along the great rivers and the wide and open expanses of the Brazilian savannas. The story of an ancient cosmic presence in the form of a feathered snake, also known as 'The Enchanted One' or 'Caianinha', is passed down from genaration to genaration through storytelling by the indigenous people of the forest. The myth of an enchanted snake that brings life to this planet and to humans, weave into our playful and sacred imagination. Metaphorically, we are born from the womb of 'Mother Earth' ('Pachamama') as we all carry within us the same seed that reflects our oneness with everything and the great diversity and abundance of this planet. 
The 'Cobra Grande - Big Snake Ziggzagging in Me' photograpy exhibition shares the essence of the 'Cobra Grande' myth. It's about the creature that zigzags along the banks of the river, fertilising itself and the riverside dwellers who watch it flow towards the great cosmic ocean. It is an attempt to depict and reveal the matrimonial dance of 'Cobra Grande' who becomes empregnated through the fertility that emanates from the Magical Kingdom of the Enchanted People of the Forest.
Performing actress Kyara Orlando expressed the mythical relationship between the visible and the invisible, embodying the spirit of the 'Enchanted Serpent' through a shamanic performance in the dark waters of the Itamboatá river. Photographer and Shaman Dhan Ribeiro documented this process creating a visual record that resulted in a narrative composted of 45 coloured photographs. The first rays of sunshine that bathed the space with a golden light generated depth and contrast in the images, thus enabling the narrative to develop within a beautiful concept of pure magical realism. Supported by a soundscape of tribal songs and sounds of the forest, this exhibition invites the viewer to immerse in the ancestral space of the people of the forest. 
​Katerina Barampouti will curate a sacred space for Kyara Orlando and Dhan Ribeiro to deliver the Cobra Grande mythical experience. She will also invite other creatives and thinkers to exchange views on the subject and share practices and knowledge.

Temos organizado eventos artísticos por mais de duas décadas. Nosso objetivo é usar materiais de comércio justo e sustentável. 
Descrição do Projeto – o mito e a experiência
O mito da ""Cobra Grande"" permeia o território Amazônico. Sua presença é sentida nos grandes rios e nas vastas extensões das savanas brasileiras. A história de uma presença cósmica milenar em forma de uma serpente emplumada, também conhecida como “A Encantada’ ou ‘Caianinha’, é passada de geração em geração pelos diversos povos da floresta. O mito de uma serpente encantada que trás vida a esse planeta, é tecido no nosso imaginário lúdico e sagrado. Metaforicamente, nós nascemos do útero da Mãe Terra (Pachamama) pois carregamos dentre de nós a mesma semente que reflete nossa união com tudo e ao mesmo tempo a grande diversidade e abundância desse planeta. 
A exposição fotográfica Cobra Grande Ziguezagueando em Mim  compartilha a essência do mito da ""Cobra Grande"". Trata-se de uma criatura que ziguezagueia pelas margens do rio, fertilizando a se própria e aos ribeirinhos que a vêem passar fluindo em direção ao grande oceano cósmico. É uma tentativa de retratar e revelar a dança matrimonial da ‘Cobra Grande’ que se torna grávida através da fertilidade que emana do Reino Mágico do Povo Encantado da Floresta.
A atriz e performer Kyara Orlando expressou o relacionamento mítico entre o visível e o invisível, incorporando o espírito da ‘Serpente Encantada’ através de uma performance xamânica nas águas escuras do Rio Itamboatá. O fotógrafo e Xamã Dhan Ribeiro documentou esse processo criando uma registro visual que resultou numa narrativa fotográfica composta por 45 fotografias coloridas. Os primeiros raios de sol que banharam o espaço com uma luz dourada geraram profundidade e contraste nas imagens, permitindo assim que a narrativa se desenvolvesse dentro de um belo conceito de puro realismo mágico. Apoiada por uma paisagem sonora de canções tribais e sons da floresta, esta exposição convida o espectador a mergulhar no espaço ancestral do povo da floresta.
Katerina Barampouti será a curadora de um espaço sagrado para que Kyara Orlando e Dhan Ribeiro possam realizar a experiência mítica Cobra Grande. Ela também vai convidar outros artistas e pensadores para trocar impressões sobre o assunto e compartilhar práticas e conhecimentos.

Worum geht es in diesem Projekt und warum brauchen wir dich?
Das Projekt Big Snake Ziggzagging in Me ist eine Entdeckungsreise, die durch Online- und Live-Kunst-Erlebnisse, die alle Sinne umfassen, ausgedrückt wird. Es wird gemeinsam von dem Fotografen, Künstler und Schamanen Dhan Ribeiro (Brasilien), der Schauspielerin und Performance-Künstlerin Kyara Orlando (Brasilien, Großbritannien) und der Künstlerin, Performerin und Kuratorin Katerina Barampouti (Griechenland, Großbritannien) gestaltet. Wir haben uns zusammengetan, um eine Geschichte zu erzählen: wie mächtig Menschen sind, wenn wir uns verzaubern lassen; wenn wir in Kontakt mit unserer Heiligkeit und unserem Bewusstsein sind. Davon wollen wir dir eine Kostprobe geben.
Lasst uns erleben und überprüfen, wie wir Menschen uns zu den Elementen der Natur, zur Umwelt und zu uns selbst verhalten. Durch Performances von Kyara Orlando, eine fotografische Erzählung von Dhan Ribeiro und damit verbundene Kunstaktionen, die von Katerina Barampouti geleitet und kuratiert werden, beschwört Big Snake Ziggzagging in Me den Zauber unserer physischen Welt herauf und legt eine kreative Beziehung zu all den existenziellen Dynamiken, die unseren Planeten so besonders machen, nahe. Das Projekt verwendet den Mythos der Großen Kobra (Cobra Grande) als Bezugspunkt: Dieser Mythos durchdringt das Gebiet des Amazonas und spricht von der fruchtbaren Lebenskraft, die ständig die Welt erschafft - und die wir in unserer DNA tragen.
Wirf einen Blick auf unsere virtuelle Ausstellung mit einigen von Dhan's besten Fotografien:
https://www.artsteps.com/view/607c9ca3fd9455a4fd6b9da1
Dieses Projekt wurde am 12. November 2020 online mit einer Diskussionsrunde, einem Mini-Workshop und einer Online-Performance gestartet. Eine virtuelle Ausstellung findet derzeit statt und eine physische Fotografie- und Kunstausstellung zusammen mit einer Reihe an Live-Workshops wird im Juli 2021 in der Galerie The Koppel Project Hive in London stattfinden (5. Juli bis 6. August 2021).
An dieser Stelle brauchen wir deine Hilfe bei der Realisierung der physischen Ausstellung. The Koppel Project unterstützt uns großzügig mit einem erstaunlichen, gut ausgestatteten Raum im Herzen Londons (www.thekoppelproject.com) und mit der Produktion und dem Management des Projekts. Deine individuelle Unterstützung wird uns ermöglichen, die Anforderungen an die Ausstellungsinstallation an das Aufführungsmaterial zu erfüllen, qualitativ hochwertige Fotos zu drucken und auch die Veranstaltungen zu dokumentieren und zu vermarkten. 
Leitet das Projekt weiter, im Vertrauen auf die Fähigkeit der Kunst, die menschliche Wahrnehmung zu inspirieren, zu erziehen und zu bewegen. Ausgedrückt durch Bilder, Klänge, gesprochenes Wort, Umweltaktivismus, Schamanismus und die Kraft des Geschichtenerzählens. Du kannst dazu beitragen!
Und vor allem hoffen wir darauf, dich während unserer physischen Ausstellung und/oder unserer virtuellen Veranstaltungen zu sehen!
Unsere tiefste Dankbarkeit.
 
Was wir brauchen & was du bekommst
Im Wesentlichen werden die Mittel für Folgendes verwendet:
70% Produktionskosten in Großbritannien, einschließlich aller Materialien, Drucksachen, IV, technische Anforderungen und Versicherung 
20% Reise- und Vorbereitungskosten der Künstler/Darsteller
10% Verwaltung und Marketing
Wenn die Kampagne ihr Ziel übersteigt, werden alle zusätzlichen Gelder für eine Rückerstattung an alle teilnehmenden Künstler und auch an die Terra Mirim Foundation, die schamanische Gemeinschaft, in der die Fotos dieser Ausstellung aufgenommen wurden, verwendet. Terra Mirim befindet sich in Bahia, Brasilien, in einem Schutzgebiet des Atlantischen Waldes, und ist auf Spenden wie diese angewiesen, um seine unermüdliche Arbeit fortzusetzen und Menschen aus der ganzen Welt zu empfangen, die Heilung und einen Lebensweg in Gemeinschaft und Ko-Kreation mit der Natur suchen.
Wenn die Kampagne ihr Ziel nicht erreicht, wird sie uns dennoch helfen, weil sie einen Teil der anfallenden Kosten zusteuert und wir werden für immer dankbar sein! Jede Hilfe wird sehr geschätzt.

Risiken und Herausforderungen
Wir vertrauen und hoffen, dass wir alle bei guter Gesundheit sind; unter Berücksichtigung der aktuellen weltweiten Krise und aller unvorhergesehenen Ereignisse sind wir entschlossen, dieses Projekt zu realisieren und eine wirklich sinnvolle und nützliche Erfahrung mit unserem Publikum zu teilen. Wir sind flexibel und in der Lage, die Präsentationstermine zu verschieben und auch mehr virtuelle Veranstaltungen durchzuführen.
Wir stellen seit mehr als zwei Jahrzehnten komplexe Veranstaltungen zusammen und sind zuversichtlich, dass wir auch diese Veranstaltung reibungslos organisieren können. Wir halten, was wir versprechen, und verwenden umweltfreundliche, fair gehandelte Materialien. 
 
Projektbeschreibung - Der Mythos und das Erlebnis:
Der Mythos der ""Großen Kobra"" (""Cobra Grande"" auf Lateinisch) durchdringt das Gebiet des Amazonas. Ihre Präsenz ist entlang der großen Flüsse ebenso zu spüren wie in den weiten und offenen Flächen der brasilianischen Savannen. Eine uralte Präsenz - die auch als 'die Verzauberte' oder 'Caianinha' bekannt ist - wird in den Rädern der Geschichten bewahrt, die von den verschiedenen Waldvölkern erzählt werden und die uns durch deren Weitergabe geschenkt wurden und sich in unsere spielerische und heilige Vorstellungskraft einweben. Obwohl wir nicht direkt aus dem Schoß der 'Mutter des Waldes' ('Madre Floresta') stammen, tragen wir die Gene der Vielfalt und des Überflusses in uns. Ein fruchtbarer Zustand der Verzauberung, der uns oft durch die vier Ecken dieses Kontinents führt.
Die Fotoausstellung 'Cobra Grande - Big Snake Ziggzagging in Me' teilt die Essenz der 'Cobra Grande'-Geschichte und erschafft den Mythos durch Aktionen und Bilder neu. Sie erzählt von der Kreatur, die im Zickzack an den Ufern des Flusses entlangläuft und sich selbst befruchtet, und von den Bewohnern des Flusses, die sie vom Schatten des Waldes aus auf ihrer Suche nach dem kosmischen Ozean beobachten. Es ist ein Versuch, den Ehetanz der 'Cobra Grande' darzustellen und zu enthüllen, die von der Fruchtbarkeit, die vom magischen Königreich der verzauberten Menschen des Waldes ausgeht, schwanger wird. Die Schauspielerin Kyara Orlando bringt die mythische Beziehung zwischen der Sichtbarkeit und Unsichtbarkeit der Welt zum Ausdruck und verkörpert den Geist der 'Verzauberten Schlange' durch eine schamanische Performance in den dunklen Gewässern des Flusses Itamboatá, während der Fotograf und Schamane Dhan Ribeiro den Prozess in einer fotografischen Erzählung aus 45 Farbfotografien dokumentiert. Diese Fotografien versuchen, den Betrachter in den angestammten Raum der Menschen des Waldes eintauchen zu lassen; umgeben von Stammesgesängen, 'Icaros' und Klängen des Waldes - und eine visuelle Aufzeichnung der expressiven Entfaltung zu schaffen, die jedem Moment vor der Kamera folgte. Inmitten der Vegetation tauchten die ersten Sonnenstrahlen den Raum in ein goldenes Licht und erzeugten Tiefe, Kontrast und Volumen in den Bildern, welche am Morgen des 6. Januar 2019 aufgenommen wurden. Die gesamte Arbeit wurde innerhalb der Szenerie ausgeführt, die die Natur selbst geschaffen hat, und ermöglichte so die Entwicklung der Geschichte innerhalb eines schönen Konzepts des reinen magischen Realismus: wo Realität und Magie unsere spielerische Fähigkeit inspirieren, sich vollständig dem Ausdruck zu öffnen.
Katerina Barampouti kuratiert einen heiligen Raum für Kyara Orlando und Dhan Ribeiro, um die mythische Erfahrung der Cobra Grande zu gewährleisten und bringt darüber hinaus verschiedene Kreative und Denker zusammen, damit diese sich austauschen und Praktiken und Wissen zu teilen.

Denise was born into the Native Arts and Craft industry in 1968. A Navajo descendant, she followed in her family's footsteps and built a small successful Native Arts and Crafts business. Still vending to date, she has successfully created and sold Navajo art for over forty years.  In 2011, her daughter Heather Tracy, branded them “Navajo Secrets.” This brand would represent four generations of their family’s Native Artistry. The brand made them recognizable, contactable, and trustable. And just like the market, this family-business only showcases authentic handmade Native items. Though successful, “Navajo Secrets” still relies on pop-up art events throughout Arizona and California. Most are only hosted once a year. That, in turn, was how the vision of Native Art Market was born. And now operates weekly in the Phoenix Metropolitan area. To launch, Navajo Secrets invested over $20,000 of their own funds to start Native Art Market.  </p><p>Fast forward two years, Native Art Market is a huge success, and eagerly awaits season three. What started out with a simple vision became a significant community effort.  The market has now operated successfully for two years and now offers over 2,000 opportunities a year for individual Native artists and entertainers.  Native Art Market has also collaborated with entities such as Cornerstone Productions from Los Angeles and ASU Gammage in Tempe. Organizing Indigenous markets for their larger events. They are currently working with AIA (Arizonas Indigenous Agriculture) to add-on an Indigenous Farmers Market. This expansion was scheduled for the Fall of 2020 but has been postponed to the Fall of 2021 due to COVID-19. </p><p>THE OBSTACLE</p><p>It has already been estimated that the Native arts and crafts industry generates a billion dollars annually(Source: National Geographic). Yet, Native Americans see LESS than a million of this.  For many Native Americans, making and selling handmade jewelry, pottery, carved figurines, and other crafts provide livelihoods. In addition, Native Americans are subjected to cultural appropriation and imitation, including fake handcrafts being manufactured overseas and brought back to the United States. The sale and misrepresentation of imitation goods has been occurring for decades and there are no signs this will abate. </p><p>In March 2020, like many businesses globally, Native Art Market was impacted by the pandemic, resulting in the cancellation of the last few weekends of the season. Covid-19 has also impacted the sole sponsors Navajo Secrets. Who in the past, have provided funds for the market's start-up each year. With that in mind, it also opened the doors for vacant spaces in Old Town Scottsdale. </p><p>Most retail stores in this area are non-native owned. The unique selling point for the second location is it will be one of the first Native owned shop operated by passionate, experienced, and knowledgeable Native Americans. It will also ensure Native American artisans can sell their goods and know they will receive a fair price to support their livelihoods. We will feature different artisans every week with live demonstrations of their artwork. Shoppers can enjoy a cup of cowboy coffee or Navajo tea while witnessing rug weaving, silversmithing, kachina carving, live painting, and storytelling.</p><p>Thank you for your time. 400 Native families eagerly await your response.

In collaboration with the software company afca., we at ARTinTRA, want to create a new type of exhibition platform offering you an innovative, augmented reality (AR) experience using the latest cutting-edge technology. The mobile application (app) will allow you to visit, curate and share virtual art exhibitions from wherever you are; be this from your living room or the desert, via your phone or tablet.</p><p>But we can't do this without your help!</p><p> </p><p><strong>BACKGROUND INFORMATION (BREXIT, COVID-19, and new realities)</strong> </p><p>Our story begins with the timely and exciting project “Complex States: Art in the Years of Brexit” curated by Vassiliki Tzanakou (ARTinTRA director) and Catherine Harrington; the first exhibition we hope to present on our state-of-the-art, AR platform. </p><p>As the Brexit negotiations come to a close, Complex States presents a diverse selection of artworks made between 2016-2019 by leading and emerging artists across the political spectrum; and with many works made as a direct response to the EU referendum vote in 2016. Through this project we aim to cross boundaries both physically and creatively; and create new spaces of dialogue, understanding and collaboration.</p><p>This exhibition proposal began two years ago as a one venue, offline show. The project was complete and ready to go, yet COVID-19 brought our plans to a crashing halt. But we didn’t want to give up. In order to realise the exhibition we looked outwards to the world; to our friends; and to the digital sphere. From our living rooms we reached out to art organisations, galleries, creative spaces and innovators asking for solidarity, and calling for collaboration in a time of isolation.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1603097258/y4iydkq0czfauhmisydh.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Since then, our exhibition has changed from a one venue offline show, to an international multi-venue project including an innovative digital exhibition platform. With the help of afca., the new platform will consist of a comprehensive and accessible website and a cutting-edge AR app that uses Microsoft's recently released Azure Spatial Anchors. </p><p>Azure Spatial Anchors enable users to install, share and store virtual artworks in their own current location; and thus also see where other users have placed artworks. This technology can then allow Complex States to be installed and viewed virtually, in multiple forms anywhere in the world. Users of our app can design and then publish their own version of the Complex States virtual exhibition in a location of their choice (their home, their garden, their university. etc) using the available virtual artworks in the Complex States exhibition. Other users can then visit the location of this virtual exhibition at any time and view the exhibition with their own AR-capable device.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602155254/iek4vyun9r8ck9uzmso6.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Thanks to the support of friends and colleagues, we are close to launching this radical reinvention of our project. Yet, we need your support to take that final step.  We want to realise this project to its fullest so that we can offer you a unique tool that allows you to experience and curate great art when-ever and where-ever you are.</p><p> </p><p><strong>WHAT WE NEED  </strong></p><p>We need to raise £21, 100 to produce the AR application and to create a dedicated website. Complex States will be our pilot project, which will allow us to showcase and test the new digital platform. </p><p>In particular the funds will be used to:</p><ul>
<li>Digitise all the artworks (Rendering &amp; processing of 3D content) </li>
<li>Develop the website</li>
<li>Develop a mobile AR app for Android and iOS (pilot app)</li>
<li>Work on the graphic design</li>
<li>Create the experience design for the website and AR app</li>

In collaboration with the software company afca., we at ARTinTRA, want to create a new type of exhibition platform offering you an innovative, augmented reality (AR) experience using the latest cutting-edge technology. The mobile application (app) will allow you to visit, curate and share virtual art exhibitions from wherever you are; be this from your living room or the desert, via your phone or tablet.But we can't do this without your help! BACKGROUND INFORMATION (BREXIT, COVID-19, and new realities) Our story begins with the timely and exciting project “Complex States: Art in the Years of Brexit” curated by Vassiliki Tzanakou (ARTinTRA director) and Catherine Harrington; the first exhibition we hope to present on our state-of-the-art, AR platform. As the Brexit negotiations come to a close, Complex States presents a diverse selection of artworks made between 2016-2019 by leading and emerging artists across the political spectrum; and with many works made as a direct response to the EU referendum vote in 2016. Through this project we aim to cross boundaries both physically and creatively; and create new spaces of dialogue, understanding and collaboration.This exhibition proposal began two years ago as a one venue, offline show. The project was complete and ready to go, yet COVID-19 brought our plans to a crashing halt. But we didn’t want to give up. In order to realise the exhibition we looked outwards to the world; to our friends; and to the digital sphere. From our living rooms we reached out to art organisations, galleries, creative spaces and innovators asking for solidarity, and calling for collaboration in a time of isolation.Since then, our exhibition has changed from a one venue offline show, to an international multi-venue project including an innovative digital exhibition platform. With the help of afca., the new platform will consist of a comprehensive and accessible website and a cutting-edge AR app that uses Microsoft's recently released Azure Spatial Anchors. Azure Spatial Anchors enable users to install, share and store virtual artworks in their own current location; and thus also see where other users have placed artworks. This technology can then allow Complex States to be installed and viewed virtually, in multiple forms anywhere in the world. Users of our app can design and then publish their own version of the Complex States virtual exhibition in a location of their choice (their home, their garden, their university. etc) using the available virtual artworks in the Complex States exhibition. Other users can then visit the location of this virtual exhibition at any time and view the exhibition with their own AR-capable device.Thanks to the support of friends and colleagues, we are close to launching this radical reinvention of our project. Yet, we need your support to take that final step.  We want to realise this project to its fullest so that we can offer you a unique tool that allows you to experience and curate great art when-ever and where-ever you are. WHAT WE NEED  We need to raise £21, 100 to produce the AR application and to create a dedicated website. Complex States will be our pilot project, which will allow us to showcase and test the new digital platform. In particular the funds will be used to:
Digitise all the artworks (Rendering & processing of 3D content) 
Develop the website
Develop a mobile AR app for Android and iOS (pilot app)
Work on the graphic design
Create the experience design for the website and AR app
 In case we do not meet the target, the funds raised will still go to the development of the platform. However, we will have to cut down on the number of functions and services we are offering. The AR app will be available on Google Play and in the Apple Store. WHAT YOU GET  (CHECK OUR PERKS OUT) THE IMPACT Our AR application will offer a thrilling and radically-new way of experiencing art.

<p>  Your support will help me buy art production supplies, which are surprisingly expensive.  Aside from the above mentioned items, the cost of making a painting is not cheap. For example, the materials used to make brushes vary greatly.  A brush made from camel hair is not an expensive item and would typically cost $15, while sable brushes could cost upwards of $150 each. The quality of the brushstroke you can get with a sable brush is superior.  Manufacturing art materials is a small market, which also influences cost.  There are very few discount houses for the higher quality art materials.  Additionally, these items  all have a fragile shelf life and that drives prices higher. Because of the short shelf life, the artist has to buy smaller quantities.  There is also certain amount of price gouging since merchants understand that people will pay whatever the price for the right supplies. Because the higher quality of the materials gives a better result, artists are compelled to pay whatever the market will bear.</p>
<p>Here are some typical price points;</p>
<ul>
<li>Paintbrush: $9 - $60</li>
<li>Tube of Oil Paint: $11 - $92</li>
<li>Canvas: $35 - $150</li>
<li>Prismacolor Colored Pencil: $3 - 5</li>
<li>Watercolor block tablet: $25 - $209</li>
<li>Storage Portfolio: $20 - $200</li>

<h3>My Artist Statement</h3>
<p>The impulse to create has been with me for as long as I can remember. Since the time I could first hold a crayon, I would draw on anything. Several years back, my older brother was moving across country. As he sorted through years of mementos, he came across a cigar box stuffed with drawings I had given him as a 4 year old. My brother had made notes on them, describing the picture. Many of them were of angels.</p>
<p>My favorite aunt would never fail to bring me a box of crayons whenever she visited us. I loved her for that. She fed my habit. My Mother enrolled me in Art Enrichment classes when I was a very young child at the Toledo Museum of Art. They were famous for their Saturday children’s classes. I remember my disappointment when the teacher insisted that I draw a dinosaur. I was not interested in dinosaurs, and I absolutely hated the fact that charcoal sticks were our only tool. Things got better. The drive to make my own statement has been with me ever since. I consider creating images my heart’s work. As I have matured, that impulse has come into balance with self-trust.</p>
<p>When things are going well, I experience what Michael Csikszentmihalyi (CHICK-zent-mi-high) calls a flow state. In his book Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience (1990) he described the flow state as one in which an athlete or other person performs at his or her best, seemingly without effort, but rather with total concentration, feeling totally in control without thinking about it. Self- consciousness recedes into the background as total focus is upon present activity.</p>
<p>For many years, I enjoyed drawing still life and quiet landscapes. In my most recent work, I am always imagining the unlikely.  Looking at a forest path, hills, or a lake, it is as if I am able to see right through its placid exterior. My mind’s eye restructures the scene into a quietly fantastical realm where birds, flowers, sky, and earth do not behave as one normally expects them to. In that sense, my paintings rebel against reality. The hard part is to plan a picture so as to give to others what has happened to me. I want to give the viewer an experience, to suggest the sense of light and color.</p>
<p>Although I base my paintings on real locations; I embellish them with my own impressions  of real experience and dreamlike perceptions. The pictures are usually making statements about power, joy  and freedom. I have always wanted my work to have a light joyousness to it which never lets the viewer suspect how much effort went into it.</p>
<p>I like to create images using casual pattern and a sense of motion in my pictures.  I use color to suggest lightness and a pristine transcendence. </p>

<p><strong>Details- at least some of them: </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong>Our small group of Veterans, all disabled in some form or fashion, wish to transform our small business to something that will benefit our extended community of veterans.  </p>
<p>The intent is to expand our operation in scope and to transform it into a learning center and 'boost' for other veterans and active duty military preparing to leave the service.   The objective is to train those service men and women in a viable and marketable skill that will allow them, at the very least, a fall back trade craft. </p>
<p>We will pay as we 'certify' these men and women, through profit sharing of their productions, and we will offer to make them part of our 'network' of skilled craftsmen for future efforts, allowing them to co-op our mutual goals of production and at the level of involvement they choose.   </p>
<p>Our intent is to remain 'for profit' throughout.  We are offering a 'hand up' to be seized, as opposed to something that strikes at their pride.  We, through our own experience, realize <i>woodworking and crafting is actually therapy</i>, and we realize securing the ability to be self-sufficient critical to successful transition from service to civilian life.   </p>
<p>Something else we know to be truth- maintaining comradery and 'esprit de corps' happens when those of like experiences and understandings look toward each other and know there is support, there is a greater sense of community, and that there will <strong><i>always </i>be hope</strong>.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Funding to either lease or purchase commercial property in location already identified.</li>
<li>Funding to expand equipment to meet production volume required by wholesalers in effort to qualify as a vendor.  </li>
<li>Funding to set up the new location (our current shop is small and great for one on one but not at the scale we're aiming for) in a safe conditions and suitable for learning and volume of production. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Goal</span></strong></p>
<p>I would like to be supplying goods to wholesalers no later than third quarter of this year, whether from our current shop or the proposed location- or both- and offering training to the first round of veterans as the production commences. </p>
<p>Likewise, we would like to gain attention from larger veterans outreach and incorporate aspects into this concept that actually engage in a tangible way- such as working with county and state SBA representatives who can come out and give short classes on business structures and licensing.   To work with local retailers who either purchase items from <i>this</i> operation OR set up directly with our mentors as they hone their skills.   There are literally hundreds of opportunities to entwine with existing foundations and non-profits, government and private organizations to achieve what we are truly seeking- and that is to lower the '22 a day' to zero&lt;- if you 'know' you 'know'.  </p>
<p>These men and women will set forth into the world, with backing, knowledge, and a skill- and being who they are they will pass it to others within their reach..... and.... within there is success. </p>

<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>I've pushed, pulled, kicked and cussed this operation into fruition and by spending my life savings to start it.  </p>
<ul>

</tbody></table></div>","BLUF (the Bottom Line Up Front) 
Our goal is to open a workshop and storefront offering both retail and wholesale goods both to the public as well as to identified wholesalers and through creation of 'blanks'.   Our intent is to bring in veteran's specifically as we are veterans ourselves, and teach them how we do what we do.  Our tactic is to provide a skill through instruction and sharing, and offering opportunity to market their creations immediately.  Our strategy is to provide comradery and sense of purpose; create a community of people who were once part of another community; spark or maintain that sense of belonging while providing a road map on how to operate independently yet in rhythm with others of the group; to create hope, and an opportunity to spread hope to others.  We may not eliminate the 22 Veteran Suicides a day, but we are- you better believe it- going straight at it in the manner that we can and doing everything we can to prevent it, at least in the locality we find ourselves. 
Details- at least some of them: 
 Our small group of Veterans, all disabled in some form or fashion, wish to transform our small business to something that will benefit our extended community of veterans.  
The intent is to expand our operation in scope and to transform it into a learning center and 'boost' for other veterans and active duty military preparing to leave the service.   The objective is to train those service men and women in a viable and marketable skill that will allow them, at the very least, a fall back trade craft. 
We will pay as we 'certify' these men and women, through profit sharing of their productions, and we will offer to make them part of our 'network' of skilled craftsmen for future efforts, allowing them to co-op our mutual goals of production and at the level of involvement they choose.   
Our intent is to remain 'for profit' throughout.  We are offering a 'hand up' to be seized, as opposed to something that strikes at their pride.  We, through our own experience, realize woodworking and crafting is actually therapy, and we realize securing the ability to be self-sufficient critical to successful transition from service to civilian life.   
Something else we know to be truth- maintaining comradery and 'esprit de corps' happens when those of like experiences and understandings look toward each other and know there is support, there is a greater sense of community, and that there will always be hope.  
Needs in Detail - Product Explained

What we need to realize the goal we've set:

Funding to either lease or purchase commercial property in location already identified.
Funding to expand equipment to meet production volume required by wholesalers in effort to qualify as a vendor.  
Funding to set up the new location (our current shop is small and great for one on one but not at the scale we're aiming for) in a safe conditions and suitable for learning and volume of production. 

The Goal
I would like to be supplying goods to wholesalers no later than third quarter of this year, whether from our current shop or the proposed location- or both- and offering training to the first round of veterans as the production commences. 
Likewise, we would like to gain attention from larger veterans outreach and incorporate aspects into this concept that actually engage in a tangible way- such as working with county and state SBA representatives who can come out and give short classes on business structures and licensing.   To work with local retailers who either purchase items from this operation OR set up directly with our mentors as they hone their skills.   There are literally hundreds of opportunities to entwine with existing foundations and non-profits, government and private organizations to achieve what we are truly seeking- and that is to lower the '22 a day' to zero<- if you 'know' you 'know'.  
These men and women will set forth into the world, with backing, knowledge, and a skill- and being who they are they will pass it to others within their reach..... and.... within there is success. 

Risks & Challenges
I've pushed, pulled, kicked and cussed this operation into fruition and by spending my life savings to start it.  

I've identified a market that is sustainable for my initial offering as well as modular in approach to future expansion. 
The market is identified- it isn't probing. It isn't 'maybe'.  It is there if I can only meet the expectations in volume of production to meet qualifications as a 'vendor' to identified wholesalers.
Careful monitoring through ledger and on-the-books purchase requests will allow barometer for limiting expenses and in reconciliation of asset valuations in effort to remain at least solvent during all phases and into future efforts.


Other Ways You Can Help
Please, share the word over this concept.  I'm ambitious enough to take the reigns in this geographical location, but not nearly so to support other areas.  Now if one of those passing through 'my' operation as student takes that initiative? Wow- that would be great.  I'd even help by providing the road map and whatever financial assistance I could.  But for now? Share the word about this concept.  That would be a massive help!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>100 Women and More has been almost six years in the making. I am both passionate and determined to do justice for my art and the women I am representing. As this project has grown, so have I. Join me in honor of those who have inspired you to pursue your dreams, against all odds!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My goal is to stage an exhibit of all 100 portraits, but it’s more than that. As I’ve worked on this series, I’ve had a growing sense of importance that people should be able to have the entire collection at their disposal. While the book will contain my selected 100 influential women, it will also include blank pages for the addition of the amazing and inspirational women in the buyer’s life whether world famous or known only in the family. Why have I included this element in the project? I realized that in one series of portraits, I could never hope to include every woman who has blazed a new trail or inspired others to follow in their footsteps. This opportunity to include those inspiring to you, creates a very personal connection to women’s stories and the owner’s own life.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All portraits are done!  So now, your funding will:</p>
<p>•       Pay for professional graphic design and layout of the book (about $3000)</p>
<p>•       Pay for printing and binding of 500 copies of the book (about $5000)</p>
<p>•       Pay for expenses to mount a gallery show, including printing of promotional materials</p>
<ul><li>Pay for legal consult (almost $2000)</li></ul>
<p>•       Pay for shipping materials</p>
<p> </p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In 2012, I was told that, as a tall woman with a low voice, I was intimidating. It was suggested that I learn to speak in a higher register. That same week, I watched the film “The Iron Lady.” The scene where Margaret Thatcher is coached to speak in a lower register so that her male counterparts would take her seriously hit me hard. “We women just can’t win,” I thought and thus was born the idea for an art project.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I wanted to highlight the double standards that exist for women and how successful women are often marginalized or criticized. I began by researching influential women in history and tried to find evidence of the criticisms hurled at them. However, 100 Women and More has taken on a life of its own. The response to sharing the first few pieces was overwhelming. The women chosen for the book were culled from lists of names offered up by friends and Facebook followers. The project is no longer about highlighting the double standard, but instead about allowing these women to stand on their own merit for their achievement. That’s more than enough.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge to this project is in ensuring that there are no copyright violations in what is published. I am working diligently to ensure that all images created are credited and that the words, while sourced, are my own. I have established a timeline for project completion that I am confident I can meet.</p>

<p>Hi! I am Xiao.  I make sculptures, and they are often kinetic. </p>
<p>I received an abandoned truck camper with broken hydraulic jacks mid September 2016.  It is an object that easily triggers one's sympathy, without a truck to travel with, this camper just sits statically, like a lost domesticated pet, or an amputated limb from someone's body.  While building proper support for this camper, I developed an urge to revive it.  </p>
<p>What better way to revive it than letting it walk?</p>
<p>Now I have designed a customized platform for the camper to go on, giving it 6 functional legs to stumble through space.  Feasibility of the project has been confirmed through consulting mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering professionals.  </p>
<p>If I gather enough funds, the camper will be up and running by April 2017!</p>
<p>Want a closer look at plans of this project?  Maquettes and drawings are being shown at Odeon Alley Window Gallery from January 16th to January 30th, Yates Street, downtown Victoria BC. </p>
<h3>Who Controls the Camper's Motion?</h3>
<p>The answer is you. </p>
<p>The camper's motion is controlled by an user inside of it.  A set of pedals will be set in frontal portion of the camper, with large amount of sensors that pick up pedalling pace and orientation, sending a message to control motor's amperage input and rotation direction.  Top bed area will be cut out and replaced by acrylic sheet, providing a wide view of where you are going. </p>
<h3>Who/where I go for technical obstacles</h3>

<p>Steven recently completed a master program combining computer science and visual arts.  I am in awe of his creativity and wide range of skill set.  I am more than glad to have his help with motor control!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>To build a platform with structural integrity that has enough power, I need your support to acquire the following parts and expenditures: </p>
<ul>
<li>I-Beams (legs)</li>
<li>Cost for accurate machining housings for axles, and joints. </li>
<li>Motor &amp; motor controller (AmpFlow A28-400-F48-G Gearmotor &amp; VEX high voltage controller)</li>
<li>Deep cycle batteries with high ampere hour x 4</li>
<li>Hall effect sensors, reed switches</li>
<li>Welded hydraulic cylinders x 6</li>
<li>Sprockets, roller chain, bearings (Lots of them!)</li>
<li>Repair fee for HiJackers (cheapest way to safely lower the camper)</li>
<li>Scissor jacks</li>
<li>Coupling nuts, threaded metal, bolts (Lots of them!)</li>
<li>Rods and sheets of medal </li>
<li>One large acrylic sheet</li>
<li>Rental fees for portable TIG welder</li>
<li>Cost for accurate machining housings for axles and camper's legs</li>
</ul>
<p>With scholarship, other committed funding, and savings, there is $6500 still to raise. </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Every bit of your contribution will go to producing the camper's platform.  Aside from my eternal gratefulness, you can also get priority test rides before the camper's debut in April, studio tours, prints of drafts, or a mysterious gift from me to you. </p>
</div><div>

</div></div>","Hi! I am Xiao.  I make sculptures, and they are often kinetic. 
I received an abandoned truck camper with broken hydraulic jacks mid September 2016.  It is an object that easily triggers one's sympathy, without a truck to travel with, this camper just sits statically, like a lost domesticated pet, or an amputated limb from someone's body.  While building proper support for this camper, I developed an urge to revive it.  
What better way to revive it than letting it walk?
Now I have designed a customized platform for the camper to go on, giving it 6 functional legs to stumble through space.  Feasibility of the project has been confirmed through consulting mechanical engineering, and electrical engineering professionals.  
If I gather enough funds, the camper will be up and running by April 2017!
Want a closer look at plans of this project?  Maquettes and drawings are being shown at Odeon Alley Window Gallery from January 16th to January 30th, Yates Street, downtown Victoria BC. 
Who Controls the Camper's Motion?
The answer is you. 
The camper's motion is controlled by an user inside of it.  A set of pedals will be set in frontal portion of the camper, with large amount of sensors that pick up pedalling pace and orientation, sending a message to control motor's amperage input and rotation direction.  Top bed area will be cut out and replaced by acrylic sheet, providing a wide view of where you are going. 
Who/where I go for technical obstacles

Theo Christiaanse 
Mechanical Advisor
Theo completed a Bachelor of Engineering and Master of Applied Science, currently a PhD student in mechanical engineering.  Luckily, I get to pick his brain for material selections, structural problems, and better assembly methods!

Steven Bjornson
Electrical Technician
Steven recently completed a master program combining computer science and visual arts.  I am in awe of his creativity and wide range of skill set.  I am more than glad to have his help with motor control!

What I Need
To build a platform with structural integrity that has enough power, I need your support to acquire the following parts and expenditures: 

I-Beams (legs)
Cost for accurate machining housings for axles, and joints. 
Motor & motor controller (AmpFlow A28-400-F48-G Gearmotor & VEX high voltage controller)
Deep cycle batteries with high ampere hour x 4
Hall effect sensors, reed switches
Welded hydraulic cylinders x 6
Sprockets, roller chain, bearings (Lots of them!)
Repair fee for HiJackers (cheapest way to safely lower the camper)
Scissor jacks
Coupling nuts, threaded metal, bolts (Lots of them!)
Rods and sheets of medal 
One large acrylic sheet
Rental fees for portable TIG welder
Cost for accurate machining housings for axles and camper's legs

With scholarship, other committed funding, and savings, there is $6500 still to raise. 
What You Get
Every bit of your contribution will go to producing the camper's platform.  Aside from my eternal gratefulness, you can also get priority test rides before the camper's debut in April, studio tours, prints of drafts, or a mysterious gift from me to you. 

The Impact
The walking camper is built for everyone.  
As the title suggests, the walking camper is meant to be something for people to ponder on.   I am not aiming for the camper to be an extravaganza that takes strides of pride.  It is rather a kinetic tableau of one who accepts vulnerability, and utilize that as a chance to obtain clarity.  This notion is heartwarming to me, and I want to share it with as many as I could through this project. 
Building this camper will not be an one woman job, a diverse group of creative individuals brings this project closer to reality each day by providing insights, discussing assembly solutions, possibility for materials, etc.  Your contribution for this project supports a diverse community, it also make this 1760 pounds truck camper into art, instead of a lump at a junkyard.  

Risks & Challenges
This is the most ambitious project I have ever attempted, with potential engineering challenges, and needs of labour help at some stages of assembly.  So if you feel like volunteering, for offering insight, labour help, etc, please do!

<h1>What is Color Vision?</h1>
<p>Our eyes can see different wavelengths of light, and our brain perceives them as colors. Some people are awesome at differentiating color, but some people have a bit of trouble telling apart colors - usually greens and reds, but sometimes blues or yellows too. Color blindness affects 8.5% of the population.</p>
<p></p>
<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://ksr-ugc.imgix.net/assets/013/282/923/3a0cf04ff5b9b2d02e6f7d2cf582bc74_original.jpg?w=680&amp;fit=max&amp;v=1470379109&amp;auto=format&amp;q=92&amp;s=e84ca114183eda16f8e8cb2f6f3acc1c"" src="""" style=""width: 284.667px;height: 427px;""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1470416635/playa_colorblind_zoqpxw.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 283.374px;height: 426px;background-color: initial;""/></figure><p></p>
<h1>What if we could bring color vision to the color blind in one of the most colorful and creative places in the world? </h1>
<p>A company called <a href=""http://enchroma.com/technology/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Enchroma</a> has developed a lens that fits into glasses that can correct most types of colorblindness. After a few months of research and hours on Youtube, I've watched people discover ""green"" and ""purple"" and ""pink"" for the very first time. This year on playa I'd like to bring one pair of Enchroma glasses and find as many people as I can to show them the joys of color. On average of 5,500 people on playa are color blind every year.</p>
<p>ChromaMagic will be a project that develops creative contraptions that people look through using Enchroma's lenses to bring color to the color blind. Last year I built an amazing art project called Zooplankton, but I can't even imagine what it would have looked like without all of the amazing colors of LEDs on it. This year there will be hundreds of art projects on playa. As an artist, I want to help the visually disabled view these art projects in full color vision! I'll be volunteering at Cascadia Serepeum and Black Rock Observatory, but in addition I would like to bring ChromaMagic to other artwork to allow color blind people to view art in color. </p>

<p>On my own I will be purchasing refraction glasses (the ones that make rainbows at night). If someone were colorblind they might see a scattered version of these rainbow bursts when they wore the glasses, but with the magic of Enchroma, they'll be able to experience nearly the full spectrum of colors. I'll also be bringing design books full of colorful photos and images for people to look at!</p>
<p>ChromaMagic will evolve into a larger art project over the next 2 years involving kaleidoscopes, viewmasters, led panels, a bike trailer with a sign, and space helmets.. but to get this project off the ground this year, we need money to purchase one pair of Enchroma glasses before we hit the playa this year! </p>
<p>Indiegogo has a project minimum of $500</p>
<p>The funds from this project will go to:</p>
<p>Enchroma Glasses - $429<br/>the remainder of any money raised will go towards the future of ChromaMagic including developing a ChromaMagic viewfinder and kaleidescope.</p>

<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>This project is last minute. That's why I'm creating an Indiegogo. If you don't think it's worthy then it's not going to happen this year.</p>

Our eyes can see different wavelengths of light, and our brain perceives them as colors. Some people are awesome at differentiating color, but some people have a bit of trouble telling apart colors - usually greens and reds, but sometimes blues or yellows too. Color blindness affects 8.5% of the population.


What if we could bring color vision to the color blind in one of the most colorful and creative places in the world? 
A company called Enchroma has developed a lens that fits into glasses that can correct most types of colorblindness. After a few months of research and hours on Youtube, I've watched people discover ""green"" and ""purple"" and ""pink"" for the very first time. This year on playa I'd like to bring one pair of Enchroma glasses and find as many people as I can to show them the joys of color. On average of 5,500 people on playa are color blind every year.
ChromaMagic will be a project that develops creative contraptions that people look through using Enchroma's lenses to bring color to the color blind. Last year I built an amazing art project called Zooplankton, but I can't even imagine what it would have looked like without all of the amazing colors of LEDs on it. This year there will be hundreds of art projects on playa. As an artist, I want to help the visually disabled view these art projects in full color vision! I'll be volunteering at Cascadia Serepeum and Black Rock Observatory, but in addition I would like to bring ChromaMagic to other artwork to allow color blind people to view art in color. 





On my own I will be purchasing refraction glasses (the ones that make rainbows at night). If someone were colorblind they might see a scattered version of these rainbow bursts when they wore the glasses, but with the magic of Enchroma, they'll be able to experience nearly the full spectrum of colors. I'll also be bringing design books full of colorful photos and images for people to look at!
ChromaMagic will evolve into a larger art project over the next 2 years involving kaleidoscopes, viewmasters, led panels, a bike trailer with a sign, and space helmets.. but to get this project off the ground this year, we need money to purchase one pair of Enchroma glasses before we hit the playa this year! 
Indiegogo has a project minimum of $500
The funds from this project will go to:
Enchroma Glasses - $429the remainder of any money raised will go towards the future of ChromaMagic including developing a ChromaMagic viewfinder and kaleidescope.




Risks and challenges
This project is last minute. That's why I'm creating an Indiegogo. If you don't think it's worthy then it's not going to happen this year.
Last year I completed Zooplankton, through all of its challenges. This year I'll be working shifts at greeters, Cascadia Serepeum, and Black Rock Observatory. Between this and my casual wanderings I know that I will be able to change the lives of people by showing them color for the very first time.

<h3>Random Acts Of Poetry: A Moving Movement </h3>
<p>Now more than ever, America needs healing. Hope. Creativity. Kindness. Poetry. </p>
<p>We need less arguing online. We need more connecting in person. Less hate. More love. Less nasty Tweets. More beautiful haiku. <br/><br/>I've been hand-writing and hand-delivering (and hiding) Random Acts Of Poetry all across America for seven years now. I've seen first-hand how acts of kindness, in the form of hand-written haiku (and sometimes longer-form poetry), can make people feel appreciated. Honored. Amused. Amazed. Yes, the little things can go a long way. And several times a day, I hear ""You just made my day."" But I'm not doing this just for me. Or just one random person along the way. Oh no. We <strong>ALL</strong> need this. Now. More than ever before, maybe. <br/><br/>There's a<strong> LOT</strong> of time and effort that goes into my poetic passion project. And I need <strong>YOU</strong> to help fund me. Help encourage me. Help me buy long-lasting pens. Quality custom index cards. Travel more. Reach out more. Connect. Deeper. I need you to help me share the love. Share the hope. Share the poetry. <br/><br/>(I'm also doing my personal best to keep handwriting alive and well and flowing...)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Help Me. I'll Help You. And Haiku You! </h3>
<p>Any and all funds received here will go towards my life mission and personal passion project – Random Acts Of Poetry. Over the pasts seven-plus years, I've hand-written, handed out and hidden at least 12,000 Random Acts Of Poetry. This effort and commitment takes time. Energy. Resources. Discipline. Dedication. And funding! Help me out here. And I'll help you – and haiku you. Donate to this noble, needed cause, and I'll gladly send you a custom, hand-written haiku in the mail. I can also send you poetry via social media or email. Your choice!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact Is REAL</h3>
<p>I'm doing my best to focus on the common thread and universal connections, wants, needs and hopes of us all here in America. It's not easy these days, but I know that via poetry, we can all reach some common ground. And via kindness, we can all remember that we're all here in this one place, together, pursuing common goals. We all want to feel love. Give love. Be <strong>PASSIONATE</strong> about something, or someone. Random Acts Of Poetry serve as hand-written reminders of our power and playful agitators of <strong>ACTION</strong> to make our lives, our society and our planet a better place for all of us to live, work, play, grow and connect in. </p>
<p>I often receive hugs from Random Acts Of Poetry. Sometimes, people cry a little bit. They often tell me, ""You just made my day."" Well, we all need to help make each other feel better right now, don't we? Help me help others, via the Peaceful <strong>POWER</strong> of Poetry. Help me help us all heal – at least a little bit. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Rewards &gt; Risks</h3>
<p>The rewards here far outweigh the risks. But there are real risks. I've been threatened, demeaned, made fun of, called names and kicked out of certain places for Random Acts Of Poetry over the years. You never know what you are getting into with people these days, and to reach out at random to imperfect strangers takes guts and guile and runs some risk, surely. Especially in an angry and armed society. I've done OK and I know how to protect myself. But I'd feel even more emboldened knowing I have sheer numbers backing me up!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways YOU Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you don't donate, you can help me and Random Acts Of Poetry by sharing the information and link to this project. Even if you don't do that, you can help us all by practicing kindness – and committing various Random Acts Of Kindness. Remember, we all get to choose our actions and reactions in this life and this world. It's not always easy to be kind, but it does always feel good. It doesn't even have to be all that creative – but by being kind, you're helping create a better, sweeter, sexier, gentler, more peaceful and productive place for us all to live in. So get out there and be kind to someone. Think about someone other than just you. Please. Thank you! </p>

<p><strong>OVERVIEW</strong></p>
<p>If you're a fan of Then She Fell, Queen of the Night and Sleep no More, you will definitely love INSIDE THE WILD HEART. Our upcoming play is a fully immersive theatrical experience which showcases the work of Clarice Lispector's, Brazil's most acclaimed female writer. Our vision is to create a sensory play that serves as an entry point to Clarice's incredible --yet still mostly unknown in the US-- work.</p>
<p><strong>INTRO</strong></p>
<p>Clarice Lispector (1920-1977) is Brazil's most acclaimed female writer. She was described  by researchers such as Iba Mendes and Benjamin Moser as the most important Jewish writer since Franz Kafka, with her trademark stream-of-consciousness writing style often being compared to that of Virginia Woolf and James Joyce. In fact, Clarice's Complete Stories was recognized among the best books of 2015 by the New York Times and the Boston Globe.</p>
<p>The underlying thread across Lispector’s work is the questioning of oneself and humanity. Her work is universal, transcending ethnicity, race, religion, time, gender and place. Many people say, and we agree, that you don’t just read Clarice, you experience it.</p>
<p>We believe that Clarice's amazing talent deserves to be shared beyond just Brazil. In a place as diverse and fast-paced as New York City, people deserve to have their hearts and minds touched by Clarice's incredible world view. This is how Inside the Wild Heart was born, an immersive theatrical experience to transport audiences directly inside Clarice Lispector’s heart, performed by the only Brazilian Theater Company in NYC.</p>
<p>Clarice used to say that ""all the world began with a yes."" And to turn Inside the Wild Heart into reality we need you to say ""yes"" too. Support us in making it happen! Your ""yes"" will be your key into the wonders of Clarice's heart.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT THE PLAY​</strong></p>
<p>INSIDE THE WILD HEART will be a site-specific, fully immersive and participatory theatrical experience. The performance will happen in a house setting where the audience will be able to walk freely from room to room following the performers and interacting with the environment​. Our vision is to create a show that encourages audiences to be active participants rather than passive spectators, and engage with literature on a sensorial level.</p>
<p><strong>ABOUT GROUP.BR</strong></p>
<p>We are a group of Brazilian artists who live in New York. As the only Brazilian Theater Company in the city, our mission is to bring Brazilian culture to New York stages through the performing arts. We use physical theater --where body movement is a form of communication-- as our main tool to expose the works of most renowned Brazilian artists. We provide audiences with a deeper, more nuanced exploration of Brazilian culture, beyond the familiar depictions of the country, as well as the unique opportunity to enjoy Brazilian dramaturgy and the musicality of the Portuguese language.</p>

<h3>ABOUT ""THE BIG SANDWICH THEATRE COMPANY""</h3>
<p>The concept of The Big Sandwich Theatre Company is the brain child of Randy Aronson, if not the actual name, which was forced upon him by the four other original troupe members. Randy's dreams included forming his own Santa Clarita acting troupe and casting who he wanted to work with in the productions. His inspirations included legendary melodramatic sketch comedy groups such as Low Moan Spectacular, Monty Python, Kentucky Fried Theatre, and, of course, the Carol Burnett Show.</p>
<p>Having directed most of this original group in previous productions, Randy had his first cast already in mind, including talented young actresses Tyler Joy and Sanya Arnold. Randy turned to entertainment jack of all trades Christopher Flowers, and well established playwright n' more Wade Bradford for help concieving the first production as well as developing the basics of The Big Sandwich as a company.</p>
<p>The trio brainstormed and improv'ed several ideas until finally settling on the groundwork that would become their first full length comedy ""Change the Station."" The authors then spent the next few months writing and rewriting the play, under their producer's supervision. With a finished script, a rented theatre, and a few more talented performers (with more patiently waiting in the wings!), The Big Sandwich was born.</p>
<p>Originally expected to be a ""one off"" experiment, those pesky troupe members kept filling Randy's mind with thoughts of rolling any successes from this first show, into a second, then a third, and so on. With some skill and a little luck, The Big Sandwich will hopefully serve up more of its hilarious hammy, cheesy goodness to L.A. County residents in a second show.</p>
<p>With your generous contribution, The Big Sandwich Theatre Company can launch a brand new world premiere production!</p>

My new piece, <b>Taxonomy 23 forms of encounter (memory, afterimages, histories): Displacement</b> is my largest art installation to date, custom designed for the Academy’s historical building in upper Manhattan.

</div></div>","What is the project about?This winter I was accepted to do an installation for the American Academy of Arts and Letters. My new piece, Taxonomy 23 forms of encounter (memory, afterimages, histories): Displacement is my largest art installation to date, custom designed for the Academy’s historical building in upper Manhattan. The sculpture is 12 feet high, and is an extremely detailed, mixed media composition that requires months of hard work on the part of a whole team of experienced artists to be completed.The piece is conceived as an extension of the Taxonomy project, a series I have been making for the last decade. In this latest elaboration, T-23 collects, even as it reconstructs, impressions of a space—taking into consideration the building’s architecture, historical roots, shifting spatial perspectives, and photographic / digital reinterpretations — making this ‘taxonomic’ collection tangible through mixed media. The materials used are large photographic papers, transparent fabrics, inks, wood and clay materials, cameras and projectors.
Who we are

I am a Brooklyn based multidisciplinary artist, and together with my wife, abstract painter, Marilyn Gold, I founded and run a framing business called Handmade Frames. I continually work with talented artists as collaborators and conspirators, giving younger artists an opportunity to do what they are passionate about and to be an integral part of my work. Whether I am employing sculptural, photographic or other mediums, my process rests on the belief that my artwork is an ‘author-less’ creation. I displace the construction and interpretation of my work to the realms of chance, memory, and the shifting relationships between a viewer and the piece. Please help co-construct this project; we invite you to be part of the collaborative fingerprint we leave in the Academy’s long and rich cultural history.
   What we need & what you get

With this project, we are spending much more than we are asking for, so any extra dollar will be used to support 11 freelance artist assistants, and fund the long list of materials needed to produce the piece. While the request for $20,000 is daunting to say the least, we expect the piece to cost a significant amount more, and raising this amount would help offset the costs we are paying out of pocket.
The production costs of this project have been and continue to be large. We are asking for help to fund amongst other costs:
Photographic prints requiring large paper and inks - $2,000
Cameras for time lapsing images - $3,000


Re-creation of space in my studio - $8,000 plus creation of parts of piece -$4000
Both creating in the studio and then installing the piece in the actual space with artist assistants, all fully paid - $5,000

Zdanowicz, a Chicago based writer and comic book enthusiast.  The two of us have been close friends since we first met at an art exhibit in 2013, immediately finding common ground in blurring the lines between 'high' and 'low' art.  Sharing a passion for narrative analysis and deconstruction, we've tossed around ideas related to reinvigorating various genres of art, and how we could make art more accessible to the public.<br/></p>
<p>Our first project will be a Pop Art Exhibition featuring the installation of a life sized comic, where each panel of the story is its own wall sized painting.  We'll be sharing the first part of a three issue narrative, ""La Revolución,"" a story about several unlikely protagonists who band together under the unified cause of revolting against a fictional totalitarian empire.  As an homage to the world of comics and illustration, our rotating cast of heroes are each designed to allude to various narrative tropes, giving our setting a familiar and nostalgic ambiance.  We've finally developed a plan and structure for what we hope is the first of many ambitious projects, but we need your help in taking our dream to the next level.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Incentives: What You Get</h3>
<p>As a gallery style art exhibition, we will be selling the work we produce.  It would be unfair for our contributing supporters to not be compensated for their good faith.  By donating to our project, you will have the first pick on our available works.  We will be promoting images of some of the art as they are produced, and we will be sharing non-public photos of completed works with contributors who are interested in selecting a piece to take home.  Though the art will be up for a month's time, selected works will be listed as NSA (not for sale), and will be reserved to those who donate.  The following is the incentive tier. <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>$30: Limited edition autographed graphic novel of La Revolución, or 1 small scale digital print</li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">$50: 2 small scale digital prints or 1 medium scale digital print</span></li>
<li>$100: One original extra small scale canvas painting (8x10 - 11x14)</li>
<li>$225: One original small scale canvas painting (12x16 - 16x20) </li>
<li>$350: One original small scale canvas painting (12-16 - 16x20) &amp; One extra small scale canvas painting (8x10 - 11x14).</li>
<li>$500: Original medium scale canvas painting (18x24, 20x20, 22x28)</li>
<li>$750: Original large scale canvas painting (24x30 - 24x36)</li>
<li>$1000: Original extra large scale canvas painting (36x48 in.)</li>
</ul>
<div>Please expect to receive the works around the beginning of August.  Additionally, contributors of $350 or more have the option of receiving an original commissioned painting instead of a work from the show from the artist of their choosing.  </div> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need:</h3> <p>We have a location and a date set for our first show, as well as enough supplies to give us some initial traction.  What we need now are funds to support the cost of materials and marketing.<br/><br/>MATERIALS:</p> <ul> <li>$500: Canvasses of varying sizes</li> <li>$750: Cost of artistic prints (Limited edition prints of digital work, and archival prints of paintings)<br/>
</li>
<li>$250: Budget for brushes, paints, inks, paper, pens, and pencils</li> </ul>
<div>While we have the tools and means of marketing ourselves through social media and print, we have an opportunity to set our goals high, so that we can grow and develop our project into a bi-annual release schedule divided into a pre-production and a post-production period.  To reach that goal, we would like to utilize the networks and audiences of established .</div>

Zdanowicz, a Chicago based writer and comic book enthusiast.  The two of us have been close friends since we first met at an art exhibit in 2013, immediately finding common ground in blurring the lines between 'high' and 'low' art.  Sharing a passion for narrative analysis and deconstruction, we've tossed around ideas related to reinvigorating various genres of art, and how we could make art more accessible to the public.
Our first project will be a Pop Art Exhibition featuring the installation of a life sized comic, where each panel of the story is its own wall sized painting.  We'll be sharing the first part of a three issue narrative, ""La Revolución,"" a story about several unlikely protagonists who band together under the unified cause of revolting against a fictional totalitarian empire.  As an homage to the world of comics and illustration, our rotating cast of heroes are each designed to allude to various narrative tropes, giving our setting a familiar and nostalgic ambiance.  We've finally developed a plan and structure for what we hope is the first of many ambitious projects, but we need your help in taking our dream to the next level.

Incentives: What You Get
As a gallery style art exhibition, we will be selling the work we produce.  It would be unfair for our contributing supporters to not be compensated for their good faith.  By donating to our project, you will have the first pick on our available works.  We will be promoting images of some of the art as they are produced, and we will be sharing non-public photos of completed works with contributors who are interested in selecting a piece to take home.  Though the art will be up for a month's time, selected works will be listed as NSA (not for sale), and will be reserved to those who donate.  The following is the incentive tier. 

$30: Limited edition autographed graphic novel of La Revolución, or 1 small scale digital print
$50: 2 small scale digital prints or 1 medium scale digital print
$100: One original extra small scale canvas painting (8x10 - 11x14)
$225: One original small scale canvas painting (12x16 - 16x20) 
$350: One original small scale canvas painting (12-16 - 16x20) & One extra small scale canvas painting (8x10 - 11x14).
$500: Original medium scale canvas painting (18x24, 20x20, 22x28)
$750: Original large scale canvas painting (24x30 - 24x36)
$1000: Original extra large scale canvas painting (36x48 in.)

Please expect to receive the works around the beginning of August.  Additionally, contributors of $350 or more have the option of receiving an original commissioned painting instead of a work from the show from the artist of their choosing.     What We Need: We have a location and a date set for our first show, as well as enough supplies to give us some initial traction.  What we need now are funds to support the cost of materials and marketing.MATERIALS:  $500: Canvasses of varying sizes $750: Cost of artistic prints (Limited edition prints of digital work, and archival prints of paintings)

$250: Budget for brushes, paints, inks, paper, pens, and pencils 
While we have the tools and means of marketing ourselves through social media and print, we have an opportunity to set our goals high, so that we can grow and develop our project into a bi-annual release schedule divided into a pre-production and a post-production period.  To reach that goal, we would like to utilize the networks and audiences of established .
MARKETING:


$300: Cost of prints for self marketing (fliers, post cards, collectibles)
$150: Budget for digital advertising space through social media
$250: Budget for digital and printed ad space through established blogs, and news outlets


ADDITIONAL EXPENSES:


$150: Estimated cost of two day truck rental during installation period
$100: Cost of installation supplies (marking tape, labels, wall print for gallery synopses)
$750: Budget for graphic novel print (The exhibition will be converted into a print sized comic for future distribution and promotion of subsequent volumes)
$300: 3 day space rental at upcoming Wizard World convention to further promote our concept

   The Impact Because we are collaborating our efforts from different backgrounds, we hope to revolutionize (sorry for the pun) and reinvigorate attitudes pertaining to both scenes.  We believe that art is constantly evolving, constantly reflecting the attitudes of the society it represents.  With the advent of technology, communication, and social media, we have strong beliefs pertaining to the idea that art of all backgrounds should be more accessible.     Risks & Challenges  We primarily have two large obstacles to overcome.  The first is a time constraint: this project demands a high volume of art to be produced.  To ensure an end result that matches our vision, we have developed a strict production schedule for ourselves and a number of artists that we have brought in to assist with the work load.  The second is a matter of marketing..  The growth of this project is dependent on an active community of supporters and fans.  Fortunately, Michael and I each have the skills to react to these hurdles.Project Development:I studied Studio Arts at the University of Illinois in Chicago, where the curriculum was primarily focused on project development and coordination.  I spent my first two years after college showing in and coordinating over twenty group art exhibitions while running a 6 person team at the Fulton Street Collective.  My latest project was a solo artist exhibition that saw a high volume of traffic, nearly selling out on opening night.  In three month's time, I was able to put together a cohesive vision for my show funded only by my savings.Marketing:Michael has been worked in sales for over five years, establishing a strong network and working rapport with prominent members of the illustration and comic book industry.  Michael will be using his experience along with my proficiency in Photoshop and Illustrator to reach out to our network, and to extend our reach eventually through continued promotion.

<p>Hello there!! I'm Ouma and I use cells as the theme of my art work. I used to be a vet. And as a vet it is in my the nature to heal hearts. In 2011 I started to use art to find the way to heal without operations or drugs. When I was a vet I was studying to be a pathologist to analyze cancer cells.

<b>Project Stipends</b>: This is very important for us. Each selected collaboration will receive a project stipend to cover creation costs, this can be for materials, artist pay, costumes, etc. We want to offer each project $500, if not more. This stipend gives the artists opportunity to create a fully visualized project. </li>

<b>Production</b>: Our great Production Manager, Joshue Bob Rose, is taking helm behind the scenes. He strives to create the most cost-effective and professional presentation, but there are hard costs associated with performance. We need audio and lighting equipment, proper dance floor, transportation, event rentals and crew to create the production set up these artists deserve. </li>
<li>
<b>Administrative Work</b>: The HG festival is in its first year so every small task is coming out-of-pocket, including filing for a nonprofit status, acquiring the right permits and promotional materials. We want to do everything the right way and that takes a little more spend. </li>

<p><b>What will an interconnected network of artists bring to the neighborhoods?</b></p>
<p>Let us introduce you to Washington Heights and Inwood neighborhoods. We are the tippy top, nose bleed section of the great theatre that is New York. Our sidewalks are a ruckus of bachata music, Dominican &amp; Russian food, doctors of Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital, Jewish traditions, two generation families on Saturday strolls, college students &amp; young professionals -- and a grand wave of artists.  </p>
<p>In the last decade, both communities have proven an inviting home to professional artists of NYC.  Residents of the neighborhood take the full spectrum of art careers, and it is felt throughout the streets from the urban art and instrument bearing A-train swingers, to the operatics resounding from the open windows of apartments. Many artists know each other in their fields but few find the opportunity to connect with other creators, especially those just next door.  And that is where Higher Ground Festival steps in-- it is time to unite the artists, and celebrate their talents through collaborations. Together we can establish Washington Heights and Inwood neighborhoods as art and cultural destinations in the city.   </p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DGih0mAxxMqk%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FGih0mAxxMqk&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;"">New Media Arts have the power to engage youth, awaken an abandoned love of the arts in a jaded elder, connect the general public to a world of creative thinking and innovative action.</span></h3>
<p></p>
<p>The artists that come to the Festival find collaborators for future projects, developers to help them manifest a once thought impossible vision, friendship and an opportunity to experience the Southwestern landscape that makes your mind open like a fan.</p>
<blockquote><span>Every year’s Festival is a new take on the Art/Technology world. The Festival focuses on how artists are using technology in an ever changing landscape of innovation and discovery.<br/></span></blockquote>
<p><b>We also have a strong youth focused commitment</b>. Through our Youth Media Makers Program we visit regional high schools giving the students the opportunity to see the latest in 21st Century art and offering them the chance to have their own work presented at the Festival. A first this year was a partnership with Youth Shelter's Access program for at risk youth. The teens attended once a week classes in May, taught by Little Globe staff, to familiarize them with AV equipment and then came on as paid interns at the Festival. They even created a wonderful video work that we presented. On top of these two programs we had over 200 youth from the City's Summer Camp Program and two other schools take guided tours of the main exhibition.<br/></p>
<p>Our local audience looks forward to this event every year. Out of town visitors experience the haunting juxtaposition of a rich indigenous culture that persists in the shadow of Los Alamos Labs all laced together at CURRENTS where the timeless drive of creativity melds technology with humanistic vision.</p>

Frank Ragano and Mariannah Amster launched the first CURRENTS as a small local show in 2002, in order to create a platform for video and New Media artists who had few options to show their work in Santa Fe, New Mexico. 
www.currentsnewmedia.org

What began with 8 local artists has grown into a dynamic festival that presents the work of over 100 artists, performers, programmers and scholars from all parts of the USA, and all continents of our beautiful globe. The 2016 Festival, which ran June 10-26, included, robotics, multimedia performance, interactive audio, new media and video installations, 3D printing, App and Web art, outdoor projections… and more. 
The CURRENTS festival has no cost of Admission, yeah, IT'S FREE.

Parallel Studios, a nonprofit 501 (c)(3) organization, raises money 
throughout the year in order to keep the Festival free for all and to 
continue to offer travel, shipping and lodging support for the artists who come to Santa Fe to install their work. This year the Festival covered these costs for 34 artists.
We strive, not only to keep the Festival free, but we are also proud to be able to give New Media artists an opportunity to create without the pressures of the Marketplace and to give voice to the 21st century in ways only these new creative tools allow. 
Everything, artists logistics, curation, bookkeeping, exhibition design, graphic design – everything) is done in house by Mariannah and Frank (the two founders and Co-Executive Directors) and Hannah Kramm (the Outreach+ Coordinator that keeps everything moving forward). Our small working board is made up of artists, tech heads, dreamers, and philanthropists (who don’t hesitate to get their hands dirty when it’s time to install) with diverse ethnicities and backgrounds.

   Why Are We Running This Campaign?

Running a festival of this scale is expensive, and each year as we continue to grow so do the costs of production. 
Over the years we have been fortunate to be able to keep up with expenses through grant writing, which is still the foundation of our funding. We’re turning to you, our art loving/believing crowd to help us get through this year’s expanded demands in housing and shipping expenditures. 

We are running this campaign for $15,000 to help cover the cost of travel and lodging for our 34 artists that came from out of state/country to be here at this festival that they make amazing. (plus our awesome interns!)  


Rental for our exhibition venues goes up every year, this year – $13,500.




Total costs of travel, accommodation and shipping for artists this year -  $30,000.
And then there are costs for production supplies, scissor lift rentals, wifi, craft services and much more -$50,000.
Then, of course, there is advertising, insurance, admin salaries and on and on.

   Why This is Important
New Media Arts have the power to engage youth, awaken an abandoned love of the arts in a jaded elder, connect the general public to a world of creative thinking and innovative action.

The artists that come to the Festival find collaborators for future projects, developers to help them manifest a once thought impossible vision, friendship and an opportunity to experience the Southwestern landscape that makes your mind open like a fan.
Every year’s Festival is a new take on the Art/Technology world. The Festival focuses on how artists are using technology in an ever changing landscape of innovation and discovery.
We also have a strong youth focused commitment. Through our Youth Media Makers Program we visit regional high schools giving the students the opportunity to see the latest in 21st Century art and offering them the chance to have their own work presented at the Festival.

<h3>My Story</h3> <p>After several years of producing fine art for Disney and other big companies, I've decided to follow my passion and combine my love of art with my love of sports.  Becoming an MLB licensed artist has been a dream come true, but starting up this business has been a costly one.  Between the licensing fees, printing costs and the whopping price of admission just to get into a venue to sell my pieces, it has been a bit overwhelming.  My passion is capturing former, current and future legends of baseball with a vintage vibe that reminds us of the good old days of America's favorite pastime. Your support can help me finally overcome the financial hurdle of starting this new business and allow me to bring my artwork to a vibrant city with endless possibilities.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hi, my name's Lisa Frost, I live in the beautiful Hinterland of the Gold Coast, Australia, and I create fine art landscape photography and poetry. My goal as an artist is to uplift and bring joy. I aim for my art to enhance the viewer's connection with nature and spirit, bringing them a sense of peace and space.p</p>
<p>Exhibiting my art has been on hold for a few years as other aspects of my life have taken priority, so I am just itching to get back out and share my work again! It starts with taking part in the Artyzan Fair being held on the Gold Coast in October where I'm putting together a collection of some of my best photographs I've entitled, ""Serenity: Our World at Peace"". </p>
<p>Because it has been awhile I am basically starting from scratch, and printing and framing is not a cheap endeavour, which is why I need your help! And I thought what better way to raise funds than by offering prints from the exhibition at a discounted rate, as well as my lovely little gift book, ""Love This Moment"", which makes an awesome Christmas present!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h2>My Objective</h2>
<p>I am passionate about creating art that is peaceful and beautiful and allows people to forget all about the one-hundred-and-one things normally going around in their head and instead get transported to a distant and tranquil place. This is my vision for the ""Serenity"" exhibition, which will give me the start I need to once again be sharing my work more regularly.</p>
<p>I have spent a great many hours searching for the most beautiful and impactful ways of displaying my images, and have definitely found them in metallic prints framed or acrylic facemounted. And whilst the results are breath-taking they are also expensive...that's why I need your help!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Your Contribution</h2>
<p>Your contribution towards this campaign is crucial, as the majority of funds raised will be going towards creating the prints for the exhibition. I am planning on having all the prints available as Master-Sized Unframed Prints (see below for an explanation of sizes), as well as a selection of Framed Prints and Framed Poetry: how many will depend on how much money is raised.</p>
<p>Ideally I'd also love to have a couple of Acrylic Facemounts on display as they are truly amazing! If we reach my goal then we can do this!!</p>
<p>A small portion of funds raised will also be going towards some display items (backdrops, tablecloths, art stands etc). Reaching my funding goal will mean I can purchase some decent lighting, which will make a big difference to just how wonderful this exhibition will look!</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h2>What You Receive!</h2>
<p>When you contribute to this campaign you will receive a beautiful piece of art in return. An explanation of the different types available can be found below, along with all the images and poems included in the ""Serenity"" exhibition for you to choose from!<br/> </p>
<h3>Love This Moment Book</h3>
<p>""Love This Moment"" is a simple and inspiring poem about finding true joy in life. Accompanied by 21 landscape photographs from earlier in my career, it is uplifting and life-affirming. The book also contains the moving story of what inspired me to write Love This Moment. With Christmas fast approaching it makes the perfect gift for family and friends!</p>

<p>Your choice of one of my photographs from the ""Serenity"" exhibition to be printed on Kodak Professional Endura Premier Metallic paper, then framed in your choice of either a mocha or white modern frame using only acid-free products for superior archival quality. I use high-grade acrylic instead of glass as it is very clear, lighter than glass and much harder to break! </p>
<p>The white frame uses a double-matte with matching inner and outer mattes.</p>

</div></div>","Introduction
Hi, my name's Lisa Frost, I live in the beautiful Hinterland of the Gold Coast, Australia, and I create fine art landscape photography and poetry. My goal as an artist is to uplift and bring joy. I aim for my art to enhance the viewer's connection with nature and spirit, bringing them a sense of peace and space.p
Exhibiting my art has been on hold for a few years as other aspects of my life have taken priority, so I am just itching to get back out and share my work again! It starts with taking part in the Artyzan Fair being held on the Gold Coast in October where I'm putting together a collection of some of my best photographs I've entitled, ""Serenity: Our World at Peace"". 
Because it has been awhile I am basically starting from scratch, and printing and framing is not a cheap endeavour, which is why I need your help! And I thought what better way to raise funds than by offering prints from the exhibition at a discounted rate, as well as my lovely little gift book, ""Love This Moment"", which makes an awesome Christmas present!
 

My Objective
I am passionate about creating art that is peaceful and beautiful and allows people to forget all about the one-hundred-and-one things normally going around in their head and instead get transported to a distant and tranquil place. This is my vision for the ""Serenity"" exhibition, which will give me the start I need to once again be sharing my work more regularly.
I have spent a great many hours searching for the most beautiful and impactful ways of displaying my images, and have definitely found them in metallic prints framed or acrylic facemounted. And whilst the results are breath-taking they are also expensive...that's why I need your help!
 
Your Contribution
Your contribution towards this campaign is crucial, as the majority of funds raised will be going towards creating the prints for the exhibition. I am planning on having all the prints available as Master-Sized Unframed Prints (see below for an explanation of sizes), as well as a selection of Framed Prints and Framed Poetry: how many will depend on how much money is raised.
Ideally I'd also love to have a couple of Acrylic Facemounts on display as they are truly amazing! If we reach my goal then we can do this!!
A small portion of funds raised will also be going towards some display items (backdrops, tablecloths, art stands etc). Reaching my funding goal will mean I can purchase some decent lighting, which will make a big difference to just how wonderful this exhibition will look!

 
What You Receive!
When you contribute to this campaign you will receive a beautiful piece of art in return. An explanation of the different types available can be found below, along with all the images and poems included in the ""Serenity"" exhibition for you to choose from! 
Love This Moment Book
""Love This Moment"" is a simple and inspiring poem about finding true joy in life. Accompanied by 21 landscape photographs from earlier in my career, it is uplifting and life-affirming. The book also contains the moving story of what inspired me to write Love This Moment. With Christmas fast approaching it makes the perfect gift for family and friends!
 
Framed Poetry
Your choice of one of my poems from the ""Serenity"" exhibition, printed on Fuji Crystal Archive paper then matted and framed in an elegant white matte and frame. The frame is 8x10"" while the print is 6x8"". 

Further down the page are all the poems you can choose from. After you've chosen this perk I will email you asking which poem you'd like.
Unframed Prints
Your choice of one of my photographs from the ""Serenity"" exhibition printed on Kodak Professional Endura Premier Metallic paper. This paper has amazing vibrancy and depth, making it feel like you're almost there in the photo! It also has excellent archival qualities, being resistant to fading for 100 years in the typical home environment. 
Sizes

Framed Prints
Your choice of one of my photographs from the ""Serenity"" exhibition to be printed on Kodak Professional Endura Premier Metallic paper, then framed in your choice of either a mocha or white modern frame using only acid-free products for superior archival quality. I use high-grade acrylic instead of glass as it is very clear, lighter than glass and much harder to break! 
The white frame uses a double-matte with matching inner and outer mattes.

The mocha frame uses a double-matte consisting of a sand coloured outer matte and off-white inner matte.

Sizes
All perks are listed using a size name. See the table below for the actual size of the print and frame you choose.

You choose one of my photographs from the ""Serenity"" exhibition to be printed on fine art metallic paper, which is then facemounted onto a polished sheet of high-grade acrylic, giving it an almost magical luminescence. Acrylic Facemounts have a definite WOW factor!
Sizes
All perks are listed using a size name. See the table below for the actual size of the acrylic facemount you choose.

See below for all the images in the ""Serenity"" exhibition you can choose from. After you've chosen one of these perks I will email you asking which image you'd like.

<h3>Shifting Gears: Small Business to Community Arts Center  </h3>
<p>Two years ago, my family and I took a giant leap as we decided it was best for me to have a more flexible schedule while our children were young. I'm a mother of triplet boys who just turned 5 and I've been a K-5 Visual Art Educator for the past 10 years. Between the cost of childcare and the extensive appointment schedule I was maintaining for our special needs son, the regular full time working schedule was not serving our family well. Created to Grow was born as a labor of love and leap of faith and we are at a crossroads. Our goal from the start was to begin a business that could fund and support a non-profit to serve the community through the arts. As we look at our position as a business we are at a turning point of sorts and we need your help to flip the switch on the second chapter in Created to Grow's story.<br/><br/>The business itself operates at about 50% capacity and we know there are many people in our community that could use these services and, with that, the first goal of the non-profit version of Created to Grow will be to support and fund a scholarship program. In addition to the scholarship  program, I hope to offer teen safe haven after school programs, free or reduced cost art therapy programs, and have more flexibility to donate programming at local community events. Your donation today will help us become more than a small business and be a part of building the non profit phase of Created to Grow Community Arts Center. </p>
<p>During that last year of teaching, when the boys were 2 years old, I was fortunate enough to spend time in San Diego for the National Art Educators Association Conference and learn about an incredible community resource call ARTS: A Reason To Survive. This organization partners professional artists with homeless youth and families and provides a safe haven of creative endeavors during the between school and bedtime hours. To  say I was inspired would be a huge understatement. I wanted this here for my students, for our community. </p>
<p>The process of starting a non-profit was not something within reach given the time and financial constraints that were on my plate, but as I wrapped up the school year, this ""missing resource"" in our neighborhood dug into me. We live just outside the heart of the arts district in NE Minneapolis and yet, there was no arts specific organization serving our youth and families. I had two big weights on my shoulders. One was personal, how we were going to manage the following years losing my income to childcare and balancing all of the needs of not only three toddlers, but one with significant special needs. The other was ideological, I now had the knowledge of this missing piece for our community and, in many ways, the educational and professional background to make it happen, I already felt like it was my job to plant the seed. </p>
<p>I attended some small business classes and decided to start small, with a business model and build it to profitability during the leave of absence that I would have from my traditional teaching career.  Created to Grow was born as a small business providing classes, open studio hours, after school programs and special events. The idea was build a business to fund the non-profit and then head back to my teaching career in 3-5 years. Well two years have passed and 3 will be here before we know it and we have some very big decisions to make. I've created this Indiegogo campaign to put it in the communities' hands. </p>
<p>This is where I get brutally honest about where we stand as a business. Probably more honest than is recommended, but if I'm going to donate to something I want to know exactly why the need is there and how the donation will be used and you deserve that same honesty from me when you are considering donating. </p>
<p>In the grand scheme of things Created to Grow is doing fairly well. We are a business that still has its doors open 2 years in, which many statistics say is rare. Some months we break even, but we are, of course still working to pay off the initial investment of getting the doors open and our good months are not yet consistent. We are growing and have a strong base of clientele that are loyal to our programs and our community has become like a little family. People that come, come back and bring friends. As I stated earlier, we are now operating at about 50% capacity which is enough to continue as a business, but not enough to support the launch of the non-profits </p>
<p>In February, I have to tell my school whether I'll be back to teach in the fall. Given 3 years without my income while investing in a small business, I have to go back. We don't have any more time as a family to live in this kind of debt, there is a limit on how long we can live under the financial stress that comes with a new business.</p>
<p>In October of 2017, our lease is up. Does Created to Grow stay in our space, move to a new space, become a business without a specific location or simply close our doors. This is the hardest part for me to wrap my head around. I need to go back to my teaching job, but we haven't reached the point where employees are feasible, meaning the thing that makes the most sense is to simply close the doors or become a mobile business; maintain the name without the space so that it could be an on the side income. These options feel crushing. The literal blood, sweat and tears in this little studio feel like a horrible shame to walk away  from, but the hardest part is walking away from the people. My incredible families that walk in the door and create with me every day. The stories they tell, the love they share and the growth I've witnessed are so important to me. How can I take that away from the community? </p>
<p>With that I decided to look at the plan, spend some time reflecting and I've come to this place. I would love to see Created to Grow continue, I want this studio to grow and, more than anything, I want it to be able to form that non-profit that supports the arts for all of our community members, not just those that can afford our classes and parties. The original plan had three parts.  Opening and running as a solo employee business for 1-3 years, return to teaching while hiring a manager/teachers to sustain the studio and reaching profitability at 5-7 years. At that stage, we flip the switch build a board and turn business to non-profit. Maintaining the programs that make money to develop programs that serve. </p>
<p>So here we sit, a small business at a crossroads. We could very well continue to grow enough to be at the hiring stage we need to be to continue on this path while I return to my teaching career next fall, but it is feeling unlikely and with that I decided to see if we could jump a step. This campaign supports the launch of the Created to Grow Community Arts Center. Read on to see the specific ways that these funds will be put to use. So many helped to launch our phase one and so many support our business each day, I hope to see you support the next phase. Keep our Creative Space in the neighborhood and help us not only continue to provide the high quality creative education you've come to expect from our programs, but also to serve the whole community to provide our programs to our friends and neighbors who may not otherwise have the chance to participate in the creative programs we offer. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What I am hoping to do with this campaign is tie up the loose ends of some of the initial business expenses that are holding us back from stepping beyond the break even point and into the place where we can pay employees. The campaign will also support the legal fees of hiring an attorney and tax accountant to assist in our shift in status from business to non-profit. Any leftover funds will go towards to supply orders and scholarship funds for our existing programs so children that can not afford to participate are able. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>While Created to Grow will continue to offer the incredible classes and special events we already do, we will add the following features to our programming to serve the community:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scholarship Programs for our current arts classes, open studios and camps</li>
<li>Build a Teen Safehaven Arts Space with mentors for youth who need a safe and productive space to spend their afternoon. </li>
<li>Provide Art Therapy Group Programs on a freewill donation basis. </li>
<li>Provide Low Cost Creative Programming around the Neighborhood at events like the Farmers Market, Art-a-whirl, Eastside Neighborhood Services and other local events. <br/> </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This business has not been without its challenges. As I said before, it is growing, but not at the rate needed for us to sustain in beyond my return to teaching. Our biggest challenge right now is filling the classes and workshops and, as a non-profit, this would be critical to maintain the programming.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand not everyone can get behind us financially, but you can certainly think of us when you clean out your crafting spaces at home. Helping us spread the word is extremely helpful to our cause. </p>
<ul>
<li>New and used supply donations art takes materials:<br/>-new markers, crayons, colored pencils, glue, mod podge, paints (ask for preferred brands) puff balls, google eyes, feathers, sequins, etc. really if you can make something with it we will use it. </li>
<li>Used or Upcycling Materials: Cereal boxes, Birchbox boxes, fabric, yarn, spools, buttons, frames, scrapbook paper, old calendars and magazines, children's books, jars of various shapes and sizes. </li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools and help us spread the word, encourage family and friends to support the work we do. </li>
</ul>

What I am hoping to do with this campaign is tie up the loose ends of some of the initial business expenses that are holding us back from stepping beyond the break even point and into the place where we can pay employees. The campaign will also support the legal fees of hiring an attorney and tax accountant to assist in our shift in status from business to non-profit. Any leftover funds will go towards to supply orders and scholarship funds for our existing programs so children that can not afford to participate are able. 

The Impact
While Created to Grow will continue to offer the incredible classes and special events we already do, we will add the following features to our programming to serve the community:

Scholarship Programs for our current arts classes, open studios and camps
Build a Teen Safehaven Arts Space with mentors for youth who need a safe and productive space to spend their afternoon. 
Provide Art Therapy Group Programs on a freewill donation basis. 
Provide Low Cost Creative Programming around the Neighborhood at events like the Farmers Market, Art-a-whirl, Eastside Neighborhood Services and other local events.  


Risks & Challenges
This business has not been without its challenges. As I said before, it is growing, but not at the rate needed for us to sustain in beyond my return to teaching. Our biggest challenge right now is filling the classes and workshops and, as a non-profit, this would be critical to maintain the programming.  

Other Ways You Can Help
We understand not everyone can get behind us financially, but you can certainly think of us when you clean out your crafting spaces at home. Helping us spread the word is extremely helpful to our cause. 

New and used supply donations art takes materials:-new markers, crayons, colored pencils, glue, mod podge, paints (ask for preferred brands) puff balls, google eyes, feathers, sequins, etc. really if you can make something with it we will use it. 
Used or Upcycling Materials: Cereal boxes, Birchbox boxes, fabric, yarn, spools, buttons, frames, scrapbook paper, old calendars and magazines, children's books, jars of various shapes and sizes. 
Use the Indiegogo share tools and help us spread the word, encourage family and friends to support the work we do.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</div></div>","Short Summary 
On the 4th February 1945, Esther Brunstein was among a group of women forced to walk 
from a slave labour camp near Hanover to the Nazi death camp at Bergen-Belsen. They had survived the ghettos, the death camp at Auschwitz and months of hard labour in appalling conditions. They walked through the night. People died or were killed on 
the way. Esther lived to tell the story. These death marches were a part of the horror of the Holocaust:




 Esther Brunstein
This
 appeal is is to help realise and network the final phase of the Honouring Esther project: walking 
the actual route of the Nazi death march that Esther Brunstein survived.Honouring Esther was launched as part of Holocaust Memorial Day in Bristol in 
January 2015; the first walk took place in April on the 70th anniversary of the 
liberation of the Bergen-Belsen death camp. 

The project concludes in Germany with a two day walk: 4th/5th February 2016. 71 years later we will retrace Esther's steps, bearing witness, expressing solidarity with all refugees, using our creativity to connect the past with the present. 

Lead Artists: Richard White and Lorna Brunstein




""We
 are bringing an element of the story of the Holocaust into our times 
and into our world.  We believe this is a timely project: it is already 
generating many poignant resonances and with your support we can 
multiply and amplify them""

Lorna is the daughter of Holocaust survivors, Esther Brunstein is her mother. Lorna's art work concerning identity and inherited trauma draws on that second generation experience. 

Richard is a walking artist experimenting with digital media to explore and reveal hidden heritage: 
""Lorna and I have collaborated on several creative projects in the past. Honouring Esther combines the passion of both our interests. From the outset this project has been about human rights, exile and inheritance. Esther holds strong views on human rights and internationalism and in many ways it was that spirit which kept her alive and enabled her to live her life in post war Europe. We are acting in that spirit.""




""In
 April 2015 we walked the route of the death march Esther survived, 
transposed to Somerset, where we live.  We invited others to join us on 
foot and online. Together we co-created themed stopping points where the
 actual walk crossed the transposed line of the death march, the 
‘stations’ of our walk.""The walk will remind us that
 a refugee’s journey continues until they find safety and a welcome and a
 sense of belonging. For many it is a life long search. In the end we 
are all migrants and we all need safety, security, love and friendship.

    The Impact
This final phase, if fully funded, offers a way for people in the localities and worldwide to engage in a powerfully delivered story from the Holocaust, making connections into the current refugee crisis. With your support, an historical experience of persecution, displacement and exile will be shared, articulated and connected to the present. It will be a significant step in making real the slogan ‘refugees welcome’, expressing and demonstrating empathy of the long journey to safety and security. We hope that those we connect with, especially in the UK, will feel inspired by Esther’s spirit of humanitarian internationalism and welcome all refugees as they reach safety. This is the impact your support will help us achieve.
We will:


do the walk and network the experience live;


connect with organisations and individuals in the locality of the walk: refugee hosts, second and third generation survivors, liberators, perpetrators and witnesses;


document the walk and share the experience on completion;


create new links with schools, colleges and multifaith communities;

develop new artwork.

In Germany in 2016 we will bear witness again to the Holocaust and to a specific death march but, more than that, we are making it resonate with our lives now.
We will consult the walkers and all those associated with it on the impact of the project and produce a report. We approach the final
 phase with enthusiasm and confidence. Feedback from the walk in Somerset has been extremely positive:
“Powerful, moving and highly engaging in content and format. The importance of finding innovative approaches to creating work on this subject clearly cannot be underestimated”

<p>Coming back home to Oakland, CA from Burning Man 2015, the <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/lovepotion.tranceporterii"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Amphora art car</a>’s engine overheated, seized, and cracked, so the poor bus has been held captive in the Sierra foothills until the engine can be replaced! Without a new engine, the Amphora can’t return to Burning Man in 2016 for its 5th year in Black Rock City!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/YiwPCI5.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>The Amphora art car, made by Love Potion Camp, is a 24’ school bus surrounded by a huge bottle of swirling love potion, made from 7200 programmable LEDs mounted to an aluminum frame and diffused with panels of Rowlux (a multi-lensed effect film). The fur-lined downstairs is a cozy lounge, while a ladder in the rear leads to the upstairs dance floor.</p><p>We miss you, Black Rock City, and we’re REALLY going to miss you if we can’t fund these repairs.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We’re planning to get a fully-refurbished engine so we can avoid any future engine problems! At a minimum, the engine replacement will cost $10k, including parts/labor/taxes/warranty. </p><p>However, this amount ONLY covers the engine of the bus. We also want to revamp the art car to bring more glowing interactivity to BRC! Our funding goals are as follows:</p><ul>
<li><p><b>+$10000</b>: Replace the engine and bring Amphora back to Oakland. We’ll be able to bring her back to Burning Man in 2016 and share her with our local Burner community in the Bay Area.</p></li>
<li><p><b>+ $1000</b>: STRETCH GOAL Repair “back patio”. The wood cladding on the Amphora had to be broken and torn off in order to tow the bus to the mechanic; without rebuilding, there is no way to go upstairs.</p></li>
<li><p><b>+ $300</b>: STRETCH GOAL Fresh paint job. The faux-wood finish is faded and stained, and the rebuilt back patio will need to be painted; let’s get Amphora looking new again!</p></li>
<li><p><b>+ $700</b>: STRETCH GOAL More lights! The neck of the bottle has space for 800 more lights; we’ll need to reconfigure our existing lights to incorporate the new ones and power them up.</p></li>
<li><p><b>+ $1500</b>: STRETCH GOAL Extended interactivity. We can add live video, sound-driven pattern generation, and hands-free Leap Motion control!</p></li>
<li><p><b>+ $2000</b>: STRETCH GOAL New Rowlux diffusion film. This trippy plastic looks beautiful, but breaks <i>very</i> easily. We've devised a new way to work with this material to last longer while still looking awesome, but at $3/sq ft, this stuff isn't cheap!</p></li>
<li><p><b>+ $$$</b>: Anything extra from this campaign will be used to help cover the cost of storing and maintaining the Amphora </p></li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Love Potion has been bringing art and art cars to the playa since 2006, providing enjoyment and rides for hundreds of participants. Without an art car permit in 2015, we were unable to do our thing at full capacity, and we miss you! We want to see you again, this time for everyone and every night! In supporting the Amphora, you are supporting the greater Burning Man community, by giving us more ways to bring art and interactivity to Black Rock City and beyond.</p>
<p>Back at home in Oakland, CA, Love Potion maintains a community makerspace, <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/lovepotioncollective"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Love Potion Collective</a>, where members can learn new skills and use a wide variety of tools and equipment to make their projects come to life. Love Potion also promotes year-round Burning Man community through hosting burner socials, gallery shows, and interactive art/music events.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Share this campaign on social media and get the word out! Are you a fan of LED lights and/or art cars? Let your peers in these networks know that the Amphora needs their help! The more people who share this page, the more likely we are to reach our goal.</p>
<h4>Don’t forget to use Indiegogo’s share tools</h4>

Coming back home to Oakland, CA from Burning Man 2015, the Amphora art car’s engine overheated, seized, and cracked, so the poor bus has been held captive in the Sierra foothills until the engine can be replaced! Without a new engine, the Amphora can’t return to Burning Man in 2016 for its 5th year in Black Rock City!The Amphora art car, made by Love Potion Camp, is a 24’ school bus surrounded by a huge bottle of swirling love potion, made from 7200 programmable LEDs mounted to an aluminum frame and diffused with panels of Rowlux (a multi-lensed effect film). The fur-lined downstairs is a cozy lounge, while a ladder in the rear leads to the upstairs dance floor.We miss you, Black Rock City, and we’re REALLY going to miss you if we can’t fund these repairs.
What We Need
We’re planning to get a fully-refurbished engine so we can avoid any future engine problems! At a minimum, the engine replacement will cost $10k, including parts/labor/taxes/warranty. However, this amount ONLY covers the engine of the bus. We also want to revamp the art car to bring more glowing interactivity to BRC! Our funding goals are as follows:
+$10000: Replace the engine and bring Amphora back to Oakland. We’ll be able to bring her back to Burning Man in 2016 and share her with our local Burner community in the Bay Area.
+ $1000: STRETCH GOAL Repair “back patio”. The wood cladding on the Amphora had to be broken and torn off in order to tow the bus to the mechanic; without rebuilding, there is no way to go upstairs.
+ $300: STRETCH GOAL Fresh paint job. The faux-wood finish is faded and stained, and the rebuilt back patio will need to be painted; let’s get Amphora looking new again!
+ $700: STRETCH GOAL More lights! The neck of the bottle has space for 800 more lights; we’ll need to reconfigure our existing lights to incorporate the new ones and power them up.
+ $1500: STRETCH GOAL Extended interactivity. We can add live video, sound-driven pattern generation, and hands-free Leap Motion control!
+ $2000: STRETCH GOAL New Rowlux diffusion film. This trippy plastic looks beautiful, but breaks very easily. We've devised a new way to work with this material to last longer while still looking awesome, but at $3/sq ft, this stuff isn't cheap!
+ $$$: Anything extra from this campaign will be used to help cover the cost of storing and maintaining the Amphora 


What You Get
What do you get in return for your help? In addition to cool perks like glow-in-the-dark Amphora t-shirts, Love Potion paddles, and uv-reactive Love Potion necklaces, Love Potion is going to leverage our alternate identity as a public makerspace to offer perks like classes (see below), rental space (for meetings, events, or private parties), and membership to our shop! All mailable perks will also come with an Amphora sticker.

<h1>A Poet Innocently Turned to Painting</h1>
<p>I am a lifelong
resident of Massachusetts. I
have degrees from Franconia College and Lesley University.</p>
<p>Since high
school, I have been writing creatively, largely poetry. I have
published three books of poetry, as well as in magazines and on
websites. When I returned to school to finish the degree begun long
ago, I decided to use painting as my entry point for my study
of creativity. I had no previous experience in art beyond doodling in
notebooks. Technique developed as colour and brushstroke coalesced
into image. It has been an adventure learning a new form of
expression.</p>
<p>We are all artists when we are young. We sing, we
paint, we dance, carelessly, and with joy. As I created these visual
images, I let the child in me take over. My aim is that those who see
my work will become similarly inspired. The world is too full of
misery not to make the effort to bring energy and light and joy to
the world.</p>
<p>This May will see the first public showing of my
work. My campaign will fund the creation of prints of my paintings.
The main use of funding will be to make scans of eight paintings then
print a run of twenty copies of each. The rest of the funding would
pay for shipping perks to contributors.</p>
<p>I checked local printers who do art quality
scanning and printing. The company that won me let me speak directly with the person who would do the work. Scans cost $125 a-piece. That price includes proof copies to make sure the scan is as I want it).
Printing is around $18 a print. Turnover is a matter of days.</p>
<p>For perks, I will hand write a thank you to
everyone who contributes. I thank you right now for reading this far.
Those who contribute $35 will also receive a drawing by my hand.
Contributions of $75 will receive one of my prints. Contributions of
$500 will receive all eight prints. Contributions of $1750 will
receive all eight prints framed. All contributors will be publicly
thanked on Facebook (unless you choose otherwise).</p>
<p>If I don’t reach my goal then I will use the
funds to print what I can. If I exceed my goal, I will have the nature photographs that I have taken scanned and printed.</p>
<h1>My History</h1>
<p>As a poet, I understand the nether world of
publishing. Over the years, I have bought books and gave donations to
small presses as a way of support. Later I served as editor for Potes
&amp; Poets Press, a worthwhile but negatively remunerative venture.
My wife and I ran the Press for five years. During that time, we
published thirty books, despite extremely untimely payments from our
distributor. Profits from each book went to publishing the next.</p>
<p>I envision no extra costs. The showing will last one
month. Such prints that remain after the showing will be  taken to
gift shops and other likely markets in the area,</p>

Mixing means, mediums and collaborators are important features of her painting style and creative identity as seen in her body of works. </p><p>This publication is presented as a progressive catalogue of Yeo Shih Yun's art works over the years, interspersed with accounts by the people she has met along the way—gallerists, curators, friends and fellow artists alike. It is only through reading their essays does the chaos emerge into order, with the randomness of collective memories offering new angles, multi-layered dimensions and deeper connecting vibrations to Shih Yun's art.</p><p><i><strong>I wish to dedicate this monograph to my mum, who planted that tiny seed of art in me when I was young by bringing me to art lessons. </strong></i></p><h2> </h2><h3>The Beginning</h3><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">As a child growing up, my mum encouraged me to do whatever interested me. By age 5, I already knew that art would be my favourite and deeply important part of my world. In spite of my deepest desires to be immersed in creating art very early on in my life, I did not get to embark on any formal art training until in my early twenties -  compelled by the practical concerns of life and for my mum's peace of mind, I had to complete my Business degree course from NUS before I could get myself enrolled in LASALLE College of the Arts to finally pursue my true passion. At that time my decision was frowned upon and appeared to puzzle many, but I knew without a doubt that art was absolutely to be the epicentre of my core and calling for life. I could not imagine anything else.</span></p><div style=""text-align: justify;"">
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">A pivotal moment during my time at LASALLE was the <a href=""http://www.uobpoy.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">UOB painting competition</a> where I came in the top 20 for highly-commended works. Subsequently my painting, which was titled <i>Bamboo</i> was put on display at the UOB Plaza. Little did I know then that my painting would catch the eye of an expat couple, and it was soon sold at $1,500, a whopping sum at that time for a struggling artist. That someone would connect with my painting enough to want to have wanted to own it really sent me over the moon! I could finally catch that glimpse of hope that I could have a real shot at making art my career and possibly having the means to fund my lifelong passion if I could give it my all. </span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I knew</span><span style=""background-color: initial;""> my next step was to refine my skills at the <a href=""http://www.sfai.edu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">San Francisco Art Institute</a>. However, my </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">mother who raised me on her own, was reluctant to let me go to the far away Western hemisphere. It was after relentless persuasion, and I was elated when she finally gave me the nod. That I could get to study fine arts in the USA full-time opened my mind by a quantum leap to a whole new level of art consciousness!</span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Eventually, I came back to Singapore in 2002 and started off with teaching art to children while doing freelance design work. The following year, I had my first group show at the MICA building curated by Marjorie Chu of </span><a href=""http://artforum.com.sg/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""background-color: initial;"" target=""_blank"">Art Forum Gallery</a><span style=""background-color: initial;"">. I will always remember and be thankful for Marjorie's critique and pointers for me in those early days as a professional artist. I felt strongly about connecting fellow artists and bridging artistic collaborations, and so in 2004 I founded <a href=""http://Instinc.com/global/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>INSTINC</u></a> </span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">and the rest is history.</span></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: left;"">Biography of Yeo Shih Yun</h3>
<p>Born in Singapore 1976, Shih Yun is a full-time artist and Director of INSTINC, an independent artist-run space. She received her Bachelor of Business Administration(Marketing) from National University of Singapore, Diploma in Communications Design from Lasalle College of the Arts and Post- Baccalaureate (Painting) from San Francisco Art Institute in 2002.</p>
<p>Yeo Shih Yun is known to reinterpret the very act of ink painting with striking results. Her experimentations of fusing the traditional form with contemporary mediums like new media or performance art has garnered much acclaim, including a commission by the Singapore Art Museum, winning the Sovereign Asian Art Prize People's Choice Award in 2012 and being awarded a Certificate of Distinction and Highly Commended Entry at the UOB Painting of the Year Competition in 2007. Her painting at the Sovereign Asian Art Prize was auctioned by Christie’s Asia in 2012. Her recent exhibition was in NUS MUSEUM titled ""Scholars and ink"". </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: left;"">Why do I want to make this monograph?</h3>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Digital files and stuff get lost all the time, and I have ever lost all my files previously when my hard disk crashed. Although we have digital clouds, ebooks and all, a physical book, just like a painting in some ways, is much more personal and ideal when it comes to documenting cherished memories and artworks. Even if all my hard disks are to crash and all my artworks are lost, this book would be a record of my artistic career from 2000 till 2017. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">I had released my first book documenting my artworks in 2006, which I self-designed to save costs. More than 10 years have passed since then, and I have come to an inflection point of my art journey to take stock and look back at a transformative chapter of my life as I reach for my next one. This time however, I feel that it is important to get the best in the field to do what they are best at, hence I am working with Kelley Cheng(<a href=""http://www.thepressroom.com.sg/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Press Room</a>), who is also a good friend, to take on this task. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">As I am turning 41, toiling on this monograph is my way of celebrating for being steadfast in my love for painting, for having clinged on to my pursuit of the art-inspired life journey even through difficult times. I hope that this monograph will be a good one to share with others on my passion for painting, and to help with my further growth as a contemporary ink artist in Singapore and internationally. I will work with a distributor so that this monograph can be exposed to a greater audience. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">This monograph will feature key works of mine from the period of 2000 to 2017, including some of my works that have never been exhibited before. It is the first time such a comprehensive survey has been carried out!</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">This monograph will also be used:</p>

<h3>Impact of  the monograph </h3>
<p>I hope to reach out to art lovers, writers, curators, critics, gallerists, collectors, teachers as well as students in general. I am planning on marketing my monograph on social media platforms such as Facebook. In doing so, I not only wish to reach out to individuals living in Singapore, but also to an international audience as well. To do this, I have plans to contact international art organisations and institutes in order to market my book to a larger cultural audience. I will also be working with a PR agency for marketing support.</p>
<p>Contributing to the image of Singapore's contemporary ink art culture in the international art scene is significantly important for me. The existing contemporary ink art circle in Asia consists mainly of artists from countries such as Hong Kong, China, and Taiwan, which gives me a strong motivation to help create a name for Singapore as one of the countries with contemporary ink art. With a stronger contemporary ink art culture in existence, we would be able to foster awareness and appreciation for the beauty of ink art not only in Asia, but all around the world. </p>
<p>I believe that while press and publicity helps, the best promotion for books comes from word-of-mouth, from regular people telling other people they know about what they read... so please do spread the word!</p>
<p>I would also like to donate this book to libraries of art &amp; design schools in Singapore: </p>
<ul>
<li>Lasalle College of the Arts</li>
<li>Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) </li>
<li>National University of Singapore (NUS) </li>
<li>Nanyang Technological University, School of Art, Design &amp; Media (NTU, ADM) </li>
<li>Singapore Polytechnic </li>
<li>Ngee Ann Polytechnic</li>
<li>Temasek Polytechnic</li>
<li>Nanyang Polytechic</li>
<li>Republic Polytechnic</li>
<li>School of the Arts (SOTA) </li>
<li>Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) </li>
<li>Singapore Institute of Management (SIM University) / Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) </li>
<li><p>Singapore Institute of Technology</p></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks and Challenges </h3>
<p>I am absolutely thrilled about the release of my monograph and I hope you are, too! As with any similar project, there are many risks and challenges associated with a project of this size. </p>
<ul>
<li style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Going through 18 years of works and selecting only the best to be showcased in this monograph is really a headache! </span></li>
<li style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Asking writers/curators who have worked with me in the past to contribute essays in this monograph. The challenge is to make sure it fits the schedule of the writers/curators as everyone is very busy! </span></li>
<li style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Collaborating with Kelley on this monograph, as we need to make sure we understand each other well so as to produce a monograph that we are both proud of. </span></li>
<li style=""text-align: left;""><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Hiring the right photographer to shoot new images as needed at reasonable costs, reproducing the works in the monograph so that the colours are as close to the original as possible. This will mean press check and colours correction at the printer to make sure everything is accurate.</span></li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">Compensating the wonderful individuals who have helped me for their time and expertise.</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">At the beginning, the number of pages I wanted was about 160 pages but after the designer laid out my woks and essays, the pages doubled! This meant the printing costs will almost double too and will increase the costs of this whole project. After discussing with Kelley, she advised me to keep to 320 pages as it is important to have a comprehensive overview of my art practice rather than to remove too many works and make the book thinner and cheaper.</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">Producing the monograph is a feat but marketing it is also tricky, I have hired an old friend Florence from <a href=""http://flamecomms.com/public_relations/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Flame Communications</a> to help me with the publicity and PR of this monograph and also the book launch event. </li>
</ul>

</div></div>","My storyBook SynopsisINKPULSE charts the course of Yeo Shih Yun’s art journey from 2000 until 2017—one that chronicles from her budding years when she first fell in love with Chinese ink, to diving headfirst into Abstract Expressionism, Rothko and the other “gods” that would serve to underpin Yeo Shih Yun’s creative oeuvre and penchant for unconventional experimentations, to her eventual founding of INSTINC and collaborations with many interesting fellow artists from all parts of the globe. With an ink-based, East-meets-West aesthetic—influenced by the tutelage of eminent painter Chua Ek Kay—this monograph is a highlight on Yeo Shih Yun's pulsating pursuit for new depths and new perspectives within the realm of Abstract Expressionism,  delving into her art making process which oftentimes is akin to a spontaneous search for the poetic sentiment and dramatic unknowns. Mixing means, mediums and collaborators are important features of her painting style and creative identity as seen in her body of works. This publication is presented as a progressive catalogue of Yeo Shih Yun's art works over the years, interspersed with accounts by the people she has met along the way—gallerists, curators, friends and fellow artists alike. It is only through reading their essays does the chaos emerge into order, with the randomness of collective memories offering new angles, multi-layered dimensions and deeper connecting vibrations to Shih Yun's art.I wish to dedicate this monograph to my mum, who planted that tiny seed of art in me when I was young by bringing me to art lessons.  The BeginningAs a child growing up, my mum encouraged me to do whatever interested me. By age 5, I already knew that art would be my favourite and deeply important part of my world. In spite of my deepest desires to be immersed in creating art very early on in my life, I did not get to embark on any formal art training until in my early twenties -  compelled by the practical concerns of life and for my mum's peace of mind, I had to complete my Business degree course from NUS before I could get myself enrolled in LASALLE College of the Arts to finally pursue my true passion. At that time my decision was frowned upon and appeared to puzzle many, but I knew without a doubt that art was absolutely to be the epicentre of my core and calling for life. I could not imagine anything else.
A pivotal moment during my time at LASALLE was the UOB painting competition where I came in the top 20 for highly-commended works. Subsequently my painting, which was titled Bamboo was put on display at the UOB Plaza. Little did I know then that my painting would catch the eye of an expat couple, and it was soon sold at $1,500, a whopping sum at that time for a struggling artist. That someone would connect with my painting enough to want to have wanted to own it really sent me over the moon! I could finally catch that glimpse of hope that I could have a real shot at making art my career and possibly having the means to fund my lifelong passion if I could give it my all. 
I knew my next step was to refine my skills at the San Francisco Art Institute. However, my mother who raised me on her own, was reluctant to let me go to the far away Western hemisphere. It was after relentless persuasion, and I was elated when she finally gave me the nod. That I could get to study fine arts in the USA full-time opened my mind by a quantum leap to a whole new level of art consciousness!
Eventually, I came back to Singapore in 2002 and started off with teaching art to children while doing freelance design work. The following year, I had my first group show at the MICA building curated by Marjorie Chu of Art Forum Gallery. I will always remember and be thankful for Marjorie's critique and pointers for me in those early days as a professional artist. I felt strongly about connecting fellow artists and bridging artistic collaborations, and so in 2004 I founded INSTINC and the rest is history.
 
Timeline of my art journey 
 
                       
 
Biography of Yeo Shih Yun
Born in Singapore 1976, Shih Yun is a full-time artist and Director of INSTINC, an independent artist-run space. She received her Bachelor of Business Administration(Marketing) from National University of Singapore, Diploma in Communications Design from Lasalle College of the Arts and Post- Baccalaureate (Painting) from San Francisco Art Institute in 2002.
Yeo Shih Yun is known to reinterpret the very act of ink painting with striking results. Her experimentations of fusing the traditional form with contemporary mediums like new media or performance art has garnered much acclaim, including a commission by the Singapore Art Museum, winning the Sovereign Asian Art Prize People's Choice Award in 2012 and being awarded a Certificate of Distinction and Highly Commended Entry at the UOB Painting of the Year Competition in 2007. Her painting at the Sovereign Asian Art Prize was auctioned by Christie’s Asia in 2012. Her recent exhibition was in NUS MUSEUM titled ""Scholars and ink"".

My studio & art


 

 
Why do I want to make this monograph?
Digital files and stuff get lost all the time, and I have ever lost all my files previously when my hard disk crashed. Although we have digital clouds, ebooks and all, a physical book, just like a painting in some ways, is much more personal and ideal when it comes to documenting cherished memories and artworks. Even if all my hard disks are to crash and all my artworks are lost, this book would be a record of my artistic career from 2000 till 2017. 
I had released my first book documenting my artworks in 2006, which I self-designed to save costs. More than 10 years have passed since then, and I have come to an inflection point of my art journey to take stock and look back at a transformative chapter of my life as I reach for my next one. This time however, I feel that it is important to get the best in the field to do what they are best at, hence I am working with Kelley Cheng(The Press Room), who is also a good friend, to take on this task. 
As I am turning 41, toiling on this monograph is my way of celebrating for being steadfast in my love for painting, for having clinged on to my pursuit of the art-inspired life journey even through difficult times. I hope that this monograph will be a good one to share with others on my passion for painting, and to help with my further growth as a contemporary ink artist in Singapore and internationally. I will work with a distributor so that this monograph can be exposed to a greater audience. 
This monograph will feature key works of mine from the period of 2000 to 2017, including some of my works that have never been exhibited before. It is the first time such a comprehensive survey has been carried out!
This monograph will also be used:

As a reference book as I am invited by Singapore Teachers' Academy for the aRts (STAR) as a Artist Mentor to conduct a series of workshops over a week in NOV 2017 for a group of art teachers. 

As a resource for art/design students in Singapore who is keen to understand about Contemporary ink painting from a perspective of a local artist. (donating the monograph to various  schools with art/design/architecture  courses) 
As a great marketing tool to promote myself as a contemporaty artist.

""Shih Yun is always full of energy. I admire her commitment to her creative profession. I published my monograph 2 years ago so I understand how tough it is financially.

Where will your support go?
                             
      
* Funds exceeding the stated target will support PR of the monograph and costs of venue for book launch.
Designing the book, getting a photographer to document the works in my studio and the printing of the books all add up to quite a significant amount. Sadly, I did not get the Publishing Grant from the National Arts Council, Singapore. Therefore, this is the only platform I am using to raise funds. 
If I don't reach my goal, I will use whatever funds that I have raised here to cover: (according to priority) 

Design
Printing 
Photography 

 
 
                    
 

 

 






Impact of  the monograph 
I hope to reach out to art lovers, writers, curators, critics, gallerists, collectors, teachers as well as students in general. I am planning on marketing my monograph on social media platforms such as Facebook. In doing so, I not only wish to reach out to individuals living in Singapore, but also to an international audience as well. To do this, I have plans to contact international art organisations and institutes in order to market my book to a larger cultural audience. I will also be working with a PR agency for marketing support.
Contributing to the image of Singapore's contemporary ink art culture in the international art scene is significantly important for me. The existing contemporary ink art circle in Asia consists mainly of artists from countries such as Hong Kong, China, and Taiwan, which gives me a strong motivation to help create a name for Singapore as one of the countries with contemporary ink art. With a stronger contemporary ink art culture in existence, we would be able to foster awareness and appreciation for the beauty of ink art not only in Asia, but all around the world. 
I believe that while press and publicity helps, the best promotion for books comes from word-of-mouth, from regular people telling other people they know about what they read... so please do spread the word!
I would also like to donate this book to libraries of art & design schools in Singapore: 

Lasalle College of the Arts
Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts (NAFA) 
National University of Singapore (NUS) 
Nanyang Technological University, School of Art, Design & Media (NTU, ADM)

Risks and Challenges 
I am absolutely thrilled about the release of my monograph and I hope you are, too! As with any similar project, there are many risks and challenges associated with a project of this size. 

Going through 18 years of works and selecting only the best to be showcased in this monograph is really a headache! 
Asking writers/curators who have worked with me in the past to contribute essays in this monograph. The challenge is to make sure it fits the schedule of the writers/curators as everyone is very busy! 
Collaborating with Kelley on this monograph, as we need to make sure we understand each other well so as to produce a monograph that we are both proud of. 
Hiring the right photographer to shoot new images as needed at reasonable costs, reproducing the works in the monograph so that the colours are as close to the original as possible. This will mean press check and colours correction at the printer to make sure everything is accurate.
Compensating the wonderful individuals who have helped me for their time and expertise.
At the beginning, the number of pages I wanted was about 160 pages but after the designer laid out my woks and essays, the pages doubled! This meant the printing costs will almost double too and will increase the costs of this whole project. After discussing with Kelley, she advised me to keep to 320 pages as it is important to have a comprehensive overview of my art practice rather than to remove too many works and make the book thinner and cheaper.
Producing the monograph is a feat but marketing it is also tricky, I have hired an old friend Florence from Flame Communications to help me with the publicity and PR of this monograph and also the book launch event.

<p></p>
<p> Your support will help me cover, the costs, to frame my large paintings. If I don't reach my goal, I will use the funds, already contributed, to 
frame as many artworks, as I can afford. If I reach my goal and there are
 leftover funds, after framing costs, I will use this to buy an 
ergonomic chair with wheels and a foot stool. 
This will allow me to sit and move about the studio more comfortably 
when working.<br/></p>
<p>Costs <br/>Painting Size -  120cm x 100cm. <br/></p>
<p>Floating Frame cost - $286.00AU each. <br/></p>
<p>10 paintings - $2886.00AU <br/></p>
<p>Large Bambach chair with back $999.00AU.</p>
<p>I have almost finished the paintings and I hope to frame them in simple a
wooden, floating frame, that will cover the sides of the canvas, 
leaving a 3mm. gap between the frame and the canvas. This allows the 
artwork to float in its own space.<br/>

</div><div>
<p>This exhibition and your support will really help me expose, my new experimental artworks, to a local, regional and city audience. <br/></p>
<p>By experimenting with new materials and methods, this 
exhibition has already, challenged and pushed me, out of my comfort zone of
 just painting and has allowed me, to express my ideas more thoroughly, in my arts practice.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458036739/l5hruwqtrfkdh5mhxnju.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 217.014px;height: 288px;""/></p>
<br/><p> I have used various methods for the mixed media sculpture pieces: eco, rust  and Japanese Shibori dyeing and slow Boro stitching. To construct the  pieces, I will stitch, tear, 
burn and manipulate the material, into  sculptural objects.<br/></p>
<br/><br/><p></p>

<br/><p>I have a passion for surface quality, texture and space in my work. I  
work intuitively with paint and mixed media, to build up layers, into  
dense abstract paintings and forms. My abstract paintings are almost, finished. <br/></p>

<br/><p>They may have as many as, 5 to 50 layers. By taking away layers, 
stripping back identity, I want to get to the essence of something. This is much more

<p><b>Challenges</b><br/></p>
</div><div>
<p></p>
<p>My main challenge for this project has been finding new ways of

</div></div>","Welcome to my ""Wallmatter"" Campaign.My name is Jenny Davis. I am a visual artist who works from a studio I built from recycled materials, in the Yarra Valley,Victoria, Australia.




I have been a practicing artist for almost 25 years and work in many disciplines including : Painting,  drawing, sculpture, photography,
 collage, installation, video, new media
 and virtual  worlds. 




My artwork has been exhibited in Australia, New 
York,  Berlin, Spain, France, UK and the U.S.A. and is in numerous 
private and public  collections in Australia, UK, Europe, Canada and the
 U.S.A. I have also, won various awards and overseas arts residencies.



Artist in residency, Barcelona Spain



Installation in recessed stone wall, Barcelona Spain

About the Project
My latest project, ""Wallmatter"" will be a solo installation of new work,
at The Memo Gallery, Victoria Australia in July 2016. It will consist of large textual abstract paintings with 
three-dimensional objects using concrete, textile, rust and artist books. The work links to, the beauty of imperfections and decay, 
caused by, neglect, abandonment and the evidence of time.

What We Need & What You Get



 Your support will help me cover, the costs, to frame my large paintings. If I don't reach my goal, I will use the funds, already contributed, to 
frame as many artworks, as I can afford. If I reach my goal and there are
 leftover funds, after framing costs, I will use this to buy an 
ergonomic chair with wheels and a foot stool. 
This will allow me to sit and move about the studio more comfortably 
when working.
Costs Painting Size -  120cm x 100cm. 
Floating Frame cost - $286.00AU each. 
10 paintings - $2886.00AU 
Large Bambach chair with back $999.00AU.
I have almost finished the paintings and I hope to frame them in simple a
wooden, floating frame, that will cover the sides of the canvas, 
leaving a 3mm. gap between the frame and the canvas. This allows the 
artwork to float in its own space.

I have some awesome perks on offer for my supporters!$20   Set of 5 Artist Postcards - 25 Available

$40      Original Collage 14x10cm - 16 Available


$60       Original Collage 19x14cm - 21 Available

Please choose your rewards in the right hand colum near the top of this page!   The Impact

This exhibition and your support will really help me expose, my new experimental artworks, to a local, regional and city audience. 
By experimenting with new materials and methods, this 
exhibition has already, challenged and pushed me, out of my comfort zone of
 just painting and has allowed me, to express my ideas more thoroughly, in my arts practice.


 I have used various methods for the mixed media sculpture pieces: eco, rust  and Japanese Shibori dyeing and slow Boro stitching. To construct the  pieces, I will stitch, tear, 
burn and manipulate the material, into  sculptural objects.


I have a passion for surface quality, texture and space in my work. I  
work intuitively with paint and mixed media, to build up layers, into  
dense abstract paintings and forms. My abstract paintings are almost, finished. 





They may have as many as, 5 to 50 layers. By taking away layers, 
stripping back identity, I want to get to the essence of something. This is much more 
interesting to me than, creating something recognizable.


Challenges


My main challenge for this project has been finding new ways of 
working 
on such a large body of work, after receiving injuries to my neck and 
spine in a car accident, years ago. As a result, as time has gone on,
 I have lymphedema (swelling) in both legs, which means I can only 
work in short bursts.  Whereas, years ago I was able to paint 8-12 hours
 straight.
So far I have created, 8 large 
paintings and 10 small paintings. My proposal for the gallery space requires me to have 20 paintings altogether with 
several, mixed media sculptures, using concrete, rust and cloth. I am well on my way,
I am now experimenting with concrete, textiles and rust creating my 3d objects by adding texture and form, to cloth fragments  and found 
objects.
I hope this exhibition will offer my audience a new way of seeing!

The message to space portal allows you to pick a date and time that is suitable for you and is suitable for all ages.        </p><p> </p><h3><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></h3><p>As well as contributing (if you can) please take the time to share this campaign with friends, family and on your social media networks.

Our team is personally covering all its own expenses.  All the money raised will go toward the project.  If the full amount is not funded we will have to cut back on some aspects of the lighting and laser systems.  This project deserves to be shown on the Playa in its full glory and we hope you will contribute and become a part of the Probability Probes history. In return for helping us fund the remainder of the project, we offer you a chance to experience the Probability Probe at three stories high, it is one of the largest, most elaborate recycled steel sculptures to have even been constructed.  To make it a little more interesting and interactive our team have added the ability to send Burner Cosmic Messages i.e. targeted messages into outer space and what better place to do this than on the Playa at this year’s Burn.  For those of you who are unable to attend Burningman this year, we have designed and completed a web portal that can be accessed from anywhere in the world and will enable you to still experience the excitement of sending your message into space and having your voice heard throughout the universe. The message to space portal allows you to pick a date and time that is suitable for you and is suitable for all ages.         Other Ways You Can HelpAs well as contributing (if you can) please take the time to share this campaign with friends, family and on your social media networks.

Cork, IrelandMessage to Space PortalThe Probability Probe message to space portal provides users with the ability to directly target an exoplanet from a database of over 3,000 that have been discovered and have the conditions necessary to support life and send a personalized message directly to this planet. This web-based portal can be accessed from anywhere in the world including Black Rock City at Burningman.  In effect, we are linking Black Rock City with Black Rock Castle Observatory in Co. Cork Ireland in real time.Simply scroll down to the Scheduler and pick a date and time which is good for you. Click on Confirm to add it to your schedule. You can also delete any previously reserved slots so you can free up space for others.Once you have a slot reserved, a counter will show you how much time you have to wait for your experience.To send a message to space, you must first pick a star.Before you make your choice it’s a good idea to take a couple of factors into consideration including its distance from the Earth and its angle above the horizon.  First, consider its distance: a message becomes weaker the further it must travel. The closer the star is, the better the message has of arriving in one piece. Second, consider its angle above the earth Our atmosphere has a big effect on how weak or how strong the signal will be.If we send to a star close to our zenith (straight up), it passes through much less of the atmosphere than if we send our message to a star closer to the horizon.  The Stars altitude depends on the time of day and year.  Some stars can only be seen for a short space of time and others are only visible from the Southern Hemisphere.Now it’s time to choose your target star.  Use what you have learned to pick the best target.Once you have chosen your target star it’s time to think about what you will say in your message. Here are some previous famous messages that have been sent.This message was sent in 2003 from the Evpatoria telescope in the Ukraine.Like the Arecibo message, the message was based on symbols. It was designed to be strong for space communication. It contained similar information to the Arecibo message. However, it introduced new concepts such as
mathematics
chemical elements
units of measurement
the Earth
and cosmology
The last section asks whoever has got the message to respond with similar information.The most recent message as actually computer programs.Ok along with your personal message we will attach one of these previous famous messages to your interstellar communication. Please choose one.Now it’s time to type your personal message, take your time and when you are ready to send hit send the message!Congratulations you have now completed your mission to send a personalized message into space all you have to do now is wait for a response!",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Hand Washing Project</h3>
<p>This <strong>socially engaged</strong> project is a combination of <strong>participatory art and paintings</strong> meant to break down barriers between individuals. By enlisting people to wash each others hands I'm trying to critique our contrived systems of injustice, prejudice, and notions of difference. The water, pigments, lye, and salts used in these hand-washing interactions are then used to create unique works of art. The paintings which result are formed through the evaporation of the water and what remains is the residue of salt crystals, oils, and pigments. <strong>These paintings become the shared marks of the participants</strong>, highlighting the individuals' dependence to the other and vice versa.  </p>
<div>
<p>As much as we need to accept difference it is more important to connect with others who are different from ourselves and find the humanity in one another. Our humanity is universal and I believe physical touch can teach us that. Scientific research shows that increased physical touch decreases violence and creates greater trust between individuals. Touch can release oxytocin, the ""love hormone,"" and stimulates feelings of compassion and trust between individuals. The Washing Hands Project cleanses and unites people and does so in a tangible, physical, and intimate way.</p>
<p>In a Utopian world we would all get along, there would be no war, and there would be no injustice. Everyone would be taken care of and no one would go without. To strive for this Utopia we have to connect with people we normally would not connect with. This has to start by each of us realizing we are the same as our neighbors. We are more similar than different. We are all just people.  What I’m doing is using the power of touch to help people be more understanding of one another. </p>
<p>In light of the last few months and all the division in our country I’ve been thinking a lot about what causes someone to be ""different"" from ourselves? How do we feel connected to others? Why is physical touch so important in relationships? The <i>WHP </i>is a socially engaged work exploring these questions. I believe in the axiom that we are connected to one another and that we are all equal. In this project <strong>I’m working with people of all colors, races, genders, sexualities,classes and ideologies and trying to bring people together who otherwise would not mix.</strong> I’ve already started working with a few people and you can check out one of the videos here</p>

<p> </p>
<p>This video is of a woman, Andi who works with the homeless and a homeless man named Larry. Larry was touched by the power of the interaction he had with Andi and it revitalizes my belief in how important this project really is. The participants in these hand washing pieces represent the full spectrum of humanity. I’m facilitating these performances and then capturing the water used in the washed hands. During these hand washing interactions water is combined with pigments, lye, charcoal, and salts to create “paintings” which symbolize the “fingerprints” of the participants involved. These paintings live on as the mixture of two people who connected with one another. Some of these paintings will be sold (hopefully to you), others given to participants, and some to be exhibited along with videos of the various hand washing performances. Check out the gallery to see some examples of these paintings. I truly hope you will support this meaningful work.</p>

<h3>Why should you contribute?</h3>
<p>- Contributing helps broaden the audience of this meaningful work which means to bring people of all different races, religions, genders, ideologies, and economic backgrounds together. Your contributions will help with my material costs, some travel costs, compensation to others, and help me earn a living wage as an artist. </p>
<p>- Contributing can also be an opportunity to purchase a unique work of art. These pieces are beautiful and over the last few months I have been developing and perfecting the technique to create these pieces.</p>
<p>- You could also support this project by purchasing <i>The Washing Hands Experience</i> and I will bring this project into your workplace, or with a group, or with another individual. I am offering supporters the chance to purchase their own hand washing experiences which will include the artwork created, a presentation on the power of touch, and a workshop. This project is meaningful to everyone who participates and I would love to share the experience personally with you. </p>

Lacuna Gallery will support the practices of installation, sculptural ceramics, abstraction and other conceptual artistic media which we believe are currently underrepresented in Minneapolis.</p><p>Over the last several years, we have encountered many artists that are dedicated to their practice but need a flexible, professional space to install and exhibit the work they are making in their studios. As working artists ourselves, we understand the enormous impact that having a space to execute ambitious projects can have on the creative growth of an artist and the outcomes of their work.</p><p>We aim to give working artists professional support by providing studio space, project space and exhibition space.  Each of these spaces will be used to foster an ongoing dialogue between the artists practicing in the space, exhibiting artists, community supporters, collectors, ourselves and the general public.  Artists will have opportunities to share the work with the community, make professional connections and participate in a sales outlet.  In addition to hosting regular shows  in the exhibition space, Lacuna Gallery will organize other supporting events throughout the year to help build stronger connections between art and community, including but not limited to studio dinners, artists markets and public discussions.</p><p><strong>The Space</strong></p><p>We have secured a beautiful, 2000 sq. foot space located in South Minneapolis at the intersection of <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lacuna+Gallery/@44.9342814,-93.2613152,14.88z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xe299521b29bde386!8m2!3d44.934807!4d-93.262772"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Chicago Avenue and 38th street</a>, at the cross section of four main South Minneapolis neighborhoods.

It will house a 700 sq ft exhibition space and a 250 sq. foot 'Project Space'. Lacuna is thrilled to host the ‘Project Space’ which will be a resource available to Lacuna studio artists as well as community artists for brief periods of time. This versatile mini-gallery will allow artists to install and professionally document their work, as well as provide an opportunity to gain conceptual growth through conversation and contemplation about works that are in-process.  </p><p>In addition to exhibition and project space, in the white-washed, well lit basement are four semi-private studio spaces available for rent to professional working artists including space for electric kilns, shared workspace and storage.</p><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p>As you can see, Lacuna Gallery has big plans. Your contributions will enable us to make Lacuna Gallery’s first year a success. As owners, Brittany and Erin both have capital contributions in place for some startup and first year operations costs, but we are looking to raise an additional $15,000 to help us with rent for one year, programing costs and renovations. Even though the building we are activating is in great shape, the space needs electrical for kilns, track lighting, materials for installation and deinstallation of artwork, construction of a floating wall for the project space and renovation to the basement space to make it a safe, functional workspace for artists to use.  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1512018408/vfrjkfujuxdodxqf7co6.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>We hope you see our passion and commitment to making Lacuna become a reality.  Your contribution will allow us to focus on Lacuna Gallery programming, management and relationships during the first year so we can build a strong community space you can enjoy for years to come.</p><p><strong>Perks</strong></p><p>To show our enormous appreciation for your contribution to this campaign, we have put together a great line up of perks that include handmade ceramic objects by yours truly, Lacuna Gallery swag, and curated gallery experiences for you to share and enjoy.  Please don't hesitate to contact us via email at <a href=""mailto:hello@lacunagallery.com?subject=Indiegogo%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">hello@lacunagallery.com</a> if you have any questions about making a contributions or getting a perk!</p><p> </p><p><strong>Risks</strong></p><p>We realize that this is a big venture and there are many risks associated with starting an art gallery from scratch. The first year is going to be a bit of a learning curve with us stepping out of our roles as professional artists and into the roles of business owners, curators, managers, art dealers, landlords and accountants. Yet, we’ve prepared for these roles and have a business plan that includes three years of operations and a diversified business model with costs being covered by varied income sources throughout the year. This allows us to focus on supporting and exhibiting truly exciting artwork, not just art that sells. We are aware of our challenges and we know Lacuna Gallery is worth the incredible reward of establishing and running this unique art space in South Minneapolis!  </p><p><strong>Thanks!</strong></p><p>Lacuna Gallery has been all talk and planning for nearly three years! We are extremely energized and excited about this venture but now is the time to get it off the ground!  With your help, Lacuna’s creative space will bring more attention to underrepresented artists from around the country and become a unique staple in the Minneapolis gallery scene.  If you aren't able to donate at this time, you can help us out by sharing this campaign with your friends and family via email and social media.

Lacuna Gallery will support the practices of installation, sculptural ceramics, abstraction and other conceptual artistic media which we believe are currently underrepresented in Minneapolis.Over the last several years, we have encountered many artists that are dedicated to their practice but need a flexible, professional space to install and exhibit the work they are making in their studios. As working artists ourselves, we understand the enormous impact that having a space to execute ambitious projects can have on the creative growth of an artist and the outcomes of their work.We aim to give working artists professional support by providing studio space, project space and exhibition space.  Each of these spaces will be used to foster an ongoing dialogue between the artists practicing in the space, exhibiting artists, community supporters, collectors, ourselves and the general public.  Artists will have opportunities to share the work with the community, make professional connections and participate in a sales outlet.  In addition to hosting regular shows  in the exhibition space, Lacuna Gallery will organize other supporting events throughout the year to help build stronger connections between art and community, including but not limited to studio dinners, artists markets and public discussions.The SpaceWe have secured a beautiful, 2000 sq. foot space located in South Minneapolis at the intersection of Chicago Avenue and 38th street, at the cross section of four main South Minneapolis neighborhoods. Tucked in the neighborhood with us is the Chicago Avenue Fire Arts Center, 3rd Place Gallery, Covet Consign, Frank Modern, Blackeye Coffee and City Food Studio to name a few.Upstairs, the shotgun space with original wood floors is naturally lit by a large storefront and transom windows. It will house a 700 sq ft exhibition space and a 250 sq. foot 'Project Space'. Lacuna is thrilled to host the ‘Project Space’ which will be a resource available to Lacuna studio artists as well as community artists for brief periods of time. This versatile mini-gallery will allow artists to install and professionally document their work, as well as provide an opportunity to gain conceptual growth through conversation and contemplation about works that are in-process.  In addition to exhibition and project space, in the white-washed, well lit basement are four semi-private studio spaces available for rent to professional working artists including space for electric kilns, shared workspace and storage.The ImpactAs you can see, Lacuna Gallery has big plans. Your contributions will enable us to make Lacuna Gallery’s first year a success. As owners, Brittany and Erin both have capital contributions in place for some startup and first year operations costs, but we are looking to raise an additional $15,000 to help us with rent for one year, programing costs and renovations. Even though the building we are activating is in great shape, the space needs electrical for kilns, track lighting, materials for installation and deinstallation of artwork, construction of a floating wall for the project space and renovation to the basement space to make it a safe, functional workspace for artists to use.  We hope you see our passion and commitment to making Lacuna become a reality.  Your contribution will allow us to focus on Lacuna Gallery programming, management and relationships during the first year so we can build a strong community space you can enjoy for years to come.PerksTo show our enormous appreciation for your contribution to this campaign, we have put together a great line up of perks that include handmade ceramic objects by yours truly, Lacuna Gallery swag, and curated gallery experiences for you to share and enjoy.  Please don't hesitate to contact us via email at hello@lacunagallery.com if you have any questions about making a contributions or getting a perk! RisksWe realize that this is a big venture and there are many risks associated with starting an art gallery from scratch. The first year is going to be a bit of a learning curve with us stepping out of our roles as professional artists and into the roles of business owners, curators, managers, art dealers, landlords and accountants. Yet, we’ve prepared for these roles and have a business plan that includes three years of operations and a diversified business model with costs being covered by varied income sources throughout the year. This allows us to focus on supporting and exhibiting truly exciting artwork, not just art that sells. We are aware of our challenges and we know Lacuna Gallery is worth the incredible reward of establishing and running this unique art space in South Minneapolis!  Thanks!Lacuna Gallery has been all talk and planning for nearly three years! We are extremely energized and excited about this venture but now is the time to get it off the ground!  With your help, Lacuna’s creative space will bring more attention to underrepresented artists from around the country and become a unique staple in the Minneapolis gallery scene.  If you aren't able to donate at this time, you can help us out by sharing this campaign with your friends and family via email and social media. This endeavor would not be possible without you and we are so grateful to you for any help you can give!    MoreStay up to date with us by following this campaign:IndiegogoFacebook (@lacunagallerympls)Instagram (@lacunagallery).Want to get in touch with us right now?

Black communities have been among the hardest hit by austerity and the arts are consistently undermined by cuts. We want to run an exhibition in January 2016 supporting artists of African heritage, bringing them together and celebrating their work.






About us Theoo is a growing Community Interest Company based in the UK. Involvement in grassroots art projects like ours is proved to boost self confidence and community cohesion. We galvanise the skills and potential of upcoming and established artists alike to make change happen in the community. 
Our current project is the African Collective Placement. The theme is The Sub-Saharan Main Course (SSMC). In this project, art from artists from Black and African heritage is exhibited in various social spaces and public areas to invite much needed conversation on Sub-Saharan Africa. An exhibition will follow directly on from this, bringing the art together in one place as a celebration of the talent that lies in the under-represented parts of our society. We also actively encourage female artists to participate.
We had already had interest from emerging and established artists from around the UK, the US and Nigeria all eager to see Black African artists flourish! 
To make this happen successfully, we have a target of £1500 and a belief in our exceptional artists.
   The funding targets

Advertising- to reach out to under-represented artists who need exposure via various media and to attract endorsements from known artists and organisations to help the project grow.

Securing a venue- one that is accessible to non-traditional audiences but also reflects the high quality and innovative work our artists produce.

Transport- We want to subsidise the cost to the artists of transporting their work from their many locations, so that financial difficulty is not a barrier to participation.


Catering- the exhibition will be non-conventional and approachable for people who don't traditionally visit events of this sort. To do this, we want the exhibition to be seen as a social event where individuals of all backgrounds can comfortably learn, discuss and share ideas.

Merchandising We want to transfer our current merchandising production arrangements to a Nigerian company thus supporting these indigenous entrepreneurs. We need a deposit to secure this sustainably.
   The Impact Your donation can help our artists rise. The bigger and more successful this exhibition is, the more exposure and inarguable recognition our artists will receive. They will be exhibited with known artists and have the opportunity to network and build their own profiles with support from us and the wider artistic community. In turn, their respective communities will benefit and see investment in these talents to be worthwhile. 
In the long term, we will be able to show budding artists there is a wealth of support available to get behind them and see to it to they are represented in what can be an otherwise daunting circle. 


Future implications
This project will generate future funding for future projects through 
- ticket and merchandise sales
- sponsorship gained from attendees to the exhibition
- auction of artwork after the exhibition (majority proceeds for artists directly)
Donors are offered exhibition tickets and the chance to meet our artists personally.

</b><p>Rosa (Exploding): Armando, for god’s sake! I don’t love you. You are... you’re just a simple bricklayer; you are no one, nothing. (Bitter) Yes, I’m a whore but at least I’m something; A grown up woman, and you want me to tell you why I’m here? After all these years maybe now is the right time so you can just walk down the hallway and never come back, I’m tired of your stories, I’m tired of your analysis; I’m tired of your romanticized ways. (Visceral) Life is cruel, damned, life is sex and shit and food and sex and blood and curses and feelings. Life is... life is a night at home with the family watching abuelo dance tango with my aunts while they sing and talk about better times. Life is... life will never be here. This country has no space for me and yet I insist on being here. (Pause) I have a mother that needs me. (Pause) (Starting to cry, trying hard not to look weak) she’s dying Armando, lung cancer... the only thing I can do to pay her treatment lies between my legs. My body for hers. My soul for hers. Do you still think I’m going to marry a shitty gringo? I hate them all.  The way they smell and their fake smiles, their greed, the little grace they have to dance and don’t even make me talk about sex, they are not even worth a blowjob. You are not different Manny. I don’t belong in this city. (She goes for a drink) I can’t lie. I can’t behave according to the code and I’m declared a brute for that. Well, you found it, an animal, a boor. My soul stinks and my pussy hurts and bleeds and I don’t have to discuss this with you. Leave now. </p>
<br/>
</div><div>
<p><b>Armando's Monologue:</b></p>
<p>Armando: Sometimes I think everything came from an unexpected collision, a thing that made everything a singularity, a coincidence, a divine punishment for all the evil we haven’t committed yet, like when my mother said she didn’t deserve the misery life gave her Miss. (Pause)</p>
<p>When I think about my family the only thing I see is birds, isn’t that weird? I see birds trying to fly, birds trapped in cages made of hand-crafted, delicate iron. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We humans are very peculiar beings; we dedicate our lives to knowledge, to a quest for some logical explanation. (Pause) What if we discover that living is just another stage (Pause) We would probably destroy ourselves. (Pause) We’d be nothing more than animals. (Pause) But wouldn’t that be good? What I’m trying to say is, humans everywhere are trying to survive; can you “try” to survive? You survive or you don’t, where’s the midpoint? And wouldn’t it be easier to survive if we started to recognize that we are all equal and equal to nature? Time could be so much less severe. (Raising in passion) People would stop wasting </p>
<p>their time searching for ideals, they’d live, they wouldn’t worry, they’d laugh and cry and believe. No more White or black or Latino or European, we’d become a specie, the same as rats or lions. (Pause) (Discovering something) Surely we’d be less efficient. Humans are nothing; our weapons are something, our buildings are... our creations are... but us? We don’t even survive a cold. We’re vulnerable. No animal in the world fears us, they fear our creations. We are insufficient; we need to shield ourselves with clothes and weapons to survive. Am I talking nonsense Miss? (Bitter and Torn) It’s just... What is the United States? A country? What’s a country? A group of people? We all are people... What is the United States then? A selected group of people? Perhaps there are selected groups of Lions... grouping is a need I guess. (Pause) That girl... she radiated the purity, the nobility of a wild free animal. I...

We are raising money to make it happen on a contemporary space. The idea is to create an experimental immersion process for the audience to come join the puzzle of this character's life, the money will be used for renting a space, paying the actors and creating publicity. Rosa's Monologue:

Cristina: Alright, enjoy the bench. I’m going that way. 


Pause.


He looks at her.


Cristina: Thank you. Oh. look. it stop snowing.


Manny: Have a good day miss.


Cristina: Hope to see you around someday.


Manny: Same.


Cristina looks at him, smiles, leaves humming the tango.


Manny sighs, he is focused on writing. 


A little girl enters and looks at him. Manny doesn’t see it, he is writing.


Little girl: Mister.


Manny looks up. He is trembling, he starts to cry.


Manny: You.


Little Girl: She wants you to know she remembers you. 


Manny: This…


Little Girl: Mister. She remembers you, don’t cry please. She says she is better now and you don’t have to worry anymore mister. She also says she loves the way you write and she forgives you for everything. Mister, she says you have to work for what you believe is right and you also have to stand tall. Mister, she says she is sorry she never learned English and you were disappointed of her. She also says she did the best she could until her last day. Mister, one last thing, she says she forgives you for calling the cops, she says she forgives you for leaving her behind and never, ever, ever call her or visit her. Mister. She says she has always love you.


Manny: I know what this is.


Little Girl: Bye mister.


The little girl leaves.












Manny: My mother sold herself to give me a better life,  she was a prostitute, an immigrant prostitute,  she had lung cancer from smoking and she worked every fucked up day of her life for me. I know what this is. I’m a fucked up bastard. I never value her words, or her smile, or her sorrow. I didn’t… I DIDN’T WANT TO REMEMBER. I’m lost in this city, lost, with her, with her memory.  I didn’t want to accept it. I left her dying. I’m a selfish bastard. selfish. bastard. I want to stop writing DO YOU HEAR ME GOD? I don’t want to remember. I don’t want to see it. They came through the door, they, she, deported. I stood. I wanted to. Be. A. Playwright. Change. The. World. After. Nine. Eleventh. I. Didn’t. Want. To. Remember.  I miss her. Mommy, I miss you. I’m your little baby boy, where are you? Mama. I’m lost, lost in this shitty city in this shitty country. I’m lost in New york. I dont want to write anymore.


He screams. 


Manny:  I don’t want to write anymore. I don’t… want… to… write… any… more.

<p>The Moreno Valley Arts Council has served the communities of Moreno Valley in northern New Mexico for 35 years.  We provide workshops, education, exhibits, shows, competitions, concerts and performances. We have always hopped from place to place because we had no venue of our own. </p>
<p>I am Katherine, the Executive Director. I have worked with and for the Board for 15 years.  The dedicated people who started and sustained this organization gave us the footing and programming which allows us to grow.  It's simple. To continue to grow the arts in our communities, we need a home of our own.  There are several available spaces right now, that could serve our primary needs.  How big we go depends on how much we ultimately raise. We need space for workshops, performances, for rehearsals, for fine art exhibits, and art events, A place for the communities we serve to enjoy the arts. Even for simple meeting space we scramble month to month. </p>
<p>We  know that $20,000 won't buy a facility.  Or $40,000 with the match. So why is that what we're asking for?  First, we believe it is achievable.  More importantly, with those funds we can leverage more funds with opportunities which require a match.  We can double or even triple the amount we can raise in this short term.  If we raise more than $20,000, it gets even easier.  Indiegogo keeps our account open to grow. There is an opportunity for a facility which would be a good fit for all but full performances.  With $100,000 we could buy it outright, do some updates/repairs, and still have funds for about a year of utilities and insurance.  We have a business plan and opportunity for grants. </p>
<p>We are also working closely with the Artist Guild of Northern New Mexico. This group of all local artists organizes displays and shows and manages an ongoing show at our local visitors center.  Their 30 members are also our members and will be an integral part of our future home.  We are committed to Northern New Mexican artists and will strive to continually lift the stature of the arts in our communities.  We can see Poetry Readings, Literary soliloquies and similar events for the benefit of enriching the lives of our residents and visitors, which is integral to our mission.  </p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>Above I explained more about what we need.  In short, we are aiming right now for $20,000 which is a starting place from which to grow the funding we'll need to make the art center a reality. It is what we need for initial negotiations with building owners to demonstrate we are serious about this. We plan to pass this center on to the future generations to continue the arts foundation built before us.  Further, as I explained above, we intend to leverage these funds with other funding opportunities that require a match.  Our ultimate goal is to acquire a space for cash with no obligatory Real Estate Contracts.  We have some great benefits for supporters donated by members and by ourselves.  No matter what you donate, you can choose to receive the ""perk"" or not, and, you can choose to be identified or not.  <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>Long term, we see having our own space as a sustainable commitment to bringing the Arts to our communities.  We believe the long term impact of an Arts Activities Center is integral to the growth and sustainability of the communities we serve.  A number of young families are moving in....providing access to the Arts via workshops, performances, concerts and even access to dance is essential to the development of young people and to the enrichment of the adults.  Having a space that everyone knows is ""where the Arts are"" is part of the strategy of building Arts Based Rural Economic Development.  Garnering support from outside agencies and foundations is also increased when there is a specific facility that everyone can find where they can take workshops, see performances and experience the arts.<br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>There are challenges such as the fact that we are located in a small, rural and remote community. We operate a lot of programs/events on a shoestring, as it were.  We have to reach out to reach the funding goals we have and this is just the beginning.  If we reach our goal here, we can leverage those funds with other agencies, foundations and other funding opportunities to help us get enough funding to achieve this goal.  If we don't reach our goal, we won't stop. And this is important....if we don't meet our goal, we still get what has been donated, and pay indiegogo a fee (9%) But if we DO hit our goal (or more) that fee drops to 4%!  That format is why we chose indiegogo.  Any funding we achieve here will to a special restricted account for a facility. It will not be used for operations..we have other funding streams for that, which can not be used for capital acquisition. There is really little risk...we are committed to having a home.  It is simply a matter of how fast we get there.  All of the perks promised will be delivered, No matter what.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>We know that not everyone who supports what we do can contribute.  You can still help.  Spread the news.  There are share tools right here on this site.  Share, share share!  And thank you, thank you, thank you.<br/>

This group of all local artists organizes displays and shows and manages an ongoing show at our local visitors center.  Their 30 members are also our members and will be an integral part of our future home.  We are committed to Northern New Mexican artists and will strive to continually lift the stature of the arts in our communities.  We can see Poetry Readings, Literary soliloquies and similar events for the benefit of enriching the lives of our residents and visitors, which is integral to our mission.  
   What We Need & What You GetAbove I explained more about what we need.  In short, we are aiming right now for $20,000 which is a starting place from which to grow the funding we'll need to make the art center a reality. It is what we need for initial negotiations with building owners to demonstrate we are serious about this. We plan to pass this center on to the future generations to continue the arts foundation built before us.  Further, as I explained above, we intend to leverage these funds with other funding opportunities that require a match.  Our ultimate goal is to acquire a space for cash with no obligatory Real Estate Contracts.  We have some great benefits for supporters donated by members and by ourselves.  No matter what you donate, you can choose to receive the ""perk"" or not, and, you can choose to be identified or not.  
  The ImpactLong term, we see having our own space as a sustainable commitment to bringing the Arts to our communities.  We believe the long term impact of an Arts Activities Center is integral to the growth and sustainability of the communities we serve.  A number of young families are moving in....providing access to the Arts via workshops, performances, concerts and even access to dance is essential to the development of young people and to the enrichment of the adults.  Having a space that everyone knows is ""where the Arts are"" is part of the strategy of building Arts Based Rural Economic Development.  Garnering support from outside agencies and foundations is also increased when there is a specific facility that everyone can find where they can take workshops, see performances and experience the arts.
  Risks & ChallengesThere are challenges such as the fact that we are located in a small, rural and remote community. We operate a lot of programs/events on a shoestring, as it were.  We have to reach out to reach the funding goals we have and this is just the beginning.  If we reach our goal here, we can leverage those funds with other agencies, foundations and other funding opportunities to help us get enough funding to achieve this goal.  If we don't reach our goal, we won't stop. And this is important....if we don't meet our goal, we still get what has been donated, and pay indiegogo a fee (9%) But if we DO hit our goal (or more) that fee drops to 4%!  That format is why we chose indiegogo.  Any funding we achieve here will to a special restricted account for a facility. It will not be used for operations..we have other funding streams for that, which can not be used for capital acquisition. There is really little risk...we are committed to having a home.  It is simply a matter of how fast we get there.  All of the perks promised will be delivered, No matter what.
  Other Ways You Can HelpWe know that not everyone who supports what we do can contribute.  You can still help.  Spread the news.  There are share tools right here on this site.  Share, share share!  And thank you, thank you, thank you.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>You can help produce and archive this historic and monumental collaboration of art and music, </p>
<p>During his highly public struggle with the city of Philadelphia to save his iconic studio from seizure under Eminient Domain, artist James E. Dupree developed over 400 pieces of artwork. Now, these pieces are brought together in the exhibition <i>Stolen Dreams in the Promise Zone </i>at Stockton University Art Garage in Atlantic City<i>. </i>Renown composer, bassist and producer Jamaaladeen Tacuma provides a powerful musical rendition of the installation titled <i>The Black Picasso &amp; Goliath– Breaking it All the Way Down</i>. Each of The Black Picasso &amp; Goliath's three movements reach deep into the total experience of Dupree's battle, resulting in a composition that conveys turmoil, passion and the triumphant result.  </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Tacuma's composition will be performed live on Friday August 28 from 6PM-8PM, is  free and to the public. Your contribution will help make this event happen and produce its documentation.  </span><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">How Your Contribution is Used</span></p>
</div><div> <p>
</p>
<p>100% Your donation to this project supports this historic,
groundbreaking arts event in two ways:</p>
<p><b>1. Making the Event Happen: </b></p>
<p>Your donation will go directly to paying musicians and
renting sound equipment to perform Tacuma's <i>The Black Picasso &amp; Goliath</i> which is free to attend for all. This three movement piece puts sound to the visual installation <i>Stolen
Dreams in the Promise Zone</i>, chronicling Dupree's seven year struggle to save
his studio and museum from the hands of Eminent Domain laws in Philadelphia. </p>
<p><b>2. Preserving This Piece of History</b></p>
<p>This once in a lifetime event can never be attended twice,
but it can be preserved in history in the form of a video and audio recording.  Your contribution
will help in rental and studio costs to digitally archive Tacuma's composition both in the form of an audio recording, and a DVD of the live performance at Stockton University Art Garage, which you can receive as a perk of your donation! </p>

<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">James E. Dupree</span></h3>
<h3><span style=""font-size: 16px; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 26px;"">James E. Dupree is an accomplished artist, educator, and business owner.  Raised in between Philly and Pittsburgh, Dupree lived as a child just a few blocks from his Haverford Ave. studio.  Among the first black graduates of the University of Pennsylvania MFA program, and a recent recipient of the UPenn Black Alumni Society's Living Legend Award, he is in many ways an example of the success of Philadelphia’s art institutions in addressing the city’s underprivileged communities. He attended free classes at Fleisher Art Memorial as a child, he later received a full scholarship at Columbus College of Art and Design, and went on to prominence via graduate school at Pennsylvania Academy of the Arts and the University of Pennsylvania.</span></h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<p>Dupree’s works are in the permanent collections of several museums, including the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the African American Museum in Philadelphia, and the Schomberg Museum in Copenhagen, as well as in private collections of the Dave Matthews Band and Patti LaBelle. He has been artist-in-residence at numerous cultural institutions including the National Museum of Wales and the Studio Museum of Harlem, and his sets for a Mummers Fancy Brigade club, the Shooting Stars, won them first place two years in a row and him the nickname of ""King James"". <br/><br/>As an educator, he and his wife spent seven years running  and teaching at the Community Voyage School for runaway children at 35th and Lancaster Ave., and Mr. Dupree also taught at the Prints in Progress after-school program at 3500 Lancaster in the CEC building.  Dupree taught in higher education for many years at the University of the Arts and PAFA.  Currently, in addition to the private instruction offered at Dupree Studios, you can take free figure painting classes with Dupree at Fleisher Art Memorial.</p>
<p>Mr. Dupree has used his success as an artist to reinvest in the Philadelphia communities of his roots. There are many well-known examples of that investment, but one example that stands out is his studio in the Mantua neighborhood. His success is a product of the best Philadelphia art institutions, and he is an exemplary model of a Philadelphian investing back in his community. Part of his long term goals, his dream, has been to leave Dupree Studios as a pillar in the Mantua community.</p>

</div></div>","Project Summary
You can help produce and archive this historic and monumental collaboration of art and music, 
During his highly public struggle with the city of Philadelphia to save his iconic studio from seizure under Eminient Domain, artist James E. Dupree developed over 400 pieces of artwork. Now, these pieces are brought together in the exhibition Stolen Dreams in the Promise Zone at Stockton University Art Garage in Atlantic City. Renown composer, bassist and producer Jamaaladeen Tacuma provides a powerful musical rendition of the installation titled The Black Picasso & Goliath– Breaking it All the Way Down. Each of The Black Picasso & Goliath's three movements reach deep into the total experience of Dupree's battle, resulting in a composition that conveys turmoil, passion and the triumphant result.  
Tacuma's composition will be performed live on Friday August 28 from 6PM-8PM, is  free and to the public. Your contribution will help make this event happen and produce its documentation.  

How Your Contribution is Used
 

100% Your donation to this project supports this historic,
groundbreaking arts event in two ways:
1. Making the Event Happen: 
Your donation will go directly to paying musicians and
renting sound equipment to perform Tacuma's The Black Picasso & Goliath which is free to attend for all. This three movement piece puts sound to the visual installation Stolen
Dreams in the Promise Zone, chronicling Dupree's seven year struggle to save
his studio and museum from the hands of Eminent Domain laws in Philadelphia. 
2. Preserving This Piece of History
This once in a lifetime event can never be attended twice,
but it can be preserved in history in the form of a video and audio recording.  Your contribution
will help in rental and studio costs to digitally archive Tacuma's composition both in the form of an audio recording, and a DVD of the live performance at Stockton University Art Garage, which you can receive as a perk of your donation! 


    About the Artists:

James E. Dupree
James E. Dupree is an accomplished artist, educator, and business owner.  Raised in between Philly and Pittsburgh, Dupree lived as a child just a few blocks from his Haverford Ave. studio.  Among the first black graduates of the University of Pennsylvania MFA program, and a recent recipient of the UPenn Black Alumni Society's Living Legend Award, he is in many ways an example of the success of Philadelphia’s art institutions in addressing the city’s underprivileged communities. He attended free classes at Fleisher Art Memorial as a child, he later received a full scholarship at Columbus College of Art and Design, and went on to prominence via graduate school at Pennsylvania Academy of the Arts and the University of Pennsylvania.

Dupree’s works are in the permanent collections of several museums, including the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the African American Museum in Philadelphia, and the Schomberg Museum in Copenhagen, as well as in private collections of the Dave Matthews Band and Patti LaBelle. He has been artist-in-residence at numerous cultural institutions including the National Museum of Wales and the Studio Museum of Harlem, and his sets for a Mummers Fancy Brigade club, the Shooting Stars, won them first place two years in a row and him the nickname of ""King James"". As an educator, he and his wife spent seven years running  and teaching at the Community Voyage School for runaway children at 35th and Lancaster Ave., and Mr. Dupree also taught at the Prints in Progress after-school program at 3500 Lancaster in the CEC building.  Dupree taught in higher education for many years at the University of the Arts and PAFA.  Currently, in addition to the private instruction offered at Dupree Studios, you can take free figure painting classes with Dupree at Fleisher Art Memorial.
Mr. Dupree has used his success as an artist to reinvest in the Philadelphia communities of his roots. There are many well-known examples of that investment, but one example that stands out is his studio in the Mantua neighborhood. His success is a product of the best Philadelphia art institutions, and he is an exemplary model of a Philadelphian investing back in his community. Part of his long term goals, his dream, has been to leave Dupree Studios as a pillar in the Mantua community.

<p>In 2006, schoolteacher Marcel Jean started the Cite Soleil School of Music in Haiti to
combat the traumas of poverty and misery with music and song. The Cite Soleil
School of Music soon became the lifeblood of over 240 children.</p>
<p>As co-founder and director of Give Kids Your Instruments,
a young-budding 501c3 nonprofit based in Brooklyn, NY, my goal is to get
musical instruments to kids who cannot afford them. As an organization, we are also involved in
setting up songwriting and ensemble workshops, recording sessions, and creative
environments for young people in underserved communities to explore and harness the power of music and art.</p>
<p>I see art as foundational to social
change; and I am moved beyond words when I see the tremendous effect
music and arts education has on children living in areas emerging from
conflict.</p>
<p>Over the past year, as Marcel and I have become friends, I have accumulated 20 instruments to donate to the school itself – as
well as over 240 flutes for all 240 kids connected to Marcel Jean, director of Haiti Scholarship Association.</p>
<p>We are in the early stages of creating a partnership
between Haiti Scholarship Association and Give Kids Your Instruments and it is
important for me to travel to Haiti to see the school for myself and assess how best
we can work together.

The Impact You Will Help To Make





1. Instruments:
Clearly, these kids also need food and medical attention, and you cannot eat a saxophone – but a saxophone can help us in less visible ways.
Music helps us deal with the dissonance in our lives. The simple act of blowing through a saxophone creates a safe space to reflect upon and express oneself, and this in turn strengthens our sense of self-reliance and feeling of belonging.
The kids at the Cite Soleil School of Music create a community of support for each other and this inspires and motivates them in the present and impacts the cultural life of Haiti in the long run. 
By contributing you help me bring tools of inspiration and strength to young people that need it most. 
2. Create Partnership 
By creating a partnership between Give Kids Your Instruments and Haiti Scholarship Association, we will be able to help project manage the music/arts program at the new school in the bamboo settlement being built in collaboration with Haiti Renaissance and the MIT architecture department. For more information on the long-term objective, please refer to our website: www.singsoleil.com/partners
3. Document Project  
My goal is to develop accountability with the local community and transparency with the international community. 
This will be the opening chapter to a documentary about the effect of arts education in areas emerging from conflict and the importance of art in cultural development. 
Please take a moment to watch the documentary about the Cite Soleil School of Music:





Risks & Challenges

There are health and safety risks that we are preparing for. The  post-earthquake landscape of Port au Prince can be hard to traverse. Not to mention, extreme levels of poverty and the political uncertainty of Haiti today force us to remain flexible for once we are on the ground we may have to improvise according to the present circumstances in order to achieve the mission. 
Be a part of this journey and allow me to escort you to the heart of Haiti's creative spirit by way of the camera. 
We are using the flexible donations option because every contribution counts. Patrick and I are going to Haiti to do this project by any means necessary.

<h1>Hello! We are Threads. We would like to present our project... <b>Threads on Tour: Pop-up Gallery Project</b>
</h1>
<p>After staging several pop-up art events we are now at the stage where we need to move Threads on, take on new challenges and embark on the journey we created. So we are taking Threads on tour... </p>
<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We offer</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Free opportunities to exhibit work</b> </li>
<li><b>Video Art screenings</b></li>
<li><b>Peer-to-peer work-in-progress crits </b></li>
<li><b>Development workshops </b></li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p><b>Our project is / your money will support:</b></p>
<p>We will use this money to match fund an Arts Council Funding application which will help fill the void between graduating with an Art Degree... and the ""Real World"". We will also be able to <b>purchase the equipment</b> we need to sustain our events and exhibitions on a regular basis. We plan on helping fill this void by offering a funded<b> 3 month placement</b> for an Art-Grad to run regular<b> peer-to-peer work-in-progress groups </b>within their local community. They will be learning on the job <b>business skills</b> as they: Source the venue, advertise to reach out to find the Artists, Budget the pop-up exhibition. As a result they will have more <b>experience </b>to present on their CV. The group they manage will meet on a peer-to-peer level, discussing art work in progress with the aim to produce more work alongside trying to earn a living. They will then celebrate their time together with a pop-up exhibition.</p>
<p><b>If we don't reach our target</b></p>
<p>We will still be able to use any money we raise to support our application to the Arts Council. </p>
<p><b>How will this benefit you and the IMPACT of this project?</b></p>
<p>By creating these pop-up events we <b>boost the cultural drive</b> and excitement for the Arts <b>outside London</b>. We believe that this energy will spark hope in other creatives who lack, or who have lost the confidence to create. We will be able to offer more exhibiting opportunities for Artists and more paid opportunities for those Artists wishing to run workshops etc. with the support of our team. </p>
<p>Moreover, we have a heap of lovely hand-made incentives that we have been working on! As these are limited editions and 1/1's they are incredibly sentimental and high in personal value. </p>
<h1>Perks For YOU! </h1>

Our goal is to raise $20,000 for our studio based out of Denver, Co in the Santa fe Art District that will help us buy materials like spray paint, house paint, rollers, brushes, lifts ect. because the average mural cost us $2000-$7000 (depending on the size of the wall). If you donate $100 dollars you will receive a limited edition print, if you donate $500 you will receive a small original painting, if you donate $1000 you will receive a T-shirt and a small painting, if you donate more than $1000 you will get all of the above and the $10,000 plus backers will receive a large original Koco Collab painting. If we don't hit our goal we will still use the money for as many art materials as we can get our painty little hands on. This project will stop vandalism in areas that are consistently getting tagged and help powerful organizations acquire art bringing attention to what they do in the community. We are working with a couple non profits teaching classes, giving demonstrations, and live painting at various venues around Denver, as well as hanging our work in galleries, at coffeeshops, dance studios, breweries and bars. Your contribution to this project big or small is monumental for not only two female artists but for everyone who enjoys mural art and art in general.  We struggle to make ends meet when we are pouring all our money into supplies, studio rent, and product investment. Sometimes making little to no money on certain projects we spend hours, days, and weeks on. We will keep keepin on and fight to live in our passions before being comfortable because we are creators and fail all the time but always find a solution. If you don't have the money to help that's totally a okay just share and make some noise for us!!! We love everyone who supports our mission!

<h3>Intro and Director Statement</h3>
<p>Hello my name is Hawar Karim, I am now major in Master of Fine Arts in New York Film Academy in Burbank. There is an upcoming student thesis film that begins its production in March which is very essential for me to build a portfolio into my film business career. I hope this campaign can give you an idea what you can see and discover.</p>
<p>The concept of the story is taken by those victims from Iraq who suffered the attack by ISIS's brutality. The war that causes thousands innocent lives show no mercy to this world. Victims who kidnapped by the ISIS are forced to be sex slaves, especially the women and girls. People are losing their strength and soul during the manipulation.</p>
<p>The center of my film is about women and I hope people can hear the voices from the women above the violations. I want to point out that what happen in the story can also be occurring everywhere awarded wars. I also want to point out I come from this background  and I surely understand the feelings when the women are suffering and when they have a child who is about to born into this world.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Use of donations</h3>
<p>As this is a very important project for me, I hope you can help me and my production when we are currently battling out biggest war so far, which is the financial issue.</p>

<p><strong>- Production Team</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Locations and permits</strong></p>
<p><strong>- Camera  &amp; lighting Equipments &amp; Insurance</strong></p>

<p>Based on the script so far, the estimated budget of money will be exceeded over $7,000, which is a very large number for me. </p>
<p>I am in a very harsh situation that I also need to pay the tuition for my current school program. There will be no words to say but only appreciation and thanks to you if you can help me out. </p>
<p>As I have been thinking about this idea for years and i know this is a right time for me to achieve this dream.

<h2>Well on the way to being finished! We now need help paying off the bills.</h2>
<p>This photo is from several days ago and shows the canopy frame disassembled on the deck, the panorama frame is on its pedestal (the viewers, which fit into the openings in the sides, are inside the building and off the construction site to protect them), one of the ""skirts"" to dress the sides of the trailer is in place to show how it will look (all the others are done).

<p>Thanks to one of our build crew - who also happens to be a stereographer - you will be receiving a pair of left - right button badges with which  you can practice your free-viewing skills. Yup, pin them to your jacket either left-right for parallel viewing, or right-left for you cross-eyed viewers, and you will see our logo do magical things. You can start practicing right now - check out the graphic for the buttons shown here in left-right-left form:</p>

<h3>Wondering what all this free-viewing and left-right-left stuff is all about?</h3>
<p>Wonder no more. For a donation of $25 bucks you could get our handy dandy postcard guide to free-viewing (check out the perks below and to the right), and for an extra $25 more we'll send the badges along too! Deal!</p>
<h2><strong>What is this all about?</strong></h2>
<p>Everyone loves optical illusions!  For anyone who has studied vision, or even played around with a plastic View-Master, you know how cool it is to see a photograph in 3D!  In the 1800s, the first stereoscope was invented to trick the eyes into seeing three dimensional images from two slightly offset photos, and thus begun the world’s love affair with 3D imagery. </p>
<p>As a lover of stereoscopes old and new, I decided it would be cool to bring the science of stereoscopic imagery into an interactive mobile art piece that showcases both how these images are created and allows viewers to view our vast collection of new and historic photographs.</p>
<p>We’re excited to bring you the Puddletown Panorama - an art and science exhibit on wheels!</p>
<p>The Puddletown Panorama (PtP) is a multi-station viewing device, inspired by antique stereoviewers and using the format of the stereocard.  And my amazing crew and I are building it right now! For more information about the roots of this project, please take a look at our first IndieGoGo video at <a href=""https://youtu.be/loWE7ByLhlM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://youtu.be/loWE7ByLhlM</a></p>
<p>Up to five people at a time will be able to view unique sets of 3d images in the form of stereocards  at each of the viewing stations. The subject matter will vary, depending on venue and the type of event.  We have received overwhelming interest from fellow stereophotographers who have already started sending their images for inclusion in the Puddletown’s collection of cards, and they will take their place alongside hundreds of historic and antique cards.</p>
<p>This is not a short term project; we intend to grow this venture into the future as our library of images expands, and word spreads of our willingness to bring stereophotography to your community.  Our first outing will be to the Burning Man arts festival in August this year and we just landed our second outing - we have been invited to bring the PtP to Portland's, Mini Maker Faire at the Oregon Museum of Science and Industry in mid-September.</p>
<p>The entire Puddletown Panorama, in a livery of British racing green with cream, dark red and gold trim, has the look of an early 20th cent. circus, or carnival, sideshow with Victorian remnants peeking out around the edges. Illuminated by LED lighting and towed by it's own unique vehicle, the Puddletown Puller, the Puddletown Panorama is decorated with fancy metal work, gilding, hand painted artwork and lettering, the entire piece forming an  intimate space, itself a demonstration of art and craftsmanship in the service of a special type of photography.  Any you can be a part of this by making a donation to our project.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Fundraising #2.</h3>
<p>Our first IndieGoGo campaign for the PtP, back in April this year, raised $4,100 (after fees taken by IndieGoGo and payment processing companies). As we explained back then, this was seed money to get us up and running with materials, equipment and general supplies, and that is exactly how all of that (and nearly as much again) has been spent:</p>
<p>Basic trailer construction and registration - $1,400</p>
<p>Building materials and specialist parts - $3,450</p>
<p>Tools and equipment - $800</p>
<p>Card making supplies - $350</p>
<p>Puller (base vehicle, parts, etc.) - $800</p>
<p>Fundraising rewards (includes stock for future campaigns) and shipping - $1,000</p>
<p><strong>TOTAL SPENT TO DATE = $7,800</strong></p>
<p>While we have the bulk of our materials, we still have things to acquire and on-going expenses; we need a spare wheel and four corner stabilizers for the trailer,  printer ink for the cards, hardware, paint, more printer ink, saw blades, four LED lanterns as emergency lighting in case the generator dies, did we mention printer ink, photo paper for the cards, drill bits, more photo paper, deckstain, etc., etc.  Then there are the transportation costs for the PtP's first outing, to Burning Man.</p>
<p>Our projected total costs will be around $12,000.</p>
<p>So, we are asking for your help in raising at least another $4,000 towards this overall total. $5,000 would be even better!</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What do you get?</h3>
<p>The satisfaction of knowing that you helped out a bunch of talented and passionate builders finance and make a contraption that will be both educational and bring smiles to many faces. Building projects like these also give opportunities for makers to learn new skills while sharing their existing ones with others. These projects foster friendships and cooperation between makers that can last a lifetime, and extend into other parts of their lives and communities, both work related and personal.</p>
<p>But, if that isn't enough, we have perks for you. Some of them were available during our first campaign, but we have added a few new items if you feel the need for a physical token of our thanks for your donation. Please take a look at our offerings described at the bottom of this section. </p>
</div><h3>Want to see how the build is going?</h3><p>Check out our build blog at <a href=""https://www.puddletownpanorama.com/build-blog"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.puddletownpanorama.com/build-blog</a></p><p> </p><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are well on the way to making the Puddletown Panorama a reality. Actually, it <strong>is</strong> a reality, and getting closer to completion everyday. There is little risk involved in backing us; as a crew we are all seasoned, successful builders and makers of similar projects, and many of work in creative day jobs. We have already done much of the primary construction work and are now dealing with the details. You will be backing a winner and making it easier for us to reach completion. Not to mention lightening the financial load that has already accumulated.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Some of you have already supported us with a donation and once again, we thank you.  If you can help out one more time with a few more dollars, that would be fantastic.  </p>
<p>If this project is new to you, or you were waiting to see what we did with the initial funding, how about stepping up and giving us a donation, please?  All offerings, large or small are most welcome.</p>
<p>Whether you are able to help us financially or not, please lend a hand by spreading the word about our project to as many people as possible.  Share it on Facebook, Twitter, whatever is your social media of choice. Email your friends.  IndieGoGo makes this easy through their share tools on this page. </p>

While we have the bulk of our materials, we still have things to acquire and on-going expenses; we need a spare wheel and four corner stabilizers for the trailer,  printer ink for the cards, hardware, paint, more printer ink, saw blades, four LED lanterns as emergency lighting in case the generator dies, did we mention printer ink, photo paper for the cards, drill bits, more photo paper, deckstain, etc., etc.  Then there are the transportation costs for the PtP's first outing, to Burning Man.
Our projected total costs will be around $12,000.
So, we are asking for your help in raising at least another $4,000 towards this overall total. $5,000 would be even better!
 
What do you get?
The satisfaction of knowing that you helped out a bunch of talented and passionate builders finance and make a contraption that will be both educational and bring smiles to many faces. Building projects like these also give opportunities for makers to learn new skills while sharing their existing ones with others. These projects foster friendships and cooperation between makers that can last a lifetime, and extend into other parts of their lives and communities, both work related and personal.
But, if that isn't enough, we have perks for you. Some of them were available during our first campaign, but we have added a few new items if you feel the need for a physical token of our thanks for your donation. Please take a look at our offerings described at the bottom of this section.

Risks & Challenges
We are well on the way to making the Puddletown Panorama a reality. Actually, it is a reality, and getting closer to completion everyday. There is little risk involved in backing us; as a crew we are all seasoned, successful builders and makers of similar projects, and many of work in creative day jobs. We have already done much of the primary construction work and are now dealing with the details. You will be backing a winner and making it easier for us to reach completion. Not to mention lightening the financial load that has already accumulated.

Cutbacks that are forcing many disabled people into poverty. Amy would like to dedicate this play to anyone who has been through the PIP process or has supported someone who has.</p> <p>We are asking you to make whatever donation you can towards putting on the 8 night run of our show at the wonderful Bunker Theatre in London's as part of their Breaking Out season.  A small donation to this show will have a huge impact.</p>
<p>The Bunker Theatre is highly successful fringe venue in the bough Southwark London.  <i>""Celebrating 'The Company' and showcasing BREAKING OUT is a festival of world premiere shows by six of the country's most exciting emerging theatre companies, chosen by The Bunker artistic team from over 45 different projects.

<p>Now let me tell you where your money will be going....</p> <p><strong><u>Access requirements.</u></strong></p>
<p>Libby's Eyes is not like any fringe theatre show because we hope to make it fully accessible. Many disabled people cannot access theatre due to inaccessible venues and shows, they can feel marginalised from being able to experience theatre and we want to change that. Many shows do not have WC access, clear signage, captioning etc-all the things that would allow a person with a disability to experience a theatre production. These are all simple things that can be put into a show at a reasonable cost. People with disabilities can not only experience a show that's accessible for them but one that represents their lives. They can hear and see their voices and lives on stage.  The Bunker is WC access venue and we plan to add captioning, BSL interpreter, touch tours and audio description. </p> <p><strong><u>Rehearsal space</u></strong></p>
<p>Rehearsal space in London is notoriously expensive and we need a safe space to rehearse Libby's Eyes in for our team to get the best results.   By contributing to this you are allowing disabled actors and writer to work in safe functional space that gives them the chance to create the best work they can without hindrances.</p> <p><strong><u>Paying the team</u></strong></p>
<p>Libby's Eyes has a cast of four actors and we believe in paying actors for their work. We want the best out of the team and production and paying actors is simply an obvious way of doing that.  It would set an example in the industry that actors should be paid. </p>
<p>Cast and creative team fees are in line with Equity, ITC and industry standards. We are passionate about increasing the pressence of disabled creatives and performers in theatre, which can only be achieved through better access in terms of disablity and pay. By providing paid work and professional credits we hope to see more disabled performers playing roles of both disabled and non-disabled characters on stage.</p> <p><strong><u>Why donate?</u></strong></p>
<p>Libby's Eyes is more than play.  It is statement on the realities of living with disability in the 21st Century.  Benefit cuts are affecting the quality of life and independence of the its recipients and this is going unnoticed, forcing some into poverty, anxiety and mental health issues as a result of the assessment process.  </p> <p>Life costs you £570 more on average a month if you're disabled.-Scope</p>

It was emotionally draining and left me with very little self-worth.

It takes current issues facing the disabled community and explores them with wit and humour. It experiments with theatrical conventions and re-invents how they can be used to make a play that is fully accessible without those accessible elements feeling like an add-on or afterthought. The play is both comedic medic and touching and does what great plays do best, guiding you to the questions that need to be asked rather than providing you with easy answers.

<h3>Artist's Statement</h3>
<p>Hi, I’m Victor Acevedo. I’ve been a visual artist since 1977 and a digital artist since 1983. Many of you have known me for a long time -- and some of you have met me more recently in the Real-World or on Social Media.<br/><br/>I want to tell you about my IndieGoGo Campaign. I am launching it to raise the funds to self-publish a book.</p>
<p>The book will be called <strong>Acevedo in Context</strong>. It will be a 40-year Art career retrospective; an illustrated chronology about my life and art - with an emphasis on the Art.</p>
<p>It will contain about 250 pages and include many documentary photographs and over 150 reproductions of my paintings, drawings and prints. It will also address my recent ‘<strong>visual music</strong>’ video work. It will include essays by two well-known art writers, who are also historians. Their names will be revealed after the campaign wraps and the commission agreements are signed.</p>
<p>The book<strong> </strong>will cover my work in Traditional media; painting &amp; drawing, starting in 1977 and then into Digital media from 1983, leading up to the present.<br/><br/>The book is called <strong>Acevedo in Context </strong>because it’s not just about me. It is also about the milieu from where I’ve have come;  my early influences and the community around the early digital art movement as it continued to grow and evolve at the dawn of personal computing.<br/><br/>It has been said that my artwork reflects that time; the transition from the 20<sup>th</sup> century into the 21st. That unique ‘moment’ when our collective cybernetic future was being born.</p>
<p><strong>Acevedo in Context</strong> will be published as an eBook and if we raise enough money, it will also be issued as limited-edition soft-cover Print Book.</p>
<p>I hope to raise $25,000 dollars, which will fund every aspect of the project from beginning to end.  Some-of-which will include:</p>
<p>• Converting the original Manuscript to eBook format, for both the iBook and Kindle.</p>
<p>• Executing the first press run for the hardcopy Print Book.</p>
<p>• Commissioning the 2 writers to write the essays.</p>
<p>• Hiring an editor to double-check the copy &amp; formatting and to sculpt the final flow of the book.</p>
<p>• Cover the fees for 3<sup>rd</sup> party IP (intellectual property) which will be important for telling the story in its complete form.</p>
<p>These are just some of the main expenses. To see the complete list, please check out the itemized budget which is posted below.<br/><br/>We’ve got a good solid plan and strategy for Success!<br/><br/>We have a lot of great <strong>perks</strong> at every donation level. Please check them out here on the Campaign page.</p>I hope that you will join-me in this venture and lend your support with a donation-to-the-project. Of-course donations at any level will be helpful toward reaching the funding goal. And who knows, with your help maybe we can <i>even</i> surpass it!<p><br/>As well as donating monetarily, I would like to ask you to help out by spreading the word to your friends. Please share this IndieGoGo-campaign with those who might want to be part of it. Please spread the word by email and sharing on your favorite Social Media. For example, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.</p>
<p>I really need your help to make this campaign go viral! The truth is, it is imperative to get the word out beyond my own mailing list!</p>
<p><strong>Thank you</strong> all in advance, for any and all support that you can bring! Cheers! - Victor<br/> </p>

<h3>The Backstory</h3>

</div><div>
<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p align=""left""><strong><u>Production:</u></strong></p>
<p align=""left"">Once the funds are raised, the commissioned essays will be ‘green lit’ and begun. Simultaneous to this work, all the images and other written material will be formatted in a master inDesign manuscript file. In fact, i have already started collecting together and organizing all this material. You can get a glimpse of this in the video above.</p>
<p>Once the essays are added and the document’s format is fine-tuned. It will be outsourced to two ebook converters. One for iBook format (Apple platform) and one for (Amazon) Kindle which are the 2 formats with the widest distribution channels.</p>
<p>Apart from the eBooks, the first edition of Acevedo in Context will also be issued  as a Print book. The quantity for all 3 formats of the first edition will be 3000 each. The Print book edition will be printed gradually on a print-on-demand (POD) basis 25–100 a time, unless demand warrants larger quantities. I plan to use the POD company called Bookbaby. The print book will be in soft cover and its trim size will be 8.5x11"" landscape. The first edition eBooks will be distributed online, on demand, one-at-a-time, as needed, up to 3000 copies in each format.</p>
<p><u><strong>Distribution</strong>:</u></p>
<p>The first edition of Acevedo in Context as an iBook will be uploaded to the Apple iBooks store.</p>
<p>The first edition of Acevedo in Context in Kindle format will be uploaded to Amazon Books</p>
<p>The first hardcopy book print run of Acevedo in Context will be made available for sale online through Amazon Books.</p>
<p>If all goes well these will be issued by December 2018.</p>
<p>Promotion: Sales and Marketing Efforts:</p>
<p>After the book published, i will be spending as much time as possible, promoting the book in person and online in an all-out grass-roots DIY campaign. If the total funding goal is met I will be able to retain a small PR Firm to help me promote the book for a short time in order to  maximize and expand its audience.<br/> </p>
<h3><strong>Where your donations will go:</strong></h3>
<p>Your contributions are absolutely vital to the execution of this project. We hope to raise  $25,000 USD through this campaign.<br/><br/>Here is the current projected budget:</p>
<p>$4500 Two critical art historical essays $2250 each</p>
<p>$2500 Editor copy + line</p>
<p>$1000 ebook conversion to MOBI (kindle)</p>
<p>$1000 ebook conversion to ePUB (iBook)<br/><br/>$3000 First Print book press run toward complete the Limited edition quantity.</p>
<p>$_295 ISBN numbers and barcodes 10 + 5 barcodes. Each published format of the book will need a unique ISBN number. This is the most economical way to buy ISBNs; the extra ones will not go to waste, they can be used for a future 2nd edition of the book in each format.</p>
<p>$_550 Copyright registration book itself plus 9 sets of images registered separately</p>
<p>$4000 IP rights permission to reproduce work: Escher, Dali, Picasso, Fuller, others (these 3rd party images will greatly enhance the authority and power of the narrative.)</p>
<p>$3355 To retain a PR Firm for a short time to help promote the book.</p>
<p>$1500 Project manager honorarium.</p>
<p>$1000  Production for the Digital Print perks in all sizes:  printing, packaging and shipping fees (projected)<br/><br/>$_750  Credit card charges 3% of total of all money raised = 3% of $25000</p>
<p>$_300 Credit card projected 30¢/transaction (30¢ x 1000 projected transactions)</p>
<p>$1250 IndieGoGo platform fee 5% of $25000</p>
<p><strong>$25,000</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Plan B strategy – funding short fall</strong><br/><br/>As you can see, the budget is well thought out and it will indeed cover the costs of the entire project and the cost of the campaign itself. With your help we will raise the full amount required to produce the book in its deluxe form on 3 platforms. The campaign is in <strong>flex-funding</strong> mode, so whatever amount that is raised I will put toward the project. However, should we fall short of the total target goal, I will adjust the project’s specifications accordingly. In any case, i plan to still issue an eBook; however, one that the raised funds can support. It will most likely be a Kindle eBook. By the way Kindle (mobi) format ebooks can be read on Mac or PCs on IOS and Android tablet Devices, you just need to download the Kindle app to do so.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>Plan C Strategy – exceeding our initial Goal!</strong></p>
<p>Given the range of Donation Levels and Perks, and if we all help to share and endorse the <strong>Acevedo in Context</strong> IndieGoiGo Campaign, there's a good chance that together we will reach the target Goal, and possibly even exceed it!<br/><br/>If that is the case, it will be great for all of us! Depending on how much extra money we raise, i will look seriously into publishing the first print edition in Hard cover and/or increasing the quantity of the first Softcover print run.</p>

<p><strong>Artist’s Short Biography</strong></p>
<p>Victor Acevedo is an artist best known for his digital work involving printmaking and photography. However, since 2007 his primary focus has been working with video and producing visual music works. As an ongoing practice, selected still images from the videos are made available as archival signed limited edition prints.</p>
<p>Acevedo is considered a desktop computer art pioneer as he was an early adopter of pre-Windows personal computer (PC) software to create fine art, in the early 1980s. He now works primarily on the Apple Macintosh platform.</p>
<p>The arc of Acevedo’s career is noteworthy in that it begins in his student phase in 1977 with traditional (analog) media painting and drawing and then shifts starting in 1983 over a three year period to exclusively digital media.</p>
<p>The 3 main periods of Victor Acevedo’s work to date are as follows:<br/><br/>1977- 87: Analog Art: traditional media, painting, drawing &amp; film</p>
<p>1983 to 2007: Digital Art: archival inkjet and photo prints</p>
<p>2007 to present: Visual Music: Digital Video and Digital Prints</p>
<p>Acevedo grew up in Los Angeles, California and attended Art Center College of Design in Pasadena 1979-81.<br/><br/>In early 1995 Victor moved to New York City and became a digital artist in residence in the BFA Computer Art Department at the School of Visual Arts. He began teaching there in 1997 and moved to the Masters level (MFA) program three years later.<br/><br/>In 1996 he created one of his most well know images called The Lacemaker, which he named after the same-titled painting by Johannes Vermeer (1665). This is the image he has chosen for the cover of his book, Acevedo in Context.<br/><br/>Acevedo is now based in Los Angeles having returned to his hometown in the Spring of 2009.<br/><br/>After settling back into LA life, he explored the application of his motion graphic work to live-mix video projection for electronic dance music events, primarily in night club settings. In doing so, he combined his interest in contemporary Electronic Bass music with concepts in Digital Cinema and Synergetic Geometry. His music video work and live  visual (VJ) performances were informed by a synthesis of these traditions, disciplines, phenomenologies.</p>
<p>Since 2014, Acevedo has been exploring the realm of pure abstraction to a greater degree. Thus, establishing a new body of work in parallel to that which addresses figurative subjects.<br/><br/>In late 2015, slipping easily back into the fine-art community, he began showing fairly regularly at the Los Angeles Center for Digital Art (LACDA) in Downtown Los Angeles. Overall, he has shown his work in well over 100 group and solo art exhibitions since 1982.</p>
<p>Acevedo’s work has been featured in several recent art history books. Highlighting a few of them: Acevedo’s image called <i>4D Memory Cluster</i> was reproduced in the book called “<strong>Moving Innovation: A History of Computer Animation</strong>” (Tom Sito, MIT Press, 2013); The Acevedo image called <i>Eric in Orense</i> is reproduced in the book called, “<strong>Art of the Digital Age</strong>”, (edited by Bruce Wands Thames and Hudson, 2006)  This image was also featured in the book’s UK online promotional announcements.</p>
<p>""<strong>Art of the Digital Age</strong>"" has been described as “The first major illustrated survey of this exciting, new, and experimental field”. Acevedo’s work was discussed at some length in the important and influential book called “<strong>From Technological to Virtual Art</strong>”, written by art historian Frank Popper, (MIT Press 2007).<br/><br/>His image called <i>Springside Cynthesis</i> and a descriptive blurb about his work was included in the books called ""<strong>Digital Art</strong>"" (Ullmann/Tandem, 2009) and “<strong>The World of Digital Art</strong>” (h.f.Ullman, 2010) Both are edited by the well-known digital art authority and gallerist, Wolf Lieser. He founded The Digital Art Museum (DAM) Gallery in 1998. It is now located in Berlin.</p>
<p>A self-penned article and several Acevedo images were included in the book and accompanying CD called “<strong>Escher’s Legacy: A Centennial Celebration</strong>” (Doris Schattschneider and Michelle Emmer eds., Springer-Verlag 2002)<br/><br/>As of 2017 he has been slowly venturing into Virtual Reality (VR) working and studying with the well-known and brilliant young underground film director, Michael Woods.</p> <p> </p>
</div></div>","Artist's Statement
Hi, I’m Victor Acevedo. I’ve been a visual artist since 1977 and a digital artist since 1983. Many of you have known me for a long time -- and some of you have met me more recently in the Real-World or on Social Media.I want to tell you about my IndieGoGo Campaign. I am launching it to raise the funds to self-publish a book.
The book will be called Acevedo in Context. It will be a 40-year Art career retrospective; an illustrated chronology about my life and art - with an emphasis on the Art.
It will contain about 250 pages and include many documentary photographs and over 150 reproductions of my paintings, drawings and prints. It will also address my recent ‘visual music’ video work. It will include essays by two well-known art writers, who are also historians. Their names will be revealed after the campaign wraps and the commission agreements are signed.
The book will cover my work in Traditional media; painting & drawing, starting in 1977 and then into Digital media from 1983, leading up to the present.The book is called Acevedo in Context because it’s not just about me. It is also about the milieu from where I’ve have come;  my early influences and the community around the early digital art movement as it continued to grow and evolve at the dawn of personal computing.It has been said that my artwork reflects that time; the transition from the 20th century into the 21st. That unique ‘moment’ when our collective cybernetic future was being born.
Acevedo in Context will be published as an eBook and if we raise enough money, it will also be issued as limited-edition soft-cover Print Book.
I hope to raise $25,000 dollars, which will fund every aspect of the project from beginning to end.  Some-of-which will include:
• Converting the original Manuscript to eBook format, for both the iBook and Kindle.
• Executing the first press run for the hardcopy Print Book.
• Commissioning the 2 writers to write the essays.
• Hiring an editor to double-check the copy & formatting and to sculpt the final flow of the book.
• Cover the fees for 3rd party IP (intellectual property) which will be important for telling the story in its complete form.
These are just some of the main expenses. To see the complete list, please check out the itemized budget which is posted below.We’ve got a good solid plan and strategy for Success!We have a lot of great perks at every donation level. Please check them out here on the Campaign page.I hope that you will join-me in this venture and lend your support with a donation-to-the-project. Of-course donations at any level will be helpful toward reaching the funding goal. And who knows, with your help maybe we can even surpass it!As well as donating monetarily, I would like to ask you to help out by spreading the word to your friends. Please share this IndieGoGo-campaign with those who might want to be part of it. Please spread the word by email and sharing on your favorite Social Media. For example, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc.
I really need your help to make this campaign go viral! The truth is, it is imperative to get the word out beyond my own mailing list!
Thank you all in advance, for any and all support that you can bring! Cheers! - Victor 

The Backstory
I always hoped that someone would come along and want to write a book about my art. Or perhaps i would submit a book proposal to a major art house publisher and wait for their approval.

The first hardcopy book print run of Acevedo in Context will be made available for sale online through Amazon Books.
If all goes well these will be issued by December 2018.
Promotion: Sales and Marketing Efforts:

One year ago I created this Dreamscape Series in honor of my leading muse, the country of France. Through study and exposure to so many aspects of French culture, I have developed and deepened as an artist, steeped in the inspiration from all I have experienced under its influence. This series is my humble attempt at paying homage to this profound source, to which I owe so much.As a Geffen Records recording artist and creative director of surreal theatre troupes Toujours L'Amour and Theatre Marvelosa, I have cultivated a visual world that is a pastiche of performance art, beloved works of literature & film, traveling adventures, observations from everyday life and compelling events in history.Employing a wide array of mediums, I paint dreamworlds that seek to engage and transport. My musical training has deeply influenced my painting practice, and I tap into the language of music as a way to embrace the poetry of light and space. What I am doing and why I need your supportHaving completed the first part of my  Dreamscape painting series, ""Forever Paris,"" (focused on Paris and currently showing at Manhattan's Le Midi), I am now preparing to launch production of phase 2 of the series, entitled ""South"" based entirely on imagery found in The South of France.The South of France is a magical place where life slips into a lower gear and scenes slide by in soft focus: drowsy villages with quaint cafes and winding cobbled alleyways. . .  cool forests stuffed with truffle oaks . . .  lavender, poppy and sunflower fields nestled within orchards of lemon and mandarin . . . craggy coastlines dotted with pastel houses and their shutters of Mediterranean blue. The inspiration for visual artists there is astounding; utterly limitless, which is why it has attracted so many painters throughout time.What your support will coverMy goal is to raise $8,000 to cover all expenses for this project. This money will go directly towards all art supplies/materials, shipping, photography and transportation. The length of this Indiegogo campaign is 60 days, which means I have until September 5 to reach my fund raising goal.The PerksThere are a variety of levels of support that are offered online; from $10 to $1,000. I know that some of you might be uncomfortable contributing online, please let me know and I can provide you with an alternative method of contributing.Risks & ChallengesThere are no risks or complications I can think of except of course those unexpected “acts of God” that sometime get in the way of best made plans.Please know how much I appreciate your contribution/purchase. It validates my efforts and my work. Thank you.Other Ways You Can HelpWhether you can contribute or not, I thank you for your support.

Below is a bit of the story behind that collection. Dreamscape Series - Part 1    ""Forever Paris""      The Background Inhabiting the neighborhoods of Montmartre and Montparnasse, Paris’ first bohemians created a wild-hearted nirvana where they could behave as they chose. Potent and provocative, that mecca was a home for the exotic, the passionate and the free. In flamboyant, often debauched cafes, these visionaries would gather, masterminding art movements that profoundly rocked world culture.Inspired by the timeless layers of eye-popping Boho art posters papered on tattered walls throughout Paris to this day, I created a series of 15 large-scale paintings to pay tribute to the boundless reach of the bohemian spirit. PRESS:Lilo Jones ""Forever Paris"" at Le Midi“An explosion of texture and color, artist Lilo Jones summons dreams onto canvas.  Dipping her brush in champagne, she brings French whimsy to Manhattan’s Le Midi in a show entitled, ""Forever Paris.""

<h3>Resumen</h3>
<p>Hello, my name is Ksenia. I´m a museologist, designer and artist. Currently<br/>I´m living in Madrid and volunteering at ""The Tarot Museum"" (Museo Del Tarot in spanish).</p>
<p>This is a very nice private museum where you can find a lot of different decks from all over the world. The idea to create a tarot deck dedicated to this beautiful city was born in the  museum.</p>
<p>Many tarot decks have been created in honor of different cities among which we know  ""The Tarot of Paris "",""The Tarot of Prague"", etc.  So why don´t we create a deck which would represent the spirit of Madrid?  One deck from Madrid had already existed , it´s beautiful and unique but  it has only 22  major arcana cards and they are quite dark and don´t show  vibrant colors of sunny Madrid. Wheares the deck ""The Tarot of Madrid"" consists of 78 cards, being a full deck with major and minor arcana.  In our project the main goal was to create cards that would tell us the history of the city and not to loose the essence of the cards. A talented artist from Madrid, Carlos Pumariega collaborated in the project of The Museum Of Tarot, Madrid. Carlos, being madridian, could perfectly reflect the mood of the city and the bright colors he uses transmit a lively rhythm of Madrid.</p>

<p><strong>The Project</strong></p>
<p>Funding for this project would provide us a means to print the full 78 card deck ""The Tarot of Madrid"" in the<strong> </strong>edition of 997 decks, work with the artist, graphic designer to make the backside as well as the boxes and short descriptions of the cards at an affordable cost without impacting the quality of production.</p>
<p>The cards will be 7,5 cm x 11 cm, printed on 350 gsm card stock with golden edge.</p>
<p><strong>Costs of production:</strong></p>
<p>Printing of 997 high quality Tarot decks = 12961 Euro</p>
<p>Making high quality packs = 3*997 = 2991 Euro</p>

<div><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>The projects has been completed, all the card images have already been painted and ideas realized. The only missing thing is graphic design of the backside of the cards as well as the box. We are planning to have it done within 2 months. And after that we will be ready to print the decks. This will take 3-4 weeks. Then we will resume the process of shipping it out to you. That is the most risk that you will take! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Artistic works made by a well-known artist greatly increases the value of the project for us. This is another reason why we want this idea to see the world and be rewarded. With everything said above we can admit that the project turned out to be more expensive than it had been expected.  This is why we  decided to reach for funding with hope to make it work out.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We are fully dedicated to getting this project off the ground and releasing the deck by the 11th of September, 2018. If for some reason we don´t get full funding, we will print fewer number of decks and continue looking for other ways of funding. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We assure that this project perks will be created and shipped on time as promised.</div>
<div> </div>
<p><strong>Other ways you can help</strong></p>
<p>Not all of you need  a tarot deck or are into decks, but love to support other artists, that is why we provided the €5 base level of support. But of course, we will be happy if you can contribute more or choose one of the perks!</p>
<p>We would really appreciate it if you helped us spread the word. If you are on a Facebook group for other Tarot lovers, maybe you can tell others about it sharing this campaign.

I was working on a set design for Newsies to take to the Virginia Theatre Association Drama Production competition. I was running the laser tag arena that day, and armed with colored pencils, scale rulers, and graph paper, I was able to create an entire set design for this show by slowly upping the time limits on the arena, minute by minute, just enough so that my boss wouldn’t notice and get me in trouble, but giving me more time between each game to work.

I play on my school’s varsity soccer team as well as participating heavily in our school’s theatre program all while working 20+ hours a week as a Lifeguard at the YMCA and keeping up my 4.5 GPA. I have been drawing and creating things my entire life, it’s what I do best, it’s what I do constantly. Art and performing are the reasons I wake up in the morning and Theatre Production Design is the perfect combination of my love of both.  Last week I was accepted into the Tisch Summer High School Program at New York University.

<p>R Creative Collective (RCC) is a multi-media arts movement founded with the mission of creating space and providing creative outlets for those in search of well-being, growth, and community through creative expression.</p>
</div><div>
<p>For the past year and a half, we have been a mobile team, doing creative expression outreach with local non-profits and recovery organizations. <strong>We have served around 400  individuals through our community partnerships</strong> with The Relatives, Charlotte Rescue Mission, The Blanchard Institute, and Fellowship Hall; not to mention the numerous individuals that we have encountered at pop-up and community events.</p>
<p><strong>We have provided 90% of our services to the community free of charge</strong> and would like to be able to continue providing our services at little to no cost for our charitable community partners through the aid of sponsorship and donations.</p>
<p>We have recently obtained two spaces in a small business incubator called Area 15 located near Uptown Charlotte. <i>R Studio Gallery</i> will open soon as a community gallery and workshop space where we host classes, workshops, and feature local artist’s collections on a rotating basis. The other space is The Rise Boutique, where we work with local business vendors and artisans as a storefront for their products sold on a commission basis, <strong>all of the proceeds from these ventures go to supporting our outreach programs.</strong></p>
<p>We are looking to raise $8-10k to cover startup operations costs for our growing organization, including rent, insurance, supplies and equipment.

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By providing space and workshops focused on encouraging the creative spirit in all of us, we believe that we can be a part of making a change in individuals and communities. We do this by empowering them to use their positive and inspired minds to transform the adverse obstacles that stand before them.</p>
<p>Our variety of creative expression workshops are connecting individuals to an innovative healing process that leads to a more enhanced self-awareness, increased self-confidence, and a strong sense of self-worth that builds resiliency. This has an invaluable effect on the individual and is of great benefit to our community at large. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One of our biggest goals is to keep these workshops affordable and accessible to those in need. We offer regular workshops to our community partners at recovery and at-risk youth centers 100% free of charge. In order to provide quality workshops with quality materials and facilitators, we must depend on donations and sponsors like you to help us continue our work. </p>
<p>We carry this same belief in affordability and accessibility to our public community workshops because people outside or recovery centers and programs also need access to affordable creative outlets; everyone should have access to fun creative outlets, regardless of economic and health circumstances.  We operate our community workshops with a Pay What You Can (PWYC) style alongside a suggested donation price. We offer classes at an average of $15 (USD), which when compared to similar classes offered for $25-$35 (USD). In our classes participants get the same quality experiences they would get elsewhere and save money, while also helping someone else enjoy a class and community they may have otherwise not been able to attend.</p>
<p><i>The suggested donation amount goes directly to operation cost of the class and amounts made over the class costs, go towards our outreach programs. No one gets paid from these funds. </i></p>
<p>We rely heavily on facilitators, many of which offer these same classes at higher prices elsewhere, volunteering their time because they believe in our mission to be able to keep the costs low. Donations made over the suggested amount are welcome and are used to help cover the costs of other guests who can’t afford the fee, therefore, keeping our classes truly accessible to all. </p>
<p>The challenge that we face with this model is, unfortunately, the same that every PWYC business faces; when people don't pay what they can or choose to not to participate with the idea that the product is not as good as a class with a higher price. As an organization, we must absorb those losses and find alternative means of funding and support, so that we can stay true to our goal of providing a wide range of quality inclusive workshops that build up individuals and communities. </p>

<p>Wes Brady lived a life of hard labor. Born enslaved in the 1850s, he worked other people’s land long after his emancipation and up to the time of his death in the early 20th Century.</p>
<p>“I was born and raised in Harrison County, (Texas) and I was 88 years old this July past and has wore myself out here in this county,” he told a reporter for the U.S. Works Progress Administration, Federal Writers' Project in the 1930s.</p>
<p>Like millions of enslaved African Americans, Brady worked for the benefit of others, never realizing the fruits of his labor nor appreciation for his work.  </p>
<p>Unstolen Dignity recognizes the contributions of enslaved Africans like Brady through the beauty of art and narrative. The project calls for the creation of 25 oil portraits. Each painting is designed to show an enslaved person in a dignified light.

</div></div>","Wes Brady lived a life of hard labor. Born enslaved in the 1850s, he worked other people’s land long after his emancipation and up to the time of his death in the early 20th Century.
“I was born and raised in Harrison County, (Texas) and I was 88 years old this July past and has wore myself out here in this county,” he told a reporter for the U.S. Works Progress Administration, Federal Writers' Project in the 1930s.
Like millions of enslaved African Americans, Brady worked for the benefit of others, never realizing the fruits of his labor nor appreciation for his work.  
Unstolen Dignity recognizes the contributions of enslaved Africans like Brady through the beauty of art and narrative. The project calls for the creation of 25 oil portraits. Each painting is designed to show an enslaved person in a dignified light. The goal is to foster a national conversation about the impact of slavery on the wealth of the United States while reaffirming the dignity of enslaved people.
The Unstolen Dignity crowdfunding campaign is raising money to offset the cost of creating and exhibiting the 25 oil portraits. The paintings will be displayed in galleries around the country. A coffee-table book also will be developed from the project.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">A Love Letter Project to Give Earth a Voice</h3>
<p>It is no secret, no surprise that our ecology and our environment are in a precarious position. You are standing in the moment where this problem is so grand that the only solution is to overwhelm it with love and attention. That's what we believe, and we want you to join us. </p>
<p>Have you ever received a love letter? If you have, you know how strong it is. This project is about bottling up the feeling of receiving something special. And sharing that spark of surprise and curiosity with as many people as possible. But this time around, it will be signed ""love, earth"".</p>
<p>We are a group of artists, creators, poets, writers, designers, architects and scientists. We all feel the need to act. But we need your help for one simple thing: </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Join us and write a letter of love from our planet. </i></p>
<p>If you do, you will kickstart the largest love letter collective ever conceived, and help build the beginning of a structure that aims to be the largest physical message of love ever seen on the planet. One that can be seen from space. And one that is supported by thousands of small messages of love.</p>
<p>The beginning of this massive <i>love, earth </i>structure, the centrepiece comma altar, will be built at <strong>Burning Man 2019</strong>. This altar, the comma cathedral will hold your letters of love as a collective symbol until after the event, at which time they will be distributed to their recipients. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564798902/wlho4vvdbcg9kr5tsh29.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Send Love, Signed Earth, to Humanity</h3>
<p>Yes, we plan to build the largest love letter ever conceived. One you can see from space. And we need your help to do it. But first to prove it works, we are calling for a collective grassroots spirit that showcases the emotional and spiritual impact that a small, handheld love letter can have on us.</p>
<p>In order to fulfill the giant-sized, multi-year effort to bring to life the largest love letter ever seen, the soul of the project needs to be supported by a cascade of love letters, signed <i>love, earth</i>. Why? Because a letter the size that we are planning needs to be full of intention. </p>
<p>This is where you come in. We are asking you to contribute to a collection of small, but important messages. The comma cathedral, the structure we are building, needs to be filled with letters from the place we call home. The goal for Burning Man 2019? One thousand letters that each <i>give Earth a voice</i>. With the result being a love letter force that fills the comma cathedral, and after the event, sends out a siren call that inspires and intrigues. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How this Project Works </h3>
<p>This is undoubtably a unique project. The goal: to inspire more people to join the small minority of us making changes to balance society with our ecology. We care deeply. Do you? Here's how <i>love, earth</i> works. </p>
<p>W R I T E R S : </p>
<ol>
<li>We want you to write a super simple message of love, writing of hope, desire for change, call to action, wish, rally cry or dear commitment. Send it to us at letters@signedloveearth.com; </li>
<li>Send your message along with an intended recipient, either in the form of an email address or Instagram handle. You don't need to know the recipient personally, and in fact, that might even be more intriguing; </li>
<li>Donate to the project, picking the reward level that most inspires you; </li>
<li>Your message will be part of a growing collection of letters. We will produce your letter physically, hang it within the comma structure at Burning Man and photograph it within; </li>
<li>Your message will be sent, from @signedloveearth. After the event, you can expect your love letter to be digitally distributed, tagging your recipient. </li>
</ol>
<p>R E C E I V E R S : </p>
<ol>
<li>Receivers are tagged in a digital copy of the letter, addressed to them from Mother Earth, either by email or in Instagram; </li>
<li>Receivers are provided an opportunity to respond and to pass along the gift to another, continuing the chain.</li>
</ol>

<p> </p>
<h3>The Comma Cathedral at Burning Man</h3>
<p>We need your help to build a structure that might just be the largest comma ever constructed, the centrepiece of what aims to be the largest love letter ever conceived. A love letter altar that forms a sacred gathering place for interaction and recommitment. This installation is the coming alive of a cathedral to house your messages of love. <br/> <br/>The comma, one of the most subtly powerful symbols of our written language, typically separates two intentions. It slows the rhythm of the reader. It is signifies emphasis, reminding us what is important. And sets us free in a fleeting moment to ponder what comes next. Looking down from high above the desert, the <i>love, earth</i> comma represents these poetic combinations and marks a passage of transition to the future. One where our atmosphere is carbon negative and our ecology is reset to thrive.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564718720/mz1vcaxek4bgniffh0r0.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Imagine this ethereal emblem emerging as a sanctuary of love in the desert. Inside the structure, we are creating a nexus point to unite written words, emotion and action. A place to channel the most powerful human feeling, that of love, through poem and rhyme, characters and phrases, to better connect all of us to the planet’s urgent siren.</p>
<p>Within the structure, an interactive love letter writing area supports a hanging collection of completed letters that will grow, drawing on you and eventually, citizens of Burning Man, to contribute and collectively display one thousand love letters from Earth, distributed around the world after the event by the artists.</p>
<p>A photogenic and interactive wood CNC structure, this comma cathedral will house your letters. And while it will be packed away after Burning Man 2019, in future years will continue to grow in size and scale, popping up and expanding, until the entire <i>love, earth</i> message can be captured by cameras in orbit around our planet. </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564720009/zfejw3tjexmm8ngfahwr.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<h3>The Future <i>love, earth</i> Expansion </h3>
<p>The beginning stage of <i>love, earth</i> will focus on the creation of the comma cathedral, kickstarting a love letter collection that we hope to grow into one of the largest in the world. With a successful project in August 2019, the group hopes to continue this momentum into the coming years, building the largest physical love letter ever conceived. This expanded structure would be the entire <i>love, earth</i> statement, and would be built so large it could be captured by orbital satellite imagery. </p>
<p>While this next phase of the project may seem outlandish, it is the scale of the creation that holds the potential to inspire a great number of people. Supplied with impressive imagery from above, the project has the potential to turn one thousand love letters into ten thousand. From ten thousand to one million. And inspire action on a large scale. </p>
<p>This project is important to the environmental problem we face as a society. We need to make the problem real for others, and to overwhelm it with love. Help create the largest love letter ever conceived, spreading love at a scale of massive proportions. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564717380/h7w4dngsiaxh5omgcmeq.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Romantic Inspiration </h3>
<p>This project originated as inspired art to a unique wedding. Having decided that the Black Rock Desert would be the location of their official union after thirteen years together, two of the lead artists, Dawn and Jordan, asked ""how could we share what we have between us, with everyone?"" </p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>""It is a gift Dawn has consistently surprised me with for the entirety of our relationship. Small, handwritten love letters appear everywhere and consistently in my life. On my desk, inside my travel bags and in the most random locations. Always short, romantic and caring, they always remind me that Dawn and I are connected with a most unique love, a bond that only the two of us know."" </i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>""When we set out to get married at Burning Man, this was a way for me to honour our relationship in the grandest way possible. But more so, this artistic idea allowed both Dawn and I the ability to share one of the most intimate parts of our relationship with those who choose to take part. An interactive gift you can pass along to others, simply by surprising them with a message of love. I wanted to share with the world the feeling of receiving unexpected affection in the form of a letter. A feeling I know so well, and an emotion that I feel has the potential to change so much.""</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>""Yet after talking with others, we all felt that focusing the outward energy, positivity and spirit on the biggest problem of our time: catastrophic environmental changes. There's a big group of us who believe we just need to be reminded of the deep connection each one of us shares with Mother Nature. It's when we are aware of this love and connection that good things happen."" - Jordan Kallman</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564717400/kvvlh5hoqeax2dbptw2m.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Project Creatives </h3>
<p>While the union of Dawn and Jordan inspired the project, there is a large collective of creatives behind the project. The group is made up of people with a track record of delivering complex projects at significant scale. But most importantly, this is a group of dreamers who believe that love might be the easiest way to unlock a solution to our biggest problems. </p>
<p>For the past ten years, Jordan Kallman has co-led his event design and experiential agency, The Social Concierge. Since the agency's inception, Jordan has been responsible for the successful creation of ten annual cultural festivals and events, each one ranging in size initially from a few hundred to many thousands. In 2016, he co-created the largest dinner party in his country's history with over 7,000 diners attending a pop-up dinner on a single evening. A selection of his work can be found in highlights below. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564717530/bmrrdnczej4j5soeehi3.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Michael Green is an award-winning architect known for his research, leadership, and advocacy in promoting the use of wood, new technology and innovation in the built environment. He lectures internationally on the subject, including his TED talk, “Why We Should Build Wooden Skyscrapers.” </p>
<p>Stuart Lodge, an emerging expert at the intersection of robotics, 3D printing and wood products, is the lead designer of the love, earth comma cathedral. Having designed a number of wooden CNC pavilions for the TED Conference over the years, Stuart expertise was perfect for the love, earth comma cathedral. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564717564/kxc7hw4lr2vaki4w0re3.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Other artists and poets involved in the project include visual designer Matt Wood, creative mind Briony Crane and serial entrepreneur, Dorian Banks. The project includes a number of renowned poets, who have committed to writing letters of love and will include physical pieces within the comma cathedral itself. </p>

<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>In order to create the comma altar and to execute the project, we are looking for two things: </p>
<ol>
<li>Funding to assist with the project's material and fabrication costs</li>
<li>Love letters, sent to us by you, to hang within the structure and start the movement</li>
</ol>
<p>P R O J E C T   C O S T S :</p>
<p>The project's total cost is in excess of $40,000 USD, without accounting for the many contributions provided by our collective of designers, artists, engineers and builders. We are looking to raise $18,000+ USD to cover the costs of materials and fabrication alone. This budget breaks down as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>300 sheets of 1/2"" plywood: $10,000</li>
<li>Hardware and fasteners: $2,000 </li>
<li>CNC wood cut fabrication of all plywood: $9,000 </li>
<li>Physical love letters, grommets and wind proof hang system: $1,200</li>
<li>Shipping, logistics and movement: $7,300</li>
<li>Lighting and power generation: $1,800</li>
</ul>
<p>This equates to a stack of sustainably sourced plywood two stories high, twenty thousand screws, hundreds of hours of CNC cutting machine time, thousands of physical love letters, a 40' sea container and theatrical lighting to give this structure a nighttime glow. All human effort to the project is being donated, including designers, engineers, architects, build crew, photographers and dreamers. </p>
<p>The funds that are raised will go towards the project's cost. Whatever budget gap remains will be covered by the lead artists of the project. If more than the project's costs are raised, any excess funding will be used to fund the larger installation in future years, creating the largest physical love letter ever conceived. To ensure the most sustainable outcome, any excess dollars this year will be channelled first to plant trees and ultimately offset atmospheric carbon of this year's installation. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>Aside from the campaign rewards, you get to take part in the beginning of a special effort. Initial project backers and letter writers, will be highly cherished by the project artists and will be represented moving forward as initial founders. We encourage you to be part of this journey with us. </p>
<p>This project is deeply connected to the arts, to design and to the love of writing. Because of this root connection, the project rewards are broken down into three main categories.  </p>
<p>R E W A R D S   C A T E G O R I E S :</p>
<ul>
<li>Signed books and unique collectables from our roster of best-selling authors and poets; </li>
<li>Special edition and single print run photography, plans, schematics, accessories and engravings of the <i>love, earth</i> comma altar; </li>
<li>Unique ways to integrate your contributions at the <i>love, earth</i> altar, from having your name engraved on the structure as a founding member to experiencing a one-of-a-kind dinner within the art piece.</li>
</ul>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564717607/uijtpghmvgiveckvtugz.png"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p><i>love, earth</i> is a passion-filled art project. But of course, any one-of-a-kind art project is fraught with risk. Not to mention, the <i>love, earth</i> structure is being built in the middle of the Black Rock Desert, one of the most unforgiving environments on the planet. </p>
<p>Risks and challenges include construction delays, severe weather, assembly issues and potential lag in sending out the letters of love after Burning Man. Having a lead artist who is a seasoned veteran of event and festival productions, someone who regularly operates on a condensed timeline, will help to ensure the project remains on-track. A dedicated and experienced build crew made up of carpenters and technicians will also ensure a committed culture, one that will see the end project through to a positive conclusion. The project is supported by registered architects and engineers who build some of the world's tallest wood structures. </p>
<p><i>love, earth</i> is a risky endeavour, but with the help of funding from generous backers, this project has enormous potential to grow into the future. We welcome you to our community of creatives in spreading love, and in doing so, we will build momentum, overcoming challenges as a collective. </p>
<p> </p>

The Comma Cathedral at Burning Man
We need your help to build a structure that might just be the largest comma ever constructed, the centrepiece of what aims to be the largest love letter ever conceived. A love letter altar that forms a sacred gathering place for interaction and recommitment. This installation is the coming alive of a cathedral to house your messages of love.  The comma, one of the most subtly powerful symbols of our written language, typically separates two intentions. It slows the rhythm of the reader. It is signifies emphasis, reminding us what is important. And sets us free in a fleeting moment to ponder what comes next. Looking down from high above the desert, the love, earth comma represents these poetic combinations and marks a passage of transition to the future. One where our atmosphere is carbon negative and our ecology is reset to thrive.

Imagine this ethereal emblem emerging as a sanctuary of love in the desert. Inside the structure, we are creating a nexus point to unite written words, emotion and action. A place to channel the most powerful human feeling, that of love, through poem and rhyme, characters and phrases, to better connect all of us to the planet’s urgent siren.
Within the structure, an interactive love letter writing area supports a hanging collection of completed letters that will grow, drawing on you and eventually, citizens of Burning Man, to contribute and collectively display one thousand love letters from Earth, distributed around the world after the event by the artists.
A photogenic and interactive wood CNC structure, this comma cathedral will house your letters. And while it will be packed away after Burning Man 2019, in future years will continue to grow in size and scale, popping up and expanding, until the entire love, earth message can be captured by cameras in orbit around our planet. 


 
The Future love, earth Expansion 
The beginning stage of love, earth will focus on the creation of the comma cathedral, kickstarting a love letter collection that we hope to grow into one of the largest in the world. With a successful project in August 2019, the group hopes to continue this momentum into the coming years, building the largest physical love letter ever conceived. This expanded structure would be the entire love, earth statement, and would be built so large it could be captured by orbital satellite imagery. 
While this next phase of the project may seem outlandish, it is the scale of the creation that holds the potential to inspire a great number of people. Supplied with impressive imagery from above, the project has the potential to turn one thousand love letters into ten thousand. From ten thousand to one million. And inspire action on a large scale. 
This project is important to the environmental problem we face as a society. We need to make the problem real for others, and to overwhelm it with love. Help create the largest love letter ever conceived, spreading love at a scale of massive proportions. 

 
The Romantic Inspiration 
This project originated as inspired art to a unique wedding. Having decided that the Black Rock Desert would be the location of their official union after thirteen years together, two of the lead artists, Dawn and Jordan, asked ""how could we share what we have between us, with everyone?"" 
""It is a gift Dawn has consistently surprised me with for the entirety of our relationship. Small, handwritten love letters appear everywhere and consistently in my life. On my desk, inside my travel bags and in the most random locations. Always short, romantic and caring, they always remind me that Dawn and I are connected with a most unique love, a bond that only the two of us know."" 
""When we set out to get married at Burning Man, this was a way for me to honour our relationship in the grandest way possible. But more so, this artistic idea allowed both Dawn and I the ability to share one of the most intimate parts of our relationship with those who choose to take part. An interactive gift you can pass along to others, simply by surprising them with a message of love. I wanted to share with the world the feeling of receiving unexpected affection in the form of a letter. A feeling I know so well, and an emotion that I feel has the potential to change so much.""
""Yet after talking with others, we all felt that focusing the outward energy, positivity and spirit on the biggest problem of our time: catastrophic environmental changes. There's a big group of us who believe we just need to be reminded of the deep connection each one of us shares with Mother Nature. It's when we are aware of this love and connection that good things happen."" - Jordan Kallman

 
Project Creatives 
While the union of Dawn and Jordan inspired the project, there is a large collective of creatives behind the project. The group is made up of people with a track record of delivering complex projects at significant scale. But most importantly, this is a group of dreamers who believe that love might be the easiest way to unlock a solution to our biggest problems. 
For the past ten years, Jordan Kallman has co-led his event design and experiential agency, The Social Concierge. Since the agency's inception, Jordan has been responsible for the successful creation of ten annual cultural festivals and events, each one ranging in size initially from a few hundred to many thousands. In 2016, he co-created the largest dinner party in his country's history with over 7,000 diners attending a pop-up dinner on a single evening. A selection of his work can be found in highlights below. 

Michael Green is an award-winning architect known for his research, leadership, and advocacy in promoting the use of wood, new technology and innovation in the built environment. He lectures internationally on the subject, including his TED talk, “Why We Should Build Wooden Skyscrapers.” 
Stuart Lodge, an emerging expert at the intersection of robotics, 3D printing and wood products, is the lead designer of the love, earth comma cathedral. Having designed a number of wooden CNC pavilions for the TED Conference over the years, Stuart expertise was perfect for the love, earth comma cathedral. 

Other artists and poets involved in the project include visual designer Matt Wood, creative mind Briony Crane and serial entrepreneur, Dorian Banks. The project includes a number of renowned poets, who have committed to writing letters of love and will include physical pieces within the comma cathedral itself. 

 

What We Need
In order to create the comma altar and to execute the project, we are looking for two things: 

Funding to assist with the project's material and fabrication costs
Love letters, sent to us by you, to hang within the structure and start the movement

P R O J E C T   C O S T S :
The project's total cost is in excess of $40,000 USD, without accounting for the many contributions provided by our collective of designers, artists, engineers and builders. We are looking to raise $18,000+ USD to cover the costs of materials and fabrication alone. This budget breaks down as follows: 

300 sheets of 1/2"" plywood: $10,000
Hardware and fasteners: $2,000 
CNC wood cut fabrication of all plywood: $9,000 
Physical love letters, grommets and wind proof hang system: $1,200
Shipping, logistics and movement: $7,300
Lighting and power generation: $1,800

This equates to a stack of sustainably sourced plywood two stories high, twenty thousand screws, hundreds of hours of CNC cutting machine time, thousands of physical love letters, a 40' sea container and theatrical lighting to give this structure a nighttime glow. All human effort to the project is being donated, including designers, engineers, architects, build crew, photographers and dreamers. 
The funds that are raised will go towards the project's cost. Whatever budget gap remains will be covered by the lead artists of the project. If more than the project's costs are raised, any excess funding will be used to fund the larger installation in future years, creating the largest physical love letter ever conceived. To ensure the most sustainable outcome, any excess dollars this year will be channelled first to plant trees and ultimately offset atmospheric carbon of this year's installation. 
 
What You Get
Aside from the campaign rewards, you get to take part in the beginning of a special effort. Initial project backers and letter writers, will be highly cherished by the project artists and will be represented moving forward as initial founders. We encourage you to be part of this journey with us. 
This project is deeply connected to the arts, to design and to the love of writing. Because of this root connection, the project rewards are broken down into three main categories.  
R E W A R D S   C A T E G O R I E S :

Signed books and unique collectables from our roster of best-selling authors and poets; 
Special edition and single print run photography, plans, schematics, accessories and engravings of the love, earth comma altar; 
Unique ways to integrate your contributions at the love, earth altar, from having your name engraved on the structure as a founding member to experiencing a one-of-a-kind dinner within the art piece.


 
Risks and Challenges
love, earth is a passion-filled art project. But of course, any one-of-a-kind art project is fraught with risk. Not to mention, the love, earth structure is being built in the middle of the Black Rock Desert, one of the most unforgiving environments on the planet. 
Risks and challenges include construction delays, severe weather, assembly issues and potential lag in sending out the letters of love after Burning Man. Having a lead artist who is a seasoned veteran of event and festival productions, someone who regularly operates on a condensed timeline, will help to ensure the project remains on-track. A dedicated and experienced build crew made up of carpenters and technicians will also ensure a committed culture, one that will see the end project through to a positive conclusion. The project is supported by registered architects and engineers who build some of the world's tallest wood structures. 
love, earth is a risky endeavour, but with the help of funding from generous backers, this project has enormous potential to grow into the future. We welcome you to our community of creatives in spreading love, and in doing so, we will build momentum, overcoming challenges as a collective. 
 

Other Ways You Can Help
We know not everyone is able to donate. We welcome all. If you feel inspired and simply want to write a love letter from earth to someone, send it to us at letters@signedloveearth.com. We will ensure it is included in the project. 
Please follow along at @signedloveearth and of course please share this campaign if you appreciate what we are trying to do. 
Join us and write a letter of love from our planet.

<p>I’ve been a single, full-time working parent for 18 years. With limited supports and resources and a child diagnosed with type-1 diabetes as a baby, best-interest dictated choices that took me away from my creative network and trajectory at the time, down a long path of challenges and into a career of social service and advocacy, which I am also passionate about!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I never fully quit creating, nor gave up on one day returning to my roots in clay and as a maker, whenever that became possible. I thought that would be a few years. It turned out to be quite a few more! My son just graduated high school and we are both taking advantage of this moment to transition into our new independence before he goes to college. For me, that’s in the form of an intentional restructuring of my life and work.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567809433/hriv0ksz8d6qkceld4tj.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I’ve spent the past two years preparing for this transition by simultaneously completing a master’s degree in sociology and working in clay again, looking for my path back into the world of ceramics. I’ve always envisioned an eventual marriage of my two career paths, but where I need and want to catch up is in my craft!</p>
<p>Happily, what I’m doing now allows me to satisfy both my artist and sociologist sides. I’m fully immersed in the culture of the small community where I’m staying during my time here, where I am generally the only non-Peruvian. I’m walking distance from the studio, able to live simply, and highly engaged with the natural environment around me. I’m also connected to a nonprofit home for boys near where I live, where I completed volunteer fieldwork towards my master’s degree and where I may have the potential to offer clay workshops in the future.</p>
<p>I'm grateful and blessed to be doing what I am doing and excited to see where it takes me. With your help, I look forward to finding out where that is.</p>

The good news is these challenges are all manageable, just a bit slower to work through than I would like. Additionally, they are enhancing my problem-solving skills and depth of experience!
A Little More of My Story
Thank you for staying with me this far and thank you (hopefully) for your support!
Here's a bit more about me, if you're feeling it.
I’ve been a single, full-time working parent for 18 years. With limited supports and resources and a child diagnosed with type-1 diabetes as a baby, best-interest dictated choices that took me away from my creative network and trajectory at the time, down a long path of challenges and into a career of social service and advocacy, which I am also passionate about!
I never fully quit creating, nor gave up on one day returning to my roots in clay and as a maker, whenever that became possible. I thought that would be a few years. It turned out to be quite a few more! My son just graduated high school and we are both taking advantage of this moment to transition into our new independence before he goes to college. For me, that’s in the form of an intentional restructuring of my life and work.

I’ve spent the past two years preparing for this transition by simultaneously completing a master’s degree in sociology and working in clay again, looking for my path back into the world of ceramics. I’ve always envisioned an eventual marriage of my two career paths, but where I need and want to catch up is in my craft!
Happily, what I’m doing now allows me to satisfy both my artist and sociologist sides. I’m fully immersed in the culture of the small community where I’m staying during my time here, where I am generally the only non-Peruvian. I’m walking distance from the studio, able to live simply, and highly engaged with the natural environment around me. I’m also connected to a nonprofit home for boys near where I live, where I completed volunteer fieldwork towards my master’s degree and where I may have the potential to offer clay workshops in the future.
I'm grateful and blessed to be doing what I am doing and excited to see where it takes me. With your help, I look forward to finding out where that is.",14.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Welcome to the Black Arctic.</h2>
<p>The <strong>Black Arctic </strong>is an ongoing art research project developed during my master's thesis while at the Sandberg Academie in Amsterdam. It is a speculative region established by slaves lost to sea during the slave trade who then, after drifting northwards of the Middle Passage (the  route in the North Atlantic used during the slave trade) and build their own civilization. It features its own mythologies, its own heros, its own style of music, its own style of art.</p>
<p>In other words, it is an <strong>afrofuturist dream.</strong></p>
<p>I'm using it to develop new methods of discussing the current state of Blackness and Black being through art, music, spoken word, and film. Much like Sun Ra's <i>Space is the Place</i>, the Black Arctic provides a transformative space outside of colonialism and allows for radical methods of thought, creation, and critique.  I want to study the evolution of our culture through the sheer act of <i>producing culture itself</i> in colonial-free context. </p>
<p>As a major part of this research and project, I will traveling to the Arctic ocean later this year as a part of an art/science expedition that will last three weeks.<br/><br/><i>And it will be amazing. </i><br/>I will conduct field research and recordings, I will map geography, I will run around atop of a glacier and commune with the spirit of climate change. But most importantly,</p>
<h3>I will be making a short film about the Black Arctic.</h3>
<p>This film will contain two spoken word performances; <i>Sirens</i> and <i>The Death of Darius P. Jenkins (and his life thereafter).<strong> </strong></i>Both of which are performed by the emissary of the Black Arctic, Darius P. Jenkins.</p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">Lithography is a process that is done traditionally using limestone as the matrix for printing. The basis of the process is the rejection of water by oil. Lithography is a planographic process and these stones can be used over and over again by graining off the surface of the stone. The image is created by an artist on the surface using greasy materials and then etched to create a grease loving reservoir just under the surface of the stone. By keeping the stone wet and using oil based ink, one can create multiples prints off the surface of the stone! Lithography is used in the contemporary art world as a fine arts printing process.</p>
