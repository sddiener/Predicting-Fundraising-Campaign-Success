<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Aloha!</p>
<p>I'm a Vancouver based professional actor and writer, and the producer/director of ""Evil Fucking Pricks"", a short film about two despicable social deviants that attempt to summon a demon for their own selfish gain and quickly discover why that's often a very bad idea. While this is the 3rd short film I've completed, it is the 1st I've felt confident enough with to submit to the worldwide festival circuit.</p>
<p>The purpose of this campaign is to raise funds for festival related expenses we had not originally budgeted for. Our team is very pleased with the results of our ultra low-budget effort and the reception it has had thus far has been unexpected. Having already been selected as a finalist in the first festival we entered we are now of the opinion that a more robust festival strategy may help our film (and the fine work of our cast and crew) gain the attention they deserve.  With your help of course.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This is what we need, and what we can offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>The cost of attaining the rights to the music we've chosen for the film will be approximately $1600 CAD. Getting this track cleared is probably our biggest concern, as it is a requirement of almost every festival that we do so.  </li>
<li>Closed Captioning is another requirement (especially of many of the higher profile festivals) and another means of reaching a wider audience so this is another expense we'd like to afford. Est. $50 CAD.</li>
<li>The largest expense will be festival entry fees. Our feeling is that a minimum of $5000 is required in order to not only cover basic entry fees but the extra fees required to have our cast and crew considered for the awards and prizes for which they are eligible. </li>
<li>The perks that we can offer range from a simple social media shout-out for a minimum donation, to an associate producer credit for the top tier.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contributions (small or large) will go a long way towards pushing our film over the top in terms of exposure. I'm actually incredibly proud of everyone's contribution to this film, many of whom volunteered their time and services to make it happen. It would be immensely satisfying to be able to put their work before as wide an audience as possible and have them submitted for as many awards and prizes as they are eligible for because gosh darn it...they deserve it.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Greetings,  Lovers of Independent Movies!</p>
<p><strong>We are​</strong>    <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631132344/qx6nmfcrncwvodeex3eu.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>and we are in the business of spirited, raw &amp; triumphant filmmaking!</strong></p>
<p>Our film - <strong>SAINT</strong> - <strong>A</strong> <strong>TRUE STORY</strong> - is an intimate, earthy film about the Spanish Mystic, Saint Teresa of Ávila, a barefoot rebel nun, who is pitted against the formidable one-eyed Princess of Eboli and her friends, the omnipotent Spanish Inquisition. </p>
<p><strong>SAINT</strong> is a <strong>low-budget independent film</strong> that brings together the most collaborative and innovative minds in the industry. It is a 16th century Renaissance history piece lifted out of its stifling context with a <strong>stripped, simplistic style.</strong> The film will be shot in a <strong>timeless place</strong> covered in grit and dust, in the spirit of the spaghetti western.</p>
<p>The soundtrack will be contemporary <strong>gypsy blended with the ethereal</strong>. Music will be composed by Lili Haydn, the Jimi Hendrix of the violin!<strong> </strong>She breaks violin strings all the time!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking to <strong>raise development funds - $50,000</strong> -  to bring on board two exciting independent film producers. They have collectively produced films with <strong>Annette Bening, Judi Dench, Saoirse Ronan and Emily Watson</strong>. These ladies of quality will run with the money you give us, and produce the best team possible from their network!  Edison and I will work alongside them, we are the Creative Producers with the Vision. We are also inviting other investors and producers to join us. Reach out to us at Rosarium Films in Los Angeles. </p>
<p>Know that, even though our film is an intimate film with no overproduced sets or hundreds of extras, it will be of the <strong>highest integrity and quality</strong>. </p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Why a film about Saint Teresa of Ávila?</p>
<p>As the collective <strong>voice of women</strong> is starting to rise in the world, we want to contribute to that voice. No-one better than a <strong>free-spirited barefoot nun</strong> with Godlike passion - to lead an army of nuns to <strong>empower</strong> themselves, at a time when men dominated and kept women silent. </p>
<p>We need more films about <strong>women who are heroes</strong>, who are strong, <strong>who live fiercely</strong>!</p>
<h3><strong>Our Backstory</strong></h3>
<p>This film has come a long way. It started as a play, called <strong>God's Gypsy, </strong>and<strong> premiered in Los Angeles</strong> to great acclaim and controversy. People loved it or hated it! Why? Because we portrayed this <strong>saint as a woman</strong>, a human with all her faults, and in all her glory, just as she had documented so prolifically in all her books and in over 17 000 letters!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631134397/drfjjt5kpcpc3yvnlnah.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631154556/pemhaipl0bkaa5yrxfi8.jpg"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631154851/xspvzccacmlv0vxhaui7.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We visited <strong>Georgetown University</strong> and lectured and performed our hearts out, making men in our audiences cry with compassion, and women laugh and nod their heads in understanding.</p>
<p><strong>Everyone who saw the play wanted it to become a film. </strong></p>
<p>So, we started the arduous journey into the film world.</p>
<p>It takes a lot of people, talent, skills and money to make a good film. It is extremely difficult, but <strong>we persevered</strong>. After years of trying to find just the right screenwriter, we at Rosarium Films ended up knowing we had to write the film ourselves. <strong>No-one knew as much as we knew about our beloved Saint Teresa!</strong></p>
<p>So, we took a year to write the story - through financial difficulty and with many obstacles in our way. But <strong>we persevered</strong>. Just as we were about to go into pre-production on our film, the world stopped due to the Corona virus. It gave us time to research the film industry, to polish the script and to plot our plan.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631154914/zpowlzgn5nywoqhqq6qh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Now, the time is finally here! The film industry has started up again, we have circulated our screenplay, and the response is overwhelmingly positive! <strong>Apparently we have gold.</strong> But because we are not movie stars, we have to prove that we have an audience backing us on this film.</p>
<p>So, it looks like our film <strong>will be made by the people for the people</strong>. This film is <strong>a women's film</strong>, featuring <strong>two female leads</strong>, <strong>written and produced by a woman</strong>, <strong>music composed by a woman</strong>, and who knows, might also be directed by a woman. And the producers who will run with the funds and gather the rest of the team? <strong>Women!</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1631139660/gsp1mlkwk8nv6onvhzkt.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are lucky to live in Los Angeles where we have befriended many wonderful people in the film industry over the years. We have an excellent creative team assembled. <strong>SPIRITED, RAW &amp; TRIUMPHANT</strong> is our motto.</p>
<p>We have become experts in risk taking and in facing challenges! Know that we will not rest until SAINT is made, and it will be in 2022. However ... we cannot make this film without you!!! Please become a part of our crusade. <strong>SHARE our film </strong>with everyone you know, por favor! </p>
<p><strong>Our goal</strong> is for you to be able to watch SAINT at our Premiere, in a film theater near you, or streamed, wherever you are before the year 2022 is out!</p>

Greetings,  Lovers of Independent Movies!
We are​    
and we are in the business of spirited, raw & triumphant filmmaking!
Our film - SAINT - A TRUE STORY - is an intimate, earthy film about the Spanish Mystic, Saint Teresa of Ávila, a barefoot rebel nun, who is pitted against the formidable one-eyed Princess of Eboli and her friends, the omnipotent Spanish Inquisition. 
SAINT is a low-budget independent film that brings together the most collaborative and innovative minds in the industry. It is a 16th century Renaissance history piece lifted out of its stifling context with a stripped, simplistic style. The film will be shot in a timeless place covered in grit and dust, in the spirit of the spaghetti western.
The soundtrack will be contemporary gypsy blended with the ethereal. Music will be composed by Lili Haydn, the Jimi Hendrix of the violin! She breaks violin strings all the time!


What We Need & What You Get
We are looking to raise development funds - $50,000 -  to bring on board two exciting independent film producers. They have collectively produced films with Annette Bening, Judi Dench, Saoirse Ronan and Emily Watson. These ladies of quality will run with the money you give us, and produce the best team possible from their network!  Edison and I will work alongside them, we are the Creative Producers with the Vision. We are also inviting other investors and producers to join us. Reach out to us at Rosarium Films in Los Angeles. 
Know that, even though our film is an intimate film with no overproduced sets or hundreds of extras, it will be of the highest integrity and quality. 

Our friends are all rallying around us to bring their various talents to the perk table. Feast your eyes, and take a pick, or two or three.
But most importantly, it will be SAINT TERESA you will be a part of. Step into her sphere of influence. It is mighty!


The Impact
Why a film about Saint Teresa of Ávila?
As the collective voice of women is starting to rise in the world, we want to contribute to that voice. No-one better than a free-spirited barefoot nun with Godlike passion - to lead an army of nuns to empower themselves, at a time when men dominated and kept women silent. 
We need more films about women who are heroes, who are strong, who live fiercely!
Our Backstory
This film has come a long way. It started as a play, called God's Gypsy, and premiered in Los Angeles to great acclaim and controversy. People loved it or hated it! Why? Because we portrayed this saint as a woman, a human with all her faults, and in all her glory, just as she had documented so prolifically in all her books and in over 17 000 letters!

We visited Georgetown University and lectured and performed our hearts out, making men in our audiences cry with compassion, and women laugh and nod their heads in understanding.
Everyone who saw the play wanted it to become a film. 
So, we started the arduous journey into the film world.
It takes a lot of people, talent, skills and money to make a good film. It is extremely difficult, but we persevered. After years of trying to find just the right screenwriter, we at Rosarium Films ended up knowing we had to write the film ourselves. No-one knew as much as we knew about our beloved Saint Teresa!
So, we took a year to write the story - through financial difficulty and with many obstacles in our way. But we persevered. Just as we were about to go into pre-production on our film, the world stopped due to the Corona virus. It gave us time to research the film industry, to polish the script and to plot our plan.

Now, the time is finally here! The film industry has started up again, we have circulated our screenplay, and the response is overwhelmingly positive! Apparently we have gold. But because we are not movie stars, we have to prove that we have an audience backing us on this film.
So, it looks like our film will be made by the people for the people. This film is a women's film, featuring two female leads, written and produced by a woman, music composed by a woman, and who knows, might also be directed by a woman. And the producers who will run with the funds and gather the rest of the team? Women!


Risks & Challenges
We are lucky to live in Los Angeles where we have befriended many wonderful people in the film industry over the years. We have an excellent creative team assembled. SPIRITED, RAW & TRIUMPHANT is our motto.
We have become experts in risk taking and in facing challenges! Know that we will not rest until SAINT is made, and it will be in 2022. However ... we cannot make this film without you!!! Please become a part of our crusade. SHARE our film with everyone you know, por favor! 
Our goal is for you to be able to watch SAINT at our Premiere, in a film theater near you, or streamed, wherever you are before the year 2022 is out!

Our Team Members:
Coco Blignaut - Producer, Writer, Actress: I am an accidental producer who would rather act, write or sit under a tree, but I must have SAINT made, so I have thrown myself in - balls to the wall, is what they hear me say everyday. 
#drivenbyasaint

Edison Park - Producer, Writer, Actor:  I am ecstatic to be a part of this beautiful and dynamic team. It is either a zen garden or an awesome tempest over here at Rosarium Films, and I wouldn't have it any other way! 

Marlé Blignaut - Production Assistant:  Hi! I’m Marlé Blignaut. I’m a practical and reliable person. People can depend on me. I’m asked by this team to do all sorts of things, like ironing nun's habits, being a script reader. Imagine me lying on the ground prompting the lines to the actors. You want it done, I’m your girl! I’m also a qualified barber with a loyal clientele.  
Yvette Blignaut - In-House DJ:  Hi, I am abnormally normal but insanely obsessed with music. The 80’s decade rocks, right? I love puns, but I prefer my puns to be intended. I am a professional over thinker which causes me many wasted hours.  I am also a money-girl. Never be late, because time is money so don’t mess with mine. Pugs, heck yes!

Yohan de Silva - Graphic Designer: We are so lucky to have discovered Yohan! Very intuitive, willing, supremely talented, and a must-have at Rosarium Films.  He says, ""I love to eat donuts with a hot cup of coffee. Me and my dog, Lucy, like to spend time with our friends, the squirrels and lizards, in my garden"". Our kind of guy!

Jolene Thompson - Website Designer:  Lover of dogs, beer, beaches, mountains, coffee, being barefoot & not necessarily in that order! Creating truly beautiful websites that are easy to use and accessible to all. I am constantly inspired by my clients, many of whom become friends after the job is done. 

Brandon - Video Editor:  Brandon is lightning fast with his work. He amazes us. Pleasant, super flexible, willing, works hard. Like the rest of us here.",16.0,1,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Impact - what is Everything Will Be Fine In The End</h3>
<p>The film is an existential, dark comedy character piece with a great ghost story. All told through the eyes of a sweet labradoodle caught up in the conflicts of selfish people.</p>
<p>SPOILER ALERT - THE WHOLE STORY WITHOUT THE COOL CONVERSATIONS:</p>
<p>What is Everything Will Be Fine In The End about? George (Female 20s punk) has stolen a dog. She isn't even sure why. She likes the dog and took it. She is dating? this creepy guy is more than twice her age and one night the sex gets out of hand and he pushes her too far, so she hits him. He retaliates by stealing her dog - which of course is not hers anyway. She gets a day gig cleaning Julia's (this odd OCD lady) house. When she gets there, everything is wrapped in plastic. Once the lady leaves for yoga, she burglars the place. She corrals her friends Cheska and Kai, to steal more stuff from Julia but alas, Julia comes home and finds them in the house. They struggle and Julia is dead. Wrapped in plastic. Things seem fine for a minute, but soon Julia is popping up everywhere as some plastic-covered ghost, haunting them into an existential self-reflection. Chess decides to get her friends Mank and Buzz, George's now ex-bF, to help her go back to Julia's place and hide the body. But Mank has plans to do a standup routine on Hollywood and Vine as a transgender Luce Libre, so it's just her and Buzz, who has other motives for Cheska. Well, Tom, the real dog owner, has been looking all over town for his dog, and finally finds him with Mank. But as fate would have it, he is run over by accident when Buzz speeds up the road after leaving Cheska for dead at Julia's. Throughout all this, we are guided by Merlin, an urban shaman, who quotes the great poets to whoever is listening, and the ghost of Julia gets her revenge. The Hollywood ending has Merlin returning the dog to the widow of Tom.</p>

Until, one night, they discover that the power of masquerade is within them no matter where they are. </span></strong></p><p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""><i>Tabanca</i> is a short film that explores Caribbean identity and longing amidst city life in the Pacific Northwest.</span></p><p>By Writer/Director: Lauren Marsden, media artist and filmmaker of Euro-Trinidadian descent. </p><p> </p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>WHAT IS TABANCA?</b></span></p><p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">I am inspired to make this film to explore what it feels like to be in one world while your heart is in another, something I experience all the time as a Caribbean-Canadian. And that’s basically what “Tabanca” means. It’s a Trini phrase for a deep, heavy feeling of lovesickness when you long for something or someone you can’t have. I believe it’s a feeling everyone understands in their own way, especially in these times of being kept apart from that which we love. More than anything, I am really excited to tell a story that is set in the context of modern-day Vancouver life but through a Caribbean lens. This is something that we almost NEVER SEE. And with your help, I hope to change that. </span></p><p>In this story, glimpses of Carnival life seep into Marlinn’s daily life, despite being so far away. If you have ever been to Trinidad’s Carnival (aka the “Greatest Show on Earth”) then you already know what ""Carnival Tabanca"" feels like, but for those of you who don’t, just imagine all of these things together: Soca music, stilt-walkers (Moko Jumbies), all-night fetes, glitter, confetti, blazing sun, corn soup, feathers, masquerade, blue devils, wining…, you get the picture.</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>WHAT WE NEED</b></span></p><p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">To make this film, we need to raise at least $12,000 CAD.

We hope to make a film where we can express the experience of isolation and alienation while also showing the possibility of discovering joy and self-love when one least expects it.

Until, one night, they discover that the power of masquerade is within them no matter where they are. Tabanca is a short film that explores Caribbean identity and longing amidst city life in the Pacific Northwest.By Writer/Director: Lauren Marsden, media artist and filmmaker of Euro-Trinidadian descent.  WHAT IS TABANCA?I am inspired to make this film to explore what it feels like to be in one world while your heart is in another, something I experience all the time as a Caribbean-Canadian. And that’s basically what “Tabanca” means. It’s a Trini phrase for a deep, heavy feeling of lovesickness when you long for something or someone you can’t have. I believe it’s a feeling everyone understands in their own way, especially in these times of being kept apart from that which we love. More than anything, I am really excited to tell a story that is set in the context of modern-day Vancouver life but through a Caribbean lens. This is something that we almost NEVER SEE. And with your help, I hope to change that. In this story, glimpses of Carnival life seep into Marlinn’s daily life, despite being so far away. If you have ever been to Trinidad’s Carnival (aka the “Greatest Show on Earth”) then you already know what ""Carnival Tabanca"" feels like, but for those of you who don’t, just imagine all of these things together: Soca music, stilt-walkers (Moko Jumbies), all-night fetes, glitter, confetti, blazing sun, corn soup, feathers, masquerade, blue devils, wining…, you get the picture.WHAT WE NEEDTo make this film, we need to raise at least $12,000 CAD. This will help cover our basic production expenses: -honoraria for cast and crew-camera and lighting equipment rentals-location fees-food-insurance-costumes, props, hair/makeup In addition to the typical costs of a micro-budget film, we’re hosting an anti-oppression workshop for the whole production team before filming begins. It’s our priority to make our set an inclusive, trusting, and equitable space for everyone involved. WHY CONTRIBUTE?Your contribution will make all the difference. We hope to make a film where we can express the experience of isolation and alienation while also showing the possibility of discovering joy and self-love when one least expects it. And especially from a queer Caribbean perspective, a point-of-view that is still so often overlooked and underrepresented. We have started establishing an amazing and experienced team, which is continuing to grow as the film gains momentum. Here’s a glimpse of who’s already on board: LEAD ACTOR and CO-PRODUCER: Nneka CroalNneka Croal (She/They) is a queer actor, creator, and producer of Guyanese-descent based in Vancouver BC. They received their BFA from Simon Fraser University’s Theatre for the Contemporary Arts, and their MA in Arts Politics from Tisch, New York University. Nneka has been working professionally in Theatre, Film and Television for 20 years. CO-PRODUCER: Nathalie TherriaultNathalie Therriault (she/her) is an award-winning filmmaker based in Vancouver, British Columbia. Her highly acclaimed first short film, which she wrote and directed, The Tailor is currently in the festival circuit and has been shown to audiences both locally and internationally and will screen at Cannes next year. It was nominated for 5 Leo Awards, won a Spirit Award at the Chilliwack Film Festival,  Best Short Film at the LGBTQ Festival in Toronto, Best Canadian Short Film at the Oakville Festivals of Film and Arts, and most recently won Best Short Film at the San Francisco Queer Film Festival. She is currently preparing to direct her next project, Latchkey.  CINEMATOGRAPHER: Israel SeoaneIsrael Seoane has been working as a cinematographer for over a decade on narrative, commercial and documentary projects. He lived in Ethiopia for almost five years, where he learned to work in challenging environments, to make things look great with little resources and develop and endless patience. He´s been behind the camera in projects like the short film “Chigger Ale” (2012), the feature film “Crumbs” (2014) and the recently premiered feature “Jesus shows you the way to the highway” (2019), considered by some film critics and festival programmers as “The Matrix on acid”.  PRODUCTION DESIGNER: Lillian MeloBorn and raised in the wonderful city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Lillian Melo moved to Vancouver to pursue her dream of working in the film industry. Carnival and samba run in her veins as well as design and art. With a degree in Architecture and vast experience in interior design, Lillian started her career in the film industry in the biggest tv channel in South America where she worked for 3 years in set design department. Currently, she works in both the art department and set dec department in Vancouver. She was recently nominated for the Indie short fest award of Best production design for the Brazilian short film Apostasy COSTUME DESIGNER: Evan ClaytonEvan Clayton is the founder and visionary behind his self-titled label EVAN CLAYTON, a brand which marries art and design to create strong political, personal and imaginative statements in every piece of work. After graduating from Blanche MacDonald in 2011, Evan has since become an internationally known name in fashion with collections presented in Canada, Austria and Japan in addition to features in Vogue UK, Vogue China, Paper Magazine, Nylon and more. Harnessing an imagination that knows no limits, Evan has designed and executed 14 one-of-a- kind collections including The Fall of Joan (2013), Kin (2013), Jenova (2014), DEATHPROOF (2014), LILLITH (2015), LILLITH Download (2015), Worship (2015), MAHŌ SHŌJO (2016), The Devil in Miss Jones (2016), EC10 (2017), NAUSICAÄ (2018), EGO (2018), Like Hell (2019), and VILLAIN (2019). Inspired by drag and pop culture, Evan has an exaggerated take on how the modern day woman dresses which is demonstrated through his signature use of rhinestones, ostrich feather, molded leather, armor, and tulle. With designs embodying theatrical appeal, Evan has notably dressed the likes of Doja Cat, Jessie Reyez, Allie X, Brooke Candy, Kali Uchis, Cupcakke and drag queens from RuPaul’s Drag Race. PHOTOGRAPHER: Katrin BragaKatrin Braga was raised in the tiny remote town of Fellabær in East Iceland, where she took the kaleidoscopic culture and harsh natural beauty that surrounded her and began turning it into photographs. Though she now resides in the more typically beautiful Vancouver, BC, Canada, she continues to take photographs, focusing on individuals outside of the traditional norms of fashion and works on independent film projects that focus on unique storytelling. MOVEMENT COACH: Alyssa AmarshiHaving parents from Tanzania, and of Indo-Ismaili heritage, Alyssa has always been interested in diverse types of cultural expression, especially movement and intermodal art. Her passion for performing and expressing grew while she was working with Bollywood dance companies as a preteen. In high school, her friends from the West Indies exposed her to Dancehall and STEP (a form of percussive dance), both of which she continued to explore while completing her BA in Psychology at McGill University. After moving to Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish), Səl̓ílwətaʔ/Selilwitulh (Tsleil-Waututh) and xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam) lands (colonially known as Vancouver), she trained with SOULdiers Dance Company and Ketch Di Vybz where she further fortified her understanding in street dance and love of Dancehall. She has graced the stage with artists such as A Tribe Called Red, Kimmortal, and Nanya Music. She has also creative directed, choreographed and performed in pieces for Vines Festival, Indian Summer Festival, and Vancouver International Children’s Festival.  Alyssa has also sat on panels for the City of Vancouver and the Reach Gallery. Her vision, through her collective “Her Tribal Roots” is to create more opportunities for artistic expression, rooted in symbiotic collaboration, compassion, and play. WRITER/DIRECTOR: Lauren MarsdenLauren Marsden is a queer Trinidadian-Canadian filmmaker and media artist based in Vancouver, BC and situated on the unceded territory of the The xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish), səlil̓ilw̓ətaʔɬ (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations. As a storyteller, she focuses on narrative and experimental works that revolve around gender, creole identity, and the human impact on the land. With 17 years of experience as an artist under her belt, her creative work has been presented by Pacific Cinematheque, the Trinidad and Tobago Film Festival, New Media Gallery, Antimatter Film Festival, Cineworks, SFMOMA and others. She holds a Master of Fine Arts from the California College of the Arts and a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of Victoria. CONSULTING PRODUCER: Selwyn JacobSelwyn Jacob is a Canadian documentary filmmaker whose work has often explored the experiences of Black Canadians as well as other stories from Canada's multicultural communities, both as an independent director and since 1997 as a producer with the National Film Board of Canada (NFB).Originally from Trinidad, Jacob attended a teacher's college there before traveling to Canada in 1968 to complete a Bachelor of Education at the University of Alberta in Edmonton.

<ul><li>Hi everyone, thank you for checking out the Indigogo for ""Half Dead Fred"".</li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul><li>My name is Bron Theron. I am the writer and director of this feature film. The story is a cross between China Town and The Sixth Sense. It stars  Corin Nemec as our Medium detective who travels to Flint to solve a murder case. I am working with two producers from Flint; Joe Schipani and Jessica Revoldt. They are helping this project stay true to a Flint Film. I have raised the initial funds for this movie already but wanted  to do an indigogo to get a little extra money for the main talent. I have backed  several projects myself because I want independent film to thrive. Normally I produce low budget projects, but I have been involved with large productions as well and I know how important each of these positions are in film making. Being a backer myself,  I know how important honoring the perks are. I have been on both sides of the camera and I know the most important thing in film making is positive energy, This is a truly unorthodox business and there is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" way to make a movie but there is a positive and a negative work flow and I am building my team to create a good story that stands the test of time,  and to have fun while doing it. This is my 4th feature film. Please feel free to check out my imdb for my other  projects. This film is very important to me because of the support in the community of Flint, the story that I love,  and the amount of time and money I will be investing.  Another reason why this film is so dear to my heart is I have Corin Nemec attached to it. I am a big fan and had a great time working with him on the series ""The Heat Of The Beat"". I also have director of photography, Zackery  Malloy from that project and the director,  Jordan C. Michael working on Half Dead Fred. </li></ul>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>I am excited to shoot in Flint Michigan. I have been going to Flint  since 2017 doing murals with Flint Public Art Project. I have met some great people and the community is overflowing with creativity.  After reading Haunted Flint,  I thought we should shoot a movie there. The architecture is great for this type of film and I want as many people from Flint in the movie as possible.</li>
<li>This campaign will help this film in many ways. When films are being made it is good to know there is an audience waiting to see them. We have a good story here and a good story deserves an audience. I look at this campaign as marketing. I also look at it as a way that people can get involved. We auditioned lots of locals and not everyone can star in a movie but there are options to be a part of it in other ways.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What we need</h3>
<ul>
<li>The campaign funds are for three main reasons: Main talent, transportation and to fill some acting roles that haven’t been cast. </li>
<li>We have some amazing perks for our backers. You can be in this film as a role or a ghost! You can be drawn as a ghost in front of our famous location in Carriage Town or at the graveyard where we have an exciting scene planned out. We also have little perks that you can get like shirts and stickers! Every little bit helps,  even a few bucks can keep our campaign trending on the platform so no amount is too little.</li>
<li>I am 100 percent sure we will reach our goals and even push it to stretch goals. The films funding is already in place. The goals that will be ahead of us are marketing, film festivals, and  post production costs. It will also cost to screen in movie theaters with premieres in Flint and in Los Angeles. It is very expensive making a good movie and that is what we are doing.At this point our budget is very low to make this happen so it will help to get a positive campaign going. We are building a team, The next movie I have planned is going to probably have most of the same people. The team is the dream! </li>

<p><b>FOUR MONOLOGUES TO CHOOSE FROM:</b></p>
<p>PAUL HOLT</p>
<p>I don't want to scare anyone, but I'm going to give it to you straight about Jason. His body was never recovered from the lake after he drowned. And if you listen to the old timers in town, they'll tell you he's still out there...some sort of demented creature, surviving in the wilderness, full grown by now. Stalking...stealing what he needs, living off wild animals and vegetation. Some folks claim they've even seen him...right in this area. The girl who survived that night at Camp Blood, that Friday the 13th, she claimed she saw him. She disappeared two months later. Vanished. Blood was everywhere. No one knows what happened to her. Legend has it that Jason saw his mother beheaded that night...and he took his revenge. A revenge that he'll continue to seek if anyone ever enters his wilderness again. And by now, I guess you all know, we're the first to return here. Five years...five long years he's been dormant...and he's hungry. Jason's out there...watching...always on the prowl for intruders. Waiting to kill...waiting to devour. Thirsty for young blood. </p>
<p>PAMELA VOORHEES</p>
<p>Oh god, this place! (throws hands against wall) Steve should never have opened this place again. There's been too much trouble here.  Did you know a young boy drowned the year before those two others were killed? The counselors weren't paying any attention... They were making love while that young boy drowned. His name was Jason. I was working the day that it happened. Preparing meals... here. I was the cook. Jason should've been watched. Every minute. He was... he wasn't a very good swimmer. We can go now, dear. It'll be easier for you than it was for Jason.</p>
<p>MARCIE CUNNINGHAM</p>
<p>Yeah I had this dream about five or six times when I'm in a thunderstorm. And it's raining really hard, it sounds like pebbles when it hits the ground. I can hear it! I try to block out the sound with my hands only it doesn't work, the sound keeps getting louder and louder. And then the rain turns to blood, and it washes away in little rivers, and then the sound stops.  I call it my shower dream.</p>
<p>MAYOR COBB</p>
<p>I don't care if you have to put your fucking mother behind bars! Get me the goddamn psycho who's responsible for this mess!! Holy shit, Tucker, What the hell's going on here?! I'm mean, this is a small town, man, and small towns are supposed to be safe!  Jason Voorhees? You're out of your fucking mind. You've been out in the sun too long. Jason Voorhees is dead! His body was cremated. He's nothing but a handful of ash.  Jason Voorhees?  I can't believe this! Here. This is your ""Jason Voorhees"" here. This!  Your ass is on the line here, Tucker. Are you getting that? You get me a goddamn live suspect!</p>

FOUR MONOLOGUES TO CHOOSE FROM:
PAUL HOLT
I don't want to scare anyone, but I'm going to give it to you straight about Jason. His body was never recovered from the lake after he drowned. And if you listen to the old timers in town, they'll tell you he's still out there...some sort of demented creature, surviving in the wilderness, full grown by now. Stalking...stealing what he needs, living off wild animals and vegetation. Some folks claim they've even seen him...right in this area. The girl who survived that night at Camp Blood, that Friday the 13th, she claimed she saw him. She disappeared two months later. Vanished. Blood was everywhere. No one knows what happened to her. Legend has it that Jason saw his mother beheaded that night...and he took his revenge. A revenge that he'll continue to seek if anyone ever enters his wilderness again. And by now, I guess you all know, we're the first to return here. Five years...five long years he's been dormant...and he's hungry. Jason's out there...watching...always on the prowl for intruders. Waiting to kill...waiting to devour. Thirsty for young blood. 
PAMELA VOORHEES
Oh god, this place! (throws hands against wall) Steve should never have opened this place again. There's been too much trouble here.  Did you know a young boy drowned the year before those two others were killed? The counselors weren't paying any attention... They were making love while that young boy drowned. His name was Jason. I was working the day that it happened. Preparing meals... here. I was the cook. Jason should've been watched. Every minute. He was... he wasn't a very good swimmer. We can go now, dear. It'll be easier for you than it was for Jason.
MARCIE CUNNINGHAM
Yeah I had this dream about five or six times when I'm in a thunderstorm. And it's raining really hard, it sounds like pebbles when it hits the ground. I can hear it! I try to block out the sound with my hands only it doesn't work, the sound keeps getting louder and louder. And then the rain turns to blood, and it washes away in little rivers, and then the sound stops.  I call it my shower dream.
MAYOR COBB
I don't care if you have to put your fucking mother behind bars! Get me the goddamn psycho who's responsible for this mess!! Holy shit, Tucker, What the hell's going on here?! I'm mean, this is a small town, man, and small towns are supposed to be safe!  Jason Voorhees? You're out of your fucking mind. You've been out in the sun too long. Jason Voorhees is dead! His body was cremated. He's nothing but a handful of ash.  Jason Voorhees?  I can't believe this! Here. This is your ""Jason Voorhees"" here. This!  Your ass is on the line here, Tucker. Are you getting that? You get me a goddamn live suspect!",11.0,0,"7 Campaigns

<p>Hoping you are doing as best as possible during this unprecedented time and it's nice to e-meet you all! My name is Tasha Hardy and I'm a writer and a producer. Even though I'm not a fan of country music and scorching hot weather, I somehow love living in Austin, Texas.</p>

<h3>Story</h3>
<p>CURIOSITY is an award-winning, quirky dramedy about a bored, small town mailman, Bob Cooke, who has a not-so-secret double life of spying on people and impulsively getting into their business. When he witnesses the girl of his dreams being kidnapped, it sends him into a hyper stealth mode, working alongside his younger, skeptical friend Dustin – a detective wannabe. </p>
<h3>A note from the filmmaker (Why am I doing this?!)</h3>
<p>Part I:</p>
<p>Nobody normally wakes up one day and says ""I think I'll spend 5000 hours over the next six months writing, fundraising for and making a short film."" But during the pandemic, this happened to me.  Let me back up a bit. The night before I had binge watched ""The Good Place"" and woke up feeling hopeful, despite not leaving the house for two weeks and having had developed a crippling fear of doorknobs.</p>
<p>I thought about a tv pilot script I had written a couple of years back that had a similar tone and message and I thought ""Curiosity would make people feel happy when they watch it."" From that point on I become obsessed with pulling a short out of the pilot script to shoot. (This will also be used as a presentation piece for the television series.)</p>
<p>Part II:</p>
<p>As mentioned in the video, when I was younger I felt invisible. I was shy and had a hard time fitting in. Anxious to make friends, I started really listening to what was going on around me, which sometimes included people's private conversations/stuff I wasn't supposed to know. I became the ""town gossip"" and ""snoop"" wherever I went. I knew everything about everyone and people came to me for information. It made me feel connected and useful.</p>
<p>What I gleaned from this experience of myself is that I think all of us deep down inside want to make a positive difference; it just kind of comes out in weird ways sometimes. This is the theme of this film.</p>

<p><i> - Me circa 1981 after snooping in all of the Christmas presents and taping them back together</i></p>
<p>Also this is a very diverse project, with positive commentary and undertones of racial inclusion and understanding. I feel it supports some of the social challenges currently going on in the world.</p>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>Making a movie is no cheap deal. In fact when I look at my budget my vision goes blurry. That's the bad news. The good news is my team and I know how to make movies and have a track record to prove it, we just need the funding and that's where you come in.</p>
<p>We have an initial goal of $20k as well as some stretch goals that I will explain after I share with you this beautiful pie chart I made to show you just where your money will be going. (It took me a really long time so please take it in.) </p>
<p>If we make close to the goal but not the entire goal, the money will filter into the same percentages we would just need to slim the budget down in certain areas. Examples: Find a less expensive location. Tasha doesn't eat during production. (No problem.)</p>

<p>The funded money will pay the costs of transportation, locations, permissions, insurances, catering, equipment, set decoration, costumes, make-up, sound editing and mixing, color grading and distribution.

BC-based industry leaders in each of these areas will be interviewed and will share their journey, their initiatives in addressing food waste, and their solutions and challenges towards sustainable practices. Farmers will learn from retailers, consumers will learn from restaurants, manufacturers will learn from distributors. Our world is craving solutions. Our world needs hope. This is why Food Synergy is important.</p>

6. Contribution breakdown
We want to ensure being transparent not just by traceability of organizations involved, but also by sharing our cost distribution in the project. We are focusing on production costs, and 5% of the fundraiser will go to local non-profits fighting food waste: Vancouver Food Runners and Second Harvest.


7. What if we exceed our goal?

If we exceed our goal, we will:
- Work with a larger team of skilled animators
- Onboard more local artists for music, dance and colour correction
- Apply to international film festivals
- Organize educational campaigns
 

8. Risks & Challenges

Trust is really important to us, and we want to share nothing but the truth with you!
Timing and delays 
In our daily lives, our team members are all very punctual. Our expectations are really high for doing things in a timely manner. Like any project, there is a risk that timelines fall apart a lot. In this case, we will have an open communication with our backers.
Team
We have a strong team extremely motivated by the project. However, we are always at risk of losing a team member along the way. This has the potential to result in delays to fulfilment. In this case, and this impacting our ability to fulfill your pledge, we will reach out to our backers with an email including anticipated timeline.  
COVID-19
The pandemic may affect the timeline of the production. However, most of our interviewees have been secured and we are confident in being able to follow safety guidelines. Our team has been working in the creative industry during those challenging times and is uniquely positioned to overcome this challenge.
We will do our best to minimize those risks and communicate with you!",15.0,1,"1 Campaign

By contributing, you not only help us lay the important creative groundwork for the film, but you also demonstrate to Hollywood that a film about LGBTQ+ characters is worth producing, and that there is an audience for great LGBTQ+ content. That gets noticed. By raising $50,000, we will be able to kick off pre-production of this animated feature film. 
$5,000: For additional character design.
$10,000: For world building and background design.
$20,000: For initial storyboarding.
$10,000: For original music for two lip sync numbers and a lip sync duel finale.
$5,000: For insurance and legal services.
WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDSWhen Can I See Maxxie?!?Maxxie LaWow will be animated in the 2D style. This process takes time as most frames are manually drawn by artists and is expensive. It's also beautiful! Our current timeline will make Maxxie LaWow available for film festivals starting in January 2024, and theatrical distribution around Summer/Fall 2024. Donate to this campaign, and you’ll receive regular updates on timing, sneak previews, and more! What’s Next After this Movie?We are creating a fun, fashionable, and campy world for Maxxie LaWow and her friends. Getting picked up by any streaming service or network is hard under the best of circumstances, and harder for an LGBTQ+ story. But with your help and overwhelming support from the community, we know we can bring Maxxie back for more! You saw the adventure reel above. You will definitely want to know what’s going on with the characters from future storylines:  that were-unicorn, the DJ Demon, and the biker faerie gang. Please donate generously and tell your friends!THE CASTWe are currently casting the lead actors and expect to make announcements soon… The voiceover cast are expected to be fabulous up-and-coming talent from the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, New York, and beyond.

<p>THE SHORT FILM...</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">""...essentially Big Brother meets Death Race but with zombies instead of cars.""</h3>

<h3>WHAT'S THE SHORT ABOUT?</h3>
<p>DOUGLAS SIKES, a convicted war criminal from the American Zombie War, runs a black-market trading ring from the bowels of a walled-in quarantine zone turned for-profit prison. He and the other prisoners live under the watchful eye of the ZTV broadcasting company, and at the whim of THE PREZERVE, a capital punishment reality game show that uses zombies, and horrific devices, to torture, infect, and execute prisoners and their families on prime time network television. PAUL, and his daughter, LILY, arrive at Doug’s home to find him grief-stricken and consumed with rage after his daughter Steffie’s gruesome episode has broadcast her terrible fate for all the world to see. Paul and Lily find themselves in the cross-fire as Doug readies to unleash bloody vengeance on the institution and the vengeful woman who has oppressed him.</p>

<p>Because there is far too much story in Jason's head, he has already written volumes of material which expands the ZTV universe in several directions. We were only able to give a small taste of that world in the short film, but the comic, free from the budgetary constraints of filmmaking, will be used to explore the massive potential of the universe as well as exploring small quiet struggles of far-flung characters in their most solitary and desperate moments...</p>

<p>Over the course of the campaign, our writer, director JASON RAGOSTA will be posting WIP art of the thumbnailing, Layout, Inking, and Colorwork on ISSUE ZERO of the COMIC BOOK, which will tell the ORIGIN STORY of PREZERVE host, BRAD MANNINGS and the horrifying events that lead him to become the figurehead of filling ZED-FREE AMERICA'S need for Old Testament justice.</p>

<p>We have actually been sitting on a feature-length ZTV script for over a year, and are ready and able to dive into a full feature film to expand the ZTV Universe...</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Every dollar counts! And we need those dollars desperately.... But we're not doing this campaign just for the money. We're doing it to connect with people that love all the crazy horror stuff that we love. If this campaign is truly successful, it will mean that you guys will be discussing what cool new films are coming out on SHUDDER, or about to come to virtual blows over whether MANDY is a better film than HEREDITARY or who's gonna win in each category in this years FANGORIA AWARDS. (We're die-hard MANDY, change our minds!)</p>
<p>Please consider this campaign (and the whole ZTV Universe for that matter) as a bonfire we have lit to serve as a beacon for HORROR FANS all over the world to come together and enjoy. So please, engage us! Because we firmly believe that the love of horror is one of the purest forms of love, which is why Horror fans kind of own the internet as the most dedicated and rabid of all the fans. </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have built this project to scale to whatever amount of money we end up with. We will finish it no matter what. Only, without having enough cash, it will take a lot longer to finish and will end up with a smaller and less developed film than we know ZTV Sympathy for the Devil can be. </p>
<p>With your help, we can reach our goal! </p>
<p><strong>YOU </strong>have the power to make it possible for ZTV to reach its full potential,</p>
<p><strong>YOU</strong> can give us a fighting chance to stand out among the crowded field of short films that are made every year.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p><strong>If you can't donate cash, it's ok!  </strong></p>
<p>If you dig the crazy universe that we're building, and you know other people who might dig it, <strong>PLEASE</strong> spread the word about the campaign by <strong>FOLLOWING</strong> us on <strong>FACEBOOK</strong>, <strong>INSTAGRAM</strong>, and/or <strong>TWITTER</strong>. Sharing the link to the campaign is a massive help to us and we appreciate every single <strong>SHARE</strong>, <strong>LIKE</strong>, and <strong>FOLLOW</strong>. </p>
<p>We also invite you to come back and check out the campaign often, as it will evolve and have a constant stream of WIP Comic Book art, new video content, and insane new rewards as we make our way (HOPEFULLY) to our goal. </p>
<p>In the end, we appreciate you actually scrolling through all of our content to read this!</p>
<p><strong>THANK YOU SO MUCH</strong> for sticking with us!!</p>
<p>You are hella-thorough! You made it all the way to the end!</p>
<p>For now.</p>
<p>Be sure to keep the channel locked right here...</p>
<p>Only on ZTV.</p>

THE SHORT FILM...
""...essentially Big Brother meets Death Race but with zombies instead of cars.""
 - Jonathan Barkan, DREAD CENTRAL

 
WHAT'S THE SHORT ABOUT?
DOUGLAS SIKES, a convicted war criminal from the American Zombie War, runs a black-market trading ring from the bowels of a walled-in quarantine zone turned for-profit prison. He and the other prisoners live under the watchful eye of the ZTV broadcasting company, and at the whim of THE PREZERVE, a capital punishment reality game show that uses zombies, and horrific devices, to torture, infect, and execute prisoners and their families on prime time network television. PAUL, and his daughter, LILY, arrive at Doug’s home to find him grief-stricken and consumed with rage after his daughter Steffie’s gruesome episode has broadcast her terrible fate for all the world to see. Paul and Lily find themselves in the cross-fire as Doug readies to unleash bloody vengeance on the institution and the vengeful woman who has oppressed him.
HERE'S A CLIP FROM THE FILM!

ZTV: UNDEAD EMPIRE • COMIC BOOK
A UNIVERSE EXPANDED...


Because there is far too much story in Jason's head, he has already written volumes of material which expands the ZTV universe in several directions. We were only able to give a small taste of that world in the short film, but the comic, free from the budgetary constraints of filmmaking, will be used to explore the massive potential of the universe as well as exploring small quiet struggles of far-flung characters in their most solitary and desperate moments...

Over the course of the campaign, our writer, director JASON RAGOSTA will be posting WIP art of the thumbnailing, Layout, Inking, and Colorwork on ISSUE ZERO of the COMIC BOOK, which will tell the ORIGIN STORY of PREZERVE host, BRAD MANNINGS and the horrifying events that lead him to become the figurehead of filling ZED-FREE AMERICA'S need for Old Testament justice.

IN-UNIVERSE COMMERCIAL

ULTIMATE STRETCH GOAL UNLOCK: $500K
ZTV THE FEATURE FILM 
If we hella-over-perform with our stretch goals, we will make a ZTV feature film! 

We have actually been sitting on a feature-length ZTV script for over a year, and are ready and able to dive into a full feature film to expand the ZTV Universe...

 
The Impact
Every dollar counts! And we need those dollars desperately.... But we're not doing this campaign just for the money. We're doing it to connect with people that love all the crazy horror stuff that we love. If this campaign is truly successful, it will mean that you guys will be discussing what cool new films are coming out on SHUDDER, or about to come to virtual blows over whether MANDY is a better film than HEREDITARY or who's gonna win in each category in this years FANGORIA AWARDS. (We're die-hard MANDY, change our minds!)
Please consider this campaign (and the whole ZTV Universe for that matter) as a bonfire we have lit to serve as a beacon for HORROR FANS all over the world to come together and enjoy. So please, engage us! Because we firmly believe that the love of horror is one of the purest forms of love, which is why Horror fans kind of own the internet as the most dedicated and rabid of all the fans. 
 

Risks & Challenges
We have built this project to scale to whatever amount of money we end up with. We will finish it no matter what. Only, without having enough cash, it will take a lot longer to finish and will end up with a smaller and less developed film than we know ZTV Sympathy for the Devil can be. 
With your help, we can reach our goal! 
YOU have the power to make it possible for ZTV to reach its full potential,
YOU can give us a fighting chance to stand out among the crowded field of short films that are made every year.

Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't donate cash, it's ok!  
If you dig the crazy universe that we're building, and you know other people who might dig it, PLEASE spread the word about the campaign by FOLLOWING us on FACEBOOK, INSTAGRAM, and/or TWITTER. Sharing the link to the campaign is a massive help to us and we appreciate every single SHARE, LIKE, and FOLLOW. 
We also invite you to come back and check out the campaign often, as it will evolve and have a constant stream of WIP Comic Book art, new video content, and insane new rewards as we make our way (HOPEFULLY) to our goal. 
In the end, we appreciate you actually scrolling through all of our content to read this!
THANK YOU SO MUCH for sticking with us!!
You are hella-thorough! You made it all the way to the end!
For now.
Be sure to keep the channel locked right here...

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>It's a hot summer day and Joie Jones is in desperate need of a new hairdo. To fix this, she visits her local place of worship: the beauty supply store. Here, she finds solace in knowing she will walk out with all the products she needs to look and feel better. Then her mother calls. ""Stop by the store for me on your way home, please?"" She asks. How will a self-conscious and overthinking Joie deal with the impending feeling of shame as she faces walking out of her safe haven and into public with a hair bonnet?

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>We all know what it's like to feel like we don't belong. In Spring 2021, our team launched LUNAR: The Jewish-Asian Film Project with the belief that if Asian American Jews see ourselves on camera, we can start to feel understood and find community. We gathered 23 Asian American Jews to discuss their experiences, and put the results into a video series on social media. We got real about fusion food, cultural trauma, discovering our identities, and the impacts of racism and antisemitism on our lives. These authentic and compelling videos made big waves in our communities - people watched our videos over 35,000 times; we were selected for 2 major film festivals and featured in dozens of press outlets, including MTV News. You can view our first season in the video highlight reel above.</p>
<p>Now we're back with a second season, because we still have so much to tell the world about who we are. In the second season, watch Asian American Jews dive deep into our experiences with media representation, religion, language, and so much more! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Due to generous support from foundations, season 2 is partly funded. We just need a little more help to make the videos the best they can be! Your contribution will support:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our ability to compensate our stellar team of Asian American Jewish creatives at equitable rates</li>
<li>Necessary tech equipment and software to improve the quality of our content</li>
</ul>
<p>For your contribution, you'll receive some exciting perks, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shout-outs on our credits and social media</li>
<li>Personalized thank-you cards from our team</li>
<li>LUNAR branded stickers</li>
<li>LUNAR branded T-Shirts</li>
<li>Meet n Greet with our all-star team</li>
<li>Private Season 2 Preview Party with our team and select cast members</li>
<li>A chance to win an original Chinese &amp; Jewish cultural fusion art piece from our amazing Art Director, Davi Cheng</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>LUNAR has resonated with people across the world. For the first time, Asian American Jews felt like we belonged. Through these videos, we felt seen as our full selves. We told our stories on our own terms. We found our way home to each other.</p>
<p>Belonging in such an isolated world is so important. Especially with the rise in anti-Asian hate and antisemitism this year, LUNAR videos have been a source of affirmation and empowerment for us. As folks with marginalized identities, having a place to go where our full selves are shown with pride and joy is crucial. </p>
<p>We need your help to keep our videos going, so that more and more people can find themselves in our stories. More and more folks can know that they matter, they belong, and they are enough.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>STORY</strong></p>
<p>They say that if you want to be successful, you should invest your time in something that makes you want to get up in the morning.  For directors, this is the craft of storytelling and film is our medium.  Blake was one of the first indie filmmakers in recent history to experiment with small format anamorphics.  This method of getting the larger than life, wide-screen canvas and a softness which ensures that viewing experience that can only be described as truly cinematic.  <i>The Land</i> was shot and edited on film, in CinemaScope.</p>
<p><i><u>The Injustice of Justice:</u>  </i>The filmmaker's connection to this theme has always been an intuitive one.  So much so that the first draft of <i>The Land</i> was written in only two days.  A 2020 premier is timely as the public is becoming more aware of this widespread social problem with the release of other films and TV shows that explore the issue.  In America, are we truly free?</p>

</div><div>
<p>The film has been edited and now we need finishing services that amount to just under $10,000.  That covers ""Necessary"" Expenses.  Additional expenses are shown below that.</p>
<p><u><strong>NECESSARY EXPENSES</strong></u></p>
<p><u>OCN LAB SERVICES (Roughly 40% of the budget))</u></p>
<p>One of our major obstacles to finishing this film is that there was no way to edit Cinema Grade digital footage until 2015 (without mortgaging your house).  At that point in time, digital cinema equipment started to filter its way down to indie producers.  That's great news but our O.C.N (Original Camera Negative) is film originated.  In order to take advantage of the new technology, we still need a digital scan to convert the 16mm Cinemascope negative to a DI (<u>D</u>igital <u>I</u>ntermediate.)  The DI will be in the 2k, 10 bit, DCI standard (the same standard as major motion pictures.)  This will be done at a premier film lab in Los Angeles, CA using the same equipment and workflow that Quentin Tarantino used for his latest project.  </p>
<p><strong>Blog Post</strong>: <a href=""https://wp.me/p2EYtp-rC"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">What are OCN Lab Services Exactly</a></p>
<p><u>COLOR CORRECTION (Roughly 50% of the budget)</u></p>
<p>Film color work is extremely complex compared to traditional video color grading.  This work will be handled by the pros at Fotokem labs in Los Angeles, CA.  Our DI colorist George Koran has worked with the likes of Stephen Spielberg and David Lynch on 4k restorations of some of their prior movies that were originally shot and finished in the film medium.  He also works on new footage originated in the digital cinema 4k format and finished digitally to meet the high standards required for deilvery to major broadcast networks and streaming service providers.</p>
<p><u>LAB EXPENSES - MISCELLANEOUS  (Roughly 10% of the budget)</u></p>
<p>These expenses cover small items like hard drives needed to send files back and forth between Texas and California, freight charges, a telecine scan from The Post Group, and travel expenses for one trip to California that is needed for the final supervised color pas at Fotokem.</p>
<p><strong><u>STRETCH GOALS </u></strong></p>
<p><u>SOUND FINISHING (Roughly 10% of the budget)</u></p>
<p>Additionally, money will go to Joe and Isaac, the sound team for sound editing, mixing and score composition and recording.  The team is all from Austin, TX, the live music capitol of the world where we have some of the best musical talent, the world over.</p>
<p><u>CAMPAIGN EXPENSES / DIGITAL DUSTBUSTING / VFX WORK / CAMPAIGN EDITING</u></p>
<p>With the introduction of low cost Ultra HD tools over the last two years, the remaining finishing work can be done in-house in Austin, TX which will save tens of thousands of dollars.  However, VFX is very time consuming and we'll need to take time of from our regular jobs to do the work.  Between the extensive time commitment needed for running the campaign and managing the post-production process, the financial sacrifice becomes a noticeable strain on myself and Cindy our marketing manager.  Some money will go towards living expenses during this intense post work period for us both.   Our head editor will also get a modest stipend.</p>
<p><u>LIVE ORCHESTRAL RECORDING ( $1,000) &amp; HDR COLOR PASS ($TBD)  </u></p>
<p><u>ORGANIC music to compliment the organic film:  </u>Isaac, our composer is also an experienced conductor and recording studio engineer.  If we can manage the funding, we'll work with him and his orchestra musicians to add a human touch to the score which up till now has all been done using synthesizers and digital sampling.  While the digital gear sounds very good, the human touch of a live musician and acoustic texture of real instruments will dovetail perfectly with the organic experience created by the film medium and anamorphic optical elements used in production.</p>
<p><u>HDR lowers our Risk:  </u>Since our production was planned in the old Cinema tradition that puts visual art at the top of a long list of production concerns, we have the foundation to take advantage of next generation television standards that will give a more cinematic experience for those who choose to view the film at home in their living room or on a capable mobile device.  This new standard is called High Dynamic Range (HDR.)   HDR is a resolution, bit depth and color space combination that approximates the look that you would traditionally only get in the theater.  Fotokem will soon provide pricing for a color pass and mastering to the latest HDR standard.  The advantages to the viewer is obvious but also from a business perspective, this is an advantage because offering an HDR version for sale will give us a competitive advantage (most films selling on the web these days use the decades old TV specifications.)  </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WHAT YOU GET</strong></p>
<p>Contributors will receive perks that are unique to a film originated project like ours.  In addition to a digital download of the film, various packages will include autographed copies of production records, producers materials, actual 16mm film strips that were saved from the cutting room floor, AMA hangouts (Ask Me Anything) with the director/producer/editor, autographed festival handbills, props, your name in the credits and one lucky beverage company will win the right, as sole sponsor to have their logo inserted digitally throughout the film.</p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WHAT HAVE WE INVESTED?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I've spent around $25,000 of my own money to get the film shot and edited. </li>
<li>I've invested an additional $10,000 in post-production equipment needed to handle the coordination with LA and to do the VFX work (and for VFX work...fortunately, this is setup that can be used on future films.) </li>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>WHY IT MATTERS</strong></p>
<p>This project is one of just a few programs to address the issue of corruption in the justice system as it relates to middle class society.  It also addresses the fear mongering and vilification of people without due process of law.  While this theme is nothing unique, our perspective is.  A fresh take on the problem will add to those existing voices that have made their way to the public through music, TV and film.</p>
<p>The Intensive Production Sequence was an exclusive program at the University of Texas at Austin.  Out of 120 applicants, I was one of 8 granted consent to enter the thesis class as a writer/director.  <i>The Land</i> was my submission for consent.  For myself and my film tribe, those years in film school was one of our most productive periods and we made lots of progress.  Now It's time to build on that track record.  Finishing this film is the last step towards launching a career, a journey that we started many years ago.  So much has been invested in the craft and we've come so far.  We don't plan to stop now!</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>They say that only 3 out of every 10 films are successful at the box office.  Our production crew's professionalism and enthusiasm for storytelling has already worked to overcome these risks in the production phase, which is now in the rear view mirror.  We're 90% done and charging ahead on the last mile of the marathon!  This is great news and the icing on the cake is that our theme has become more popular in the media than when we started out, with shows like ""Making a Murderer"" and ""The Central Park Five.""  This means that there is a growing market for our story.</p>
<p>The post-production phase presents additional challenges which have been overcome by traveling to Los Angeles to work closely with the film lab on scan tests and color correction tests.  The results have come back and some of the images have been posted to Reddit.com cinematography community with overwhelmingly positive results.</p>
<p>Marketing and Distribution present the final challenge.  The M&amp;D plan is in development and will provide the road map needed to get our film into festivals where the real networking happens.  A seasoned M&amp;D producer will be hired to advise on the most efficient/effective plan.</p>
<p>Promotion is as important as the production itself.  Our team is young and culture savvy.  Most of us have been in the workforce for 10 to 15 years and have experience with sales, communications messaging, advertising, and/or public relations.</p>

They say that if you want to be successful, you should invest your time in something that makes you want to get up in the morning.  For directors, this is the craft of storytelling and film is our medium.  Blake was one of the first indie filmmakers in recent history to experiment with small format anamorphics.  This method of getting the larger than life, wide-screen canvas and a softness which ensures that viewing experience that can only be described as truly cinematic.  The Land was shot and edited on film, in CinemaScope.
The Injustice of Justice:  The filmmaker's connection to this theme has always been an intuitive one.  So much so that the first draft of The Land was written in only two days.  A 2020 premier is timely as the public is becoming more aware of this widespread social problem with the release of other films and TV shows that explore the issue.  In America, are we truly free?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Be a part of Bigfoot Research History!</p>
<p>The Chronicles of Carlos team is ready to launch the most promising Bigfoot expedition in recent memory and this is your opportunity to be a part of this groundbreaking project.</p>
<p>After years of research and interviews, we have identified what we believe to be one of the most favorable locations ever identified in cryptozoology-- one that has produced consistent encounters with an unknown hominid species for well over two decades in a remote, inaccessible, and unexplored location-- one county away from where the most famous Bigfoot video, the Paterson-Gimlin film, was shot. </p>
<p>We will travel with Kirk Stewart-- an eyewitness with multiple direct encounters with these creatures spanning many years-- to this Northern California location to learn more about his encounters and see firsthand where they occurred. With the benefit of his years of experience with the local creatures and the expertise of the Chronicles of Carlos team, we hope to return with unprecedented proof of the existence of Sasquatch!</p>
<p>ABOUT US</p>
<p>In the mid-1990s, I was a graduate student and Teaching Assistant at Washington State University studying under and working for Dr. Grover Krantz, who taught me the investigative methods he used and showed me the scientific proof that supported his seminal work “Big Footprints: A Scientific Inquiry into the Reality of Sasquatch.” Over a quarter-century later, I am bringing my mentor’s lifelong expertise in Bigfoot research and combining it with my own experiences and investigative techniques (involving modern technology unavailable to Dr. Krantz) to bear on this expedition, which is an unprecedented opportunity to solve the Sasquatch mystery that has eluded researchers for so long.</p>
<p>For the Chronicles of Carlos, I investigate, create, and share mainstream educational content, extraordinary Bigfoot encounters and other mysteries, mythologies, and legends of the unknown, and examine and discuss the scientific methods and principles corroborating our stories. My platforms are for a very large audience of those curious about Bigfoot as well as the Bigfoot knowers, believers, and skeptics. My goal is to share knowledge, stories, evidence, etc., and for my audience to share their ideas, thoughts, and encounter stories with all of us.</p>
<p>My hope and intent are for these platforms to bring people from all parts of the audience spectrum around the world together to grow in our knowledge and understanding of Bigfoot and other cryptic hominoids and anthropomorphic creatures. I have done (and am available for) speaking engagements, podcasts, interviews, guided excursions, investigations, and all varieties of content creation related to my areas of expertise. I never tire of teaching, sharing, and learning when it comes to Nature’s mysteries!</p>
<p>My educational background is in the Sciences. I earned a B.A. in Anthropology at Pomona College under Dr. James McKenna, and I finished the Masters/Ph.D. program that I started at Washington State University under Dr. Grover Krantz with an M.A. in Anthropology at the University of Wyoming under Dr. George Gill. My graduation project at Pomona-– where I also founded the Cryptozoology Club and was a member of the International Society of Cryptozoology, was on the existence of Bigfoot. At Wazzu, my unpublished thesis was about Gigantopithecines (very large, fossilized Asian apes that lived around 2.6 million years ago until very recent times) and their hypothetical, ancestral connection to Bigfoot. During my time at Wazzu, I was involved in giving Bigfoot presentations at the university and also at Sasquatch Days in Harrison Hot Springs, British Columbia, Canada.</p>
<p>My career background has mostly been as an entrepreneur, leader, teacher, and coach. I have worked as an Anthropology (Biological, Archeological, Cultural, and Linguistic) teaching assistant at the university level and as a middle and high school STEM/ STEAM teacher (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics). I have coached Olympic and collegiate swimmers and divers all the way down to high school and middle school athletics teams. I have loved instructing athletes of all levels-- from beginners to the elite. One notable entrepreneurial venture was a retail and social business called “Bigfoot’s Lair” where I hosted gaming leagues, a trading market, and tournaments for collectible trading card games and video games.</p>
<p>For this campaign, I look forward to re-introducing myself and the Chronicles of Carlos brand to the world audience and to telling the stories of Kirk Stewart whose many encounters with Sasquatch over his lifetime living off-the-grid in the Pacific Northwest are captivating as well as compelling. Several of Kirk’s encounters were written about in David Paulides’ book, “ Tribal Bigfoot.” Kirk has encountered these beings playing, found their footprints, hair, and wooden structures, heard their cries and listened to them communicate in their jibber-jabber language, smelled them, and even had one bluff charge him and two hunting companions-- it ran right over the top of him! For this campaign, Kirk has agreed to take us up to the even more remote area where something left all of his provisions but took his gun, moved it some distance away, and buried it! </p>
<p>This campaign is extremely important to me as I have wanted to create a documentary to discuss the details and share the evidence of my encounters for years now. Over my lifetime I have met many people who have had similar encounters to-- and some quite different from-- my own, and I am excited to tell their stories, too. I hadn’t considered hosting a docu-series before meeting my Director, Chris Narrie, but now I am convinced that this is a much better way to not only share my own Sasquatch encounter stories but also to share the encounters of others that I have met along my lifelong journey into learning more about the Sasquatch people. Your contributions will make this dream a reality and help to give me the means to be in a position, with the help of others like myself, to create video and audio content that pushes the thoughtful conversation forward and helps to disclose one of the greatest mysteries of all time: the reality of our co-existence with the Sasquatch people of the world-- which many still do not know or even believe exist. The magnitude of this disclosure is immeasurable in terms of its impact on modern society and civilization. You can be a part of this paradigm-shifting disclosure!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We are hoping to collect video and audio evidence of Sasquatch.  Most of our budget is going towards equipment in order to give us the best chance of obtaining definitive proof. </p>
<p>$2000 for a professional thermal camera so that we can capture evidence at night.</p>
<p>$250 for a parabolic microphone to capture vocalization.</p>
<p>$120 for a lens that will allow us to capture images from far away.</p>
<p>$1250 for other film equipment, tripod, lights, batteries, etc.</p>
<p>$1380 to cover all other costs, travel, food, basic post-production, etc.*</p>
<p>*Additional funds that we raise will go towards more advanced post-production, marketing, and advertising.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The hope of this project is to create an informative documentary while gathering video, audio, and hopefully trace evidence of Sasquatch. The larger goal is to get more funding and continue making documentaries to share more anecdotes and to gather additional evidence of the elusive Sasquatch.</p>

For this campaign, I look forward to re-introducing myself and the Chronicles of Carlos brand to the world audience and to telling the stories of Kirk Stewart whose many encounters with Sasquatch over his lifetime living off-the-grid in the Pacific Northwest are captivating as well as compelling. Several of Kirk’s encounters were written about in David Paulides’ book, “ Tribal Bigfoot.” Kirk has encountered these beings playing, found their footprints, hair, and wooden structures, heard their cries and listened to them communicate in their jibber-jabber language, smelled them, and even had one bluff charge him and two hunting companions-- it ran right over the top of him! For this campaign, Kirk has agreed to take us up to the even more remote area where something left all of his provisions but took his gun, moved it some distance away, and buried it! 
This campaign is extremely important to me as I have wanted to create a documentary to discuss the details and share the evidence of my encounters for years now. Over my lifetime I have met many people who have had similar encounters to-- and some quite different from-- my own, and I am excited to tell their stories, too. I hadn’t considered hosting a docu-series before meeting my Director, Chris Narrie, but now I am convinced that this is a much better way to not only share my own Sasquatch encounter stories but also to share the encounters of others that I have met along my lifelong journey into learning more about the Sasquatch people. Your contributions will make this dream a reality and help to give me the means to be in a position, with the help of others like myself, to create video and audio content that pushes the thoughtful conversation forward and helps to disclose one of the greatest mysteries of all time: the reality of our co-existence with the Sasquatch people of the world-- which many still do not know or even believe exist. The magnitude of this disclosure is immeasurable in terms of its impact on modern society and civilization. You can be a part of this paradigm-shifting disclosure!

What We Need 
We are hoping to collect video and audio evidence of Sasquatch.  Most of our budget is going towards equipment in order to give us the best chance of obtaining definitive proof. 
$2000 for a professional thermal camera so that we can capture evidence at night.
$250 for a parabolic microphone to capture vocalization.
$120 for a lens that will allow us to capture images from far away.
$1250 for other film equipment, tripod, lights, batteries, etc.
$1380 to cover all other costs, travel, food, basic post-production, etc.*
*Additional funds that we raise will go towards more advanced post-production, marketing, and advertising.

The Impact
The hope of this project is to create an informative documentary while gathering video, audio, and hopefully trace evidence of Sasquatch. The larger goal is to get more funding and continue making documentaries to share more anecdotes and to gather additional evidence of the elusive Sasquatch.

At the age of 24, I was ready to start this new chapter in life and I decided that I was going in headfirst. Acting allowed me to share with others, to speak up, to challenge my Learning Disabilities, Autism, ADHD, and to pursue my dreams. As an actress, I was able to memorize much more information and my speech gradually became more refined. My new efforts led me to the acting school, John Robert Powers (JRP) in Bloomington, Minnesota where I received further instructions from the industry. It was these lessons that paved the way for my success in acting as I honed my expressions, improved my skills and started my ascent.Felissa Rose Esposito At the age of 13, she landed the role of Angela in the cult film Sleepaway Camp (1983).

<h3>An unexpected dementia story that fills your heart.</h3>
<p>Firstly, thanks for taking the time to find out about our little family story. During the lockdown in Australia in 2020, our family (like many others) experienced many new complexities living with our Oma who has Alzheimer's disease and Vascular Dementia. What unfolded in the months of lockdown was a series of playful video experiments made by our family to help Oma make sense of her home isolation. We made supermarkets, clothes boutiques and even an underwater aquarium for her to enjoy.</p>
<p>We were speechless when our videos went viral with over 50,000,000 views and were featured on countless news networks, blogs and shows such as A Current Affair, The Late Late Show with James Corden and Good Morning America.</p>
<p>We now have a unique opportunity to bring our WHOLE story to the screen for a much bigger audience through telling Oma's story in a documentary. A story that's heartwarming and real. A story that over 56,000 Facebook followers (@OmasApplesauce) have helped us bring to this stage. Now we need to take brave steps and make it a story we can share with everyone, everywhere.</p>
<p>Dementia affects over 50 million worldwide, with millions more involved in the daily care and responsibility of a loved one no longer able to identify with themselves or those that love them. 'Everybody's Oma' will make you laugh and cry in the same breath - and it will provide hope about a stigmatised condition that badly needs it.</p>
<p>Why this crowdfunding campaign? And why now?</p>
<p>This coming Christmas and New Year will be an important milestone in our journey as a family, and we urgently need to hire a crew to film our family during this time. For those that have connected with our little stories already, you'll know everyone in our family has been involved in making them... but now we need to focus on Oma's increasing care needs and allow another filmmaking crew to pick up the story and document us, to help complete our documentary film.</p>
<p>We've already been blessed to attract the expertise of Australian Producer Ros Walker (Walker Films). She's just represented her latest production at Sundance 2020, she's the real deal. Ros brings a raft of knowledge and passion to this production, and we are fortunate to have her join our team.</p>
<p>This is why we've created this crowdfunding page, to see what we can do together. To surround ourselves with wonderfully talented storytellers who can help us complete our story for you. And to give those that want to be more deeply involved with this film a chance to make their mark too.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>This crowdfunding will enable us to complete our filming.</h3>
<p>I've made a multitude of award-winning short films about humanistic stories already, so I know what it takes to connect an audience to that intangible emotive oneness. But I'm also a realist and know that the one constant I can't change is time. Time we need to find for Oma's increasing care needs. Time that won't pause her dementia while we find our own way to film the remainder of our story. Time to capture a chapter of Oma's journey that we'll never be able to get back. Just time.</p>
<p>Here's what we'd use our crowd-funds for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enlist a like-minded documentary cinematographer to film our family over Christmas &amp; January 2021</li>
<li>Commission an experienced editor to create a 15 minute trailer to pitch to distributors</li>
<li>Promotional resources to pitch for further industry funding to complete the film</li>
</ol>
<p>To keep things simple, we're creating just 5 x support levels ('perks') to enable supporters to collaborate with the making of our film. Each support level is deeply valued:</p>
<ul>
<li>$50 Your name in our film credits</li>
<li>$100 Dedication for a loved one lost (text sentence in credits)</li>
<li>$150 Dedication for a loved one lost (name &amp; photo in credits)</li>
<li>$500 Film Ambassador &amp; personalised video for you</li>
<li>$2500 Live Presentation: we'll provide a keynote or Q&amp;A session for your organisation</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Your support will create a big impact.</h3>
<p>I know what our empowering stories about Oma have done already. We receive thousands of comments and messages every month, and see and hear the changes our journey has been able to inspire in YOUR lives. Imagine if we could upscale that to millions more? Imagine if you were a part of a goodwill movement that helps those living with dementia, honours those lost to dementia AND gives families everywhere knowledge about more options for care?</p>
<p>The more we all talk and share ideas the greater our ability. 'Everybody's Oma' will be the ice-breaker for many seeking to normalise their fears, frustrations and build capacity and ideas for new inner hopes.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges.</h3>
<p>I'm a realist, I've been a generous crowd-funder myself and have experienced both the pleasures and pitfalls of this democratised funding system, so I get it. Its not always easy, but take comfort in the the strengths I do bring:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am an experienced, award winning short documentary filmmaker</li>
<li>We have already had over 50 million views on our Oma videos to date</li>
<li>We have an credentialed Producer (Ros Walker) confirmed to be joining our team</li>
<li>We have minimised our family business to focus on Oma and her care needs</li>
<li>We have already amassed tremendous publicity opportunities which we will reconnect with </li>
<li>Our whole family is dedicated in seeing this film get made</li>
<li>Oma's dementia is progressing faster now - we are driven to capture as much of her story as we can, and soon</li>
</ul>
<p>Should we not reach our total funding goal, know that we'll still do everything in our power to complete 'Everybody's Oma' - it may however be on a smaller scale. If we succeed in raising partial funds, those monies will be used for the most critical parts of our documentary's production first. Should we exceed our funding target, we will continue to invest those funds in the ongoing completion stages of the film. We'll report our progress via updates here.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>It's not all about money though...</h3>
<p>Funding contributions are deeply valued but it's certainly not the only way you can help us. In fact I urge you to ONLY buy a pledge if you can comfortably do so without angst, we certainly don't want to make anyone uncomfortable about stretching their funds. Should you wish to support us without a pledge, there's many ways you can have a vital role in seeing this documentary succeed through the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Follow our @OmasApplesauce Facebook page, Instagram page and Youtube channel</li>
<li>Create a post or share our fundraising journey with your audience - maybe you're just one connection away from someone who could help us finish our film?</li>
<li>Use the Indiegogo share tools on this page, to help us attract audience here too</li>
</ol>
<p>And a huge thank you for taking the time to read and consider this project. That's a generous commitment of your time right there. Thank you, from myself (Jason), Oma, Megan and the whole van Genderen family.</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Brant Lewis, and I am a current MFA candidate for the Film and Television program at SCAD. What drove me to pursue Livin’ After Midnight was my passion for utilizing horror and comedy to tell authentic queer stories. Despite being a shy and scared kid growing up, I held a deep attraction to horror. Whether it was curiosity or learning not to be so anxious, I became enamored by it. However, I did not realize how the genre allowed me to think about the concept of queerness and how it pertained to me. Years later, the connection of horror and queerness finally clicked, which made me love it even more. As a result, it became the final nail in the coffin to focus on horror for my career. </p>
<p>During my time in graduate school, most of my work has focused on queer characters where their sexuality and gender do not serve as the focal point of the story nor serves as their sole identity. Similarly, the two queer leads of the film, Robyn and Tyler, live relatively everyday lives despite being vampires. I did not want to do a movie that had queerness be centered around coming out, tragedy, or a death. I wanted to provide a snapshot of everyday queer life. Along those lines, the element of them being vampires provides a way to discuss queer identity in a more organic and deeply emotional manner. Instead of it being superficial, it is thematically richer. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615345584/finz8x31xhma2lkeiuck.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Two queer vampires must navigate the possibility of a relationship after accidentally hunting each other under the guise of a blind date.  </p>
<p>The story is a mix of vampire horror with slice of life romantic comedy.   It is the perfect combination of Fright Night and Weekend, two influential films on the script.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615345632/exnhdoxljbqknlqc4z17.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The total cost of the film is about $7000.  The main costs of the film pertain to below-the-line production, specifically COVID safety. As the risks and challenges section will state it better, we will be practicing strict safety on set and will use the money to buy rapid tests as well as other COVID safety equipment. The funding will also help with casting quality talent for the movie.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615345656/coqqrhossnwfmvkjcvwo.png"" src=""""/>    </p>
<p>For the film, we want to cast queer performers for the two leads exclusively.  We believe that we can get quality talent who can provide authenticity to the roles by doing this.  Along those lines, Robyn, who is non-binary, will only be played by a non-binary performer.  We hope to use SAG performers, but we are also open to the best talent for each of the roles.   Also, we will be casting understudies for the parts as well. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1615345679/q72apfuyq5ji12nrsvec.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The film will be utilizing exclusively practical effects. Aside from the vampire transformation and fangs, the void sequences, where Robyn's inner desires are known, will be done practically. Those sequences will have a vibe similar to the void in Under the Skin, while the bright colored lights will evoke Suspiria (2018) and Possessor. </p>

As the risks and challenges section will state it better, we will be practicing strict safety on set and will use the money to buy rapid tests as well as other COVID safety equipment. The funding will also help with casting quality talent for the movie.  
    
For the film, we want to cast queer performers for the two leads exclusively.  We believe that we can get quality talent who can provide authenticity to the roles by doing this.  Along those lines, Robyn, who is non-binary, will only be played by a non-binary performer.  We hope to use SAG performers, but we are also open to the best talent for each of the roles.   Also, we will be casting understudies for the parts as well. 

The film will be utilizing exclusively practical effects. Aside from the vampire transformation and fangs, the void sequences, where Robyn's inner desires are known, will be done practically. Those sequences will have a vibe similar to the void in Under the Skin, while the bright colored lights will evoke Suspiria (2018) and Possessor.

It started off with 7 black women and then grew rapidly and we were able to <strong>connect &amp; collaborate with almost 30 black female creatives in less than 2 months</strong>, we realised that this initiative was more than just an idea but something that was needed and we wanted to continue and <strong>create stand out work in the industry.</strong></p><p>The sisterhood series is the biggest project we've done so far, we've only been active as a company for 9 months and have been able to <strong>connect &amp; collaborate with various different black female creatives emerging in their careers. </strong></p><p>Your contribution will allow us to go even further with our goals.

 The Impact 7blackwomen started late last year in December, it was stemmed from an inner frustration of constantly waiting for someone to make something happen for us and (Winnie Imara) the founder of 7blackwomen thought lets be bold and create our own work with the what we have. It started off with 7 black women and then grew rapidly and we were able to connect & collaborate with almost 30 black female creatives in less than 2 months, we realised that this initiative was more than just an idea but something that was needed and we wanted to continue and create stand out work in the industry.The sisterhood series is the biggest project we've done so far, we've only been active as a company for 9 months and have been able to connect & collaborate with various different black female creatives emerging in their careers. Your contribution will allow us to go even further with our goals. It will be our greatest achievement yet and finally we will be able to see more black women on screen and behind screen showcasing their talents, the success of this will allow us to continue to create more work in the future and make an impact in our industry as BLACK WOMEN ""7BlackWomen brings together a group of ambitious, imaginative women, and this is a great opportunity to support some exciting new storytellers.

<p>What I loved the most about all the different things I read, watched and played was the adventure.  The big quest.  To slay the dragon.  To free the land from unholy grip of....well you know the rest.  This campaign, The Chronicles of A Broken Path is our first real chance to step into that realm.  To make the kinds of fantasy/action/adventure films that we don't see enough of.  Independently.  You could say that this is the first step of our Q<i>uest</i>. </p>
<p>Imagine the world of Lord of The Rings,  with the combat of The Witcher, magic like Naruto with the conflict and depth of character of Game of Thrones.  We want to make an action heavy fantasy world, full of magic and combat.  Monks that can crack a warrior's armor with a single punch.  Warlocks that wield blades imbued with enough mana to destroy a group of enemies.   A world full of diverse characters and races involved in multilayered conflict that will only be resolved by treachery, martial arts, diplomacy and sorcery.  And we need you to join with us on that quest.  To be part of our ""Fellowship of the Film"" if you will.  The next couple of projects we make in this world will be self funded but this first one is the most ambitious of them. projects and that's why we need your help.   <strong>Will you join with us on this dangerous journey?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621204629/fhvo5amyvimoktghylqb.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What this Quest Needs from you....</h3>
<p>We need to raise $5,000.00 to do this right.  But if you noticed, the campaign is only for $2,500....we'll get to why that is a little later..... Almost all of that money is going to locations, cast and crew.   We have already spent thousands of dollars on all the cameras, costumes, insurance, stunt gear and safety equipment necessary to complete this project and begin making this world we created a reality.  </p>
<p>We have a really cool opportunity.  You see we pitched a few people on the idea and they loved it.  They agreed to fund half of the project via a Dollar for Dollar match so we really need your help!   We even spoke with some distributors about the project and they needed to see a sample of the work before we could move forward with them.   </p>
<p>There isn't an easy way to do something of this caliber and employing this many people.  If we could condense the project and lower the cost we would.  We just don't believe that the scale we are trying to convey and the world we are trying to build will be served by doing that.  We're going all in on this one, pulling out all the stops and we really hope that you come along with us on that ride.  This won't be the only project we create for you all.  There are others coming soon but they don't require this kind of budget.  The more we raise the more projects we get to create.  If we raised $100,000 we'd just shoot the feature! But that's a big goal so we're focused on the shorts right now and they will serve to further flesh out the world and prove to investors that people want to see this kind of project.  There will be other people outside our team involved in creating the history and lore of this thing as well.  The world will be immersive and expansive as it will connect with another ""universe"" from another sci fi creator based out of California!  We intend to continue having fans help us create the history of this world in partnership with us by making their OWN projects that we can canonize!</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">There  are a lot of ways for a short film to go off the rails, and trust me we learned that the hard way.  But you can trip upstairs and if you plan it right you can fail forward.  We have some of the most talented individuals we know involved in all aspects of the project  to make sure that skip the pitfalls.  This is a community project and everyone is excited to get this going! Our condensed crew has been making projects together for a few years now and we've gotten pretty good at it.  Most of the people involved are filmmaker hybrid (preditors) just like us.  </span></p>

UPDATE: We have hot our goal! Thank you so much! As we said, we didn't plan on doing any more crowd funds for this series of projects. So the additional funds we raise go towards the next shorts in the series. Those will also be used to raise funds from investors/distributors for the $100,000 feature.  Thank you all for the continued support! Thank you for getting involved!! We cannot believe how successful this is becoming!!

What I loved the most about all the different things I read, watched and played was the adventure.  The big quest.  To slay the dragon.  To free the land from unholy grip of....well you know the rest.  This campaign, The Chronicles of A Broken Path is our first real chance to step into that realm.  To make the kinds of fantasy/action/adventure films that we don't see enough of.  Independently.  You could say that this is the first step of our Quest. 
Imagine the world of Lord of The Rings,  with the combat of The Witcher, magic like Naruto with the conflict and depth of character of Game of Thrones.  We want to make an action heavy fantasy world, full of magic and combat.  Monks that can crack a warrior's armor with a single punch.  Warlocks that wield blades imbued with enough mana to destroy a group of enemies.   A world full of diverse characters and races involved in multilayered conflict that will only be resolved by treachery, martial arts, diplomacy and sorcery.  And we need you to join with us on that quest.  To be part of our ""Fellowship of the Film"" if you will.  The next couple of projects we make in this world will be self funded but this first one is the most ambitious of them. projects and that's why we need your help.   Will you join with us on this dangerous journey?
 


What this Quest Needs from you....
We need to raise $5,000.00 to do this right.  But if you noticed, the campaign is only for $2,500....we'll get to why that is a little later..... Almost all of that money is going to locations, cast and crew.   We have already spent thousands of dollars on all the cameras, costumes, insurance, stunt gear and safety equipment necessary to complete this project and begin making this world we created a reality.  
We have a really cool opportunity.  You see we pitched a few people on the idea and they loved it.  They agreed to fund half of the project via a Dollar for Dollar match so we really need your help!   We even spoke with some distributors about the project and they needed to see a sample of the work before we could move forward with them.   
There isn't an easy way to do something of this caliber and employing this many people.  If we could condense the project and lower the cost we would.  We just don't believe that the scale we are trying to convey and the world we are trying to build will be served by doing that.  We're going all in on this one, pulling out all the stops and we really hope that you come along with us on that ride.  This won't be the only project we create for you all.  There are others coming soon but they don't require this kind of budget.  The more we raise the more projects we get to create.  If we raised $100,000 we'd just shoot the feature! But that's a big goal so we're focused on the shorts right now and they will serve to further flesh out the world and prove to investors that people want to see this kind of project.  There will be other people outside our team involved in creating the history and lore of this thing as well.  The world will be immersive and expansive as it will connect with another ""universe"" from another sci fi creator based out of California!  We intend to continue having fans help us create the history of this world in partnership with us by making their OWN projects that we can canonize!

Here there be Dragons.....
There  are a lot of ways for a short film to go off the rails, and trust me we learned that the hard way.  But you can trip upstairs and if you plan it right you can fail forward.  We have some of the most talented individuals we know involved in all aspects of the project  to make sure that skip the pitfalls.  This is a community project and everyone is excited to get this going! Our condensed crew has been making projects together for a few years now and we've gotten pretty good at it.  Most of the people involved are filmmaker hybrid (preditors) just like us.  
 
 
Ballistic Blade Entertainment and Wild Canvas Media have collaborated on a number of festival award winning and nominated projects. 

Matt Poitras of MP FilmCraft creates period accurate custom leather work from Han Solo belts to Viking and Scythian armor from scratch.  His work is amazing and we're delighted to have him onboard! 

Beaux Loy is an award winning vfx artist with crazy skills.  We are happy to have him aboard helping with the effects on screen!

There is a lot of fighting in this project so we will be doing a ton of training with the cast.   Jungle Movement Academy in Round Rock, TX and Cougar Tae Kwon Do in Jarrell, TX have graciously sponsored this project and offered us training space!  


Finally we have the team over at Austin Action Fest & Market assisting with promotion and functioning as a sales agent for the project!  Through Austin Action Fest we have already been speaking with international distributors about where this goes next.

<h2>BAD GIRLS </h2>
<p><i><strong>We</strong></i> are producing an eye-popping feature-length <i>underground film</i> and we guarantee it is unlike anything else. The film wrapped shooting just days before the pandemic lockdown and has been in post-production since. We are aiming for a release in both physical and digital formats in early 2021. We are inviting fans of alternative cinema (arthouse to grindhouse) to <strong><i>join our team </i></strong>to help us pay final post-production costs, get the movie over the finish line, and become part of <i>motion picture history.</i> </p>
<p>BAD GIRLS is produced by Crystal Colligan and Christopher Bickel. It was directed by Mr. Bickel and stars Morgan Shaley Renew, Sanethia Dresch, and Shelby Lois Guinn. </p>
<p>BAD GIRLS gleefully subverts genre tropes in spinning its lurid, hyperreal tale of desire, love, chaos and violence. After robbing a strip club, three desperate teenage girls lead a misogynistic Federal Agent on a lysergic cross-country chase -- scoring a duffle bag full of money, d**gs, and a crew of willing kidnapees along the way.</p>
<p>""These are characters people haven't seen before, interacting in a world that is almost-but-not-quite our own,"" says director Christopher Bickel of the ""exaggerated reality"" of the BAD GIRLS universe. ""When you're making a movie for the<i> cost of a used car</i>, you're forced to get creative with the storytelling in ways that Hollywood focus-groups don't allow. You won't find BAD GIRLS in a Walmart <i>because it doesn't belong in a Walmart."" </i></p>
<p>Due to platform constraints, this campaign presents a family-friendly cut of our trailer. To see the full-cut of the trailer, check out <a href=""http://www.badgirlsmovie.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.badgirlsmovie.com</a>. </p>

<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<p>BAD GIRLS was shot on a shoestring and every bit of money we had available to us went into the production. From paying the cast and crew to making sure everyone had food to securing our locations and rental of the plethora of classic cars used in the film. We now find a number of miscellaneous costs to complete the film and to get it released. True to our DIY<strong><i> punk rock</i></strong> roots, we are planning to do our own distribution -- so there are a number of costs involved in that.</p>
<p>We believe that the best way to raise these funds is to pre-sell the film and related mechandise. Furthermore, we are giving the promise that those who help us out now will be <strong><i>the first people to see and own a copy of the film. </i></strong></p>
<p>We have made a conscious effort to make all of the ""perks"" in this campaign <strong><i>appropriately priced and affordable.</i></strong> Our perks are ""a la carte"" and not cumulative -- select the items you'd like individually and save! We are offering physical format in the form of a Blu Ray <strong><i>loaded with extras</i></strong> as well as a digital release. Once again, contributors to this campaign will be the<strong><i> first to get a copy</i></strong> -- likely a month <strong><i>before the general public. </i></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Background</strong></h3>
<p>BAD GIRLS will be a second film for underground producer/director Christopher Bickel. His first film, THE THETA GIRL, was widely critically acclaimed and has been distributed all over the world. Though made for roughly the same amount of money as THE THETA GIRL, BAD GIRLS is a much bigger and more complex production. Film Threat's Chris Gore described THE THETA GIRL as <i>""a film that warped my mind,""</i> Here's what other critics had to say about Bickel's first film, THE THETA GIRL:<br/> </p>
<ul>
<li><i>""One of the best exploitation films in a generation"" - <u>Nevermore Horror </u></i></li>
<li><i>""This film explodes onto the screen like the lovechild of Ted V. Mikels and Jodorowsky, skull-f**ks you like a tag team of Blue Sunshine and Blood Feast, and when it's done you will say, ""Thank you, may I have another."" - <u>Psycho Drive-In</u></i></li>
<li><i>""Far, far better than it has any right to be... This is the kind of movie that microbudget indie producers should be studying to up their filmmaking game."" - <u>The Slaughtered Bird</u></i></li>
<li><i>""In its wildest moments, you can feel the same sort of creativity and mania of young Sam Raimi and Peter Jackson, cobbling together action and horror out of not-much-at-all."" - <u><i>Cinapse</i></u></i></li>
<li><i>""Perfectly capturing the look and feel of earlier films THE THETA GIRL carves out its own niche by upping the ante with even more sex and violence than we would have seen in the films it clearly loves so much. This is a kind of perfect distillation of the exploitation genre that would have been a cult classic back in the day...and is destined to be one in today... This is one of my favorite (and possibly one of the very best) films of 2018."" - <u><i>Unseenfilms.net</i></u></i></li>
<li><i>""THE THETA GIRL is a remarkably inventive, psychedelically captivating, micro-budget mind-banger presently mushrooming into the consciousness of indie fright fare fans, particularly those with a bent toward bravura brain blasting derring-do... THE THETA GIRL is a knockout accomplishment by any standards."" -- <u>Mike McPadden, Daily Grindhouse</u></i></li>

Cleveland Langdale and Micah Peroulis star as two cult rock stars kidnapped by the girl gang. Jonathan Benton stars as a geeky hotel clerk swept up in the madness.

We went to the North of Vietnam with a crew of musicians, and I could feel the presence of my grandmother in their music and in the landscape of the nature there.I finally took part in a mission I had not imagined when leaving France...Why should you become a producer?The documentary was made with a team of hard-working and committed volunteers without a budget. We need your support to pay a French professional studio who will provide us with a wider platform to show our documentary to the world. Your funding will also contribute towards an international sustainable project which aims to grow bamboo trees in Vietnam.  10% of the total amount (=1200€) will be used to raise money for the forest of Yen Bai in the North of Vietnam where we shot a part of the documentary. The forest will provide water to many, improve air quality for all, and ensure that the ground does not erode and cause further damage to this beautiful yet fragile ecosystem. Every 20 euros you plant a bamboo tree in Vietnam With your generous contributions our team will send you regular updates, and exclusive behind the scenes content, as well as an accredited mention on our documentary.  POSTPRODUCTION/7000€ (editing, color grading and sound design)TRANSLATION/2000€ (French, English, Vietnamese)MARKETING/1200€ (ads on social networks, website, inbound and outbound marketing)COPYRIGHT/1000€ (secure the footage and the sound)FESTIVALS/800€ (submit the movie to international competition) Your support will promote VietnamBecause the post-covid era needs to refresh cultural bridges between countries, Once Upon a Bridge in Vietnam aims to close that gap as it celebrates Vietnam through both classical music and Vietnamese music.More than digital tourism, this documentary is an exploration of cross-cultural languages through musical composition, an insight into the rich and wonderful history of Vietnam and its conflict and reconciliation with France. Both history and music lovers will thoroughly enjoy this in depth study into the colorful and vibrant world of Vietnamese music culture.  Women leaders and young musiciansMost of the interviews were conducted with female musicians who represent a source of inspiration for Western countries.  We interviewed people from four different generations including one young musician based in Norway. These talented musicians are testament to the international influence of music culture, and are an inspiration for other young women who dream of becoming musicians themselves. From the Hanoi Opera House to ethnic music in the jungleThe beauty of the documentary lies in its transmutability; to travel from the Hanoi opera house to jungles and rice-fields in the countryside, from international music to ethnic music. These combinations bring unique contrasts that inspired many composers in Vietnam.It shows that Vietnam is a very special country with a very diverse music scene and a united music community.The soundtrackThe music used is performed by the Vietnam National Symphony Orchestra (music director Honna Tetsuji), the Green Sound project musicians (music director Phan Thuy) and the Hope Choir (music director Tôn Thât Triêm). In the trailer, you can hear Những kỷ niệm quê hương composed by Hoàng Dương and played by the Vietnam National Symphony Orchestra, and Echo Sound composed by Hồ Hoài Anh, Arr. Phan Thủy, played by The Green Sound.The choice of the soundtrack highlights the connection between Vietnamese traditional music and western classical music with beautiful compositions.A starting point for researchThe documentary is also a tool to prompt music lovers and universities to focus on more about the richness of music history in Vietnam.Press ReviewVietnamese

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><i>The Hell With Nike</i> follows Darien, a middle aged man who wanders city streets, occupying his day with the company of his best friend Nik, who happens to be a shoe. When Nik convinces Darien to engage in a life of crime, Darien faces a complicated decision: Is his relationship with Nik putting his own life in jeopardy?</p>
<h3>About the Project</h3>
<p>My name is Dakota Linder. I am the writer/director of The Hell to Nike. Born in Hastings, MN my family and I moved to Scobey, MT when I was about five. I finished High School in Scobey then decided to attend film school in Bozeman, MT. This will be my third year at MSU and it's safe to say I’m doing what I love.</p>
<p>This idea came to me when I thought back to middle school. These people I called my friends didn't make me happy but I stayed with them because I was afraid to be alone. However the more I matured the more I realized that sometimes to be happy you need to accept that you need to be alone.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>The funding of this film is essential to its development and as students at Montana State University, we cannot provide sufficient funding to develop this project with a finished product of professional quality. Thanks to the School of Film and Photography at MSU, we have the ability to rent equipment without any expenses. Therefore, the funding for this film will go to different areas such as set design, costumes, and food for our cast and crew. A detailed list of estimated expenses are shown below:</p>
<ul>
<li>$150 - Wardrobe</li>
<li>$800 - Food for Cast and Crew</li>
<li>$350 - Set Design</li>
<li>$50 - Covid Supplies</li>
<li>$150 - Misc. Supplies</li>
<li>$50 - Post Production</li>
<li>$100 - Film Festivals</li>
<li>$450 - Money for Unforeseen Circumstances: Having extra funds for the random, inevitable problems or complications that can arise on set is essential so that production can continue to run smoothly. Any excess funds not used for the production of <i>The Hell With Nike </i>will be donated to COVID relief organizations. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your donations will help provide young student filmmakers to gain experience working on a film set. The experience gained from this project will help these filmmakers to achieve their goals as they ready to enter the film industry.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenge</h3>
<p>Due to the unfortunate circumstances and health risks posed by COVID-19, our set will follow a list of COVID regulations that will ensure the health and safety of all cast and crew be preserved. That list is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temperatures of all cast and crew will be checked once before entering the set, and once after the set has been wrapped for the day. </li>
<li>Cast and crew will be required to sign a wellness check upon entering set, and are asked that should they display any symptoms to please alert the production crew as soon as possible. </li>
<li>Masks will be worn at all times. Actors may remove their masks only while filming a scene, afterwards masks must be put back on until they are to go on camera again. </li>
<li>Hand sanitizer and sanitizing equipment will be provided on set to ensure a clean environment. </li>
<li>CDC guidelines and those that the professional film industry follows today will be instated on set.</li>

<h3>Alright, what the Hell is this?</h3>
<p>Glad you asked.  <i>Up North </i>is a film we've been working on since late 2018. In brief, it's a film about an estranged small-town family reunited by the death of a man who was either wise, crazy, or a little of both.</p>
<p>In the not-so-brief... well, I'll get to that.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>You're asking for a decent chunk of change. What do you need it for?</h3>
<p>Nearly every cent raised from this campaign will go toward the housing, feeding, and ethical payment of cast and crew. Everything else, from camera equipment to wardrobe to locations, is already accounted for. We're raising money because we refuse to exploit people in pursuit of our vision .</p>
<h3>Fair enough. But why should <i>I</i> care?</h3>
<p>Alright, here's the ""not-so-brief"" I was talking about earlier. </p>
<p>This movie is about a lot of things. It's about faith, though maybe not what people often mean when they say that. It's about family, but I wouldn't call it a ""family film"". And it's a film about queer identity, but it goes a little bit beyond a lesson about how you should be nice to that gay kid in your class (not to downplay the very important work being done in those spaces, but this isn't that). This is a film that will attempt - using everything we've learned to this point, both as filmmakers and as human beings - to say something incredibly, facilely obvious in a brand-new way.</p>
<p>Our tagline gives it away. This is a film about kindness.</p>
<h3>Alright, Socrates. You've told me the philosophy. But how is this gonna look?</h3>
<p>Stylistically, I'd describe what we're going for as the exact midpoint between 3<i> Billboards </i>and <i>Call Me By Your Name</i>. Essentially, a lowkey, rural style with a lot of jokes and snappy dialogue, which, by their contrast, give extra weight to interspersed scenes of profound personal realization, the kind that transcends all the talking everyone is doing.</p>
<p>Basically, imagine a cross between a comedy, a Western, and a Renaissance altarpiece, and you'll have an idea of what we want our film to look like.</p>
<h3>Sounds heavy. You really think you can pull it off?</h3>
</div><div>
<p>Won't be easy, that's for sure. But with your help, we can make it happen.  </p>
<p>If the goal is reached, I can say with confidence that we can hit the ground running in November. If not, all signs point to a rollout happening in March.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Did... did you put ""Gnosticism"" in the tags?</h3>
<p>Don't worry about it.</p>
<p>Anyway, if you're unable to donate yourself, and you sympathize with what we're trying to do, please share this campaign around. I know it's a cliché, but every bit really does help.</p>
<h3>Wait just one minute. I'm still not entirely convinced. Describe to me one scene from your movie that you think might sway me.</h3>
<p>Okay, here goes nothing.</p>
<p>A man is walking. Where, we don't know, but we know that it's a city, and it's huge. The throngs of people on the street keep bumping into the man, who looks as though he can barely stand. Sure enough, he falls, and a passing taxi splashes water into his face, blinding him. The man sits there, alone and overwhelmed, and it seems, for a moment, that despair will overtake him. But just then, a hand reaches down from out of the crowd and pulls him to his feet. By the time the man has opened his eyes, whoever helped him up is gone. But he will remember this moment, and do his best to carry it forward.</p>
<p>We know this, because we are introduced to this scene when he describes it to another character, a local who, out of curiosity, has visited him in his rickety shack. He acts out the scene for her, and the shack he's in couldn't be more different from a busy city street. But as he does, the sounds of that day are heard, as if the spirit of that moment is intruding on the present.</p>
<p>One simple act of kindness, which resonates throughout an entire lifetime. </p>

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>My name is Adrian Țofei, I'm an independent filmmaker and actor, my first movie, <a href=""https://bemycatafilmforanne.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>Be My Cat: A Film for Anne</i></a>, received international acclaim, and now I need your support to make my next feature films <i>We Put the World to Sleep</i> and <i>Die Bully Die</i>.</p>
<p><i>We Put the World to Sleep</i> is a found footage apocalyptic antihero feature film about three young idealists disappointed with the world who join forces and embark on a mission to bring everything to an end. Directed, produced &amp; written by me, starring Erisse Peterson, Duru Yücel Țofei &amp; myself, with Jay Sorensen and Danha Yunes attached as Executive Producers.</p>
<p>Shooting is scheduled for June 2018. I plan to do it based on controlled improvisation, just like I did <i>Be My Cat: A Film for Anne</i>, then premiere it in one of the world’s top film festivals (Cannes, Sundance, TIFF, Venice, Berlin, Telluride, SXSW, Tribeca), secure a top distributor, travel the festival circuit and get a limited theatrical release, or at least all the major VOD platforms. </p>
<p>Right after I send <i>We Put the World to Sleep</i> to the first round of festivals, I want to start the production for <i>Die Bully Die</i> using the same <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1785760384788968&amp;set=pb.100000650711060.-2207520000.1520465448.&amp;type=1&amp;theater"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">equipment</a> to cut on costs. <i>Die Bully Die</i> will be a revenge horror movie about a guy in his thirties who plans revenge on everyone who bullied him in kindergarten, school and high-school. </p>

<h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2>
<p>Both movies are only partially funded. We need at least $3,000 more. Because of the improvisational method I am using, I cannot find a production company to finance the projects. The companies need a script and I do not work this way, I spend a lot of time living in character and years preparing the circumstances that would lead during shootings to authentic results identical to genuine life events. I create an alternative reality that speaks for itself. And I need your support to do that. You are our last hope of bringing these two projects to life the way they should be brought.

<p>What you get are all kinds of goodies like VIP streaming (the team's private screener to watch the movies before release), links to download the movies, thanks credits at the end of the movies and on IMDb, signed DVDs/Blu-rays, and even associate producer or executive producer credits! You can choose a different movie for each item in a perk.

<p>As very expressive child, Duru always had a playful existence which later proved itself when she sang in front of the whole class in primary school and staged impressions of all her teachers during secondary school.

From that moment on, she came to know very clearly the fact that she wanted to be an actress.</p>
<p>Duru likes singing, especially jazz, and has a demo she handed out just to her family and friends.

Short Summary
My name is Adrian Țofei, I'm an independent filmmaker and actor, my first movie, Be My Cat: A Film for Anne, received international acclaim, and now I need your support to make my next feature films We Put the World to Sleep and Die Bully Die.
We Put the World to Sleep is a found footage apocalyptic antihero feature film about three young idealists disappointed with the world who join forces and embark on a mission to bring everything to an end. Directed, produced & written by me, starring Erisse Peterson, Duru Yücel Țofei & myself, with Jay Sorensen and Danha Yunes attached as Executive Producers.
Shooting is scheduled for June 2018. I plan to do it based on controlled improvisation, just like I did Be My Cat: A Film for Anne, then premiere it in one of the world’s top film festivals (Cannes, Sundance, TIFF, Venice, Berlin, Telluride, SXSW, Tribeca), secure a top distributor, travel the festival circuit and get a limited theatrical release, or at least all the major VOD platforms. 
Right after I send We Put the World to Sleep to the first round of festivals, I want to start the production for Die Bully Die using the same equipment to cut on costs. Die Bully Die will be a revenge horror movie about a guy in his thirties who plans revenge on everyone who bullied him in kindergarten, school and high-school. 


What We Need & What You Get
Both movies are only partially funded. We need at least $3,000 more. Because of the improvisational method I am using, I cannot find a production company to finance the projects. The companies need a script and I do not work this way, I spend a lot of time living in character and years preparing the circumstances that would lead during shootings to authentic results identical to genuine life events. I create an alternative reality that speaks for itself. And I need your support to do that. You are our last hope of bringing these two projects to life the way they should be brought. You can learn more about the huge potential of the found footage concept combined with controlled improvisation in my Found Footage Manifesto. 
What you get are all kinds of goodies like VIP streaming (the team's private screener to watch the movies before release), links to download the movies, thanks credits at the end of the movies and on IMDb, signed DVDs/Blu-rays, and even associate producer or executive producer credits! You can choose a different movie for each item in a perk.

Donators will be the first to see the film once it's finished.
Donators can be an extra in the movie if you live near Oregon.

Thank You!
Because of everyone who helped me make Neutral I was able to complete a film that I am beyond proud of. Neutral is by far my biggest achievement. I would love to do it all over again!
Thank you for reading!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I love making movies. I recently was blown away by the film ""1917"" for it's one-take look and impeccable pre-production and cinematography. It inspired me to make a film that would also be shot as one continuous take so I chose a location and wrote a script to the land.  </p>
<p>I usually shoot films on a zero dollar budget and make it happen the best I can. This time, I want to go the extra mile to make a truly unique and captivating film that is different than what everyone else is doing.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am asking for $3,000. This will cover a number of different items that require funding I am simply unable to provide myself to include: The entrance fee to shoot on location at Ruby, rented professional camera stabilizers, other more advanced cinema support equipment for maximum picture results, A hired Cinematographer, food and water for the cast and crew, the cast's wardrobe, multiple support vehicle rentals and more.</p>
<p>Ways of saying thank you!</p>
<p>* $5.00 or more: Get a thank you with your name in the credits</p>
<p>* $10.00 or more: Receive a signed copy of the screenplay by the cast and myself</p>
<p>* $20.00 or more: Attend the virtual premier and be one of the first to see the film </p>
<p>* $50.00 or more: Receive a signed movie poster by the cast and crew</p>
<p>* $100.00 or more: You will be listed as an executive producer prominently in the credits and movie poster and will acquire IMDb credit.</p>
<p>* $500.00 or more: You will name the lead protagonist!</p>
<p>All amounts given are helpful and appreciated!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This film is more than just a film. This is an opportunity to participate in something truly unique </p>
<ul>
<li>This film will be shot to look as if it occurs in one long continuous take which is very different than may other short films.</li>
<li>This film will draw attention to Ruby Arizona as an attraction to encourage people come and visit this historical town and drive funding for the conservation mission that Ruby is dedicated to.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>To produce a movie that looks like a long continuous take requires MASSIVE PLANNING! There is also more margin for error and you don't have the luxury of editing like you normally do. So ensuring we have the right equipment and crew to get job done is critical.</p>
<p>I excel at pre-production and plan for challenging shoots well and I am confident that I have accounted for potential issue that may come up.  Now I just need the funds to acquire the tools necessary to make this film a success.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I understand not everyone is able to give money, but there are other ways you can help! </p>
<p>- Lending or donating equipment that otherwise will be rented</p>

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Still Small Theatre Troupe was started in late 2012, and has performed a number of original works since that time. Our first play, <i>The Prophet Project</i>, was recognized with the 2013 Making a Difference in Christian Service Award from Gordon Conwell Theological Seminary. We're based in Beverly, MA, but tour to pretty much anywhere people want us!</p>
<p>Our shows are not specifically for Christian audiences; they're for anyone who wants to enjoy thought-provoking art. All of our performances are followed by a talkback in which the audience can discuss the show with the cast and crew (and sometimes the author!).</p>
<p>We are currently producing a film adaptation of our original musical <i>Diary of Perpetua. </i>Over 340 million Christians face abuses ranging from job and housing discrimination to rape, imprisonment, and execution solely because of their faith. Many people are unaware of their plight, and many of those suffering are unaware that anyone hears their story. Those who do hear about it are often overwhelmed by the brutality of what goes on.</p>
<p>We aim to inspire the free world to help and learn from these people, and to let those suffering know they are not alone, by producing a film that presents their story in a way that engages rather than overwhelms. We are a grassroots company that is run entirely by volunteers and independent contractors. We don't have deep pockets, but we have deep hearts and a lot of determination to see this project through.  We are campaigning for aid in funding our upcoming film, <i>The Diary of Perpetua</i>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; Where It’s Going</strong></p>
<p>            Our goal is to raise $12,000 dollars for the film with your help!  Your donation would be going towards physically producing the film, securing venues, creating costumes and props, marketing, compensating our cast and crew, and providing you with exciting perks.  Some of perks for donating include VIP passes, special edition DVDs, T-Shirts signed by the cast, your very own handmade props, and more!  We have perks for all donation amounts because every contribution matters, and we are grateful for any amount you are able to donate.  The funds generated will be going towards these purposes even if we do not reach our entire goal.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>When we first performed <i>The Diary of Perpetua </i>as a staged reading with minimal costumes, staging, and a handful of actors, we invited a representative from a large persecution relief organization to share at our post-show discussion.  After seeing the show, she told us in tears, “I’ve met persecuted Christians; I’ve heard their stories; I <i>tell</i> their stories… and I’ve never connected with them this deeply before.”  Plays, film, and music have a way of reaching our hearts and remaining in our imaginations in ways that news items cannot.  Audience and actors alike consistently come away from this show deeply affected, and we can’t wait for God to use this to touch many more lives!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>As this is our first major film, we are learning a lot and appreciate your prayers for the logistics of our production process.  We ask that you pray for protection against any unforeseen challenges that may arise and for wisdom to move through them!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>Even if you are unable to make a financial donation, we still appreciate your support of the project.  As you come across this, please spread the word within your communities and invite your friends to donate or see the film!  You can also use Idiegogo’s share tools to get the word out.  And ... we're still casting for extras!

Judging by the first week's dailies, this will be my best and most ambitious film. Thank you all for your support! I'm certain we will receive distribution, but we still need to raise finishing funds to complete the movie. In the meantime, we will begin shipping those reward perks which are now available. THE PITCHGUNS OF EDEN is a feature length action movie written and directed by Gregory Lamberson, starring Alexandra Faye Sadeghian, Lynn Lowry and Debbie Rochon. Our goal is nothing less than to make a movie that will be seen as a classic in the future.  We've raised enough in contributions and donations to cover pre-production and principal photography, but need more to cover post-production (picture editing, sound editing, music scoring, color grading, sound mixing) and film festival expenses. We're offering some of the best reward perks out there. Join the team today!THE STORYGUNS OF EDEN is a feature length action movie written, directed and produced by award-winning author and filmmaker Gregory Lamberson, who describes it as “a cross between DELIVERANCE and FIRST BLOOD, with a female hero and a dash of THE WARRIORS.""Megan Forest is a cop in Buffalo, New York suffering from PTSD after accidentally killing a fellow police officer. Megan’s partner Jeremy persuades her to go camping with himself and two married friends, Blake and Gabriella. While hiking in the woods, Megan and Jeremy witness the execution of an unarmed drug dealer by Sheriff John Preacher and his deputies - and they are seen by the killers. The four campers run for their lives, but the deputies seal off the woods and Preacher summons different factions of an armed militia to hunt them down, triggering an all out war. WRITER-DIRECTOR-PRODUCER GREGORY LAMBERSONGregory Lamberson is an award-winning author and filmmaker who has worked on independent films since 1984, when he served as the production manager on the horror-comedy I WAS A TEENAGE ZOMBIE at the age of 19. Two years later, he wrote and directed his first feature, SLIME CITY, which became an international cult classic. He has directed eight feature films, most recently WIDOW’S POINT starring Craig Sheffer, and has worked on many others, including Frank Henenlotter’s BRAIN DAMAGE,  Debbie Rochon’s MODEL HUNGER, and Christopher Ray’s ASSAULT ON VA-33.Lamberson has authored 15 books and is the co-founder of Buffalo Dreams Fantastic Film Festival. His films have won numerous awards on the film festival circuit, and in 2019 the Shawna Shea Film Festival presented him with its prestigious William C. Gerrity Award, named after the renowned Hollywood legend who worked as an assistant director, production manager, and producer. Lamberson lives in Buffalo, New York with his wife Tamar, who co-produces his films, and their daughter Kaelin, who has acted in some of them.STRAIGHT TALK FROM THE DIRECTORHello, Film Supporters:Although I’m most closely associated with the horror genre, I love films of all kinds, especially police thrillers and crime dramas.  I’ve been developing GoE for 25 years, and can’t wait to get started. We will make this movie, it will be released, and you will receive your perks. Your contributions will not be wasted, and every contributor will see his name in the credits.The ScreenplayI wrote the first draft of the screenplay for GUNS OF EDEN (then called GOD’S COUNTRY, and later MEGAN’S WAR) back in 1996. I’ve worked on it obsessively over the last year, and the story is more relevant today than when I started it. A good screenplay is the foundation of every good movie, and I believe this is the best I’ve written.Creative GoalsI aim to create a film in the spirit of DELIVERANCE, FIRST BLOOD, and SOUTHERN COMFORT. Other influences include BILLY JACK, CAPRICORN ONE, ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 and RACE WITH THE DEVIL. I 've blogged extensively about these films and others in our Updates section. Despite its 70s and 80s inspirations, GUNS OF EDEN will be a modern thriller with wall-to-wall action. I would love to see this become the first in a series of films centered around the lead character, Megan Forest.A Winning TeamJust like Lee Marvin in THE DIRTY DOZEN and Richard Burton in THE WILD GEESE, I’m assembling a crackerjack team to help me realize my vision. Tamar Lamberson is producing with me,  as she did on JOHNNY GRUESOME and WIDOW'S POINT, and Chris Cosgrave, an expert on action cinema techniques, is Co-Producing. Chris will shoot the film, choreograph some of the action, and create visual effects (some utilizing miniatures).  Keith Lukowski, who is providing much of our gear, is also on board as Co-Producer.Phil Gallo, who scored the cult horror films MOTHER’S DAY and THE REDEEMER, and directed WEST NEW YORK and MATTY FRESNO AND THE HOLOFLUX UNIVERSE, has been my trusted editor since 1995, and will once again pull my bacon out of the fire when necessary. Armand John Petri and Joe Rozler, who co-composed the outstanding scores for my films KILLER RACK, JOHNNY GRUESOME, and WIDOW’S POINT, will return. Between them they have done excellent work for Manowar, the Goo Goo Dolls, 10,000 Maniacs, and many other rock bands. In this video, Armand previews the score for GUNS OF EDEN..MEET OUR PRINCIPAL CAST We’ve cast up and coming NYC actress Alexandra Faye Sadeghian in the starring role of Megan Forest, and I look forward to collaborating with her to create a truly memorable screen hero.  Other cast members so far include Bill Kennedy as Sheriff John Preacher, our primary villain;  “Trazz” Johnson will play Jeremy Scott, Megan’s police partner;  We are proud to announce that the great Lynn Lowry has accepted the key role of Frances, a recluse who helps Megan Forest when she most needs it! We are pleased to announce the addition of the great Debbie Rochon to our cast in the role of Annie, leader of the ""girl group"" the Betsys! We are pleased to announce the casting of the great Brooke Lewis Bellas in the role of Darcy, a foul mouthed member of the militia! Nicole Alshahen  has been cast as Gabriella Peterson, a social worker;  Dominic Luongo was the first person cast, as Blake Peterson, an everyman high school teacher;

<p>I cannot thank all of my current donors enough for their support in this.</p>
</div></div>","Short Summary

My name is Kimberly Terasaki and I am a student film maker working on this passion project.
I am a relative newcomer to the fandom but was inspired by the drive and creativity of other fans, as well as a number of other horror properties including but not limited to: The Blair Witch Project, Halloween 2018, Never Hike Alone, and YouTube culture in general.
With no new ""Friday the 13th"" movies on the horizon, it falls to fans to keep the franchise alive in whatever ways we can. This is my contribution to that work.

What We Need & What You Get

We need money to rent / buy props and camera / sound equipment to present the most realistic and high quality film we can.
In exchange for your contributions, we offer: $1 = postcard, $3 = download of the movie and all supplementary materials, $5 = poster (signed or pristine, you choose), $15 = Camp Crystal Lake Counselor Shirt, $55 = executive producer credit and early access to the script and first screening, $75 = producer credit and access to the script and first screening.
We also offer the opportunity to purchase props / costumes used in the shoot: $15 = a shirt of a character used in the shoot, $40 = camp crystal lake sign, Poseable Body / Victim of Jason Voorhees $85.
The money will still go to the project as the project will get made no matter how much money we earn.

The Impact

Friday the 13th fans are some of the most dedicated I have ever seen, as shown by their massive support for Friday the 13th The Game and other independent projects. Even if we do not raise enough money,  I want to assure people that.
This is my first big project, but I have done many smaller short films, which I would be happy to provide.
Have any questions as to how your contribution is being used? Email me anytime and I will answer in the message / set up a google meet so we can build the trust of creator and benefactor.


Risks & Challenges

I know that making a fan film is risky, especially with so many moving parts. Casting alone took weeks longer than I was expecting.
I am both good at planning and at improvising, both of which are highly necessary when working on a small project.
The project will be made no matter what, even if I have to film it on my iPhone. However, if you are dissatisfied with the quality of our work, message me and we will provide a refund.

<h2>HELP END RACISM THROUGH FILM!</h2>
<p><strong>We Three Kings</strong> is a collective of three inspirational Afro-Caribbean men who have joined forces to produce a feature film entitled <strong>ON THE OTHER FOOT</strong>. Please read on to find out all about our exciting project and how you can get involved. We already have  £150k but would like to raise a further £100.000 to give this film the attention and visual look it deserves so that is stands up against some of the even bigger budget films.</p>

<p><i>Billy Pitcher </i>is an over protective,  overpowering  father who feels he is always right!  Always pushing his point and his right-wing agenda!  When his daughter starts to date a man who does not agree with any of his views it tips him over the edge.</p>
<p>As a young  millennial woman she is not fazed by her father's antics and eventually convinces him to attend an African church in order for him to at least understand and embrace her new partner's culture. Unfortunately for him he attends on the day of '<i>UMBADEHDEH</i>', a spiritual day where dreams and worst nightmares can come true and he is miraculously transferred into an Afro-Caribbean body. What follows is a comedic and hilarious journey of gut wrenching laughs as he finds out first hand what it's like to be Afro- Caribbean in todays society.</p>
<p>We will be adding exciting cast to the project and you can follow our journey on instagram at</p>

<p>My name is <strong>Fredi Nwaka </strong>and I am an award winning writer, director, producer from the United Kingdom.

<p>My companies are <strong>Are We Dead Yet Ltd</strong> and <strong>Nwaka Productionz</strong>  and I have written, directed and produced independent films for  a number of years including one which is currently being distributed globally called <strong>The Living Dead  </strong><a href=""http://devilworks.eu/projects/are-we-dead-yet/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://devilworks.eu/projects/are-we-dead-yet/</a> and a romantic comedy called <strong>In Spite Of Everything  </strong>which will also soon be released.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Making a feature film is by no means a simple task however I have done it twice now with very small budgets. We already have  £150k but would like to raise a further £100.000 to give this film the attention and visual look it deserves and to give it every chance of being distributed globally and viewed in cinemas as well as on VOD (View On Demand) platforms.

<p>The aim is to start pre-production in September and commence principle photography in October/November or when social distancing regulations permit.  We aim to have the film complete by the end of the year or early 2021.</p>
<p>We have many exciting perks from exclusive tickets to the UK  premiere, short cameos in the film, producer credits to even meeting the cast and crew. </p>

However, the stress doesn’t stop for them when at the baby shower for their coming bundle of joy neither Craig or Sara can outrun the judgement, questions and advice of everyone around them. There’s not a person at the party who isn’t curious to know the one thing the parents-to-be haven’t shared: how their struggle to get pregnant finally came to an end.</p><p> </p><p><i>The happy couple insists it was a miracle, but was it?</i></p><p> </p><p>#MiracleBaby is a short film that blends drama, comedy, and genre together to create an unforgettable film about how far we’re willing to go to live a life that looks perfect, and the pressure put on women to have a baby.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2><u><strong>WHY NOW</strong></u></h2><p><i>(aka a message from the director, Meg Welch)</i></p><p> </p><p>In 2016 I got tired of remaining complacent with how women were treated, and like so many others I decided to stand up. I marched in the Woman’s March. That seed began a current of change and growth in my personal story. But I wasn’t alone. With #MeToo and #TimesUp gaining prominence, the cry for women filmmakers to have a voice in the film industry, and in our society, it’s finally started to feel like the voices of women are being listened to when they speak up, and that people want to hear from them.</p><p> </p><p>When I first read #MiracleBaby it felt like it hit the part of my soul that felt so liberated in our current climate: the part that got angry every time I got a stomach bug and a male coworker would ask if I was pregnant, or that was scoffed at when I admitted I didn’t know if I wanted children – even the part of me that found delight in explaining to two elderly women at the Women’s March what “Feminist AF” meant.</p><p> </p><p>#MiracleBaby lives in what I truly believe: that a person’s value is not defined by their ability or desire to have a baby, and why they make the choice to start a family or not is their business and no one else’s.</p><p> </p><p>What I absolutely love about #MiracleBaby, is that I can tell a story with all of this embedded inside it, but wrapped in a fun coat of quirkiness and genre that will go places a standard drama won’t. And I can’t wait for you to see it.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2><u><strong>WHY WE NEED YOU</strong></u></h2><p>Xander and I are a team of micro-budget filmmakers. We both work day jobs to provide for ourselves and our creative endeavors, and there’s only so much we can contribute to the making of our films and still be able to pay our bills. We are putting countless hours into the making of #MiracleBaby, while we work full time jobs, assemble cast and crew, and do all the prep needed for the shoot. We’ve both committed to financially contributing to the film, but what we can scrape together just isn’t enough.</p><p> </p><p>We need additional funds so that we can get more equipment (to make a visually and aurally better film), provide food for our team during production, business needs (like insurance), props and decorations (this is set at a baby shower after all) and even transportation and storage of said equipment.</p><p> </p><p>There are a lot of moving pieces to making a film, and though our shoots are always humble, we strive to provide the best onset experience we can for our cast and crew, because we value the time and effort they give us and think that providing them with a good meal, comfortable rest areas and nicely maintained, quality equipment is the least we can do as responsible micro-budget filmmakers.</p><p> </p><p>In short, the more money we’re able to raise the better #MiracleBaby will look and sound, and it will help our cast and crew remain happy, safe and healthy.</p><p> </p><p> </p><h2><u><strong>MEET THE FILMMAKERS</strong></u></h2><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1630267266/qdee2ts2puu6jzjkw9cr.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><strong><i>Meg Welch</i></strong></p><p><i>(Director)</i></p><p>Meg has made two no budget features and multiple short films as a writer and director.

However, the stress doesn’t stop for them when at the baby shower for their coming bundle of joy neither Craig or Sara can outrun the judgement, questions and advice of everyone around them. There’s not a person at the party who isn’t curious to know the one thing the parents-to-be haven’t shared: how their struggle to get pregnant finally came to an end. The happy couple insists it was a miracle, but was it? #MiracleBaby is a short film that blends drama, comedy, and genre together to create an unforgettable film about how far we’re willing to go to live a life that looks perfect, and the pressure put on women to have a baby.  WHY NOW(aka a message from the director, Meg Welch) In 2016 I got tired of remaining complacent with how women were treated, and like so many others I decided to stand up. I marched in the Woman’s March. That seed began a current of change and growth in my personal story. But I wasn’t alone. With #MeToo and #TimesUp gaining prominence, the cry for women filmmakers to have a voice in the film industry, and in our society, it’s finally started to feel like the voices of women are being listened to when they speak up, and that people want to hear from them. When I first read #MiracleBaby it felt like it hit the part of my soul that felt so liberated in our current climate: the part that got angry every time I got a stomach bug and a male coworker would ask if I was pregnant, or that was scoffed at when I admitted I didn’t know if I wanted children – even the part of me that found delight in explaining to two elderly women at the Women’s March what “Feminist AF” meant. #MiracleBaby lives in what I truly believe: that a person’s value is not defined by their ability or desire to have a baby, and why they make the choice to start a family or not is their business and no one else’s. What I absolutely love about #MiracleBaby, is that I can tell a story with all of this embedded inside it, but wrapped in a fun coat of quirkiness and genre that will go places a standard drama won’t. And I can’t wait for you to see it.  WHY WE NEED YOUXander and I are a team of micro-budget filmmakers. We both work day jobs to provide for ourselves and our creative endeavors, and there’s only so much we can contribute to the making of our films and still be able to pay our bills. We are putting countless hours into the making of #MiracleBaby, while we work full time jobs, assemble cast and crew, and do all the prep needed for the shoot. We’ve both committed to financially contributing to the film, but what we can scrape together just isn’t enough. We need additional funds so that we can get more equipment (to make a visually and aurally better film), provide food for our team during production, business needs (like insurance), props and decorations (this is set at a baby shower after all) and even transportation and storage of said equipment. There are a lot of moving pieces to making a film, and though our shoots are always humble, we strive to provide the best onset experience we can for our cast and crew, because we value the time and effort they give us and think that providing them with a good meal, comfortable rest areas and nicely maintained, quality equipment is the least we can do as responsible micro-budget filmmakers. In short, the more money we’re able to raise the better #MiracleBaby will look and sound, and it will help our cast and crew remain happy, safe and healthy.  MEET THE FILMMAKERSMeg Welch(Director)Meg has made two no budget features and multiple short films as a writer and director. Working with limited resources has made her a scrappy, adaptable filmmaker who is willing to plunge ahead in order to tell her story. Her joy in filmmaking comes from exploring relationships, genre and the attempt to uncover what truly make us human. Currently, Meg hails from Orange County, California where she lives with her cat Marty (named for Scorsese and McFly) and holds down a day job at a craft company. In addition to filmmaking, Meg is a painter who has had her art in several showcases in LA and Orange County, done multiple art walks, and is an active member of a zoom Shakespeare group that she and her friends began during the pandemic. You can reach Meg on Twitter & Instagram @mrbosslady. Xander Montes(Producer)Originally from Long Beach, California, Xander Montes is an up-and-coming film producer living in Orange County.  Xander is developing the feature film Old Dog, dramedy about a tightly wound man navigating his relationship with his dad and navigating what it could mean to be a father.   He has produced a variety of short films, including Til Death that premiered at the Los Angeles 48 Hour Film Festival (2019).  Xander also holds credits as the 2nd AD position on the 5th season of A Haunting (2012) and a set decorator on a short called A Truth In Silence (2013).  You can find Xander on Instagram at @xfmontes. Helene Kay(Writer)Helene Kay is a comedienne but her IMDB gives off horror movie vibes. She considers herself a triple low threat because of her time doing standup, sketch, and improv. She’s performed all over California mainly in Orange County and Los Angeles, unofficially in awkward social situations. She’s studied writing at Vanguard University, the Groundlings, and UCB. She enjoys working with Megan and Xander and uses writing as a gimmick just to hang out with them.You can find Helene on Instagram at @helenekay. As filmmakers, Meg & Xander value having a team that is diverse and gender inclusive. To meet more of our team please follow our journey on Instagram at @miraclebaby.movie. We will be announcing more of our collaborators there. REWARDSWe think our rewards are pretty rad, and we want to use them to really give you a feeling of being with us on the journey of making #MiracleBaby.

We are hoping that state of the pandemic will not change any local ordinances that would cause us to delay or cancel our shoot, but as we’ve all learned since 2020 we cannot predict how the pandemic is going to roll out. Please cross your fingers and say a little prayer that the shoot will be able to go forward as planned.  SCORE SOME GOOD KARMAIf you’ve gotten this far on the page kudos for sticking to it, and thank you for reading.

We are excited to say that we are finally prepared to give you one of the best Friday the 13th Fan Films and make My Special Boy the best it can be.However, to do that, we need your help. Contributing to this campaign will help finance the best equipment, authentic props, permits to shoot at various locations, and the means to provide our viewers with the highest quality film, in the most efficient and timely manner possible.We are looking to raise $20,000. It is important to note that while we aim at raising this amount and potentially more, Indiegogo takes a significant percentage of all profits. We cannot thank you enough for your support and for becoming an integral member of the My Special Boy family.If you don't see a suitable perk for you, another way to help is to spread the word- follow, like, comment, and share our social media with your friends and family! You can find us on Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube.My Special Boy is in no way afﬁliated to nor represented by Paramount Pictures, New Line Cinema, Platinum Dunes, or any other organization(s) associated with the Friday The 13th franchise.Due to the unavoidable expenses of independent film production, coupled with a desire to do justice to such a prominent franchise, we are compelled to partner with fans to aid in this film's funding.This is a non-profit fan film fostered by inspiration, love, and passion for a franchise that is arguably one of the most successful horror franchises to date. Our goal is to recreate the iconic look of Friday The 13th Part II (1981) while giving it our own fresh take.Thank you so much for taking the time to visit this campaign.

<p><strong>Welcome</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to the IndieGoGo campaign for our film 'BLUE'. Thank you so much for taking the time to have a look. Like many projects on this platform, this film has been a labour of love from the beginning, and we are incredibly excited to begin this journey.</p>
<p>In order to bring our story to life, we are looking to crowdfund the majority of our budget and it would be amazing if you would join us on this journey.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1633202819/xiivlrubjwmcxelgupai.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>BLUE is the story of two fishermen, John Winter, and his son, Charlie, who are struggling to make a living on their small commercial fishing boat. Their relationship is tested and they must both overcome challenges in different ways.</p>

<p><strong>Writer's Statement - 'David Smith'</strong></p>
<p>The screenplay has taken me over a year to complete with many, many coffee shops and a lot of sitting by the sea but I can't explain how happy I am with the current draft - and as a writer this is a rare feeling. Writing this screenplay has been by far the most challenging for me to date, not because of structure or length, but mostly because of the characters journey; it needed to be right, to feel right, and it took a while to get there. Character is one of the most important factors to me in a story, and trying to figure out each individual inside your own head, who they are as a person, what's their struggle, passion, personality, arc is all as important as each other, but having that bouncing around in your thoughts and trying to put that down on to paper can be very draining. Anyone who has ever attempted to write a screenplay, book, story or article knows that writing is a discipline, and I myself have a love/hate relationship with writing, and I know some of you will relate to that.</p>
<p>Over a year of writing and we have a finished draft that I am so proud of, and I honestly cannot wait to begin filming and bring to life the most passionate project I've ever worked on.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1633202877/vjoan6j0b2fpyfriadn3.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>All of the stills in our moodboard will have a huge impact on the final look of the film. One factor we think is important to the visual identity of this film is the aspect ratio in which the film will be captured. If you look at the above images, they all have one thing in common: They are all shot in an aspect ratio of 1.85:1 or similar. This is important as it will allow to us show more within a single frame and capture more information on screen, compared to a more common aspect ratio of 2.35:1.</p>

<p><strong>Pre-Visualation and Story Boards</strong></p>
<p>For some select scenes we have begun the process of putting together some pre-visualisation sequences. This will help us plan and develop our shot list, blocking of scenes, initial editing decisions and allow us to be as prepared as we can for when we come to principle photography, because, as we know, filming doesn't necessarily always go as smoothly as we hope.  </p>

<p>Paul is a wonderfully talented actor, classically trained at drama school and early on in his career was lucky enough to work around the country touring multiple theatre productions. He also has experience within Film and TV. This is where I met Paul and we then went onto make a feature film together, with Paul in the main role. So pleased and engrossed in his performance I actually wrote ‘Blue’ with Paul in mind to play the main protagonist, John. After we shot some test footage it was even clearer to me that Paul was the perfect man for the job. I’m thrilled and excited to be working with him again and cannot wait for you to see what he will bring to this new, challenging role. If this wasn’t challenging enough Paul is also taking on the role as one of our producers, so not only is he giving his all on screen, but off screen also.</p>

Welcome to the IndieGoGo campaign for our film 'BLUE'. Thank you so much for taking the time to have a look. Like many projects on this platform, this film has been a labour of love from the beginning, and we are incredibly excited to begin this journey.

<h3>OUR VAMPIRE STORY</h3>
<p><i>Action - Comedy - Horror - Short film</i></p>
<div>Our Vampire Amila was imprisoned over a century ago by a secret sect of vampire hunting priests.  Only to be rediscovered and shipped to New York. Her wait is finally over, and she is ready to feed again. Mayhem ensues as warehouse workers unwittingly resurrect our beautiful vampire, back from the dead. Becoming her prey, giving her a lifeline of fresh blood. Their only hope is to trap her in the warehouse. The only one who can do it is the last vampire-hunting priest,  with his sidekick Nun and the not so helpful manager of the warehouse. But is it too late? If Amalia escapes the warehouse, all of New York City will become her feeding ground. This action-packed new film directed by 4 time SAG Award Nominee stuntman Roberto Lopez proves nothing more vicious than the wrath of a woman scorned.  Especially when she's a beautiful black &amp; century-old hungry vampire with a new world to discover.</div>

OUR VAMPIRE STORY
Action - Comedy - Horror - Short film
Our Vampire Amila was imprisoned over a century ago by a secret sect of vampire hunting priests.  Only to be rediscovered and shipped to New York. Her wait is finally over, and she is ready to feed again. Mayhem ensues as warehouse workers unwittingly resurrect our beautiful vampire, back from the dead. Becoming her prey, giving her a lifeline of fresh blood. Their only hope is to trap her in the warehouse. The only one who can do it is the last vampire-hunting priest,  with his sidekick Nun and the not so helpful manager of the warehouse. But is it too late? If Amalia escapes the warehouse, all of New York City will become her feeding ground. This action-packed new film directed by 4 time SAG Award Nominee stuntman Roberto Lopez proves nothing more vicious than the wrath of a woman scorned.  Especially when she's a beautiful black & century-old hungry vampire with a new world to discover.
 
 


OUR GOAL

Our goal of $20,000 will make our hard work and dreams come true. Your support will allow us to complete post-production on our film and allow us to release it on October 31, 2021, as intended. 
We are so excited about this film and can't wait for you to see the finished product. 

OUR STRETCH GOAL
Any amount over our initial target goal will be used to enhance our in-person and online Premiere to the utmost so that the experience is an unforgettable one. The Director would love to continue the Vamp Nite storyline, and additional funds will be used to create the next installment if possible. 
 
BUDGET
Your contribution will go towards color correction, sound design, computer-generated special effects, music score, and opening & end credit design.
We are almost certain you will be incredibly impressed with the quality of our work. 
 
RISKS
The great news is that there really is no risk to you because our film is 2/3 done. For those of you who may not be familiar with the actual process of making a film, here's the thick of it: film production is basically broken down into three parts; Pre-Production, where we make all the necessary preparations before the start of filming; Production, where we actually film all the scenes in the script; and Post-Production, where we take everything filmed and edit it, color it, design the sound, add SFX if any, add the music score, and finally add the opening & ending credits. 
Since we've successfully completed the Pre-Production, Production, and editing portion of Post-Production, we are practically steps away from completing Post-Production and having a finished product. 
In many instances with crowd-funding, you get films that are in the early stages of Pre-Production and there is a very high risk that the film will ever be made, let alone premiered. This is totally not the case with us. Our film is almost completed and Will Premiere on October 31st, 2021. What remains to be seen is if we will crawl across the finish line or run across? With your help, we will run across the finish line and enjoy a great Premiere alongside you.

LOGLINE: A nerdy 14-year-old boy suddenly gets the popularity he’s always wanted when a deceitful Artificial Intelligence makes him a social media sensation.
SYNOPSIS: In an alternate 1980’s world, a 14-year-old computer nerd named Beckett O’Connell, is on a quest for popularity by becoming the next MeTubular™ sensation. With many failed attempts to create an audience with his video channel, Beckett becomes more and more desperate for the fame he seeks. One weekend, when Beckett’s parents go out of town and leave him and his older sister Maddie alone for the first time, Beckett and his best friend Jay, tirelessly search the web for answers. Just when they’re about to give up hope, Beckett accidentally stumbles across a site called Viral University and an Artificial Intelligence by the name of Mr. Viral who promises all the likes and views Beckett could ever want. Upon arriving to school the next day, Beckett finds out that his latest video has more than one million views. Beckett is finally becoming the Internet star he’s always wanted to be and rapidly gaining popularity among his peers. But he soon finds out that fame comes at a great cost and Mr. Viral is playing him like a puppet to win his soul. Just as Beckett is about to lose the friendships of those he cares for the most, he discovers Mr. Viral’s plan and realizes he is the one behind all the most famous MeTubular™ kid phenom influencers. With his wit, and with extreme caution, Beckett tries to figure out how to stop and destroy Mr. Viral and seeks out help from an underground (once famous) gamer by the name of “Samurai.” With the strategy of Samurai and his own tech intelligence, Beckett and his friends end up in an epic battle with Mr. Viral and his other Internet puppets to save his friends and ultimately win his soul back.////CHECK OUT OUR TEASER//// ////THE PERKS////CHECK OUT SOME OF OUR FAVORITE 80'S MOVIES FOR THE PERK PACKAGES!DID YOU KNOW that the movie TRON was inspired by the Atari game PONG?

<h3>The Story</h3>
<p><i>Roger is the worst husband. Ever. Best friends Beverly and Suzette decide the most logical solution is that, well, Roger must die.</i></p>
<p>Hello and thank you for dropping by our indiegogo campaign!  Roger Must Die tells the story of a scorned wife who goes to desperate measures to regain control of her life. We believe in the strength of women. Our protagonist, Beverly, must find her inner strength to raise herself out of her circumstance. While we <i>don't</i> condone murder, we <i>do </i>believe in raising women up, which is why we are attempting to make this film with an <u>entirely female crew</u>. </p>

Most importantly - we are excited to bring the film everywhere through festivals and other contests. If You’d like to see what we have achieved since the start of the campaign, scroll down to our timeline!   Having completed the thrilling stage of principal photography, we are now raising funds to polish up our film. Our primary goal is to prepare the production for entering the film festivals and delivering it to our backers along with their rewards.What do we mean by ‘polishing up’? This includes all the previously mentioned elements of post-production: VFX, music, sound design, and colour grading. Some scenes and sequences of the film need additional audio or video, thus the funds will go towards facilitating safe, COVID-compliant recording sessions. We are looking forward to finalise all of the work as we progress with the campaign - and we invite You to follow us and be part of that progress!Furthermore, we want to be able to continue our commitment and remain fair toward everybody who contributed to the making of this film, but had to incur unexpected COVID-19 related expenses.A portion of the funds will be used to facilitate the Indiegogo fee as well as submission fees to different festivals. You can read about the latter one further down below! We had an opportunity to work with two incredible, rising stars of the Irish acting scene. It's thanks to them we see the potential of the story; they help to complete the mood of the whole piece. And if You are worried we made them do all the work during such difficult times for free - that's not the case! Get to know them and see how they looked like on our set: Rachel Browne (as Victoria) was raised in Dublin and Essex. Her career started with an invitation to Morley College Theatre company, then Reboot Theatre company for performing in The Southwark Bunker Theatre. She trained in Identity School of Acting and signed to their agency. Featured in the New York Times for her work in The Heptameron (2020) in Italy, Rachel is building a strong presence on the screen in other short films like Flicker (2020) and Manhunt (2020). Francis Mezza (as Ciaran) is a Belfast-born actor who trained at The Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama. His acclaimed theatre performances across United Kingdom and Ireland includes The Absence of Women (Lyric Theatre, Belfast), Macbeth (Rough Magic Theatre), The Doppler Effect (The Belfast Ensemble), The Ferryman (Sonia Friedman Productions/Royal Court) and Cityscapes (Pintsized). His on screen presence includes Derry Girls (Hat Trick Productions/Channel 4). We are proud of everybody who worked on this film and put so much effort to make it happen in a safe environment. You can read about the backbone of the crew below! This international and multiculutral bunch can tell You about their experience on this film and other project they worked on. Also, check how they hid behind the masks on our set: Writer and Director - Timotej Bača“I originally pitched the film back in November 2019 and if you had told me then what was going to happen in the following months and years… We had originally planned on shooting in February 2020 until what happened, happened. When restrictions eased up I called everyone up, rewrote the script and turned my entire house inside out to timewarp it into 1990s Belfast, to have full control over the safety. Over the months of the production of this film, one could feel the pressure of history happening to us as we lived our ordinary lives, I hope this film reflects that.”Alongside my short film work as an independent filmmaker I also lecture at Central Saint Martins College of Art (CSM) and work as a freelance director in advertising. Producer and 1st AD - Jan Jakub Osiński“This project posed a challenge when it came to undertaking decisions. It was a real test to how I’m planning and producing films on every stage. Despite the hardships, we were able to achieve wonders on such a small budget; we have meticulously recreated the look and the atmosphere of the ‘90s Belfast and can enhance it even more. With our eyes on the upcoming festivals, I’m excited to engage the audience and give them a valuable film for the hard times we currently go through.”As a graduate of UAL, currently studying journalism at UWr, I’ve undertaken production specialism and work as a producer and assistant director. I’ve taken part in a number of independent productions ranging from short drama and documentary forms, television series and music videos; I’m a laureate of the Xuria competition 2019. Producer and Sound Recordist - Ashling Sugrue“Despite having worked extensively with this crew before, bringing ‘Another Day in 98’ to life was still a real challenge for all of us, and I’m very glad to have been along for the ride. I’m excited to see the project completed and out in the world.”I’m an Irish-Kyrgyz filmmaker with my toes dipped in many production pies! I have experience in producing international shorts, have self-shot a documentary in Kyrgyzstan, won screenwriting awards at ScreenCraft and the Atlanta Film Festival, and I am now working as a content producer for luxury fashion brands. I’m looking forward to seeing where ‘Another Day in ‘98’ will go from here! Zachary Chia - Director of Photography“The production of 'Another Day in ‘98' saw quite a number of changes and obstacles to work around from the early stages of drafting up until the edit due to many unforeseen circumstances. Despite having to work within many limitations (especially the tight headspace of the attic, which was one of the locations), it was an awesome experience making this film with a team that pushed on and gave their best from start to finish.”I’m a graduate of UAL. I currently work as a camera and lighting crew. Some of my recent projects include “To Have Ham Over Your Eyes”, which was an award nominee at the London Short Film Fest 2020, and “The Nose” which was also directed by Timotej! Krystian Graczyk - Editor“'Another Day in ‘98' is a challenging project given the current pandemic situation. We have managed to pull it together and film in both London and Belfast while suffering from cancellations and lengthy postpones. Likewise to the rest of the film industry, I had to implement new ways of workflow based on remote editing. Nevertheless, thanks to close support from the producer, director, and the edit team, we are crafting something special.”I graduated UAL having specialised in post production. I’ve worked on many different projects such as Starbucks + Sign2Sing, RCP charity as well as films entering multiple festivals and film events with showings at the Nightpiece Film Festival 2019 (Edinburgh Festival Fringe) and Kinofilm, Manchester International Short Film & Animation Festival 2020. Currently I’m Media Manager at London based Connected Pictures. We want our work to be seen! We want our film to be reviewed, hear everybody’s voice, be able to present our talents to the wider audience. If You choose to, we would be proud to show Your name in the credits as well. And is there a better way to do it all if not the festivals?The story being set in Belfast with the historical background of the Good Friday Agreement means we want to concentrate on the audiences that can relate to this groundbreaking time in 1998. We are therefore preparing to apply for the Irish and UK based film festivals, as we believe we have a strong film that will grab attention! It doesn't mean we will stop there - we want to venture out internationally as well! We offer a range of rewards, a way to say “Thank You!” for Your support! Please, find a full description of the rewards we provide, below:●     Digital limited film access - Be able to stream the final film for the whole December of 2021. You will be given a special password that would remain active for the duration of the period  allowing You for unlimited rewatches!●     Social media shoutout - Your name will be out there on our Instagram, forever! Write Yourself down in the digital history and show Your friends and family You care about independent culture!●     Film credit - Your name will be engraved on the end credits of the film. Get Yourself shown to audiences at home and festivals and become part of the final film until the end of time!●     Postcard from Belfast - We want to send You a personalised letter from Belfast. We have prepared the original design of our postcard and would love to get it to You! The postcard was designed by Szymon Osiński.●     Director’s commentary/BTS - Be able to stream and download a special video from our director talking about the creative process, drama and bloopers that we all witnessed on the set.

It’s a unique piece carefully constructed by Marco Antonio Grubben.●     Signed script with notes - Receive the full script of the original film with handwritten notes added by the director detailing what happened with particular scenes, how they evolved and how they were shot. Get to know the almost 30 page long story of Victoria and Ciaran in full extent!●     Assistant Producer title - You will be credited as an Assistant Producer, at the top of the end credits, along the rest of the crew. It’s an honour for us to have You on board!●     Executive Producer title - You will be credited as an Assistant Producer at the very top of the end credits. You are a true V.I.P in our crew and Your name should be on the highest spot! The original design of the postcard by Szymon Osiński! We are glad to state that supporting our project does not bear any risks of the production failing. We want to polish up our film and make it better than if we had tried continuing on our own.Depending on Your support, we might have to challenge ourselves in limiting the spectrum of film festivals which we can attend. We aim for the film to be finished by the end of April 2021, which would allow us to submit to festivals closing their applications around this time. Our experience of the past months shows that remote editing and work related to the transfer of large amounts of data is excruciatingly slow. In such cases, we will keep in touch with You via email and Instagram, and inform You officially about any significant delays or changes. Thank you for Your support!If You want to help us by sharing our campaign, feel free to do so! We know these are hard times for everybody and sometimes every penny counts.Check our Instagram for more!  All the stills attached to this page do not have to reflect the final look of the film.",25.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Honestly? You probably have far better things to be spending your money on, and let's face it, there are a ton of similar projects out there asking for money.</p>
<p>Putting that aside though, while this may be our first crowdfunder, it isn't our first film. We've been making fanfilms for well over a decade, we've even gotten moderately competent (disclaimer; that word might not mean what I think it means). We're not making big budget, glossy, professional films, but we are trying to tell fun, entertaining stories set in the Star Trek universe. And I think this new story is no exception.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579047061/eanm1hnmdzzrcpwmlnc1.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>So why do we need your help now? The simple fact is, these things are expensive. I think we've done a pretty good job of getting the most out of our shoestring budgets and the kindness of friends so far. But we'd like to do better.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579083861/lksbl91uhjqdcfpxgpne.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Echoes will require a lot of challenging exterior shooting, some new costuming, and location hire. Food, transport, expendables, these are all things that add up quickly and drain what little budget we have. We're not looking for people to cover all our costs, but even a small donation would be of immense help in stretching our resources out, and ensuring we can produce as professional and polished a film as possible. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1579084800/a1vlxm67rwtskne8wjgh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>So should you support us? Only you can answer that question. But if you do, you can be certain you'll receive our gratitude and a (hopefully) entertaining film.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>So what exactly are we asking for?</h3>
<p>In short:</p>
<ul>
<li>Travel expenses. </li>
<li>Room hire.</li>
<li>Food. Actors and crew can get a little grumpy if you don’t feed them. We don’t want that.</li>
<li>Props and costumes. Most of this is in place already, but we still have to provide wardrobe and props for our antagonists, the Venkari Solidarity. We don't anticipate these being expensive, but we will need to purchase materials for them.</li>
<li>Make up. We don't anticipate any complex make up, but the cost of supplies even for the most basic makeup quickly piles up.</li>
<li>Associated consumables (such as batteries).</li>
<li>Post-production expenses.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>

<p>At present, we're aiming to have the film completed by April of 2021, but it's always possible that various roadblocks could crop up to delay that. However, we are determined to produce and complete this film and I think our track record to date shows that we are likely to keep that promise. Since 2003 we have produced a dozen films ranging from 5 minutes to 47 in length (with two more coming this year). While these films are certainly amateur in presentation, they also demonstrate continual evidence of our growth as filmmakers and storytellers, and we're confident Echoes will continue that trend. You can find all our previous films on YouTube, should you care to review them.</p>

</div></div>","The Story

Generations collide! Lost in a time and place not her own, and thrown into the middle of a conflict that shouldn’t involve her, Lieutenant Sofia Karras just wants to go home. But is home still waiting?
Directed by Laura Barnes, Echoes will feature the following.

Amira Kremers as Sofia Karras
Shona Smith as Alison Fitzpatrick
Marley Hunter as Jer-Ahn
Steve Hammond as Magon
Mat Hodson as Terak
Nick Cook as Daniel Hunter
Hilary Roberts as Caitlyn Frances
Lucita Faria-Cook as Yanis Caed
David M. Reid as Lucas Jansen
Euan Smith as Jason Raines
Mel Graham as Joanna Clayton
Stephen Curtis as Okala Kalim 
Alan Johnston as Rendar
Bob Bruce as Kaine
Donna Mackintosh as Altera
Gavin Beckers as Nash

In addition, Samuel Cockings of Trekyards fame, has kindly agreed to provide visual effects, and you can expect to see his usual high standard of work throughout the film.
Why support us?

Honestly? You probably have far better things to be spending your money on, and let's face it, there are a ton of similar projects out there asking for money.
Putting that aside though, while this may be our first crowdfunder, it isn't our first film. We've been making fanfilms for well over a decade, we've even gotten moderately competent (disclaimer; that word might not mean what I think it means). We're not making big budget, glossy, professional films, but we are trying to tell fun, entertaining stories set in the Star Trek universe. And I think this new story is no exception.

So why do we need your help now? The simple fact is, these things are expensive. I think we've done a pretty good job of getting the most out of our shoestring budgets and the kindness of friends so far. But we'd like to do better.

Echoes will require a lot of challenging exterior shooting, some new costuming, and location hire. Food, transport, expendables, these are all things that add up quickly and drain what little budget we have. We're not looking for people to cover all our costs, but even a small donation would be of immense help in stretching our resources out, and ensuring we can produce as professional and polished a film as possible. 

So should you support us? Only you can answer that question. But if you do, you can be certain you'll receive our gratitude and a (hopefully) entertaining film.

So what exactly are we asking for?
In short:

Travel expenses. 
Room hire.
Food. Actors and crew can get a little grumpy if you don’t feed them. We don’t want that.
Props and costumes. Most of this is in place already, but we still have to provide wardrobe and props for our antagonists, the Venkari Solidarity. We don't anticipate these being expensive, but we will need to purchase materials for them.
Make up. We don't anticipate any complex make up, but the cost of supplies even for the most basic makeup quickly piles up.
Associated consumables (such as batteries).
Post-production expenses.


Risks & Challenges

At present, we're aiming to have the film completed by April of 2021, but it's always possible that various roadblocks could crop up to delay that. However, we are determined to produce and complete this film and I think our track record to date shows that we are likely to keep that promise. Since 2003 we have produced a dozen films ranging from 5 minutes to 47 in length (with two more coming this year). While these films are certainly amateur in presentation, they also demonstrate continual evidence of our growth as filmmakers and storytellers, and we're confident Echoes will continue that trend. You can find all our previous films on YouTube, should you care to review them.

<br/><strong>THE DIRECT</strong><strong>OR ANTHONY PISENO</strong>
</h3>
<p>A little about me, I grew up in Fresno, California. My father introduced me to his favorite films at a young age. I grew up with Ray Harryhausen films like “The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad”, “Clash of the Titans”, and “Jason and the Argonauts”. He also introduced me to Godzilla and Star Wars. I fell in love with monsters and eventually horror. Fast forward to three years ago and the filmmaker in me was finally born with a short film titled “the box” since I have evolved into a better and more complete filmmaker. In my short career I won a Best Sci-Fi film from The Blood Horror Festival with my film “Prey by Night” and won 1st place in the 20th GERM festival with my film “It Calls”.</p>

<h3>About the Film</h3>
<p><strong><i>To Meet the Faces You Meet</i></strong> is a feature-length independent science fiction film based on the 1972 underground comic <strong><i>Fever Dreams</i></strong> written by <strong>Jan Strnad</strong> (DC Comics, Disney, <i>Heavy Metal</i>) and illustrated by <strong>Richard Corben</strong> (<i>Heavy Metal</i>, <i>Fantagor</i>, Dark Horse Comics). The film is animated and directed by <strong>J. Allen Williams</strong> (<i>Darkstar: The Interactive Movie</i>, <i>Everything</i>), who co-wrote the screenplay with Strnad.</p>
<p><i>To Meet the Faces You Meet</i> will star the talented <strong>Samuel Hunt</strong> (<i>Chicago P.D.</i>, <i>Empire</i>, <i>Unbroken: Path to Redemption</i>) as its protagonist Friz and <strong>Patton Oswalt</strong> (<i>The King of Queens</i>, <i>Young Adult</i>, <i>Ratatouille</i>) as Friz's symbiotic robot MEAD, whose parts have already been recorded.  The antagonist chasing our heroes across the universe is none other than the incomparable <strong>Robert Picardo</strong> (<i>Star Trek: Voyager</i>, the <i>Stargate</i> franchise, <i>The Orville</i>) as the villainous Admiral Gillette. The film will also feature the iconic voice of <strong>Patrick Warburton</strong> (<i>Seinfeld</i>, <i>The Tick</i>, <i>Family Guy</i>) as Timmy the Wunderbot, a 300 foot tall toy unleashed on the bad guys.</p>

<h3>Why We Need Your Help</h3>
<p>After nearly four years of work, the entire 94-minute feature film is nearly complete, including animated plates, editing, music score, and sound effects. In fact, just one crucial final stage remains — filming the live-action sequences and adding the performances of our stellar cast.</p>
<p>In order to finish the film and make it the very best it can be, we could use your help. The purpose of this IndieGoGo campaign is to raise crucial funds for additional actors, their airfare, hotels and food (craft services) while they are in our care during the shoot, SAG fees, studio space, set construction, lighting, sound, and other ancillary production needs.</p>
<p>Thanks to a Kickstarter event earlier this year, we were able to raise enough funds to hire the actors <strong>Samuel Hunt</strong>, <strong>Patrick Warburton</strong>, and <strong>Robert Picardo</strong>, in addition to a few others (see our CAST video).  We were able to add more actors than anticipated by matching the KS funds with our own studio funds, but by doing so the costs for production went a lot higher than anticipated — travel, lodging, food, SAG fees, etc increased exponentially with each “name” actor we added to the cast.</p>
<p>We've set a minimum goal of $10,000 for this campaign to add to our funds already raised, but that's just it—the minimum. Every dollar beyond this goal will go to making the production look and sound even better by teaming up with potential backers like you! </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><i>To Meet the Faces You Meet</i> will be made regardless of the outcome of this fundraiser. The purpose of this campaign is to raise the additional funds needed to complete the film so that we can make the final product better than ever without driving the studio into more debt and slowing their ability to complete the film quickly.  Remember, 90% of the film is complete after nearly four years of production (check out our videos), we just need a bit of help over the finish line to make the film BETTER FASTER.  Parallax Studio has funded this first 90% including all of the CGI and animations, Patton Oswalt’s fee, studio fees in Hollywood — everything done to date. Covid-19 has really hurt the film industry, especially independent studios like ours.  We are ready and able to finish <i>TMtFYM</i> regardless, but your help will make a huge difference — a game changer.  We want to be poised to release our film through a major distribution network when Covid finally recedes and the film/theater industries are ready for content.</p>

The purpose of this campaign is to raise the additional funds needed to complete the film so that we can make the final product better than ever without driving the studio into more debt and slowing their ability to complete the film quickly.  Remember, 90% of the film is complete after nearly four years of production (check out our videos), we just need a bit of help over the finish line to make the film BETTER FASTER.  Parallax Studio has funded this first 90% including all of the CGI and animations, Patton Oswalt’s fee, studio fees in Hollywood — everything done to date. Covid-19 has really hurt the film industry, especially independent studios like ours.  We are ready and able to finish TMtFYM regardless, but your help will make a huge difference — a game changer.  We want to be poised to release our film through a major distribution network when Covid finally recedes and the film/theater industries are ready for content.


Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't afford to back our campaign (understandable, given the current state of the world), please consider spreading the word about our film on social media and IRL. We're grateful for every Like, Share, Re-Tweet, and Mention! Anything you do to get MEAD onto screens everywhere will be appreciated and acknowledged. THANK YOU!",3.0,2,"1 Campaign

<h2>The Film</h2>
<p>Hello! I'm Charles Socarides, writer/director of <i>Ray</i>.</p>
<p>I'm sure you've read the news: <strong>opioid overdoses in the U.S. have skyrocketed during the Covid-19 pandemic. </strong>Addiction has always been a disease that feeds on isolation, hopelessness and shame, so it is no surprise that some people are hurting worse than ever. </p>
<p><i>Ray</i> is a 12-minute drama that tells the story of Quinn, a young man who has lost his twin brother to a heroin overdose. At his brother's funeral he meets Daphne, a woman tortured by her own substance use disorder, who has the power to destroy or save them both.</p>
<p>Sound interesting? I hope so... because, at this critical moment, we need stories that shed light on the shared humanity of<i> </i>this deadly disease.</p>
<p><i>Ray </i>has been my personal passion project for three years, and the GOOD NEWS is that we were able to wrap production in the height of the pandemic and the film looks amazing (see above)!</p>
<p>Our stars gave killer performances, our camera team knocked it out of the park and the production design was more vivid than I could have imagined. But now for a dose of reality: </p>
<p><strong>We need your help to finish this thing. </strong></p>
<p>Team RAY is seeking <i>one final push</i> to close the gap on post-production costs.</p>

<p>It is true what they say about filmmaking: ""When you're done filming, congratulations, you're 50% of the way there."" (I think it's actually closer to 40%!).</p>
<p>Post-production is every bit as essential to building the world of the film as finding the right location or casting the perfect actor.</p>
<p>We are seeking $6,500 to help cover these costs. Here's the breakdown:</p>
<p><u>Editing</u>: Pacing is everything in this claustrophobic, ultimately explosive story. We need a fantastic editing team to capture this rhythm and deliver the finished film. ~$1,750</p>
<p><u>Sound Design and Mix</u>: Quinn's inner world will be crafted from memories that he can't get out of his head. Sound is our most important tool in establishing this mood. Also, without a quality mix, the dialogue of the film would be uneven or lost. ~ $2,000</p>
<p><u>Color Correction and Grading</u>: <i>Ray </i>was shot on the fancy Mini LF. Large Format (LF) is able to capture an amazing amount of detail. To bring this out - and at the same time achieve the textured, filmic look we're after - we are working with top-of-the-line colorists. ~ $1,500</p>
<p><u>Song Licensing</u>: We have found the perfect music for the film and couldn't be more thrilled. We'd love to compensate those composers and cover small copyright fees. ~$500</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>You can’t choose your family, but you can support what team to support. And oh boy, James made the wrong choice tonight…</strong></p>
<p>Bragoro <i>(Puberty) </i>will be a Comedy, Drama short film about a teenager receiving an ad-lib education about his roots whilst trying to watch a football match between England and Ghana.</p>
<p>The story will follow James, a 14 year old second generation immigrant. Born in Hammersmith, West London, Bred in Kennington, South London, as he prepares to support his home country in the World Cup Semi Final whilst aided by his school friends who are also supporting England.</p>
<p>However, conflict arises as James' Mother and Father host a Tanzania/Ghana fusion night to watch the match and his whole family are supporting the other team in the Semi Final, Ghana. Why? Because his Mum and Aunty are from Ghana, born and raised and whilst his Dad and Uncle are from Tanzania, they want Ghana to win because an African country has never been to the World Cup Final. </p>
<p>The story takes a turn though as friction bubbles to the surface, and James says something to his Aunty that you never say to your elders in Ghana. Thus kicks off the time ye olde tradition of Cultural Bragoro, which translates to Cultural Puberty. Where a young person goes through a maturing of sorts in their cultural understanding. Of their heritage and roots. </p>
</div><div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Why This? Who is this for? Why Now?</strong></p>
<p>I believe this is a story that was a long time coming for me personally as I was once James. Where I didn't really see the importance of my heritage or roots, why I should even care and that since I was born and bred in the UK, it didn't really matter because I wasn't ""from"" my motherland or fatherland (for me this was Tanzania and Ghana respectfully). But that wasn't true at all, of course it was important. It was my heritage, it's where I'm from. And honestly, I wish I'd seen a film like this when I was younger. </p>
<p>This is the type of thing that every second generation immigrant in this country thinks about. Where one or both your parents were born overseas and migrated to the UK (in this instance), then you were subsequently born in the UK. So this story is for any second generation immigrant that feels confused about your identity, and where you think you're from. Also specifically, this is for anybody of the African diaspora. Diaspora meaning a scattered population whose origin lies in a separate geographic locale. Since I've seen a lot of films about second generation immigrants going on a journey to find themselves and their identity but not a lot of them were from the African perspective that was specific to say me. So it's just something that caught my eye and what I always wanted to show on-screen.</p>
<p>And they are a lot of reasons why now is the best time to tell this story. I've got to get the B word out of the way, so Brexit is a big reason why this story is so important now, more than ever. Also how timely it is from a football sense because not only are we getting into World Cup season next year but we’re hot off “It’s coming home season” from the Euros. It's also important identity is tackled in this film given the racial abuse Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka received in the final that was prominently from this country. Finally, this short is something I wanted to write and direct in memory of my late Babu and Grandma. They've given me every bit of strength I have in life and I want to thank them by not only showing my appreciation but also give a spotlight to the countries they were born and raised, Tanzania and Ghana. </p>

After escaping from a severely abusive relationship at 19-years-old and publicly sharing her experiences in 2016, a South Asian woman reflects on her 5 year journey of isolation from her faith-based community, lingering trauma from her ex-partner, navigating the aftermath of using her voice and self-healing to build a new life.
Produced and created by two South Asian women, 'This Is My Proof' is a documentary centring the experience and journey of navigating community isolation after coming forward about assault and domestic abuse.
This film will be used as a tool and resource for domestic violence education. It will contribute to the Violence Against Women movement, and provide representation on what it means to experience intimate-partner violence as a marginalized individual. Our goal is to submit the documentary to film festivals and distribute it  through platforms that can reach a wider audience and community spaces.
Together, we can continue the fight towards ending violence against women.

Approximately every six days, a woman in Canada is killed by her intimate partner.
In 2016, Serena shared her experiences for the very first time online in the form of a blog post. In under two weeks, 34,000 people had viewed and read it. Her inbox was flooded with hundreds of messages from women who were, and may still be, experiencing violence.
She later went on to speak on national TV and panels about her experiences, in hopes of dismantling stereotypes of domestic abuse, assault and gender-based violence. 
The idea for this documentary came naturally when Serena was reflecting on how she could make an impact by sharing a deeper layer of her experiences with domestic violence, particularly about the aftermath of coming forward with her truth.
Now, she recognizes the opportunity to reflect on what the past 5 years of healing, coping and rebuilding have been like, specifically as a Muslim woman. She's ready to open up the doors to details she's never shared before and begin a whole new conversation.

<b>The Future of THE KEEP?</b><p> </p>If we go way beyond our goal, we'll start to look further into the soundtrack rights with the Tangerine Dream estate, whilst focusing on a long term movement for the film itself, helping to present a serious case for the importance of THE KEEP and preserving its legacy.

<p>We have already undertaken a great deal of effort to document an unknown period in Michael Mann's career.

<br/><br/> </div></div>","*For the French version of the campaign video, please click here*https://vimeo.com/146695791Oscar-nominated director Michael Mann helped redefine the possibilities of commercial film and his enduring influence can be seen in the array of filmmakers whose work, in very different ways, owes him a debt - from Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight) and Nicolas Winding Refn (Drive) to Louis Letterier (The Incredible Hulk) Ben Affleck (The Town) and Ben Wheatley (High-Rise). 
 Michael Mann’s THE KEEP, released in 1983 and based on fantasy author F.Paul Wilson’s best-selling novel was a film that was never fully realised. 
 Drawing from Bruno Bettelheim’s text The Uses of Enchantment and set in North East Romania at the height of the Nazi’s power, THE KEEP was conceived by Mann to be an epic adult fairytale for our times.  Starring Oscar-Nominated Sir Ian Mckellen, Gabriel Byrne, Scott Glenn & Jurgen Prochnow, Mann’s notion of crafting something completely unique was way ahead of its time. The material struck a cord with Mann who approached it with the same exhaustive research that he had applied to his crime epics.Inspired by the silent German & Danish film works of F. W Murnau, Paul Wegener & Carl Theodor Dreyer, Mann created a phantasmagoria of white-washed exteriors separated by a bridge into the deep blacks and greys of THE KEEP interior. Two polar opposites that created the perfect duality to set up the story.

 Mann’s ambition was such that he not only had three-time Academy Award-winning production designer John Box (Lawrence of Arabia/Dr Zhivago) on board to perfectly realise the sets, but enigmatic FX artist Wally Veevers (2001:A Space Odyssey) to create the complex practical effects, along with an often chaotic revolving door of many established and upcoming artists across all creative fields, including experimental musician & composer Laurie Anderson, comic book auteur Enki Bilal, electronic pioneers Tangerine Dream and visionary portrait photographer Art Kane in a creative milieu of unique proportions. The resulting film created a very influential fabric of vision and sound for filmmakers around the world.

This sequence remains one of the memorable scenes in the Theatrical version of the film.  The soundtrack by Tangerine Dream became equally memorable, taking composer Howard Blake's world-renowned theme 'Walking in the Air ' from the much loved children's animation short, the Oscar-nominated The Snowman (1982); and turned it into an all-encompassing  mix of music composition and sound design that wrapped itself around THE KEEP's mysterious, supernatural core.

“Movies aren’t finished. They’re abandoned.”—David Fincher (Director - The Social Network, Seven, Alien 3)Despite Wally Veevers' untimely death in Feb of 1983, marking a major blow to an already difficult production, filming continued, costs escalated and schedules ballooned to a point where much of the footage remained left out of the theatrical version of THE KEEP upon its Xmas release in the U.S. This lost footage equates to over one hour’s worth of story, dialogue, key plot points and some instances where whole scenes and effects had been severly cut against Mann's wishes.A tough learning experience for Michael & the crew, what we’ve been left with is a visionary filmmaker pushing the boundaries of cinema that made a huge impact on audiences around the world who were lucky enough to see it either on its initial release, home video in the 80's, or most recently, digital streaming.  

Shot over five years in six countries across two continents, A World War II Fairytale is a completely unique opportunity for you to learn more about one of Michael Mann's most wildly inventive, ambitious and unknown periods in his career. The production combines historian Stephane Piter's twenty-plus year archive on THE KEEP with that of hundreds of new interviews with cast, crew, critics & filmmakers. The documentary also unearths a wealth of material which allows a much deeper look into the filmmaking process and Michael Mann's working methods.''I had a look at your website. You have done a lot of solid work here and your collection of THE KEEP materials is impressive. I'm glad that this early work of mine has inspired you so much and I appreciate your continued passion'' ~ MICHAEL MANN on producer Stephane Piter's initial drive behind the project. 
Michael Mann will be remembered as one of the most important and influential voices in American Cinema inspiring a whole new generation of filmmakers. Along with his peers Ridley Scott, Martin Scorsese & Francis Ford Coppola, Mann has pushed the art of storytelling and his body of work will remain a vital piece of modern film history in many years to come.THE KEEP is the perfect portal with which to tell that story. The 1980's were a formatively fertile time for Michael Mann in one of the most experimental and exciting decades of his career working in the studio system. 
Confronting the harsh realities of the filmmaking process A World War II Fairytale will present to you, for the first time, director Michael Mann's enthusiasm for the material, what he wanted to say with THE KEEP and why it remains one of the most personal projects of his career.

 Director/Producer Stewart Buck
As a result of an intensive study in film over the past ten years, Buck has built up relationships with some of the most respected directors, writers and artists of the last 30 years through his knowledge of film and film history, including the multi-award winning British artist Philip Ridley (The Reflecting Skin) and Oscar-winning political filmmaker Michael Wadleigh (Woodstock).
With Buck's feature length directorial debut A World War II Fairytale, the director aims to break away from the more traditional retrospective into territory explored in George Hickenlooper's Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse & Frank Pavichs' recent documentary on Alejandro Jodorowsky's unrealised adaptation of Frank Herbert's Dune.

 The movie & soundtrackSince we started this journey, it was to be expected that we'd receive numerous questions around any future release of THE KEEP movie and/or soundtrack.

<h3>What's this film about?</h3>
<p>The films follows Jackie <i>(Ken May)</i>, a morgue worker in a small town. Jackie's personal life, is one of chaos and violence! With more than half of the bodies coming through the morgue, is by his helping hand. This killer may think he's going about his murders under the radar, but a small town disgraced Detective <i>(Shane Ryan)</i> is hot on his trail.</p>
<ul>
<li>Shot in somewhat experimental way, this SPLATTER flick is shown uncut, uncensored and entirely too graphic to be given to a distribution and wait for a return... so we are doing it our OWN way, and funding the next project ourselves!</li>
<li>Entering the indie horror world, we are met with the same slasher and remake. We hope this hits more of an original take on the slasher flick genre!</li>
<li>Not to mention, this film is <u><i>done</i></u>... so don't picture what this film can be like... the stills, trailer and final advertisement is <i>all</i> from a <i>finished</i> film ready to be shipped out once the discs arrive!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Starring:</strong> <strong>Ken May</strong> <i>(Robowoman, Tales for the Campfire 3)</i> as the killer and morgue worker, Jackie! <strong>Shane Ryan</strong> <i>(Samurai Cop 2, Choke)</i> as the Detective, close to being fired and at the end of his mental rope! <strong>Doug Waugh</strong> <i>(Grosshouse, Death Park: The End)</i> as the comedic lift and co-worker to Jackie! <strong>Rebecca Vanguard</strong> <i>(Flesh Eater X) </i>playing the grieving daughter being lured into the killers web!

<h3>IF YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED...</h3>
<p>This slasher flick is finished, and we are finally unveiling it to the world. If you have NOT noticed, the film is also... COMPLETE!! So the only waiting around is for the indiegogo to give us your money... and then us taking that money and making the discs to then send to you! So, what <u><strong>DON'T</strong></u> you have to worry about?</p>
<ul>
<li>The start, filming &amp; editing of an entire film... we already did that!</li>
<li>Waiting to see what this film will be like or who will it feature!</li>
<li>Will I get my package ever?! (let me reassure you below!)</li>
</ul>
<p>I have directed over 10+ short films, 2 feature films and EVERYONE has finished, made it onto DVD &amp; Blu-ray and OUT to the buyers and supporters of that film... Sure, they're delays but with your support on indiegogo, it makes it EASIER... to inform supporters of any issues or problems that may delay projects, but THE FILM IS DONE... the only waiting is for the discs to arrive and us shipping that disc to you!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What are we giving you? What are we doing next?</h3>
<p>We are simply trying to make the <strong>NEXT</strong> film so, we decided to give an opportunity to get your hands on this film and let it be a launching pad to our next big film... IF we reach our goal. </p>
<ul>
<li>We are aiming for <strong>$15,000 </strong>for our next project... and IF all DVD &amp; Blu-rays sell out, we'll more than <u><i>double</i></u> our asking goal! </li>
<li>
<i>You, want a <strong>SIGNED</strong> release?</i> we got it, if you order from this Indiegogo! <i>You want a prop from the film?</i> we saved them for you! Trying to get your name on the <strong>NEXT</strong> project... <i>maybe, we'll see!</i>

<li>The funds will be going <i>(obviously)</i> to manufacture the DVDs, Blurays, Posters &amp; then to our new project!!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Are there risks?</h3>
<p><i><strong>Are there risks?</strong></i> not entirely outside; we wanna jump into the next film and aim to shock people with this film! And keep them in awe with the second, and <strong>YOU</strong> can help out! Regardless, films take a while to make, and we didn't wanna wait too long to make it, so help us out by pre-ordering this horror film, buy props, share indiegogo around and help us reach the goal... Nay, help us go past our goal, and the more money coming in, the bigger we can make the next! $15K, is the MINIMUM goal to make it... imagine if we have $50K...Let's make it happen!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p><strong>SHARE IT!</strong> A lot of support that comes into indiegogos, and people reaching there goal is based on support and usually they have a name that brings that! A lot of our films are underground and reaching a <i>niche</i> audience with the brutality and graphic content... Now, we are trying to reach a wider audience and we <strong>NEED</strong> all the help we can get!</p>

We are aiming for $15,000 for our next project... and IF all DVD & Blu-rays sell out, we'll more than double our asking goal! 

You, want a SIGNED release? we got it, if you order from this Indiegogo! You want a prop from the film? we saved them for you! Trying to get your name on the NEXT project... maybe, we'll see!

The funds will be going (obviously) to manufacture the DVDs, Blurays, Posters & then to our new project!!


Are there risks?
Are there risks? not entirely outside; we wanna jump into the next film and aim to shock people with this film! And keep them in awe with the second, and YOU can help out! Regardless, films take a while to make, and we didn't wanna wait too long to make it, so help us out by pre-ordering this horror film, buy props, share indiegogo around and help us reach the goal... Nay, help us go past our goal, and the more money coming in, the bigger we can make the next! $15K, is the MINIMUM goal to make it... imagine if we have $50K...Let's make it happen!

Other Ways You Can Help
SHARE IT! A lot of support that comes into indiegogos, and people reaching there goal is based on support and usually they have a name that brings that! A lot of our films are underground and reaching a niche audience with the brutality and graphic content... Now, we are trying to reach a wider audience and we NEED all the help we can get!",0.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<h3>Who am I?</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Nace DeSanders. I am an independent writer, director, and producer. Steadily advancing my skills and knowledge as a filmmaker for the past few years, I have independently developed a number of short films, all of which received/ are receiving praise at film festivals! </p>
<p>It is crucial that I strike while the iron is hot and take the next step which is directing a feature film! Hello Sickness is an extremely personal story that I know needs to be told and, quite frankly, needs to be told by someone who looks like me! Someone with the life experiences I have! </p>
<h3>What Is It?</h3>
<p>A totally new, weird experimental feature film, written and directed by Nace DeSanders, Hello Sickness is about a young woman who moves to rural South Africa to care for her sick grandmother but instead gets wrapped up making and avoiding friends. The film heavily plays on the reliable narrator technique to create a surreal atmosphere in a truly unique story.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>So at the moment, the budget for Hello Sickness is about $100,000 USD. We have secured some funding (about $25,000) but are looking to supplement that through this campaign. Your money will go towards things like...</p>
<ul>
<li>Purchasing the funky vintage props</li>
<li>Purchasing the plane tickets for the few foreign cast members</li>
<li>Renting out the beautiful locations</li>
<li>Feeding the hardworking (and limited) cast and crew!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why Is It Important?</h3>
<p>Hello Sickness will allow me and many of those involved to gain valuable learning experiences. This will allow us to shoot more and better films in the future!</p>
<p>By supporting this film, you are not just helping a single film get made, you are kickstarting the careers of multiple young, female filmmakers!</p>
<p>After making the first feature film, it becomes MUCH easier to reach out to production companies and studios. The first feature film is proof that we are serious as young filmmakers.</p>
<p>You want more women in film? This is your chance to support that!</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>A 8-12 minute experimental short film. TOUCH follows a queer love story of two post-grads. The relationship is told through their physical interactions with one another rather than depending on dialogue. Alex learns mindfulness with Talia, signaling a magical glow that protrudes out of them in moments of deep content. Unfortunately, both of them are in a transitional period in life. Talia is avoiding the impending reality of adulthood when she gets accepted to a job in a new city. Meanwhile, Alex must comes to terms with the fact that their relationship will be cut short and must learn to appreciate the time they share.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Directors Statement</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Hanna Rose Biebel, a senior cinema student at Elon University. My reasoning for wanting to tell this story is based on its central themes -- mindfulness, and intimacy. Practicing mindfulness offers me peace within my body, mind, and physical surroundings. Being able to interpret mindfulness in this short film will send the message to my audience, and reinforce it in my own head, that these moments are extremely gratifying and a beautiful part of the human experience. The same goes for intimacy. What it means to be intimate with someone. How wonderful it feels to be in the moment with someone, and how foreign it can feel when that moment is gone. Both mindfulness and intimacy can feel ethereal at times which is what I want to capture in this short.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution to this project will help make a positive impact to the LGBT+ film genre. Many LGBT+ films are centered around the same storylines, such as coming out and accepting themselves for who they are. This is where TOUCH comes in, it's moved on from that. This is a story of young love through the eyes of body language and physical affection. It's a universal language and something every person craves.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>This is a true collaboration of Elon's cinema department! This project represents a chance for all involved to learn and grow as artists. Additional students from other departments at our school will be joining in the near future. </p>
<p><strong>Writer/Director:</strong> Hanna Rose Biebel, senior </p>
<p><strong>Producer:</strong> Alex Chadwick, sophomore </p>
<p><strong>Director of photography + Camera operator:</strong> Rebecca Potters, junior</p>
<p><strong>1st and 2nd AC:</strong> MK Douglas, senior </p>
<p><strong>Gaffer:</strong> Hector Lopez, junior</p>
<p><strong>Sound mixer:</strong> Ben O'Connor, junior</p>
<h3>Budget </h3>
<p>This budget allows us to make this short possible! We want to ensure the crew is well taken care of and nourished on set. An original score will be created in paid partnership with students from Elon University’s music department. A nominal acting fee will also be set aside for our actresses from the theatre school. Other costs include props, locations, transportation, and practical effects.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways to Help</h3>
<p>Not everyone is in the position to donate money, but that's totally okay! You can still help support our vision. Spread the word to your friends and family, and share our campaign on social media too! &lt;3 </p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p><i>Avatar: Flames of Ren</i> is <strong>a</strong> <strong>short action film</strong> based on the universe of the animated series <i>Avatar: The Last Airbender </i>by<i> </i>Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko.</p>
<p><i>Avatar: Flames of Ren</i> is about a young firebender who embarks on a dangerous quest to find and kill the avatar.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622888400/oagjrpax1omewc7iruy4.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Ethan De Guzman as 'Ren'  (look-test, 2021)</i></p>
<h3>Personal Note:</h3>
<p>I began this personal project out of passion for filmmaking, martial arts and the ATLA series. Watching the series as a kid, the profound spiritual journey of Aang and the emotional self-discovery of Zuko made a powerful impact on me growing up and has, in many ways shaped my personal values.</p>
<p><i>Avatar: Flames of Ren</i> is a spiritual journey of self discovery and acceptance.  This project is my quest, as a filmmaker, to express something similar as creative and as entertaining as possible within a short film.</p>
<p>I originally started this project way back in 2016. However, the project had been shelved.  This year however, because of a growing interest from my short clip (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5KI01ENSNU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5KI01ENSNU</a>) I decided to revive the project and try again here at <strong>Indiegogo.</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625473321/s9xbckqsjywjtpe3q0ca.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>STORY</h3>
<p>Our story takes place a few generations following Avatar Wan. Imagine a war-torn world before the four nations were even established. It is a time when the Avatar’s existence was still just a rumour not known to many and only understood by a few.</p>
<p>Ren, a young firebender, lost everything. He is a victim of war, haunted by nightmares of a horrible past - visions of fire, blood and echoing screams. Amidst all this destruction, were those unforgettable, terrifying, glowing eyes staring back at him - the Avatar.</p>
<p>We follow Ren as he searches for the Avatar for whom no one has seen in decades. Through his journey, his hateful flames grow furious as he becomes stronger. Ren endures many obstacles including fierce battles against other elemental benders.</p>
<p>With only a scroll depicting a spiritual tree to lead his way Ren eventually finds the Avatar who has been seemingly waiting for him. They fight a fierce battle but Ren is quickly overwhelmed. The Avatar is about to kill him when a strange but familiar power awakens within and he is able to deflect the final blow. Ren’s eyes glow and the Avatar in front of him fades away smiling.</p>
<p>Ren’s anger had severely blinded him from the truth - that he is the next Avatar and has always been. His fierce hate towards the Avatar had blocked his spiritual connection. His journey has allowed him to breakthrough. Thus he is able to discover himself.</p>
<p>Well, would you look at that, <i>Flames of Ren</i> is exactly what Zuko was blabbing about: <i>""you must look in yourself, to save yourself from your other self. Only then will your true self, reveal itself.""</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622888941/cwzpfjqxc5ncndbir7ny.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>FIGHT SCENES</h3>
<p>We want to give fans the fight scenes that they have been craving for.  As fans would know, bending in Avatar is based on specific styles of Chinese martial arts.</p>
<p><i>Firebending</i> - <strong>Northern Shaolin</strong></p>
<p><i>Earthbending</i> - <strong>Southern Kung fu</strong></p>
<p><i>Airbending</i> - <strong>Baguazhang</strong></p>
<p><i>Waterbending</i> - <strong>Tai Chi</strong></p>
<p>As a passionate wushu* practitioner myself, I am very particular and strict about fight sequences.  <strong>I believe that it is important to be authentic and to clearly showcase the martial arts roots of each elemental bending style.</strong> It will be exciting to work with my coach and teammates from NZ Wushu who are all too familiar with these.</p>
<p>*<i>Wushu us a compound of all Chinese traditional Martial arts.</i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625475134/js0jtsvjfklffrddqlsp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Coach Wei Zhao demonstrating Tai Chi and 'Soft Fist' (Waterbending)</i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3>WEAPONS</h3>
<p>In the real world, <i>Northern Shaolin, southern kung fu, Baguazhang</i> and <i>Tai Chi</i> also actually use a variety of weapons within their styles.</p>
<p>In the original ATLA series, we saw elemental <strong>bending with weapons</strong>: we saw a lot of Aang with his staff, briefly with Kyoshi and her fans, even an earthbender with hammers and Zuko with dual broadswords. However we did not see much of it.</p>
<p>As such, I also want to explore elemental bending with weapons. I believe that it would be exciting and refreshing to see. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622889039/pzz97soabcpdqe76o95x.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Waterbender weilding a Jian (straightsword) - also used in Tai Chi</i></p>
<h2> </h2>
<h3>Funding</h3>
<p>Avatar: Flames of Ren is an action short film. Action is already hard enough to film morever action with elemental simulations! <strong>Most of the funding will go towards VFX</strong> which is the hardest part of this project.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, a project like this requires a lot of time and resources. A lack of funding is the only thing holding us back. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>We offer some exciting rewards for those who sponsor us including an exclusive <strong>White Lotus challenge coin</strong> and tailor-made <strong>cinematic costumes </strong>which<strong> </strong>will be made by our talented costume designer Jay Conanan.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Costumes / Wardrobe look-test (old cast of 2016, new cast is being determined)</i></p>

<p>We are also offering a Filmmaker's Pack for filmmakers that might be interested in how this whole process was brought about. How the story was written, approach in cinematography, grading, choreography - everything from pre-production, production and post-production including setting up this crowdfunding campaign.

<p> </p>
<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<p><strong>$20,000</strong> - With this, we will be able to spend more on great VFX for awesome looking elemental simulations - which are understandably time consuming and expensive.</p>
<p><strong>$40,000</strong> - With more than double the budget, we will be able to extend action scenes and spend even more on VFX. While telling a good story is important, let's be honest, most people are looking to being entertained with awesome fight sequences - and those are expensive!</p>
<p><strong>$70,000</strong> - With this accomplishment, we can have a bigger crew, better cameras, more cinematic lenses! This makes for a greater quality short action film!</p>
<p><strong>$100,000</strong> - Woah! That's a lot! Is that even possible? We can only dream! But with this achievement, we can go all out and make something truly epic - more intense fight scenes, extended sets for gorgeous landscapes, longer story and just an overall better cinematic experience.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>I love Avatar, martial arts and filmmaking. <i>Avatar: Ren’s Flames</i> is all three in one and would be a dream come true for me personally. It is a passion project promising exciting bending fight scenes and a meaningful experience. If this campaign is successful, we will be releasing the short film online for all to enjoy.</p>
<p>I am really excited to bring this project to life and can only happen with your help. If you are even a little bit excited about this as I am and you’d like to help out, please sponsor us today!</p>

I began this personal project out of passion for filmmaking, martial arts and the ATLA series. Watching the series as a kid, the profound spiritual journey of Aang and the emotional self-discovery of Zuko made a powerful impact on me growing up and has, in many ways shaped my personal values.
Avatar: Flames of Ren is a spiritual journey of self discovery and acceptance.  This project is my quest, as a filmmaker, to express something similar as creative and as entertaining as possible within a short film.
I originally started this project way back in 2016. However, the project had been shelved.  This year however, because of a growing interest from my short clip (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C5KI01ENSNU) I decided to revive the project and try again here at Indiegogo.

 
STORY
Our story takes place a few generations following Avatar Wan. Imagine a war-torn world before the four nations were even established. It is a time when the Avatar’s existence was still just a rumour not known to many and only understood by a few.
Ren, a young firebender, lost everything. He is a victim of war, haunted by nightmares of a horrible past - visions of fire, blood and echoing screams. Amidst all this destruction, were those unforgettable, terrifying, glowing eyes staring back at him - the Avatar.
We follow Ren as he searches for the Avatar for whom no one has seen in decades. Through his journey, his hateful flames grow furious as he becomes stronger. Ren endures many obstacles including fierce battles against other elemental benders.
With only a scroll depicting a spiritual tree to lead his way Ren eventually finds the Avatar who has been seemingly waiting for him. They fight a fierce battle but Ren is quickly overwhelmed. The Avatar is about to kill him when a strange but familiar power awakens within and he is able to deflect the final blow. Ren’s eyes glow and the Avatar in front of him fades away smiling.
Ren’s anger had severely blinded him from the truth - that he is the next Avatar and has always been. His fierce hate towards the Avatar had blocked his spiritual connection. His journey has allowed him to breakthrough. Thus he is able to discover himself.
Well, would you look at that, Flames of Ren is exactly what Zuko was blabbing about: ""you must look in yourself, to save yourself from your other self. Only then will your true self, reveal itself.""
 

 

FIGHT SCENES
We want to give fans the fight scenes that they have been craving for.  As fans would know, bending in Avatar is based on specific styles of Chinese martial arts.
Firebending - Northern Shaolin
Earthbending - Southern Kung fu
Airbending - Baguazhang
Waterbending - Tai Chi
As a passionate wushu* practitioner myself, I am very particular and strict about fight sequences.  I believe that it is important to be authentic and to clearly showcase the martial arts roots of each elemental bending style. It will be exciting to work with my coach and teammates from NZ Wushu who are all too familiar with these.
*Wushu us a compound of all Chinese traditional Martial arts.

WEAPONS
In the real world, Northern Shaolin, southern kung fu, Baguazhang and Tai Chi also actually use a variety of weapons within their styles.
In the original ATLA series, we saw elemental bending with weapons: we saw a lot of Aang with his staff, briefly with Kyoshi and her fans, even an earthbender with hammers and Zuko with dual broadswords. However we did not see much of it.
As such, I also want to explore elemental bending with weapons. I believe that it would be exciting and refreshing to see.

Funding
Avatar: Flames of Ren is an action short film. Action is already hard enough to film morever action with elemental simulations! Most of the funding will go towards VFX which is the hardest part of this project.
As you can imagine, a project like this requires a lot of time and resources. A lack of funding is the only thing holding us back. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
We offer some exciting rewards for those who sponsor us including an exclusive White Lotus challenge coin and tailor-made cinematic costumes which will be made by our talented costume designer Jay Conanan.


Costumes / Wardrobe look-test (old cast of 2016, new cast is being determined)
 
We are also offering a Filmmaker's Pack for filmmakers that might be interested in how this whole process was brought about. How the story was written, approach in cinematography, grading, choreography - everything from pre-production, production and post-production including setting up this crowdfunding campaign. In collaboration with Zack McCarthy from CG Visuals, we are also giving away Trapcode Elements for those who avail of the Filmmaker's Pack.

Other Ways You Can Help
We are open to all the help we can get.  If you're a VFX artist, 3D modeler, dynamics simulator, matte painter, compositor or storyboard artist, you are all welcome.  Also, if you think you can help in other ways please email joey.de.guzman90@gmail.com

Stretch Goals
$20,000 - With this, we will be able to spend more on great VFX for awesome looking elemental simulations - which are understandably time consuming and expensive.
$40,000 - With more than double the budget, we will be able to extend action scenes and spend even more on VFX. While telling a good story is important, let's be honest, most people are looking to being entertained with awesome fight sequences - and those are expensive!
$70,000 - With this accomplishment, we can have a bigger crew, better cameras, more cinematic lenses! This makes for a greater quality short action film!
$100,000 - Woah! That's a lot! Is that even possible? We can only dream! But with this achievement, we can go all out and make something truly epic - more intense fight scenes, extended sets for gorgeous landscapes, longer story and just an overall better cinematic experience.
 
CONCLUSION
I love Avatar, martial arts and filmmaking. Avatar: Ren’s Flames is all three in one and would be a dream come true for me personally. It is a passion project promising exciting bending fight scenes and a meaningful experience. If this campaign is successful, we will be releasing the short film online for all to enjoy.
I am really excited to bring this project to life and can only happen with your help. If you are even a little bit excited about this as I am and you’d like to help out, please sponsor us today!",9.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Greetings film fans thank you for a few minutes of your time. We are Little Spark Films an indie production team operating out of DFW Tx and WAGES OF SIN is our teams newest project.</p>

<p>A micro budget feature,  blending of Drama, Horror and Comedy. It's the story of strung out lawyer Sinclair Niedenthal in the late 90's, whose world is falling apart. Procuring a sleazy motel room in secret there are only two things he wants; a stress free night with no hassles and a big bag of dope. Unfortunately he will only be getting the latter as things soon take a turn for the weird, when after a physical altercation with Darby, a pizza delivery man, Sinclair determines the only option is to take him captive. Escalating the rest of the night into a drug-fueled battle of wills for survival.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Even on a small production like hours cost Mount up pretty quickly. On this project we've essentially cut all of the fat but that still leaves a lot of things to be covered. From location rentals, set dressing, original wardrobe Construction, props construction and Rentals, maintaining our equipment, makeup and practical effects, feeding cast and crew, boarding and transportation, post-production special effects and sound as well as the extra money we will be putting towards ensuring that we will have a COVID-19 SAFE SET! Not to mention, this is always important but especially in the times we're in now, we need to be able to pay our crew a living wage. Too many small Productions ask their Crew to give their all and get very little back but right now with working on a movie set being more dangerous than ever and making a living so much harder we find this to be unacceptable.</p>

<p>As you can see there is so much that needs to go in to every aspect to make this film work but luckily we're the guys who know how to make it work. However that only can happen with your help and just like with our crew we are not asking you to give us something for nothing. We have 25 reward tiers for contributors ranging from digital copies of the film and soundtrack to t-shirts, set worn wardrobe and W.O.S. sock puppet friends. Then the upper tiers offer an awesome custom pizza box goody crate full of various stickers, patches, pins and other movie memorabilia as well as producer credit tiers. Lots of fun goodies for every price range so make sure to check out the full list.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In the wake of Covid-19 financing any movie is a tough sale but as you can tell from the above description (&amp; our video) this film is not what you would consider the norm and as such it makes it exceedingly difficult to secure independent financing. Which is why the support of you, the viewing public matters so much in this endeavor.  <br/>Cinema is at an interesting yet tumultuous Nexus point right now. Due to a Confluence of outside forces such as the rise in streaming media and the recent pandemic now all movies are forced to contend with movies that would have been the theatrical releases from major studios and as such movies like WAGES OF SIN are getting fewer and fewer. However the upside to that is that when one does come along and is crafted exceptionally well it becomes more visible. We want to make something that is against the grain, something Fearless, something that shows that all film can be art if handled properly; That embodies the core ideals of what Indie film making it supposed to be. We have the experience, the team and the vision but again we can't do it without you. <br/>We at Little Spark Films in the last year alone have completed 8 commercials, 3 music videos, 2 short films and a feature film. All of which have been completed on time, on budget and have exceeded expectation. A record we fully intend to maintain with WAGES OF SIN.</p>

Krauss went on to produce Chicken Soup For The Soul (1999-2001), writing and directing several episodes. Krauss also served as producer for Beyond The Glory, a documentary series profiling some of the most legendary athletes in history.

I was very aware of my size at a very young age. Don't get me wrong, my parents put me in every sport you could imagine and I danced throughout my entire childhood. As a child in both musical theatre and dance communities, being overweight made fitting in, let alone succeeding, very difficult.</p><p>I remember weighing 123lbs in 6th grade, and by my freshmen year of high school, I was 180lbs. In middle school, I’d wear two sports bras for fear I’d be made fun of because I was too saggy, and in high school I’d wear an abdominal compression guard (AKA Spanx) under my clothes. I hate the world that made me feel like I needed to wear these constricting undergarments in order to achieve what it said I needed to be — thin, small, perfect. I had a difficult time being cast in musicals as a high schooler, making me think the reason behind this was indeed my weight.</p><p>In college, I rapidly lost an astronomical amount of weight -- I was the smallest I'd ever been to this day. But this wasn't because I was more healthy or more active. It's because I've always thought that in order to be a ""successful"" actor, singer, dancer, I'd have to be thinner, smaller, skinnier. I started getting cast, gained praise for losing weight, and had an overall successful college musical theatre career... on paper. What nobody knew was that I was counting every single calorie I ate, I was obsessed with tracking my food intake, I was running 2 miles a day ON TOP OF spending hours in dance classes, rehearsals, and at the gym.</p><p>The summer after I graduated college with my BFA in musical theatre, I was cast in Music Theatre Wichita's production of <i>42nd Street</i>. At this point in my health journey, I was the smallest I had ever been in my life. I was on a paleo diet, eating less than 1,000 calories a day. I was spending 8 hours in rehearsals and not allowing myself to eat a single thing off the ""goodie"" table. To top it all off, I was definitely not eating three full meals a day.</p><p>There was one specific cast party during the run of this show that I will never forget -- I didn't even want to go, out of fear that there'd be food I wouldn't allow myself to eat, and people would judge me for not eating it. </p><p>I didn't know it at the time, but in hindsight, this was my lowest point. Though I never experienced exactly what Gemma goes through in this film, it's very clear to me that so many people do. This breaks my heart, and it should break yours too.</p><p>Stemming from a true series of events, I felt compelled to tell this story for myself, for female musical theatre majors, and for females in the entertainment industry everywhere. The toxic ideologies and stigmas presented in the film are *still* very much present in the entertainment industry today, and have been for years and years and years.</p><p>My question to myself is: ""Megan, how are you going to fight for change within these systems?"" </p><p>My answer to this question is and always has been <i>through my art. </i></p><p>I am determined to get this project <strong>seen</strong> by those who need to see it.

<h3>Some Questions That Are Explored in <i>Queering Yoga</i>
</h3>
<p>What is the
intersection of Queer/Trans identities and yoga?</p>
<p>How can yoga
benefit the lives of Queer/Trans people?</p>
<p>What does empowered
and embodied visibility look like for the Queer and Trans communities? </p>
<h3>How It Began<br/>
</h3>
<p>The idea for <i>Queering Yoga</i> arose after I interviewed participant Sparkle Thornton, for an article about the intersection of her
Trans identity and yoga practice in 2014 for <i>Original Plumbing </i><i>Magazine</i>.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.originalplumbing.com/index.php/the-basics/interviews/item/731-an-interview-with-a-trans-yogi"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span><span>http://www.originalplumbing.com/index.php/the-basics/interviews/item/731-an-interview-with-a-trans-yogi</span></span></a></p>
<p>This
interview received an overwhelmingly positive response, inspiring us to go
further. A documentary is a powerful way to reach a larger audience and to tell
empowering stories of Queer and Trans lives from the perspective of Queer/Trans
yoga teachers. A film like this has never been made before!</p>
<p>As the
Producer/Director of <i>Queering
Yoga</i>, I’ve been actively working on the documentary with a
wonderful team of Queer/Trans crew members and one ally since May 2015.</p>
<p>So far we’ve filmed five powerful interviews of amazing and
dynamic participants who have riveting stories they have shared with us.</p>
<p>To go further and to continue this project we need to raise funds for production costs.  </p>

<p><b><u>Director</u></b><b><u>’</u></b><b><u>s Statement</u></b>­</p>
<p>There is
still so much more education, awareness, and diversity that needs to be
represented and seen through mainstream media about Queer and Trans lives. I’m passionate about continuing to create “conscious
media”that focuses on authentic representations of Queer and
Trans living from empowered and integrated perspectives. As a Queer/Trans
filmmaker, I’m all too aware of who is telling our stories. It is so vital for Queer and Trans artists, writers, and
filmmakers to be the one’s sharing our own lives and experiences from
perspectives that aren’t sensationalized, objectified, or
purely for profit.</p>
<p>As a
Queer/Trans filmmaker who is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about
Queer/Trans cinema and history, there currently isn’t a documentary in existence that represents Trans
and/or Queer identified yoga teachers exploring the intersection of yoga and these identities. <i>Queering Yoga</i> is an intimate portrait about the Queer/Trans yoga
movement. </p>
<p>It is important for empowered and integrated Queer and Trans lives to be represented
in media. It’s time to take our stories into our
own hands and hearts and make media about them. <i>Queering Yoga</i> will continue the conversation about Queer and Trans
people from an empowered perspective. <i>Queering
Yoga</i> explores the
intersection of yoga and identity with groundbreaking representation of diverse
perspectives from Queer/Trans yoga teachers, made by Queer/Trans filmmakers!</p>
<p>The ancient,
Indian origins of yoga are honored and appreciated by the filmmakers and
participants of <i>Queering Yoga</i>. <i>Queering Yoga</i> is the continuation of that ancient practice into the
hearts and lives of Queer, Trans, Allies, and POC living in the Western world.</p>
<p>As a white
(Eastern European Jew, a quarter Mexican, and a quarter German), Queer/Trans
individual living in the U.S., I have questioned my purpose in the Queer yoga
movement through my own meditations; I've confided in trusted healers, and I
offer my intention for this project: To serve in the highest interest of all.</p>

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Some critiques have arisen regarding cultural appropriation for this new community film project that I would like to address. Below is an excerpt that I wrote in the Director's Statement about Queering Yoga. It's on the Queering Yoga film homepage. </span><a href=""http://www.queeringyoga.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">www.queeringyoga.com</a><br/>
</div><div>
<p>""The ancient, Indian origins of yoga are honored and appreciated by the filmmakers and participants of Queering Yoga. Queering Yoga is the continuation of that ancient practice into the hearts and lives of Queer, Trans, Allies, and POC living in the Western world. </p>
<p>As a white (Eastern European Jew, a quarter Mexican, and a quarter German), Queer/Trans individual living in the U.S., I have questioned my purpose in the Queer yoga movement through my own meditations; I've confided in trusted healers, and I offer my intention for this project: To serve in the highest interest of all.""</p>
<p>I would also like to add that Yoga was brought to America by Indians (from India) for the purpose of elevating the consciousness of Americans and to teach them about yoga. The teachings were brought here so that people in the West could learn the tools and skills of this ancient Spiritual practice and utilize them for personal growth, healing, and transformation. Yoga did not only remain encapsulated in India. </p>
<p>The Spirit of Yoga is alive in America, helping people to elevate and awaken to a true and kinder state of consciousness. <br/>The intentions of Queering Yoga are to continue this message and to spread the teachings of yoga through stories of healing and transformation through the practice of yoga from all of the participants in this film. This is expressed through a Queer/Trans perspective. Another intention of the film is to introduce the practice of yoga to countless Queer, Trans, POC, and Allies in the West! To create and nurture inclusive, safe spaces to practice yoga in community! </p>
<p>Another aim of this project is to show participants who decolonize their yoga practices individually, as a community, and as yoga teachers who are mindful, aware, and honor the Ancient Indian origins of yoga with respect, reverence, and with historical consciousness. </p>
<p>Half of the participants in Queering Yoga identify as QTPOC. There are QTPOC crew members as well as QTPOC individuals who are on the Community Advisory Board. Queering Yoga is still in the production and crowdfund phases. I'm still interviewing participants for the project and South Asian voices will be included in the film as well as on the Community Advisory Board. To make this happen, I need your support! To continue interviewing participants and filming them for the project, we need to raise more money through our crowdfund campaign to complete production. </p>
<p>An inspiring documentary that I would like to recommend is AWAKE: The Life Of Yogananda. Yogananda had a spiritual calling to leave India and come to America to teach about yoga as well as other spiritual teachings. I highly recommend this documentary. </p>

It'll help us introduce the practice of yoga to countless Trans & Queer people through this powerful documentary about stories of healing and transformation through yoga!

QUEERING YOGA!


Queering Yoga explores the intersection of Queer/Trans identities and the burgeoning tradition of yoga. Participants share their stories of transformation and healing through yoga. Queer/Trans filmmakers along with Queer and/or Trans yoga teachers are creating a film by and for our community! 



“Queering yoga” means queering the yoga practice (not the people or participants). “Queering""— as in making
a binary, hetero-normative and Western culturally-appropriated spiritual fitness
practice work for us as LGBTQIA spectrum people, as well as
bringing cultural sensitivity, acknowledging access, oppression, the origins of
yoga and how POC folks feel entering a space that is largely straight, white,
upper/middle class, cisgender and female. We are stretching/queering yoga to
include a lot of people, not simply queer identities. 





Some Questions That Are Explored in Queering Yoga

What is the
intersection of Queer/Trans identities and yoga?
How can yoga
benefit the lives of Queer/Trans people?
What does empowered
and embodied visibility look like for the Queer and Trans communities? 
How It Began

The idea for Queering Yoga arose after I interviewed participant Sparkle Thornton, for an article about the intersection of her
Trans identity and yoga practice in 2014 for Original Plumbing Magazine.
http://www.originalplumbing.com/index.php/the-basics/interviews/item/731-an-interview-with-a-trans-yogi
This
interview received an overwhelmingly positive response, inspiring us to go
further. A documentary is a powerful way to reach a larger audience and to tell
empowering stories of Queer and Trans lives from the perspective of Queer/Trans
yoga teachers. A film like this has never been made before!
As the
Producer/Director of Queering
Yoga, I’ve been actively working on the documentary with a
wonderful team of Queer/Trans crew members and one ally since May 2015.
So far we’ve filmed five powerful interviews of amazing and
dynamic participants who have riveting stories they have shared with us.
To go further and to continue this project we need to raise funds for production costs.

The Impact



Director’s Statement­
There is
still so much more education, awareness, and diversity that needs to be
represented and seen through mainstream media about Queer and Trans lives. I’m passionate about continuing to create “conscious
media”that focuses on authentic representations of Queer and
Trans living from empowered and integrated perspectives. As a Queer/Trans
filmmaker, I’m all too aware of who is telling our stories. It is so vital for Queer and Trans artists, writers, and
filmmakers to be the one’s sharing our own lives and experiences from
perspectives that aren’t sensationalized, objectified, or
purely for profit.
As a
Queer/Trans filmmaker who is extremely knowledgeable and passionate about
Queer/Trans cinema and history, there currently isn’t a documentary in existence that represents Trans
and/or Queer identified yoga teachers exploring the intersection of yoga and these identities. Queering Yoga is an intimate portrait about the Queer/Trans yoga
movement. 
It is important for empowered and integrated Queer and Trans lives to be represented
in media. It’s time to take our stories into our
own hands and hearts and make media about them. Queering Yoga will continue the conversation about Queer and Trans
people from an empowered perspective. Queering
Yoga explores the
intersection of yoga and identity with groundbreaking representation of diverse
perspectives from Queer/Trans yoga teachers, made by Queer/Trans filmmakers!
The ancient,
Indian origins of yoga are honored and appreciated by the filmmakers and
participants of Queering Yoga. Queering Yoga is the continuation of that ancient practice into the
hearts and lives of Queer, Trans, Allies, and POC living in the Western world.
As a white
(Eastern European Jew, a quarter Mexican, and a quarter German), Queer/Trans
individual living in the U.S., I have questioned my purpose in the Queer yoga
movement through my own meditations; I've confided in trusted healers, and I
offer my intention for this project: To serve in the highest interest of all.

UPDATE: Director's Statement
Some critiques have arisen regarding cultural appropriation for this new community film project that I would like to address. Below is an excerpt that I wrote in the Director's Statement about Queering Yoga. It's on the Queering Yoga film homepage. www.queeringyoga.com

""The ancient, Indian origins of yoga are honored and appreciated by the filmmakers and participants of Queering Yoga. Queering Yoga is the continuation of that ancient practice into the hearts and lives of Queer, Trans, Allies, and POC living in the Western world. 
As a white (Eastern European Jew, a quarter Mexican, and a quarter German), Queer/Trans individual living in the U.S., I have questioned my purpose in the Queer yoga movement through my own meditations; I've confided in trusted healers, and I offer my intention for this project: To serve in the highest interest of all.""
I would also like to add that Yoga was brought to America by Indians (from India) for the purpose of elevating the consciousness of Americans and to teach them about yoga. The teachings were brought here so that people in the West could learn the tools and skills of this ancient Spiritual practice and utilize them for personal growth, healing, and transformation. Yoga did not only remain encapsulated in India. 
The Spirit of Yoga is alive in America, helping people to elevate and awaken to a true and kinder state of consciousness. The intentions of Queering Yoga are to continue this message and to spread the teachings of yoga through stories of healing and transformation through the practice of yoga from all of the participants in this film. This is expressed through a Queer/Trans perspective. Another intention of the film is to introduce the practice of yoga to countless Queer, Trans, POC, and Allies in the West! To create and nurture inclusive, safe spaces to practice yoga in community! 
Another aim of this project is to show participants who decolonize their yoga practices individually, as a community, and as yoga teachers who are mindful, aware, and honor the Ancient Indian origins of yoga with respect, reverence, and with historical consciousness. 
Half of the participants in Queering Yoga identify as QTPOC. There are QTPOC crew members as well as QTPOC individuals who are on the Community Advisory Board. Queering Yoga is still in the production and crowdfund phases. I'm still interviewing participants for the project and South Asian voices will be included in the film as well as on the Community Advisory Board. To make this happen, I need your support! To continue interviewing participants and filming them for the project, we need to raise more money through our crowdfund campaign to complete production. 
An inspiring documentary that I would like to recommend is AWAKE: The Life Of Yogananda. Yogananda had a spiritual calling to leave India and come to America to teach about yoga as well as other spiritual teachings. I highly recommend this documentary.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong><u>Brief description:</u></strong> ​ A young couple named Grayson Bailey and Nina Taylor move from Baltimore to Philadelphia to take the next step in their relationship. On a date at Penn’s Landing, Grayson and Nina eat lunch and start people watching. They fantasize about their future family together and joke about getting married. Grayson starts to have stomach pains and it worsens during the night after their date. Something is off. Frantic, Nina rushes Grayson to the hospital in hopes to confirm that he only has a stomach ache. Little did they know that Grayson would be diagnosed with something much worse.</p>
<p><u><strong>Director's Statement:</strong></u><strong>  </strong>I wanted to execute this film project for a couple of reasons. First, I have always enjoyed viewing and now making romance and young adult drama films. I also want to tell this story because I want to expose how anyone can come face to face with life’s finite disposition, regardless of age. Additionally, living in a time like the COVID- 19 pandemic has made me more aware of how relationship dynamics are tested by difficult and uncertain circumstances. Though I wasn’t the one going through cancer or having to immediately take care of someone who had cancer, my Granddad’s cancer scare made me realize just how quickly our lives can change. As I watched the dynamics between my grandparents shift completely when my granddad was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, I started to wonder how it would feel for someone younger to endure all the new responsibilities that my grandmother had to take on.</p>
<p>Though there are many tragic love stories out there, especially ones that revolve around illness, I haven’t seen many films in this category that revolve around a young couple who is beyond the teenage and/or ”college” age group. The age group of 22-35 is an interesting group to play with because there are so many mature topics to explore. For instance in my film, the two main characters are in their early-mid 20s and in a post-grad mindset of getting established in their careers and taking the next step in their relationship. They are not engaged, but they are moving in that direction. And having a film that plays with the idea of crushing that momentum in their young lives, by implementing colon cancer as an obstacle for their relationship, is something that will differentiate it from the teen drama films that explore romances with an ill character or characters. And it also starts the conversation on how black people, especially black males, younger than the age of 50 can be affected by colon cancer.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Shooting a strong, portfolio-quality film during this unprecedented time of the COVID-19 pandemic places extraordinary pressures on student filmmakers and all filmmakers in a number of ways: expense-wise, resource-wise and execution-wise.  The process of making a short film or feature-length film is already exorbitant. Renting equipment and spaces to film in; catering; legal clearances; and being able to hire professional actors and non-student team members for the film all contribute to the typical expenses of making a quality narrative film. The COVID-19 pandemic certainly introduces new, additional expenses to the process in order to follow proper COVID-19 protocols for shooting on sets. Such protocols require purchasing  proper masks, face shields, sanitizers and gloves; securing testing for everyone involved in the the film; and, extending the shooting time in order to reduce the number of hours of daily exposure to accomplish social distancing. Though shooting during these times can put a lot of pressure on the team, it is a very timely opportunity for those who are students on the team as filmmakers to learn how to work in all types of environments and think on our feet. Please know that your assistance through donations to this film will provide a huge support toward bringing, “ In Sickness And...” to life as it is envisioned. At the same time, your support will help prepare and further develop student filmmakers with a skill set to make a strong, professional level product in all types of environments despite unforeseen circumstances. We greatly appreciate your consideration and support!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The perks for contributing to the funding of this film are as follows:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Those who donate $25 will receive an, “ In Sickness And ...” Thank You collage card of the cast and crew head shots. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Those who donate $50 will receive a shout out post on our social media platforms for the ""In Sickness And…” film. </p>

<p>This is director Reigna Wren's largest film project to date. And she is super excited about getting to film this ambitious project in the spring! The <i>In Sickness And...</i> team is a diverse group of Black, Feminine, and LGBTQ+ identifying filmmakers. By supporting this project, you are helping young, female, BIPOC, and LGBTQ+ voices be heard across the arts and cinema. And allowing us to create a film that is festival quality. Like many budding filmmakers, it is our dream to go to major festivals like the Tribeca Film Festival, the  Atlanta Film Festival, Sundance, and so much more. But, before we can submit to these festivals, we need the funding to first make a great film. By attending these festivals with this film, it will allow the filmmakers on this project to receive notoriety for their hard work and build a network as they go into the industry and establish their career as creatives! </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Shooting during the COVID-19 pandemic is no small feat and is something that our team takes very serious. Normally, shooting a project this size wouldn't take more than three days with 14-hour filming sessions. But, with the new COVID-19 compliance rules for shooting on sets, our shoot is extended by two days due to having fewer crew members on set at a time. We'll have to take shifts to set up each scene in a socially distanced manner.  These time-consuming, precautionary steps must be taken each shooting day which cannot exceed 10-hours. More days to shoot means more days we have to pay for each set, greater equipment rental fees, and more pay for the actors and crew for the extended shooting time. Several months of educating ourselves on the SAG-AFTRA and other COVID-19 film union protocols have gone into preparation for filming during these times. To help execute this film as planned, we will take COVID-19 tests a week before the shoot; socially distance and quarantine leading up to and during times off of the set; wear proper PPE; and ensure that all team members are sanitizing and using the equipment and spaces safely. COVID-19 safety agreements and insurance coverage has been established to further ensure the safety of our cast and crew. Taking these steps put us one step further towards completing this project! </p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Thank you in advance for contributing to this project. We hope that you feel inspired to share this project with your friends and family and help us reach our goal. Every little bit helps and is certainly appreciated. We can't thank you enough for taking the time to read about this project and support our team!</p>
</div></div>","Short Summary
Brief description: ​ A young couple named Grayson Bailey and Nina Taylor move from Baltimore to Philadelphia to take the next step in their relationship. On a date at Penn’s Landing, Grayson and Nina eat lunch and start people watching. They fantasize about their future family together and joke about getting married. Grayson starts to have stomach pains and it worsens during the night after their date. Something is off. Frantic, Nina rushes Grayson to the hospital in hopes to confirm that he only has a stomach ache. Little did they know that Grayson would be diagnosed with something much worse.
Director's Statement:  I wanted to execute this film project for a couple of reasons. First, I have always enjoyed viewing and now making romance and young adult drama films. I also want to tell this story because I want to expose how anyone can come face to face with life’s finite disposition, regardless of age. Additionally, living in a time like the COVID- 19 pandemic has made me more aware of how relationship dynamics are tested by difficult and uncertain circumstances. Though I wasn’t the one going through cancer or having to immediately take care of someone who had cancer, my Granddad’s cancer scare made me realize just how quickly our lives can change. As I watched the dynamics between my grandparents shift completely when my granddad was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, I started to wonder how it would feel for someone younger to endure all the new responsibilities that my grandmother had to take on.
Though there are many tragic love stories out there, especially ones that revolve around illness, I haven’t seen many films in this category that revolve around a young couple who is beyond the teenage and/or ”college” age group. The age group of 22-35 is an interesting group to play with because there are so many mature topics to explore. For instance in my film, the two main characters are in their early-mid 20s and in a post-grad mindset of getting established in their careers and taking the next step in their relationship. They are not engaged, but they are moving in that direction. And having a film that plays with the idea of crushing that momentum in their young lives, by implementing colon cancer as an obstacle for their relationship, is something that will differentiate it from the teen drama films that explore romances with an ill character or characters. And it also starts the conversation on how black people, especially black males, younger than the age of 50 can be affected by colon cancer.
- Reigna Wren, Writer and Director of In Sickness And...

What We Need & What You Get
Shooting a strong, portfolio-quality film during this unprecedented time of the COVID-19 pandemic places extraordinary pressures on student filmmakers and all filmmakers in a number of ways: expense-wise, resource-wise and execution-wise.  The process of making a short film or feature-length film is already exorbitant. Renting equipment and spaces to film in; catering; legal clearances; and being able to hire professional actors and non-student team members for the film all contribute to the typical expenses of making a quality narrative film. The COVID-19 pandemic certainly introduces new, additional expenses to the process in order to follow proper COVID-19 protocols for shooting on sets. Such protocols require purchasing  proper masks, face shields, sanitizers and gloves; securing testing for everyone involved in the the film; and, extending the shooting time in order to reduce the number of hours of daily exposure to accomplish social distancing. Though shooting during these times can put a lot of pressure on the team, it is a very timely opportunity for those who are students on the team as filmmakers to learn how to work in all types of environments and think on our feet. Please know that your assistance through donations to this film will provide a huge support toward bringing, “ In Sickness And...” to life as it is envisioned. At the same time, your support will help prepare and further develop student filmmakers with a skill set to make a strong, professional level product in all types of environments despite unforeseen circumstances. We greatly appreciate your consideration and support!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Masa, late 30s, is an uptight singleton living in Tokyo as a manga writer who learns that his estranged father is on the verge of death after a stroke. In a moment of reflection, realizing that, as an only son, and unmarried that his father may have expected more of him, Masa hires a rental actress, Kanako, to fool his father into thinking that he has a fiancée.  </p>
<p>Kanako, lost and lonely in the big city, harbors dreams of stardom as a stage performer and uses her job as a springboard to improve her acting skills. Ultimately, she's disillusioned by the task of lying to strangers. </p>
<p>As the months go by with Kanako's visits, Masa soon falls for her and starts to write anonymous love letters. While in reality their relationship is stilted and impersonal, with the lyrical and eloquently-written letters, Masa finds a way to Kanako's heart.  </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>
<p>We are at an early stage of our production. We plan to shoot this film over 14 days in December.</p>
<p>But a musical demands a lot of preparation and our project is still a work in progress... a lot of elements need to come together to work.</p>
<p>Because of the nature of our film, with a long period of rehearsals, composing, and choreography to get through, we are vulnerable to potential delays that could see the production dates pushed back to early 2020.</p>
<p>Things are going well however, and if we manage to avoid any major setbacks, we will be able to meet that shoot date!</p>
<p>We're currently developing and recording the 5 original songs, hiring our dancers and extras and getting ready to choreograph the dance sequences.</p>
<p>For September/October we're planning casting sessions, rehearsals and location scouting.</p>
<p>As for the funding - it will be a big boost to allow us to commence all these processes. It will go to studio rental, the costs of recording and engineering the songs, the rehearsals, and the costs of locations, as well as cast and crew payment.</p>
<p>Any small amount will be a huge boost and we are deeply passionate about making this film happen. Thank you!</p>

<p><br/>現在、制作の初期段階にあります。撮影は12月から2週間かけて、インディーズスタイルで行う予定です。撮影を12月から始める理由としては、ミュージカルの要素である音楽の製作や、ダンスレッスンに多くの時間が必要となるからです。すでに録音してある1曲以外にも、他に4曲を製作・録音し、ダンサーやエキストラを選抜し稽古をしなければ、リハーサルやロケハンを進めることもできません。また、こうした制作準備を進める上で、資金調達が大変重要になってきます。スタジオのレンタルや録音、曲のエンジニアリングには莫大な費用がかかります。</p>
<p>わずかな金額でも、私たちが情熱を捧げるこの作品にとって大きな助けとなります。ぜひご協力いただければ幸いです。</p>
<p>本プロジェクトはAll-in方式で実施します。目標金額に満たない場合も、計画を実行し、リターンをお届けします。</p>
<p>日本中で話題になる美しいミュージカル映画を作りたいと思っています。</p>

'Make-Believers' will be a first-of-its-kind, Hollywood-influenced, musical rom-com drama set in Japan.  We will be working with a group of talented young composers and filmmakers.  (Listen to our one of the five original songs for the film here):
ミュージカルには以前から興味がありました。ミュージカルの要素である、“振り付けや構成の美しさ”“感情に訴えかける音楽”で、言葉にならない感情を表現することができるからです。

Join us on our journey toward making a range of musical numbers from soaring to heartfelt, designing vibrant dance-sequence imagery and delivering emotional drama... 
そこで、こうした重要なテーマとミュージカルを掛け合わせ、非現実的な美しさを作り出したいと考えました。
私たちの目標は、インディペンデントで、オリジナルの日本のミュージカル映画を作ることです。
... while channeling the charm and breezy vibes of Woody Allen films like Everyone Says I Love You 

...Midnight in Paris ....

...with contemporary film musicals... 

Marking the feature film debut of Kenjo McCurtain, award-winning writer/director of the short films 'Automation': 

and 'The Widow (Yamome)'  


 
Our Story
Masa, late 30s, is an uptight singleton living in Tokyo as a manga writer who learns that his estranged father is on the verge of death after a stroke. In a moment of reflection, realizing that, as an only son, and unmarried that his father may have expected more of him, Masa hires a rental actress, Kanako, to fool his father into thinking that he has a fiancée.  
Kanako, lost and lonely in the big city, harbors dreams of stardom as a stage performer and uses her job as a springboard to improve her acting skills. Ultimately, she's disillusioned by the task of lying to strangers. 
As the months go by with Kanako's visits, Masa soon falls for her and starts to write anonymous love letters. While in reality their relationship is stilted and impersonal, with the lyrical and eloquently-written letters, Masa finds a way to Kanako's heart.  
主人公は内気で独身の漫画家。
疎遠だった父が危篤であることを知る。充実した姿を最後に見せようと、妻としてレンタルファミリーの女優を雇い、偽りの事実を作る。
しかし、思いがけず父の病状が良くなり、それと共に彼らの嘘が明らかになっていく。
And she soon begins to write back to her secret admirer.  It becomes apparent that only in their faceless communications can they have a meaningful relationship.  
And only through song can they truly express themselves… Is it too late for him to reveal himself before she makes a move to further her career?  
And how will they maintain their lies as the father's death delays and the family learns of Masa's new love?

Risks & Challenges

We are at an early stage of our production. We plan to shoot this film over 14 days in December.
But a musical demands a lot of preparation and our project is still a work in progress... a lot of elements need to come together to work.
Because of the nature of our film, with a long period of rehearsals, composing, and choreography to get through, we are vulnerable to potential delays that could see the production dates pushed back to early 2020.
Things are going well however, and if we manage to avoid any major setbacks, we will be able to meet that shoot date!
We're currently developing and recording the 5 original songs, hiring our dancers and extras and getting ready to choreograph the dance sequences.
For September/October we're planning casting sessions, rehearsals and location scouting.
As for the funding - it will be a big boost to allow us to commence all these processes. It will go to studio rental, the costs of recording and engineering the songs, the rehearsals, and the costs of locations, as well as cast and crew payment.
Any small amount will be a huge boost and we are deeply passionate about making this film happen. Thank you!
リターンについて
お礼のはがきや一部のグッズに関しては、本作品終了後1ヶ月以内で発送予定です。
・エンドロールへのお名前掲載・映画DVDのご提供・映画出演権（エキストラ）・プロダクトプレイスメント（商品や店舗を映画内に）・プロデューサークレジット
現在、制作の初期段階にあります。撮影は12月から2週間かけて、インディーズスタイルで行う予定です。撮影を12月から始める理由としては、ミュージカルの要素である音楽の製作や、ダンスレッスンに多くの時間が必要となるからです。すでに録音してある1曲以外にも、他に4曲を製作・録音し、ダンサーやエキストラを選抜し稽古をしなければ、リハーサルやロケハンを進めることもできません。また、こうした制作準備を進める上で、資金調達が大変重要になってきます。スタジオのレンタルや録音、曲のエンジニアリングには莫大な費用がかかります。
わずかな金額でも、私たちが情熱を捧げるこの作品にとって大きな助けとなります。ぜひご協力いただければ幸いです。
本プロジェクトはAll-in方式で実施します。目標金額に満たない場合も、計画を実行し、リターンをお届けします。
日本中で話題になる美しいミュージカル映画を作りたいと思っています。

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">**New Stretch Goal: $15,000**</h3>
<p>We’re so excited to announce that in a little over two weeks we have raised $7,000 for The Phoenix! We are blown away by the generosity of this community and can’t thank you all enough for your support to get us to this milestone so soon into our campaign!</p>
<p>With 46 days left, we want to continue to build on this momentum by announcing our new fundraising goal of $15,000! This new stretch goal will help us take our film to the next level by contributing to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Animation</strong>: Creating an entirely original superhero cartoon is going to take a talented animation team to bring to life. Your continued support will allow us to hire a team of professionals who will  give “the Blue Phoenix” cartoon the polish and potency it needs to really pack a punch when it’s showcased in our film</li>
<li>
<strong>Production Design</strong>: To make Charlie’s family home fit the time period where the film takes place (late 90s to early 2000s), we will need to acquire furniture, props, and home decorations from this era. With additional funding, our team will be able to invest more into creating an authentic period setting, along with supplies and materials needed to age the house interior for the 2nd half of the film when Charlie is older</li>
<li>
<strong>Film Festivals</strong>: Your continued support means we will have the opportunity to submit the film to additional festivals across the country, which will not only broaden its exposure, but ensure that its empowering message can impact as many people as possible</li>
<li>
<strong>Increased Location Time</strong>: Time on location is a hurdle in the making of any film, and ours is no different. Meeting our new goal of $15,000 would allow us to increase our time spent on location to film, helping our cast and crew to bring you closer to the characters and world of the Phoenix</li>

<p>Inside a working class home in 90’s America, eight year old Charlie wants nothing more than to be a superhero. Her overworked parents are drifting apart, and their arguments just keep getting worse. Charlie’s only escape is her dream of being super.</p>
<p>Eventually, the toxicity around the house boils over, and Charlie watches as her mother throws a frying pan at her father. BAM! Charlie freezes time, her arms outstretched in a gesture of protest. She has finally unlocked her super power! Instinctively, Charlie discovers that she can not only stop time, but turn it back. </p>
<p>What unfolds is Charlie’s journey to realize that her powers are not the solution to solving the problems of her broken home. Rather, the strength to rise above this hardship, lies within herself.</p>

</div></div>","**Post-Production Stretch Goal: $25,000**
We're so grateful for the support from everyone who helped us reach our $15,000 stretch goal. Since then, we've shot the film in Arnold, CA, and are excited to announce our new fundraising goal of $25,000, which will cover our post-production expenses, including visual effects, marketing, and film festivals fees. 
To donate, select a perk on the right side that corresponds to the amount that you wish to contribute.

 
**New Stretch Goal: $15,000**
We’re so excited to announce that in a little over two weeks we have raised $7,000 for The Phoenix! We are blown away by the generosity of this community and can’t thank you all enough for your support to get us to this milestone so soon into our campaign!
With 46 days left, we want to continue to build on this momentum by announcing our new fundraising goal of $15,000! This new stretch goal will help us take our film to the next level by contributing to the following:


Animation: Creating an entirely original superhero cartoon is going to take a talented animation team to bring to life. Your continued support will allow us to hire a team of professionals who will  give “the Blue Phoenix” cartoon the polish and potency it needs to really pack a punch when it’s showcased in our film

Production Design: To make Charlie’s family home fit the time period where the film takes place (late 90s to early 2000s), we will need to acquire furniture, props, and home decorations from this era. With additional funding, our team will be able to invest more into creating an authentic period setting, along with supplies and materials needed to age the house interior for the 2nd half of the film when Charlie is older

Film Festivals: Your continued support means we will have the opportunity to submit the film to additional festivals across the country, which will not only broaden its exposure, but ensure that its empowering message can impact as many people as possible

Increased Location Time: Time on location is a hurdle in the making of any film, and ours is no different. Meeting our new goal of $15,000 would allow us to increase our time spent on location to film, helping our cast and crew to bring you closer to the characters and world of the Phoenix

 

 
Hello everyone! My name is Regina Pigsley and I’m a 24 year old writer and director from Northern California. My mission is to empower underrepresented female voices through filmmaking.

I’m working with a talented team of filmmakers to create The Phoenix, a story about a young girl, Charlie, who unexpectedly attains superpowers, and attempts to use those superpowers to fix her parents’ marriage. In order to bring Charlie’s story and powers to life, we need all the support we can get. By donating, you can be a part of my journey to empower the powerless. Any donation, no matter how small, gets us one step closer to making this film a reality.

<h3>Summary:</h3>
<p><i>Stand To</i> is a short film drama addressing the problem of PTSD. However, where most stories focus solely on the individual sufferer, typically a veteran, ‘Stand To’ flips the perspective to shed light on the wider issue - the impact PTSD has on the loved ones caught up in the mire. </p>
<p>The story follows Adrienne, and her struggle to help her boyfriend, Dean, adjust to life after the military. The complex nature of PTSD means this is a struggle fraught with difficulties, and quite often dangers, as Dean’s insecurity, paranoia and aggression leave Adrienne in a constant state of fear, anxiety and tragically, guilt. I have made every endeavour to make Adrienne and Dean’s story authentic.</p>
<p>As well as frequent discussions with the lead actor to create authentic dialogue, the experiences Adrienne endures are primarily drawn from the accounts of genuine partners of veterans from the following sources: </p>
<p><strong>‘Supporting my man through PTSD’ – <u><a href=""https://www.england.nhs.uk/blog/supporting-my-man/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.england.nhs.uk/blog/supporting-my-man/</a> </u></strong></p>
<p><strong>‘Coping with a veteran’s mental health issues’ – <u><a href=""https://www.england.nhs.uk/blog/coping-with-a-veterans-mental-health-issues/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.england.nhs.uk/blog/coping-with-a-v...</a> </u></strong></p>
<p><strong>‘6 things I learned from dating someone with PTSD’ – <u><a href=""https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/lessons-partner-with-PTSD"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health...</a> </u></strong></p>
<div><h3>Stand To's Impact</h3></div>
<div>
<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">It is these stories that highlight why ‘</span><i style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Stand To</i><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">’ is so important. The reality of PTSD is often overlooked, that for every veteran suffering, there are friends and family in the firing line. </span>
</div>
<p>The best way to make people realise and understand this broader issue is to address it as the serious problem that it is. Therefore the film’s tone is consistently dark and dramatic, driven by key issues including unpredictable emotions, borderline domestic abuse, and even suicide. It is deliberately unrelenting emotionally, intentionally unsettling and unapologetically shocking so as to convey the harsh reality that there are people who experience this as everyday life. This is what makes this film distinctive. All too often films addressing PTSD focus solely on the veteran, with their condition solely affecting them. This is not the case in ‘Stand To’, because it is not true. </p>
<p>Writer-Director Callum McKay's aim is to address this oversight to help generate greater awareness for the condition and consequently help both veterans and their loved ones. This is a unique approach to this kind of story, offering a fresh insight from a new perspective on an underrepresented issue. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Cast:</strong></h2>
<p><strong><i>Amy McCallum (for Adrienne)</i></strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1624224157/cbbxt5skjrjxtimjwljp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Amy’s current and prospective roles prove her positive trajectory as an actor portraying roles re-envisioning the modern British woman. Adrienne is an emotionally complex character, intelligent and headstrong, but ill-equipped to fight this unfamiliar, unsettling, almost dangerous situation she’s tasked herself with overcoming. Amy’s raw, gutsy performances in programmes such as <i>Holby City</i>, <i>Endeavour</i> and <i>White House Farm</i> show she’s perfectly suited to delivering an enthralling performance of this compelling young woman.</p>
<p><strong><i>Lee Lomas (for Dean)</i></strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1624224186/ffayov0ymvo0ghlwjzx7.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Lee has effectively executed a variety of roles across film and television where he has worked for over 10 years. This includes roles in <i>H</i><i>ollyoaks, Cold Feet, Coronation Street</i> and <i>Who is Alice</i>. He has featured in a number of different musicals and plays, such as<i> Killing Nana</i> and <i>Sunrise for the Blind</i> in 2019. A reflection of Lee’s high calibre acting experience, he is represented by the IAG talent agency which represents the very best actors to come out of the Identity School of Acting. Alumni of this school include BAFTA Rising Star recipients John Boyega and Letitia Wright.</p>
<p><strong><i>Hannah Hoad (for Steph)</i></strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1624224211/amffufanr75nczvomskh.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Hannah's past performances demonstrate she will be able to draw upon her experience of playing strong-minded characters to portray this supportive, but bluntly honest best friend. Both Adrienne and Steph are strong-willed individuals. Hannah has shown this is not unfamiliar territory for her, in her portrayal of characters in a range of the films such as <i>White Powder </i>and <i>Just For The Money</i>. Her ability to convey emotion through her reactions and expression rather than relying solely on dialogue is also clear to see in her role in Robbie Williams’ music video <i>Mixed Signals</i>. </p>
<p><i><strong>Elliot Cable (for Tom)</strong></i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1624224298/qfkfdpphidi9egzu9bew.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Elliot's performance in <i>Fair Trade</i> is what makes him such a strong candidate for the role of Tom, as it highlights Elliot’s skill at embodying a character who is lively, jovial, and who thrives on being the life and soul of the room. Yet he marries these traits with the important quality of conveying a natural chemistry with his co-stars, a trait that is crucial to the character of Tom.</p>

<p>Callum McKay is an award-winning screenwriter specialising in dramas and period screenplays. Through the consistently high standard of his work, Callum has created stories that explore the human condition with regards to human fragility and emotional turmoil, as well as thought provoking drama. This is exactly why some of his most promising screenplays have won awards both in the UK and America, such as ‘Dark Forces’, a category winner in the 2018 Hollywood Screenplay Contest, and ‘Miss Verity’, a finalist in the same competition and winner of the 2019 Raindance Live Ammunition Pitching Competition. Most recently, Callum’s work has attracted the attention of UK television channels with his first pilot script, ‘The Doghouse Club’, which was pitched to ITV and Channel 4 and praised for its writing quality.  Callum is currently working on a pilot for a new drama series, as well as a selection of short film scripts.</p>
<p>Although this is his first foray into directing for film, this is by no means his first project as a writer/director. As Head Writer for the Falmouth and Exeter Cornwall Campus Light Entertainment Society (FECCLES), Callum was the co-writer and director of the troupe’s show at the 2015 Edinburgh Festival, ‘Decaying with Grace’. </p>
<p>Stand To is the perfect project for him to take on a directing role. Not only is he dedicated to the project’s success as its writer-director, but his commitment to the message it conveys makes him ideally suited to realising his vision for the script on the screen. He is also mentored by a BAFTA-membered Film Director to ensure a successful directorial debut.</p>
<p><strong><i>Producer RANW ASO-RASHID</i></strong></p>
<p>Ranw is an award winning Producer who has produced multiple short films including the award-winning <i>Jane (Special Mention Award at LA International Short Films Fest),</i> and the BAFTA-screened <i>Dear Stranger. </i>Ranw utilises his background in teaching to facilitate work experience/mentoring programmes for young people from under-represented groups to help produce memorable stories. Ranw will work with Unit Production Manager Tolga Dundar (who coordinated production on <i>007 Skyfall</i>) to ensure a smooth production.</p>
<p><i><strong>Director of Photography ASH CONNAUGHTON</strong></i></p>
<p>Ash Connaughton is highly experienced in a wide range of production scales, styles and genres. Ash has shot drama narratives, documentaries, music videos as well as branded content and commercials; working for clients such as BBC, Warner Bros. and M&amp;C Saatchi. </p>
<p>Ash was Cinematographer on award winning pieces such as the short neo noir <i>Lo Selezinero</i>, feature documentary <i>Tax Shelter Terrors </i>and Feature Film <i>Hello Darlin</i>.</p>

Stand To is a short film drama addressing the problem of PTSD. However, where most stories focus solely on the individual sufferer, typically a veteran, ‘Stand To’ flips the perspective to shed light on the wider issue - the impact PTSD has on the loved ones caught up in the mire. 
The story follows Adrienne, and her struggle to help her boyfriend, Dean, adjust to life after the military. The complex nature of PTSD means this is a struggle fraught with difficulties, and quite often dangers, as Dean’s insecurity, paranoia and aggression leave Adrienne in a constant state of fear, anxiety and tragically, guilt. I have made every endeavour to make Adrienne and Dean’s story authentic.
As well as frequent discussions with the lead actor to create authentic dialogue, the experiences Adrienne endures are primarily drawn from the accounts of genuine partners of veterans from the following sources: 
‘Supporting my man through PTSD’ – https://www.england.nhs.uk/blog/supporting-my-man/ 
‘Coping with a veteran’s mental health issues’ – https://www.england.nhs.uk/blog/coping-with-a-v... 
‘6 things I learned from dating someone with PTSD’ – https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health... 
Stand To's Impact

It is these stories that highlight why ‘Stand To’ is so important. The reality of PTSD is often overlooked, that for every veteran suffering, there are friends and family in the firing line. 

The best way to make people realise and understand this broader issue is to address it as the serious problem that it is. Therefore the film’s tone is consistently dark and dramatic, driven by key issues including unpredictable emotions, borderline domestic abuse, and even suicide. It is deliberately unrelenting emotionally, intentionally unsettling and unapologetically shocking so as to convey the harsh reality that there are people who experience this as everyday life. This is what makes this film distinctive. All too often films addressing PTSD focus solely on the veteran, with their condition solely affecting them. This is not the case in ‘Stand To’, because it is not true. 
Writer-Director Callum McKay's aim is to address this oversight to help generate greater awareness for the condition and consequently help both veterans and their loved ones. This is a unique approach to this kind of story, offering a fresh insight from a new perspective on an underrepresented issue. 
 
Cast:
Amy McCallum (for Adrienne)

Amy’s current and prospective roles prove her positive trajectory as an actor portraying roles re-envisioning the modern British woman. Adrienne is an emotionally complex character, intelligent and headstrong, but ill-equipped to fight this unfamiliar, unsettling, almost dangerous situation she’s tasked herself with overcoming. Amy’s raw, gutsy performances in programmes such as Holby City, Endeavour and White House Farm show she’s perfectly suited to delivering an enthralling performance of this compelling young woman.
Lee Lomas (for Dean)

Lee has effectively executed a variety of roles across film and television where he has worked for over 10 years. This includes roles in Hollyoaks, Cold Feet, Coronation Street and Who is Alice. He has featured in a number of different musicals and plays, such as Killing Nana and Sunrise for the Blind in 2019. A reflection of Lee’s high calibre acting experience, he is represented by the IAG talent agency which represents the very best actors to come out of the Identity School of Acting. Alumni of this school include BAFTA Rising Star recipients John Boyega and Letitia Wright.
Hannah Hoad (for Steph)

Hannah's past performances demonstrate she will be able to draw upon her experience of playing strong-minded characters to portray this supportive, but bluntly honest best friend. Both Adrienne and Steph are strong-willed individuals. Hannah has shown this is not unfamiliar territory for her, in her portrayal of characters in a range of the films such as White Powder and Just For The Money. Her ability to convey emotion through her reactions and expression rather than relying solely on dialogue is also clear to see in her role in Robbie Williams’ music video Mixed Signals. 
Elliot Cable (for Tom)

Elliot's performance in Fair Trade is what makes him such a strong candidate for the role of Tom, as it highlights Elliot’s skill at embodying a character who is lively, jovial, and who thrives on being the life and soul of the room. Yet he marries these traits with the important quality of conveying a natural chemistry with his co-stars, a trait that is crucial to the character of Tom.
Crew:
Writer-Director CALLUM MCKAY

Callum McKay is an award-winning screenwriter specialising in dramas and period screenplays. Through the consistently high standard of his work, Callum has created stories that explore the human condition with regards to human fragility and emotional turmoil, as well as thought provoking drama. This is exactly why some of his most promising screenplays have won awards both in the UK and America, such as ‘Dark Forces’, a category winner in the 2018 Hollywood Screenplay Contest, and ‘Miss Verity’, a finalist in the same competition and winner of the 2019 Raindance Live Ammunition Pitching Competition. Most recently, Callum’s work has attracted the attention of UK television channels with his first pilot script, ‘The Doghouse Club’, which was pitched to ITV and Channel 4 and praised for its writing quality.  Callum is currently working on a pilot for a new drama series, as well as a selection of short film scripts.
Although this is his first foray into directing for film, this is by no means his first project as a writer/director. As Head Writer for the Falmouth and Exeter Cornwall Campus Light Entertainment Society (FECCLES), Callum was the co-writer and director of the troupe’s show at the 2015 Edinburgh Festival, ‘Decaying with Grace’. 
Stand To is the perfect project for him to take on a directing role. Not only is he dedicated to the project’s success as its writer-director, but his commitment to the message it conveys makes him ideally suited to realising his vision for the script on the screen. He is also mentored by a BAFTA-membered Film Director to ensure a successful directorial debut.
Producer RANW ASO-RASHID
Ranw is an award winning Producer who has produced multiple short films including the award-winning Jane (Special Mention Award at LA International Short Films Fest), and the BAFTA-screened Dear Stranger. Ranw utilises his background in teaching to facilitate work experience/mentoring programmes for young people from under-represented groups to help produce memorable stories. Ranw will work with Unit Production Manager Tolga Dundar (who coordinated production on 007 Skyfall) to ensure a smooth production.
Director of Photography ASH CONNAUGHTON
Ash Connaughton is highly experienced in a wide range of production scales, styles and genres. Ash has shot drama narratives, documentaries, music videos as well as branded content and commercials; working for clients such as BBC, Warner Bros. and M&C Saatchi. 
Ash was Cinematographer on award winning pieces such as the short neo noir Lo Selezinero, feature documentary Tax Shelter Terrors and Feature Film Hello Darlin.
 
What We Need & What You Get


In line with our funding strategy, we're seeking a specific amount of £5,000 to be raised from crowdfunding which will cover equipment rental, insurances, location fees, cast/crew expenses, post-production costs, production design, composing the score, marketing and unit publicity fees. It would also help ensure our project staff can be fairly compensated for the work they do.
The idea behind the perks is that the more you invest in the film, the more involved you are with its production and the more rewarded you are as we have tried to make the perks reasonable and attractive.

 
Risks & Challenges
People value your transparency. Be open and stand out by providing insight into the risks and obstacles you may face on the way to achieving your goal.

This is a challenging film to make - both technically and creatively. However, the calibre of talent of our cast and crew will ensure a naturalistic and outstanding performance on screen.
We have some of the industry's most experienced Head of Departments (HODs) on this project. Their combined experience numbers several hundred projects ranging from shorts to feature films in the UK and overseas. Some of our HODs have led in their departments on BAFTA/Academy Award nominated/winning films. Some of our HODs have also led on BFI-funded films. 
Our HODs will be in constant communication with one another, liaising on all technical/creative processes as required.

Young members of our crew, who are up-and-coming, are being mentored by industry-leading film/TV professionals in their respective departments. This will ensure their professional development and mentorship. This will impacts on the smooth running of the production and help address industry under-representation.
We are a COVID-compliant production with a thorough risk assessment of all aspects of the production, ensuring that all staff remain safe. This includes effective safeguarding procedures in place for school-age children completing supervised work placements/mentorship programmes.

<p><i>Swimming with Stones</i> to me is not just a tribute to masterful long takes in cinematography, but also a mosaic of memories, colors, and visuals that represent what grief and its weight feel like to me. Everyone will lose someone at some point in life. The goal of my film is to reach anyone who has or is currently experiencing the process of grief. </p>

A mother relives memories of her daughter on the one year anniversary of her daughter's death.
 
The Story
Swimming with Stones is a short film from director-cinematographer Amber Yang and producer Jacqueline Thom, based on the personal experiences with loss from Amber and writer Hannah Baynes.
The story will follow a mother’s journey of going through grief. She comes to a realization that unloading the weight doesn’t mean leaving the memories behind.
Swimming with Stones is a tribute to those who are no longer with us and the topic of dealing with grief. It will be shot in long takes on a women-led crew.  
We are also dedicated to achieving a Green Production Certification, meaning our shoot is environmentally responsible.
 
Meet The Team
Amber Yang, Director-Cinematographer
Amber is a filmmaker and graphic designer. She received her Media Arts BFA and Graphic Design minor from Northeastern University. Her primary focuses are cinematography and graphic design, using her art to connect to others.
 
Note from the Director
Swimming with Stones to me is not just a tribute to masterful long takes in cinematography, but also a mosaic of memories, colors, and visuals that represent what grief and its weight feel like to me. Everyone will lose someone at some point in life. The goal of my film is to reach anyone who has or is currently experiencing the process of grief. 
My hope is that perhaps Swimming with Stones could offer some insight or serve as a lighthouse in the seemingly never-ending storm of grief. It is not to say that there may be an end to grief, but that getting and feeling better and lighter at the end of a long tunnel is possible.

<h3>The Story:</h3>
<p>In the time of the American Civil War, a Captain in the Union Army wanders the hills of western North Carolina, hopelessly lost and fatigued having just narrowly escaped a bloody battle with his life. As he wanders through the deep, dark, mysterious woods, strange things start happening to him that leave him questioning his own sanity until he runs into Maggie, a pretty young hill-dwelling woman who takes pity on him and brings him to a nearby cabin where she lives with her father. The Captain thinks he is finally ""out of the woods"" little does he know his troubles are just beginning. </p>
<p>This is a ghost story about witchcraft in the southern Appalachian mountains, more specifically western North Carolina. While not as well accounted as the stories of witchcraft in New England or elsewhere in America, these still very wild and deeply forested hills were the perfect breeding ground for superstition, the supernatural and unimaginable evil. </p>
<p>Death comes in three's..""The Third Night"" is in reference to the common theme of the number 3 in superstition or bad omens. For example if one were to see an owl peering into the window of a house that would be considered a bad omen. But if the owl returned three nights in a row, death would be sure to soon follow on the third night.</p>

<h3>Statement from the Director:</h3>
<p>This project is one that has been in the works for a few years now, I have been chipping away at it here and there, writing or doing research. I really gained headway and got the project to a place where I felt I was actually able to shoot it over the lockdown last summer/fall and here we are, it's actually happening, the wheels are in motion the only thing left is the $$$! But this part should be easy, I know I have enough friends, family, and supporters out there that believe in me and the work that I do that are willing to throw a few bucks my way. This is a text book passion project, and I can honestly say I have never been more passionate about something, hence why I have invested so much of my time into it already. I can honestly say without any hesitation that this will be the best thing I have ever made, and the most personal, the most reflective of who I am as a person. So if you would like to find out what that looks like, I implore you to consider donating. Thank you so much! </p>

Statement from the Director:
This project is one that has been in the works for a few years now, I have been chipping away at it here and there, writing or doing research. I really gained headway and got the project to a place where I felt I was actually able to shoot it over the lockdown last summer/fall and here we are, it's actually happening, the wheels are in motion the only thing left is the $$$! But this part should be easy, I know I have enough friends, family, and supporters out there that believe in me and the work that I do that are willing to throw a few bucks my way. This is a text book passion project, and I can honestly say I have never been more passionate about something, hence why I have invested so much of my time into it already. I can honestly say without any hesitation that this will be the best thing I have ever made, and the most personal, the most reflective of who I am as a person. So if you would like to find out what that looks like, I implore you to consider donating. Thank you so much!

<h3>The Film</h3>
<p>Our run-time target is roughly 20 minutes, with the average sketch being about 3 minutes in length.  We’ve already shot the entire mockumentary portion, consisting of interviews with ‘Blake’, and one of the five sketches.  We’re targeting an early November date to shoot our second sketch, with the bulk of any crowdfunding money raised going to the final three.</p>
<p>Without giving too much away, the final three sketches contain, broadly, a gruesome shootout, space travel, and some wacky time travel shit, so they’ll involve bigger casts, more complex costumes and sets, and, of course, special effects.  Practically every dollar we receive beyond our target will be poured into polishing those three things (hell, if we raise a million, we’ll just render a fully CG dog).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>We’re asking for $7,500 because that’s what we approximate it will take to finish the scrappiest version of the movie we can whittle down.  That means cutting some scenes, settling for cheaper effects, maybe just even having a guy in a dog suit. With approximately $10,000, we’re confident we can come much closer to our vision, and every dollar beyond that just makes it a safer bet.</p>
<h3>The Rewards</h3>
<p>In addition to digital and physical copies of the film, backers will have the opportunity to meet and hang with the creative team and even visit the set!  </p>
<p>Of special note: IF AND ONLY IF you've got a fully grown Saint Bernard (that looks like the Beethoven dog... like it isn't albino or whatever) and we coordinate you bringing it to set on the days we're shooting, your dog will be in the film and you get the full FULL ZOOMY for free.  Just reach out to us and let us know!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Team</h3>
<p><strong>Kendrick Reinsch</strong>, the fellow in the video above, stars as Blake Cadwell, disgraced Hollywood entrepreneur.  At the New York University Tisch School of the Arts, Kendrick mastered the Strasberg method of acting, which, evidently, involves cramming lines ten minutes before a shoot while nursing a hangover (poorly).   </p>
<p><strong>Alyssa Kurtzman</strong>, also a graduate of NYU’s esteemed Tisch school, is our director.  As her final film at Tisch, Alyssa wrote, directed, and produced <a href=""https://vimeo.com/10223884"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Matrix: The Musical</a>, which, if you watch closely, features a younger, less broken, Kendrick.  Since college, Alyssa has been producing all kinds of (impeccably shot and edited) videos that you’ve probably seen pop up on your social media feeds as Head of Production for Branded Content at Group Nine--including <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/101800100890/posts/749389508730771"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this video</a> also featuring our star.</p>
<p><strong>Kris Rey-Talley</strong>, who’s known Kendrick and Alyssa since their Tisch days, brings the equipment and technical expertise and is why we’re able to shoot this thing in wholly inappropriate, entirely superfluous, kind of unflattering, and grossly inefficient 4K high definition.  Like Alyssa and Evan, but unlike Kendrick and Sal, Kris has spent his time since college churning out high quality content <a href=""https://www.krisreytalley.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">that you can check out here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Evan Cutler Wattles</strong>, will be editing the film and, like Alyssa and Kris, is yet another filmmaker way too competent to be working on this project.  He actually edited our pitch video and even let us use his tiny dog. <a href=""http://www.silentface.net/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Here’s a link to his stuff</a>.</p>
<p><strong>A. Salao </strong>wrote this thing.  He has no other credits to his name and has, generally, never contributed anything of value to our cultural marketplace of ideas.  He also has no clue how he convinced all of these people he met in college to work on this weirdo project. If you like his dog movie, ask him about all of his way worse ideas that the rest of the team wisely rejected.</p>
<p>Please note that while most of us met in, and are alumni of, New York University, we’re not in any way sponsored or otherwise funded by the school… yet.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Risks</h3>
<p>Thankfully, most of the project (at least measured by runtime) is essentially done, and we’ve nailed down shooting locations for the remaining scenes.  So, the second biggest risk in not being able to finish this movie in a timely manner comes from the fact that all of the people actually shooting this thing (and some of the people being shot) know what they’re doing and are usually paid to do what they do.  We’re doing our best to coordinate, but since everyone’s working for free (and they still have rent to pay), timing the relatively few number of shoots we have left might be subject to delays as paying gigs hurl members of our team across the world.</p>
<p>The first biggest risk comes from finding an actual Saint Bernard.  But we’re working on it! Only the three scenes we’ve saved for last feature a dog, so we won’t need one for a bit of time--we’re actively searching and appreciate any leads!</p>
