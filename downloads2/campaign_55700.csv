</div>","Eco-friendly properties:  One Oxy-Water Bottle replaces dozens of disposable plastic bottles and reduces the amount of nonbiodegradable waste

Capacity: One Oxy-Water Bottle holds up to 0.6 liter


Speed: One Oxy-Water Bottle needs only 3 minutes to produce an oxygenated drink 


Other properties: One Oxy-Water Bottle can do both, cool and heat


Bonus: A powerbank with each device

Simple Design: Compact, ergonomical and functional
The Oxygen Concentrator Power Oxygen extracts the gas from air and dissolves it in water afterwards. The operational principle of the bottle is simple and does not require much energy. On the molecular level the concentrator squeezes air and divides it into nitrogen and oxygen. This division is made possible due to a zeolite column that is built into the bottle. The zeolite crystal has a complex branched net of minute pore spaces that can withhold particles no bigger than 0.3 micron. After nitrogen and other gases are separated, the concentrated oxygen is dissolved in water.  Power Oxygen purifies water up to 97-99%. The service life of a zeolite crystal amounts to 20 thousand hours minimum, which makes up as much as 10 years of work.

Oxygenated water is potable water which is saturated with extra oxygen and, as a result, contains two or three times increased amount of it. Such water heightens productivity, neutralizes the negative consequences of an unbalanced lifestyle and egests toxins and wastes. Such water is greatly popular with people doing a lot of sport or/and exerting work. It is also very   good for elderly people and children.It is a kind of life-giving drink that provides our bodies with extra oxygen. Its application has neither restrictions nor bounds.Oxygenated water supplies body cells with more oxygen and facilitates metabolism. Water in mountain springs and streams is believed to contain far more oxygen than tap water, being so to speak natural oxygenated water. People in mountain valleys may live longer because they drink such water.​​​



It prevents hypoxia and anoxia
It improves metabolism
It egests toxins and wastes
It heightens brain productivity
It prevents the lack of fruit-sugar in blood
It helps to regenerate skin sores and heal wounds and injuries
It improves the performance of the gastrointestinal tract
It improves the immune system
It heightens potency
It inhibits the process of ageing
It improves sleep



It facilitates recovery after strenuous physical work
It egests muscle lactic acid and relieves pain
It improves stamina
It contributes to weight loss
It improves your vital tonus and, as a result, your mood

With Power Oxygen one can make oxygenated water only in 3 minutes. Besides, the bottle can be used to make vitamin-fortified drinks: just add some chopped fruit to the water in your bottle!
While preparing an oxygenated drink, a bottle can cool the liquid up to 10ºC (50ºF). The content of oxygenated water is akin to that of a mountain spring.
In case some heating is needed, the bottle can warm up any drink – be it water, tea or coffee – in just 3 minutes up to 70ºC (160ºF).

I am licensed professional counselor and  a marriage family therapist who specializes in working with adoptive families and with parents who have very challenging children. I have developed, with the help of other professionals, an intensive in-home program to bring safety and health back into families torn apart by destructive behaviors.  I have also had over ten years experience running camps for at risk children and youth. I am passionate about helping parents do everything they can to keep their children at home in a safe and secure environment. I am especially passionate about working with adoptive families who are struggling with behaviors related to attachment disorders and complex trauma. In a camp setting my team will have the unique opportunity to bring parenting skills to parents while we also provide therapy enriched activities to the siblings and the adoptive child(ren).  September 2016 will be our first camp of this nature and our hope is to not only have a Family First Camp every year but build a camp paradigm that will duplicated and widely used. </p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>In order to launch our first camp September 2016 we need start up funding to secure the camp facility for 10 families and up to 40 volunteers.  After our initial camp we are confident that the camps will be self sustaining.

We also face the challenge of getting the word out to families and helping them to secure the funding to attend. We are currently in the process of interviewing and training the volunteers needed to put on a camp that sensitive to the needs and challenges each family will bring. Our team is made up of three counselors including myself and a handful of seasoned volunteers from a camping network called Royal Family Kids Camp (an international camping program for foster children).

<p>My name is Victoria Leveque, I am a current student at the
University of Miami majoring in Economics and minoring in French and finance. I
am writing you today because Mikaila Ulmer’s beverage company has inspired me
to come up with my own company. You see I am from Haiti and ever since I could
remember, I always wanted to do something that would make people explore the
Haitian culture and also bring some kind of positivity in Haiti, so I came up
with a perfect idea. In our culture there is this Jam in Haiti we call it
“Confiture”. The confiture is a 100 percent organic made with the pulp of a
grapefruit and other tropical fruits mix with other ingredients. I want to
build my company by exporting this product from Haiti to the United States and
hopefully around the world. My mother and I came up with this idea and we have
not only one flavor but also multiple. I looked all over supermarkets and have
not yet seen this product. In the future I see my product in wholefood and many
more grocery stores. With my company, people will have a taste of the Haitian
culture and the Haitian people will have a place to work. Please let me know
what you think about my idea. I will love to have a meeting with you so you can
also have taste of the “Confitures”. You will not be disappointed.</p>

The product will be created in Haiti. The reason behind is that the more jobs that Haiti can provide the better for the people because they can stop focusing on creating violence in the country and start focus on making money to take care of their love ones. The factory will only have Haitians that knows how to cook and that are in need of a job. Like I said before my goal is to open people's eyes to the Haitian culture and try to put more Haitian product out there in the US. <p>With that being said I believe that Haitian confiture is something that people outside of Haiti have yet tasted. Yes it is similar to  american Jam but it's made out of completely different ingredients. I honestly feel like it is better than most Jams at the grocery stores. </p><p>I believe to start this campaign, I will need 10,000 dollars for the startup because I need to build a factory to make the Jams. Right now we have people making it manually which makes this process very slow. I think the factory will allow us to sell the product in big quantity to different states in aAmerica. Help me turn this idea into an accomplishment. This product can become the new peanut butter and jelly but instead of jelly it will have Confiture Chadeque. </p></div>","To Whom It May Concern:

Like I said before my goal is to open people's eyes to the Haitian culture and try to put more Haitian product out there in the US. With that being said I believe that Haitian confiture is something that people outside of Haiti have yet tasted. Yes it is similar to  american Jam but it's made out of completely different ingredients. I honestly feel like it is better than most Jams at the grocery stores. I believe to start this campaign, I will need 10,000 dollars for the startup because I need to build a factory to make the Jams. Right now we have people making it manually which makes this process very slow. I think the factory will allow us to sell the product in big quantity to different states in aAmerica. Help me turn this idea into an accomplishment. This product can become the new peanut butter and jelly but instead of jelly it will have Confiture Chadeque.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Here is a simple Breakdown for how our fundraising will work:<br/></p>
<ul>
<li> For every light you buy, we will donate a light to a country where electricity does not exist or is scarce. <br/>

southern Asia.<br/><br/>Can you imagine if we could donate the 1.5 billion simple lights to all those people? I know it seems like a long shot but its definitely possible to touch that number with your help.<br/>

<p>B-style yoga is not your mommas yoga plain and simple.I'm not your average yogi either. I am not afraid to take risks on my own to help someone else reach their highest potential. I have been working the mat since I am 13yrs old my teachers extremely  unorthodox (  exactly why In am the same)  taught me yoga was a moving meditation that be used to heal or create, manifest or break down walls. It is a way to shut the ego up long enough for the spirit your soul to come through and work on the physical plain in the wet suit we call our bodies. I was taught every modalitiy of religions, metaphysical practices and spiritual connections to help me communicate with everyone I come in contact with in a way in which they resonate in truth with. I have been known to get the newest student to hold a CROW pose and the most seasoned yogi rethink their approach to a handstand. I have been able to hold the attention of 50 plus students in a heated room and make them leave knowing each others name because we all worked together to create the class, mind you this was a weekly class and happen more frequently then not. I have also over the years knew I was intuitive, ESP I do not like the word Psychic has I feel it limits the gifts of what this mind can do and see. I have worked with my gifts including healing with hands and voice and put it together with my passion for yoga and all the hidden knowledge I have about the practice itself . That is why B-style yoga was developed and needs a home. I need a space that is multi roomed so there can be meditation and meditation rocking at the same time. A space that is free for people to come in a chill, meditate, read or just be with a cutoff tea and some warm friendly energy. There has to be room for Aerial Hammocks for floating guided meditation and some flips if the work calls for it. warm and non warm rooms for different practices. A big closet to house all the Dhrama wheels , handstand canes, mats, bolsters, block, bands, you name it because I use all , including barres and bosu balls they are huge need space to play on them as well. For me I  use every tool , prop piece of equipment I can get my hands on to help someone achieve the fullest expression of a pose they can. </p>
<p>B-style yoga works with healing. Most of my privates have some sort of challenge physically , mentally and emotionally that has blocked them from their connection to their divinty and power. By sequentially linking poses together like a puzzle I can create a specific indivualized practice that helps the student access their power and connection on all 4 bodies to remove traumas. I  cannot make someone walk at least not yet however that being will feel power strength and  connect to courage to see life and their challenges as oppurtunities.  I work with all ages and all challenges from ADHD helping children and teens ween off meds by introducing them to a couple of poses that they can manage alone. I use crystals and other proffesional in the field to aid in the advancement of healing. I want to expand and create a out reach program which Whispering Mantra studios will essentially be home base for . Bring B-style yoga and all its props to Clinic, Hospices, Senior Homes, Hospitals Rehabs you name it without cost to them. </p>
<p>My life has not been easy but is has been fabulous. The past I have owned successful business and have worked for some amazing people . All this has lead to here, over the course of 5 yrs and my own challeneges physically myself 2014'15 I had two serious Cervical spine surgeries that have left me with painful complications. I am single mom always have been so the buck stops here. Myself and my son met family distractions and traumas that we went through and have come out the other side more aware and far more connected. This  is why I am asking for  your contribution . The bank account suffered the storm and normally opening a new business would have been as easy as opening the check book. This where my next lesson would be taught , That is to dare to show vulnerability by starting this campaign this project and reach out to the community to help. So here I am at 52 yrs old ready to put my talk to work . I can now truly connect to so many on so many issues that you do not need tissues . See I am the living example of my B-style Practice. I know addiction in a family, know life threatening events, I know and connect to having the rug shift underneath you and wake up in a whole new ball game. I can resonate there for I can work on the what you expierence because I might know first hand myself. My intuitive gift and healing work on the whole as well So when walk into one of my class you really do feel at home and like we have known each other forever , because we have. Whispering Mantra yoga studios is the home and playground for B-style yoga and we , I plan on growing and expanding and coming to a planet near you. Thank you for your time , I know what the capital to build this studio can do I know what it means I can see it clearly . I hope this snapshot into my world, head and vision leaves you wanting to be the reason it manifests. Then you can come and play with all of us , rock that mat!!!! XO b </p>
<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p>In being as transparent as possible, I will say that I'm not worried about competition because I know my practice is unique. However, I will have to focus heavily on PR and marketing in order to grow my practice and reach out to communities. Purchasing the proper equipment and finding the perfect central  location to create a studio and a team that will allow me to travel to   take my practice on the road.</p>
<p>The other challenge is my own time constraints. I'll be looking to mentor others to assist in my practice with me so I can continue to grow and serve more people.</p>

The final cost include The transportation fees will be 119 $  .LINA PAC consume 34 watt/hr compared with traditional air conditioner which has minimum power consumption 800 watt/hr , you can take LINA PAC with you where are you going but it is difficult to take the traditional air conditioner with you , Lina PAC wash
the air by the dry ice fog , so you will  smell the air like after the rain , Lina PAC does
not have air filter or evaporator coil like in traditional air conditioner
which consider focus of bacteria and virus ,Honey , mint oil
, olive oil , table salt and lemon droplets 
can be watered down in the base tank and inhaled through the air stream
for improve our healthy life.
If we don't reach the entire goal , we will manufacture according to what we will gain.

   
LINA PAC is portable and very easy to use.
LINA PAC is 100% eco-friendly.
Costs 1 US dollar and 22 cents for electricity monthly (for 20 hr operation per day)

Can work in  closed rooms or open area with no increase in relative humidity.                     advantages of Lina PAC

Reduce
temperature in dry weather from 35 C to 16 C
Reduce
temperature in wet weather from 32 C & 70% R.H to 24 C
Consume 34
watt/hr electricity ,for 20 hour operation per day for one  month you will pay 1.22 $
Lina PAC does
not have air filter or evaporator coil like in traditional air conditioner
which consider focus of bacteria and virus
Lina PAC does
not dry the air like in traditional air conditioner
Lina PAC does not
increase the humidity in the space
Lina PAC washes the air by the dry ice fog , so you will  smell the air like after the rain
Honey , mint oil
, olive oil , table salt and lemon droplets 
can be watered down in the base tank and inhaled through the air stream
for improve our healthy life
Lina PAC coefficient
of performance is 7 compared with the traditional air conditioner  which not more than 3

Our design have
been done through the psychometric chart  so we are achieved the sufficient amount of
air and the amount of dry ice fog 
required to cool the person , So 34 watt not 10 watt or 1.5 watt is sufficient amount of power consumption
need  for cool the person.

The capacity of
the main tank 2 liter of water which will sufficient to seven hours continues
operation.



   




LINA PAC uses “ceramic diaphragm pump” technology which uses nanotechnology to break water into tiny droplets approximately 3 microns in size turning it into dry ice fog (similar to the fog produced from a freezer) which in turn increases the surface area in contact with air. So by passing air over this fog you obtain 7 times the cooling energy resulting from changing water to ice.

















Adding Honey, mint or lemon droplets may help in the treatment of the following cases:

1. Getting rid of migraine. (mint oil)2. Reduce the rate of snoring. (honey and mint)3. Reduce the level of glucose in blood. (by adding honey)4. Treat asthma and sinuses. (Honey and mint)5. Repellent of mosquitoes and insects. (mint oil & lemon)6. Increase mental alertness and focus by 28%. (mint oil)7. Inhaling lemon decrease chances of getting cancer.8. Reduce elevated blood pressure in hypertensive patients.(honey)

<p><b>About My Project</b></p>
<p>I live in Singapore where personal
mobility devices like motorized scooters and electric bicycles are very
popular. However, these devices are mostly designed for a single person and
very fun-focused. So I designed and built a four-wheeled mobility pad so that
it can be used for many applications.</p>
<p>I call this device the <b>MoPad</b>
(Mobility + Pad).</p>
<p>It is operated by one person and is designed to carry 2 adults
or loads up to 200kg.</p>
<p>Also I enjoy building things and one of the main reason for me
is to design and build a device that can benefit many people if they were made
more popular. For example, there are many elderly wheelchair user requiring
care takers to push them around, workers needing to push trolleys with their
equipment and documents at work and buyers pushing shopping trolleys in
supermarkets; this is very inefficient.</p>
<p>I wish to start mass production for this device so it can be
made popular for use by everyone. Therefore I seek your support for funding!</p>
<p><b>Presentation</b></p>
<p>The <b>MoPad</b> is a
motorized mobility device designed to be used as a heavy duty vehicle. It is a
very practical and useful motorized device which can be readily used to convert
manual mobility devices such as wheelchairs, trolleys, golf carts into
motorized ones without any modification made to the existing device. There is a
lot of potential application for this device. It has four wheels and designed
to be narrow enough for bicycle paths and still be stable when turning. It can
function with an operator standing at the back or a used in seating position on
the main pad. It has four anchor points with fastening harness to secure
anything placed onto the pad. It is also fitted with 500 watt motors and speed
restricted to be slow at 18km/hr (speed can be further reduced) to provide
adequate power to facilitate movement of people and things but not to go too
fast.</p>
<p><b>Technical Data</b></p>
<p><strong>Length: </strong>120cm<span> <b>                      Width: </b>60cm<br/>
<b>Height (Adjustable HandleBar):</b> 80
- 130cm</span> <br/>
<b><span>Height (Platform): </span></b>22.5cm<br/>
<strong>Weight: </strong>35kg                              <b>Wheel: </b>8 inch tires<br/>
<b>Motor<strong><span>: </span></strong></b>500W electric              <b>Max Load:</b> 200kg<br/>
<b>Range: </b>40km                              <b>Speed: </b>18km/h (with
motor)<br/>
</p>
<p>As there are many existing manual mobility
devices user around, the <b>MoPad</b> will
be about to enable them with motorized power instantly! I think my mobility pad
concept will appeal to many more people across sectors. I hope that by getting <b>MoPad</b> into mass production, it will
greatly benefit everyone!</p>
<p><b>Planned
actions</b>
</p><p><span>Upon reaching $120 000
I will assemble a team to begin mass production.</span></p>
<p><b>Risks and problems</b></p>
<p>It is a complex product and quite many of the parts have to be
specially manufactured.<br/>
My job is to design, make and document the parts but I have no experience in mass production.<br/>
I'm the only fully dedicated team member today.<br/>
I do not have any big resources so if I for some reason must
end the project, it is not certain that I can repay all contributions.<br/>
The rules on electric devices differs from country to country, and some places
do not allow 4 wheeled motorized devices.<br/>
I am convinced that I can put together a good team and solve these
difficulties and make a great <b>MoPad</b>.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>

</div>","About My Project
I live in Singapore where personal
mobility devices like motorized scooters and electric bicycles are very
popular. However, these devices are mostly designed for a single person and
very fun-focused. So I designed and built a four-wheeled mobility pad so that
it can be used for many applications.
I call this device the MoPad
(Mobility + Pad).
It is operated by one person and is designed to carry 2 adults
or loads up to 200kg.
Also I enjoy building things and one of the main reason for me
is to design and build a device that can benefit many people if they were made
more popular. For example, there are many elderly wheelchair user requiring
care takers to push them around, workers needing to push trolleys with their
equipment and documents at work and buyers pushing shopping trolleys in
supermarkets; this is very inefficient.
I wish to start mass production for this device so it can be
made popular for use by everyone. Therefore I seek your support for funding!
Presentation
The MoPad is a
motorized mobility device designed to be used as a heavy duty vehicle. It is a
very practical and useful motorized device which can be readily used to convert
manual mobility devices such as wheelchairs, trolleys, golf carts into
motorized ones without any modification made to the existing device. There is a
lot of potential application for this device. It has four wheels and designed
to be narrow enough for bicycle paths and still be stable when turning. It can
function with an operator standing at the back or a used in seating position on
the main pad. It has four anchor points with fastening harness to secure
anything placed onto the pad. It is also fitted with 500 watt motors and speed
restricted to be slow at 18km/hr (speed can be further reduced) to provide
adequate power to facilitate movement of people and things but not to go too
fast.
Technical Data
Length: 120cm                       Width: 60cm
Height (Adjustable HandleBar): 80
- 130cm 
Height (Platform): 22.5cm
Weight: 35kg                              Wheel: 8 inch tires
Motor: 500W electric              Max Load: 200kg
Range: 40km                              Speed: 18km/h (with
motor)

As there are many existing manual mobility
devices user around, the MoPad will
be about to enable them with motorized power instantly! I think my mobility pad
concept will appeal to many more people across sectors. I hope that by getting MoPad into mass production, it will
greatly benefit everyone!
Planned
actions
Upon reaching $120 000
I will assemble a team to begin mass production.
Risks and problems
It is a complex product and quite many of the parts have to be
specially manufactured.
My job is to design, make and document the parts but I have no experience in mass production.
I'm the only fully dedicated team member today.
I do not have any big resources so if I for some reason must
end the project, it is not certain that I can repay all contributions.
The rules on electric devices differs from country to country, and some places
do not allow 4 wheeled motorized devices.
I am convinced that I can put together a good team and solve these
difficulties and make a great MoPad.

<p>Ever wondered why that, when you need a flashlight it's nowhere to be found, and when it is, its battery's dead? </p>
<p>We asked the same question to many people, and the answer we found was that a flashlight doesn't have a place to be stored nor is remembered until you need it. That's why we focused in making a very small flashlight, to allow you to store it easily were it counts, without robbing space. You can store it in your car's glove compartment, trunk or, at your house, inside the electrical cabinet, inside your closet, near the dog leash... wherever it suits you better.</p>

<h3>Where we come from</h3>
<p>Hey supporters.  My name is Ben.  I've been a runner my whole life.  Whether it was training for the soccer season as a teen or preparing for obstacle course races like Spartan or BattleFrog, I have learned to love the runner's high.  </p>
<p>Finding the right gear is essential to success in any endeavor.  As I searched for the right way to carry my stuff around while running, I grew tired of paying through the nose for name brand gear that didn't get the job done.  I had to carry my phone in my hand and tie my house key onto the draw string of my shorts.  There had to be a better way. Every pair of shorts had a key pocket in the waistline... right on my hip flexor. That's not comfortable.  </p>
<p>So, with the help of an amazing design crew, we built the Bryce Running Shirt.  The fitted, water resistant pocket on the left arm holds your phone securely as you move. Keys and other small items can fit in the zippered pocket on the right side.  Reflective piping increases visibility when running in the dark, rain or snow. Simple, secure, practical.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>But we need your help</h3>
<p>We have the prototype and a few samples ready to go. Now it's time to move into production.  An incredible production house in southern Utah is all set to manufacture this line.  We just need the money to get started.  The first $10,000 raised here will go entirely to the manufacturing process.  If we meet our stretch goal of $15,000 we will use the extra funds to market the Bryce shirt line in other ways (think sponsoring local races or paid advertisements on podcasts) as well as begin designing our next project, the Arches Running Shirt (coming out later this year). None of the funds raised here will go to paying me or any of my design team a salary.  </p>

<h3>What's in it for you?</h3>
<p>Let's break it down. Take a look around a local running store or the internet.  A high quality athletic shirt made out of premium technical fabric like the kind we use can easily run $50-80.  Then add in an armband style phone carrier for another $30.  Wow!</p>
<p>We put that all together, in a single comfortable, simple item.  Instead of running you upwards of $80, the Bryce Running Shirt retails for $49.  Our supporters... that's you... will get an even better deal. You will also get your new shirt before they are available anywhere else.</p>

Hey supporters.  My name is Ben.  I've been a runner my whole life.  Whether it was training for the soccer season as a teen or preparing for obstacle course races like Spartan or BattleFrog, I have learned to love the runner's high.  
Finding the right gear is essential to success in any endeavor.  As I searched for the right way to carry my stuff around while running, I grew tired of paying through the nose for name brand gear that didn't get the job done.  I had to carry my phone in my hand and tie my house key onto the draw string of my shorts.  There had to be a better way. Every pair of shorts had a key pocket in the waistline... right on my hip flexor. That's not comfortable.  
So, with the help of an amazing design crew, we built the Bryce Running Shirt.  The fitted, water resistant pocket on the left arm holds your phone securely as you move. Keys and other small items can fit in the zippered pocket on the right side.  Reflective piping increases visibility when running in the dark, rain or snow. Simple, secure, practical.

But we need your help
We have the prototype and a few samples ready to go. Now it's time to move into production.  An incredible production house in southern Utah is all set to manufacture this line.  We just need the money to get started.  The first $10,000 raised here will go entirely to the manufacturing process.  If we meet our stretch goal of $15,000 we will use the extra funds to market the Bryce shirt line in other ways (think sponsoring local races or paid advertisements on podcasts) as well as begin designing our next project, the Arches Running Shirt (coming out later this year). None of the funds raised here will go to paying me or any of my design team a salary.  

What's in it for you?
Let's break it down. Take a look around a local running store or the internet.  A high quality athletic shirt made out of premium technical fabric like the kind we use can easily run $50-80.  Then add in an armband style phone carrier for another $30.  Wow!
We put that all together, in a single comfortable, simple item.  Instead of running you upwards of $80, the Bryce Running Shirt retails for $49.  Our supporters... that's you... will get an even better deal. You will also get your new shirt before they are available anywhere else.

<p>We absolutely love doing cryotherapy, but our biggest lament was that it was too expensive for us to do on a regular basis. We have come up with a business model that keeps it simple and keeps our costs low, so that we can pass on the savings to our customers. Our business model has two basic elements to get cold therapy to folks who can benefit from it!</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> We have already purchased a ""local"" cold therapy machine called the Zimmer 6.  This is a small portable unit that can administer (through a small hose and nozzle) super cooled air to specific areas of the body that need  attention.  Basically, it's a more effective and intense version of  methods like ice packs to reduce inflammation, swelling, and muscle soreness. It can be used before and/or after physical activity, or as part of a physical therapy routine. We are super excited to be able to take the Zimmer 6 around town to various venues to begin offering services, and to build excitement and brand recognition for when we open our trailer for full body sessions as well.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> The trailer! Made in the US by a company based in Texas, this will be the ONLY cryotherapy sauna in Austin with the ability to travel to athletic and health/wellness related events. Taking the therapy to the people! It will spend most of its time parked in an East Austin location with regular business hours, in close proximity to several other local businesses. Personally, we have never loved the cushy spa-like atmosphere that many cryotherapy businesses use, and we want to provide a simple, friendly, and professional atmosphere where people can get individualized cryotherapy services efficiently and affordably. We believe the trailer concept really hits that mark!</p>
<p>Cryotherapy is a quickly growing practice that is being used for a variety of benefits, including better recovery from exercise and injuries, improved sleep, increased energy, improved athletic performance, reduced inflammation and pain, and help with weight management. For those who have not yet experienced it, a cryosauna is a chamber that the client enters wearing minimal clothing per the client's comfort level, in addition to gloves, socks, slippers, and underwear (for men) to protect extremities. The head remains above the sauna while the chamber fills with nitrogen gas. A session takes only 90 seconds to three minutes, so it is very efficient for those with a busy schedule, and can be enjoyed several times a week. Unlike ice baths, full body cryotherapy can be used immediately before exercise without decreasing the pliability of soft tissue, for a burst of extra energy during your workout or competition, or used afterwards for recovery. We love how doing cryotherapy makes us feel, and can't wait to get this business running so we can start sharing the love!  </p>
<p><strong>Where you come in!</strong></p>
<p>We are taking  the standard route of financing our venture through a lender, however, we are hoping to mitigate the amount we have to borrow, and maximize our potential for success by community fundraising.</p>
<p>Our goal is to raise $15K to help with start up costs, including purchasing the trailer and cryosauna, and completing the build out (flooring, furniture, and exterior decoration), developing promotional materials, and meeting monthly expenses as we get going, such as nitrogen supply, insurance, POS system, and rent.</p>
<p>Please help us achieve our dream by donating to our campaign at whatever level you can! We also appreciate help with word of mouth promotion to those you know who may be interested.  You can share our vision with others by using Indiegogo's share tools, as well as through our Facebook page: ATXCryotherapy, Instagram Feed: ATXcryo. We hope to have the trailer up and running by the end of August! Cant wait to see y'all at our opening party! </p>

I will be giving talks, conducting interviews, appearing on the radio and more. I am nailing down the itinerary with the help of WAPF chapter leaders in Australia. The tour includes stops in Victoria, Sydney, Northern Rivers, Toowoomba, Northern Territory, and Cairns. I'm particularly excited about the collaboration with those already very involved in sustainable farming/living in Australia, and the possibility of connecting with indigenous peoples. I'm also thrilled that Talk Radio East Side FM is on the schedule, along with a symposium with Dr. Steven Lin, and a presentation with Dr. Ron Ehrlich. </p>
<p>The biggest challenge along the way will probably just be pacing myself. I'm a connector at heart and I envision many opportunities arising spontaneously. I will work hard to make sure every event and outreach will be top notch, while simultaneously making sure to not to over-stuff the schedule</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560269808/ssvbm9baeud1pawlentf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>A trip of this magnitude requires significant resources. The Weston A. Price Foundation has offered to sponsor the trip to a degree, but $8000 more is needed to cover flights to and from Australia, transportation within the country (it's BIG), food, lodging, and the hiring of a local videographer/photographer to capture content for future release. </p>
<p>I hope to save money by staying with local chapter leaders! I'm not opposed to couch surfing, either. I also am excited by the prospect of hiring a videographer in Australia, so I don't have to incur unnecessary additional travel costs.</p>
<p>Of course I'll cover plenty of expenses out of pocket. But I just can't pull off this project on my own! A friend in Australia actually was the one who came up with this idea to crowdfund the project. </p>
<p>As you can imagine, gifts of any size are MUCH appreciated! This is a big undertaking and it truly cannot take place without significant support. </p>
<p>On a related money note, what happens if we raise more than expected? That would be HUGE! If/when the basic trip expenses are covered, additional monies will be distributed among a number of communities lifting up ancestral health practices in Australia. And if the campaign goal is not reached, what then? Adjustments will be made in terms of the scope of content captured. (In other words, I might not be able to hire someone to record presentations or interviews or various portions of the experience). But, honestly, this is an important reason I am taking this trip: to bring the information back to the world, so I'd hate to have to do this!  </p>

  What will I be doing exactly? I will be giving talks, conducting interviews, appearing on the radio and more. I am nailing down the itinerary with the help of WAPF chapter leaders in Australia. The tour includes stops in Victoria, Sydney, Northern Rivers, Toowoomba, Northern Territory, and Cairns. I'm particularly excited about the collaboration with those already very involved in sustainable farming/living in Australia, and the possibility of connecting with indigenous peoples. I'm also thrilled that Talk Radio East Side FM is on the schedule, along with a symposium with Dr. Steven Lin, and a presentation with Dr. Ron Ehrlich. 
The biggest challenge along the way will probably just be pacing myself. I'm a connector at heart and I envision many opportunities arising spontaneously. I will work hard to make sure every event and outreach will be top notch, while simultaneously making sure to not to over-stuff the schedule

A trip of this magnitude requires significant resources. The Weston A. Price Foundation has offered to sponsor the trip to a degree, but $8000 more is needed to cover flights to and from Australia, transportation within the country (it's BIG), food, lodging, and the hiring of a local videographer/photographer to capture content for future release. 
I hope to save money by staying with local chapter leaders! I'm not opposed to couch surfing, either. I also am excited by the prospect of hiring a videographer in Australia, so I don't have to incur unnecessary additional travel costs.
Of course I'll cover plenty of expenses out of pocket. But I just can't pull off this project on my own! A friend in Australia actually was the one who came up with this idea to crowdfund the project. 
As you can imagine, gifts of any size are MUCH appreciated! This is a big undertaking and it truly cannot take place without significant support. 
On a related money note, what happens if we raise more than expected? That would be HUGE! If/when the basic trip expenses are covered, additional monies will be distributed among a number of communities lifting up ancestral health practices in Australia. And if the campaign goal is not reached, what then? Adjustments will be made in terms of the scope of content captured. (In other words, I might not be able to hire someone to record presentations or interviews or various portions of the experience). But, honestly, this is an important reason I am taking this trip: to bring the information back to the world, so I'd hate to have to do this!  

As mentioned above, monetary support is crucial. If, however, you're not in a position to contribute financially, you can help raise the visibility of the campaign by simply sharing it on social media. Or direct your friends to follow me @holistichilda on Instagram to learn more about this mission to change the world through wise traditions. And thank you!",5.0,0,"3 Campaigns

<p>DYM had few sales already with little to no marketing in various platforms. The only one that we have really tried to use is Facebook at a minimal budget. We would like to reach out more within next 3 months and that is why we are asking for funding. Any funding that is raised will strictly go towards marketing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Creative Workshops for women</li>
<li>Dance Meditation Classes for kids, seniors citizens and women</li>
<li>Other creative products like ebook- Creative Zen series with individual ebooks including regular creative writing </li>
</ul>
<p>No funds raised here will be used to provide salary requirements for any of the helpers/employees working for Dance Your Move.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Target Goal To Reach: $15,000 ( 2 years and after)</p>
<p>More cushion for another year of marketing that will get us more sales and we hire more creatives to create more innovative products, for this the Target goal to reach: $25,000 (3 years and after)</p>
<p>With $15,000, we are hoping to not only provide funding for next few months but after a short interval where we will upgrade our products then we will use rest of the funding for the next round.

<p>We have belief in our signature product and based on where the current trend is going, we have two of the most sought after aspects- health &amp; wellness oriented product AND online products that people can use at their own pace on their own time. </p>
<p>Whatever funds that are raised will go towards marketing two of the above products even if we don't reach our target goal. We will use what we raise to make tracks with DYM so your support will not go to waste. </p>

This is one of the online product that is available to purchase on the website. To go further it is about empowering the next female entrepreneur. The idea was to create a workshop in general that had sets of creative exercises for all but since DYM's founder is a female and empowering the next voice to come up with innovative ideas to be a female seem to be an apt thing for DYM community. Women plays multiple roles everyday and we hope to encourage some of them to pick up the next role as a creative entrepreneur. </div>

<h3>To Our Loved and Respected Clipper &amp; Soul Family</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Megan Goodman, owner/stylist of Clipper &amp; Soul Barbershop in Bloomington, IN. I purchased the barbershop in September 2019, becoming one of the only woman owned, team-based, socially entrepreneuria barbering businesses in the nation.  I have been a stylist since 2007. For me to become an owner/stylist was a dream come true.</p>
<p>When I was a young girl, I remember cutting my siblings hair on the front porch. Cutting hair became a passion. However, I was discouraged from becoming a barber stylist. I was told I need to have bigger dreams and aspirations. I needed to pursue a career as a nurse or something to make lots of money so I wouldn’t have to worry about anything financially. I have been asked many times “Why would you Just Want to Cut Hair?”</p>
<p>After several different career paths, even becoming a Medical Assistant, I found my way back to “just cutting hair”. The thing is, it isn’t about cutting hair at all. For me, it’s about the people, the relationships, the community, the stories and memories we create with other human beings. The bond between an individual and “THEIR barber stylist” that lasts a lifetime. From first grade pictures to senior prom, graduating high school thru college years, engagement photos to wedding day videos, that first “real job” to that big promotion. There is something amazing about the connections you form with people and the community when you are a barber stylist. There is something extraordinary about “JUST CUTTING HAIR”.</p>
<p>As most of you know, the State of Indiana mandated that we close our doors during the COVID-19 pandemic to help protect our community. We are continuing to do our part to mitigate the spread of the virus. </p>
<p>This pandemic took everyone by storm, we could not have prepared for this emotionally or financially. With your help and our determination we have faith that we all can rise above these uncertain times.  These are extremely tough times for everyone across the globe. We continue to brainstorm, exploring ways to rise up from these ashes. We want to add value to our clients so we set-up a <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">INDIEGOGO</a> campaign, providing incentives for contributions. In addition we set up <a href=""http://www.venmo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">VENMO</a> @ClipperandSoul  if you prefer to donate. </p>
<p>We are extremely thankful, grateful and blessed for any contributions we receive. We thank you whole heartedly.</p>

<p>These days most people are “face first” in a computer screen or other digital device from 6 to 7.5 hours a day, or even longer. Let's be honest. <strong>Is that an addiction or what?</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505020474/hpcybfowpaauznhu30zb.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>As you stay glued to your screens all day long, harmful rays are damaging your eyes. And you are probably among the 99% who don't use any kind of eye protection.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>But you aren't going to stop using these devices, are you?</strong></i></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<p>Of course not! So the best solution for sparing your eyes from the harmful <strong>HEV</strong> (blue light) assault they receive daily from these screens is to wear some form of effective eye protection.</p>
<p><strong>HEV</strong> (blue light) rays are as harmful as the better-known UVA and UVB rays we protect ourselves from by wearing sunglasses when we go outdoors. These <strong>HEV</strong> rays are the indoor <u>silent assassin</u> that is slowly but surely degrading your vision.</p>
<p>You <u>must</u> fight this silent, insidious, unrelenting attack on your irreplaceable eyes and help them survive the digital age.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>What is the harm these HEV (blue light) rays are causing?</strong></i></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Melanin is the natural pigment in our skin and eyes that protects us from harmful rays. Located just behind the retina, it protects our eyes from these rays in the same way that it protects our skin. </p>
<p>                                              <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505022200/zoqfb2f0j4eft6uqocqj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>But our eye melanin is incrementally and <u>cumulatively</u> lost as we age. We lose 25% of it by the time we turn 40 – and by age 60, as much as 50% is gone. Blue-eyed people are at even higher risk.</p>
<p>The result is that mature adults can experience increased likelihood of macular degeneration and cataracts as the <strong>HEV</strong> rays harm the retina and macula of the eyes.</p>
<p>The debilitating physical damage may not always become noticeable until later in life, but it starts early with regular exposure until you reach that “holy crap” moment – and then <strong>surgery</strong> may become the only alternative.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p><i>“Compared with age-matched controls, patients with advanced macular degeneration had significantly higher exposure to blue or visible light over the preceding 25 years, but were not different in respect to exposure to UVA or UVB. These data suggest that high levels of exposure to blue or visible light may cause ocular damage, especially later in life, and may be related to the development of age-related macular degeneration.”</i></p>

<p>In addition to these long-term effects, there are uncomfortable short-term afflictions  known as <strong>Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS).</strong></p>

<p>The two most serious complaints are <i>headaches and sleep problems.</i> These sleep problems occur because <strong>HEV</strong> rays suppress melatonin that is necessary for quality sleep.</p>
<p>And as if this weren’t bad enough, 90% of children who use a computer more than 3 hours a day suffer vision problems. (And as we know, their actual use is usually MUCH longer!) Remember — <strong>computer addiction has NO age limits!</strong> We must help younger people protect themselves.</p>

<p>Since you aren't going to stop using digital devices, the best solution is to wear protective computer eyewear. But computer eyewear is not all created equal! What you need is serious, professional-quality protection – NOT the cheap colored glasses in flimsy frames that are often advertised in catalogs or found on Amazon.       <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1505023572/idesgoreafrzdrd0euwm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>These lenses are infused with a scientifically proven, proprietary synthetic melanin called <i><strong>Melaneye.</strong></i> (Synthetic melanin was first created in the labs of the <strong>Yale Medical Research Center.</strong>) We’ve already learned that (1) natural melanin is the body’s protection against harmful rays, (2) it's found not just in our skin but also in the retina of our eyes, and (3) we cumulatively lose the melanin in our eyes as we age. As it is lost, it cannot be replaced – but we <u>can</u> compensate by using lenses with synthetic melanin infused into them. <strong>The Melaneye synthetic melanin that's infused into <i>SightSaver</i> lenses is what sets them apart from ordinary colored computer glasses.</strong></p>
<p>Not only does it protect our eyes, but many people report that the Melaneye synthetic melanin actually increases their visual acuity – making things look sharper and clearer when wearing their <i><strong>SightSaver Computer Glasses</strong></i>.</p>

<p><i>“Wearing lenses with synthetic melanin is a natural means of protecting oneself – it makes up for the loss of retinal melanin that occurs as we age – as melanin is the very pigment that nature has chosen to protect us.”</i></p>

</div></div>","These days most people are “face first” in a computer screen or other digital device from 6 to 7.5 hours a day, or even longer. Let's be honest. Is that an addiction or what?
 

 
As you stay glued to your screens all day long, harmful rays are damaging your eyes. And you are probably among the 99% who don't use any kind of eye protection.
 

But you aren't going to stop using these devices, are you?
 
Of course not! So the best solution for sparing your eyes from the harmful HEV (blue light) assault they receive daily from these screens is to wear some form of effective eye protection.
HEV (blue light) rays are as harmful as the better-known UVA and UVB rays we protect ourselves from by wearing sunglasses when we go outdoors. These HEV rays are the indoor silent assassin that is slowly but surely degrading your vision.
You must fight this silent, insidious, unrelenting attack on your irreplaceable eyes and help them survive the digital age.
 
What is the harm these HEV (blue light) rays are causing?
 
Melanin is the natural pigment in our skin and eyes that protects us from harmful rays. Located just behind the retina, it protects our eyes from these rays in the same way that it protects our skin. 
                                              
But our eye melanin is incrementally and cumulatively lost as we age. We lose 25% of it by the time we turn 40 – and by age 60, as much as 50% is gone. Blue-eyed people are at even higher risk.
The result is that mature adults can experience increased likelihood of macular degeneration and cataracts as the HEV rays harm the retina and macula of the eyes.
The debilitating physical damage may not always become noticeable until later in life, but it starts early with regular exposure until you reach that “holy crap” moment – and then surgery may become the only alternative.
 

 
“Compared with age-matched controls, patients with advanced macular degeneration had significantly higher exposure to blue or visible light over the preceding 25 years, but were not different in respect to exposure to UVA or UVB. These data suggest that high levels of exposure to blue or visible light may cause ocular damage, especially later in life, and may be related to the development of age-related macular degeneration.”
– National Center for Biotechnology Information
      
In addition to these long-term effects, there are uncomfortable short-term afflictions  known as Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS).
                
The two most serious complaints are headaches and sleep problems. These sleep problems occur because HEV rays suppress melatonin that is necessary for quality sleep.
And as if this weren’t bad enough, 90% of children who use a computer more than 3 hours a day suffer vision problems. (And as we know, their actual use is usually MUCH longer!) Remember — computer addiction has NO age limits! We must help younger people protect themselves.
 
             Harvard Medical School weighs in on the subject

 
Now, that's pretty straightforward, isn't it?
 

 
Since you aren't going to stop using digital devices, the best solution is to wear protective computer eyewear. But computer eyewear is not all created equal! What you need is serious, professional-quality protection – NOT the cheap colored glasses in flimsy frames that are often advertised in catalogs or found on Amazon.       
What you need is meaningful, effectiveVISION INSURANCE.
 
Why are these new SightSaver Computer Glasses the state-of-the-art professional protection your eyes need?

 
These lenses are infused with a scientifically proven, proprietary synthetic melanin called Melaneye. (Synthetic melanin was first created in the labs of the Yale Medical Research Center.) We’ve already learned that (1) natural melanin is the body’s protection against harmful rays, (2) it's found not just in our skin but also in the retina of our eyes, and (3) we cumulatively lose the melanin in our eyes as we age. As it is lost, it cannot be replaced – but we can compensate by using lenses with synthetic melanin infused into them. The Melaneye synthetic melanin that's infused into SightSaver lenses is what sets them apart from ordinary colored computer glasses.
Not only does it protect our eyes, but many people report that the Melaneye synthetic melanin actually increases their visual acuity – making things look sharper and clearer when wearing their SightSaver Computer Glasses.
 

 
“Wearing lenses with synthetic melanin is a natural means of protecting oneself – it makes up for the loss of retinal melanin that occurs as we age – as melanin is the very pigment that nature has chosen to protect us.”
– Jose-Alain Safel, French National Hospital Center for Ophthalmology

<p>The first step is to correct your posture, such as reading a book or looking at your phone, to avoid maintaining the same posture for a long time. If it is not serious, pay attention to the warmth of the cervical spine. <strong>Hot compresses</strong> <strong>can help improve t</strong><strong>he blood circulation of the cervical spine and relax the neck muscles</strong>.

<p><strong><u><i>Physical massage type</i></u></strong></p>
<p>Similar to the manipulating of human hands, massage can be achieved by rotating spherical/irregular objects inside the device. Some products also have the function of a hot compress, but be careful not to adjust the strength to too much, so as to avoid excessive massage, which will cause damage and aggravate symptoms. Its appearance is generally thick and has a certain weight.</p>
<p><strong><u><i>Electrical pulse-type</i></u></strong></p>
<p>It's totally different from a physical massager. The shape is similar to that of a headphone, which is hung on the neck when using, and with 2 or 3 massage units (inductive metal electrode plate) on the main part. The electrical pulse signals of different frequencies and duty cycles are used to stimulate the cervical spine and make the muscles contract, all of these will promote blood circulation and remove stasis to relax the muscles and relieve the soreness of the cervical spine caused by the accumulation of lactic acid. Some mid-to-high-end products will also have the function of heating, of course, the effect will be better.</p>

</div></div>","The first step is to correct your posture, such as reading a book or looking at your phone, to avoid maintaining the same posture for a long time. If it is not serious, pay attention to the warmth of the cervical spine. Hot compresses can help improve the blood circulation of the cervical spine and relax the neck muscles. Avoid improper sudden twist and unqualified massage, which can easily cause secondary damage to the fragile neck.

 
 
Physical massage type
Similar to the manipulating of human hands, massage can be achieved by rotating spherical/irregular objects inside the device. Some products also have the function of a hot compress, but be careful not to adjust the strength to too much, so as to avoid excessive massage, which will cause damage and aggravate symptoms. Its appearance is generally thick and has a certain weight.
Electrical pulse-type
It's totally different from a physical massager. The shape is similar to that of a headphone, which is hung on the neck when using, and with 2 or 3 massage units (inductive metal electrode plate) on the main part. The electrical pulse signals of different frequencies and duty cycles are used to stimulate the cervical spine and make the muscles contract, all of these will promote blood circulation and remove stasis to relax the muscles and relieve the soreness of the cervical spine caused by the accumulation of lactic acid. Some mid-to-high-end products will also have the function of heating, of course, the effect will be better.


 




 









 




Therefore, we introduce the most stylish, portable, ultra-modern, and pocket-friendly neck massager- K5 Pro.
 

A few minutes daily usage of it gives stimulating, healthful aid to blood circulationThe High-grade silicone material is more skin-friendly, creating an extraordinary massage experience. For someone with serious muscle tension across the back, neck, and shoulders, it is great – effects can be felt within minutes.

 

TENS (Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) therapy involves the use of low-voltage electric currents to treat pain. TENS therapy blocks or changes your perception of pain. While EMS (Electrical Muscle Stimulation) contracts the neck muscles to build muscle strength for recovery. 
K5 Pro combines dual-frequency pulse technology (TENS+EMS) to bring you a deep massage experience of nerve layer, vascular layer, and muscle layer to give a refreshing massage around your neck.

 

K5 Pro is so light in weight that it can conveniently be carried in a pocket or a purse. 


It has a long-lasting battery. It requires just one-hour charging to provide a battery life of 5 days.Its unique and fashionable shape solves the need for massage anywhere, anytime. 

 

Moreover, it is driven by the British ARM hard-core chip due to which it has a faster running speed and provides a more stable massage force.

 

Four electrode zones, alternately linked, release more than 1000 massage waveforms
 

You can easily switch between modes or strengths with just one swipe and with English voice menu navigation. It works with 3 different temperature levels so you may set the temperature according to your need.

However, our drinking water is not 100% safe now.Recent news about drinking water crisisThis’s exactly what Mahaton Self-Cleaning Bottle all about:  A cutting-edge self-cleaning water bottle that stays sterilized and keeps the water inside as pure as it gets—at all time!    The sterilize feature is what Mahaton Self-Cleaning Bottle all about. The mercury-free UV-C LED technology from Silicon Valley produces a 99.99% sterilization of Mahaton Self-Cleaning Bottle and water.   UV-C LED experimentWith UV-C light at 275nm, it effectively destroys bacteria DNA and RNA strand. Even NASA is using this technology to sterilize their water in space.  With FDA, CE and SGS certifications, the UV-C LED deep UV disinfection technology was first used by NASA to sterilize space gloves and allow astronauts to drink pure water. Now, this technology is family-friendly and within your reach. Using a bottle that you keeps your water fresh,  clean, safe to drink all the time and wherever you go. Mahaton Self-Cleaning Bottle is not just a regular thermos flask. As a personal item, we like to use things that align with our style and interest.  Mahaton's design is inspired by modern architecture and made by top-notch designers from the UK, featuring beautifully smooth and straight forward lines, and gray meranti color system.Refined and truly original aesthetics are not the only new aspect that Mahaton Self-Cleaning Bottle features as opposed to other self-cleaning bottles. We have also added wireless charging technology to this genuinely unique thermos to make it even more convenient and practical for your needs. We're proud to announce our Mahaton as a non-toxic disinfection water bottle, which keeps itself sterilized while not releasing any chemical substance. Mahaton Self-Cleaning Bottle uses green technology to help us protect our planet. On the other hand, Mahaton is an affordable device for everybody. We believe that the purpose of cutting-edge technology is to make people's lives better without leaving anyone behind. Having access to pure water should be a fundamental right in our future, and this key principle reflects on our pricing.We are a start-up company with a big dream, which is to improve people’s personal hygiene through technology and innovation. Using technological innovation to bring health-protect products to worldwide and improve our daily life.  We created products to keep thousands of families safer from bacteria.

Three years into college, the only thing we were sure of was we were tired of eating typical college cuisine. Sure, every once in a while one of us would go into the kitchen and try to recreate one of our favorite home-cooked meals, but the meal usually fell short of bringing Darien to Athens. But the yearning for a good, home-cooked meal just kept growing, and we were determined to make frozen dinners and ramen noodles a thing of the past. One day while sitting around recollecting about high school, we thought about an Art History project we did in Dr. Debbie Smith’s class. We had to make a food from an assigned time period and we were assigned a British Trifle. Your normal British Trifle consists of a thick custard, fruit juice or jello, a sponge cake, and whipped cream. Being as ingenuous as we are and using the ingredients we had at home, our trifle consisted of yogurt, strawberries and blueberries, graham crackers and whipped cream. Dr. Smith dubbed it “The Trifling Trifle”, but it turned out to be delicious and her favorite dish of the class! Finally it hit us- instead of trying to take on the challenge of creating delicious meals single-handedly, why not go into the kitchen and create something together. As time went on and our meals tasted closer and closer to home, we came up with an answer to the question “So what are you planning on doing after college?” </span></p>
<p>Instead of answering, “Well, I’m not really sure yet,” we can now answer with certainty, “We’re gonna open a restaurant.” The Little Fiddle Bar &amp; Griddle will be our southern home-style take on a bar and grill in the Classic City. You don’t live in the Classic City you say? GameDay weekends are an excellent time to experience all that The Little Fiddle has to offer. Our menu will be an eclectic one, best described as bar food with a southern flare. While we will have our own takes on your favorite typical bar food, such as burgers and wings, our extensive weekend brunch menu will be what really sets us apart. It will be a weekly staple for college students and locals alike, as well as the perfect treat for visitors to top off their stay in Athens. Not to toot our own horns or anything, but pretty much anytime we get in the kitchen together, something amazing comes out. This is never more true than when it comes to breakfast. So it only makes sense that our restaurant would have to feature a super awesome brunch menu, and that's exactly what we expect to have.

We are not asking you to completely fund the restaurant, but if one day you’re feeling really generous, you my friend will become Little Fiddle royalty! We have everything necessary for having a successful business; we have the drive, we have the passion, and we have the skills. The only thing we don’t have is the means. This is not just because we don’t want to have a real job, or something we all of a sudden decided to do. The Little Fiddle has been years in the making.

I have been in the Sports Performance industry for almost 10 years now and have had the opportunity to mentor, train and help many individuals reach their goals when I comes to earning sports scholarships.</p>
<p>I am looking for funding to help open my own performance training center to help even more kids reach their goals. I work with many intercity kids that need a way out and a way of becoming successful. I am currently renting space through another gym and am limited in the number of kids I can reach. </p>
<p>Your help will allow me to open a facility that is conducive to what I'm trying to do while teaching athletes from youth to professional on how to become successful through hard work, dedication, commitment and desire to take them to the next level. Thank you for reading this and I hope you can help me, help many others!</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need To Help More Athletes</h3> <p>I am looking to get $15,000 in funding to help open our training facility. Below is what is needed to open the facility:</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>- 3 functional squat racks - $4,500</p>
<p>- Dumbbells up to 110 lbs. - $2,500</p>
<p>- 6 Barbells - $1,200</p>
<p>- Plyo Boxes - $1,600</p>
<p>- Weights - $2,400</p>
<p>- MISC. Equipment - $2,800</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Xplosive Performance Academy is one of the most unique training philosphies in the surrounding area. Our program is completely based around creating the better, more explosive athlete through a scientifically based program with speed training, plyometrics, multi-directional movement, sport-specific strength training and core development. Multiple athletes to come through our program have earned major division 1 sports scholarships and we are looking to quadruple that number.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<strong>Your Impact on Metro Detroit Athletes</strong>
</div><div>
<p>Through the 10 years I have been training athletes, I have had the opportunity to help 100's of them to earn scholarships. This year alone, I had over 40 athletes earn scholarships. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Not only is it important to play their sport at a high level, but a high level of grades are also important.  When I open this facility, I will be teaming with an after school tutoring and ACT prep program to help these athletes focus on their grades and their athletics while staying off the streets and out of harm or troubles ways.</p>  </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> With any business, there is competition. This is my one big challenge and I am charging at any competition full speed ahead. Our program has proven over and over again that we set kids apart from others when it comes to athleticism.</p>

</div></div>","Introduction to Xplosive Performance Academy Hello everyone, My name is John Vickers & I am the Owner/Operator of Xplosive Performance Academy. I have been in the Sports Performance industry for almost 10 years now and have had the opportunity to mentor, train and help many individuals reach their goals when I comes to earning sports scholarships.
I am looking for funding to help open my own performance training center to help even more kids reach their goals. I work with many intercity kids that need a way out and a way of becoming successful. I am currently renting space through another gym and am limited in the number of kids I can reach. 
Your help will allow me to open a facility that is conducive to what I'm trying to do while teaching athletes from youth to professional on how to become successful through hard work, dedication, commitment and desire to take them to the next level. Thank you for reading this and I hope you can help me, help many others!   What We Need To Help More Athletes I am looking to get $15,000 in funding to help open our training facility. Below is what is needed to open the facility:

- 3 functional squat racks - $4,500
- Dumbbells up to 110 lbs. - $2,500
- 6 Barbells - $1,200
- Plyo Boxes - $1,600
- Weights - $2,400
- MISC. Equipment - $2,800

Xplosive Performance Academy is one of the most unique training philosphies in the surrounding area. Our program is completely based around creating the better, more explosive athlete through a scientifically based program with speed training, plyometrics, multi-directional movement, sport-specific strength training and core development. Multiple athletes to come through our program have earned major division 1 sports scholarships and we are looking to quadruple that number.

Your Impact on Metro Detroit Athletes

Through the 10 years I have been training athletes, I have had the opportunity to help 100's of them to earn scholarships. This year alone, I had over 40 athletes earn scholarships. 

Not only is it important to play their sport at a high level, but a high level of grades are also important.  When I open this facility, I will be teaming with an after school tutoring and ACT prep program to help these athletes focus on their grades and their athletics while staying off the streets and out of harm or troubles ways.    Risks & Challenges  With any business, there is competition. This is my one big challenge and I am charging at any competition full speed ahead. Our program has proven over and over again that we set kids apart from others when it comes to athleticism.

My biggest problem when I first started training was that I had a tough time selling to individuals. Now, in my 10th year, it comes easy and I normally have athletes and their parents as pre-sold packages because they see the value and understand that it takes extra to get their kids to the next level.    Other Ways You Can Help I completely understand that some people can't contribute financially. If you can not make a financial contribution, please spread the word through social media, email or word of mouth. 

Thank you all for your time!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

for infectious disease of all Americans. The
suffering is real and, despite efforts, seems to be worsening.

What is the solution? DTB - A water reuse system dreamed up
by us, made real by you, and celebrated by the Alaskan families that will receive
running water for the first time.   
Who are we?
Leading
our team is Brian Lefferts (Project Manager), Bob White (Technical Lead), and Jennifer
Dobson (Health/Social Lead). Our team has extensive experience developing
innovative solutions to water and sewer problems in the Arctic
environment. We have collaboratively implemented many innovative projects over
the past ten years. 
We
all live and work in one of the most remote regions of the United States. We
know firsthand the struggles faced by those without piped water. This
project was developed as a solution to improve health outcomes related to
infectious diseases. Our team is dedicated to the mission, ""working
together to achieve excellent health.""What are the barriers? Community
water systems cost millions of dollars to construct; funding sources have
essentially dried up in recent years; and any remaining project money is highly
competitive. Sadly, the thousands Alaskan homes that don’t have running water
are unlikely to get it anytime soon. These families must carry buckets of water
to their home, and they use “honey buckets” to remove human waste from homes. 
Without your support, the thousands
of homes are not likely to get running water anytime soon. What’s
the idea? In this remote Arctic environment, the real challenge is
not treating the water; it is delivering water to
the home. Over ninety percent of the water used in a home is for washing,
bathing, and laundry – not for drinking. So why not simply re-treat the water
in the home, taking the delivery issue out of the equation? 
The DTB water reuse treatment system involves adding plumbing so
that drain water from the laundry, shower, and bathroom sink gets routed to an
in-home water treatment system. This water is treated with biofiltration and
disinfected. Then, it is routed back into the
home for non-drinking purposes only. Treated water from a community water
system will still be provided to the home for consumption, and toilet (black)
water will be removed away from the home separately. By reusing household greywater, the DTB system cuts back on the
amount of water delivered to each home tenfold, and finally make running water
a reality for thousands of people.Why
do we need you? We’ve designed this revolutionary water
reuse system, but we need your help to build and test it! As
our partner, you will support our steps towards the reality of running water in
thousands of homes.$15,000 will allow us to  build the system and purchase all
supplies needed to complete the pilot test.  
$50,000 funds the one year controlled trial to evaluate it's performance.

Axenia's Story!!

Just two years after birth, Axenia Gherega is going through a very difficult period.
Now half a year his parents noticed a slight change in her left eye.
At the insistence of Axenia's  family doctor parents have made a number of investigations where they had found a rather rare infection. Later, after a thorough investigation, the girl was diagnosed with retinoblastoma, a tumor because that is about to lose his sight.
 Axeniei's parents bowed in a clinic specializing in treating eye problems in Odessa, Ukraine. Here doctors confirmed she was suffering little disease and have recommended to go to a specialist clinic in Germany for an intervention that would save the sight.
On May 11, Stela and Sergiu Gherega together with their daughter were already in Essen, Germany, where doctors have been consulted and gave Axenia hope that the eye could be saved. Surgery was scheduled for May 28, 2015, but for this operation requires 15 thousand euro.
Now, with his right eye sees Axenia with a capacity of just 10 percent. And if not soon will undergo surgery, the girl risks losing sight in both eyes.

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>
An
emerging group of psychologists believes that many of our modern-day
health problems, including, stress, anxiety and depression can be
traced in part to society’s increasing alienation from nature. We
spend 90% of our lives within buildings, excessive indoor living and
a lack of bonding with the Earth causes a disconnection, resulting in
psychological pain. If our thoughts and behaviours are out of balance
with nature, everything about our lives is affected; family,
workplace and the community. We are less likely to be committed to
positively interact with and protect the natural world, destroying
and depleting natural resources faster than they can be renewed which
is leading to ecocide.</p>
<p>
Any
real change in sustainable practice will most likely happen at an
individual level, through changes in attitudes and everyday
behaviour. For this change to happen, an individual will need to feel
connected to the natural world because reconnection to nature is
vital. We are not here to protect nature, we are nature, it’s part
of our self identity. We can improve personal well-being in order to
improve ecological integrity.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>Because you can make a difference, <br/>imagine…</p>the
innovative <a href=""http://journeytogreenwonderland.com/the-green-wonderland-eco-retreat-centre/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Green Wonderland Eco Retreat Centre</a>, a passionate project
in motion where you will get to experience ecological <a href=""http://journeytogreenwonderland.com/ecotherapeutic-retreats/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">integrative therapeutic retreats</a> and <a href=""http://journeytogreenwonderland.com/outreach-and-educational-programmes/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">educational programs</a> on themes related to
personal development across the broadest spectrum of traditions and
teachings. A place where people like you come together to learn,
teach, experience, exchange and inspire others under an ecological
consciousness.

<br/><p>
Together
with your contributions, we plan to raise and earn enough funds to
acquire the property that will become Green Wonderland – Eco
Retreat Centre and open to guests from August 2015 onwards, for
body-mind-heart expanding Eco Retreats. All your donations will be
used for the purchase of this therapeutic, organic and off the grid farm in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The total cost is £195 000 and contributions of any value (from £1 to £3000) can be a significant addition for the existence of this project in this perfect therapeutic environment.</p>
<p>The total cost can be broken down, for example, into 1950 donations of £100 each (We Plant a Tree in your Honour perk).</p>
<p>or 390 donations of £500 each (Therapeutic Retreat - 5 Days - perk).</p>
<p>Because of the amazing health benefits of the summer season, Green Wonderland would like to highlight the two Early Bird Sound Massage in Water perks, where you will get to experience a unique, harmonious and revitalizing sound massage in water. This time limited offer will run from August to September 2015, creating the opportunity for you to experience an integrative therapy with amazing health benefits. After this new summer experience you will get an opportunity to be placed on the guest list for the 2016 summer retreats, to visit Green Wonderland and take part in our other retreats.</p>
<p>We also have our featured Life Transitions and Letting Go Retreat perk where identification with the natural cycle plays out diverse themes providing powerful metaphors to be worked through therapeutically. When we listen, an instinctive wisdom inside each of us reminds us that there must be more. The world is full of wonders and real connection with humans, animals, trees and ourselves is vital. The goal of the 30 day retreat will be assisting you to adjust to major changes by addressing resilience, coping strategies and confidence.<br/></p>

Because
the 12 Permaculture Principles are thinking tools, that when used
together, allow us to creatively re-design our Environment and
Behaviour, based on these principles we developed 12 Eco Therapeutic
Retreats with a set of different therapies and restorative goals:</p>
<p></p>
<p>“<span><i><b>Observe and Interact </b></i><i><b>Retreat</b></i><i><b>”</b></i> – Observe nature and your dreams, interact with them through intuitive and creative thinking.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Mindfulness</li>

<li>Eco-dreamwork</li>
</ul>
<p>“<i><b><span>Catch and Store Energy Retreat” </span></b></i>– Receive the universal life energy, feel re-energised and invigorated. Find out how to retain the permanence of vitality in your life.</p>
<ul>
<li>Usui Reiki</li>
<li>Sound Massage Therapy</li>
<li>Horticultural Therapy</li>
</ul>
<p>“<i><b><span>Obtain a Yield Retreat”</span></b></i> – Learn how to look for and appreciate many different “yields” both physical and non-physical. Be open to receive. The Universe is abundant and generous if we work in harmony with nature’s energies and rhythms. Understand the powerful energies all around and within us, plant and tend the seeds of abundance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Drum Circle</li>
<li>Sound Bath</li>
<li>Eco-dreamwork or dream sharing group</li>
<li>Vegan communal kitchen and communal table</li>
</ul>
<p>“<i><b><span>Apply Self-Regulation and Accept Feedback Retreat”</span></b></i> – Find out how to read nature’s responses to your behaviour and immerse yourself into her natural rhythm and cycles in wild and harmonious settings. A positive experience where the resulting process fosters new personal awareness that leads to positive choices for change.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wilderness Therapy</li>
<li>Green Exercise</li>
</ul>
<p>“<span><i><b>Use and Value Renewable Resources and Services Retreat”</b></i> – This retreat can guide you in making better choices. You will contribute with your energies, where they will be met and multiplied by the energies of others.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Natural Lifestyle Therapy</li>
<li>Horticultural Therapy</li>
<li>Drum Circles</li>
</ul>
<p>“<i><b><span>Produce no Waste Retreat” </span></b></i>– What do I produce that ends up going nowhere? Where are my efforts badly directed? Careful consideration of even the most seemingly negative situations can reveal hidden gifts we might have overlooked.</p>
<ul>
<li>Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)</li>
<li>Synchronicity walks</li>
</ul>
<p>“<span><i><b>Design from Patterns to Details Retreat”</b></i> – Learning our own patterns: what I’m good at, what interests me… and then arranging the details of my life accordingly. Understanding the “story” of our lives, and how that fits into the larger stories of humankind now and in the past and future.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Eco-dreamwork</li>
<li>Eco Art Therapy</li>
</ul>
<p>“<span><i><b>Integrate rather than Segregate Retreat”</b></i> – Understanding interconnections and the mutual dependencies and cooperation’s.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Natural Lifestyle Therapy with Communal Table</li>
<li>Horticultural Therapy</li>
<li>Synchronicity Walks</li>
</ul>
<p>“<span><i><b>Use Small and Slow Solutions Retreat”</b></i> – Reflect on how you partake of nature’s generosity one bite at a time. Slowing down and cultivating peace of mind and body.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Meditation</li>
<li>Usui Reiki</li>
</ul>
<p>“<span><i><b>Use and Value Diversity Retreat” </b></i>– As in nature, diversity creates an abundance of surplus and resilience, two important concepts in both permaculture design and sustainability. Discover the abundance within and strengthen your resilience to create an adaptive response to extreme changes and profound experiences in life.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Green Exercise</li>
<li>Meditation</li>
<li>Eco Art therapy</li>
</ul>
<p>“<span><i><b>Use Edges and Value the Marginal Retreat”</b></i> – Edges can be extremely fertile places in psychological awareness as well as at the intersections of forest and field, water and shore. Listen to the marginalized voices of nature – the animals, plants, storms and waters. Sensations, inner or outer voices that flit across our minds, all are fertile soil for inner growth.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Wilderness Therapy</li>
<li>Mindfulness</li>
</ul>
<p>“<span><i><b>Creatively Use and Respond to Change Retreat” </b></i>– Rather than digging our heels in and resisting change in a futile attempt to save an insolvable way of life, we can embrace change and respond creatively. Taking the problem more deeply inside and alchemizing it into wisdom and insight, but beyond that, moving outside again to ask what the world is saying to us.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Eco Art Therapy</li>
<li>Eco Hypnotherapy</li>
<li>Sound Massage in Water</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<p>When
experiencing these retreats with us, you will be able to connect with
yourself as part of Earth’s web of life and learn how art and
sensory nature moments can help realign critical thinking and provide
lasting personal development. Because connection with wild nature is
an important aid to develop an ecological sensibility and
re-orientate your sense of who and what you are, we want to
support you to reconnect with that source of nourishment, well-being
and inspiration.</p>
<p>
You
will achieve the ability to be in the present moment, with awareness
and openness, and take action, guided by your values. Together we
will promote personal insight, conflict resolution, inner healing and
self-discovery. You will be able to become aware of your strength,
stamina and vitality, adding spark to life and fuelling your dreams,
imagination, playfulness, and intuitive skills.</p>

</div><h3>The Impact</h3><p>
Working
in Gift Economy principles we will accept donations to cover marginal
costs, however, our time, labour and expertise are a gift. Giving
you a fair opportunity whatever your socio-economic status to
facilitate the access to therapies in an eco retreat context. </p><p>Together, with your contribution, we will create local
community-based sharing networks (skills/items/seeds swap and share),
boosting local communities, developing small-scale local responses to
the global challenges of climate change and sustainable living.</p>
<p>
The
educational programs will work with the support of some of the local
schools whereby children will come to Green Wonderland to learn about
the environment and protecting it, help on the land growing fruits
and vegetables in their own organic patch, and have fun learning how
to recycle and the great ways which we can re-use waste.</p>
<p>
With
Green Wonderland’s Animal Sanctuary, we will be dedicated to make a
difference to the lives of the non-human animals being rescued, in addition to
this we aim to educate and influence people through our compassionate
and ethical message.</p>

<br/><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>A challenge for us to create this project would be the raising of the full amount to purchase this specific organic farm. However we have considered this possible scenario and we have developed a tipping point within the main target which would serve as an alternative solution. We have calculated a tipping point of 40% of the total value to be a viable option where we would still purchase a plot of land at a considerably reduced rate, and then would create Green Wonderland from the foundations up. If this were to be the case, where we have not raised the full amount, we would still create Green Wonderland but it would be from approximately April 2016 onwards. We will keep you updated on all the progress once the campaign has ended on our blog and through our social media networks. </p>

<p>We are <a href=""http://journeytogreenwonderland.com/about-us/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sofia and Ivan</a> and it is because of the combined years of expertise in the fields of Psychology, Hypnotherapy, Graphic Design, Art, Meditation, Sound Massage and Reiki, that we sustain the vision and skills to passionately build and develop this project. Values of respect, love and care for all living beings and the Planet as well as a collaborative approach, have been inspiring us to participate in community based work in the areas of Animal Rights protection, Permaculture and Gift Economy. We have a personal reason for starting this project, a passionate vision for what it could become and a social mission. We are dedicated, enthusiastic, skilled, resilient, versatile and well motivated earthlings. Years of dedicated work has allowed us to have a greater depth of understanding of the different dimensions of being human. We have a deep connection with plants, trees, all animals, music and art which in our experience have a way of changing perceptions without the filter of intellectualisation.<br/></p>

<li>Collaborative approach to Living</li>
<li>Adaptability, Creativity and Free-thinking</li>
</ul>Our wish is to live as sustainably as possible by producing the things we need from the land and through gift economy we will be reducing the need to purchase products or recycle. We want to use both solar and hydropower for our electricity, and water from natural resources. All products will be natural and biodegradable and the meals provided will be prepared wherever possible with our own produce, which is grown without the use of artificial chemicals or fertilizers. All organic wastes are disposed of in a compost heap, where it slowly breaks down into very rich, fertile compost. Additionally, we will strive to motivate local and international communities to reduce their ecological footprint.<br/>

<p></p><p></p></div>","Short Summary 



An
emerging group of psychologists believes that many of our modern-day
health problems, including, stress, anxiety and depression can be
traced in part to society’s increasing alienation from nature. We
spend 90% of our lives within buildings, excessive indoor living and
a lack of bonding with the Earth causes a disconnection, resulting in
psychological pain. If our thoughts and behaviours are out of balance
with nature, everything about our lives is affected; family,
workplace and the community. We are less likely to be committed to
positively interact with and protect the natural world, destroying
and depleting natural resources faster than they can be renewed which
is leading to ecocide.

Any
real change in sustainable practice will most likely happen at an
individual level, through changes in attitudes and everyday
behaviour. For this change to happen, an individual will need to feel
connected to the natural world because reconnection to nature is
vital. We are not here to protect nature, we are nature, it’s part
of our self identity. We can improve personal well-being in order to
improve ecological integrity.



Because you can make a difference, imagine…the
innovative Green Wonderland Eco Retreat Centre, a passionate project
in motion where you will get to experience ecological integrative therapeutic retreats and educational programs on themes related to
personal development across the broadest spectrum of traditions and
teachings. A place where people like you come together to learn,
teach, experience, exchange and inspire others under an ecological
consciousness.



With the wellness and healing of the entire person in mind (bio-psycho-socio-spiritual dimensions), and the creation of the links between the Human psyche and the Earth psyche in the emerging fields of Ecopsychology and Eco Art Therapy combined with Permaculture principles and ethics, we created Green Wonderland’s visionary retreats. Permaculture principles and practices of ecological design offers guidance not only for external processes like repairing damaged land but also for the healing of both individual and collective psychological and social terrain creating an opportunity to find balance between outward and inward growth.
   What We Need & What You Get 



Imagine
how beautiful life can be? Because of your message your gift.

We
have found the perfect location and invite you to envisage Green
Wonderland and all that it could become.



Together
with your contributions, we plan to raise and earn enough funds to
acquire the property that will become Green Wonderland – Eco
Retreat Centre and open to guests from August 2015 onwards, for
body-mind-heart expanding Eco Retreats. All your donations will be
used for the purchase of this therapeutic, organic and off the grid farm in the Sierra Nevada Mountains.

The total cost is £195 000 and contributions of any value (from £1 to £3000) can be a significant addition for the existence of this project in this perfect therapeutic environment.
The total cost can be broken down, for example, into 1950 donations of £100 each (We Plant a Tree in your Honour perk).
or 390 donations of £500 each (Therapeutic Retreat - 5 Days - perk).
Because of the amazing health benefits of the summer season, Green Wonderland would like to highlight the two Early Bird Sound Massage in Water perks, where you will get to experience a unique, harmonious and revitalizing sound massage in water. This time limited offer will run from August to September 2015, creating the opportunity for you to experience an integrative therapy with amazing health benefits. After this new summer experience you will get an opportunity to be placed on the guest list for the 2016 summer retreats, to visit Green Wonderland and take part in our other retreats.
We also have our featured Life Transitions and Letting Go Retreat perk where identification with the natural cycle plays out diverse themes providing powerful metaphors to be worked through therapeutically. When we listen, an instinctive wisdom inside each of us reminds us that there must be more. The world is full of wonders and real connection with humans, animals, trees and ourselves is vital. The goal of the 30 day retreat will be assisting you to adjust to major changes by addressing resilience, coping strategies and confidence.




Green
Wonderland’s Visionary Retreats 
(See our 3 and 5 Days Therapeutic Retreats perks).

Because
the 12 Permaculture Principles are thinking tools, that when used
together, allow us to creatively re-design our Environment and
Behaviour, based on these principles we developed 12 Eco Therapeutic
Retreats with a set of different therapies and restorative goals:

“Observe and Interact Retreat” – Observe nature and your dreams, interact with them through intuitive and creative thinking.

Mindfulness
Synchronicity Walks
Eco-dreamwork

“Catch and Store Energy Retreat” – Receive the universal life energy, feel re-energised and invigorated. Find out how to retain the permanence of vitality in your life.

Usui Reiki
Sound Massage Therapy
Horticultural Therapy

“Obtain a Yield Retreat” – Learn how to look for and appreciate many different “yields” both physical and non-physical. Be open to receive. The Universe is abundant and generous if we work in harmony with nature’s energies and rhythms. Understand the powerful energies all around and within us, plant and tend the seeds of abundance.

Drum Circle
Sound Bath
Eco-dreamwork or dream sharing group
Vegan communal kitchen and communal table

“Apply Self-Regulation and Accept Feedback Retreat” – Find out how to read nature’s responses to your behaviour and immerse yourself into her natural rhythm and cycles in wild and harmonious settings. A positive experience where the resulting process fosters new personal awareness that leads to positive choices for change.

Wilderness Therapy
Green Exercise

“Use and Value Renewable Resources and Services Retreat” – This retreat can guide you in making better choices. You will contribute with your energies, where they will be met and multiplied by the energies of others.

Natural Lifestyle Therapy
Horticultural Therapy
Drum Circles

“Produce no Waste Retreat” – What do I produce that ends up going nowhere? Where are my efforts badly directed? Careful consideration of even the most seemingly negative situations can reveal hidden gifts we might have overlooked.

Acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)
Synchronicity walks

“Design from Patterns to Details Retreat” – Learning our own patterns: what I’m good at, what interests me… and then arranging the details of my life accordingly. Understanding the “story” of our lives, and how that fits into the larger stories of humankind now and in the past and future.

Eco-dreamwork
Eco Art Therapy

“Integrate rather than Segregate Retreat” – Understanding interconnections and the mutual dependencies and cooperation’s.

Natural Lifestyle Therapy with Communal Table
Horticultural Therapy
Synchronicity Walks

“Use Small and Slow Solutions Retreat” – Reflect on how you partake of nature’s generosity one bite at a time. Slowing down and cultivating peace of mind and body.

Meditation
Usui Reiki

“Use and Value Diversity Retreat” – As in nature, diversity creates an abundance of surplus and resilience, two important concepts in both permaculture design and sustainability. Discover the abundance within and strengthen your resilience to create an adaptive response to extreme changes and profound experiences in life.

Green Exercise
Meditation
Eco Art therapy

“Use Edges and Value the Marginal Retreat” – Edges can be extremely fertile places in psychological awareness as well as at the intersections of forest and field, water and shore. Listen to the marginalized voices of nature – the animals, plants, storms and waters. Sensations, inner or outer voices that flit across our minds, all are fertile soil for inner growth.

Wilderness Therapy
Mindfulness

“Creatively Use and Respond to Change Retreat” – Rather than digging our heels in and resisting change in a futile attempt to save an insolvable way of life, we can embrace change and respond creatively. Taking the problem more deeply inside and alchemizing it into wisdom and insight, but beyond that, moving outside again to ask what the world is saying to us.

Eco Art Therapy
Eco Hypnotherapy
Sound Massage in Water


When
experiencing these retreats with us, you will be able to connect with
yourself as part of Earth’s web of life and learn how art and
sensory nature moments can help realign critical thinking and provide
lasting personal development. Because connection with wild nature is
an important aid to develop an ecological sensibility and
re-orientate your sense of who and what you are, we want to
support you to reconnect with that source of nourishment, well-being
and inspiration.

You
will achieve the ability to be in the present moment, with awareness
and openness, and take action, guided by your values. Together we
will promote personal insight, conflict resolution, inner healing and
self-discovery. You will be able to become aware of your strength,
stamina and vitality, adding spark to life and fuelling your dreams,
imagination, playfulness, and intuitive skills.


Six main areas were established to relate to Personal Development and Sustainability:
1. Ecological Integrative Therapies;
2. Veganism;
3. Animal Sanctuary;
4. Permaculture and Natural buildings;
5. Outreach and Educational Programmes;
6. Gift economy
Join our tribe, the movement towards an ecological consciousness and lets cultivate resilience together!




The Impact
Working
in Gift Economy principles we will accept donations to cover marginal
costs, however, our time, labour and expertise are a gift. Giving
you a fair opportunity whatever your socio-economic status to
facilitate the access to therapies in an eco retreat context. Together, with your contribution, we will create local
community-based sharing networks (skills/items/seeds swap and share),
boosting local communities, developing small-scale local responses to
the global challenges of climate change and sustainable living.

The
educational programs will work with the support of some of the local
schools whereby children will come to Green Wonderland to learn about
the environment and protecting it, help on the land growing fruits
and vegetables in their own organic patch, and have fun learning how
to recycle and the great ways which we can re-use waste.

With
Green Wonderland’s Animal Sanctuary, we will be dedicated to make a
difference to the lives of the non-human animals being rescued, in addition to
this we aim to educate and influence people through our compassionate
and ethical message.

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Now-a-days there is no denying the fact that a regular yoga and meditation practice works miracles on the mind and body. So why hasn't every single person engaged in a practice?</span><br/></p>
<p>One of the main reasons is that our society has put a lot of emphasis on a community studio practice. The energy of a group is wonderful but its not for everyone. Some people need to get comfortable in their private practice before taking it into a group setting.  If you are suffering from insecurity, depression, anxiety, if you have an unusual work schedule or travel a lot, if you are pinching your pennies, or if you just want to get familiar and comfortable with yoga and sanskrit on your own, going to a studio may be out of the question. </p>
<p>By supporting Virtual Vinyasa you are giving us the ability to create a platform that will allow users to easily discover different types of yoga, meditation, kirtan, and instructors. There is an opportunity here to create this virtual network while promoting studio spaces and instructors from all over the country.</p>

<p>Let me introduce myself, my beliefs, and passions. My name is Jaimie and I am the visionary for Virtual Vinyasa. I have been working in the wellness industry for the last 8 years focusing on massage therapy, yoga, nutrition, herbs, and energetic artwork. The idea for Virtual Vinyasa came to me after seeing outstanding life transformation with one of my private clients. Working with clients privately helped me to see that more people need to learn how to move for their own body. Virtual Vinyasa is a platform that will allow for that freedom. </p>
<p>The Jaimie that began working on this project two years ago is long gone. That Jaimie was always coming from a place of love but with strong cautious undertones of worry, doubt, and fear fueled by normal societal pressures.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433866659/etytqihjuer5b4gegtjy.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 526.666666666667px; height: 395px;""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>The last two years of planning have brought unimaginable spiritual awakening. The fear, the worry, the doubt, are now gone. Those layers have been peeled off, some easier than others. What is left is complete trust and surrender.  What is moving me forward  with Virtual Vinyasa is the understanding that my role on this planet is to do my part in awakening consciousness. Virtual Vinyasa is a way to make this happen.</p>
<p>My personal goal is to begin a new life of living in the present as much as possible and connecting with as many people as I can.  I have laid down the foundation for the concept of Virtual Vinyasa and now is a time to make the connections to bring this concept into reality. </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Help spread the word! Share the Virtual Vinyasa movement <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">on your social media pages!</span></p>
</div></div>","Virtual Vinyasa is a new yoga website and app concept that has been developing over the 18 months. Virtual Vinyasa has been compared to Spotify but for Yoga. Users of Virtual Vinyasa will be able to easily and intuitively create playlists of audio and videos forming yoga classes based on individual mind and body needs, mixing and matching different studios, instructors, styles of yoga, meditations, and music.  





Check out the website and app mock-up pages!







As yoga instructors, we are here to support and expand the yoga community as a whole, promoting connection and consciousness through practice and sharing. By contributing to Virtual Vinyasa you are joining a movement to empower individuals to take their yoga practice into their own hands with an at home practice, while still supporting brick and mortar studios. 


Now-a-days there is no denying the fact that a regular yoga and meditation practice works miracles on the mind and body. So why hasn't every single person engaged in a practice?
One of the main reasons is that our society has put a lot of emphasis on a community studio practice. The energy of a group is wonderful but its not for everyone. Some people need to get comfortable in their private practice before taking it into a group setting.  If you are suffering from insecurity, depression, anxiety, if you have an unusual work schedule or travel a lot, if you are pinching your pennies, or if you just want to get familiar and comfortable with yoga and sanskrit on your own, going to a studio may be out of the question. 
By supporting Virtual Vinyasa you are giving us the ability to create a platform that will allow users to easily discover different types of yoga, meditation, kirtan, and instructors. There is an opportunity here to create this virtual network while promoting studio spaces and instructors from all over the country.






  Instructors will have the opportunity to post their local studio class schedule on the website and app. This will give users the ability to be able to practice in person with instructors that they already feel comfortable with, when they choose to take their practice to the studio space. 





                                                                     Coming Soon!The San Diego Round Robin features 6 instructors from 3 studio locations showing you how while mixing and matching instructors and styles you are able to create a fluid class. The Grotto Yoga Flow features 3 instructors from 1 studio. This gives studios an example of how we can promote their space and instructors by featuring them on the website and app. 



On top of the physical yoga practice another passion is sharing the stories of people living consciously, making changes in their communities.  Along this life journey we learn many lessons. Lessons of struggle, of transformation, of wisdom, of growth. Sharing the stories behind these lessons can be inspiring and empowering which is why the Virtual Vinyasa Podcast features instructors, students, and business' that are passionate about the conscious movement and what it took them to get to where they are on their journey. You can download the Virtual Vinyasa podcast on iTunes or by clicking the link above. 



Let me introduce myself, my beliefs, and passions. My name is Jaimie and I am the visionary for Virtual Vinyasa. I have been working in the wellness industry for the last 8 years focusing on massage therapy, yoga, nutrition, herbs, and energetic artwork. The idea for Virtual Vinyasa came to me after seeing outstanding life transformation with one of my private clients. Working with clients privately helped me to see that more people need to learn how to move for their own body. Virtual Vinyasa is a platform that will allow for that freedom. 
The Jaimie that began working on this project two years ago is long gone. That Jaimie was always coming from a place of love but with strong cautious undertones of worry, doubt, and fear fueled by normal societal pressures.



The last two years of planning have brought unimaginable spiritual awakening. The fear, the worry, the doubt, are now gone. Those layers have been peeled off, some easier than others. What is left is complete trust and surrender.  What is moving me forward  with Virtual Vinyasa is the understanding that my role on this planet is to do my part in awakening consciousness. Virtual Vinyasa is a way to make this happen.
My personal goal is to begin a new life of living in the present as much as possible and connecting with as many people as I can.  I have laid down the foundation for the concept of Virtual Vinyasa and now is a time to make the connections to bring this concept into reality. 




The goal of raising $888 was divinely inspired. When I think of the number 8, infinity comes to mind. I like to believe this journey will have infinite possibilities for success and the 888 is a beautiful reminder. By funding for this amount and exceeding it, I am allowing this campaign to stay open for funding past the 60 day run, allowing Virtual Vinyasa to continuously raise funding. 
I have done the projections for Virtual Vinyasa and could tell you that with contracting out people to build the website and app, run the marketing campaign, and for filming, editing and traveling costs we are looking at a business that would require $300,000 or more for start-up costs. But I do not want to contract people. 
The Pilgrimage I am embarking on is an opportunity to not only gain local community support around the country, it is also an opportunity for my team to find me. I am putting the intention out there that there are consciously living people who would like to get involved with a start-up like Virtual Vinyasa. People who are tired of working for Corporate America and see the value of joing me in this conscious business.


  

The Pilgrimage in conjunction with this campaign launch is the first wave of seeking awareness and gaining community support for Virtual Vinyasa. It is an opportunity to connect with whoever I am guided to connect with. I have many tools under my tool belt. Yoga, meditation, massage, thai yoga, energetic mandala artwork, mindful vegan cooking, podcasting-storytelling. 
I am taking my tool belt on the road during this campaign. Whichever way I am guided to connect is the way I will. Where ever the road leads me is the right road. There is no real destination, there is no time limit, there is only a mission. A mission to lead by example, to stir the pot, to open eyes, to empower others, to share my vision, to connect with anyone who wants to, to seek out like minded individuals to join me on this journey.

</div></div>","The food industry has hit a tipping
point. 
Weight
management
has switched from being a specific diet regime to an everyday top-of-mind
concern that people consciously build into their everyday eating choices.
Research
shows that up to 80% of food on grocery shelves have added sugar. Food that is
almost impossible to stop eating.  Is it
any wonder that globally over half of consumers now see themselves as
overweight while a clear majourity are
interested in lowering their sugar intakes? 

It is the source of calories that is crucial in weight wellness. There is mounting scientific evidence that sugar promotes fat storage and hunger while protein, dietary fibre and fats support hunger suppression and reduce calorie consumption throughout the day.




A breakthrough in healthy snacking.



3
Sinners
have created a recipe that hits the trifecta of curbing sugar cravings, reducing food intake and providing sustained energy. Cookies that give permission to enjoy, fill you up not out and lead to a healthier body shape.

Indulgent, gluten-free,
have no added sugar and made with natural ingredients.  
Each individually wrapped cookie is packed with 33 grams of 3 Sinners 'cure your cravings' recipe mix. Ingredients like nut and milk proteins, free-range eggs, almonds, low sugar fruit, un-sweetened dark chocolate, natural dietary fibre and grass-fed New Zealand butter.
Support us and feel the difference one cookie a day makes.

Review


As we know the principal problem of social communication is the first contact
with the person, because to communicate a person you need at least his mail,
name, twitter, phone number, etc. 
Cosmox is a social red which solve this problem, it allows the free interaction
between users of your neighborhood, it incorporates to the map of your city,
make your planet an universe.
¿How
does it work? 

First of all, you need to choose a planet, it can be pre-designed or also you
can make it and designed from zero. 
Situate
your home on your neighborhood map, then collocate your planet.

Each
planet represents an user on the location of his residence.

On your planet you can upload every kind of information, for example, blogs
with your thoughts and share the things you like.


If
you have a business you can make an online-shop for it, for example,
restaurants or products of wherever kind and sell it at that moment online 

You can put any announcement as particular product you sell

Share your music and files, you can also check who has visited your planet.

Cosmox
has an endless of applications, your imagination is the limit. You can put in
contact with every user and send it a message, and if he wants, share with you
what he did on his day.  You can explore
every planet and find similarities with yours or also you could contact someone
of your location for a professional service, Cosmox is the exit door, we dare
you, maybe you can find an new universe outside. 
You
can share your music, and also listening to it with the reproductive or explore
music of other planets and add it on your music carpet or just listening to it. 

You can share some book which liked you and upload it, and that way everybody
will be able to read it. Think about it… how someone recommends us a book if we
can’t access to it. This application brake these complications. 

You like it?
This is just the beginning


Cosmox
is a crew of 4 people who works for an internet more inclusive and a society more
communicated. 
Winner
of Campus Party México 2015 as best project of innovation and social impact, we
count with support of the University of Guadalajara for its diffusion.



Cosmox
will be the first social network on the world, to make this happen we need you,
every dollar, every person, every thought makes the difference for a different
universe.

<h3>Meet Charm</h3>
<div><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Why do the existing baby monitors often act like a combination of a walkie-talkie and an IP camera?</span></div><div><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We have lots of imaging technologies applied in everyday life. In airport and border control, we apply the thermal imaging to check body temperature from a distance. </span></div><div><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">On our phones and digital cameras, we have face detection as a trigger to take picture or to detect blinking. <i>Why can't we have a baby monitor that embraces this kind of technologies, and help with the parent when it comes to nurturing baby?</i></span></div><div><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><i><br/></i></span></div>
<div>So CharmCam Studio is formed. We felt that there had to be a better way to help parents monitoring and taking care of their babies. Today there are so many amazing technologies in sensing and connectivity, our goal is to make use of these technologies and make a better monitor and gears for babies and parents. In our first step, we reinvented the baby monitor and build <i>a baby monitor that does monitor</i> (finally!).</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b><h3>Continuous Body Temperature Monitor</h3></b></div>
<div><img alt=""CharmCam"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/FDbEz6X.gif"" src="""" style=""width: 476px; height: 265px;""/></div>
<div><br/></div><div>CharmCam equips with the same thermography technology as you see in airport and border. The embedded long wavelength infra-red (LWIR) detector measures your baby's body temperature, and you can configure notification to alert you when your baby has elevated body temperature, or notify you when your baby's body temperature returns to normal.</div><div><br/></div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">With this function, you don't need to risk waking up your baby hourly when it has elevated body temperature. You can see the current and body temperature record on your phone. Just few clicks away!</span></div><div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div><b><h3>Blocked Face Detection</h3></b></div>
<div><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><img alt=""CharmCam"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i.imgur.com/FumloUv.gif"" src="""" style=""width: 476px; height: 265px;""/></span></div>
<div><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Face detection is not new. You have this on your phone, on your digital camera - but why don't we apply it on baby monitor? Using thermal and visible light imaging, CharmCam can determine whether your baby's face is covered, and alert you to your phone with live video.</span></div><div><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>

CharmCam offers you with its tricks -- lullabies of your choices and twinkle LEDs. You can select the music file or playlist using our app, and CharmCam can play it along to your baby. You can set timer to turn off the lullabies, or to set a timer to turn it on as a wake-up notice to your baby. A good mixture of twinkle LEDs and lullabies can be your new tricks to soothe your baby to sleep! </span></div>

<h3>Front and Rear Camera</h3></b>Why can you hardly find a baby monitor that can see what's happening at the front and at the back? Your mobile phone has front and rear camera, why don't we have this on the baby monitor, so that we can have a better look at baby's room and around the crib?</span></div>
<div><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">CharmCam equips with both front and rear camera.

<b><h3><br/></h3>
<h3>One App, Full Control</h3></b>CharmCam can be fully controlled by its app. You can access all the sensing measurement, including the video footage, baby's body temperature, the room temperature, humidity, background noise level, oxygen level and toxic level in the air. All the records of these measurements can be accessed in the app, and shared with your family. </div>

<b><h3>The Image Quality</h3></b>Both front and rear camera on CharmCam are of 1080P resolution at a frame rate higher than 15 frames per second. The live view from CharmCam through our app may show a about 1.5 second delay in its best performance. We are working to improve this delay but this may be held off till after our initial production run has been completed. </div><div><br/></div>
<div>
<b><h3>The Air</h3></b>Each CharmCam carries air quality detector, which can measure the levels of oxygen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b><h3>The Thermal Sensing</h3></b>The thermal sensing technology on CharmCam is the same as you see in the airport. It can detect long wavelength infra-red (LWIR) light and convert it to temperature measurement.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div><b><h3>The Camera Mount</h3></b></div>
<div>We understand that reinventing the baby monitor does not mean to reinvent the camera mount. So CharmCam baby monitor supports a standard  1/4"" tripod mounting. In each set of CharmCam, we include two carefully selected camera mounts for you. One is the L-shape mounting (white), and the other one is the clamp-type mounting (black). </div><div><br/></div>
<div><i>EXCLUSIVE OFFER: The clamp-type mounting is FREE-OF-CHARGE only for our backers from Indiegogo. Don't miss this!</i></div>

Why do the existing baby monitors often act like a combination of a walkie-talkie and an IP camera?
We have lots of imaging technologies applied in everyday life. In airport and border control, we apply the thermal imaging to check body temperature from a distance. 
On our phones and digital cameras, we have face detection as a trigger to take picture or to detect blinking. Why can't we have a baby monitor that embraces this kind of technologies, and help with the parent when it comes to nurturing baby?
So CharmCam Studio is formed. We felt that there had to be a better way to help parents monitoring and taking care of their babies. Today there are so many amazing technologies in sensing and connectivity, our goal is to make use of these technologies and make a better monitor and gears for babies and parents. In our first step, we reinvented the baby monitor and build a baby monitor that does monitor (finally!).

Continuous Body Temperature Monitor

CharmCam equips with the same thermography technology as you see in airport and border. The embedded long wavelength infra-red (LWIR) detector measures your baby's body temperature, and you can configure notification to alert you when your baby has elevated body temperature, or notify you when your baby's body temperature returns to normal.With this function, you don't need to risk waking up your baby hourly when it has elevated body temperature. You can see the current and body temperature record on your phone. Just few clicks away!
Blocked Face Detection

Face detection is not new. You have this on your phone, on your digital camera - but why don't we apply it on baby monitor? Using thermal and visible light imaging, CharmCam can determine whether your baby's face is covered, and alert you to your phone with live video.
Lullabies and Twinkle LEDsWe know that soothing a baby to sleep can use a few tricks. CharmCam offers you with its tricks -- lullabies of your choices and twinkle LEDs. You can select the music file or playlist using our app, and CharmCam can play it along to your baby. You can set timer to turn off the lullabies, or to set a timer to turn it on as a wake-up notice to your baby. A good mixture of twinkle LEDs and lullabies can be your new tricks to soothe your baby to sleep! 


Front and Rear CameraWhy can you hardly find a baby monitor that can see what's happening at the front and at the back? Your mobile phone has front and rear camera, why don't we have this on the baby monitor, so that we can have a better look at baby's room and around the crib?
CharmCam equips with both front and rear camera. Each is configured with super wide field of view lens. You can click on your app to see the front and rear view.



One App, Full ControlCharmCam can be fully controlled by its app. You can access all the sensing measurement, including the video footage, baby's body temperature, the room temperature, humidity, background noise level, oxygen level and toxic level in the air. All the records of these measurements can be accessed in the app, and shared with your family. 

CharmCam's app supports both iOS and Android.

Demonstration of the thermal sensing capability of CharmCam. Each CharmCam is well-calibrated by black body (a temperature controlled device) to yield thermographic measurement.

The Image QualityBoth front and rear camera on CharmCam are of 1080P resolution at a frame rate higher than 15 frames per second. The live view from CharmCam through our app may show a about 1.5 second delay in its best performance. We are working to improve this delay but this may be held off till after our initial production run has been completed. 

The AirEach CharmCam carries air quality detector, which can measure the levels of oxygen, carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide.


The Thermal SensingThe thermal sensing technology on CharmCam is the same as you see in the airport. It can detect long wavelength infra-red (LWIR) light and convert it to temperature measurement.

The Camera Mount
We understand that reinventing the baby monitor does not mean to reinvent the camera mount. So CharmCam baby monitor supports a standard  1/4"" tripod mounting. In each set of CharmCam, we include two carefully selected camera mounts for you. One is the L-shape mounting (white), and the other one is the clamp-type mounting (black). 
EXCLUSIVE OFFER: The clamp-type mounting is FREE-OF-CHARGE only for our backers from Indiegogo. Don't miss this!

victory, no healing(image credit: The Pitch Kansas City weekly alternative newspaper)I was one of a handful of physicians in Kansas willing to provide abortion care. In 2012 my license to practice medicine in
the State of Kansas was revoked because of my decision
to keep medically-irrelevant-but-personally-identifying details out of the
medical records of abortion patients. While the 2014 outcome
of the District Court appeal was a resounding victory legally, the Kansas State Board of Healing Arts refused to reinstate my license, and the extended appeal process may take years. Recently, my job at a Kansas university was terminated without explanation. The history below shows how our situation is part of a concerted campaign of retaliation against my work on 
behalf of reproductive freedom, the goal of which is to drive me and my 
family into bankruptcy and out of Kansas. 
Please help me remain a voice for reproductive rights in KansasThe overwhelming response to our 2013 Indiegogo campaign allowed us to save our tiny farm, repay critical debts and fix
serious problems such as restoring running water to our 100-year-old farmhouse. We know many,
many people are hurting financially, so we are even more humbled and inspired by the
outpouring of support we received.Now we need your help again, to regain
my medical license, help our son begin his freshman year in college, and to continue our efforts to be a voice for the people of Kansas. One supporter wrote something that continues to haunt me:

“Please keep fighting for a country I can believe in.”

State
of Insanity: The reality nobody wants to acknowledgeKansas is now firmly in control of Tea Party Republicans
intent on arming everyone, ridding the state of public schools and poor people, trampling the civil rights of its citizens and mandating that doctors practice bad medicine. For years the Kansas medical board has been completely
silent about the unethical and adverse health consequences of the ongoing slew of dangerous and senseless legislation
added to the Kansas statutes, and it continues to field an unending stream of unfounded complaints from a convicted domestic terrorist. 
On March 25, 2015 before the Kansas legislature, Rep. Mike Kiegerl compared me to Josef Mengele, complaining
that Dr. George ""Tiller is dead but Neuhaus is still alive"". In December of 2006 - almost a decade ago - some of my patients' medical records were seized without due
process by men working for now-disbarred former Kansas AG Phill Kline.
 Kline, an attorney who raised campaign funds at churches - in clear 
violation of the U.S. Constitution - spent his entire term attempting to
destroy every abortion clinic in Kansas, and even made appearances on The O’Reilly Factor to share details from patients' medical records. The
witch-hunt was continued by disgraced former Kansas AG Paul Morrison, allegedly under pressure from an employee with
whom he admitted having an adulterous relationship. At trial, the jury rejected the State’s misdemeanor charges against Dr. Tiller after an unprecedentedly short deliberation of only 45 minutes.
Strange
bedfellows: The Kansas medical board and a convicted domestic terrorist

Following Dr. Tiller's acquittal, mirror accusations against both Dr. Tiller and me were immediately announced by the Kansas medical board.  These ""charges"" were filed on behalf of Cheryl Sullenger, a convicted clinic bomber. Sullenger is now the “Senior Policy Advisor”
for Operation Rescue, an organization that specializes in racketeering-like actions against health providers. In spite of her
criminal past and associates, including members of the Army of God,
justifiable homicide signatories and the author of the Nuremberg files, a website that glorifies the murder of doctors, her innumerable baseless complaints continue to be
treated seriously by the Kansas medical board. Unlike most professional licensing boards, the Kansas medical board fields complaints from any member of the public anywhere in the world; no professional relationship or even previous interaction with the practitioner is necessary to file a complaint.The Kansas medical board is appointed by the Governor. Not all member are medical practitioners and some have questionable credentials for this role, even as so-called ""public members"". One public member, seen here posing with Gov. Sam Brownback, recently threatened to commit suicide on Facebook. Her bizarre rambling soliloquy was her only contribution to my revocation hearing, and clearly demonstrates her complete lack of knowledge as to what is required in a medical record. The other public member is Richard Macias, an attorney who makes a living from adoptions, and who represented Operation Rescue while it was headed by Randall Terry, the organization's founder whom they had to publicly disavow after he spoke favorably about the murder of Dr. Tiller. Board members have been deliberately
kept ignorant that the complainant is an executive for Operation Rescue. And while the medical board has been criticized for basing licensing decisions on inappropriate political inquiries, current members seem unaware or unconcerned that one of their fellow board members is a longtime anti-abortion activist, despite the fact that his highly controversial appointment made the national news. A board attorney even objected to our request for Macias to recuse himself (although he did so following a closed-door session) in spite of the obvious conflict of interest. Macias was the primary speaker at my original revocation hearing, basing his argument for revocation on his erroneous statement of the prevailing standard of care for referrals. Unbelievable, huh?
The Kansas medical board rarely revokes a physician's license, generally only following a criminal conviction and never previously for inadequate record-keeping. As we have argued, in some cases even serious multiple offenders have not been revoked. In contrast, I've treated tens of thousands of patients with an exemplary
safety record and without a single legitimate complaint, or any demonstration of patient injury, or lawsuit in over 25 years
of medical practice. Yet, to date, the State of Kansas has expended over
$100,000 prosecuting my case and is still trying to make me pay the cost of it.This why we need your help to enable me to continue to oppose the dire state of women’s health care in Kansas, and to help expose the right-wing’s attempt to export this insanity to other states.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

worked in the pharmaceutical and chemical industry for over 11 years in Supply
Chain Management before children. </p>
<p>After
having our kids, we started to switch our normal routines over to all-natural
routines; including the food we eat, the products we use in our home and on our
bodies. This lifestyle change played an important role in where we are today
with MIZZI COSMETICS.</p>
<p>When my
children suffered from chapped lips last year, we tried everything advertised,
or recommended to us by friends and family. Nothing worked, or worked
for long. I wanted something natural, healing, and long lasting – something
that truly worked. I decided to make something myself, using all natural
ingredients such as pure honey, a vegan base, and therapeutic essential
oils.  After almost 20 attempts to get my product perfect, I made a huge
batch. I had so much lip balm I gave it away to family and friends. I received
such a positive response that I made more and gave away almost 300
lip balms over the summer. Our product was not only an aid in healing
chapped dry lips, but it provided a fabulous unexpected gloss with an extremely
long wear.</p>
<p>I knew we
had a special product, and decided to launch a small business and sell it to
local retailers. LIPLUXE LLC was born October 2014. That December, a
family friend offered to introduce it to a few boutiques on the
West Coast. His sister is a publicist with contacts at the gifting suites for
the 2015 Oscars. She loved our product and shared it with them and they loved
it too. She got us into two gifting suites: The Roger Neal Style Gifting suite
and GBK's gifting suite.</p>
<p>This
opportunity created tremendous buzz, and local media attention, for our story

<p>We
are passionately committed to creating a line of all natural and organic

<p>We
also believe in the importance of giving back to our community. We donate a
portion of our sales to a small local non-profit organization called
""Little Hearts"" and also to The American Heart Association. Both
organizations play a big role in support, research and educating people
affected with Heart disease. As you watch our video, you will see how heart

<p>We
want to raise $25,000. We are running this business out of our dining room, and

<p>We are three friends who came to the US to get our MBA’s at Babson College. Coming from Japan and India, tea is really important to our culture. With a growing tea market in the US of $2.4B, we thought that there must be a better way to use technology to create a better tea drinking experience.

<p>Now we are ready to launch Teplo and get it into the hands of tea enthusiasts all over the world and we need your help. With the money we raise from this campaign, we will be able to purchase tooling and thus kickstart the manufacturing process.

1°serie of products. 






Bimp'Air is the first high pressure refillable
miniaturized system which can deliver 50bar/725psi  performances to manage
the air in a nomadic and more than ever comfortable way. 
Today, we offer an innovative solution as an accessory
for bikes but this is only the first step!
Imagine... integrating our technology into a bike to
make the bike of the future, creating the air it needs and automatically
regulating the pressure... That could be on any bike tomorrow.





Apart from the bike market, we found numerous other
applications where the high pressure mini compressor and its separate and
refillable reserve of air can serve. We already found applications for motorcycles, scooters, cars, wheelchairs, for
gardening, DIY, or in the mechanical industry... and there is a lot more to imagine. 
We enjoy dreaming ... but we are convinced that a lot
of projects will follow to extend our technology and that Bimp'Air will
definitely become a new way to manage the Air!

<span style=""text-align: left;""> <p>We have been working directly with families since the beginning and know how important this is to you. We know it’s hard to wait, but we promise to work as hard as we can to make this happen and we hope it will be worth the wait!<br/></p>
<p>We understand the importance of providing quantified care that is reliable, accurate, and effective. We want to provide care that is reflective of every individual’s uniqueness.</p>
<p>That being said, Reveal will be a complicated machine. The device requires hardware, software, and data analytics. All of this will interact with you through a simple and clear interface, and a comfortable, durable form factor. And that’s not going to be easy.</p>
<p>We still have a lot to do, from choosing the final material, designing the clasp, to making sure the readings are accurate.</p>
<p>We are working tirelessly to bring all of these pieces together. We are finalizing our app and form factor prototypes by engaging directly with families so we can better understand how to make Reveal right for you.</p>
<p>Our development team is hard at work and focused on optimizing our machine-learning algorithm and building out the app, and we are working on a licensing agreement with the top developer of physiological measurement hardware.</p>
<p>So far, we have been operating on a shoestring budget and still have made significant progress. The next step is to go from a working prototype to testing it and making sure it does exactly what it needs. After that, we need to go through manufacturing and then finally the distribution, which means Reveal in your hands.</p>
<p>We have support from experienced mentors who are helping us guide the development of Reveal. We are involved in the Coast Capital Savings Innovation Hub and the Next36 Accelerator to help us ensure that the transition from concept to finish product happens smoothly.</p>
<p>We are working to confirm our entire supply chain by the end of 2016. Our goal is to ship Reveal Version 1.0 to you by May of 2017.</p>

<span style=""text-align: left;""> <p>Our body’s nervous system automatically responds to physical, emotional, and cognitive stressors. For example, knowing you have a big test coming up, or hearing a loud noise can evoke nervous system reactions.</p>
<p>The autonomic nervous system responds to these stressors by activating the sympathetic nervous system, which results in a number of physiological and behavioural changes.</p>
<p>Reveal will measure and track a combination of the three leading physiological indicators of changes in anxiety as a result of these stressors.</p>
<p>These indicators are:</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464046207/VideoIcons-blue_bgzcds.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>So, how exactly does this work?</p>
<p>When alerted, your sympathetic nervous system can activate certain sweat glands, resulting in “emotional sweat”. Electrodermal activity is a measure of change in skin conductance as a result of this “emotional sweat”. We will measure EDA through small electrical changes in the skin using two dry electrodes - a painless way of measuring EDA.</p>
<p>Your sympathetic nervous system also affects your circulatory system. When alerted by external stress, your heart rate will increase, and the diameter of your blood vessels will decrease. We can measure heart rate by shining a light on the skin and measuring the change in the light reflected as the blood pumps in and out of peripheral arteries. We can indirectly measure changes in blood vessel diameter by observing changes in skin temperature, which are tracked with a sensitive thermistor.</p>
<p>All of these sensors will be powered by a rechargeable Lithium-ion battery.</p>
<p>Reveal will identify the physiological patterns that relate to anxiety to give you more insight into what is happening internally.</p> <h2>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b style=""text-align: left;"">Is Reveal made just for autism?</b></p>
<p><span style=""text-align: left;"">Reveal is not limited to ASDs. We're starting with the autism community to focus our initial design and data collection efforts. Once we get the wearable working well for this community we would love to use it for the variety of other purposes for which it could help provide insights. Other possible applications can include measuring stress for PTSD, generalized anxiety disorders, or for people with dementia.<span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span></span></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b style=""text-align: left;"">Can Reveal work without the Reveal + subscription?</b></p>
<p><span style=""text-align: left;"">Yes, we will have a free version of the app available so that you can use Reveal at no monthly cost. The unlimited version will be available for only 9.99$/mo.<span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span></span></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""text-align: left;""><b>Who can use Reveal?</b></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Right now, we’re designing Reveal for children with an ASD, their parents, caregivers and behavioural consultants because they are the ones already tracking and gathering the data we need to make Reveal most effective. That being said, Reveal will ultimately be used for self-regulation for autistic children, teenagers, and adults alike.  In the long term, we want this to be available to all those who need it, but we need to start in the right place.</p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;text-align: left;""><b><br/></b></p>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;text-align: left;""><b>How will Reveal help me identify what triggers anxiety for me/my child?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Identifying triggers of anxiety is a complicated process. We are starting this process in our current study by measuring physiological data and matching the recorded patterns to observed behaviours.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">When Reveal becomes available, you will be able to go onto the app and tell it what’s happening in real time. As you are recording, you can go into the app and let it know where you are/what you’re doing, and provide details of the situation. Is your child laughing? Playing? Screaming?  What happened before? What is happening as a result? This way when you look back at the data, you will have access to all this information.<br/><br/>But, as you use Reveal, it will get to know you and get smarter. So the next time it notices anxiety levels rise distinctly above the baseline you will get a notification with a simple prompt such as, “hey, I just noticed a spike, what’s up?” This will allow you to notice and contextualize each rise in anxiety the moment it happens.<br/><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><b style=""font-weight: bold;"">Are you doing trials for Reveal? Can I/my child participate?</b><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span>Yes, we are conducting trials. The eligibility requirements for the current study are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p style=""text-align: left;"">Must be located in the lower mainland of British Columbia, Canada.</p></li>
<li><p style=""text-align: left;"">Must have an ASD diagnosis</p></li>
<li><p style=""text-align: left;"">Must not taking medication for anxiety regulation. Send a message to <a href=""mailto:igg@awakelabs.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">igg@awakelabs.com</a> if you meet the above criteria. If you are interested in being considered for future studies, sign up for our mailing list through <a href=""http://www.awakelabs.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.awakelabs.com<span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span></a></p></li>
</ul>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;text-align: left;""><b>Why, “autistic person” rather than “person with autism” or “person with an ASD”?</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We understand that this is a recurring topic of debate and in fact, we started this campaign using person first language. Since the launch we’ve received a number of emails from autistic individuals asking us about our choice in language and in light of these, we have changed it. We are constantly learning new things and are actively working to be the best possible allies to the community so if you have a concern please speak up!</p>

We're putting a lot of work into how Reveal will look and feel, constantly making progress and improving. We have spoken to hundreds of parents, caregivers, and care experts to help us understand how to design a band that will work best. 
 













 









 














 We have been working directly with families since the beginning and know how important this is to you. We know it’s hard to wait, but we promise to work as hard as we can to make this happen and we hope it will be worth the wait!
We understand the importance of providing quantified care that is reliable, accurate, and effective. We want to provide care that is reflective of every individual’s uniqueness.
That being said, Reveal will be a complicated machine. The device requires hardware, software, and data analytics. All of this will interact with you through a simple and clear interface, and a comfortable, durable form factor. And that’s not going to be easy.
We still have a lot to do, from choosing the final material, designing the clasp, to making sure the readings are accurate.
We are working tirelessly to bring all of these pieces together. We are finalizing our app and form factor prototypes by engaging directly with families so we can better understand how to make Reveal right for you.
Our development team is hard at work and focused on optimizing our machine-learning algorithm and building out the app, and we are working on a licensing agreement with the top developer of physiological measurement hardware.
So far, we have been operating on a shoestring budget and still have made significant progress. The next step is to go from a working prototype to testing it and making sure it does exactly what it needs. After that, we need to go through manufacturing and then finally the distribution, which means Reveal in your hands.
We have support from experienced mentors who are helping us guide the development of Reveal. We are involved in the Coast Capital Savings Innovation Hub and the Next36 Accelerator to help us ensure that the transition from concept to finish product happens smoothly.
We are working to confirm our entire supply chain by the end of 2016. Our goal is to ship Reveal Version 1.0 to you by May of 2017.













 Our body’s nervous system automatically responds to physical, emotional, and cognitive stressors. For example, knowing you have a big test coming up, or hearing a loud noise can evoke nervous system reactions.
The autonomic nervous system responds to these stressors by activating the sympathetic nervous system, which results in a number of physiological and behavioural changes.
Reveal will measure and track a combination of the three leading physiological indicators of changes in anxiety as a result of these stressors.
These indicators are:



So, how exactly does this work?
When alerted, your sympathetic nervous system can activate certain sweat glands, resulting in “emotional sweat”. Electrodermal activity is a measure of change in skin conductance as a result of this “emotional sweat”. We will measure EDA through small electrical changes in the skin using two dry electrodes - a painless way of measuring EDA.
Your sympathetic nervous system also affects your circulatory system. When alerted by external stress, your heart rate will increase, and the diameter of your blood vessels will decrease. We can measure heart rate by shining a light on the skin and measuring the change in the light reflected as the blood pumps in and out of peripheral arteries. We can indirectly measure changes in blood vessel diameter by observing changes in skin temperature, which are tracked with a sensitive thermistor.
All of these sensors will be powered by a rechargeable Lithium-ion battery.
Reveal will identify the physiological patterns that relate to anxiety to give you more insight into what is happening internally.

 Reveal will go beyond physiological tracking - we are working with families to help us identify how to best track other types of behaviours, activities, and other useful information to provide a complete and individualized profile to better understand your child. 


 

Is Reveal made just for autism?
Reveal is not limited to ASDs. We're starting with the autism community to focus our initial design and data collection efforts. Once we get the wearable working well for this community we would love to use it for the variety of other purposes for which it could help provide insights. Other possible applications can include measuring stress for PTSD, generalized anxiety disorders, or for people with dementia.
Can Reveal work without the Reveal + subscription?
Yes, we will have a free version of the app available so that you can use Reveal at no monthly cost. The unlimited version will be available for only 9.99$/mo.
Who can use Reveal?
Right now, we’re designing Reveal for children with an ASD, their parents, caregivers and behavioural consultants because they are the ones already tracking and gathering the data we need to make Reveal most effective. That being said, Reveal will ultimately be used for self-regulation for autistic children, teenagers, and adults alike.  In the long term, we want this to be available to all those who need it, but we need to start in the right place.

How will Reveal help me identify what triggers anxiety for me/my child?
Identifying triggers of anxiety is a complicated process. We are starting this process in our current study by measuring physiological data and matching the recorded patterns to observed behaviours.
When Reveal becomes available, you will be able to go onto the app and tell it what’s happening in real time. As you are recording, you can go into the app and let it know where you are/what you’re doing, and provide details of the situation. Is your child laughing? Playing? Screaming?  What happened before? What is happening as a result? This way when you look back at the data, you will have access to all this information.But, as you use Reveal, it will get to know you and get smarter. So the next time it notices anxiety levels rise distinctly above the baseline you will get a notification with a simple prompt such as, “hey, I just noticed a spike, what’s up?” This will allow you to notice and contextualize each rise in anxiety the moment it happens.
Are you doing trials for Reveal? Can I/my child participate?Yes, we are conducting trials. The eligibility requirements for the current study are as follows:

Must be located in the lower mainland of British Columbia, Canada.
Must have an ASD diagnosis
Must not taking medication for anxiety regulation. Send a message to igg@awakelabs.com if you meet the above criteria. If you are interested in being considered for future studies, sign up for our mailing list through www.awakelabs.com

Why, “autistic person” rather than “person with autism” or “person with an ASD”?
We understand that this is a recurring topic of debate and in fact, we started this campaign using person first language. Since the launch we’ve received a number of emails from autistic individuals asking us about our choice in language and in light of these, we have changed it. We are constantly learning new things and are actively working to be the best possible allies to the community so if you have a concern please speak up!

For those who are a bit more curious, here are some fantastic blogs that have delved a little bit further into this discussion:

Is the device communicating only with the app or does it give any physical response directly?

Currently it will be communicating only with the app.  As we continue to develop Reveal as a tool for self-regulation, we will have a feature that gives the wearer an indication of heightened anxiety. This functionality will not be included in the first version of Reveal.
Is this device being marketed in different channels other than autism?Currently, no. We want to focus first on building this for the autistic community. Once it is working well,  we plan on scaling to other markets, such as dementia, PTSD and general anxiety.
Is there currently any testing being done in schools?Not specifically. A few trials have taken place with a child’s EA at school as it was the location indicated by certain participants to be the most familiar and comfortable to conduct the trials. So far, none of the testing has been specific to Reveal’s use in a school setting.
Are there any plans to expand capability to include GPS?Yes we will investigate the feasibility integrating GPS capabilities as it is a request we have gotten many times.
How does the device distinguish between excited and anxious as the two are physiologically very similar?Through the app you will be able to tag data with contextual information (example: is your child laughing or crying? Running and happy stimming, or quiet and withdrawn?) in order to help distinguish between the two. As Reveal gets more sophisticated and learns each individual user's patterns over time, it could differentiate between the two states.
Do you see this device being useful as a self-regulation tool?Yes definitely! Our ultimate goal is for this to be a tool for self regulation and to promote independence.
Will you be able to use autism funding to purchase the device?
This is something we are working on. We are looking to make Reveal as accessible as possible to those who need it. If you have any suggestions, contacts or if your country/state has any specific requirements please let us know!
When an event occurs, do you have to be trained how to read it or how to use the app?
We are designing it to be as simple and as comprehensible as possible. We will also provide access to tutorials and out-of-box instructions to teach you how to use some of the basic functions.

<h4>Wireless Monitoring of Your Equipment 24 hours a day<br/>
</h4>
Director Adam Everingham has been a chef in the food industry since 1979 and has worked in and owned some of Sydney's best Restaurants as well as working in fresh food distribution.<br/>Throughout these vast years of experience Adam saw a need for a better and more efficient way of monitoring temperatures, which started  him on a personal mission to set up a fool proof system to alleviate the constant disturbance of having to stop and write down temperatures while you are busy in the workplace. <br/><br/>He linked up with a highly recognised Electronic Engineer, who has extensive knowledge in the medical industry.<br/><br/>After thousands of man hours we have a system that can accommodate small surgeries &amp; restaurants, to large clubs, hotels &amp; hospitals, as well as monitor all devices in  large supermarket chains with separate manager logins .  One person can monitor as many outlets as needed from one PC or Phone.<br/><br/><b>OUR NEW PHONE APP</b>....<b>MONITOR TEMPERATURES ON YOUR SMART PHONE</b><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1182693/files/20150129131540-Smart_Probe_Phone_App.jpg?1422566140"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><h4>SAVE TIME AND MONEY ON STAFF COSTS<br/>
</h4>
<p> Having a 
staff member every 2 or 4 hours manually testing and logging the 
temperature of a fridge or freezer is time consuming and is open to human error.  Smart Probe alleviates this by automatically recording temperatures.<br/></p>
<p>Smart Probes temperatures are automatically logged, and once they are logged they are unable to be tampered with.</p>
<p>Your Auditor can have remote access to your temperature log which also saves time and money.</p>
<p>By being alerted via email or text of temperature spikes it allows you time to relocate stock before spoilage occurs which often saves thousands of dollars<br/></p>
<p>Having recorded temperatures which can't be tampered with shows the necessary due diligence if someone 
gets a food borne illness.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<br/><br/>
<h4>SAVING MONEY WITH SMART PROBE DIAGNOSTICS<br/>
</h4>
<p>Temperature alerts are highlighted on your PC as they occur. <br/></p>
<p>Where temperatures reach a critical point, an alert will be relayed by text message to your phone or email to
 nominated preset team members. <br/></p>
<p>Reacting promptly means food or medical vaccines can be saved by 
moving it elsewhere or by using it immediately. What is the value of the
 food you are storing?</p>
<h4></h4>
<b></b><p>You can collect and graph data that helps you save money and monitor 
possible costly breakdowns. Monitor doors left open from temperature 
spikes also highlights wasted energy, as well as out of hours

<p>Smart Probes Wireless Temperature Monitoring gives you fully 
encrypted temperature history and alert log reports in a graph form or 
line form. <br/></p>
<p>Monitor multiple probes from your PC or 
Smart Phone from one site or multiple sites around the world. Once generated 
the temperatures cannot be altered, which represents real evidence of due diligence.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Could you fully rely on your manual records if action was taken against 
you? Live access to your sites temperatures offers peace of 
mind knowing that your policies on temperature compliance are being met.</p>
<p>

Our Company
Wireless Monitoring of Your Equipment 24 hours a day

Director Adam Everingham has been a chef in the food industry since 1979 and has worked in and owned some of Sydney's best Restaurants as well as working in fresh food distribution.Throughout these vast years of experience Adam saw a need for a better and more efficient way of monitoring temperatures, which started  him on a personal mission to set up a fool proof system to alleviate the constant disturbance of having to stop and write down temperatures while you are busy in the workplace. He linked up with a highly recognised Electronic Engineer, who has extensive knowledge in the medical industry.After thousands of man hours we have a system that can accommodate small surgeries & restaurants, to large clubs, hotels & hospitals, as well as monitor all devices in  large supermarket chains with separate manager logins .  One person can monitor as many outlets as needed from one PC or Phone.OUR NEW PHONE APP....MONITOR TEMPERATURES ON YOUR SMART PHONE
SAVE TIME AND MONEY ON STAFF COSTS

 Having a 
staff member every 2 or 4 hours manually testing and logging the 
temperature of a fridge or freezer is time consuming and is open to human error.  Smart Probe alleviates this by automatically recording temperatures.
Smart Probes temperatures are automatically logged, and once they are logged they are unable to be tampered with.
Your Auditor can have remote access to your temperature log which also saves time and money.
By being alerted via email or text of temperature spikes it allows you time to relocate stock before spoilage occurs which often saves thousands of dollars
Having recorded temperatures which can't be tampered with shows the necessary due diligence if someone 
gets a food borne illness.



SAVING MONEY WITH SMART PROBE DIAGNOSTICS

Temperature alerts are highlighted on your PC as they occur. 
Where temperatures reach a critical point, an alert will be relayed by text message to your phone or email to
 nominated preset team members. 
Reacting promptly means food or medical vaccines can be saved by 
moving it elsewhere or by using it immediately. What is the value of the
 food you are storing?

You can collect and graph data that helps you save money and monitor 
possible costly breakdowns. Monitor doors left open from temperature 
spikes also highlights wasted energy, as well as out of hours 
temperature spikes relayed to your Smartphone or Email.









PROTECTING YOUR NAME AND REPUTATION

Smart Probes Wireless Temperature Monitoring gives you fully 
encrypted temperature history and alert log reports in a graph form or 
line form. 
Monitor multiple probes from your PC or 
Smart Phone from one site or multiple sites around the world. Once generated 
the temperatures cannot be altered, which represents real evidence of due diligence.

Could you fully rely on your manual records if action was taken against 
you? Live access to your sites temperatures offers peace of 
mind knowing that your policies on temperature compliance are being met.

 No more surprises or last minute worries when it's time for the monthly
 or annual audit. Your auditor can also receive updates to his Smartphone if
 necessary which saves time & money.

<br/>
<p>eMedica is a young IT company of dedicated engineers and business professionals 
who came together to create a <b>personal health record (PHR)</b> platform that is designed 
to empower patients everywhere to be in control of their own medical and health records.</p>
<p>Our focus is squarely fixed on providing the average person with the means of creating, 
organizing, and securely transporting their own personal health record (or the personal health 
record of someone in their care). A <b><i>personal</i></b> health record (PHR) is the complete collection of 
health and medical records maintained by the patient themself - as opposed to the various medical 
records held on the patient’s behalf at doctors’ offices or other care facilities.</p>
<p><b>Your personal health record is “<i>Your</i> health in <i>Your</i> hands”.</b></p>
<p>eMedica was formed to develop PHR technology that is easy to use and <b>NOT</b> stored on the “Cloud”.  We also offer 
related services such as assisting with medical records collection, document scanning, and helping clients to assemble their own PHR.</p>
<p>With interest growing from the general population to manage their own health and well-being, 
<b><i>personal</i></b> ownership of health records is becoming the norm both in North America and around the world.  
This is in keeping with other advancements in technology, especially in health IT so that, in the near future, 
we believe everyone will own and maintain some form of personal health record. This is useful for all, and especially for those individuals 
with chronic conditions, complicated medical histories, travellers and holidaymakers, and those who work in high-risk 
areas of employment. A PHR can be incredibly valuable in the event of a medical emergency.</p>
<p>The goal of this campaign is to combine eMedica's existing personal health record technology with 
the power and convenience of modern smartphones and tablets so that we can create the most helpful, and easy-to-use <b>personal health record mobile app</b> out there.</p>
<hr/>
<br/>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<br/>
<p>We would like to raise $75,000 to build the <b>personal health record mobile app</b> that puts your medical record and other 
health information at your fingertips and in your control.</p>
<p>With a <b>PHR mobile app</b> you can build and maintain your own PHR - or the PHR of someone in your care (children, grandparents, spouse, etc.) Quickly capture prescription information by taking a picture of the bottle’s label, or scan medical documents using your phone or tablet 
and have those documents automatically attach to your PHR.  And, any information collected using the mobile app will automatically synchronize 
with your <b>eMedica Card</b> (see later for details).</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<br/>
<p>eMedica is poised to advance personal health record technology for patients everywhere and our aim is to make it as easy, 
convenient and powerful as possible. But we need your help to get there! Everyone legally owns their own health and medical 
record information, but how do you get it?  Where do you put it once you have a copy of it? How do you keep it all organized? 
How do you store it securely? And how can you take it with you when on the move?</p>
<p>We’ve already addressed these questions with the existing eMedica <b>Card</b> application.  Now we’re looking to expand on our past 
successes and utilize the power and convenience of mobile devices.  Please help us make this happen by contributing to our campaign, 
and get started today on your own eMedica PHR <b>Card</b> app for PCs and laptops.  Later, you’ll receive a copy of the new <b>mobile app</b> as 
soon as it becomes available (expected release: early to mid 2016).</p>
<hr/>
<br/>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<br/>
<p>The new <b>PHR mobile app</b> brings together existing technologies and integrates them for PHR management in a unique and useful way.  
However, by utilizing proven existing technologies (such as optical character recognition, document scanning, image processing, etc.), 
and combining them with eMedica’s existing PHR <b>Card</b> app, the technical risks posed in undertaking this project have been minimized.  
Three issues that affect almost every new development project are time, money and scope (the range of selected features).  We intend to 
strictly limit the scope of this project to the features promised in this campaign plus those features selected from the feedback we 
receive from you.  Thereafter, the challenge becomes staying within budget and delivering on time and eMedica’s development and 
management teams already achieved this in developing our PHR <b>Card</b> app.  We have the experience, the track record and, with your help, 
we intend to do it again!</p>

<div><h3>Our Community Commitment to Youth</h3></div>
<br/>
<p>Currently, eMedica is developing a program for donating eMedica <b>Card</b>s to local sporting associations and teams. The goal is to provide 
young athletes with a means of tracking and recording details of any injuries, treatment or related therapies.  As a result of sports injuries, 
medical conditions frequently occur later in life and having the history readily at hand, complete with medications prescribed, X-rays, MRI scan 
data, etc., can play an important role in assisting with an accurate diagnosis later.  At any time, team members can access their full medical 
history on their eMedica PHR <b>Card</b> and this can be invaluable information if one is injured in another province, state or country. Let us know if you have a team we can help.</p>
<hr/>
<br/>
<div><h3>Thank You!</h3></div>
<br/>
<p>Our team at eMedica sincerely thanks you for your contribution and/or suggestions, both of which are very important to us. Without you, we 
will not be able to complete our project in a timely manner and get it tested and market ready. Using leading edge technology, we intend to put
 all eMedica clients in control of a very important aspect of their life - their personal health record. And to do so knowing that the privacy and
 protection of their personal health data is our #1 priority.</p>
<p>We are truly committed to putting “<b><i>Your</i> health in <i>Your</i> hands”.</b></p></div>","Who We Are and Why We're Here

eMedica is a young IT company of dedicated engineers and business professionals 
who came together to create a personal health record (PHR) platform that is designed 
to empower patients everywhere to be in control of their own medical and health records.
Our focus is squarely fixed on providing the average person with the means of creating, 
organizing, and securely transporting their own personal health record (or the personal health 
record of someone in their care). A personal health record (PHR) is the complete collection of 
health and medical records maintained by the patient themself - as opposed to the various medical 
records held on the patient’s behalf at doctors’ offices or other care facilities.
Your personal health record is “Your health in Your hands”.
eMedica was formed to develop PHR technology that is easy to use and NOT stored on the “Cloud”.  We also offer 
related services such as assisting with medical records collection, document scanning, and helping clients to assemble their own PHR.
With interest growing from the general population to manage their own health and well-being, 
personal ownership of health records is becoming the norm both in North America and around the world.  
This is in keeping with other advancements in technology, especially in health IT so that, in the near future, 
we believe everyone will own and maintain some form of personal health record. This is useful for all, and especially for those individuals 
with chronic conditions, complicated medical histories, travellers and holidaymakers, and those who work in high-risk 
areas of employment. A PHR can be incredibly valuable in the event of a medical emergency.
The goal of this campaign is to combine eMedica's existing personal health record technology with 
the power and convenience of modern smartphones and tablets so that we can create the most helpful, and easy-to-use personal health record mobile app out there.


What We Need & What You Get

We would like to raise $75,000 to build the personal health record mobile app that puts your medical record and other 
health information at your fingertips and in your control.
With a PHR mobile app you can build and maintain your own PHR - or the PHR of someone in your care (children, grandparents, spouse, etc.) Quickly capture prescription information by taking a picture of the bottle’s label, or scan medical documents using your phone or tablet 
and have those documents automatically attach to your PHR.  And, any information collected using the mobile app will automatically synchronize 
with your eMedica Card (see later for details).
The mobile app will be available as a free download and will support both iOS (iPhone and iPad) and Android devices. To make full use of the app, 
an eMedica account is required and this will be provided with each campaign contribution.
While we have our own ideas about how the app should look and work, we’d love to hear your ideas about how we can make it better. eMedica’s 
existing PHR Card application (for PC and laptop computers) was significantly improved by the feedback we received from our beta testers. 
Many suggestions we received were incorporated into the PC App, and we promise to do it again as we develop our PHR mobile app.  Please help us 
advance personal health record technology by contributing to our campaign and, for every donation of $50 or more, we’ll immediately send you an eMedica 
Card with pre-loaded PHR app for PC's and laptops (Windows, Mac, and Linux). Use it to create your own PHR today and, once the new mobile app is 
released, you’ll receive a copy of that as well (projected release timeframe is early to mid 2016).
Even if we don’t reach our $75,000 campaign goal, you’ll still receive an eMedica PHR Card and the eMedica mobile app may still be developed at a later time.


The Current eMedica Card and Personal Health Record App for PC's and Laptops

See below to view the eMedica Card you'll receive right away for donating to our
campaign! Just plug it in to any PC or laptop using its flip out USB connector.


The software runs directly off of the eMedica Card, and your personal health information is stored securely in encrypted form on the card.  You can take
 all your important health and medical information with you wherever you go - especially when travelling out of province or country.  The credit card sized
 eMedica Card easily fits into any wallet or purse.

Currently, eMedica is developing a program for donating eMedica Cards to local sporting associations and teams. The goal is to provide 
young athletes with a means of tracking and recording details of any injuries, treatment or related therapies.  As a result of sports injuries, 
medical conditions frequently occur later in life and having the history readily at hand, complete with medications prescribed, X-rays, MRI scan 
data, etc., can play an important role in assisting with an accurate diagnosis later.  At any time, team members can access their full medical 
history on their eMedica PHR Card and this can be invaluable information if one is injured in another province, state or country. Let us know if you have a team we can help.


Thank You!

Our team at eMedica sincerely thanks you for your contribution and/or suggestions, both of which are very important to us. Without you, we 
will not be able to complete our project in a timely manner and get it tested and market ready. Using leading edge technology, we intend to put
 all eMedica clients in control of a very important aspect of their life - their personal health record. And to do so knowing that the privacy and
 protection of their personal health data is our #1 priority.
We are truly committed to putting “Your health in Your hands”.",22.0,0,"1 Campaign

Current 10,000 Square feet of Premises Park
Premises Park was created by a group of local riders in Tucson, AZ  who volunteered countless hours of work building to help it grow over the last 4 years. The city of Tucson, population 1.6 million plus, has not provided a city park facility for all BMX, skateboarders, and freestyle scooters.

<b>HOW WE GOT HERE</b>
</h1><p>Twelve years ago we set out to improve the quality of our lives 
by living a healthier lifestyle.  Christian had seen half a dozen different doctors while trying to make sense of his degenerative shoulder and weak immune 
system.  For two years we had little success.  However, we just couldn't swallow the idea that he would never get better.  So we kept 
searching.  </p><p>It's amazing what a little tenacity can turn up.  Despite what all the professionals said, <b>he was able to heal his body without drugs or surgery.  </b>Along the way we met many others who had similar journeys.  What was the common thread?  They all realized there was no magic bullet, or single strategy they were missing.  It was a combination of a few key factors that made the difference, and it was those factors tweaked and repeated over time that compounded into great success.  In short, the ""secret"" we all learned was education, discipline, and seeking out well-rounded, on-going support. <br/></p><p>However, one other key ingredient was also common--""why power.""  Why Power (a bigger purpose to motivate disciplined action) is what fueled those we met, and us, to put in the hard work to follow through on the lifestyle changes we needed to make.  Seeing how change was truly possible, we became passionate about sharing what we learned and helping people find their unique motivation.  In fact, we became so inspired <b>we spent the last 10 years working together to develop a new, big picture,</b> <a href=""http://true-hw.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">integrated health/business model</a><a href=""http://true-hw.liveeditaurora.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a>. <b>  <br/></b></p> <p> </p><h1 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h1> <p>The money we are raising will allow us to renovate
 the space, get the word out about this game-changer model for health, and recruit the very best doctors, trainers, nutritionist, 
childcare professionals, and management team to meet our growing demand--some of our offerings are already wait-listed!     <br/></p><p>Thanks to our early TRUE believers who backed us the last few months, we're off to a <i>great</i> start raising money.  But <b>we have a short window of time</b> to secure the rest of the funds we need to see this project through to its full potential.  The second round of construction bids came back higher than the original so we need to raise $150K.  Here's a breakdown of what we still need: 

</p><p>                                                        <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443541474/p4hgdpif4zsq87azlcb2.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 194.957px; height: 588px;""/></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">From cool TRUE Gear, to your name on the Founders Wall in our new facility, to </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">LIFETIME</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> and </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">UNLIMITED</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">access to our services</b><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">, we are offering some sweet perks to our supporters.  Even if you're not local you can benefit from virtual access to our team who can help you stay healthy for the long haul.  Please check out our perks and think about how we can help you.    <br/></span></p><div> <h1 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h1>
<p>Partner with us to make a difference.  Over the course of the last decade we have worked with over 2,000 people in our community.  In our new facility we could easily match that number in one year!  In ten years we could personally impact 20,000+ people in just this one facility.  That's enough to start a grassroots movement...in the nation's capital no less.  </p>
We believe creating a better model for health is the best way to criticize the broken or enslaving systems that are harming the health of our nation.  By redefining health we will transform our neighborhood, open more facilities, play our part in reversing the insidious health trends in this country, and enhance the quality of our life that will impact generations to come.   <br/><p></p>

Who wouldn't want to be a part of that!  Please join us in showing the world there's a better way to approach health.  The more we raise, the sooner we will be able to help more people 
live up to their full potential!  Maybe one of those people is you.<br/><br/>

</div> <div> <h1 style=""text-align: center;"">Our Challenges</h1> <p>As ever-enthusiastic optimists, we always hope for the best, but we've stayed in business for 10+ years by also realistically assessing and addressing our risks.</p>
<p>While our competitors are concerned about market saturation, we see 
that as our greatest opportunity.  The boutique boom has created both a mass of options, and an industry-wide dilution of customer loyalty.  
Customers' needs change over time, and thus their loyalty to niche businesses wanes as their needs change.  By integrating so many niche businesses under one roof, having services that fit all stages of life, integrating them, and 
handsomely rewarding loyalty, we maintain a strategic advantage others cannot compete with.  <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>We also know in business, like life, sometimes we'll be forced to bounce back from the unexpected...like when a car crashed into our studio.   </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1443621348/qspux2aeuwmaopgu1g09.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
Through the ups and downs of the entrepreneur roller coaster, we developed a dogged determination and an uncommon resiliency, having overcome a flood, a fire, a car crash and 5 months of mysterious electrical problems.  We know there will always be risks, but the vision is too compelling to ever think about giving up...for our own sake, that of our children, and the many lives we will touch.  <br/><br/>

Feeling frustrated about losing weight and keeping it off. Perhaps you've tried all sorts of fitness and dietary programs and not had the success you were looking for.


Injured or in pain and antsy to ""get back in the game"" but need help knowing how you can heal and prevent injuries. 


Tired of going to umpteen different medical and alternative specialists and wished they could collaborate on your behalf and come up with better solutions.

Having trouble figuring out what to do, how to fit it in, and stay motivated. 
 Maybe you feel like you need a wise guide to sort through the mass of 
options, give you answers that adapt to your schedule, and keep you on 
track.
Wouldn't it be great if you could have a 
captain for ""Team YOU""?  Imagine having someone who makes sure you never lose sight of 
the big picture.  Imagine someone who helps coordinate all the players who have a stake in your and
 your family's health--a
 team captain who helps your doctor talk with your personal trainer about 
your fitness regimen, gets your massage therapist and 
acupuncturist on the same page so their treatment plans are complementary, and 
ensures your kids' fitness program director understands and 
supports the bigger dietary goals set by your nutritionist.  Imagine a place where services like this are bundled and less expensive than you think. ...WE'RE BUILDING A BUSINESS BUILT TO DO JUST THAT.  OUR VISION
It's
 time for:
TRUE-ly integrated and custom-made health programs, where niche businesses blend into a 
holistic, proactive, 
results-oriented model for wellness 
A health business that honors the individual and empowers a family's commitment to living a healthy lifestyle


Creating a movement that makes better health more accessible for 
everyone
It's time for a business that puts it all together:Click here to enlargeOur Tipping Point is NOW! We've worked on this vision for ten solid years and we'll stop 
at nothing to see this next step, our dream facility, become reality!  
We've outgrown our 
current location and are raising money to open a new facility--a unique, 10,000+ square foot, one-stop-shop that permanently and emphatically demonstrates a sustainable model for healthy living.  We'll be able to quickly increase our exercise offerings roughly 4X.  What kind of workout do you want?

accomplishing a goal, the discovery of new experiences, and be a place that provides opportunities to meet people's intrinsic need for connection.

TRANSFORM OUR CLIENTS' LIVES: Offer a holistic and sustainable model
 for enhancing the quality of people's lives through an integrated approach to fitness, food, wellness, and education.  

MAINTAIN INTEGRITY: No 
gimmicks. Teach the true principles of change--realistic, consistent, determined actions--that have a compounding effect when practiced over time. 
Our Competitive Advantage
While other 
businesses have been perfecting niche services, we have been perfecting 
our understanding of the big picture, and building a real-world model 
for the
integration of various health and fitness professionals into a team--Team YOU.  Health
 is about doing a lot of little things right, and to make change happen,
 you have to set yourself up for success.  Change is most likely when the environment is right: when you
 have a wise guide (a TRUE 
Advisor), a diverse team of specialists ready to collaborate to help 
you, and when you're surrounded by others working hard to become more 
than they are now.  This is a ""Way of Life"" model and we call the concept a Health Portfolio. 
 It's a simplified model for health where Advisors keep an eye on the 
big picture, where the spending of time and money is targeted, where 
specialists do their work, where meaningful relationships are forged, 
synergy is created, and the business offerings flex to your needs over 
time. By focusing on the big picture we:
Create customized solutions for individuals and families
Integrate care from a doctor into a bigger exercise, diet, and lifestyle program
Save our customers' time and money (no more driving all over town)
Help people overcome or prevent poor health
Make regular exercise something people look forward to 
Provide space where learning happens and where friendships are formed
Teach adults and children to cook 
Encourage healthy habits from childhood
Use company profits to implement a Give Back Program designed to 
give access our health, dietary, and fitness services to those who 
otherwise could not afford it

HOW WE GOT HERE
Twelve years ago we set out to improve the quality of our lives 
by living a healthier lifestyle.  Christian had seen half a dozen different doctors while trying to make sense of his degenerative shoulder and weak immune 
system.  For two years we had little success.  However, we just couldn't swallow the idea that he would never get better.  So we kept 
searching.  It's amazing what a little tenacity can turn up.  Despite what all the professionals said, he was able to heal his body without drugs or surgery.  Along the way we met many others who had similar journeys.  What was the common thread?  They all realized there was no magic bullet, or single strategy they were missing.  It was a combination of a few key factors that made the difference, and it was those factors tweaked and repeated over time that compounded into great success.  In short, the ""secret"" we all learned was education, discipline, and seeking out well-rounded, on-going support. However, one other key ingredient was also common--""why power.""  Why Power (a bigger purpose to motivate disciplined action) is what fueled those we met, and us, to put in the hard work to follow through on the lifestyle changes we needed to make.  Seeing how change was truly possible, we became passionate about sharing what we learned and helping people find their unique motivation.  In fact, we became so inspired we spent the last 10 years working together to develop a new, big picture, integrated health/business model.     What We Need & What You Get The money we are raising will allow us to renovate
 the space, get the word out about this game-changer model for health, and recruit the very best doctors, trainers, nutritionist, 
childcare professionals, and management team to meet our growing demand--some of our offerings are already wait-listed!     Thanks to our early TRUE believers who backed us the last few months, we're off to a great start raising money.  But we have a short window of time to secure the rest of the funds we need to see this project through to its full potential.  The second round of construction bids came back higher than the original so we need to raise $150K.  Here's a breakdown of what we still need: 

                                                        From cool TRUE Gear, to your name on the Founders Wall in our new facility, to LIFETIME and UNLIMITED access to our services, we are offering some sweet perks to our supporters.  Even if you're not local you can benefit from virtual access to our team who can help you stay healthy for the long haul.  Please check out our perks and think about how we can help you.     The Impact
Partner with us to make a difference.  Over the course of the last decade we have worked with over 2,000 people in our community.  In our new facility we could easily match that number in one year!  In ten years we could personally impact 20,000+ people in just this one facility.  That's enough to start a grassroots movement...in the nation's capital no less.  
We believe creating a better model for health is the best way to criticize the broken or enslaving systems that are harming the health of our nation.  By redefining health we will transform our neighborhood, open more facilities, play our part in reversing the insidious health trends in this country, and enhance the quality of our life that will impact generations to come.   

Who wouldn't want to be a part of that!  Please join us in showing the world there's a better way to approach health.  The more we raise, the sooner we will be able to help more people 
live up to their full potential!  Maybe one of those people is you.

  Our Challenges As ever-enthusiastic optimists, we always hope for the best, but we've stayed in business for 10+ years by also realistically assessing and addressing our risks.
While our competitors are concerned about market saturation, we see 
that as our greatest opportunity.  The boutique boom has created both a mass of options, and an industry-wide dilution of customer loyalty.  
Customers' needs change over time, and thus their loyalty to niche businesses wanes as their needs change.  By integrating so many niche businesses under one roof, having services that fit all stages of life, integrating them, and 
handsomely rewarding loyalty, we maintain a strategic advantage others cannot compete with.  

We also know in business, like life, sometimes we'll be forced to bounce back from the unexpected...like when a car crashed into our studio.   

Through the ups and downs of the entrepreneur roller coaster, we developed a dogged determination and an uncommon resiliency, having overcome a flood, a fire, a car crash and 5 months of mysterious electrical problems.  We know there will always be risks, but the vision is too compelling to ever think about giving up...for our own sake, that of our children, and the many lives we will touch.  
  Other Ways You Can Help Join us!  Even if you cannot contribute financially, please follow us on social media (share! retweet! repost!), and consider working with us virtually.  Help make some noise to get the word out to anyone and everyone who might help us launch this movement.  
Eventually, we hope to address your health needs with a TRUE Health & Wholeness facility in your neighborhood.  How cool would it be to know your support helped make that possible?

<p>Hello my name is Joan Mwanaka and I've recently started an exciting business for the interest of patient safety. <br/></p>
<p><span>Due to the plethora of rising life threatening si</span><span>de effects of our medicine, I am on a mission to make </span><span>our drugs safer. With my academic background and</span><span> work experience in drug safety, </span><span>medical writing as well as business, I feel ready to take this challenge head on!</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>After travelling to a few countries in Africa, it became apparent that the drug safety healthcare systems, particularly in </span><span>Pharmacovigilance</span><span> (drug safety) were not as robust as my home country, United Kingdom. </span></p>
<p><span>I took the burden upon myself to look into establishing and supporting drug safety in Africa as I did</span><span> in </span><span>the </span><span>United Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span><b>WHAT DOES DRUG SAFETY MEAN?</b></span></p>
<p>In a nutshell, it is the constant<b> monitoring</b> of our medicine to ensure it is beneficial and not harmful. Once drug safety measures are implemented (reporting of side effects), drugs can be further developed if needs be, new safety information can transpire, or if very dangerous, the drug can be withdrawn from the market.</p>
<p><span>Due to Pharmacovigilance, the following drugs were removed from the market:</span><span> </span></p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li><b>Thalidomide drugs caused neonatal birth defects</b></li>
<li><b>Alatrofloxacin caused liver toxicity and death </b></li>
<li><b>Prenyalmine caused cardiac arrhythmia and death</b></li>
</ol>
<div>
<p><span>Drug safety measures within pharmaceutical companies and regulatory authority bodies, ensured the drugs were monitored closely when they returned on the market.  </span></p>
<p>Every drug causes a side effect. Cancer drugs plus many others are highly toxic which begs the question: what are the unknown or under reported side effects they cause today? The lack of education on drug safety reporting can mean that the drugs we once thought were safe, as demonstrated in the list above, can in fact be life threatening. <b>Drug companies need to have reported information so they know how to closely monitor their drugs on the market in the interest of safety. </b></p>

Due to the strong </span><span>force of </span><span>Pharmacovigilance</span><span>, thalidomide was r</span><span>emoved from the market</span><span> and then revisited, is now used for the treatment of certain cancers. </span></p>
<p><span>Guess what, there are many more drugs on the market that need to be closely monitored, however, if </span><span>Pharmacovigilance</span><span> is not </span><span>pursued and implemented, the necessary </span><span>safety measures will suffer as a consequence.</span></p>

<p>The SugarCube Mobile App was designed to simplify the way diabetes test results are presented, collecting them into one easy to read and share location. But, we wanted to offer much more than a place for test results. As we listened to the challenges diabetics faced around the world, we identified additional areas that will help manage their condition. Including all of the following AND more:</p>

<h3>The SugarCube - Future of Diabetes Management </h3>
<p>We understand how difficult the added responsibilities of diabetes management can be. That's why we developed, The SugarCube, a complete diabetes lifestyle management system which will help people living with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes change the way they manage their condition to improve quality of life. </p>
<p><strong>What is The SugarCube</strong> <b>Management System: </b>The SugarCube is a Bluetooth® technology enabled glucose testing kit that supports insulin delivery and communicates with The SugarCube mobile app. The two work simultaneously to provide simpler diabetic lifestyle management.</p>
<p><strong>The SugarCube</strong>: An all-in-one glucose testing kit that supports insulin delivery for Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetics.</p>
<p><strong>The SugarCube App</strong>: A state-of-the-art mobile application and website that receives a users personal health data from The SugarCube kit. The SugarCube application enables users to make healthier lifestyle decisions based on their personal historical health data and reports directly to your doctor's office.</p>

<p>We have a prototype device and mobile app that is designed to measure and track your glucose levels, physical activities, food &amp; restaurant choices, and more. However, before The SugarCube can become a medical device it will have to go through the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) premarket notification process. This is where your help and support comes in!</p>
<p>Disclaimer: The SugarCube has not been cleared or approved by FDA. The information provided on this page is The SugarCube’s vision of the final design that will be subject to FDA approval prior to it's availability. As a contributor to this Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign, you are supporting The SugarCube’s next steps to bring a revolutionary all-in-one glucometer with insulin delivery to market.</p>

<p>Since 2009, Johnnie Refvik, CEO and Founder of Refvik Technologies joined roughly 285 million people battling some form of diabetes. Over the next few years, that number drastically increased by more than 100 million people globally. Unfortunately, there’s still no ‘cure’ for diabetes yet so the only option for people living with diabetes is management. This is why we came up with The SugarCube lifestyle management system. </p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Next Steps With Your Support</h3>
<p>Our goal is to put The SugarCube diabetes lifestyle management system into the hands of every diabetic we can so that they can live happier, healthier and longer lives. We see our system making a world of difference to the diabetic community. Through a successful Indiegogo campaign, we will finalize the electronic components of the all-inclusive testing device. This will include custom glucometer, test strips and lancets. </p>
<p>Additionally, we will complete tooling, manufacturing and inventory. We will also finalize The SugarCube Mobile app on both iOS and Android platforms. Together our test kit and mobile app will change how diabetics manage their daily BG levels via a easy to use system.</p>

The SugarCube Mobile App was designed to simplify the way diabetes test results are presented, collecting them into one easy to read and share location. But, we wanted to offer much more than a place for test results. As we listened to the challenges diabetics faced around the world, we identified additional areas that will help manage their condition. Including all of the following AND more:



The SugarCube cloud storage backend uses industry standard SSL technology toencrypt and secure YOUR data. Secure access to The SugarCube data on mobile phones via unique user identification, password and fingerprint options. Encryption of all the data which is stored on mobile devices as well as HIPAA compliant cloud server.










The SugarCube - Future of Diabetes Management 
We understand how difficult the added responsibilities of diabetes management can be. That's why we developed, The SugarCube, a complete diabetes lifestyle management system which will help people living with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes change the way they manage their condition to improve quality of life. 
What is The SugarCube Management System: The SugarCube is a Bluetooth® technology enabled glucose testing kit that supports insulin delivery and communicates with The SugarCube mobile app. The two work simultaneously to provide simpler diabetic lifestyle management.
The SugarCube: An all-in-one glucose testing kit that supports insulin delivery for Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetics.
The SugarCube App: A state-of-the-art mobile application and website that receives a users personal health data from The SugarCube kit. The SugarCube application enables users to make healthier lifestyle decisions based on their personal historical health data and reports directly to your doctor's office.





The SugarCube test kit is compatible with nine Flexpen© style insulin delivery devices, and we have our research team looking to add more to that list. Please contact us know if you don't see your insulin delivery pen on the list and we'll work hard to get it there! Email: info@TheSugarCubeApp.com


We have a prototype device and mobile app that is designed to measure and track your glucose levels, physical activities, food & restaurant choices, and more. However, before The SugarCube can become a medical device it will have to go through the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) premarket notification process. This is where your help and support comes in!
Disclaimer: The SugarCube has not been cleared or approved by FDA. The information provided on this page is The SugarCube’s vision of the final design that will be subject to FDA approval prior to it's availability. As a contributor to this Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign, you are supporting The SugarCube’s next steps to bring a revolutionary all-in-one glucometer with insulin delivery to market.















Since 2009, Johnnie Refvik, CEO and Founder of Refvik Technologies joined roughly 285 million people battling some form of diabetes. Over the next few years, that number drastically increased by more than 100 million people globally. Unfortunately, there’s still no ‘cure’ for diabetes yet so the only option for people living with diabetes is management. This is why we came up with The SugarCube lifestyle management system. 



Next Steps With Your Support
Our goal is to put The SugarCube diabetes lifestyle management system into the hands of every diabetic we can so that they can live happier, healthier and longer lives. We see our system making a world of difference to the diabetic community. Through a successful Indiegogo campaign, we will finalize the electronic components of the all-inclusive testing device. This will include custom glucometer, test strips and lancets. 
Additionally, we will complete tooling, manufacturing and inventory. We will also finalize The SugarCube Mobile app on both iOS and Android platforms. Together our test kit and mobile app will change how diabetics manage their daily BG levels via a easy to use system.

Common global water-related diseases caused by parasites include <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/guineaworm/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Guinea worm</a>, <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/schistosomiasis/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">schistosomiasis</a>, amebiasis, <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/crypto/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">cryptosporidiosis (Crypto)</a>, and <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/giardia/index.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">giardiasis</a>. People become infected with these diseases when they swallow or have contact with water that has been contaminated by certain parasites. For example, individuals drinking water contaminated with fecal matter containing the ameba <em>Entamoeba histolytica</em> can get amebic dysentery (amebiasis). An individual can get Guinea worm disease when they drink water that contains the parasite <em>Dracunculus medinensis</em>. If an infected person with an open Guinea worm wound enters a pond or well used for drinking water, they can spread the parasite into the water and continue the cycle of contamination and infection. Schistosomiasis can be spread when people swim in or have contact with freshwater lakes that are contaminated with <em>Schistosoma</em> parasites.</b></div>
<div><b>Water is an essential resource for life. Water is used by everyone, every day.

I am the founder of Strictly Biblical International Ministry.
Recently I went on a mission trip to Africa, to visit two ministries that ""Strictly Biblical Bible Teaching Ministries"" support.
 The mission was from August 28 - September 8, 2015. The reason for the mission trip was to assess the need and to personally meet with the brethren there.
The needs are great  in Zambia and South African  In Lusaka, Zambia in a village named Mungulu the people are drinking dirty water and dying from it. In Meyerton South Africa the Lakeside Orphanage, the children need a table so they can sit down and eat their meals. They also need beds and clothing. In Zambia there is a school ""Firm Foundation Christian Academy"" where the children are learning from out dated and torn books and they only have a meager structure for learning and are in need of other basic things.                                                  They truly need our help.


Priorities
One of our priorities is clean water. Globally, contaminated water is a serious problem that can cause severe pain, disability and even death. Common global water-related diseases caused by parasites include Guinea worm, schistosomiasis, amebiasis, cryptosporidiosis (Crypto), and giardiasis. People become infected with these diseases when they swallow or have contact with water that has been contaminated by certain parasites. For example, individuals drinking water contaminated with fecal matter containing the ameba Entamoeba histolytica can get amebic dysentery (amebiasis). An individual can get Guinea worm disease when they drink water that contains the parasite Dracunculus medinensis. If an infected person with an open Guinea worm wound enters a pond or well used for drinking water, they can spread the parasite into the water and continue the cycle of contamination and infection. Schistosomiasis can be spread when people swim in or have contact with freshwater lakes that are contaminated with Schistosoma parasites.
Water is an essential resource for life. Water is used by everyone, every day. Not only do all people need drinking water to survive, but water plays an important role in almost every aspect of our lives. – from recreation to manufacturing computers to performing medical procedures. When water becomes contaminated by parasites, however, it can cause a variety of illnesses.

                  
                      What We Need & What You Get To break it down in more detail for you:
 We need 5,000.00 to dig and put in a well in Mungulu.
We need 1,000.00 for the table/chairs and beds for the Orphanage in South Africa  We need 2,000.00 to help supply the school so the children can get a better education in Zambia. More than 95% of the funds go to Africa. Even if we don't reach our goal it will go to Africa to help where it is needed most.
For every donation of $30.00 or more you get an ""I Support Strictly Biblical International Ministry"" T-Shirt

For  a donation of 40.00 or more you will receive a T- Shirt and a picture of the well and the school and or the orphanage of what your $$ did.


                   


                                    The Impact When you give, you will be saving lives and giving people a better life. Help educate and help people to help them selves. Also show our christian love to help the needy and feed the poor and give a hand up and not a hand out.
Here are other things that you will be helping with:  You are helping to provide better accommodations for a better education. All projects are put into action as soon as funds are received. You are making life better for orphans, so they can be assets to their communities and know that others care.

                                            
                                              What we have done
               Since we have been supporting these two ministries, we have:


Sent clothes, bibles,toys, medicine, crayons, coloring books, toothbrushes and more in South Africa
Helped re build apart of the orphanage that caught fire in South Africa
Fed children at an orphanage in Lusaka, Zambia
Helped to purchase the desk and chairs that you see in the picture above in Lusaka
Fed the children in the orphanage also help with the feeding program at CRM in South Africa

                                Risks & Challenges Some people are leery about giving donations to causes in Africa because they are not sure it will get there or that it will be used for what the organization says it will be used for.
I promise that 95- 99% of your dollars donated will go towards these causes. I have been there and will be going back. Also the Pastor's of the churches there are honest God fearing reliable men with wonderful and humble mates that keep me updated and informed.
                      Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Help us get the word out and make some noise about the campaign. Tell friends and family.
Use Face Book, Twitter and any other social media.
Maybe you know of businesses that would like to help a worthy cause.

</h3><h3>
</h3><p>Animal shelters and rescues are flooded with abused animals
every year.  Many of these animals
require treatment for wounds.  Quickderm
is a patented formulation with high efficacy and developed after years of
research.  Donate now and we will send
Quickderm in your name to an animal shelter or rescue of your choice.  The shelter can utilize the product to heal
the animals and send product home with the new owners of the pet.  Also, you can donate and receive Quickderm
for your own animals.</p><p>This is Gabby.  She was set on fire by a group of teenagers in Dallas, Texas and thrown into a dumpster.  Quickderm healed her as you will see in the below pictures!<br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459348585/ithsv5kg6b0vtz8lsg8w.png"" src="""" style=""width: 241.413px;height: 201px;""/>  <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1461077510/Gabby_after_hibhxy.png"" src="""" style=""width: 302.098px;height: 202px;""/></p><p><br/></p><h3>HEALING HUMANS TOO<br/>
</h3>This campaign not only helps animals, but humans too.  We are raising funds to bring this technology to market for the healing of human ulcers.  Our business plan is outlined further down the page, but first we want to share the need for abused animals!<br/><br/><h3>ANIMAL ABUSE IS A HUGE ISSUE</h3>According to the National Humane Society website: unlike violent crimes against people, information on
reported cases of animal abuse have not been compiled by state and federal
agencies, making it difficult to calculate the prevalence or trends in these
crimes.  In 2014, the FBI announced that
it will add cruelty to animals as a category in the agency’s Uniform Crime
Report, a nationwide crime-reporting system. While only about a third of U.S.
communities currently participate in the system, the data generated will help
create a clearer picture of animal abuse and guide strategies for intervention
and enforcement. Data collection will begin in January 2016 and will cover four
categories: simple/gross neglect, intentional abuse and torture, organized
abuse (such as dogfighting and cockfighting) and animal sexual abuse.  <br/><p>Up to now, statistics on animal abuse have
been collected by private organizations. 
According to Pet-Abuse.Com and the AARDAS project, a high percentage of
abuse is from neglect.  The below table
details their compiled statistics on abuse types and as you can see, the
majority of abuse would produce wounds requiring treatment with Quickderm!</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458750180/p6ylsiv0dwaoxzn0m8do.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>Abuse affects many types of animals from pets at home to
horses and farm animals.  Below is a
chart showing the incidence of abuse by animal type and Quickderm can help all
of them!</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458750212/mnng4efs6oo1ee1wo0lp.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>As with many medicines, the original source of that medicine
originates from plants.  The Quickderm
formulation originates from an old recipe in which red oak bark was burned into
ashes and used on wounds.  The oak bark
treatment was studied and synthesized into the five key chemical components
that effect wound healing.  Quickderm
heals at the molecular level and we want to take this formulation to the human
market as will be described below.</p>

<p><b>DON’T TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT, READ WHAT OTHERS ARE
SAYING…</b></p>
<p>I just received my VetCare QuickDerm! It’s
absolutely the best wound ointment I have ever found for my 2 senior dogs, both
9lb. Chihuahuas. Within days of my husband’s unexpected death a few years ago,
I noticed a small bleeding spot on my Duke’s front leg. As I watched his behavior,
he would stare at the front door waiting for his ‘Dad’ to walk in. The longer
he watched the door, the more he licked that spot. My then vet recommended
QuickDerm and gave me a small tube of it. In a day, the healing started! The
wound was dry within days and the skin recovered within a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Since then, Duke has, from time to time, licked spots on himself
but they’ve never been as bad as the first one due to the wonderful QUICK
results of QuickDerm!!!</p>
<p>Thank you!<br/>

<p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>“Just wanted to say thanks for the QuickDerm
wound ointment! It really did the trick on her TPLO (ACL knee surgery)
incision. It was weepy, swollen and red for the 1st couple of weeks. I started
using the ointment after her compression bandage was removed and by 6 weeks
post surgery you couldn’t even see the incision. I think it made all the
difference in how her wound healed. I also used the last of it on her elbow
calluses as these had gotten irritated due to all of her “down time”.</p>
<p>Thanks again. We really appreciate your thoughtfulness.”<br/>

seem to constantly get pictures because they are in shock of how great the
wound looks in such a short period of time. From severe open wounds with bone
exposure (I deal with lots of feral cats!), to degloving injuries, ulcerated
masses on rats, necrotic skin lesions in reptiles….this is my GO TO ointmen!
Love it!”</p>

<p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>I handle the adoptable strays that make their way into our
practice. We recently took in a small hound mix which had leather-like skin and
was missing fur from about 80% of her body. After several baths, she became so
itchy that even with the application of various topical creams, she scratched
herself open last Tuesday (9 days ago). The open wound was bleeding and
measured about 6” by 1.” Recently, our PennVet sales rep introduced me to your
ointment. The wound healed within two days of my applying the QuickDerm, and
her fur is already growing back. She has some of the most severe skin issues we
have ever experienced. The owner of the practice, Karin-Susan Breitlauch DVM,
has been a veterinarian for 25 years and is extremely impressed with the
effectiveness of your product. We are a 24-7 emergency clinic and expect to be
trying your ointment and spray on a number of wound care issues in the near
future. It is not often that we are able to leave such positive feedback about
a new product and are certainly happy to do so.<br/>

<p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>I am writing to let you know how pleased we are with your product
QuickDerm. We have used it in our veterinary practice for wound management and
have seen incredible results. Also we have used it for topical treatment of two
patients with inoperable skin tumors. One patient is “Pearl Rose” Hutchins, a
16 year old Bichon Frise with a sebaceous epithelioma with perivascular
dermatitis. Application of QuickDerm temporarily shrunk the tumor.<br/>
Another patient a 9 year old Siberian Husky “Star” Beard had an elbow mass
diagnosed as low grade spindle cell tumor most consistent with
hemangiopericytoma. Application of QuikDerm caused about a 50% shrinkage in the
tumor. Unfortunately this pet was euthanized because of a nasal tumor.<br/>
I have also have personal experience with the use of your product in the
management of exuberant granulation tissue (“proud flesh”) in one of our
horses. It worked very well.</p>

<p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Hello!<br/>
I attended the SWVS in October in San Antonio, TX and received a sample of this
product. I have used it on one of my personal pets and was extremely impressed.
It cut the healing time in half for anything else I have used. Although
obviously not labeled for such use, I put a small amount on an open wound that
I had, to see if it stung upon application, and was very impressed that it did
not (very minute sting for the first second, but went away quickly). I have
relayed all of this, including the small amount of product needed, to our
Dermatologist who just started with us about 2.5 months ago. She is very
interested in trying it. She sees small animal (dogs and cats) and horses.</p>

<p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>“I have had numerous opportunities to use the QuickDerm tube that
you sent home with me on horses, and as you knew I would be, I am amazed! I
have used it on 2 deep cuts, and was able to witness the inuries and apply
immediately. By the next day the wounds were closed and by day 2, I honestly
would not have believed there had been injuries in the animals if it had not
been for the blood still streaked on one horse’s face from the initial insult!”</p>
<p>Dr. Sue Whiteman, DVM (Indiana)</p>
<p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>“We are a non-profit equine rescue and we house and care for 60-80
horses at any one time. The horses live outside in herds in large pastures with
tree, ponds and varying terrain. Horses being horses, we regularly have a variety
of wounds to deal with.</p>
<p>I purchased a 4 oz. tube of VetCare EquiDerm Advanced Wound
Ointment at the NAVC in January this year. We have been using it on the horses
here at the Horse Protection Association of Florida over the past four months.
We have used it on lacerations, sunburn and rain rot. I am very impressed with
this product; we have seen excellent results on every wound we have used it on.
One 2 yr. old TB colt had a small but deep laceration that looked like he may
have run into a nail protruding from the fence. The wound was washed once and
the EquiDerm AWO applied once daily. The wound healed quickly with no proud
flesh or scarring which is impressive because this colt was emaciated and its
immune system compromised.</p>
<p>EquiDerm AWO has worked beautifully on the sunburned pink noses
from the scorching Florida sun and the rain rot that came on quickly after
seven straight days and 20 inches of rain in late May. We truly appreciate
having a wound ointment that works so effectively and makes our jobs caring for
the horses a little bit easier.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br/>

<p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>“I have used QuickDerm on several cases and been very impressed
with its ability to accelerate healing – particularly in c hronic wounds. I
recently used it on an axillary pocket wound in a clinic blood donor cat that
had been present for weeks and failed other treatments. In just a few days the
wound was 50% smaller and had a nice rim of new granulation tissue. At 2 weeks,
the entire wound was filled with granulation tissue and it was only 25% of its
original size. The wound was then surgically closed and healed beautifully.
QuickDerm did wonders for this cat’s wound, when nothing else was working – now
I reach for QuickDerm first!”</p>
<p>Rebecca M. Stanclift, DVM<br/>

<p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Dear VetCare,<br/>
I’m writing to let you know that I am extraordinarily pleased with your
product, which I use on my hawks and falcons’ feet.</p>
<p>One health problem common to larger birds of prey is a condition
called “bumblefoot.” Bumblefoot is essentially caused by pressure on a raptor’s
delicate feet, often in combination with an injury (such as a squirrel bite
incurred while hunting) or prolonged periods of inactivity (such as with
injured, captive-kept and rehab birds). Bumblefoot is similar in nature to
pressure ulcers and can be an absolute nightmare to resolve once it occurs, so
prevention and proactively addressing any foot injuries is really the best
“cure.” This is where your product really excels.</p>
<p>When one of my birds incurs a squirrel bite to the foot or toes, I
first clean the wound site by gently scrubbing with warm soapy water and a
toothbrush to remove any dirt or debris, then I irrigate the wound site with
70% isopropyl alcohol to disinfect it. Next, I wrap a narrow perch with a piece
of pastic cut from a contractor’s garbage bag and tape it into place on the
perch. I then slather the top of the plastic-wrapped perch with your product
and place the bird on it. Every time the bird moves on the perch, it
self-medicates its feet. Over the course of the night, the bird may medicate
itself dozens of times as it changes position while sleeping–it’s that easy!</p>
<p>Since using this method and your product, I have not had a single
bird develop bumblefoot and all squirrel bites – even the particularly nasty
ones – have healed completely.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br/>
Mike Bodary<br/>
Federally Licensed Master Falconer</p>
<p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>“QuickDerm is a wonderful product and I was amazed with the
results. Max (our dog) also has diabeties, which makes the healing process
especially difficult. But after applying QuickDerm for one week directly to his
wound; well, the results speak for themselves! I love my dog and could not bare
to see him suffer and I am so thankful there is a product on the market that
yields such miraculous results.”</p>
<p>Warm regards,<br/>
Jeff McGahee</p>
<p><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>“I had tried two other products prior to using QuickDerm and they
were not giving me any results. I began using QuickDerm and noticed a change
within three days after the first application. There were six applications and
not much of the product was needed to cover the wound. The result of QuickDerm
speaks for itself. I will continue to use the product and recommend it to

This campaign is operated by Metrix Medical,
Inc..<span>  Quickderm is a product of Vetcare,
Inc. and has licensed the technology to Metrix for use on human ulcers.  The primary principals of Vetcare are also
principals in Metrix. Human ulcers
develop from various disease states such as diabetes, venous stasis disease,
paralysis and inactivity.  The healing of
wounds in humans and animals are very similar. 
Below is a chart of the phases of healing. </span><br/><br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1458751002/vvtgfmg7l6fww2g8vhoa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>The healing time for wounds is effected by how the wound is
treated.  In humans with disease states
such as diabetes, the healing process stalls as a result of ineffective
molecular activity.  The Quickderm
formulation balances the wound bed molecular activity to allow the wound to go
thru all the phases of healing.  This formulation
was recently used by a podiatrist on foot ulcer patient and stated “this is the
best improvement he’s had in 1 year”!  As
you can see from the below pictures, the wound improved in about 3 weeks!!</p>

Animal shelters and rescues are flooded with abused animals
every year.  Many of these animals
require treatment for wounds.  Quickderm
is a patented formulation with high efficacy and developed after years of
research.  Donate now and we will send
Quickderm in your name to an animal shelter or rescue of your choice.  The shelter can utilize the product to heal
the animals and send product home with the new owners of the pet.  Also, you can donate and receive Quickderm
for your own animals.This is Gabby.  She was set on fire by a group of teenagers in Dallas, Texas and thrown into a dumpster.  Quickderm healed her as you will see in the below pictures!  HEALING HUMANS TOO
This campaign not only helps animals, but humans too.  We are raising funds to bring this technology to market for the healing of human ulcers.  Our business plan is outlined further down the page, but first we want to share the need for abused animals!ANIMAL ABUSE IS A HUGE ISSUEAccording to the National Humane Society website: unlike violent crimes against people, information on
reported cases of animal abuse have not been compiled by state and federal
agencies, making it difficult to calculate the prevalence or trends in these
crimes.  In 2014, the FBI announced that
it will add cruelty to animals as a category in the agency’s Uniform Crime
Report, a nationwide crime-reporting system. While only about a third of U.S.
communities currently participate in the system, the data generated will help
create a clearer picture of animal abuse and guide strategies for intervention
and enforcement. Data collection will begin in January 2016 and will cover four
categories: simple/gross neglect, intentional abuse and torture, organized
abuse (such as dogfighting and cockfighting) and animal sexual abuse.  Up to now, statistics on animal abuse have
been collected by private organizations. 
According to Pet-Abuse.Com and the AARDAS project, a high percentage of
abuse is from neglect.  The below table
details their compiled statistics on abuse types and as you can see, the
majority of abuse would produce wounds requiring treatment with Quickderm!

Abuse affects many types of animals from pets at home to
horses and farm animals.  Below is a
chart showing the incidence of abuse by animal type and Quickderm can help all
of them!

As with many medicines, the original source of that medicine
originates from plants.  The Quickderm
formulation originates from an old recipe in which red oak bark was burned into
ashes and used on wounds.  The oak bark
treatment was studied and synthesized into the five key chemical components
that effect wound healing.  Quickderm
heals at the molecular level and we want to take this formulation to the human
market as will be described below.

SAYING…
I just received my VetCare QuickDerm! It’s
absolutely the best wound ointment I have ever found for my 2 senior dogs, both
9lb. Chihuahuas. Within days of my husband’s unexpected death a few years ago,
I noticed a small bleeding spot on my Duke’s front leg. As I watched his behavior,
he would stare at the front door waiting for his ‘Dad’ to walk in. The longer
he watched the door, the more he licked that spot. My then vet recommended
QuickDerm and gave me a small tube of it. In a day, the healing started! The
wound was dry within days and the skin recovered within a couple of weeks.
Since then, Duke has, from time to time, licked spots on himself
but they’ve never been as bad as the first one due to the wonderful QUICK
results of QuickDerm!!!
Thank you!
Jan Forrester
I ordered your product for my sugar glider who
had a dominance wound, as it was recommended to me versus vetericyn for which I
normally use…vetericyn usually takes about two weeks to heal our wounds…your
product took one week! It’s amazing and I wanted you to know. Below I have
attached what it looked like and now it’s completely gone. Thank you for this
product 
A very satisfied customer
Stephanie Paquette
Thank you Mikel! I really appreciate your
awesome customer service and you shipping that out so quickly! So does my coned
dog Samantha. Getting that ointment means faster healing and less time in the
cone of shame. She’s miserable with that silly thing on. Ha ha! Have a great
night!

“Just wanted to say thanks for the QuickDerm
wound ointment! It really did the trick on her TPLO (ACL knee surgery)
incision. It was weepy, swollen and red for the 1st couple of weeks. I started
using the ointment after her compression bandage was removed and by 6 weeks
post surgery you couldn’t even see the incision. I think it made all the
difference in how her wound healed. I also used the last of it on her elbow
calluses as these had gotten irritated due to all of her “down time”.
Thanks again. We really appreciate your thoughtfulness.”

“QuickDerm is in every vehicle, medicine
cabinet, and I give it to all my clients to try. Super product!
Walter Varcoe, Farrier

“I am ever grateful to have come across this
product at an IVECCS a year ago. I’ve used it on MANY wounds and it has been
amazing! My clients have been nothing short of super happy with this product. I
seem to constantly get pictures because they are in shock of how great the
wound looks in such a short period of time. From severe open wounds with bone
exposure (I deal with lots of feral cats!), to degloving injuries, ulcerated
masses on rats, necrotic skin lesions in reptiles….this is my GO TO ointmen!
Love it!”

“The Neighborhood Vet”
I handle the adoptable strays that make their way into our
practice. We recently took in a small hound mix which had leather-like skin and
was missing fur from about 80% of her body. After several baths, she became so
itchy that even with the application of various topical creams, she scratched
herself open last Tuesday (9 days ago). The open wound was bleeding and
measured about 6” by 1.” Recently, our PennVet sales rep introduced me to your
ointment. The wound healed within two days of my applying the QuickDerm, and
her fur is already growing back. She has some of the most severe skin issues we
have ever experienced. The owner of the practice, Karin-Susan Breitlauch DVM,
has been a veterinarian for 25 years and is extremely impressed with the
effectiveness of your product. We are a 24-7 emergency clinic and expect to be
trying your ointment and spray on a number of wound care issues in the near
future. It is not often that we are able to leave such positive feedback about
a new product and are certainly happy to do so.
Sincerely,

I have had the opportunity to use QuickDerm on several cases
including minor wounds and several skin diseases. I have been very happy with
the results and the performance of this product. I look forward to using it on
many more cases.

I am writing to let you know how pleased we are with your product
QuickDerm. We have used it in our veterinary practice for wound management and
have seen incredible results. Also we have used it for topical treatment of two
patients with inoperable skin tumors. One patient is “Pearl Rose” Hutchins, a
16 year old Bichon Frise with a sebaceous epithelioma with perivascular
dermatitis. Application of QuickDerm temporarily shrunk the tumor.
Another patient a 9 year old Siberian Husky “Star” Beard had an elbow mass
diagnosed as low grade spindle cell tumor most consistent with
hemangiopericytoma. Application of QuikDerm caused about a 50% shrinkage in the
tumor. Unfortunately this pet was euthanized because of a nasal tumor.
I have also have personal experience with the use of your product in the
management of exuberant granulation tissue (“proud flesh”) in one of our
horses. It worked very well.

Hello!
I attended the SWVS in October in San Antonio, TX and received a sample of this
product. I have used it on one of my personal pets and was extremely impressed.
It cut the healing time in half for anything else I have used. Although
obviously not labeled for such use, I put a small amount on an open wound that
I had, to see if it stung upon application, and was very impressed that it did
not (very minute sting for the first second, but went away quickly). I have
relayed all of this, including the small amount of product needed, to our
Dermatologist who just started with us about 2.5 months ago. She is very
interested in trying it. She sees small animal (dogs and cats) and horses.

“I have had numerous opportunities to use the QuickDerm tube that
you sent home with me on horses, and as you knew I would be, I am amazed! I
have used it on 2 deep cuts, and was able to witness the inuries and apply
immediately. By the next day the wounds were closed and by day 2, I honestly
would not have believed there had been injuries in the animals if it had not
been for the blood still streaked on one horse’s face from the initial insult!”
Dr. Sue Whiteman, DVM (Indiana)
“We are a non-profit equine rescue and we house and care for 60-80
horses at any one time. The horses live outside in herds in large pastures with
tree, ponds and varying terrain. Horses being horses, we regularly have a variety
of wounds to deal with.
I purchased a 4 oz. tube of VetCare EquiDerm Advanced Wound
Ointment at the NAVC in January this year. We have been using it on the horses
here at the Horse Protection Association of Florida over the past four months.
We have used it on lacerations, sunburn and rain rot. I am very impressed with
this product; we have seen excellent results on every wound we have used it on.
One 2 yr. old TB colt had a small but deep laceration that looked like he may
have run into a nail protruding from the fence. The wound was washed once and
the EquiDerm AWO applied once daily. The wound healed quickly with no proud
flesh or scarring which is impressive because this colt was emaciated and its
immune system compromised.
EquiDerm AWO has worked beautifully on the sunburned pink noses
from the scorching Florida sun and the rain rot that came on quickly after
seven straight days and 20 inches of rain in late May. We truly appreciate
having a wound ointment that works so effectively and makes our jobs caring for
the horses a little bit easier.
Sincerely,
Morgan Silver, Executive Director
Horse Protection Association of Florida”
“I have used QuickDerm on several cases and been very impressed
with its ability to accelerate healing – particularly in c hronic wounds. I
recently used it on an axillary pocket wound in a clinic blood donor cat that
had been present for weeks and failed other treatments. In just a few days the
wound was 50% smaller and had a nice rim of new granulation tissue. At 2 weeks,
the entire wound was filled with granulation tissue and it was only 25% of its
original size. The wound was then surgically closed and healed beautifully.
QuickDerm did wonders for this cat’s wound, when nothing else was working – now
I reach for QuickDerm first!”

Dear VetCare,
I’m writing to let you know that I am extraordinarily pleased with your
product, which I use on my hawks and falcons’ feet.
One health problem common to larger birds of prey is a condition
called “bumblefoot.” Bumblefoot is essentially caused by pressure on a raptor’s
delicate feet, often in combination with an injury (such as a squirrel bite
incurred while hunting) or prolonged periods of inactivity (such as with
injured, captive-kept and rehab birds). Bumblefoot is similar in nature to
pressure ulcers and can be an absolute nightmare to resolve once it occurs, so
prevention and proactively addressing any foot injuries is really the best
“cure.” This is where your product really excels.
When one of my birds incurs a squirrel bite to the foot or toes, I
first clean the wound site by gently scrubbing with warm soapy water and a
toothbrush to remove any dirt or debris, then I irrigate the wound site with
70% isopropyl alcohol to disinfect it. Next, I wrap a narrow perch with a piece
of pastic cut from a contractor’s garbage bag and tape it into place on the
perch. I then slather the top of the plastic-wrapped perch with your product
and place the bird on it. Every time the bird moves on the perch, it
self-medicates its feet. Over the course of the night, the bird may medicate
itself dozens of times as it changes position while sleeping–it’s that easy!
Since using this method and your product, I have not had a single
bird develop bumblefoot and all squirrel bites – even the particularly nasty
ones – have healed completely.
Sincerely,
Mike Bodary
Federally Licensed Master Falconer
“QuickDerm is a wonderful product and I was amazed with the
results. Max (our dog) also has diabeties, which makes the healing process
especially difficult. But after applying QuickDerm for one week directly to his
wound; well, the results speak for themselves! I love my dog and could not bare
to see him suffer and I am so thankful there is a product on the market that
yields such miraculous results.”
Warm regards,
Jeff McGahee
“I had tried two other products prior to using QuickDerm and they
were not giving me any results. I began using QuickDerm and noticed a change
within three days after the first application. There were six applications and
not much of the product was needed to cover the wound. The result of QuickDerm
speaks for itself. I will continue to use the product and recommend it to
others.”

Advanced wound care technologies treat chronic wounds
and these wounds often lead to infection and other complications, including
amputations, causing a significant burden to the healthcare system as demonstrated thru the below statistics:


Diabetic
ulcers: 800,000 estimated annual cases in the U.S. at a total national annual

Pressure
ulcers: annual treatment costs total approximately $1.3 billion in the U.S. 

Venous
stasis ulcers: treatment costs total between $2.5 - $3.5 billion in the U.S.
annually

6% of
hospitalizations that listed diabetes also listed lower extremity ulcer
conditions

Chronic
ulcers listed in 2.7% of hospitalizations listing diabetes

More than
half of U.S. amputations occur in diabetics

Foot
ulcers precede approximately 85% of lower extremity amputations in people with
diabetes

Up to 20%
experience additional amputation within 12 months (up to 51% in 5 years)

Five year
mortality following amputation 39%-68% in various studies

Diabetic Foot
Ulcers are estimated to affect approximately 25% of all diabetics in their
lifetime
Once the State of Illinois is rolled-out, we will begin rolling
out in other states.  The total project
cost is $450,000 in three phases.  We are
currently raising $150,000 for phase 1 and will extend our campaign fundraising
when phase 2 and 3 are beginning.  Below
is a description of each phase.

Phase
1


35 Patient IRB clinical study

Health economic study by well known health
economist in the State of Illinois evidencing the significant savings this
product would provide to the State via improved healing of ulcers
and reduction in amputations due to ulcers

Presentation of study to Illinois Medicaid
executives via lobbying group partners

Solidify preferred provider status

Negotiate preliminary pricing

Approval of Phase 2


Phase 2

Selection of up to 600 Illinois Medicaid
patients with diabetic foot ulcers.  Half
of the patients will be treated with this product and half (control group) will
be treated under the usual and customary treatment protocol.

Utilize Eocene health technology on the patients
treated with this product to monitor and ensure proper usage of the product.

Compile results on theses patients as further
evidence of  the product efficacy
displayed in the 35 patient study
Utilize the highly efficacious results to negotiate final
discretionary formulary pricing and preferred product provider status for ulcers

Phase
3


Installation of office for administrative and
clinical staffing

Determination and selection of appropriate
distribution channel

Installation of sales team to create pull-thru
for product thru distribution channel

Installation of clinical team to interact with
patients on product usage

<p>My name is Antonio, I´m 42 years old, I´m Italian and I live in Peru
since 2011. I´m Personal Trainer, Karate black belt and proven ability in
Martial Arts. All my life I played sports and I love cycling. </p>
<p>Arriving to Peru, I found that I could bike around and that was the only
way to know it more deeply, but most important is that the city of Lima, where
I live, physically and mentally struck me negatively. I felt weak and tired,
but out of town with my bike, every state of physical and mental discomfort
disappeared and my body felt boundless energy and enthusiasm. All this helped
me to understand how an artificial context as the city is, can be hardly
compatible with the expressions of body and mind, and yet, how a natural and
seemingly inhospitable context can recharge the person and their welfare to be
discovered itself with new potentialities. That´s why, I want to do this
cyclotrip- study, to monitor and document my body condition, mental and
psycho-emotional states of my body in localized in remote areas of the Peruvian
Andes.</p>
<p>This study will benefit all people interested in the research and
knowledge of welfare; as Wellness Coach, I have been working with my clients on
how to develop their bodies through the practice of movement, everything related
to coordination, balance and perception of the body, according to what the
person asks me.</p>
<p>My traveling companion is a Giant Mountaineer with Shimano XT / Deore,
wheels 27.5” and amortized fork Rockshock Gold 30 100 mm. Frame aluminum 6000
series, equipped with rear grill Topeck Super Tourist DX. For transportation of
luggage, I use two subsequent backpacks Ortlieb where I have clothing to combat
the cold, rain and wind, a small kitchen, first aid kit, tools and parts for
the bike.</p>
<p>In the backpack that I have put on the grill bike, I carry a tent, a
mattress, a sleeping bag and a ""Water Bag"" from 10 liters water
reserve. On the helm, I have an Ortlieb briefcase where I keep my documents,
phone and maps, plus cereal bars and fruit. On top of the lid of the briefcase,
I have a roadmap.</p>
<p>The trip consists of approximately 2500 kms, which I believe go in 50
days, with an average of 50 kms per day, depending on the difficulty of the
route. For food and lodging, I calculate US $ 20 per day, for a total of US $
1000 approximately. </p>
<p>I hope you can help me with this personal challenge!</p>

conocimientos demostrados en Artes Marciales. Toda mi vida he hecho deporte y
me apasiona el ciclismo. </p>
<p>Llegando al Perú descubrí
que podía recorrerlo en bicicleta y que era el único modo para conocerlo más
profundamente, pero lo más importante es que la ciudad de Lima, donde vivo, me
impactaba físicamente y mentalmente de manera negativa. Me sentía débil y
fatigado, pero al salir de la ciudad con mi bicicleta, todo estado de malestar
físico y mental desaparecía y sentía en mi organismo una energía y entusiasmo
desbordante. Todo eso me sirvió para entender cómo un contexto artificial como
lo es la ciudad, es poco compatible con las expresiones del cuerpo y de la
mente, y a la vez, cómo un contexto natural y aparentemente inhóspito pueda
recargar a la persona y su bienestar hasta descubrirse a sí misma con nuevas
potencialidades. Por eso,  deseo realizar

</div></div>","My name is Antonio, I´m 42 years old, I´m Italian and I live in Peru
since 2011. I´m Personal Trainer, Karate black belt and proven ability in
Martial Arts. All my life I played sports and I love cycling. 
Arriving to Peru, I found that I could bike around and that was the only
way to know it more deeply, but most important is that the city of Lima, where
I live, physically and mentally struck me negatively. I felt weak and tired,
but out of town with my bike, every state of physical and mental discomfort
disappeared and my body felt boundless energy and enthusiasm. All this helped
me to understand how an artificial context as the city is, can be hardly
compatible with the expressions of body and mind, and yet, how a natural and
seemingly inhospitable context can recharge the person and their welfare to be
discovered itself with new potentialities. That´s why, I want to do this
cyclotrip- study, to monitor and document my body condition, mental and
psycho-emotional states of my body in localized in remote areas of the Peruvian
Andes.
This study will benefit all people interested in the research and
knowledge of welfare; as Wellness Coach, I have been working with my clients on
how to develop their bodies through the practice of movement, everything related
to coordination, balance and perception of the body, according to what the
person asks me.
My traveling companion is a Giant Mountaineer with Shimano XT / Deore,
wheels 27.5” and amortized fork Rockshock Gold 30 100 mm. Frame aluminum 6000
series, equipped with rear grill Topeck Super Tourist DX. For transportation of
luggage, I use two subsequent backpacks Ortlieb where I have clothing to combat
the cold, rain and wind, a small kitchen, first aid kit, tools and parts for
the bike.
In the backpack that I have put on the grill bike, I carry a tent, a
mattress, a sleeping bag and a ""Water Bag"" from 10 liters water
reserve. On the helm, I have an Ortlieb briefcase where I keep my documents,
phone and maps, plus cereal bars and fruit. On top of the lid of the briefcase,
I have a roadmap.
The trip consists of approximately 2500 kms, which I believe go in 50
days, with an average of 50 kms per day, depending on the difficulty of the
route. For food and lodging, I calculate US $ 20 per day, for a total of US $
1000 approximately. 
I hope you can help me with this personal challenge!

Me llamo Antonio tengo
42 años, soy italiano y vivo en Perú desde el 2011. Soy Personal Trainer,
cinturón negro en Karate y  tengo
conocimientos demostrados en Artes Marciales. Toda mi vida he hecho deporte y
me apasiona el ciclismo. 
Llegando al Perú descubrí
que podía recorrerlo en bicicleta y que era el único modo para conocerlo más
profundamente, pero lo más importante es que la ciudad de Lima, donde vivo, me
impactaba físicamente y mentalmente de manera negativa. Me sentía débil y
fatigado, pero al salir de la ciudad con mi bicicleta, todo estado de malestar
físico y mental desaparecía y sentía en mi organismo una energía y entusiasmo
desbordante. Todo eso me sirvió para entender cómo un contexto artificial como
lo es la ciudad, es poco compatible con las expresiones del cuerpo y de la
mente, y a la vez, cómo un contexto natural y aparentemente inhóspito pueda
recargar a la persona y su bienestar hasta descubrirse a sí misma con nuevas
potencialidades. Por eso,  deseo realizar
este ciclo viaje- estudio para monitorear y documentar mi estado corporal,
mental y psico-emotivo localizado en las zonas remotas de los Andes del Perú. 
Este estudio beneficiará
a todas las personas interesadas en el conocimiento y búsqueda de su bienestar;
como Wellness Coach, vengo trabajando con mis clientes sobre cómo desarrollar
su cuerpo a través de la práctica del movimiento, todo lo referido a
coordinación, equilibrio y percepción del cuerpo, en función a lo que me pide
la persona. 
Mi compañera de viaje
es una Giant Montañera, con cambio Shimano XT/Deore, ruedas de 27.5"" y
horquilla amortizada Rockshock Gold 30 de 100 mm., Marco en aluminio serie
6000, equipada con parrilla posterior Topeck Super Tourist DX. Para el transporte
del equipaje, me sirvo de dos mochilas Ortlieb posteriores donde llevo ropa
para combatir el frío, lluvia y viento,  una
pequeña cocina, botiquín primeros auxilio, herramientas y repuestos para la
bicicleta. 
En la mochila que
tengo puesta sobre la parrilla de la bicicleta, llevo una carpa, una colchoneta,
una bolsa de dormir y una “Water Bag” de 10 litros para reserva de agua. Sobre
el timón, tengo un maletín Ortlieb donde guardo mis documentos, celular y
mapas, además de barras de cereal y fruta. Encima de la tapa del maletín, llevo
un mapa de ruta. 
El viaje consta de
2500 kms. aproximadamente, que calculo recorrer en 50 días, con un promedio de
50 kms. por día, dependiendo de la dificultad de la ruta. Para la alimentación
y hospedaje calculo US$ 20 diarios, que da un total aproximado de US$ 1000.

</h3>
<div>
<p>We have already had some media attention in Poland after the launch of our first service. Lots of good reviews. But sometimes feedback was very aggressive and scandalous. We had a lot of discussions in the local media about social responsibility of startups. <b>And we understood that tolerance was impossible without taboo breaking.</b></p>
<p>That's why we decided to start Indiegogo campaign. We want to break taboos and share our ideas with big hope for change. These are the main ideas we stand for:</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Tolerance</span><br/></b></li>

</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<p>The idea of JustSignThis came to Andriy Tkachiv, when he was thinking about a
birthday present for his friend. He found a young woman, who wanted to write
his birthday greetings on her body. Unfortunately, due to organisational problems, the
gift didn't arrive on time and was not of the highest quality. </p>
<p>That was the moment, when Tkachiv and his friend Maksym Volokhan made the decision to found JustSignThis <i>(first
name was SignMyTits). </i><span>They also create great system which gives an opportunity for beginner models to get first experience. This ensures high quality products and
fast delivery. </span></p>

Why Did We Come to Indiegogo? 


We have already had some media attention in Poland after the launch of our first service. Lots of good reviews. But sometimes feedback was very aggressive and scandalous. We had a lot of discussions in the local media about social responsibility of startups. And we understood that tolerance was impossible without taboo breaking.
That's why we decided to start Indiegogo campaign. We want to break taboos and share our ideas with big hope for change. These are the main ideas we stand for:



Tolerance
Beauty of Body
Freedom of expression
Naturalness




We believe that with your help we can share these ideas and make our little service be a symbol of any kind of tolerance, freedom of thought and expression. Support more open and tolerant world and see what we have prepared for you...


How Are We Planning to Reach Our Goals?You ask how we are planning to share our ideas and fight the taboos?

What Are We Planning to Do When We Reach our Goals? 
1) We want to make new services to break more taboos
You may think ""Oh, these guys are so fancy!""...BUT, surprise-surprise, our new service will be mostly devoted to the idea of breaking ""ideal body"" stereotype. We are going to promote ""non-standard beauty"" concept. For instance, service ""SignTheDadBod"" with ""Dad Bod"" man. Same kind of offer will also appear for girls. We want to give opportunities for models with non-standard forms to gain the experience and fight against stereotypes of 90x60x90.







""At first glance, our products might be seen as a break of taboos, but we believe
this is exactly what some parts of the world require to engage in an open debate
about equality."" - Andriy Tkachiv – CEO / Founder 






2) Add new exclusive products as perks




When we meet 5 000 $ we will add iPad & Tablet Cases


When we meet 10 000 $ we will add Hoody with personal message


When we meet 15 000 $ we will add special ""Inception edition"" of our T-Shirts...  You are looking forward for those, believe me ;)

More other products to come



3) Finance tolerance campaign in Poland and Russia







The tolerance campaign aims to raise awareness and cause open debate among Polish and Russians, about their homosexual countrymen. 










""We have a lot of homosexual friends here in Poland and also in Russia. And want to use our campaign, to
help them fight the taboo of their homosexuality."" - Maksym Volokhan – CMO / Founder 
4) Found our own clothing line

We will appreciate that!

Project History











The idea of JustSignThis came to Andriy Tkachiv, when he was thinking about a
birthday present for his friend. He found a young woman, who wanted to write
his birthday greetings on her body. Unfortunately, due to organisational problems, the
gift didn't arrive on time and was not of the highest quality. 
That was the moment, when Tkachiv and his friend Maksym Volokhan made the decision to found JustSignThis (first
name was SignMyTits). They also create great system which gives an opportunity for beginner models to get first experience. This ensures high quality products and
fast delivery.

According to the CDC in 2014, 29.1 million people in the United States have diabetes, around 9.3% of the population. Another 86 million people are in pre diabetes and each year there are 1.7 million new diagnoses of diabetes.</p><p>This means 1.7 million people, now have to make changes to how they eat and exercise, along with having to track their blood sugar. This is really important, in that low blood sugar, or hypoglycemia, can lead to a myriad of side effects, the worst being death. Essentially, when a diabetic becomes hypoglycemic, they may experience chills, clamminess, shakiness, seizures, and even become unresponsive. When unresponsive, a diabetic is helpless; if someone isn’t around to help them or administer medication/first aid, the likelihood of survival can become slim to none.</p><p>This is how the idea came to be, as one of the founder’s friends has had this happen multiple times.</p><p>They are still around today, but many diabetics do not get nearly as lucky. While deaths due to diabetes is a difficult stat to track, as it is usually attributed to organ failure or some other cause, the knowledge of the possibility is definitely known to the diabetic and the people close to them.</p><p>Parents wonder if their child is keeping track of their blood sugar as they should be, or if they are taking their medicine in a timely manner.</p><p>Others may have a diabetic parent living on their own and wish they could have a way to be kept in the loop on their glucose levels and vital stats.</p><p>Diabetics themselves may be worried that, the next time their blood sugar dips too low, they may not have someone nearby to alert their loved ones or emergency personnel of their crisis. So this is where the Brio Band comes in.</p><p>The <strong>Brio Band</strong> is designed to be a smart glucometer watch with a built in alarm for low blood sugar episodes. When paired with the companion app on your smart phone, the band is able to send an alert out to friends and family of a potential low blood sugar episode, while also producing a local noise alarm. These episodes are detected by either the built in glucometer or using a predictive sensor platform that tests for symptoms of low blood sugar.</p><p>It also includes features on the app and watch that can help manage a user’s weight, exercise, and food intake. It also includes a prescription reminder, health calculators, and other features. An additional optional casing around the watch includes a built in lancet system and strip storage creating an all-in-one kit that conveniently sits on your wrist.</p><p>If this device could help to save one life, then it would be considered an outright success.

According to the CDC in 2014, 29.1 million people in the United States have diabetes, around 9.3% of the population. Another 86 million people are in pre diabetes and each year there are 1.7 million new diagnoses of diabetes.This means 1.7 million people, now have to make changes to how they eat and exercise, along with having to track their blood sugar. This is really important, in that low blood sugar, or hypoglycemia, can lead to a myriad of side effects, the worst being death. Essentially, when a diabetic becomes hypoglycemic, they may experience chills, clamminess, shakiness, seizures, and even become unresponsive. When unresponsive, a diabetic is helpless; if someone isn’t around to help them or administer medication/first aid, the likelihood of survival can become slim to none.This is how the idea came to be, as one of the founder’s friends has had this happen multiple times.They are still around today, but many diabetics do not get nearly as lucky. While deaths due to diabetes is a difficult stat to track, as it is usually attributed to organ failure or some other cause, the knowledge of the possibility is definitely known to the diabetic and the people close to them.Parents wonder if their child is keeping track of their blood sugar as they should be, or if they are taking their medicine in a timely manner.Others may have a diabetic parent living on their own and wish they could have a way to be kept in the loop on their glucose levels and vital stats.Diabetics themselves may be worried that, the next time their blood sugar dips too low, they may not have someone nearby to alert their loved ones or emergency personnel of their crisis. So this is where the Brio Band comes in.The Brio Band is designed to be a smart glucometer watch with a built in alarm for low blood sugar episodes. When paired with the companion app on your smart phone, the band is able to send an alert out to friends and family of a potential low blood sugar episode, while also producing a local noise alarm. These episodes are detected by either the built in glucometer or using a predictive sensor platform that tests for symptoms of low blood sugar.It also includes features on the app and watch that can help manage a user’s weight, exercise, and food intake. It also includes a prescription reminder, health calculators, and other features. An additional optional casing around the watch includes a built in lancet system and strip storage creating an all-in-one kit that conveniently sits on your wrist.If this device could help to save one life, then it would be considered an outright success. But where we believe it will have the greatest impact is in providing peace of mind to diabetics and the people closest to them.Since we want to create a device for the people, we want feedback from you!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>YoconutDF Founder Bonnie Lau loves to eat! She is a foodie of all things delicious and dairy free, and is a runner, a dancer, a yogurt maker.  Bonnie realized the world needed a better yogurt when she was training for her first marathon – she wondered: what if the perfect yogurt can be made with plant-based ingredients?  </p>
<p>She teamed up with two food-loving scientists and together they invested more than 3 years reimagining the most delicious, velvety combination, to bring the magic of eating to a whole new level. In fact, Yoconut is uber delicious <u>and</u> healthy.  It has been nominated for the 2016 Veggie Award for “Best Vegan Yogurt.” </p>
<p>There is power promised in eating food that is good for you. It fuels your every cell, giving you the extra boost so you can create your best life.  Plus, the buzz of happiness is priceless. Enjoy the wonderful journey that good food can take you. Let Yoconut unleash your inner power to achieve life’s potential.</p>

</h4>
<p>I am passionate about getting
this product out there because I know what it’s done for me personally and I
want to share its benefits with others.  I
was in my fifties, out of shape, and diagnosed with Stage 4 osteoarthritis. So
there was no way I could work out to get myself back in great shape. I was
trapped.  There had to be a way out.</p>
<p>I decided to take a
whole picture approach, feeding my body with a range of nutrients including vitamins,
electrolytes (minerals and special salts), glucosamine, and certain herbal
extracts. But the most important thing I came across in my research was <b>cell function</b>. I discovered I needed to
rekindle a cell function process called <b>Mitochondrial Biogenesis.</b></p>
<p>When I did, everything changed for me. I went to my doctor for a physical
and got an A+. For the first time in 5 years my blood work came back completely
normal, I’d been borderline Type II diabetic but now showed a dead center normal result.
Astonishingly, I hardly even realize I have stage 4 osteoarthritis, which had
been so bad it made me limp. All my doctor could say was: “keep doing whatever
you’re doing! *”   </p>
<p>I’m more <b>energetic, stronger both physically and mentally</b>, and at the same time, I
feel <b>relaxed</b>. And my joints are pain-free!</p>
<p>After manufacturing a small batch of MITOflex and seeing other people start to experience
the same wonderful benefits, I realized I have to find a way to share this

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There is solid science behind the powerful combination of
ingredients in MITOflex. Each ingredient supports a part of the end goal -
strength, joint health, energy, positive attitude, and a sense of well being.
Together they help give you the foundation you need to perform at your best. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">With the right cell function support at a cellular level
everything starts working better. From the first few days of use you will
notice a difference. After about 3 weeks, cells start producing more energy, and you should expect to feel stronger both mentally and physically.</p>

<h4><br/></h4>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Basically, the mitochondria use the food and nutrients we eat
to produce energy. The mitochondria’s main role in the cell is to take
glucose and use the energy stored to make ATP in a process called cellular
respiration. This ATP is then released from the mitochondria, and broken down
by the other parts of the cell to power themselves. Muscles use ATP when they
contract, the more ATP the better.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">If you don’t eat the right stuff, the energy isn’t there. That’s
where MITOflex makes the difference, providing the cellular level strength you
need to be your youthful best. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">There are no peaks and valleys, like with energy shots. Just a
steady long-term feeling of alertness, energy and health. This is complemented
with deep and refreshing sleep. The effect is amazing -- I would almost call it
miraculous. And I’m an engineer! </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">I’ve spent nearly two years getting to this point. Doctors have
been consulted to make sure they approve of the use of this combination of
ingredients (they were highly encouraging that it was ""all good
stuff!""). The staff scientist at the FDA-regulated facility where MITOflex
is manufactured approved the formula. Everything we use is considered by the FDA to
be over-the-counter food or vitamins.  </p>

supporting with an order for MITOflex Energy Foundations today!






It's about the whole picture, not a single ingredient.



Lower cost & more convenient
There is solid science behind the powerful combination of
ingredients in MITOflex. Each ingredient supports a part of the end goal -
strength, joint health, energy, positive attitude, and a sense of well being.
Together they help give you the foundation you need to perform at your best. 
With the right cell function support at a cellular level
everything starts working better. From the first few days of use you will
notice a difference. After about 3 weeks, cells start producing more energy, and you should expect to feel stronger both mentally and physically.





Basically, the mitochondria use the food and nutrients we eat
to produce energy. The mitochondria’s main role in the cell is to take
glucose and use the energy stored to make ATP in a process called cellular
respiration. This ATP is then released from the mitochondria, and broken down
by the other parts of the cell to power themselves. Muscles use ATP when they
contract, the more ATP the better.
If you don’t eat the right stuff, the energy isn’t there. That’s
where MITOflex makes the difference, providing the cellular level strength you
need to be your youthful best. 
There are no peaks and valleys, like with energy shots. Just a
steady long-term feeling of alertness, energy and health. This is complemented
with deep and refreshing sleep. The effect is amazing -- I would almost call it
miraculous. And I’m an engineer! 
I’ve spent nearly two years getting to this point. Doctors have
been consulted to make sure they approve of the use of this combination of
ingredients (they were highly encouraging that it was ""all good
stuff!""). The staff scientist at the FDA-regulated facility where MITOflex
is manufactured approved the formula. Everything we use is considered by the FDA to
be over-the-counter food or vitamins.  


I have purchased a
production run of MITOflex and I'm making it available FIRST through this
Indiegogo campaign at a special introductory price.  




It's about the whole picture, not a single ingredient.




Be among the first to experience the beautiful benefits this
proven product, and help bring it to market just by ordering for yourself. 


  



We expect to start shipping on November 1st.
As with all
supplements you should show the supplement fact panel to your doctor and read the supplement facts sheet completely.  If you have known allergies the allergens are listed on the label.

                    After using MPBI for more than 8 weeks, things have completely changed.  
                    The little things don't bother me anymore.   I'm a lot more calm. Stress at work has disappeared, 
                    I can focus now really well.   I'm a lot more productive at work and at the gym.  On the courts - 
                    I can get there again.  I'm working out whenever I want now - I don't get sore two days later, recovery 
                    is like when I was in my early 20's, I'm actually in my 50's.  This stuff is like using high octane fuel 
                    instead of low grade.  I just feel and do better.",19.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</ul><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><ul>
<li>There is risk in any product development process.

<h3><u><strong>Update:</strong></u></h3>
<p>Great news!!! We've been able to cut out the middle man on part of the production.  So we've lowered the prices on the pillow.  Check out the new prices on the perks and as always, thanks for you support.</p>
<h3><u><strong>The back story:</strong></u></h3>
<p>My partner, Norm, and I developed this product, the Solace Edema Pillow, out of necessity.  Norm is a trained auto  mechanic and I have worked in healthcare finance for about 2 decades.  Our expertise here is from personal experience.</p>
<p>Norm developed health issues that caused chronic edema - swelling in his lower extremities.  He needed something to keep his feet elevated while resting.  Every night he was kicking the pillows off the bed and would wake up with the same swollen legs, ankles  and feet that he went to bed with.</p>
<p>Through trial and error, we came up with the Solace Edema Pillow.  This pillow stays on the bed, even if you toss and turn throughout the night.  If you have edema, you wake up with little or no swelling.  Because it worked so well for Norm, we decided that we should share our creation with the world.</p>
<p>Here's the great thing about this pillow - it has many other uses!  We realized that it can be used just for lounging or to reduce the effects of many common ailments such as post-surgery swelling, upper respiratory ailments, snoring and more!</p>
<h3><u><strong>Where we are now:</strong></u></h3>
<p>Norm and I have already got everything lined up! Specialty foam manufacturer; fabric supplier; sewing company; we even have a warehouse lined up. There's also a van that we can purchase to pick up our supplies.  As all of our suppliers are local to us, in New Jersey, this will help keep costs down. Best of all, we have multiple doctors asking us for marketing materials and when the Solace Edema Pillow is going to be on the market!</p>
<p>With your help we will get this company off the ground and make this patent pending product available to you and the world.  The funding will go towards acquiring the warehouse, the van, minimum orders from our suppliers, everything we need to set up the warehouse for production, and of course, initial inventory.</p>
<p>We've received some feedback from initial users.  Some have said that they would prefer a pillow that is a little lower than the 10"" pillow that they tried. So, we're going ahead and offering heights of both 8"" and 10"" right away.  We're offering the pillow to you, our early birds, at a 25% discount on your purchase.</p>
<p>Should we not reach our goal, we still plan to move forward with this endeavor.  We will have to make adjustments on our plan, such as sharing warehouse space or renting equipment, instead of purchasing, to reduce initial set up costs. Above all, we will make sure that we provide you with your pre-ordered Solace Edema Pillow and thank you gifts.</p>
<h3><u><strong>Impact on the world:</strong></u></h3>
<p>Norm and I can't emphasize how much the Solace Edema Pillow can help millions of people.  Many conditions cause edema either temporarily, such as pregnancy, or chronically, such as heart disease.  The Solace Edema Pillow can help alleviate multiple common ailment and conditions - none of which are limited to age, sex or race,  Anyone can benefit from the Solace Edema Pillow!</p>
<h3><u><strong>Risks and challenges we may face:</strong></u></h3>
<p>We certainly expect hiccups along the way, but we've spent 2 years working on this already and have resolved as many obstacles that we could think of along the way.  We do have lots of support - Norm's longtime friend and ""research assistant"", in addition to other friends who have started their own successful businesses.  These business friends have given us plenty of advice and guidance, and will continue to do so.</p>
<p>We've been developing great working relationships these passed two years - people in marketing, accounting, IT and more.  We've drawn upon their expertise and talents and gladly accepted their referrals to others who have assisted us.  We plan to continue this practice and pay it forward, if and when we can.</p>
<h3><u><strong>Other ways to help:</strong></u></h3>
<p>The Solace Edema Pillow is a product that millions of people will find very helpful for any number of ailments and conditions.  If you, yourself, do not need it, you probably know someone who does.  This product was born out of necessity, so let's get it to those who need it.  Please help us get the word out and remember to use the Indiegogo share tools! </p>
<p>Your donation, pre-order or referral is greatly appreciated.  We thank you in advance for your support and assistance, and millions of people around the world will greatly appreciate it when they can readily purchase the Solace Edema Pillow.</p>

<p><u><strong>A Vital New Resource</strong></u></p>
<p><i>Best Practices for Yoga with Veterans</i> is a vital new resource for yoga teachers, yoga service organizations, veterans and their families, veterans' organizations, VA administrators, and anyone interested in bringing yoga and mindfulness to veterans in a safe, effective, sustainable, and socially equitable way.</p>
<p>Our campaign aims to bring this resource to teachers passionate about sharing yoga and mindfulness with veterans or their families, and not knowing where to start or seeking more support and information.<strong>Your donation </strong>will make this possible. Not long ago, the very idea of “yoga for veterans” sounded odd to many. Today, yoga’s popularity among veterans and military personnel is growing fast. When adapted to meet the needs, concerns, and values of service members and their families, yoga offers vital tools for building health, strength, and resilience—physically, psychologically, and emotionally.</p>

<p>Imagine a world where mindfulness is taught from the ages of four to fourteen. That’s ten years of schooling dedicated to teaching our future generation how to breathe with intention, how to use all of our senses to appreciate life and how to cultivate a lasting relationship with our natural world. A place where emotions and feelings are valued, understood and talked about. Where people actively listen to one another instead of needing to get the next word in. A place where gratefulness, community, and celebration come before fear, anxiety and doubt. This is what you are creating through your donations. <strong>This is Camp Begin. </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What binds us together? </h3>
<p>Hi. My name is Moira and I am alive and breathing just like you. I am a teacher, wife, dog-mom, daughter, sister, niece, aunt, granddaughter and friend. I work hard, play hard and laugh a lot. I cry seldom, smile more, but never stop thinking. I think about what was, what could be and plan for what's next. I get in bad moods sometimes and lash out at people who don't deserve it. I have more anxiety than I let on and get stressed-out trying to balance my work life with my personal life. A struggle I face is being married to someone with chronic pain who can't always enjoy life the way I can. The most difficult thing I've had to deal with thus far has been my brother's loss to suicide. Life is hard. Unfortunately, I don't see that changing. And I am positive you would agree. Maybe you've suffered from divorce, loss, car accidents, bankruptcy, depression, or something else. Our stories are surely different and unique in their own way, but I see the obstacles we all face as the glue that binds us together. </p>
<p>What if you would have learned how to cope with life at a young age? Wouldn't that have been great? Most of the time I spent in school was focused on learning math, reading and science. But what I needed was guidance on how to deal. I needed a way to express myself. A place to be heard instead of being lost in a big class or in my family of eight. I needed to learn how to breathe and calm down instead of screaming at my parents, siblings and friends when I didn't get what I wanted. In high school I used to go outside to play basketball when I'd get upset. One day I came inside and my mom asked me, ""Moira, what's wrong?"" I snapped back sort of surprised, ""how did you know something is wrong?"" She kindly replied, ""Because you always go outside when you are upset."" Something clicked for me in that moment and now I often wonder what my life would have been like if I consciously understood the NEED I have to spend 30 minutes outside every day in nature. </p>
<p>By investing, you can help shape how our future generation reacts to life’s obstacles and setbacks. You can help build a community of people who know and value the importance of time spent in nature, play and self-expression. How we react is what shapes us and defines our very existence. Your gift will set the tone for a more compassionate and less reactionary world.    </p>

<h3>Trust that this journey led me to you</h3>
<p>Hi, again, I would like to re-introduce myself through the lens of my career path. My name is Moira Colleen Farrell, founder and owner of Hike and Heal Wellness's ""Camp Begin."" I am a kindergarten, first and second grade Physical Education teacher. The highlights of my day are playing with my dog, doing life with my wife and without question being inspired by my students. In addition to teaching general PE, I also teach a kindergarten self-regulation class centered in mindfulness. I am a member of their action research team and graduate of Breathe for Change, an organization that offers the only 200-hour Yoga certification in the world specifically geared towards building educator wellness. I have my bachelors degree in Physical Education with certifications in Adapted PE, Health Education, Ropes Course Facilitation, Sea Kayaking, and Yoga. Before working in public education, I worked at an experiential learning center for nearly a decade. I fell in love with the creation and facilitation of youth and adult leadership programs which had a profound influence in the creation of Camp Begin. Without these experiences, I wouldn’t be here connecting with you. Unfortunately accolades can't stand alone to create this camp that the Madison community and broader world needs. Only you can. Trust that the journey I've been on will take this camp you invest in beyond our expectations.  </p>

<h3>Help prevent our current societal problems</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Society fosters speed vs. awareness.</strong> Kids are growing up in a fast-paced, demanding world that stresses quick reaction versus critical thought. Have a question? Google it. Don't know how to spell that word? Autocorrect has it covered. Hungry? Let's go through the drive through. Bored? Watch a movie. We are constantly plugged in, thinking about who has liked our post, what comments we’ve missed, and more. Kids younger and younger are given cell phones from protective parents who need to ensure their child's safety while simultaneously meeting their child's social needs. In education, administrators want impactful staff development workshops in 30-60 minute chunks. Our society values speed and self-gratification high above the need to cultivate awareness for the present moment. Luckily, your donation to Camp Begin can help.</li>
<li>
<strong>We have unplugged from nature and play.</strong> Our plugged-in culture has created the largest disconnect to nature in history. The more technology we put ourselves in front of, the more green space we need. Our bodies crave the outdoors to recharge, slow down and breathe deeply. Current research suggests aspects of nature directly correlate to mental and emotional health. Author Richard Louv writes that kids growing up in urban neighborhoods may be suffering from Nature Deficit Disorder, the notion that spending less time outdoors results in a wide range of behavioral problems. Our need for nature is much like our need for unstructured play. In Madison, WI elementary schools, kids aging from 6-10 only get one recess per day unless their teacher blocks out extra time. This is a problem because as our brain develops, neural pathways are built through unstructured, creative play. Without it, we become socially inept, lack creativity and have poor problem solving skills.

<strong>Leadership is not ""core curriculum.""</strong> When I was teaching leadership development, it was absolutely clear that my job was needed and seen as important. Kids lacked conversation skills, faced self-esteem issues, didn't understand what it meant to hold others accountable often struggled showcasing personal responsibility. Now that I teach in public schools, I recognize that some teachers do take the time to teach leadership. But they aren't required to and it won’t become a common core class anytime soon. So if it isn't required in school, where will kids learn it? By donating, you will make leadership programming accessible for low-income families. Your scholarships will allow teachers to recommend students who don’t currently have the skills that need it. By donating today, you are creating awareness for the need to lead.</li>

<strong>Big numbers, low quality, average results.</strong> Popular summer camps are typically huge. They house a lot of campers, require a big staff and struggle producing quality results. Their instructors are high school or college students who can be minimally paid in exchange for summer housing. They teach more from trial and error versus experience. By donating to Camp Begin, you are investing in hard-working, certified educators who need a second job to stay afloat. In Wisconsin, teachers are underpaid and are full of anxiety. In Madison, 73% of teachers report that they face extreme levels of mental, emotional and physical stress every day. New teachers are quitting faster and seasoned educators are retiring early. Your donation will help teachers revive and practice their passion for nature, mindfulness, play and creative arts therapy. Your donation allows us to honor quality education by paying teachers a desirable wage.</li>

That’s ten years of schooling dedicated to teaching our future generation how to breathe with intention, how to use all of our senses to appreciate life and how to cultivate a lasting relationship with our natural world. A place where emotions and feelings are valued, understood and talked about. Where people actively listen to one another instead of needing to get the next word in. A place where gratefulness, community, and celebration come before fear, anxiety and doubt. This is what you are creating through your donations. This is Camp Begin. 
 
What binds us together? 
Hi. My name is Moira and I am alive and breathing just like you. I am a teacher, wife, dog-mom, daughter, sister, niece, aunt, granddaughter and friend. I work hard, play hard and laugh a lot. I cry seldom, smile more, but never stop thinking. I think about what was, what could be and plan for what's next. I get in bad moods sometimes and lash out at people who don't deserve it. I have more anxiety than I let on and get stressed-out trying to balance my work life with my personal life. A struggle I face is being married to someone with chronic pain who can't always enjoy life the way I can. The most difficult thing I've had to deal with thus far has been my brother's loss to suicide. Life is hard. Unfortunately, I don't see that changing. And I am positive you would agree. Maybe you've suffered from divorce, loss, car accidents, bankruptcy, depression, or something else. Our stories are surely different and unique in their own way, but I see the obstacles we all face as the glue that binds us together. 
What if you would have learned how to cope with life at a young age? Wouldn't that have been great? Most of the time I spent in school was focused on learning math, reading and science. But what I needed was guidance on how to deal. I needed a way to express myself. A place to be heard instead of being lost in a big class or in my family of eight. I needed to learn how to breathe and calm down instead of screaming at my parents, siblings and friends when I didn't get what I wanted. In high school I used to go outside to play basketball when I'd get upset. One day I came inside and my mom asked me, ""Moira, what's wrong?"" I snapped back sort of surprised, ""how did you know something is wrong?"" She kindly replied, ""Because you always go outside when you are upset."" Something clicked for me in that moment and now I often wonder what my life would have been like if I consciously understood the NEED I have to spend 30 minutes outside every day in nature. 
By investing, you can help shape how our future generation reacts to life’s obstacles and setbacks. You can help build a community of people who know and value the importance of time spent in nature, play and self-expression. How we react is what shapes us and defines our very existence. Your gift will set the tone for a more compassionate and less reactionary world.    

Trust that this journey led me to you
Hi, again, I would like to re-introduce myself through the lens of my career path. My name is Moira Colleen Farrell, founder and owner of Hike and Heal Wellness's ""Camp Begin."" I am a kindergarten, first and second grade Physical Education teacher. The highlights of my day are playing with my dog, doing life with my wife and without question being inspired by my students. In addition to teaching general PE, I also teach a kindergarten self-regulation class centered in mindfulness. I am a member of their action research team and graduate of Breathe for Change, an organization that offers the only 200-hour Yoga certification in the world specifically geared towards building educator wellness. I have my bachelors degree in Physical Education with certifications in Adapted PE, Health Education, Ropes Course Facilitation, Sea Kayaking, and Yoga. Before working in public education, I worked at an experiential learning center for nearly a decade. I fell in love with the creation and facilitation of youth and adult leadership programs which had a profound influence in the creation of Camp Begin. Without these experiences, I wouldn’t be here connecting with you. Unfortunately accolades can't stand alone to create this camp that the Madison community and broader world needs. Only you can. Trust that the journey I've been on will take this camp you invest in beyond our expectations.  

Help prevent our current societal problems


Society fosters speed vs. awareness. Kids are growing up in a fast-paced, demanding world that stresses quick reaction versus critical thought. Have a question? Google it. Don't know how to spell that word? Autocorrect has it covered. Hungry? Let's go through the drive through. Bored? Watch a movie. We are constantly plugged in, thinking about who has liked our post, what comments we’ve missed, and more. Kids younger and younger are given cell phones from protective parents who need to ensure their child's safety while simultaneously meeting their child's social needs. In education, administrators want impactful staff development workshops in 30-60 minute chunks. Our society values speed and self-gratification high above the need to cultivate awareness for the present moment. Luckily, your donation to Camp Begin can help.

We have unplugged from nature and play. Our plugged-in culture has created the largest disconnect to nature in history. The more technology we put ourselves in front of, the more green space we need. Our bodies crave the outdoors to recharge, slow down and breathe deeply. Current research suggests aspects of nature directly correlate to mental and emotional health. Author Richard Louv writes that kids growing up in urban neighborhoods may be suffering from Nature Deficit Disorder, the notion that spending less time outdoors results in a wide range of behavioral problems. Our need for nature is much like our need for unstructured play. In Madison, WI elementary schools, kids aging from 6-10 only get one recess per day unless their teacher blocks out extra time. This is a problem because as our brain develops, neural pathways are built through unstructured, creative play. Without it, we become socially inept, lack creativity and have poor problem solving skills. By donating, you can help people recognize our inherent need for nature and play for a more balanced, healthy life.

Leadership is not ""core curriculum."" When I was teaching leadership development, it was absolutely clear that my job was needed and seen as important. Kids lacked conversation skills, faced self-esteem issues, didn't understand what it meant to hold others accountable often struggled showcasing personal responsibility. Now that I teach in public schools, I recognize that some teachers do take the time to teach leadership. But they aren't required to and it won’t become a common core class anytime soon. So if it isn't required in school, where will kids learn it? By donating, you will make leadership programming accessible for low-income families.

More recently, the first immunological treatment for cancer was approved in 2010. The first cell-based immunotherapy was approved for treatment of prostate cancer and shortly after CAR therapy was announced. CAR therapy involves genetically modifying each patient’s t-cells to target tumor cells. By mid-2016, the FDA granted three more approvals. Since then, research has led to thousands of clinical trials worldwide. Many research oncologists believe that targeted t-cell therapy will lead to a cure for every type of cancer eventually.</p><h3>Thank you for your contribution.  Choose your perk now!</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493823040/rbofqqyqurslo0glcujl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p></div>","My name is John Livingstone and I am a cancer survivor. I am excited about new, but little-known advances in treating cancer with immunologic therapies.  Successful immunologic therapies cause our immune system to reprogram its cells so that they can then kill cancer cells. Please contribute to our project so we can create an easy-to-use database of success stories where patients benefitted from this therapy. Our goal is that cancer patients may learn more about these new medicines and research their own cure. Thank you.Founder’s Cancer Story and Vision:I have discovered even the best cancer doctors cannot know everything!In 2007, I noticed a rash on my skin. My family doctor expressed concern as the area had become quite alarming. He arranged a deep biopsy by a dermatologist. The diagnosis was a rare form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.  I was referred to an oncologist who said the prognosis was poor since there was no known cure.The lesson about research that I was about to learn has prompted me to form a team and create ImmunoDigest.com.I am fortunate to have good research skills, probably due to my career as a writer and publisher. I began researching my type of lymphoma and why it was so rare.Research led me to visit Cancer Treatment Centers of America in Tulsa. After extensive testing and consultation, they advised me they had no treatment for my cancer.  They suggested I contact University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. MD Anderson had the same horrible prognosis.I continued my research and found the proverbial “needle in a haystack” – a doctor at UCLA Medical Center who was studying my type of lymphoma. Her name is Dr. Lauren Pinter-Brown, a Clinical Professor of Medicine. I give thanks to Dr. Joseph Castrejon, my family doctor, and Dr. Pinter-Brown that I am here ten years later.It became clear to me that due to lack of information on the part of some oncologists, patients can die.

We also have an attorney and a CPA who will join this project to advise on the legal and financial aspects of our growth.Do you have any plans to add to the mission of ImmunoDigest.com?Yes, we have four future objectives:Provide specific information on clinical trials and the contact information for the right people to see if a patient might be considered for participation in a clinical trialProvide information on how to appeal adverse insurance company decisionsProvide sample letters that can be used for clinical trial applications and appealsCreate an international database of major hospitals and research institutions involved in curing cancer through immunology therapiesHow will future objectives be paid for?To accomplish these future objectives, we anticipate financial sponsorships by pharmaceutical companies, hospitals, and research institutions once ImmunoDigest.com is online and proving its value.  Depending on our success, we may conduct another Indiegogo campaign.Are there any existing resources that provide information about immunologic therapies?Yes, there are numerous sources of information about immunologic therapies, however, they are usually scholarly articles for medical professionals, not the patient.  Most sources use words like “synthesized IFN-gamma” and “Chemokines” and other terms unfamiliar to patients. No one is writing information that is patient-friendly which is the goal of ImmunoDigest.comWill non-traditional or non-western medical cancer therapies be included in ImmunoDigest.com?No. While there may be some treatments that people believe are effective, we will only include those therapies that are supported by the medical community as we understand it in the United States. We expect all treatments will have FDA approval in some form, or by FDA counterparts in other countries with similar standards of proving effectiveness.Will ImmunoDigest.com provide medical advice?Absolutely not!  ImmunoDigest.com is a digest, or collection, of existing medical information and published articles where doctors and patients have spoken of or written about Immunologic therapies.Are there any YouTube videos that explain the success of immunologic therapies?Yes, below are two of many videos.  Both men are of medical doctors speaking at TEDx Talks.  They have no affiliation with ImmunoDigest.com and are only included here as they have an easy-to-understand explanation of immunologic therapies and their videos are publicly available on YouTube.The first video is of Michael Jensen, MD, CAR T Cell Expert, Ben Towne Center for Childhood Cancer Research, Seattle Childrens Research Institute.  MD earned from the University of Pennsylvania.Dr. Jensen shares details on an FDA approved cancer treatment with a 91% cure rate for advanced relapsed leukemia.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kiDfLS0UXQ&t=44s The second video is of C. Jimmy Lin, MD, PhD, MHS, Cancer Genomics Pioneer who received his MD from The John Hopkins School of Medicine. Dr. Lin discusses immunotherapy and these types of cancer: colorectal cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, leukemia and brain cancer (glioblastoma) and the cures that have been seen. Dr. Lin describes the therapy as being like “cancer snipers” since a patient’s modified T-cells are so accurate at targeting specific cancer cells.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4tarl95XP1MWhat is the history of immunology?In summary, since 1796 when the first vaccine was created. More recently, the first immunological treatment for cancer was approved in 2010. The first cell-based immunotherapy was approved for treatment of prostate cancer and shortly after CAR therapy was announced. CAR therapy involves genetically modifying each patient’s t-cells to target tumor cells. By mid-2016, the FDA granted three more approvals. Since then, research has led to thousands of clinical trials worldwide. Many research oncologists believe that targeted t-cell therapy will lead to a cure for every type of cancer eventually.Thank you for your contribution.  Choose your perk now!",13.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Why?</h3>
<p><u><strong>We are aiming to help a million people get (and keep) a better back</strong></u></p>
<p>There's so much mediocrity and confusion in the world of Low Back Pain (LBP) treatment.  One thing's for certain - pills don't cure and neither does surgery (though admittedly it often helps in the short-term).  The only known, proven ""solutions"" to LBP are education and exercise.  But what should clinicians tell you, and which exercises should you do, when and how often?</p>
<p>Pain isn't just a physical thing - it's upsetting.  And that affects the people around you.  There are too many people affected to accept the status quo.  Postural supports can be helpful and have been hugely popular on crowdfunding sites, but it's kind of missing the point.  You've got muscles to hold you up - you shouldn't need external support.  Why do you?</p>
<p>Why a million?  I've helped tens of thousands all ready, and a million seemed like a good round number (and a great stretch-goal).  And hey, if we reach a million, I'm sure we'll reach many more beyond that first million.</p>
<h3>Who?</h3>
<p><strong><u>My name is Gavin Routledge</u></strong></p>
<p>I'm aiming to revolutionize the treatment and prevention of Low Back Pain.  I'm a Gold Medalist Osteopath and Vice Patron of the British School of Osteopathy, with 25 years clinical experience and a Masters Degree in the Clinical Management of Pain from the University of Edinburgh, co-author with Gavin Hastings OBE of The Back Book way back in 1997.  </p>
<p>I've always specialized in LBP and sciatica, partly because of my own experiences with these pains, and also because I find it deeply frustrating to hear of so many people suffering needlessly.  I'd like to help you and thousands of others to do what I've done myself, and what I've helped thousands of others to do.  As I say in the book, you only need three things to recover from LBP (and/or sciatica)</p>
<ol>
<li><i>understand why you get that pain</i></li>
<li><i>form a recovery plan tailored specifically to you</i></li>
<li><i>and stick to that plan. Forever.</i></li>
</ol>
<p><strong><i>""Over the years Gavin has enabled me to avoid surgery by encouraging me to identify the best ways to maintain my back, and recognise when I am stepping too close to the cliff."" </i></strong>Valerie Malcolm, 55, Property Manager</p>
<h3>How?</h3>
<p>I can't see each of the 1 million personally, but by creating the book and website I can provide the education and exercises (tailored to each sufferer's needs).  By supporting this campaign, you can make a lasting difference not just to your own back, but to the futures of thousands of others, maybe millions.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The book is all ready written and the website has been in Beta testing mode for the last month. The book I've been working on over the last 18 months. Your support will bring the book into print and support the improvement of the website (we're told it's pretty good all ready!).  I've been messing about with websites and content to support my patients for the last 5 years, learning what they use and how they use it, as well as what they don't like.  In 2014 I reviewed 232 apps on the app store for LBP - most were next to useless, some dangerous and none provided what the majority of sufferers need to know. </p>
<p>The book is a beautifully designed work-book, guiding you to understand the underlying risk factors for your particular back problem, what makes it worse and better and how to create your own program for long-term recovery.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1476366667/cqzyaksstr4eilppnz25.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The website is based on the knowledge in the book, but - as you'd expect - is interactive and mobile compliant, personalising the advice and exercises.</p>
<p>In order to run off the first 500 books, and pay our initial costs we need £10,000.  Every book bought beyond that helps to fund the further development of the website (as well as pay for the printing of the book you order). </p>
<p>If we were to fall short of the target, I will back the book myself, and you'll receive the copy you've paid for in your chosen perk.  However, I want to do this with a community who care about empowering themselves and others. Using Indiegogo to launch the book, website and campaign, I hope that we can grow more rapidly (with your help) and reach more people whose lives are blighted unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Backing the website alone is an option, and will ensure that it becomes the gold-standard in ""patient-centered"" digital health care.  The funds will go toward the development of habit-changing / coaching tools on the site, and the associated running costs of a data-intensive, interactive web platform.  We've all ready integrated the web app with Fitbit, so if you have a Fitibt, you can view your back stats alongside your activity stats - very useful!  If there are enough funds, the next stage of development will be a mobile app to accompany the site, but that may have to wait for another stage of the campaign - it's really up to you ;-)</p>
<p>If you get in early, you can back the book and/or the website at a reduced price.</p>
<p>You can also opt for the personal touch, connecting with me in a Skype consultation, and backing the book and the website all at the same time.</p>
<p>If you're responsible for the well-being of others, then there are the ""Big Backer"" options, where I'll come out to your office and deliver an engaging workshop focused on the avoidance of back pain as well as providing access to the website for 12 months for groups of users.</p>
<p>I know that if you support this campaign and share it with friends and family, we can smash this target and make big strides towards the million better backs goal!</p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal, your pledge will go towards the part you've chosen to support. If you back the book, you <strong>will</strong> receive a copy.  If you back the website you <strong>will</strong> gain access to it at the end of the campaign period.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Remember, LBP causes a huge amount of pain and suffering.  60% of LBP sufferers will have another episode within a year... We can save someone from going through that, or at least speed up their recovery and reduce the risk of it happening again.  </p>
<p>The goal to help a million people might seem like a huge stretch goal, but when you consider there are about a billion people with a sore back today, we're only talking one thousandth of that.  If you share the campaign with your friends and family, and everyone does that, we could - by the power of networks - easily reach that goal.  By sharing, you can help other people - and that feels good. Believe me - I help people every day, and it feels good. ;-)</p>
<p>I've never run a crowd-funding campaign before, but because LBP is so common it seemed like something a lot of people would care enough about to ""back"" and to share with others. Helping people is what I've done professionally for 25 years.  I'd just like to help a lot more than I have done so far (just over 21,000).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There aren't a lot of risks in backing this campaign.  The book is written and designed.  There's all ready a website - I just want to improve it, and that takes time and money.</p>
<p>We have worked with groups of LBP sufferers and <a href=""http://www.gsa.ac.uk/research/research-centres/institute-of-design-innovation/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Glasgow School of Art Design Innovation</a> team in shaping the web development and we plan to work with <a href=""http://www.designinformatics.org/team"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Edinburgh University School of Design Informatics</a> on the improvements to the website.  Improvements will take time, but we employ a ""SCRUM"" approach to software development and this has worked well to get us this far.  21 LBP/sciatica sufferers provided feedback on the content of the book at various stages through its 5 re-writes and many edits.</p>
<p>Managing your funds is pretty straight-forward; I've run a business for 23 years.  I look after people's health... I can certainly look after your money!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you just don't feel you can afford to help support the campaign financially, please share it with friends and family - maybe someone will buy the book for you!!  Remember how many people suffer from LBP and sciatica - please share and help them to get better.</p>

<p><strong>Smardii follows all guidelines published by the WHO, so that our product is safe for you and your loved ones!Smardii utilizes Bluetooth Low Energy 5.0., and it only turns on when needed.</strong></p>
<p><strong>BLE and health effects: </strong></p>
<p>A large number of studies have been performed over the last two decades:</p>
<ul>
<li>To date, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by radio-frequency electromagnetic fields use.</li>
<li>Tissue heating is the principal mechanism of interaction between radio-frequency energy and the human body. At the frequencies used by BLE, most of the energy is absorbed by the skin and other superficial tissues, resulting in no temperature rise in the organs of the body.</li>
<li>A number of studies have investigated the effects of radio-frequency fields on brain electrical activity, urine system, cognitive function, sleep, heart rate and blood pressure in volunteers. To date, research does not suggest any consistent evidence of adverse health effects from exposure to radio-frequency fields at levels below those that cause tissue heating. Further, research has not been able to provide support for a causal relationship between exposure to electromagnetic fields and self-reported symptoms, or “electromagnetic hypersensitivity”.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544495185/gznyrhalrcvovane6kq1.png"" src=""""/></p>
<ul>
<li>The <u>World Health Organization (WHO)</u> develops public information materials and promotes dialogue among scientists, governments, industry and the public to raise the level of understanding about potential adverse health risks of radio-frequency electromagnetic fields.</li>
<li>Two international bodies ( ICNIRP and IEEE ) have developed exposure guidelines for workers and for the general public. These guidelines are based on a detailed assessment of the available scientific evidence.</li>
</ul>
<p>WHO recommends to connected device users to respect the guidelines. In this way, BLE emissive power is far less than the maximum admitted.</p>
<ul><li>The most important is not the maximum emissive power on a short time but the long-term exposure, so the WHO recommends to limit exposure to electromagnetic fields (e.g. turn-off Bluetooth when not in use).</li></ul>

</div><div><p> </p></div></div>","MONITOR YOUR LOVED ONE’S HEALTH

The first-of-its-kind connected smart diaper for babies and brief for adults incontinent.
Safe, economical and easy to use, Smardii instantly detects wetness and soiling. It reads body temperature, location and positioning (prevention of SIDS and falls), and runs real-time urine analysis helping detect illnesses such as UTI.
Smardii’s innovative technology offers efficient monitoring and reassurance for parents and for caregivers whether in daycares, hospitals, or at home.

 
        

Smardii comprises three parts:​


The Sensor-built-in Diapers which are fully disposable for a quick and easy change. For users and caregivers, it looks and feels like a regular diaper. It’s just smarter… much smarter!
The external reusable and rechargeable disc called Smardii Puck which is the brain of our product. It easily clips onto the diaper, is very comfortable, and is connected to your phone via Bluetooth. It will provide timely alerts directly to your phone.
The Smardii Gateway, which is optional, will allow you to stay connected 24/7 with your loved one even while you are away.

NO MORE SNIFFING… NO MORE GUESSING...
2am… baby is crying… needs a change? Has fever? Are you sure? Who knows? Smardii does!
""Is my baby sleeping well through the night...?!"" ""Is she on her stomach..?!"" ""Is she on her back...?!""
""I left my baby with the 'sitter... is she ok..?!""
""I wonder if the nurses have checked on my mom at the nursing home..?!""


 
The Smardii App will alert you when there is a specific event, whether it is a wet or soiled diaper, an abnormal body temperature, a fall or spill, or even... first symptoms of potential illness!
                


A Diaper needs change: After unclipping the reusable Smardii Puck, simply take off the puck and trash the dirty diaper the old fashioned way. Then, use a fresh Smart Diaper and clip the Smardii Puck back on. It's that simple!

Baby or grandma' has temperature or has certain symptoms you should not ignore: at least you'll get an alert in real-time so that you can take care of your loved ones, and share this information with pediatrician or medical staff. Smardii will also be connected to medical appointment online scheduling apps so that you can easily make an appointment for your loved ones and be on top of their health.

Baby was ""shaken"" or Grandma' is trying to stand when she should not be: here again you'll get an alert immediately so that you can address the situation and possibly prevent serious injury or harm.


Data is transmitted via Bluetooth Low Energy to any smartphone, tablet, or computer.
The app enables 24/7 monitoring and automated time logs, which can be shared with healthcare professionals and family members.
Smardii’s location and body positioning capabilities are important safety breakthroughs in caring  for children or for dementia patients prone to wander or fall.

Helping with Potting Training: While in ""potty training mode"" Smardii will help you better monitor when your child usually goes, so that you can potty train your child and get him out of diapers quicker!
Location Services: Using the Smardii Puck and the Smardii Gateway, you'll be notified immediately when your child (or elderly parent) is out of range.
Preventive Health: Smardii is not only a convenience product. It is a truly smart system with the purpose of addressing certain medical conditions before they become more serious. 
SIDS Prevention: Smardii will help you monitoring that your baby is sleeping on his back, hence reducing risks of SIDS.

Alexa Enabled: Simply ask Alexa if it's time for a change, or when the diaper was last changed! You can reorder diapers simply by saying it or even make appointments with doctors or share medical information.

 


 

 



Smardii follows all guidelines published by the WHO, so that our product is safe for you and your loved ones!Smardii utilizes Bluetooth Low Energy 5.0., and it only turns on when needed.
BLE and health effects: 
A large number of studies have been performed over the last two decades:

To date, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by radio-frequency electromagnetic fields use.
Tissue heating is the principal mechanism of interaction between radio-frequency energy and the human body. At the frequencies used by BLE, most of the energy is absorbed by the skin and other superficial tissues, resulting in no temperature rise in the organs of the body.
A number of studies have investigated the effects of radio-frequency fields on brain electrical activity, urine system, cognitive function, sleep, heart rate and blood pressure in volunteers. To date, research does not suggest any consistent evidence of adverse health effects from exposure to radio-frequency fields at levels below those that cause tissue heating. Further, research has not been able to provide support for a causal relationship between exposure to electromagnetic fields and self-reported symptoms, or “electromagnetic hypersensitivity”.

Recommendation: 


The World Health Organization (WHO) develops public information materials and promotes dialogue among scientists, governments, industry and the public to raise the level of understanding about potential adverse health risks of radio-frequency electromagnetic fields.
Two international bodies ( ICNIRP and IEEE ) have developed exposure guidelines for workers and for the general public. These guidelines are based on a detailed assessment of the available scientific evidence.

WHO recommends to connected device users to respect the guidelines. In this way, BLE emissive power is far less than the maximum admitted.
The most important is not the maximum emissive power on a short time but the long-term exposure, so the WHO recommends to limit exposure to electromagnetic fields (e.g. turn-off Bluetooth when not in use).

<h3>Glove Four Features:</h3>
<p>-The Palm deflector pushes the ball away from the palm, forcing the player to control the ball with their finger pads</p>
<p>-The finger seperators keep your fingers in a wide athletic grip allowing you to cover more surface area of the basketball giving the player more control </p>
<p>-The adjustable weight is filled with iron steel and has the ability to come on or off the glove </p>
<p>-The exposed finger glove allows you to get the actual feel of the basketball while training</p>

<h3>Product Tested:</h3>
<p>This product was originally made at a small scale and tested by some of the best in each segment of the basketball market. The feedback we received was overwhelmingly positive. These segments include:</p>
<p>-WNBA Players</p>
<p>-NBA G-League Players</p>

<p><strong>Pitch </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The New Normal in Health and Fitness </p>
<p> </p>
<p>After this year, there is no telling where the fitness industry is headed. Gyms, fitness centers, and other facilities remain closed, and even as they reopen, it is likely that people’s habits will have shifted for good. We have seen over the last several months that North Americans are willing to look past traditional gyms and fitness centers: purchasing fitness equipment, weights, and cardio machines in large numbers, they are exhibiting a willingness to try new modes of exercise and cutting-edge approaches to their own health. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We see an opportunity to help people here, and we are eager to pursue it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Introducing: FitStop </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The app that we have designed, called FitStop, stands for a substantially different fitness environment – one that stands in stark contrast to the inconvenient gyms and fitness centers that have dominated the fitness sector for such a long time. On our app, personal trainers can launch their businesses from the comfort of their own homes, offering their services to wider audiences, who can also tap into them from the comfort of their own homes. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Our goal is to afford people complete and comprehensive access to their fitness journeys once again, something that may have slipped through their fingers and passed them by this year. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How It Works </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Getting started on FitStop is simple. As a personal trainer, you would create your profile and then set up your classes or connect with people for one-on-one training sessions. As a user, you would create your profile and then browse the classes that are available or find the personal trainer who is perfect for you. We have devoted ourselves to designing a platform that is easy to use, simplifying the process that people need to go through in order to start moving, get their bodies flowing, and claim all of their health goals. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Better Careers for Trainers </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>For a small fee, personal trainers can become their own bosses, launching their businesses online and cutting through all of the red tape that would otherwise seem so daunting to them as they worked to attract clients and set up online fitness classes. Everything goes through FitStop, from the video streams to the payments, which means that trainers can focus exclusively on offering top-quality personal training services. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Better Health for You </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>As a user on FitStop, you can access health, strength, and fitness from your phone, tablet, or even desktop computer. If you are looking for a personal trainer, for some motivation, or for a boost to your confidence, all you need to do is log in to the app, find your trainer or class, and take control of your health and wellness once and for all. Our interactive app is exactly what the moment calls for, filling a real need that North Americans in every city are experiencing. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you have searched for something new and different, this is it. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>FitStop is the key to your ultimate fitness success. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>A Fitter World for Us All </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition to supporting personal trainers and people who are looking for creative ways to exercise from their homes, both throughout the healthcare crisis and beyond, FitStop is doing important work toward building a better world for us all. We are making North America a healthier place to live, and at a time when potentially 30 million people are out of a gym space between Canada and the US, this is extremely important. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We have created all of the preliminary layouts and development plans for FitStop. To engineer the app itself, though, we need your support. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Right now, we are turning to you for help raising between $10,000 and $15,000. If we can hit $10,000, we will be able to cover most of our development costs, and if we can raise more than $15,000, we will divert the remainder to our advertising budget, promoting FitStop to people across the US and Canada. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>To say thanks to everyone who makes a contribution to this campaign, we are offering some limited-edition rewards, including discounts on group classes and merchandise branded with the FitStop logo. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Contribute now and do your part to get FitStop up and running! </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Our Business Model </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>To promote FitStop, we are going to form a community of fitness influencers and enthusiasts, leveraging existing audiences to encourage people to rethink their fitness strategies. We will then generate revenue through FitStop by charging small fees for the services that we are facilitating, empowering personal trainers by allowing them to keep the bulk of their charges – while making our model sustainable by making it economically feasible. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although there are other fitness apps on the market, FitStop is unique in that it is enabling personal trainers and their potential clients to connect directly, either one-on-one or in group classes. We are confident that once people understand the FitStop difference, they will download our app in large numbers. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Until then, we are concentrating all of our energy on development, doing everything that we can to avoid logistical difficulties and sticking to our timeline, leading up to our planned {month and year} launch. If we do run into any delays, we will be sure to keep all of our contributors in the loop, remaining transparent about all the progress that we are making. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition to making a monetary contribution to this campaign, you can show your support for FitStop by sharing a link to the campaign on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and any other social media platforms you use. The more people are aware of what we are doing, the smoother this launch will go. If you know anyone who feels as if they have fallen off their fitness path because of isolation or gym closures, let them know that there is another way. Let them know that FitStop has arrived. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>We appreciate all your support, both monetary and non-monetary, and we thank you for taking the time to read about what we are doing. </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My name is Sebastián, I am the co-founder of <a href=""https://www.egalhealth.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Egal Health</a>.</p>
<p>Egal Health offers a modern approach to equality through an online platform designed to provide easy access to mental healthcare and wellness for people in the LGBTIQ+ spectrum.  We match LGBTIQ+ patients with licensed, trained, and accredited psychologists and provide counseling privately or anonymously via video or audio. Our mission is to provide everyone with easy, affordable, and secure access to professional counseling on-demand.</p>
<p>To learn more about our team you can visit our profile at <a href=""https://theorg.com/org/egal"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Org</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Size of the Problem</strong></p>
<p>According to data from the Australian Government, 41% of LGBTIQ+ people have a diagnosed mental health condition. However, many of us avoid mental healthcare due to fear of stigma, high price per session, or geographic distances. These all serve as barriers for individuals who would otherwise benefit from counseling.</p>
<p><strong>The Solution</strong></p>
<p>Recent studies have shown that <a href=""https://mhealth.jmir.org/2019/1/e10948/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">94% of people</a> prefer digital psychotherapy over face-to-face therapy. In fact, <a href=""https://mhealth.jmir.org/2019/1/e10948/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">98% of people</a> using this method reported making progress. At Egal Health, our mission is to provide everyone with on-demand professional counseling that is easy, affordable, and secure. We are committed to building a diverse community that helps people feel supported in their healthcare journey, ensures that quality, readily available, and accessible mental healthcare is guaranteed at all times.</p>
<p><strong>We Need Your Support</strong></p>
<p>We are currently a team of five looking to build our first tech venture. We are experts in the areas of LGBTIQ+ psychology and neuroscience, business development, software engineering, and brand development. However, building a technology company is extremely expensive.

<p><strong>My Story</strong></p>
<p>At the age of 17 I came out of the closet. Ten years later I was diagnosed with anxiety. The first time I heard about it, I felt scared, vulnerable, and ashamed. Many things were going on in my life, and it was a key moment for me to better understand the sources of my symptoms of worry, restlessness, and trouble with concentration. All of these being ongoing issues I have dealt with since I was kid.</p>
<p>Whilst living in New York City I met with various psychologists who were specialized in LGBTIQ+ related issues. However, I found that many of them had no experience with the issues I was facing. Instead, I often felt judged for what was happening in my life and as if I was the one teaching them about my problems. To make matters worse, I was also paying a substantive amount for these services.</p>
<p>That’s how I arrived at the NY LGBT Center, a historic community centre located in Downtown Manhattan, where they referred me to a trained and specialized psychologist on gender and sexuality issues. My psychologist, Jeff, helped me to better understand that being gay has not been easy for me. Throughout my life, I have been bullied and discriminated against, being authentic at work has been a challenge, relationships have not been easy, and that is only the beginning of the list.</p>
<p>After numerous sessions with Jeff that involved delving into my upbringing and experience as an LGBTIQ+ person, as well as reading endless resources about sexuality and mental healthcare, I realized that finding professional help for my own mental health problem was the right solution. However, I also realized that issues such as availability, coverage, and quality meant that this solution was not attainable for everyone.</p>

</ul> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Here's detail:</p> <ul> <li>We need about $10 per Fun Kit, for the cost of fabric and a couple of art supplies.</li> <li>You can get your name on one of the tags we make for inside the pillowcase! Just make a donation of at least $25 and we can send you a picture of the tag.</li>
<li>We are also held a rummage sale, bake sale and giant board games to raise money. In the summer we plan to do a garage sale.</li> <li>If we don't reach our goal of being able to make 50 more of these, we will use the money to make as many of them as we can. And then we'll try some more!</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Kids will know you care</h3> <p>Everyone loves to get presents. We will do the work of getting it all together, but do need more money. Art supplies are super expensive. With all of our allowances we only got enough money for the first ten.</p> <ul> <li>Because we know something about being in the hospital, we want to do this for other kids. No matter how sick a kid feels, we still want to play and pretend, even if we can only do it from a bed.</li> <li>The pillowcases are made of new fabric, but we make each one ourselves.</li> <li>We have communicated with our local Children's Hospital to make sure our donations will be accepted. They will and they're very excited it won't just be for little kids.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> We can't just collect old art supplies from schools or people.</p> <ul> <li>We know that all art supplies must be new and unopened or else the Children's Hospital cannot distribute them.</li> <li>Being germ free means our items must meet the standards set by Child Life at our hospital. We are doing those things.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Even if you can't give us money, we could use your help.</p> <ul> <li>If you can't give, could you share our page with others who might be able to? We appreciate it very much.</li> <li>The share tools on here are easy to use!</li> </ul> </div> <p>You are awesome for reading this.

We want to add art supplies to them and we are calling them Fun Kits. Our motto is ""Play Down for Lay Down""!
   What We Need & What You Get Here's detail:  We need about $10 per Fun Kit, for the cost of fabric and a couple of art supplies. You can get your name on one of the tags we make for inside the pillowcase! Just make a donation of at least $25 and we can send you a picture of the tag.
We are also held a rummage sale, bake sale and giant board games to raise money. In the summer we plan to do a garage sale. If we don't reach our goal of being able to make 50 more of these, we will use the money to make as many of them as we can. And then we'll try some more!    Kids will know you care Everyone loves to get presents. We will do the work of getting it all together, but do need more money. Art supplies are super expensive. With all of our allowances we only got enough money for the first ten.  Because we know something about being in the hospital, we want to do this for other kids. No matter how sick a kid feels, we still want to play and pretend, even if we can only do it from a bed. The pillowcases are made of new fabric, but we make each one ourselves. We have communicated with our local Children's Hospital to make sure our donations will be accepted. They will and they're very excited it won't just be for little kids.    Risks & Challenges  We can't just collect old art supplies from schools or people.  We know that all art supplies must be new and unopened or else the Children's Hospital cannot distribute them. Being germ free means our items must meet the standards set by Child Life at our hospital. We are doing those things.    Other Ways You Can Help Even if you can't give us money, we could use your help.  If you can't give, could you share our page with others who might be able to? We appreciate it very much. The share tools on here are easy to use!   You are awesome for reading this. We hope you can help us .",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</h3>
<p>These are simple protein/nutrition bars that I have made. It is made from the basis of organic nuts and other organic and natural foods and has no preservatives, no processed foods, and no added sugars. It is packed with about 30 grams of protein and high in energy producing nutrients. It is also vegan approved, and most important very TASTY!
</p>
<h3>The Story<br/>
</h3>
<p>The idea came as I was just looking for something healthy to eat as a snack, and I mixed in a few items and decided to shape it into a bar. My college roommates (Chef Awesome &amp; Ali ""The Great"") tasted them and said I should sell it and...KA-POW! <br/></p>
<p>So far, I have been selling my product by hand and by person to person. I have seen nothing but positive feedback in that it tastes just right (not too sweet/unsweet but smooth), and that it is filling and healthy and that it GETS THE JOB DONE!</p>

<br/>
<h3>The Future<br/>
</h3>
<p>I would really like to put this item into local stores and get it to health/non-health conscious people (and those who just like good snacks). In order to do that I will have to produce this in larger bulk and in a commercial kitchen (in which I will also get Health Permits and USDA Organic Approvals, etc).</p>

</h3> <p>We can make these products

<p>I believe that we all can accomplish our dreams and in turn inspire others to do the same thing if we never quit or give up. You have a dream in you that will touch others.
