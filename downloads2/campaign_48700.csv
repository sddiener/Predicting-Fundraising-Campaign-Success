<p>Meet <strong>ZED</strong> - a battle hardened seraphim warrior. Banished from the holy land, ZED vies for his salvation the only way that’s left; by competing in the <strong>Tournament of the Accord</strong>. Possessing the corpses of fallen kin, he must survive the brutal gauntlet, and work his way through progressively challenging and terrifying realms. Only by collecting the souls of the damned can he earn his way back into the Gods good graces. <strong>ZED</strong>’s only chance at redemption is to defeat the soldiers of Legion, but he is not left to his own devices.

<p><strong>ZED</strong> takes elements from many styles of gameplay and melds them into a one of kind experience. At first glance, <strong>ZED</strong> is a top down throwback arcade shooter in the same vein as Robotron 2048 and SmashTV - albeit brought into the 21st century.

<p><span><em>(Preview of the Specials you can purchase in the Armory)</em><br/><br/>Unlike traditional top-down arcade shooters, <strong>ZED</strong> features a large arsenal of weapons you can equip and modify before you enter the arena. <strong>ZED</strong> can carry up to 4 into battle, and they can easily be quick-swapped when you find yourself in trouble.

<p>There are over <strong>30</strong> weapons currently implemented, including railguns, axes, flamethrowers, smg’s, assault rifles, and tons more to keep you armed to the teeth!  Each weapon features its own stats, including fire-rate, critical hit chance, damage per-second, and accuracy - all of which can be improved with leveling and upgrade selection.

<h3>
<br/>Occulus Rift Support!</h3>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>A lot of people are excited, while a lot of others are confused as to how we plan on implementing the Oculus rift into our game experience. Since we don’t have one yet, and haven’t been able to definitively measure the pros and cons of different implementations, the general idea is that you will have control of what you, and ZED, are looking at. We are both very excited about the Oculus rift so I guarantee it will be getting a good amount of attention on this end.</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>That's great! Who are you?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We have 20 years combined experience in Design &amp; Production of games, web, mobile, and video. That said, there are only 2 of us. It has been a labor of love for gaming and great game experiences, and hopefully one you will be able to share with us. Because there are only two of us, you probably already know the answer to the question below: </p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Why are you fundraising?</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span>To be honest, <strong>ZED</strong> will be released no matter what. We have dedicated countless hours and nights to developing this game, so come hell or high water, this game will be completed. That said, this funding will make that happen in a timely manner, and get additional features that we simply can’t tackle without more resources. </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We launched <strong>ZED</strong> on Steam Greenlight October 2012 and found that there was an overall love for the style of game we are trying to build. We have been taking everything the community has had to say about it and are constantly making it better. We're hoping to find the support and community involvement to make this project a success, not only in our eyes, but to you the end user. So what will the funding go towards? We want to be 100% transparent with what these funds will be used for. There are a few things that we must cover in some way, so these items will take priority:</p>
<p></p>
<p> </p>
<p>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><em>Rewards for backers</em></li>
<li><em>Software licensing costs</em></li>
<li><em>Server costs for multiplayer and player management</em></li>
<li><em>Once these costs are covered, we will be using our successful funding for the following:</em></li>
<li><em>SFX and soundtrack development</em></li>
<li><em>3D modeling and animation support</em></li>
<li><em>Additional programming &amp; server support</em></li>
<li><em>Platform licensing costs</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>We have been thinking about Stretch Goals as well. We have a rough outline of things we would like to implement into the game. We are basing what comes first on campaign funding and community voting. These are subject to change.</p>
<p><em><em> </em></em></p>
<p><em><em><img alt=""goals"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/472/084/757a92bcb1c6a8290d187c47f7a59931_large.jpg?1364339803"" src="""" style=""""/></em></em></p>

<p>That's all for now folks!, Thank you for your support!<br/> </p>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>We've tried to do as much as we can to show the community how dedicated we are at what we do. We both love making games and aside from the possibility of not fulfilling our Indie Gogo Campaign, we would still find some way of finishing it on our own.</p>
<p>Working with contractors can sometimes be difficult with Time Zones and project management. Luckily we have both experience in studio environments as well as working from home, learning some of the best tricks to successful projects, like running daily scrum.</p>
<p>If we don't make our goal we are set to fixed funding. Which means if we don't raise our entire goal all the funds will be refunded to the backers registered on I/G.</p>

The Story (So Far...)
Meet ZED - a battle hardened seraphim warrior. Banished from the holy land, ZED vies for his salvation the only way that’s left; by competing in the Tournament of the Accord. Possessing the corpses of fallen kin, he must survive the brutal gauntlet, and work his way through progressively challenging and terrifying realms. Only by collecting the souls of the damned can he earn his way back into the Gods good graces. ZED’s only chance at redemption is to defeat the soldiers of Legion, but he is not left to his own devices. Build a massive arsenal, wield unique powers, and give special blessings to ZED’s armor in order to help him reclaim absolution.





Sounds great! What's next?
ZED takes elements from many styles of gameplay and melds them into a one of kind experience. At first glance, ZED is a top down throwback arcade shooter in the same vein as Robotron 2048 and SmashTV - albeit brought into the 21st century. But ZED has many layers beyond classics such as these, and brings many elements of gameplay you find in RPG, ISO, and FPS games. A few noticeable features of ZED include:

Multi-Platform Support 
Multiple Breathtaking 3D environments to battle Legion through
Full multiplayer support 
A massive arsenal of equippable weapons and upgrades 
Multiple unique special powers and armor blessings 
Balanced Difficulties for new to experienced players
A full leveling system for players and weapons 
Oculus Rift Support (OMG HOW)

SFX and soundtrack development
3D modeling and animation support
Additional programming & server support
Platform licensing costs



 
We have been thinking about Stretch Goals as well. We have a rough outline of things we would like to implement into the game. We are basing what comes first on campaign funding and community voting. These are subject to change.
 

 
What do I get out of this?
Not only will you get an amazing gaming experience, we are offering the following rewards:BETA ACCESS (Digital Item)To show our support we are offering any backer who pledges 15$ or above a limited Beta Access key that will come available on Desura. This is different from our global multiplayer.

Can we help other ways?
The next best way to help ZED which is just as helpful as monetary backing is social sharing. Please follow us on Twitter and Like us on Facebook if you use any of these social platforms and pass them along to friends or family :)
We could use your Vote! If you are a Steam user please take a moment and check out our official Steam Greenlight page.
That's all for now folks!, Thank you for your support! 
Risks and Challenges
We've tried to do as much as we can to show the community how dedicated we are at what we do. We both love making games and aside from the possibility of not fulfilling our Indie Gogo Campaign, we would still find some way of finishing it on our own.
Working with contractors can sometimes be difficult with Time Zones and project management. Luckily we have both experience in studio environments as well as working from home, learning some of the best tricks to successful projects, like running daily scrum.
If we don't make our goal we are set to fixed funding. Which means if we don't raise our entire goal all the funds will be refunded to the backers registered on I/G.",31.0,0,"2 Campaigns

What would you say if our diaper bag


Could
  help you become a better parent?


Create more positive experiences with your children?


Help you make diaper changes easier?


Help organize children supplies for you?


Allow you to continue using it for your daily tasks even after the kids have outgrown the diaper bag stage?


 Latest version of Marlin - 3rd prototype (above)


 - As Featured In - 

Why Marlin?
We all know that parenthood can be
  challenging and we are not talking about the bees and flowers
  yet.

So we set out to design a diaper bag
that is better than anything else available.
Here are six reasons we think our diaper bag would really help make parenthood
easier; especially for fathers!
 
1. Diaper
change process
Handling  poop-filled diapers & a screaming baby isn’t a cup of tea. 
We  have streamlined the diaper change process into the bag design, making it a  quick and seamless process.
No  more digging inside diaper bags, no more fumbling with wet wipes, nappy creams,  diapers and poop!  
Get  the job done within a minute!


EZ-Diaper mat - just pull to use & splash resistant! (above)
 


Front diaper pocket for quick access (above)
 
 

EZ-Access pockets for wet wipes & rash cream (above)



 
 
 
2. Know
where everything is
No idea where  mummy packed their favourite toys and the kids are screaming their heads off?
Everything you need has their specific compartments  and organizers in our diaper bag,
 this means you know where they are, every time! 


Wide mouth opening & organizer packs (above)





 
 
 
3. Kids
outgrow, Marlin doesn’t
Your kids have finally moved out of
pre-school stage and the typical diaper bag goes into storage.
 Marlin doesn’t just make
parenthood easier; it makes your work + play easier too!

4. Convenience
+ Speed
Every  possible scenario during your parenthood has been thought through in the design  process of our diaper bag - Marlin .
 Everything  you’ll ever need from a first aid kit, 
 toys to coins for ice  cream can be easily accessed.
   


Better be safe than sorry. Keep a first aid kit handy! (above)


Keep snacks cool with Marlin's thermal pack (above)


""Handy Pouch"" for convenience stuff like coins, keys, cards (above)


No more misplaced keys (above)

Dual-Bungee wide mouth side pockets


EZ- pouch for ""peace-keeping supplies"" i.e. crayons, toys (above)

 
 
 
5. Trendy & Unisex Design
Crafted with high strength fabrics combined with pebble-grained leather trimming 
means looking sleek and composed,
  even with screaming children!
Convert Marlin into a messenger bag,
  backpack and a carry all in a heartbeat. 


 

Look good for work & no one would even notice Marlin is a diaper bag.

 
 
6. Built
  Tough + Comfort
We designed Marlin from materials often
  found in military equipment:

Water resistant zippers
Durable metal hardware
Pebble grained leather trimmings.
Air meshed & cell foam shoulder pads
Soft cotton wide detachable sling strap.
Reinforced sewing at high stress points.
Splash resistant & “Ripstop” honeycomb  nylon 
Smooth shoulder pads with no hard attachments

Smooth shoulder straps for kiddo's comfort during carrying (above)

</h3> <p style=""text-align: center;"">Hello! My name is Alexander and I work as a sales representative. My job is to represent the firm as well as myself in the best possible way and create lasting connections. I've found that the best way to do this is by being unique and that's why me and my friend Spiros decided to create Special Business Cards.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Forget the boring simplicity of the paper business card. When you meet someone for the first time you want to ""sell"" your personality in the best possible way.  Special Business Cards will provide you ""finesse"", except from the gently surprise you'll give to someone, we also think those cards are nice conversation starters! So... What we actually have in mind is to give to a simple business card some ""class"" and some other uses: </p>
<ol>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">Giving an idea of your uniqueness and originality</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">Conversation starter</li>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">Giving Information</li>

About us
 Hello! My name is Alexander and I work as a sales representative. My job is to represent the firm as well as myself in the best possible way and create lasting connections. I've found that the best way to do this is by being unique and that's why me and my friend Spiros decided to create Special Business Cards.
Forget the boring simplicity of the paper business card. When you meet someone for the first time you want to ""sell"" your personality in the best possible way.  Special Business Cards will provide you ""finesse"", except from the gently surprise you'll give to someone, we also think those cards are nice conversation starters! So... What we actually have in mind is to give to a simple business card some ""class"" and some other uses: 

Giving an idea of your uniqueness and originality
Conversation starter
Giving Information



Our idea was to design an uncommon business card that will excite anyone. For this, we chose to use 3 gentle kinds of wood and also Dark Plexiglass!  


Alder Wood


Oak Wood

Teak Wood

Dark Plexiglass   
What We Need & What You Get
 So, to make our vision become a reallity we need 
10.000$
With this contribution we plan to:  Get a supply of the finest quallity alder,oak and teak wood. Get a supply of the best quallity Plexiglass. Buy all the necessary equipment for the job : Laser engraving machine, press machine for the wood, necessary software.


We offer many perks in which you get to choose:



The kind of wood you would like to get, or the plexiglass.

One of our three graphic designs.
The ammount of the cards you want.
The ""extra"" packages we offer.
A ""Thank you for your support"" card.
A place for your name on our website on ""Our Supporters"" section.







Here you can see our 3 designs




Professional...





Looking very impressive...








Around 1,5mm thick / 3mm for Plexiglass

Risks & Challenges
We allready established relationships with our suppliers, they are ""ready to roll"" when we'll be. Of course that doesn't mean that everything should or definitely will run like a clock, some challenges could arise, but we will try to do our best to solve upcoming problems and stay on track with our timeline!

Meet the Geco Mark II. The world's first action camera that can be mounted onto any pair of glasses.
 *patent pending






GECO IN THE PRESS







WHAT IS THE GECO?


The Geco Mark II is the world's smallest HD action cam that can be mounted to any pair of glasses for a first person point of view.   Weighing in at just below 18 grams, it will be the smallest action camera in the world and with the price point that we are striving toward, the most affordable.
It's simple, hands-free and records in 720p!
 

HOW GECO WILL CHANGE THE MARKETPLACE
Putting the Geco into production will set the benchmark for micro action cams and will be a new form factor in the action cam industry, allowing for a unique viewing angle that captures the moment as if it was through the eyes of the person filming it.
 

HOW IT ALL BEGAN
We self-funded this project from the beginning, developing numerous prototypes, conducting tests and analyzing feedback for the past year. Through this, we developed key relationships with electronic component suppliers all around the world to source the highest quality components. We developed the Geco concept in-house by using 3D printers and 3rd party components. Crowdfunding will enable us to make our product more affordable- bringing the retail price down to $120- making it one of the most affordable action cams on the market.
 

WHAT YOU GET 
With each Geco Mark II you will receive:

A Standard Mini USB Cable
Various High Tensile Strength Elastic Mounts for Different Size Glasses
A Waterproof Case (including a universal Tripod Screw and our specialized mounting solution for Underwater Goggles.)
Velcro Mounting Strips for Flexible Mounting Options
A Pivoting Action Mount with Double Sided Tape






We currently use a 3D printer for the shells of our prototypes and 3rd party components for the electronics, but this method is proving to be expensive and time consuming. The Indiegogo pledges will be used to manufacture the Geco on a mass scale allowing us to keep the price low while still maintaining a high quality product.

 



THE DREAM WE HAVE

Our goal is to create an action cam that can be used by everyday people :

The Lifeblogger
The Student
The Youtuber
The Chef etc.

Our dream is to make the Geco as powerful as possible while still keeping it affordable, and with your help we can make this dream a reality.
The idea was to create an action cam that you can use hands-free but once we started testing the product, the outcome became much more profound. The footage not only lets you re-live the experience but also capture the emotion of the moment allowing the viewer to enjoy the moment as if they were there.

We used a single tactile push-in button that  powers up the camera and starts recording simultaneously. This button mechanism allows the user to distinguish between whether the camera is recording or not without needing visual confirmation.
Step 1: Press Button to start recording

Step 2: Record footage

Step 3: Press button to stop recording

 
 



FITS ANY PAIR OF GLASSES

 Over the last year, we developed many different mounting options including clamps, clips and glues, but they were all limited to the size of glasses to which they could be attached to. We stumbled upon the concept of using elastics while watching kids play with Lego. The elastics were lightweight and could stretch to amazing lengths without snapping or being distorted and could still keep a firm grip on an object.

 


WHAT STAGE ARE WE AT?

We started with reverse engineering old cellphone cameras and micro security cams and created our 1st working model out of wood. 
The initial design derived from reverse engineering an 808 cam
Final prototype
We developed the shaped body after investing in a 3D printer and created our 1st actual Geco. We have already made integral connections with the best suppliers in the world, who are ready to start production as soon as our goal is reached. 
We will soon start development on: 

Package Design
Alternative Mounting Options for Stretch Goals                              



GECO IN ACTION




 


FAQ'S

Q. Do You Ship to All Countries?
A. Yes, the $10 shipping fee applies to anywhere worldwide.
 
Q. Will the Camera Put Strain on my Glasses?
A. We have tested hundreds of frames and are confident that the Geco will not alter the axis of your glasses. This is, of course, reliant on the assumption that your glasses are correctly sized for your face. In our tests, the heavier the frames, the more stable they are with the Geco attached. 
 
Q. Is the Waterproof Case Safe for Saltwater, Freshwater and Chlorine?
A. Yes, the waterproof case can be used in all 3 cases.
 
Q. Does the Geco Work on Internal or External Batteries?
A.  The Geco has a built in rechargeable Lithium Polymer battery and can be charged with the USB cable included.
 
Q. Is the Geco Durable?
A. The Geco itself is made out of robust ABS plastic but we have included a safety case that is both waterproof and shockproof.
 
Q. Is It Compatible with Windows and Mac?
A. Yes the Geco is compatible with all operating systems- the format it records in is .mov H.264 encoding.
 
Q. I'm having difficulty making my contribution.
A. Our email address is gecocam@gmail.com. Please feel free to contact us for any assistance.
 
Q. How Long Will Shipping Take?
A. Shipping times vary, depending on where in the world you are. For more information please contact us.

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Design Process</h3> <p></p>
<p>After having a clear idea of how our brand should look like, <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">we started designing our watch with a few major goals in mind:</span></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Style (urban culture with a timeless look)</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Uniqueness (beeing individual with originality)</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Versatility (wearable with casual and dress outfits)</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Affordability</span>
</li>
</ul>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/913634/files/20141008014017-45.jpg?1412757617"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<p>And most importantly, a watch we would personally love to wear! <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">So, we hit the sketch pad and designed one watch after another. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We created a few 3D models by ourselves. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">That took us a few months, because we always aimed for more, always wanted </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">that perfect watch that fits to everything we could imagine. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Until we got it.

<p></p>
<p>We finally had something to show suppliers and manufacturers. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We talked to many of them! We had to make sure, that we find someone </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">who understands our vision and is able to deliver the high quality demands we have.</span></p>
<p>Now we have a great partner on our side, who enables us to have the best materials <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">and components: Stainless steel case and mesh strap, Sapphire crystal, PVD plating </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">and Swiss quartz movement! </span></p>

<p>Because we wanted our watch to fit both, women and men, we decided to keep <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">the case size reasonable. Not too large for a dress watch and not too small for a casual. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">So we went for a 41mm case diameter. But of course we wanted to keep it slim too, and </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">achieved 9mm thickness. That's what makes it a great fit for all.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""></span></p>

<p></p>
<p>As for style, we took our inspiration from different trends worldwide, and especially <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">from the urban culture. We closely looked at people, streets, buildings and clothes and </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">noticed that everything was becoming more minimalist and straight to the point. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">It´s a trend, but we believe, that it was always there. Minimalist is timeless. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Less is more.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This is also why we concentrated on essentials. We even went so far, that we decided </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">our watch should show the precise time and only what day of the week it is. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">No more, no less.</span></p>
<p>After listening to the advice and feedback of our closest family and friends, we are now proud and excited to offer a product that grew from our love and dream of creating a timeless watch, based on minimalist principles.</p>

Around the world, theft of smartphones is on the rise and
personal safety is always foremost in our minds. With this Indiegogo campaign,
we’re starting  the pushback to reclaim
your safety, and security of your iPhone. While Halo is the first smartphone case
designed to prevent theft, it also incorporates invaluable features to enhance
your iPhone, including a battery boost, external speaker, ergonomic grip and
styling, and more.  After successfully
crowdfunding the resources for initial concept and design in April 2013, our
team has spent the past six months developing and prototyping the Halo for
iPhone and we’re excited to share it with you.The Halo Ring is the world’s first proximity-based alarm for
phone theft prevention. You decide on the distance to set via the Halo app, and
the Halo Ring will trigger an alarm capable of producing 115 decibels when
separated from your device.

Designed to provide security for everyday use, Halo
minimizes the risk of theft and provides you protection when you need it most.

The Halo Ring will also protect against damage to your device from an accidental drop.



Halo’s standard alarm may also be triggered by briefly
holding the emergency button in the event you need to draw attention to
yourself. Or, you can set up personalized alarms like “Help” or
""Emergency”, which you can trigger with your own, secret, gesture control.  Simultaneously, video recording can be
triggered, a text message with GPS coordinates and a pre-set, personalized
message can be sent to designated emergency contacts.
Halo boasts a 20mm speaker so you can improve the iPhone’s
audio output.


A silent, subtle LED alert system advises you of incoming
calls and push notifications.

When you’ve been out and about all day, Halo has you covered
with a extra battery boost to increase your iPhone’s usage by an estimated 40
percent.



Shane Smith, CEO, and Karen Griffith, Design Strategist and co-founder, continue a history of innovation in a partnership that started in London in the 1990’s, spanning software platforms, email services, research products and investor communications.  Karen and Shane have both been directors of a company listed on London Stock Exchange.  They are supported by an expert team of technical and design professionals that make up the Halo Family.
Gesture control and alarmsActivation and de-activation:There are two primary activation methods: by gesture, to quickly activate a customized alarm; or by pressing the emergency button, for occasions when your phone is concealed in a pocket or bag and you may not wish to reveal it. Once activated, only you know how to de-activate it.Ø  Record motion alarm activation gestures for customized alarmsØ  Record motion alarm de-activation gesturesØ  Choose emergency button activation for standard alarm (e.g. two short presses; or one long press)Ø  Choose emergency button de-activation for standard alarmØ  Enable de-activation by fingerprintØ  Enable de-activation by PINRecording/selecting alert:Ø  Record custom voice alertØ  Download pre-recorded alertConfiguring the Halo Ring:Ø  Set maximum permissible distance for Halo RingØ  Enable de-activation by return of Halo Ring within proximityØ  Enable de-activation by fingerprintØ  Enable de-activation by PINAudio play-out:This feature is great for social listening.Ø  Tilt left to increase volumeØ  Tilt right to decrease volumePower management:The Halo case and your iPhone charge together, through the single lightning connector located at the base of the Halo – so it’s always charged when you need it.  If your phone battery is exhausted, you can use Halo as a back-up.Ø  Activate battery boost to iPhonePush notifications:Associate four currently-enabled push notifications with LED’s. Example: Email – RedSkype – BlueLine – GreeniMessage – WhitePersonal safety controls:Ø  Enable video recording when alarm is activatedØ  Send image files to nominated recipients when video activatedØ  Capture GPS location when alarm activatedØ  Pre-define phone numbers to send emergency messageØ  Record customized message associated with each phone numberØ  Enable each phone number to receive GPS location, image filesCase design:In addition to the software features, the case is designed to be held comfortably and securely. Combined with robust and high quality materials, the Halo protects your glass screen when placed face-down, and the case takes the brunt of the shock on those occasions when dropping is unavoidable.We’ve had great feedback on the project so far and hope you like it too. Thanks for your time and please check out the pledges on our page. We look forward to sending you your very own Halo iPhone case in Summer 2014.
We’ve put together the best team possible to design, build and deliver this advanced product on time and on target. The primary risks and challenges are in manufacturing logistics. For example, there might be unforeseen problems with tooling and equipment. We may also face unexpected delays in obtaining the necessary certifications. These challenges are common to all projects involving new technology, dedicated manufacturing and mass distribution. While there may be manufacturing and production delays outside of our control, we promise timely and transparent communication throughout the process.
Spread the word for a chance to win a Halo every day of this campaign.     Step 1 - Make sure you're logged into Indiegogo     Step 2 - Share this campaign on Twitter, Google+,                 or another network using the tool under our video                 at the top of this page.And that's it!

世界中で、スマートフォーンの盗難が増えてきていて個人の安全は常に我々の心で一番です。このIndiegogoキャンペーンで我々はあなたの安全やiPhoneの安全を取り戻すプッシュバックを開始します。ハローは盗難を奉仕するためにデザインされた初めてのスマートフォーン用ケースですが、バッテリーの長持ち、外部スピーカー、エルゴノミクスグリップ、スタイリング等を含んでいてiPhoneを強化し計り知れないほど貴重な特徴を取り入れます。2013年4月に最初の概念とデザインの為の資源を上手く人から集めた後、我々のチームはiPhoneの為のハローの原型を作るのに過去6か月間費やしました。そして我々はあなたに共有することに興奮しています。



ハローリングは、世界初の電話窃盗防止のためのアラームです。あなたは、ハローアプリによってセットする距離を決定します。そして、あなたの装置から切り離されるとき、ハローリングは115デシベルのアラームを起動させます。


普段用の安全を提供するためにデザインされたはろーは窃盗のリスクを少なくし、あなたが最も必要とするとき保護を提供します。

ハローリングは偶然の落下からも装置を保護します。





ハローのスタンダードアラームはあなたが自分自身に注意をひく必要がある場合、非常用のボタンを短く保持することによって引き起こされるかもしれません。もしくは、”ヘルプ”や”非常事態”のような個人化されたアラームを設定することもできます。そしてそれは、自分自身、秘密、ジェスチャーコントロールで引き起こされることが出来ます。同時に、ビデオ録画が引き起こされます。GPSによるテキスト・メッセージも調和します。そして、予め設定され、個人化されたメッセージは指定された緊急連絡先へ送信する事が出来ます。

ハローは20ｍｍのスピーカーが鳴ります。だからiPhoneの音声出力を改善する事が出来ます。








静か、巧妙なLED警報システムは、あなたに着信とプッシュ通知を知らせます。

あなたが終日出かける時、ハローは特別な充電器に変換する事が出来、あなたのiPhoneの充電を最大40%増加させます。



CEOであるシェーンスミスとデザイン戦略家のカレングリフィンや共同創設者はソフトウェアプラットホーム、電子メールサービス、研究製品や投資家とのコミュニケーションについて、1990年代にロンドンで始めて今も革新の歴史は続いています。カレンとシェーンは、ロンドン証券取引所でリストされる会社の責任者でした。ハローの家族を作る技術的でデザインのプロ専門家チームで、彼らは支えられます。







ジェスチャーコントロールとアラーム
起動と停止:
2つの主要な起動方法があります: カスタマイズされたアラームをすくに起動するためのジェスチャー; 非常用ボタンを押すことによって、電話中ポケットやカバンにあることを画し明らかにしません。一旦起動すると、あなただけが停止するやり方を知っています。


カスタマイズされた警報によりレコードモーションアラーム起動のジェスチャー 


レコードモーションアラーム停止のジェスチャー 


標準的なアラームの為に緊急ボタンの起動を選択する (例 2人の低いプレス; 1つの長いプレス) 


標準的なアラームの為に緊急ボタンの停止を選択する 


指紋によって停止を可能とする 


PINによって停止を可能にする


Recording/selecting alert:

Record custom voice alert


Download pre-recorded alert


ハローリングの構成:


ハローリングの最大許容距離を設定する 


近くでハローリングのリターンによって停止を可能にする 


Enable de-activation by fingerprint 


PINによって停止を可能にする



オーデオが尽きた: 
この特徴は社会的に聞くのに良いです。


左への傾きはボリュームを増します 


右への傾きはボリュームを減らします



パワーマネージメント:
ハローケースやIPhoneはハローのベースに位置している単電コネクターを通してチャージします。- だからあなたが必要なときいつでもチャージされます。もしあなたの電話のバッテリーを使い果たしたら、あなたはバックアップとしてハローを使用する事が出来ます。

iPhoneの為にバッテリーの増加を起動させる 


プッシュ通知:
4つの現在可能なプッシュ通知をLEDと結び付けてください。例:


電子メール
– 赤


スカイプ
– 青


ライン
– 緑


iMessage
– 白




個人安全コントロール:


アラームが起動している時ビデオの録画を可能とします 


ビデオが起動している時候補者に指名された写真ファイルを送ります 


アラームが起動している時GPSの場所をとらえます 


緊急メッセージを送信するために電話番号を前定義します 


電話番号と関連したカスタマイズされたメッセージの録画 


GPSの場所や写真ファイルを受け取るために番号を電話出来ます 



ケースのデザイン:ソフトウエア機能に加えてケースは気持ちよく確実に持たれるように設計されています。強くて高品質材料と結合され、表を下にして置かれるとき、ハローはあなたのガラスのスクリーンを保護します。そして、落とすことが避けられないとき、ケースにショックが被ります。我々はこれまでのプロジェクトにすばらしいフィードバックを頂いています。あなたが好きになることを望んでいます。時間を割いてくださってありがとうございます。我々のページ上で誓約を確認してください。我々は、2014年夏にあなたに独自のハローiPhoneケースを送ることを楽しみにします。


我々は時間やターゲットに関して先進の製品を設計、構築、届けるために最高のチームにまとめ上げました。主要な危険と挑戦は、ロジスティックスを捏造する際にあります。例えば、道具と器材に関する思いがけない問題があるかもしれません。我々は、必要な証明を得るのに予想外の遅れに直面もするかもしれません。新技術、献身的製造と大規模な配布を含んでいるすべてのプロジェクトについての挑戦は共通しています。製造がある場所や生産の遅れはあるけれど、我々はプロセスを通してタイムリーで明確なコミュニケーションを約束します。

mostly on architectural heritage building renovations, including collaborating
on a project for a building placed in a UNESCO World Heritage site, while
researching the relationship between urban processes and the way we imagine,
inhabit and use cities.<br/><br/><h3></h3><h3>Why did
we set up this campaign? What do you get out of this?</h3>We both love
architecture and passionately believe architectural debate would be much
richer if everyone chipped in.<br/><br/>A few months
ago we started working on this project, our interest stemming from the lack of
debate on architecture, urban spaces and quality of life regarding
architectural design open to the general public. Architects still revel on the
obscurity of their technical terminology and profit from the lack of
accountability on their design options.<br/><br/><p>The economic
situation in Portugal, a country under IMF scrutiny and severe austerity
measures also pushed us to pursue the creation of a box that could raise
awareness on the quality of portuguese architects, at a time when most offices
are working with the bare minimum staff, at least the lucky ones who weren´t
forced to close due to lack of work.</p>Why Siza
Vieira, might you ask? Why not start with a lesser known architect? We studied
in his buildings, we used his chairs as students, we were children when Chiado
burnt down, we used his swimming pools, we saw contemporary art in his museums...we
have a deep emotional attachment to his work, albeit a critical and judgmental one.<br/><br/><p>From that
point until inviting <b>Alex Gozblau</b>, an italian born illustrator living in
Portugal, to collaborate with us just seemed like the next logical step. His immense
<a href=""http://www.gozblau.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">body of work</a> has been featured
in several newspapers, magazines, movies, books and gallery exhibitions.<br/></p>
<p>We

measuring 25x35x5cm (approx. 9.8”x13.8”x2”), containing three views on the
earlier work of Pritzker laureate architect Álvaro Siza Vieira, through
photography, text and illustration.

Fifteen buildings were photographed for this edition and each box includes:
· 
Fifteen 20x30cm photos (approx. 7.9”x 11.8”) by Rui Pedro Bordalo;     · 
Fifteen short chronicles by João Forjaz Mendes
· 
One serigraphed illustration by Alex GozblauEach text and photo set will be carefully and individually packed, as will
the serigraphed illustration.Materials
used
The boxes will be produced in Fedrigoni Materica Gesso 360grs cardboard.
The texts will be printed in Fedrigoni Arcoprint 300grs paper;
The photos will be printed in Fedrigoni 250grs photographic semigloss paper;The illustration will be serigraphed in Fedrigoni Savile Row Plain White 250grs paper;

The individual containers will be made in Fedrigoni Golden Star K Extra
White paper.We care
about the environment, so the whole production process is FSC certified, from
the paper to the printers...Who are we?Rui is a portuguese freelance
photographer, whose work has centered on the sociological side of urban space
and the transformative power of architecture.

To fund his
photographic exploits he's had several jobs, from being a stock manager, to baker,
to commercial agent.João is an architect working
mostly on architectural heritage building renovations, including collaborating
on a project for a building placed in a UNESCO World Heritage site, while
researching the relationship between urban processes and the way we imagine,
inhabit and use cities.Why did
we set up this campaign? What do you get out of this?We both love
architecture and passionately believe architectural debate would be much
richer if everyone chipped in.A few months
ago we started working on this project, our interest stemming from the lack of
debate on architecture, urban spaces and quality of life regarding
architectural design open to the general public. Architects still revel on the
obscurity of their technical terminology and profit from the lack of
accountability on their design options.The economic
situation in Portugal, a country under IMF scrutiny and severe austerity
measures also pushed us to pursue the creation of a box that could raise
awareness on the quality of portuguese architects, at a time when most offices
are working with the bare minimum staff, at least the lucky ones who weren´t
forced to close due to lack of work.Why Siza
Vieira, might you ask? Why not start with a lesser known architect? We studied
in his buildings, we used his chairs as students, we were children when Chiado
burnt down, we used his swimming pools, we saw contemporary art in his museums...we
have a deep emotional attachment to his work, albeit a critical and judgmental one.From that
point until inviting Alex Gozblau, an italian born illustrator living in
Portugal, to collaborate with us just seemed like the next logical step. His immense
body of work has been featured
in several newspapers, magazines, movies, books and gallery exhibitions.
We
challenged him because of his diametrically opposite graphic style to that of Siza
Vieira.As much as we'd like this idea to go forward, we need
money, that's the truth of it.Even after
getting the support of italian fine papers producer Fedrigoni, who liked our idea and the project we

<p>Hello, My name is Pavlo and I'm creator of OKTIE wooden accessories. How does I start doing it? All started summer 2014 when my friend professional wedding photographer (as I am) asked me to help him with wedding shots he made to complete them in short time. Groom on that pictures had an excellent wooden bow tie, I haven't seen wooden bow ties before and it's impressed me so I desired one to myself, but I couldn't find that tie anywhere so I tried to made it on my own. In a process I added some few thins from My self and create absolute new and unique bowtie (it presented in my store as OKTIE 1 ). That tie impressed few of my closest friend and I made as a gift for them some new ties. After a while people started ask me about my ties and making orders - so I decide to make a production and sale my product. All that time I was making all the wood works and my mother helped me with sewing works on bowties, so family business started.</p>

Project One Geometry is built on the idea that everyone is enticed to one or more geometrical shapes and sizes. We strive to create products of great aesthetic appeal with practical usability in our modern world. Our aim is to keep geometries simple and elegant so that it captivates and functions sensibly.Brief BackgroundWe're from Singapore, a tiny but busy country. Both of us are graduates from Singapore Polytechnic, School of Architecture and the Built Environment (Ben) and School of business (Dalston). This is also the year of our 21st, which would mark the beginning of a new chapter in the army 3-4 months from now. Yes, we are soldiers soon-to-be who would be serving our mandatory national service for 2 years!  Why we have started this campaign?Well, after graduating, we had about 5 -6 months of free time before serving the army. Couldn't figure out what to do yet, we had decided to work on this wallet project which was brainstormed 3 years ago. The PIG Wallet is designed to be an elegant Hard Case Wallet to be held on the hands. Sure it can be kept in the pockets, but never the back pockets because sitting on an unaligned upright posture as a result of a bulk beneath your butt could lead to back ache and complications. Always empty your back pockets when seated. If all goes well, we would develop similar products in future, preferably 2 years later, after our respective national services end. What We Need & What You Will Get
First, we need to customize a mold for plastic injection molding at a cost of at least USD$ 10 000
Then, we need to ensure that at least 3500 orders are made to fulfill the minimum requirements of bulk manufacturing here in Singapore.
All products and quality checks are proudly done in Singapore
We have created an 'All-or Nothing'  fixed funding model because this project can only be truly realized by reaching the required funds. 
Taking into account of delivery service and packaging charges on our part, we try our best to keep the PIG Wallet affordable
Funds will be returned to backers if the project is unable to reach its goal.
At present, we offer only Gray or Black PIG Wallets. More colours will come if funds allow :).
The ImpactIf this project is realized, we look forward to creating more products that are similar in nature, but differing in its respective functions.

Odio, partage de la musique




Until now, all the audio devices have been created to make the audio for one person only. Now we offer you , through a patent pending solution, to listen with your friends to the same music.
So this is the first speaker where everybody listen the same music

 

Tous les systèmes de reproduction de la musique sont conçus pour une seule personne. Voici le premier hautparleur qui est réalisé pour que tous vos amis entendent la même chose que vous.









This has been invented by Jean-Marc to simplify listening to music. No hassle, good music.
 
In comparison, this is how our competitors are making the music for you, only one person can listen nicely to the music

 

Ce concept a été inventé par Jean-Marc pour simplifier l’écoute de la musique. Facile pour juste écouter la musique et oublier le reste. Tous ceux qui sont autour de l’ODIOCUBE entendent la même qualité de musique.
Le résultat des autres : une seule personne écoute, les autres bof…









Remember: Bad sound kills good music. And ruin your evening too....

 

Une petite photo prise en Suède: traduction libre: un mauvais son tue la bonne musique, et rends votre soirée aussi pénible.. !




 




The idea is mature and all people who listen to the prototype love it, are impressed and ready to buy. Why cannot we make it?

 
Toutes les personnes qui ont écouté notre prototype fonctionnel sont enthousiastes et voudrait l’acheter… Pourquoi n’est-il pas disponible?

The design was based on the look and feel of precision tools from the 50s and 60s. The same aesthetic theme inspires this new project: another beautifully made mechanical device. The lower crown controls the slide rule under the crystalThe circular slide rule allows you to multiply and divide numbers. You can also set it up as a handy conversion tool for units of measure or currencies. The Caliper circular steel slide ruleEvery watch includes a 3 inch (8 cm) circular steel slide rule. To ensure you can make the best use of both slide rules, we're including instructions. After all, using a slide rule has become a lost art. In the Media:""Caliper has already shipped its minimalist watches after a few successful Kickstarter campaigns and I’m really pleased with this one. It’s very rare to find a unique timepiece with a unique complication."" Read More>>  - John Biggs, Tech Crunch  ""The movable internal bezel dominates and defines the watch, and I have to say, it is pretty cool."" Read More >>- The Time Bum ""Get more out of your timepiece when you wear the Caliper Slide Rule Mechanical Watch. This watch features an impressive tool: an integrated slide rule."" Read More >>- Ashley, The Gadget Flow ""A clever design and striking timepiece in its own right have made this a thoroughly impressive construction in our opinion here at The Coolector and for those of you that demand more than the norm from your watches, this will be right up your street."" Read More>>- Leo Davie, The Coolector ""They plan on shipping in February 2018 but I saw a working model complete with circular slide rule and was very impressed."" Read More>>- John Biggs, Wrist Watch ReviewUsing a Circular Slide RuleWith a bit of practice, you'll find it a useful tool.  Example: Multiply 35 times 6  To multiply two numbers, align the first number to the arrow at 1. Find the second number on the same ring as the arrow and read across to find the result.Multiply 35 times 6Example: Divide 450 by 6  To divide a number by another number, align the two numbers to each other. Read the result across from the arrow on the ring with the number you are dividing by – the ring with the denominator.Divide 450 by 6Conversion factors on the rear of the steel slide ruleInspirationCaliper Timepieces harken back to the era of precision instrumentation - when the inner mechanics of our most important tools and devices were crafted for accuracy, dependability and longevity. Caliper Timepieces are a tribute to all that came before the planned obsolescence of the consumer age.Technical instruments before the age of electronics Prototype VersionsWe have developed two prototype versions of the Caliper Slide View. The A1O features a black case and black interior slide rule with a dark, semi transparent watch face and an orange second hand:Version A1OThe Caliper Slide View D1B features black case and white interior slide rule with a dark, semi transparent watch face and an blue second hand:Version D1B Proposed Additional VersionsBased on feedback from backers and others, we are developing three more options. These three are proposed designs that may evolve slightly so we would love to hear your feedback and suggestions.  Version B3O features a brushed stainless steel case and band. The face is a crisp opaque white face with black markers. We’ve included a set of common conversion factors on the face in a circle.Version B3O Version B4O is a stainless steel watch with a white slide rule and clear glass watch face. The hands will be white with lume and the hour and minute markers will be black over clear glass.Version B4OVersion D2B is a black case version with a white slide rule and a set of conversion factors printed on the glass face in two blocks at 3 and 9.Version D2BSteel circular slide rule with conversion factors on reverse sideTechnical SpecificationsThe Caliper Slide View is a sophisticated machine. Our aim has been to develop the best watch and slide-rule that we could offer at a retail price under US$500. Kickstarter backers will be able to get it for substantially less.We've selected the Japanese made Miyota 82S0 as the movement for the Slide View. This is a reliable and well-regarded movement. A key feature of this little machine is that it has an 'open heart' - the balance wheel and escapement are visible from the front. The movement is purely mechanical and requires no battery. It is self-winding, which means that the motion of your daily activities provides the power to keep it running. The case is milled from a very high quality steel know as 316L. The black surface is applied to the steel using a process called IP (ion plating) which is a form of PVD (physical vapor deposition). It's a very tough coating that is chemically bonded to the steel. The watch is designed to be water resistant up to 10 atmospheres of static pressure. The glass on the front - the crystal - is sapphire which is will prevent it from getting scratched. We've also included glass on the back to show the inner workings. The watch face at first appears to be a simple dark grey surface, but you soon discover that it is made of dark glass and that you can see the movement ticking away underneath.The Caliper Slide View utilizes screw-down crowns. This feature will make the watch more secure and robust - in that the crowns will be screwed into the case while not in use. For the slide rule, it will also ensure that the scale is not accidentally moved – a crucial factor if you’ve set up your watch for currency or unit conversion.Screw Down CrownsCaliper Slide View Dimensions - Units are 1/100 mm

<p></p>SHORT
SUMMARY</span><br/>
</h3><p>
</p><p>My name is Katty and I
am a designer based in London. I have launched an accessories label called
Katty Janneh. I am here on Indiegogo, to raise £7000 to take my first
collection to market.</p>
<p> I design and create millinery and accessories
with a modern elegance, using colour and different embellishments to make my
designs distinctive, bringing a sense of occasion to everyday wear. My target
market is designer fashion. My previous stockist was Selfridges london in my former self as a milliner</p>
<p>I also offer a bespoke
millinery service from my London studio. Ideal for special occasions such as
Weddings, Royal Ascot, Melbourne Cup and catwalk accessories</p><p></p><p>  </p>
<p>WHAT
I NEED…AND WHAT <b>YOU</b> GET!</p>
<p>I am going for fixed funding…all
or nothing. The funding is going towards 2 main areas to bring my first
accessories collection to market for the upcoming Autumn &amp; Winter 2015/6
buying season (
yes really!...your favourite shops are already planning what they want to sell
you next winter!)</p>
<p>Below is the budget for the
money raised;</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1019804/files/20141116110417-pie_chart.jpg?1416164657"" src="""" style=""""/><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;'>If I do not raise my target, i will be unable to complete the collection, And I
would miss the season. Finances are low, there are no savings, so I
would have to take a break and work full time for 6 months to a year, to
generate funds to get a collection together. I would lick my wounds, learn the
lessons from this pitch and find my way forward.</span></p><p><b>THE PERKS</b></p>

SUMMARY

My name is Katty and I
am a designer based in London. I have launched an accessories label called
Katty Janneh. I am here on Indiegogo, to raise £7000 to take my first
collection to market.
 I design and create millinery and accessories
with a modern elegance, using colour and different embellishments to make my
designs distinctive, bringing a sense of occasion to everyday wear. My target
market is designer fashion. My previous stockist was Selfridges london in my former self as a milliner
I also offer a bespoke
millinery service from my London studio. Ideal for special occasions such as
Weddings, Royal Ascot, Melbourne Cup and catwalk accessories  
WHAT
I NEED…AND WHAT YOU GET!
I am going for fixed funding…all
or nothing. The funding is going towards 2 main areas to bring my first
accessories collection to market for the upcoming Autumn & Winter 2015/6
buying season (
yes really!...your favourite shops are already planning what they want to sell
you next winter!)
Below is the budget for the
money raised;If I do not raise my target, i will be unable to complete the collection, And I
would miss the season. Finances are low, there are no savings, so I
would have to take a break and work full time for 6 months to a year, to
generate funds to get a collection together. I would lick my wounds, learn the
lessons from this pitch and find my way forward.THE PERKS
I have a range of Perks to
appeal to my target clients;                              The Six Week Millinery CoursesI have been teaching millinery for beginners since 2002, privately and at local FE colleges and at now defunct Make Lounge. I am based in within a lovely
set of preserved Victorian work yard studios called Pullens Yards. The course
is suitable for beginners, it will be beneficial if you do have hand sewing
experience.
Using model millinery methods,
you will be taught how to block, sew & trim your very own hat. (Materials will be extra

campaign to keep updated.



THE IMPACT
The impact will be immediate if
the target is reached. The money will enable me to move
faster, get like Nike and just.do.it !
It will also validate my
designs, I am introducing different accessories and this is the first showcase.
To have a successful campaign will prove that there is a space in the market,
and that my accessories can fill it.
As the elves decided to stay
with the shoemaker, I need to have help in the studio. I have spent the last 18
months planning and restructuring. I did a business course at Doug Richard's
School for Creative Startups, built a new website and have sourced production
for the range of new soft caps.
Wearing all these different
‘hats’ for the business, I cannot continue to do everything alone, it slows my
progress and it is not something I can maintain long term. 
Being able to take on a Fashion
Marketing/Promotion intern will give me the space I need to focus on producing
quality. 
I am experienced in Luxury
Retail and Education and have worked with interns before. I can give
constructive and creative direction in order to achieve the desired results. I
prefer working with someone in the Studio rather than a virtual assistant as I
remember how much interning benefitted me.
Your input contributes to the next
part of the journey and demonstrates your belief in my ability to achieve my
goals and turn Katty Janneh into a successful British accessories label.

The Charme Beret.

This is due to the fact that in many parts of the world, students do not have access to their own textbooks, and if they do, they are most likely very outdated and have to be shared with many other students. After seeing this lack of textbooks and school supplies firsthand on a service trip to the Dominican Republic, we decided to build a brand dedicated to solving this problem. Pan aims to bring you comfortable and timeless clothing, while providing textbooks and school supplies to classrooms in underfunded areas of the world. Every time you wear a Pan shirt, know that you provided 5 children with their first textbook. Feel Good, Do Good.

<p>ZL HYPOFLECT (to reflect from below) brings a new standard in reflective technology. ZL’s proprietary process applies high performance reflective prints onto high quality fabrics. The result - superior technical apparel for even the most extreme situations.</p>
<p>Hypoflect features our unique monogram print. No longer will you need to wear unexciting monochrome fluorescent reflectives to stay safe!</p>
<p>Hypoflect provides 360° visibility from any light source from a distance, yet remains semi transparent during the day, meaning your ZL garment is the most versatile piece of clothing you will own. Look hyper cool during the day, but be hyper safe during the night.</p>
<p>The durability of Hypoflect has been field tested extensively during the 2 years of prototyping, where we took our products to the most extreme of conditions, making sure they won’t let you down.</p>

<p>Our key goal when starting this journey was to create an active jacket with a fashion-forward design and emphasis on the quality of the materials and components.</p>
<p>We have created a brand new reflective that is levels ahead of any on the market.</p>
<p>Hypoflect reflects a major breakthrough in this material technology. We have made the brightest and most eye catching garments, that can be seen from over 200 feet away. Not only have we created an active jacket with modern fashion influence, we also created an extremely safe and durable reflective material that will ultimately help save lives.</p>

<p>In 2017 there were 5,977 pedestrians and 783 bicyclists killed in crashes with motor vehicles in the US alone. Together these vulnerable road users account for a growing share of total US traffic fatalities: in 2017 pedestrians and cyclists accounted for 18.2 percent of traffic fatalities (an increase of 32% over the 10 year period prior).</p>
<p>Lighting conditions are a major factor - for example three quarters of pedestrian fatalities in the US occur in dark conditions.</p>
<p>This is one of the major reasons why we decided to start this project. With the steady growth in population, the roads are only getting more congested. We hope that our materials can keep our customers safe, making our journey worthwhile.</p>

<p>For the past 80+ years, reflective design hasn't seen any change. Most of you may be familiar with 3M reflective. You may have seen it on everything from fashion wear to construction jackets, and everything in between. It was first created in 1937 and since then, it hasn't been innovated. This type of reflective is mass produced and used by just about every company when incorporating reflectives. 3M had the first breakthrough in reflective technology, ZL has what would be considered the second real breakthrough. We have have created a brand new reflective that hasn't been done or seen until now.</p>

<p>We launched our first crowdfunding campaign 11 months ago and with the support of the crowdfunding community, we were able to make it a roaring success! We are no longer crowdfunding newbies and have thoroughly enjoyed and learned so much from our first campaign, from the manufacturing over 3000 individual items to fulfillment to over 50 countries with our Z-Liner Insoles and we truly learned a lot! Our team has been working closely with our manufacturing partners and logistics companies, to ensure we get your new ZL garments to you as soon as possible without any delays. We work side by side with our manufacturing partners and oversee the use of our proprietary technology and quality control in the production of our jackets. We do not envisage any delays or hiccups. With that being said, we do realize things don't always go as planned. If we do foresee the unlikely scenario of delays to your pledges, we promise to communicate with transparency and work day and night to ensure your expectations are met and disruptions are reduced to a minimum!</p>
</div></div>","ZL HYPOFLECT (to reflect from below) brings a new standard in reflective technology. ZL’s proprietary process applies high performance reflective prints onto high quality fabrics. The result - superior technical apparel for even the most extreme situations.
Hypoflect features our unique monogram print. No longer will you need to wear unexciting monochrome fluorescent reflectives to stay safe!
Hypoflect provides 360° visibility from any light source from a distance, yet remains semi transparent during the day, meaning your ZL garment is the most versatile piece of clothing you will own. Look hyper cool during the day, but be hyper safe during the night.
The durability of Hypoflect has been field tested extensively during the 2 years of prototyping, where we took our products to the most extreme of conditions, making sure they won’t let you down.


Our garments are made for the outdoors. Specifically engineered to be breathable, as well as to keep in the heat, our heat ceramic technology regulates body temperature.
Run, cycle, train, hike or commute - your jacket will keep you ventilated.

Winter Camo

Rain shouldn’t keep you from doing what you want to do. Our garments have a water repellent coating to prevent absorption of rainwater, yet also retain breathability, ensuring your comfort from start to finish.

Blue Vortex

We know that you need your jacket to be lightweight for everyday wear, yet durable enough to stand the test of time. We cannot emphasize the ZL quality enough. Our ZL jackets are built with top of the line, industry leading components and materials, whilst also being equipped with our Hypoflect material of the future.

All of these properties are designed for the materials to work in unison with our HYPOFLECT technology to provide the ultimate premium reflective clothing. Our products are made to assist you in a variety of activities, both active and casual.





 
Our key goal when starting this journey was to create an active jacket with a fashion-forward design and emphasis on the quality of the materials and components.
We have created a brand new reflective that is levels ahead of any on the market.
Hypoflect reflects a major breakthrough in this material technology. We have made the brightest and most eye catching garments, that can be seen from over 200 feet away. Not only have we created an active jacket with modern fashion influence, we also created an extremely safe and durable reflective material that will ultimately help save lives.

In 2017 there were 5,977 pedestrians and 783 bicyclists killed in crashes with motor vehicles in the US alone. Together these vulnerable road users account for a growing share of total US traffic fatalities: in 2017 pedestrians and cyclists accounted for 18.2 percent of traffic fatalities (an increase of 32% over the 10 year period prior).
Lighting conditions are a major factor - for example three quarters of pedestrian fatalities in the US occur in dark conditions.
This is one of the major reasons why we decided to start this project. With the steady growth in population, the roads are only getting more congested. We hope that our materials can keep our customers safe, making our journey worthwhile.
 

For the past 80+ years, reflective design hasn't seen any change. Most of you may be familiar with 3M reflective. You may have seen it on everything from fashion wear to construction jackets, and everything in between. It was first created in 1937 and since then, it hasn't been innovated. This type of reflective is mass produced and used by just about every company when incorporating reflectives. 3M had the first breakthrough in reflective technology, ZL has what would be considered the second real breakthrough. We have have created a brand new reflective that hasn't been done or seen until now.

 
 We are here to change that. As a London-based company, we inspire to set the bar even higher within modern fashion while also applying an advanced twist. We take everything a few steps further. You may be familiar with us from our previous Kickstarter - our Z-Liner High Performance Honeycomb insoles. We ended our campaign over 1000% funded and have been rolling ever since! We are a team that make design and quality our utmost importance. If it’s ZL, expect advanced, expect premium.

 In 2014 we started developing our newest in-house technology, “Hypoflect” (to reflect from under). It was a project aimed at creating a new type of medium that could be used on any garment or material of our choice. We wanted to create the future of reflectives.

This will allow users to query online services and control other Android-powered devices using simple voice commands. It also improves Z’s ﬁtness tracking abilities and enhances how that collected data is shown to the user. Z comes packed with great software but can also download apps from the Google Play store so you can add all your favorites right to your wrist. To complete the device, inWatch has included a sapphire crystal face and ceramic back cover, features usually only seen in luxury watches. They protect Z and compliment the durable aluminum body nicely. It is scratch, impact and splash resistant, making it a clear choice for those looking to join the one device movement.</span></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><span><br/></span></span></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p><h2 style=""font-weight: bold;""><a name=""about"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">About</a></h2><p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/550796/files/20140501182009-inwatch-logo.jpg?1398993609"" src="""" style=""width: 594.69px; height: 168px;""/></p><p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>

We call it a revolution.  inWatch Z combines the luxury and design of an elegant watch with the brilliant technology of a high end smart phone.  The result is nothing less than incredible. Your true all in one device is finally here.  Meet Z!Click here to jump to the specs!
Let's Talk About HardwareUI, Software and PlatformAbout inWatchKey Specifications & FeaturesPerks ExploredWhy Z?InWatch Z in ActionMeet the TeamInWatch Z and the Competition
About ZWouldn’t it be nice if your watch could do more? What if it could do way more? The one device movement is here and it is ﬁnally possible to stay connected without a phone in your pocket or purse. inWatch Z is a sleek, stylish smart watch but has a full-featured smart phone tucked inside as well. An HD camera, bone conductivity speaker and 1.2 GHz dual-core A7 processor make this device a true all-in-one wearable. While it doesn't need a phone to be smart, Z pairs perfectly with one and can also function as a companion device. Z is “tech meets fashion” without the usual compromises.   Let's Talk Hardware• We started by deciding what the ideal proportion of the display would be in order to deliver high functionality but avoid a cumbersome form factor. We decided on a 240X240 semi-transparent TFT. It adjusts screen luminance automatically base on the ambient light, making Z easily viewable in full sunlight. Day or night, inWatch Z has your back.• The 28nanometer ARM Cortex A7 dual core 1.2GHz processor provides the computing power for Z. Nanometer technology connects circuits at a microscopic level providing 50% higher speed, 50% reduced energy consumption when switching on & off, a technical framework for power saving and the perfect system optimization. Performance and power dissipation in a smaller package allows more standby time so your watch will be running when you need it.• inWatch Z supports Multi network 3G coverage as well as WIFI, Bluetooth and GPS. Control your stereo or jump online at the coffee shop without using minutes. Put any SIM card in the watch to activate YOUR network. No new contract, no new expense. • 720p HD video recording capabilities allow you to create true and lasting video. The 5MP camera also takes crisp stills with the tap of a finger. Record every remarkable moment to share with your family and friends.• Z has performance 3D hardware graphic processing (MALI-400MP) for GPU visualization. It stores and protect the graphic resources which maximize the function of CPU and GPU to ensure the speed of web surfing and application performance stays as high as possible.• MiraVision is the most advanced image display technology available for mobile devices. Its software and hardware offers the same degree of clarity and sharpness as DTV image processing on a small screen. Power efficiency has been addressed and boosted through the Ambient-Light Adaptive Luma (AAL) technology, which intelligently adjusts the panel backlight in response to the ambient light intensity and the displayed contents to simultaneously optimize battery life and viewing experience.• The bone conduction system is your “invisible speaker”. It lets you hear the phone clearly even in a noisy environment by touching the speaker to your temple. You can also turn almost any surface into a speaker by just pressing it against the watch clasp. 
• inWatch Z includes a nine axis sensor, gravity, terrestrial
magnetism and gyroscopic sensor all in one. It collects pulse, pedometer and
calories burned data so you can develop good habits and keep a record for
healthier living.Z
can display the weather, temperature, elevation and other area data in
real-time, putting environment data and your performance info at your
fingertips.• Z has a width of 1.5"", a height of 2.3"" and a thinness of just .5""UI, Software and PlatformThe user interface for inWatch Z is designed around Google’s recently announced Android Wear platform. This will allow users to query online services and control other Android-powered devices using simple voice commands. It also improves Z’s ﬁtness tracking abilities and enhances how that collected data is shown to the user. Z comes packed with great software but can also download apps from the Google Play store so you can add all your favorites right to your wrist. To complete the device, inWatch has included a sapphire crystal face and ceramic back cover, features usually only seen in luxury watches. They protect Z and compliment the durable aluminum body nicely. It is scratch, impact and splash resistant, making it a clear choice for those looking to join the one device movement.About

We're tired of the smartwatches on the market today that aim to imitate our smartphones rather than compliment their functionality, quickly becoming overly complicated and lacking all style.So, we came together to create the perfect modern smartwatch. A smartwatch that focused on simplifying our unique modern lifestyles, while still looking incredible.Now we are finally proud to introduce the Flux Luxury Smartwatch.Everything a smartwatch should be, and nothing it shouldn’t.STYLEWe didn’t want the Flux to look like another boring smart watch, we wanted it to have style. So we gave it the looks of a vintage luxury watch with real functional analogue watch hands.We also wanted the Flux to be customizable, so we give the buyer the option of three different watch case colors as well as three different strap styles to choose from. All watch straps have a quick release function, allowing you to switch between watch straps in seconds, and even add your own.Perhaps most importantly, we wanted the Flux to be tough. We started by giving the Flux a rugged brushed stainless-steel case. Next, we replaced the classic glass watch face with scratch resistant sapphire crystal. Finally, we sealed the Flux, making it IP67 water resistant.Next, we focused on giving the flux simple smart functionalitySMART FUNCTIONALITYWe focused on adding smart functionality that simplifies and enhances our modern lifestyles.So we started by giving the Flux a groundbreakingly vibrant E-ink display under the watch hands.Our e-ink technology is extremely power efficient, lasting 30 days in full use off a single charge.  Next, we focused on the basis of every smartwatch: notifications. Again, we kept it simple. The Flux vibrates and displays unique E-ink icons for calls, texts, emails, alarms, and calendar events.The Flux is a perfect combination of simple smart watch functionality and style, but we weren’t done.We wanted the Flux to fit YOUR unique modern lifestyle. So we broke it down and gave the Flux 4 modes to compliment your modern life.01. BusinessWe added Business mode to help you stay organized and on-time. In business mode the Flux syncs with your smartphone calendar to display the times off upcoming events or appointments directly on the watch face.02. SportsWe added sports mode to help you stay healthy and crush your fitness goals. Set your daily step goal in the flux app and see your progress on the watch face as you move throughout the day.  We also added a heart rate monitor to the Flux allowing the user to get an accurate reading with just the click of a button.03. Casual ModeWe wanted to add a mode that was all about style, so we created casual mode. Displaying all notifications, counting seconds on the watch face, and digitally displaying the date or time, casual mode gives the Flux a minimal modern stylish design.04. Power SavingWhen you want to get away from it all, we created power saving mode. Power saving mode turns off all smart notifications, transforming the watch into an elegant analogue timepiece, and extending the battery life to 6 months.PriceWe wanted to the Flux to be affordable, so we cut out the middle man and maximized our production efficiency to bring the Flux to you for just $100, a quarter of the price of other leading smartwatches on the market. The Flux is the perfect everyday smartwatch.Thank you, Indiegogo, for helping us bring our watch to the market!",15.0,0,"1 Campaign

Romeow’s Story

We all
would like to spend more time with our pets but our daily business doesn't
always allow us this time.
But if
there are moments in which our presence is indispensible, in others  we can fortunately use technology to be there
for our furry friends.
This is also my story, explained Alessandro, Romeow’s
creator.  
“Often I am forced to be away for a couple
of days for work commitments. Until today the choice was either to leave my cat
in a boarding house, from which he would always return stressed, or to leave
him at home alone, but with the worry that the automatic food dispenser would
not work or that Holly, my cat, would not eat.

I knew that my worry  was shared by the most pet owners, that's why
the idea of Romeow, in order to improve our frenetic life and our pet life”.



The System



Romeow is the first system, made in Italy, made to remotely manage the
feeding of our pets.
Thanks it you and your pet will feel in constant contact each other.


Our Romeow is composed of a dispenser, a smartphone app and 2 bowls
included.  
The dispenser, connected to your home WIFI, has inside a water and a dry
food storage, a web cam and a speaker system.  


Through its intuitive application, your are able to control and program
Romeow via smartphone or tablet.
With just two click, you can decide when and how much to refill your
pet’s bowls: just right now or for the next days.




How It Works




Let’s see our pet!
Romeow allows you to see and check out your pet and its bowls. With its
grand angle eye, the integrated webcam, it’s possible to see at any moment if
the bowls are full or they have been emptied and therefore if your beloved pet
has been eating.
The possibility to see how your pet eats, is the first way to understand
if it is healthy and it’s an easy way to delete our anxiety when we are out of
home. 


Let’s schedule the diet!
The app
is designed to easily control and set your Romeow.
If an
unexpected meeting at work, keep us longer in the office, the app allows us
fill the bowls in few seconds from the meeting room without your boss noticing.
But of
course, you can also plan in advance. Just setting in the calendar app, when
the food and water should be dispensed, Romeow will take care of it and you
will be calm and you’ll be also free to program a weekend off.
Let’s talk with it!
Romeow has a voice, your voice! We have add a speaker system to the
dispenser to let you call your pet and him hear the owner’s voice when the meal
is served.
Trough your smartphone mic you can send an instant vocal message to the
Romeow or you can set it as default message when Romeow refill the dry food
bowls.
Your furry friend, maybe, will not answer you but it'd feel you closer
when it’s alone at home.





The Device Specs



CAPACITY
Romeow has a food capacity of 1,8
kilos, and a water capacity of 2,5 litres. The internal containers are made

The bowls
are set in a groove so that they remain in the correct position for refilling
and resisting the impetuosity of your little beast when they are hungry. The bowls and the

The
computer and electronics of the device are protected in a compartment that is

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>Who We Are</u></strong></h2>
<p>This campaign is being run by <strong>Sugar Cube Productions</strong>, a UK-based promotional product company. The pandemic has hit the company hard, so I’ve decided to focus on creating products for a community that I cherish.</p>
<p>I’ve been a part of the subreddit<i>WallStreetsBetsNew</i> since January and am a moderator for their <a href=""https://discord.com/invite/wallstreetbetsnew"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Discord</a>. Since joining, I’ve bonded with incredible members of the community and have learned more about the financial market in the last four months than I have over the past five years!</p>
<p>Being invested in the community and the stock, I began noticing comments about the iconic DFV headband and how people wished they could own something similar yet more original. The one wrinkle in my brain went to work and, with the help of some incredible apes, we came up with this line of meme stock gear!</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u>Why Crowdfunding?</u></h2>
<p>Selling a product costs money, time, and space. By crowdfunding, we can create the exact amount that's demanded. This ensures that we won't run out of stock or have any leftover product, all while minimizing shipping costs by supplying everything in one order.</p>
<p>When these factors are in place, we can offer you a high-quality product at a lower price!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>This is an <strong>ALL OR NOTHING campaign.</strong>  If we don't hit the goal then you won’t be charged for your order, but we also won't be able to afford to send you this iconic gear!</i></p>
</div><div>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>Sourcing + Order Fulfillment</strong></u></h2>
<p>We utilize factories in both China and the United Kingdom to provide our items, depending on quantities and complexities. We have worked with all of our suppliers before, and know that they provide high-quality items. However, due to the pandemic and the uncertain geopolitical climate, production and shipping to our warehouse might take longer than anticipated.</p>
<p>International orders may be subjected to import duties. There are new EU VAT laws on the way, and we're not sure how they'll affect things. We will try to minimize any additional import costs, but you will be responsible for any additional fees.</p>

Though smart watches have become a trend, the growth rate is not what was initially projected to be since it all began. The major drawback issue with adaptability to an electronic smart watch as per the user has always been its form factor and aesthetics. To overcome this issue the concept of strap changing came into play which almost all brands followed. Though if we view a smart watch, the majority 70% of the onlookers vision falls on the bezel and not the strap, hence if we think about it, it does not really solve the problem. A watch is an important element of fashion and function in our daily lives. On different occasions, people wear different styles. If a suitable watch is needed for every occasion, it will be an economic burden for consumers and waste of resources. The proposed application of replaceable chassis lets the user have the ability to change not only the strap but also the bezel design in its entirety as one unit in terms of aesthetic, material, structural and mechanical design thereby completely changing its appearance. In terms of economic stand point it also lets the user switch to a completely new design watch reducing the cost to half as compared to purchasing a completely new design watch product.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>THE AMALGAM OF MODERNITY, TECHNOLOGY AND STYLE!  </i></strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Besides being the world's first chassis switchable smart watch, the Karacus Switch is a featured packed smart watch latest in technology with many smart functions for the user providing various phone notifications and fitness tracking data on your wrist.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1589978587/owrkpru3ixngpmelyfqp.png"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1584363468/let7475acq3lz8tk7rkc.jpg"" src=""""/></h3><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/jsxHmJ1lm6Du9L5ZYq/source.gif"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING AS WE PLAN TO KEEP PRODUCING MANY AND WHOLE NEW COLLECTION OF EXQUISITE CHASSIS DESIGNS TO SWITCH YOUR STYLE!

It is made of matte finish metallic casing enclosing all electronic components of the smart watch. Part B are the various design chassis which are the bezel attached to straps as a single unit in its entirety. The universal module is taken and inserted into the chassis from the bottom end and pushed in upwards motion until its fixed. The inner walls of the chassis bezel consists of silicone strip padding. Due to the interference between the matte finish of the universal module and the silicone strip, compression and frictional forces come into play. Due to these forces the universal module is securely fastened and does not fall down and neither can it fall outwards due to the bezel material blockage at the top end. The universal module can be easily removed from the chassis by pressing the screen from the top side thereby ensuring easy insertion and extraction when changing the chassis.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1584532289/jcoto3vttqb6ix8f1olu.png"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/jRMtj2GueqXD8UXonG/source.gif"" src=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>EASILY INSERT ELECTRONIC MODULE INTO CHASSIS</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/jmSWXkGlVEKSgxN8ih/source.gif"" src="""" style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 24px;font-weight: 700;letter-spacing: 0px;""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>EASILY EXTRACT ELECTRONIC MODULE TO REPLACE CHASSIS DESIGN</strong></p><p style=""text-align: center;""> </p><p><strong>USER INTERACTION</strong><br/>The Karacus Switch smart watch is sold as a sports edition base product as a complete unit with electronic module assembled with sports chassis.

Though smart watches have become a trend, the growth rate is not what was initially projected to be since it all began. The major drawback issue with adaptability to an electronic smart watch as per the user has always been its form factor and aesthetics. To overcome this issue the concept of strap changing came into play which almost all brands followed. Though if we view a smart watch, the majority 70% of the onlookers vision falls on the bezel and not the strap, hence if we think about it, it does not really solve the problem. A watch is an important element of fashion and function in our daily lives. On different occasions, people wear different styles. If a suitable watch is needed for every occasion, it will be an economic burden for consumers and waste of resources. The proposed application of replaceable chassis lets the user have the ability to change not only the strap but also the bezel design in its entirety as one unit in terms of aesthetic, material, structural and mechanical design thereby completely changing its appearance. In terms of economic stand point it also lets the user switch to a completely new design watch reducing the cost to half as compared to purchasing a completely new design watch product.THE AMALGAM OF MODERNITY, TECHNOLOGY AND STYLE!  Besides being the world's first chassis switchable smart watch, the Karacus Switch is a featured packed smart watch latest in technology with many smart functions for the user providing various phone notifications and fitness tracking data on your wrist.   THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING AS WE PLAN TO KEEP PRODUCING MANY AND WHOLE NEW COLLECTION OF EXQUISITE CHASSIS DESIGNS TO SWITCH YOUR STYLE! A REVOLUTION HAS BEGUN JOIN THE MOVEMENT! SOME CAD BEZEL DESIGNS CURRENTLY IN R&D FOR NEXT LINE OF CHASSIS PLANNING TO UTILIZE MATERIALS SUCH AS WOODEN, CERAMIC, TITANIUM, LEATHER AND MANY MORE!  HOW IT WORKSPart A of the product is the universal electronic module. It is made of matte finish metallic casing enclosing all electronic components of the smart watch. Part B are the various design chassis which are the bezel attached to straps as a single unit in its entirety. The universal module is taken and inserted into the chassis from the bottom end and pushed in upwards motion until its fixed. The inner walls of the chassis bezel consists of silicone strip padding. Due to the interference between the matte finish of the universal module and the silicone strip, compression and frictional forces come into play. Due to these forces the universal module is securely fastened and does not fall down and neither can it fall outwards due to the bezel material blockage at the top end. The universal module can be easily removed from the chassis by pressing the screen from the top side thereby ensuring easy insertion and extraction when changing the chassis.  EASILY INSERT ELECTRONIC MODULE INTO CHASSIS EASILY EXTRACT ELECTRONIC MODULE TO REPLACE CHASSIS DESIGN USER INTERACTIONThe Karacus Switch smart watch is sold as a sports edition base product as a complete unit with electronic module assembled with sports chassis. It all starts as a sports smart watch ensuring the user receives necessary functions at hand with black matte finish super sporty looking polycarbonate bezel and soft silicone straps with a design inspired from a sports car! repelling dust and sweat for sports activities, built for performance. For wearing the Switch smart watch on different occasions, the user may purchase various chassis designs as per their liking separately as individual products thereby ensuring the consumer has the right looking watch for the right occasion. Not just that, but at half the cost of purchasing a new design watch product!      HANDS ON DEMONSTRATION VIDEO  FUNCTIONSSTYLIZE WITH 25 WATCH FACES! RECEIVE INCOMING AND MAKE OUTGOING CALLS WHEN SWITCH SMART WATCH IS BLUETOOTH CONNECTED TO YOUR PHONE QUICK GLANCE READ SMS AND ALL PHONE APP NOTIFICATION MESSAGES LIKE WHATSAPP, FACEBOOK, SKYPE, ETC. PEDOMETER TRACKING STEPS, DISTANCE AND CALORIES BURNT ALL ON YOUR WRIST GIVING STATISTICS AND STORING DATA  HEART RATE MONITOR AND BLOOD PRESSURE READING FUNCTION ANYTIME ANYWHERE SLEEP MONITOR LETS YOU TRACK SLEEP PATTERNS WITH STATISTICAL DATA IN APP LISTEN TO YOUR QUICK CUSTOM PLAYLIST OF 100+ SONGS STORED IN TF CARD OF WATCH WITH ANY PAIRED BLUETOOTH HEADPHONES AND GO FOR A RUN OR SIMPLY PLAY MUSIC ON WATCH SPEAKER BLUETOOTH CONNECTED TO YOUR PHONE TALK TO SIRI OR GOOGLE ON YOUR WATCH WHEN BLUETOOTH CONNECTED TO YOUR PHONE, ASK TODAY'S WEATHER, NEWS, SPORTS OR ANY QUESTION IN YOUR MIND TO YOUR PERSONAL ASSISTANT ON YOUR WRIST MOUNT YOUR PHONE ON A TRIPOD OR SIMPLY LEAN IT AGAINST THE WALL AND REMOTE CAPTURE PHOTOS FROM YOUR WATCH  7 DAYS BATTERY LIFE ON SINGLE CHARGE IP65 RATING RESISTANT TO DUST, SWEAT AND WATER SPLASH PROVIDING PROTECTION TO DEVICE FROM EXTERNAL FACTORS   What is Karacus, what's the message and what makes it unique?""Bold"", ""innovative"", ""enterprising"" & ""determined"" were the main traits we wanted in a brand name symbolizing what we stand for.

<p>We welcome you on the page of our innovative idea of ​​a startup: accessories and clothes with elements from movies and comics known to all of us! I hope you will be interested in our project and our story will seem to you quite interesting.</p>
<p>This idea belongs to two friends living in the country of nomads - Kazakhstan. We love our country very much and proud to present our idea on the global platform through the site <a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.indiegogo.com</a>. Our names are Damir and Darkhan, two friends whose friendship began from the university. We work in different areas, for example, I (Damir) work in the IT sphere, and Darkhan, in turn, worked in the cinema field for a long time and is now mastering the heights in the field of digital marketing. This encouraged us to use our skills as an advantage for the emergence of an idea, which we will try to tell you:</p>
<p>For your attention, we present clothing accessories (in the future it will be completely clothing itself) with the logos of characters from movies, TV shows, comics and all that we are interested in. Surely everyone knows the TV series ""Game of Thrones"", many admire the idea of ​​the series and all over the world millions of fans love this one. Why not buy a piece of 'Game of thrones'' as a stylish and fashionable tie clip (for your attention, we present a clip with a sign of the House).</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1538494206/hhbqlqiywe9u8bzt4vmx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The same can be said about the films studios of Marvel and DC. Many would be pleased to get a piece of the heroes of these comics as a gift. Then the plans are to launch a line of bags, hats and covers for your phone with logos and badges of the films. We also plan to start working with corporate clients, making accessories for them with the logos of their companies.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1538494239/aehn9ew41tufl63rvry1.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our project takes into account all segments of the population and gender equality between people. Namely:</p>
<p>- Prices for accessories will be very affordable and our products will be able to buy each as a gift for their second half, for friends and relatives.</p>
<p>- Accessories will be designed for both men (in the form of clips, cufflinks, belts), and for women (brooch, hairpins, etc.).</p>
<p>We bring to your attention a brooch for women's clothing in the shape of the sign ""Super Women"".</p>

<p>A distinctive feature of our startup is that we put all our soul into the project, making these accessories really stylish, unusual, interesting (without violating copyrights). It seems to us that now everyone would want one accessory with a sign of their favorite character from a movie or TV series. No question, we will do it. We have so many ideas and potential that need a good start, a good capital that will make our fantasy a reality (yes, we believe in a miracle) .. Unfortunately, in our country, startups are not developing as efficiently as I would like, therefore, it is very difficult to find like-minded people, support, which pushed us, ordinary guys from Kazakhstan, to launch our project and show it to the whole world. And why not?</p>
<p>Our line of accessories will be called “Kiyal” (brand from nomads). The idea of ​​the name is very simple: the word Kiyal from our native Kazakh language translates as Fantasy, a dream. Because that is what we want to realize, our idea, our imagination to turn it into our life. And of course, we express great patriotism towards our country, which has a long history and is home to nomads. Therefore, our brand will be represented by us, the Kiyal team, who were born and live in the homeland of the original nomads.</p>

<p>At the initial stage, we are planning to collect $ 10,000, for a good start with a very large circulation of accessories (we will give all the products a set of any of the products absolutely free of charge for the first circulation) to all those who donate and believe in our idea. And also write in the comments your opinions, feedback, ideas (for us, every opinion is important). Our plans are very ambitious, manufacturers are waiting for our answer and after collecting the required amount, we immediately launch the sale of our line of accessories to the entire world market. The whole process will take 2-3 months taking into account all the formalities and quality check of products. We truly believe that we can achieve our goals, because together we are stronger. </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Story</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Hi, my name is Cammie and I would like to introduce to you, Bundié Fit!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Bundié Fit began when I was on the lookout for new workout apparel. I am somebody who spends a lot of time in activewear, as I am a college student and it is the most comfortable type of clothing to wear on a day-to-day basis. I am able to sit in my two hour classes comfortably, go workout in them once my classes are over, and lounge in them at home when my day ends. Being that I'm in my activewear nearly all day, I wanted to make sure that whatever I bought was high end; however, being a college student didn't give me a lot of spending power to do so. After searching endlessly, all I found were basic workout leggings priced at upwards of $100; I was blown away. I thought to myself, ""There has to be a company that offers exactly what I'm looking for."" That is when Bundié Fit was born.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">⌯</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">About</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Bundié Fit (pronounced BUN-DEE-AY FIT) is a women's athleisure wear company that specializes in high quality, simplistic, affordable clothing. Athleisure wear is a category of clothing that combines the functionality of activewear, with the comfort of everyday apparel. It is a perfect option for those who are always running errands, working out, lounging at home, or are just needing something versatile and comfortable to go about their day in.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Currently, we are in the prototype stage of production. This means that we only have the samples of the items and are awaiting the next move into bulk production. With the help of our backers, we will be able to make that next move and get Bundié Fit up and running.</p>

</div></div>","The Story
Hi, my name is Cammie and I would like to introduce to you, Bundié Fit!
Bundié Fit began when I was on the lookout for new workout apparel. I am somebody who spends a lot of time in activewear, as I am a college student and it is the most comfortable type of clothing to wear on a day-to-day basis. I am able to sit in my two hour classes comfortably, go workout in them once my classes are over, and lounge in them at home when my day ends. Being that I'm in my activewear nearly all day, I wanted to make sure that whatever I bought was high end; however, being a college student didn't give me a lot of spending power to do so. After searching endlessly, all I found were basic workout leggings priced at upwards of $100; I was blown away. I thought to myself, ""There has to be a company that offers exactly what I'm looking for."" That is when Bundié Fit was born.
⌯
About
Bundié Fit (pronounced BUN-DEE-AY FIT) is a women's athleisure wear company that specializes in high quality, simplistic, affordable clothing. Athleisure wear is a category of clothing that combines the functionality of activewear, with the comfort of everyday apparel. It is a perfect option for those who are always running errands, working out, lounging at home, or are just needing something versatile and comfortable to go about their day in.
Currently, we are in the prototype stage of production. This means that we only have the samples of the items and are awaiting the next move into bulk production. With the help of our backers, we will be able to make that next move and get Bundié Fit up and running.
⌯
The Collection






Both the sports bras and the leggings can be worn for low, medium, and high impact activities. This means that they will be great for yoga, sprinting, and everything in between.
Color Options Available at Launch

For the first collection, I wanted to start with four staple colors, black, white, navy, and light heather grey. These are all colors that can be interchanged with one another and mixed-and-matched to create different outfits. Because they are staple colors, they are great to pair with complementary colors to better fit your wardrobe.
Other color options will be available in future collections.
The Material
Both the sports bras and leggings are made out of the same material. It is a nylon-spandex blend that is soft and extremely stretchy. The softness ensures extra comfort when wearing either item and the stretch factor allows each size to fit multiple body shapes.
I also wanted to make sure that the items, specifically the leggings, were not see-through. I did this by increasing the weight of the fabric making it thicker and more opaque. However, I didn't want to make the material too thick because I wanted to keep the items light and breathable.
The material is also not shiny. Typically with activewear, the material will have a sheen due to the high percent of stretch material in it. Even though we have a good amount of elasticity in our sports bras and leggings, our material is matte, making it perfect for any kind of outfit.
Details

The sports bra has a deep, square neckline. It is at a perfect length where it is not too low and is flattering on every chest size.
⟡

The sports bra is in a racerback style. It has our ""B"" logo embroidered on the top-center of the racerback in matching stitching, which allows it to blend in easily with the material, yet still be noticeable.
⟡

All sports bras come with removable padding. This padding is made to be comfortable when worn. It is just the right thickness to where it gives a bit more coverage without creating an odd bump.
⟡

The leggings have a slight ""V"" style stitching on the back that helps to accentuate shape. It also has the ""B"" logo embroidered on the center-back of the waistband.
⟡

Both the sports bra and leggings do not have elastic bands, which allows them to lay completely flat against the skin without having that ""too tight"" feeling.
Sizes
All of the items come in four sizes, X-Small, Small, Medium, and Large. Below is a corresponding size chart for your reference.

Cost
The sports bras will retail for $30 each and the leggings will retail for $45 each.

It remained an idea until a couple of years ago, when I finally decided to do something about it and start my company.

It is very difficult for a small business owner to enter this industry and compete with the large companies. The cost of developing molds for components and the amount of inventory required can be a huge financial burden for a startup company ... in fact, it can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p><p>I've already invested a lot of my money in research and development, and now we need your help to launch this company! With the funds that we raise, we will be able to start the manufacturing of the molds and the components, and will also be able to pay for an initial inventory of the makeup line we are creating.</p><p> </p><p><strong>Risks and Challenges</strong></p><p>Our biggest challenge is the length of time of the manufacturing process. The molds are fabricated in China and can take up to 3 months to make. Once the molds are made, the components then take another 2 months to produce and shipping from China is another 4 to 6 weeks. Once the components arrive at the cosmetic manufacturer, we are then put in the ""queue"" to have our components filled. This ""queue"" can be another 6-8 weeks, and then having our components filled and packaged can take 2-4 weeks.</p><p>Our plan is to stagger the production so that the components are made and are being filled while the case is being manufactured. This should help prevent delays in production.</p><p>Our other challenge is the minimum quantities required by the cosmetic manufacturer. If we only get a few orders of a particular color, we still have to order the minimum quantity from the manufacturer.

As the company grows, our makeup selection will also grow based on the needs and desires of our clients.          The Makeup that we have developed is cruelty free, paraben and talc free, with no harsh chemicals. Clients will be able to select the makeup that they want to place in their case and choose from the following colors: Lipstick Colors Lip Paint Colors Lipgloss Colors Foundation Colors Eyeshadow Colors Blush Colors          left to right: Reena Gajjar, Meghan Hebel, Ryan Hebel Dr. Reena Gajjar, FounderHello Everyone! I am a Prosthodontist, Aesthetician and Entrepreneur. Throughout my career, I have owned and operated several successful businesses - a dental training company, a patient education software company, several dental practices and a skin clinic. I have always had a passion for education and facial aesthetics! I love working with people and although I have held a couple of corporate positions, I truly am an entrepreneur and I love creating something new.This concept, Minis4Me, was inspired through my skin clinic years ago, when I became aware of the issues surrounding makeup and skin health. It remained an idea until a couple of years ago, when I finally decided to do something about it and start my company. During the past two years I have spent most of my time researching, designing and developing my product, sorting out manufacturing issues, creating my business plan,  and am now ready to bring it to market ... with your help!! Meghan Hebel, Team MemberI am a Mechanical Engineer and Product Manager, who currently does product development and graphic design for Minis4Me. I am a huge advocate for creating products that have a positive impact on people’s lives and love pushing boundaries in traditional industries. What you need to know about me is that I refuse to have a normal life. I work incredibly hard, every day, to fill my life with experiences that are meaningful and impactful. Minis4Me is a revolutionary product that will change the way people use makeup - and I had to be a part of it! Ryan Hebel, Team MemberI am currently a senior at Arizona State University studying Computer Systems Engineering and Finance. I have been involved with developing Minis4Me since its inception and am extremely excited  by the idea of revolutionizing the aesthetics industry! After our successful crowdfunding campaign, I plan on continuing to work with Minis4Me in order to improve on-the-go aesthetics for millions of people. One of the biggest issues in the cosmetic industry is the expiration of makeup. Most makeup is sold in sizes too large to use up before it expires, especially considering that we all purchase multiple products and colors. Using expired makeup can cause skin irritations, eye infections and affect the health of our skin.Another big issue with makeup is wastage and lack of customization. Many cosmetics are sold in large kits with multiple colors, even though the average user may only use several of those colors.The last issue is one of portability. Most people carry their makeup around in large ""makeup bags"", which become bulky to carry. In addition, retrieving the item you want can be cumbersome and difficult.Minis 4 Me plans to address these main issues surrounding makeup. The case offers customization and portability. The small sized makeup containers and natural cosmetic line, address the issues related to skin and eye health. Cosmetics is a multi-billion dollar industry and the barrier to entry is high. It is very difficult for a small business owner to enter this industry and compete with the large companies. The cost of developing molds for components and the amount of inventory required can be a huge financial burden for a startup company ... in fact, it can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.I've already invested a lot of my money in research and development, and now we need your help to launch this company! With the funds that we raise, we will be able to start the manufacturing of the molds and the components, and will also be able to pay for an initial inventory of the makeup line we are creating. Risks and ChallengesOur biggest challenge is the length of time of the manufacturing process. The molds are fabricated in China and can take up to 3 months to make. Once the molds are made, the components then take another 2 months to produce and shipping from China is another 4 to 6 weeks. Once the components arrive at the cosmetic manufacturer, we are then put in the ""queue"" to have our components filled. This ""queue"" can be another 6-8 weeks, and then having our components filled and packaged can take 2-4 weeks.Our plan is to stagger the production so that the components are made and are being filled while the case is being manufactured. This should help prevent delays in production.Our other challenge is the minimum quantities required by the cosmetic manufacturer. If we only get a few orders of a particular color, we still have to order the minimum quantity from the manufacturer. To help avoid this, we have decided to offer a limited selection of colors (although still offering enough variety), so we are able to control the amount of inventory we will need to order.",32.0,1,"1 Campaign

If you wish to learn about the duties and taxes applicable to your shipment, you may want to check with the customs and border protection authority of your country. From our experience, we have learned that most of the countries have higher thresholds for import duties and a majority of our international customers don't get charged any additional fees apart from the regular shipping fees on Kickstarter. We will not be making money on shipping and will be transparent about these cost.RETURNSMost Kickstarter campaigns do not have return policies. Because the majority of our funds are going toward keeping the Texas Factory open, we won’t be able to accept returns (see above cost breakdown). However, we will always do size exchanges and gift cards.SIZE EXCHANGE POLICYIf you follow the sizing chart carefully, then the shirts shall fit. Still, if you wish to exchange your shirts for any reason, we’ll happily do that, just ship us back the order with the original packing slip and follow the directions on the packing slip. We’ll contact you and see what size you need. You’ll have to pay for the shipping for the new exchanged order, so it’s very important to get your sizing correct the first time. Returned items must be in its original, unused, unaltered and unwashed condition, and must be returned with original tags and packaging. All Returns are subject to inspection before they are processed. We accept exchanges up to 30 days of you receiving the shirts(s).",42.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>Our Back Story </strong></h3>
<p>My name is Lisa Cassidy and I have worked in the <strong>green sector </strong>for several decades. For as long as I can remember, I have always been recycling. I think it is because I am very practical and hate to see things wasted. And although, I have worked in several industries, I often sough out green companies.</p>
<p>When I first graduated college, my focus was on energy conservation (aka energy efficient light bulbs, smart homes), but it soon became much broader. I moved to Pratt &amp; Whitney Power Systems, where we used aircraft engines to produce efficient, portable back-up power to countries all over the world.</p>
<p>Years later, I worked with manufacturers to promote recycling products and equipment. <strong>I found it very exciting to know that businesses all over the world, like McDonald's, Starbucks, Target, the Marriott and more were using our recycling equipment to redirect millions of cardboard boxes, plastic jugs and aluminum cans out of the landfill to create new products.</strong> As you might guess, I was not the one building the recycling equipment, I was the one marketing it. <strong>Little did I know back then, that someday I would be attempting to upcycle thousands of bicycle tubes into new eco products of my own creation, yet here we are.</strong></p>
<p>What got me into upcycled bracelets began as a general interest in ecofashion. Back when I traveled a lot to trade shows and events all over the world, I became an avid collector of bags and fashion accessories made from repurposed or recycled materials. I loved to hear how they were made. I soon learned that there were a lot of people interested in fun, funky eco products and the stories behind them.</p>
<p><strong>In March 2019, I started ecoimagine™, an online boutique of over 140 fashion accessories, apparel and yoga and cycling gear made from recycled, repurposed or biodegradable materials. </strong>I worked with over a dozen small US-based businesses to amass a collection of products made from 50% or more recycled plastic, recycled flip flops, recycled polyester, recycled vinyl, recycled bicycle tubes, bamboo, cork and more.</p>
<p><strong>In June 2019, I opened a brick and mortar “micro store” in Lexington, Massachusetts. </strong>The first year was a lot of work, but it was also a great education on what people liked, didn't like and why. I learned that bracelets were by far the most popular category of my eco collection. I learned that people liked to buy eco items as gifts for hard to shop for people, Moms, girlfriends and daughters and I learned that people were much quicker to buy something for $25, then they were for $40. </p>
<p>During the winter of 2020, I started tinkering with bicycle tubes. <strong>I had learned that bicycle tubes were not recycled as much as other materials and were often sent to the landfill once they were damaged. Due to the size of bicycle tubes, I instantly saw an opportunity for bracelets. </strong>I had tried a few designs, but the curve and the thickness of bicycle tubes made cutting very challenging. I had several starts and stops before I finally figured it out.</p>
<p>By the summer of 2020, I had a lot more time to do testing and to think through solutions thanks to Covid. After several hundred attempts to create a consistent, repeatable process throughout the year, I finally found a multi-step process of heating, flattening and cutting the tubes that worked! <strong>I tested several designs on Etsy, to see which were most popular. I landed on the top 6 you see today on ecoimagine.com.</strong></p>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
<p><strong>It is estimated that there are over 1 billion bikes on the planet and no good use for the inner tubes once damaged. I have set out a goal called the “Reuse the Tube Challenge” to upcycle 500 bicycle tubes by the end of this year, 2000 by next year. </strong></p>
<p>There is no shortage of damaged tubes and shipping costs are minimal given that there are several local bike shops willing to donate.  </p>
<p><strong>Current customers love our bicycle tube bracelets because they are light, soft, waterproof and stylish. They are also affordable ranging from $22 to $27 each. I often hear that the bracelets are the coolest thing they own and that they love the attention they get when people ask about them.</strong></p>
<p>Now that I have a path to succeed, I can envision many ideas for expansion into other bracelet designs, necklaces, earrings and other types of bicycle tube products. I also want to reach out to other designers and artists, provide contests at the high school level and cross promote with other businesses. I am super excited about all the possibilities.</p>
<p>I have an MBA and over 30 years working in business. I understand what it would take to scale this business in order to have a real impact on people and the environment.  I also have a great network to tap into for additional resources. </p>
<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>The cutting process is currently the most difficult and time-consuming part of the process.  After researching several options, I have learned that <strong>GlowForge laser cutters</strong> are extremely fast and accurate and work well with rubber.</p>
<p><strong>To achieve the volume I am looking at, I would like to raise $6000 for a GlowForge Pro laser cutter.</strong>  I can manage with the GlowForge Plus at $4k, but will eventually need the Pro. My plan is to continue to invest the profits from the bracelets into upgrading/buying new equipment.</p>
<p><strong>For every person that donates, you will receive 50% OFF Retail! If you donate $25, I will send you 2 zebra bicycle tube bracelets - one regular width, one wide. If you donate $50, you will get all 4 bracelets from the Paradise Collection (Almost Paradise, Tropical Paradise, Zebra and Pure Whimsy). For $75 you will get you the full collection! Keep them or give some away as gifts. People love them.</strong></p>
<p>All bracelets are available on ecoimagine.com, my Shopify store. We use ShipStation for shipping orders. Shipping is always free.</p>
<h3><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The main challenge is time lost.</strong> As you might guess, now is prime time for preparing for the holiday season. With a laser cutter, I could reach out to thousands of retailers by email well before the holidays, knowing that I could deliver on inventory in the fall. <strong>Without a laser cutter, my outreach would have to be much more conservative.</strong></p>
<p>Also, when you sell to retailers, they generally buy at considerable discount because they are buying at a higher volume. <strong>In order to promote to retailers, you must be able to produce the bracelets at higher volumes in order to ship quickly in large quantities.</strong></p>
<p>Then there is the cost associated with giving away hundreds of free samples to retailers and influencers. This is all worth it, if you can produce higher quantities. <strong>When you can only produce a limited number, you tend to give away less which makes the product less visible to your target audience.</strong></p>
<p>I am now on my 3<sup>rd</sup> year as a retail business owner. During Covid, I worked on a market research project at Wayfair geared to 45k business owners. During that time, I learned a lot about what retailers need to succeed and strategies to sell product online. I am confident that I have the ability to do this. My goal is to do it faster.</p>
<p>If I do not raise enough funds to buy a laser printer through Indiegogo.com, I will continue to set aside a percentage of the profits I make through ecoimagine.com towards equipment. I will not be able to maximize the 2021 holiday season, but I will eventually reach my goal.</p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Tornado Shield is the world's first affordable, mobile, and puncture-resistant 
tornado protection for individuals and families.<br/>
</h3>
<h3>
</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3><b>Tornado Quick Facts</b></h3>
<ul>
<li><p>All 50 states are in danger of tornadoes</p></li>
<li><p>Over 1,275 tornadoes recorded annually since 1997</p></li>
<li><p>More than 90% of tornado victims suffer from
     lacerations</p></li>
<li><p>One Tornado Shield costs less than stitches at the
     emergency room</p></li>
<li><p>99% of tornadoes are EF0 - EF3 (wind speed of
     65-167mph)</p></li>
<li><p>Less than 1% are EF4-EF5 (wind speed of
     168-234mph)</p></li>
</ul>
<h3><b>Campaign Facts</b></h3>
<ul><li><p>If the goal is not met by October 8th, 100% of all funds will be returned to contributers and
     no perks will be delivered.<br/></p></li></ul>
<h3>How It All Began
</h3>
<p>The idea of Tuuli Armor was birthed out of the EF-5 tornado that hit 
Joplin, Missouri, on May 22, 2011.  Like many others in our neighborhood, my family and I had no where to go, so we experienced the massive storm covered only by a mattress on our hallway floor.<br/></p>
<h3>The Huge Gap</h3>
<p>In the days and months following the horrific storm, I began searching for a better way to protect my family but found the options were either too expensive or just unrealistic for our situation. As I thought about the many others in our town that weren't well-protected and the fact that the majority of tornado related injuries are lacerations, I knew I needed a small, affordable, and highly puncture-resistant design.</p>
<p>Months of research led me to ballistic nylon, which was invented by the 
military to protect soldiers
from flying shrapnel. Using a pressurized air cannon, I conducted 
numerous tests (see more details below) with various fabrics and projectiles made of wood, metal,
 and glass. In one test, a metal projectile that penetrated three 1/2"" pieces of plywood did not puncture the layers of ballistic
 nylon and padding now used in the Tornado Shield.</p>
<p>Implementing feedback from two product reviews with professionals from a
 wide range of disciplines refined it into the final product you see 
today.<br/></p>

<h3>The Goal</h3>
<p>The Tornado Shield campaign is using the fixed funding model because we actually need $105,000 to start production.  To purchase the custom red/orange ballistic nylon, the minimum order is 1,000 yards, which requires a significant investment of capital - and that's just one of the materials!</p>
<p><b>YOU have a part to play</b> - whether it's giving $5 or $5,000 - to help make this layer of protection available.  Would you join the team and celebrate with us as this dream becomes a reality? <br/></p>

<h3>Testing Method and Results</h3>
</div><div>
<h4>
Method</h4>Tests on the Tornado Shield were modeled after the National Institute of Justice's standard for testing bullet-proof vests. This test uses a clay back plate to simulate impact against the human body. A 3-inch deep clay block was made as the back plate for the testing. The fabric was laid over the clay to simulate the Tornado Shield laying over a person’s body. An air canon was used to shoot differing projectiles at the fabric at point blank range. The projectiles were shot perpendicular to the fabric and clay target, which were propped against a firm backing. <br/><br/><h4>Speed</h4>The standard test for a safe room includes shooting a 15-pound 
wooden 2x4 at 150 miles per hour.  Most Tornado Shield tests were performed with lighter objects but at speeds of 200-260 miles per hour.<br/><br/><h4>Projectiles</h4>The projectiles used in testing were made of glass, wood, and steel to simulate construction debris.  Each type of projectile was tested at different weights, but the highlights are listed here: <br/><br/><b>Wood:</b>  A ¼-pound spike made from a 1.3 inch diameter wood rod sharpened to a point and launched at 200 miles per hour did not penetrate the Tornado Shield.<br/><br/><b>Metal Rod:</b>  A 5-ounce, 3/8-inch round steel rod (simulating rebar) launched at 260 miles per hour did not penetrate the Tornado Shield but did penetrate a wooden 2x6 as well as 1.4 inches of plywood. <br/><br/><b>Glass Pieces:</b>  A 3-ounce projectile with glass affixed to the tip (simulating a 25-square-inch sheet of glass) launched at 200 miles per hour caused a small prick in the Tornado Shield when struck at a perpendicular angle. <br/><br/><b>Glass Fragments: </b> Small glass fragments and safety glass did not penetrate the Tornado Shield when launched at 200 miles per hour. <br/><br/><h3>Press and Publicity</h3>

Tornado Quick Facts

All 50 states are in danger of tornadoes
Over 1,275 tornadoes recorded annually since 1997
More than 90% of tornado victims suffer from
     lacerations
One Tornado Shield costs less than stitches at the
     emergency room
99% of tornadoes are EF0 - EF3 (wind speed of
     65-167mph)
Less than 1% are EF4-EF5 (wind speed of
     168-234mph)

Campaign Facts
If the goal is not met by October 8th, 100% of all funds will be returned to contributers and
     no perks will be delivered.
How It All Began

The idea of Tuuli Armor was birthed out of the EF-5 tornado that hit 
Joplin, Missouri, on May 22, 2011.  Like many others in our neighborhood, my family and I had no where to go, so we experienced the massive storm covered only by a mattress on our hallway floor.
The Huge Gap
In the days and months following the horrific storm, I began searching for a better way to protect my family but found the options were either too expensive or just unrealistic for our situation. As I thought about the many others in our town that weren't well-protected and the fact that the majority of tornado related injuries are lacerations, I knew I needed a small, affordable, and highly puncture-resistant design.
Months of research led me to ballistic nylon, which was invented by the 
military to protect soldiers
from flying shrapnel. Using a pressurized air cannon, I conducted 
numerous tests (see more details below) with various fabrics and projectiles made of wood, metal,
 and glass. In one test, a metal projectile that penetrated three 1/2"" pieces of plywood did not puncture the layers of ballistic
 nylon and padding now used in the Tornado Shield.
Implementing feedback from two product reviews with professionals from a
 wide range of disciplines refined it into the final product you see 
today.

Where To Use It:  Everywhere Safe Rooms Are Not




The Goal
The Tornado Shield campaign is using the fixed funding model because we actually need $105,000 to start production.  To purchase the custom red/orange ballistic nylon, the minimum order is 1,000 yards, which requires a significant investment of capital - and that's just one of the materials!
YOU have a part to play - whether it's giving $5 or $5,000 - to help make this layer of protection available.  Would you join the team and celebrate with us as this dream becomes a reality?

Tornado Related Injuries






On average in the US, tornadoes cause 70 fatalities and 1,500 injuries each year (http://www.noaawatch.gov/themes/severe.php).
Soft-tissue wounds are among the most common tornado related injuries, and they are often contaminated with debris and bacteria and require irrigation and delayed closure (Bohonos, J. J., and D. E. Hogan, 1998: The medical impact of tornadoes in North America. J. Emerg. Med., 17, 67–73.; Brenner, S. A., and E. K. Noji, 1992: Wound infections after tornadoes. J. Trauma, 33, 673.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9950391).

Most of the injured have multiple wounds, many of which are in areas of exposed skin like the neck and head.  The skin exhibits a characteristic abrasion pattern due to fine particles of sand, mud, soil, and even water traveling at highly accelerated speeds (March, Gerard, 2002: Natural Disasters and the Impacts on Health, 5.  www.eird.org/isdr.../Natural%20disasters%20and%20the%20impacts.pdf).

Testing Method and Results


MethodTests on the Tornado Shield were modeled after the National Institute of Justice's standard for testing bullet-proof vests. This test uses a clay back plate to simulate impact against the human body. A 3-inch deep clay block was made as the back plate for the testing. The fabric was laid over the clay to simulate the Tornado Shield laying over a person’s body. An air canon was used to shoot differing projectiles at the fabric at point blank range. The projectiles were shot perpendicular to the fabric and clay target, which were propped against a firm backing. SpeedThe standard test for a safe room includes shooting a 15-pound 
wooden 2x4 at 150 miles per hour.  Most Tornado Shield tests were performed with lighter objects but at speeds of 200-260 miles per hour.ProjectilesThe projectiles used in testing were made of glass, wood, and steel to simulate construction debris.  Each type of projectile was tested at different weights, but the highlights are listed here: Wood:  A ¼-pound spike made from a 1.3 inch diameter wood rod sharpened to a point and launched at 200 miles per hour did not penetrate the Tornado Shield.Metal Rod:  A 5-ounce, 3/8-inch round steel rod (simulating rebar) launched at 260 miles per hour did not penetrate the Tornado Shield but did penetrate a wooden 2x6 as well as 1.4 inches of plywood. Glass Pieces:  A 3-ounce projectile with glass affixed to the tip (simulating a 25-square-inch sheet of glass) launched at 200 miles per hour caused a small prick in the Tornado Shield when struck at a perpendicular angle. Glass Fragments:  Small glass fragments and safety glass did not penetrate the Tornado Shield when launched at 200 miles per hour. Press and Publicity

<h3>
Why now?</h3>I have been researching plastic potty manufacturing for several
years, since the clear potty I had been selling was discontinued.
 Only recently did all the pieces come together in a way that
I'm confident about both the process and the product.  By
having the potties made with a vacuum-molding process, I'm keeping
the tooling costs low (about 1/4 the cost of any other
manufacturing process I've researched).  I'm also really
excited about having the factory so close to home.  It's not

<h2 align=""left"">MoreSun™ is the world's first and only solar coating that
can be applied in the field to operational solar panels, increasing efficiency by reducing reflection losses. </h2>
<p align=""left"">  </p>
<h3 align=""left""><b>Generate Solar Power</b></h3>
<div align=""left"">Currently there are 320 million installed solar panels world-wide that need to be upgraded
to increase panel efficiency and reduce reflection losses. Upgrading all of them with MoreSun coating will generate 3.2 gigawatts of new solar power.<br/><br/><p>We have demonstrated the 
performance of our MoreSun coating -- for ease of application, 
efficiency, and robustness -- on our pilot arrays in Corvallis, Oregon. 
 Of the four panels shown below, you can tell which is the uncoated 
panel (for testing comparison) because
it reflects the blue sky -- lost photons! 
The three panels with our MoreSun coating appear darker as they more efficiently soak up the energy of the sun.<br/></p>
<br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/731464/files/20140720162100-solar_panels_picture_w-wo_moresun.png?1405898460"" src="""" style='width: 620px; height: 439px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: ""Benton Sans"",Helvetica,sans-serif;'/><br/></p>
</div>
<p align=""left"">The graph below shows MoreSun coating's performance data over 25 days
 of cloudy and sunny Oregon weather. During this time, our MoreSun 
coating survived rain, frost, hail, and wind.  The 4% average increase 
represents about ten watts per panel. Ten watts per panel multiplied by 
the 320,000,000 uncoated panels world-wide generates 3.2 gigawatts of 
new solar power. (Note: ARC refers to Anti-Reflective Coating, the 
technical term for MoreSun coating). <br/></p>

<b>Save Birds</b>
</h3>
<p>In addition to reduced efficiency, uncoated panels also pose a
threat to birds.<span>  The reflected sunlight
off the uncoated panels can confuse birds by looking like a body of water.  When the birds try and land on the panels, they can be injured or stranded, then die. Tragically, such waterfowl as Grebes,
Cormorants, and Coots, have fallen victim at large solar
facilities in the United States (</span><a href=""http://www.kcet.org/news/rewire/Avian-mortality%20Report%20FINALclean.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Avian Mortality at Solar Facilities</a>).<br/></p>

<br/><p>Birds mistake the uncoated panels for water because the
light the panels reflect is polarized (See<b> Polarized Light Pollution</b><span> below).
Water naturally polarizes light and if you have ever been to the lake or
ocean on a sunny day, you have seen this phenomenon.  Polarized light is the glare that causes you
to reach for your sunglasses.</span></p>

<p>Many birds, insects, and other animals use polarized light to identify water, as well as, for

Therefore, polarized light produced by solar panels may be confused for natural polarized light and attract or confuse dispersing and migrating individuals, and may reduce successful plant reproduction on the proposed project site by confusing and disorienting pollinators (see <a href=""http://www.cosb.us/Solargen/deir/c06_biology.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Panoche Valley Solar Farm Report</a>).<br/><br/>

</div></div>","MoreSun™ is the world's first and only solar coating that
can be applied in the field to operational solar panels, increasing efficiency by reducing reflection losses. 
  
Generate Solar Power
Currently there are 320 million installed solar panels world-wide that need to be upgraded
to increase panel efficiency and reduce reflection losses. Upgrading all of them with MoreSun coating will generate 3.2 gigawatts of new solar power.We have demonstrated the 
performance of our MoreSun coating -- for ease of application, 
efficiency, and robustness -- on our pilot arrays in Corvallis, Oregon. 
 Of the four panels shown below, you can tell which is the uncoated 
panel (for testing comparison) because
it reflects the blue sky -- lost photons! 
The three panels with our MoreSun coating appear darker as they more efficiently soak up the energy of the sun.


The graph below shows MoreSun coating's performance data over 25 days
 of cloudy and sunny Oregon weather. During this time, our MoreSun 
coating survived rain, frost, hail, and wind.  The 4% average increase 
represents about ten watts per panel. Ten watts per panel multiplied by 
the 320,000,000 uncoated panels world-wide generates 3.2 gigawatts of 
new solar power. (Note: ARC refers to Anti-Reflective Coating, the 
technical term for MoreSun coating). 



Enhancement of Solar Panels with MoreSun Coating



Daily Energy Gain (%) in Various Weather Conditions



Displace CO2
The 3.2 gigawatts of new solar power generated by MoreSun coating will displace the production of 72 million tons of CO2 from fossil fuel power plants over the next 20 years or 3.6 million tons/yr.



Save Birds

In addition to reduced efficiency, uncoated panels also pose a
threat to birds.  The reflected sunlight
off the uncoated panels can confuse birds by looking like a body of water.  When the birds try and land on the panels, they can be injured or stranded, then die. Tragically, such waterfowl as Grebes,
Cormorants, and Coots, have fallen victim at large solar
facilities in the United States (Avian Mortality at Solar Facilities).

Birds mistake the uncoated panels for water because the
light the panels reflect is polarized (See Polarized Light Pollution below).
Water naturally polarizes light and if you have ever been to the lake or
ocean on a sunny day, you have seen this phenomenon.  Polarized light is the glare that causes you
to reach for your sunglasses.
 
Many birds, insects, and other animals use polarized light to identify water, as well as, for
general navigation.  MoreSun
coating has been documented to reduce the amount of reflected polarized light from panels to the amount naturally reflected by the ground.  This will allow birds to fly over solar arrays without confusion.

Once we demonstrate that anti-reflective coatings mitigate bird losses at solar arrays, the US Fish and Wildlife Service may require all solar arrays to have anti-reflective coatings under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (MBTA). The European Union has a similar protection act, the Birds Directive, which may require similar mandates. Requiring anti-reflective coatings on all solar panel arrays has the potential to save birds on an international scale.

<h1>BECAUSE...</h1>
<p>- We were truly surprised to learn that there are no ""travel"" clothing brands making their products in the USA. </p>
<p>- They say that it would cost too much to make jackets with tons of features in the USA because the American Factories are not set up properly. </p>
<p>- We want to disrupt the logic behind this theory. We made our samples here and the outcome is top notch. Our factory is fired up for the opportunity to make such a high quality travel jacket. </p>
<p>- We don't want you to pack another jacket for your next trip. The Aviator Travel Jacket will take you through your journey with function, comfort, and style.</p>

</div></div>","THE AVIATOR TRAVEL JACKET IS...


 

1. The only premium travel jacket made in the USA. We use the finest fabric and trims, and cut and sew in our Los Angeles factory. 
2. Backed by a lifetime guarantee. We are not a ""fast fashion"" brand. Our belief is, If you're investing in our products we are not going to let you down. 
3. Loaded with features for traveling and for everyday use. Each style has features that anyone would want or need for traveling the world or for staying local.
BECAUSE...
- We were truly surprised to learn that there are no ""travel"" clothing brands making their products in the USA. 
- They say that it would cost too much to make jackets with tons of features in the USA because the American Factories are not set up properly. 
- We want to disrupt the logic behind this theory. We made our samples here and the outcome is top notch. Our factory is fired up for the opportunity to make such a high quality travel jacket. 
- We don't want you to pack another jacket for your next trip. The Aviator Travel Jacket will take you through your journey with function, comfort, and style.

HANDS-FREE HOODIE IS...

- You should look and feel confident that you're ready for what's next.
- Todays world is full of technology, and we want you to stay in control.
- We know America can make premium products at a fair price.
- You're covered by our lifetime guarantee. See below...

<p>Over 5 years of relentless hard work and progress has led us to this moment. With your help, we can further push the boundaries of CaptoGlove and fund new features and capabilities. </p>
<p>By getting the Captoglove months before retail consumers, you can help shape future development by providing real-world feedback. We saw this first hand at the CES and GDC trade shows as others instantly imagined new uses: “teaching sign language”, “creating a virtual keyboard”, “learning to play the piano”, “game controls for the limited mobility people”, “3D image control” – the list goes on and on!  </p>
<div style=""text-align: center;""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/En0Gm__EqJM?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p>Our backers will have the possibility to exchange their configuration of CaptoGlove and benefit from others’ configurations and usage on a specific Capto cloud. A community of users will exchange best practice, lead new features to be implemented and shape development.<br/> </p>
<p>It’s been said that necessity is the mother of invention, and CaptoGlove is no exception. In 2011 our inventor’s father suffered a stroke and lost the use of several body’s part. </p>
<p>After studying an advanced recovery method called “Motor Re-learning” in which movements such as bending and pushing were measured using “dumb objects”, the concept for CaptoGlove was born. He then created the first prototype of a glove fitted with sensors that connected to a PC, which provided a new quantifiable way to measure the recovery process. </p>
<p>CaptoGlove rapidly enhanced his training sessions and the rehabilitation was a huge success. </p>

</div></div>","Over 5 years of relentless hard work and progress has led us to this moment. With your help, we can further push the boundaries of CaptoGlove and fund new features and capabilities. 
By getting the Captoglove months before retail consumers, you can help shape future development by providing real-world feedback. We saw this first hand at the CES and GDC trade shows as others instantly imagined new uses: “teaching sign language”, “creating a virtual keyboard”, “learning to play the piano”, “game controls for the limited mobility people”, “3D image control” – the list goes on and on!  

 
Our backers will have the possibility to exchange their configuration of CaptoGlove and benefit from others’ configurations and usage on a specific Capto cloud. A community of users will exchange best practice, lead new features to be implemented and shape development. 
It’s been said that necessity is the mother of invention, and CaptoGlove is no exception. In 2011 our inventor’s father suffered a stroke and lost the use of several body’s part. 
After studying an advanced recovery method called “Motor Re-learning” in which movements such as bending and pushing were measured using “dumb objects”, the concept for CaptoGlove was born. He then created the first prototype of a glove fitted with sensors that connected to a PC, which provided a new quantifiable way to measure the recovery process. 
CaptoGlove rapidly enhanced his training sessions and the rehabilitation was a huge success. 


 

 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 

As a wearable motion controller for video games, CaptoGlove delivers a unique and immersive experience on a wide variety of platforms and genres including first person shooters, ﬂight sims, virtual reality, augmented reality, mobile games and more!

PC Gaming

Compatible with all past, present, and future PC games right out of the box;
Use intuitive hand gestures to replace keyboard, mouse, and peripheral functions;
Fully customize one or a pair of CaptoGloves to control a wide variety of different inputs;
Download pre-set configuration profiles for immediate use or create your personal one;
More immersive, improves response time and adds unparalleled realism.

One CaptoGlove provides plenty of flexibility for most games. Generally, a right hand glove is preferred since it is the hand that controls the mouse for most players.


 


With a pair of CaptoGloves, players can leverage the use of both hands to obtain maximum flexibility. For example, in this DCS World 2 video, the player is using one hand to control the helicopter and the other to interact with cockpit switches.

 
Virtual & Augmented Reality

Compatible with all existing VR headsets, including Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, Samsung Gear VR, Google Cardboard and more;
Delivers new level of realism and immersion to VR & AR applications;
Supports use of additional ‘CaptoSensors’ for more advanced positional tracking of arms and hands;
CaptoGlove has been selected by HTC Vive for integration with the Vive Tracker delivering even more versatility to CaptoGlove!



 
Mobile Gaming  

Compatible with all iOS & Android smartphones and tablets;
Works with any mobile game that supports a game pad;
Will also control non-gaming functions such as making phone calls, etc.

Under Development - Bluetooth Gaming Consoles
 

CaptoGlove is immediately usable because it connects directly to the hardware it is controlling. No extra devices needed. It connects wirelessly and interprets natural hand movements as control gestures for a true plug & play experience.

offered the ultimate in forward-thinking footwear. It was from this 
thought, that HeavyTaste was born.  </p><p>We also wanted to celebrate

prominent Australian streets, in the design phase of our shoes.

produce handmade shoes, using genuine leather. Mind you, we were 
surprised by how skilled these artisans were. We combined traditional 
skills with technology to reinforce our shoes with trademarked padding

What we wanted was a truly functional footwear that comes without a loss

Stretch goals will be introduced once our priority goal is reached.**IMPORTANT : All 2nd generation Street Slips will ship free worldwide, regardless of amount pledged. For lower category perks, all Australians orders will also ship for free. For international orders, please add AUD7 for socks and AUD35 for 1st gen shoes. Shipping charges for international shipping is flat, regardless of the order quantity. In 2012, two friends and I grew frustrated by the lack of functional 
innovation, which was being showcased in the footwear industry. It 
seemed as though we all just got used to getting blisters, repetitive 
styles, and ill-fitting shoes. Our aim was to create a brand which 
offered the ultimate in forward-thinking footwear. It was from this 
thought, that HeavyTaste was born.  We also wanted to celebrate 
Australia in our products, which is why we took inspiration from 
prominent Australian streets, in the design phase of our shoes.

What we have created is the Street Slip.We work with smaller disadvantaged manufacturers to design and 
produce handmade shoes, using genuine leather. Mind you, we were 
surprised by how skilled these artisans were. We combined traditional 
skills with technology to reinforce our shoes with trademarked padding 
for comfort, and incorporating styles fit for both males and females. 
What we wanted was a truly functional footwear that comes without a loss
 of aesthetics.A Few Words From The Artisan.True innovation lies in the simplest of ideas. Our simple idea –change the cut of our shoes.                                     Jump to:

FAQsBy 2013, with a year of meticulous research and development, we were 
able to create a shoe cut unique to HeavyTaste. No other brand in the 
world has such a cut, as we developed a unique last which allows us to 
produce the ultimate slip-on style shoe.Unlike oxford and brogues, the Street Slip’s ease of wear allows the wearer to put them on in a matter of seconds.Unlike loafers, the cut allows the shoe to mould to the wearers’ feet to ensure a strong hold, and no slippage.Our choice of materials have allowed for our slip, after a few wears, to mould like a glove to the wearer’s feet!The Perfect Couple.We
 have worked hard and long to make our slips genderless. If you are 
looking for a pair of trendy and comfortable kicks that would work great
 alone or even better in couples, then look no further!                                    Jump to:

<p>WHY TAKE ON THE NIGHTDRESS?</p>
<p>If like me you love stylish, feminine and modern sleepwear - good luck finding good options at reasonable prices in sleepwear departments. I have literally searched everywhere.</p>
<p>When I got pregnant my desire for great sleep &amp; loungewear became even stronger. As women we go through so many different stages in our lives when being comfortable is a number one priority. But why should comfortable mean boring or unflattering?</p>
<p>When I searched the market I could not find ANYONE making nightdresses or sleepwear that was remotely interesting to me or to any of the women I know. </p>
<p>I started to think about how many women who could truly benefit from better designed sleep and loungewear made with super comfortable performance fabrics, including pregnant women, women in maternity leave, women who work from home and stay at home mums. </p>
<p>This is when I decided that I wanted to make lounge and sleepwear, starting with beautiful nightdresses, for myself and every other modern woman out there wanting a better option than what is available in this category today.</p>

<p>ABOUT ME</p>
<p>My name is Anette Miwa Dimmen and I currently reside in Oslo, Norway. Having worked over 7 years in an international creative agency as a partner and consultant, I´m used to overseeing branding, design, product development and manufacturing processes. Over the years I have been in charge of creating products as diverse as homeware, personal accessories, stationary, hair &amp; skincare, scented candles, jewellery and clothing for several private label clients. In fact, it was one of my most recent projects developing a line of active wear for a large cruise liner, that opened up my eyes to the amazing qualities of natural performance fabrics. </p>

<p>COLLECTION</p>
<p>Our collection of five simple, flattering Nordic dress designs will make you feel comfortable, beautiful and effortlessly stylish - day and night.</p>
<p>COMFORT &amp; EASY CARE</p>
<p>We use sustainable technical fabrics that are moisture wicking, highly breathable, crease and odour resistant - and machine washable. These easy to care for garments perfectly compliment busy, contemporary lifestyles reflecting women As We Are Now. </p>

<p>STYLE</p>
<p>AW:AN dresses are both timeless and current. They don´t look at all like traditional sleepwear but rather like your favourite daywear dresses. The designs will flatter most body shapes, and are the perfect merger between sustainable technical fibers and Nordic minimalistic fashion aesthetics - in a product category ripe for modernisation.</p>

<p>NOTE: Bust, waist &amp; hip sizes are 1/2 sizes. For size incl. front and back you need to x2 :)</p>

</div></div>","WHY TAKE ON THE NIGHTDRESS?
If like me you love stylish, feminine and modern sleepwear - good luck finding good options at reasonable prices in sleepwear departments. I have literally searched everywhere.
When I got pregnant my desire for great sleep & loungewear became even stronger. As women we go through so many different stages in our lives when being comfortable is a number one priority. But why should comfortable mean boring or unflattering?
When I searched the market I could not find ANYONE making nightdresses or sleepwear that was remotely interesting to me or to any of the women I know. 
I started to think about how many women who could truly benefit from better designed sleep and loungewear made with super comfortable performance fabrics, including pregnant women, women in maternity leave, women who work from home and stay at home mums. 
This is when I decided that I wanted to make lounge and sleepwear, starting with beautiful nightdresses, for myself and every other modern woman out there wanting a better option than what is available in this category today.

ABOUT ME
My name is Anette Miwa Dimmen and I currently reside in Oslo, Norway. Having worked over 7 years in an international creative agency as a partner and consultant, I´m used to overseeing branding, design, product development and manufacturing processes. Over the years I have been in charge of creating products as diverse as homeware, personal accessories, stationary, hair & skincare, scented candles, jewellery and clothing for several private label clients. In fact, it was one of my most recent projects developing a line of active wear for a large cruise liner, that opened up my eyes to the amazing qualities of natural performance fabrics. 

COLLECTION
Our collection of five simple, flattering Nordic dress designs will make you feel comfortable, beautiful and effortlessly stylish - day and night.
COMFORT & EASY CARE
We use sustainable technical fabrics that are moisture wicking, highly breathable, crease and odour resistant - and machine washable. These easy to care for garments perfectly compliment busy, contemporary lifestyles reflecting women As We Are Now. 

STYLE
AW:AN dresses are both timeless and current. They don´t look at all like traditional sleepwear but rather like your favourite daywear dresses. The designs will flatter most body shapes, and are the perfect merger between sustainable technical fibers and Nordic minimalistic fashion aesthetics - in a product category ripe for modernisation.








 
SIZING
What size should you choose? AW:AN dresses follow standard European size charts. In other words your normal size applies. And should you  happen to choose a wrong size, there is a very good chance the dress will fit you perfectly anyway, as all of our styles are made in soft, non clingy knitted jersey fabrics that are easy to fit.
NOTE: Bust, waist & hip sizes are 1/2 sizes. For size incl. front and back you need to x2 :)

WE´VE GOT YOUR SHIPPING FEES COVERED! 
But backers from some countries may have to pay additional import duties and other applicable taxes to the concerned authorities upon receipt of their goods, based on the import policies of their respective countries.

From our experience, we have learned that most of the countries have higher thresholds for import duties and a majority of our international customers don't get charged any additional fees.

<p><b>The JUST WaLLET story</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>It all started in September 2013. My wife asked me what I wanted for Christmas. It got me thinking about what I really needed. And I realized that my biggest wish was to solve the never-ending problem of my smart phone’s low battery life. So I started looking for different ways of solving that, but I didn’t succeed, because all the devices I found had an extra thing I had to buy and carry around with me and it took up too much space. Also, if I would forget to bring those things with me, I was screwed. And that bugged me. So I looked into my pockets and tried to figure out which one of the things I had with me could charge my phone. In my pockets there was nothing but a wallet. And than it hit me. I searched the internet for a wallet that could charge my phone. But unfortunately, I didn’t find anything. So I asked my friends around the world to help me find such thing. But of course, they didn’t find anything either. So I decided to create my own wallet and find out if there were any other people who had the same problem as me. I also did surveys and read questionnnaires. And that made me realize that this is the thing people all around the world hate the most. And so JUST WaLLET was created. From now on everybody can get one!  </p>

A copy of a phone, watch, purse, dress, etc. Even luxury items are made in hundreds or thousands of copies. With all the technological advancements of our time, there is no way to have a unique product; you have to share it with millions of people. Not anymore! SecretBrand* changes that with your support. We desire to build a webshop where you can design your dresses and create your artwork <strong>or pick one from our designers/artist's collections. </strong></p><p><strong>SecretBrand * it's a startup about fashion, technology, marketing, branding, software, art and e-commerce.</strong></p><p>We invested three years in solving this problem, and now we have the ideal solution. We are ready to implement the project.</p><p>After the research and market study were completed, a brand new user-friendly wireframe artwork editor was born. After we did the research, studied the market, and avoided unwanted influences we have created a friendly wireframe editor. This editor will be the core of our posh webshop experience and the central spot where you can buy a dress, a blouse, a skirt, a scarf or just design your own artwork. We use only high-quality materials certified for printing just to be sure that your unique artwork will look great and stand the test of time. (M.H.B.B)</p><p><strong>You know it's posh because:</strong></p><p>The artworks made by our designers took six months to complete. The finished product is manufactured exclusively <strong>for you and you alone.</strong><br/><br/>- The amount of work put in by our artists and the fact that you have the original design makes the dress priceless. We call it <i>""fabric art.”</i><br/>- The dress, skirt, blouse or scarf are always unique.<br/>- We produce “Made to Order” with the latest fabric printing technology, using only premium quality materials.<br/>- Made in the USA and/or Europe.</p><p><strong>How do we make sure your dress is unique?</strong></p><p>If you don't want to buy a ready-made product from the standard part of our webshop  you have three unique options:</p><p>1. You have at your disposal a state of the art editor which allows you to modify a professional artwork to suit your needs.<br/>2. If you feel creative, you can create your own artwork from scratch.<strong> </strong>(M.H.B.B)<br/>3. Alternatively, you can just pick an existing unique design created by our artists.</p><p>Using these methods: ""ready-made original artwork"",""do it yourself artwork"", and ""modify the original"" will guarantee that the piece you buy from us <u>will be unique in the whole wide world.</u></p><p>The editor is so easy to use that a kid can make stunning looking artworks? The price you pay for a unique dress is having fun. One design, one dress.</p><p><i>M.H.B.B<strong> </strong>= Make History, Build a Brand!</i></p><p><strong>How do we make sure that one dress means one design?</strong><br/>The process goes something like this:</p><p>1. First, we paint on canvas or paper. <br/>2. We digitize the physical art. <br/>3. We add or modify features if needed.<br/>4. In many cases we destroy the original. <br/>5. Only the emotion and memory remain, on your dress.</p><p><i>Disclaimer: We don't use this method for all our products. </i></p><div>

Every one of them had a personal crisis in their lives, because of that, we are all here today. We have confidence in our experience and our skills.</p><p><strong>What is the risk?</strong></p><p>-To be overlooked by women that can afford a luxury product from SecretBrand because they don't know about us.</p><p>-To miss the <i>""must buy""</i> list of women who don't value an unique look.</p><p>-To be misunderstood as another fashion company if we can't explain all the innovations precisely.</p><p>-<i>""Drive to action""</i> is a strange cocktail of emotion and the brand's <i>""wow""</i> factor that can't be precisely predicted.</p><p>We must make sure that we have the <i>""wow""</i> factor; similar to quality jewelry.

Few people will pride themselves with a future SecretBrand item.</p><p>We have another say at SecretBrand: Everything can be done with enough will. We don't want to reinvent the wheel. We just improve the essential parts, get things working together with style and originality. We are doing this for you because we like freedom and choice.</p><p>It is a challenge to grow in the eyes of your future customers and get them to see, really see. A challenge that we enjoy; and that's why we need you to help us. With a team like ours, with the energy and vision, all we need is exposure. Once women see us, there will be no turning back! Do you start to see how this will change you?</p><p>Having a solid growing team will help us attract funding. However, the primary challenge is the future recognition and acceptance of our brand in a market dominated by big corporations with intense competition. This can only be tackled by our team if we maintain a clear and sharp focus on delivering unique luxury.</p><p>The final step is the online medium. People are naturally distrusting of webshops that sell clothes online. You can't touch the fabric; you can't try it on before you buy and there are some limitations faced by the online retailers. We will alleviate these fears once the first customers see that everything is just as pictured on the site.</p><p>At the same time, online orders bring a plethora of questions related to size and/or fabric texture/feel. Fortunately, we do have a solution to all of these issues.</p><p>We mitigate any risk by having a well-rounded and robust team. We can adapt and meet diverse and unpredictable challenges, as we did many times before. The fashion market is healthy, a lot of competition yet most of it is absent from this particular niche; this is why we will have the first mover advantage.

A copy of a phone, watch, purse, dress, etc. Even luxury items are made in hundreds or thousands of copies. With all the technological advancements of our time, there is no way to have a unique product; you have to share it with millions of people. Not anymore! SecretBrand* changes that with your support. We desire to build a webshop where you can design your dresses and create your artwork or pick one from our designers/artist's collections. SecretBrand * it's a startup about fashion, technology, marketing, branding, software, art and e-commerce.We invested three years in solving this problem, and now we have the ideal solution. We are ready to implement the project.After the research and market study were completed, a brand new user-friendly wireframe artwork editor was born. After we did the research, studied the market, and avoided unwanted influences we have created a friendly wireframe editor. This editor will be the core of our posh webshop experience and the central spot where you can buy a dress, a blouse, a skirt, a scarf or just design your own artwork. We use only high-quality materials certified for printing just to be sure that your unique artwork will look great and stand the test of time. (M.H.B.B)You know it's posh because:The artworks made by our designers took six months to complete. The finished product is manufactured exclusively for you and you alone.- The amount of work put in by our artists and the fact that you have the original design makes the dress priceless. We call it ""fabric art.”- The dress, skirt, blouse or scarf are always unique.- We produce “Made to Order” with the latest fabric printing technology, using only premium quality materials.- Made in the USA and/or Europe.How do we make sure your dress is unique?If you don't want to buy a ready-made product from the standard part of our webshop  you have three unique options:1. You have at your disposal a state of the art editor which allows you to modify a professional artwork to suit your needs.2. If you feel creative, you can create your own artwork from scratch. (M.H.B.B)3. Alternatively, you can just pick an existing unique design created by our artists.Using these methods: ""ready-made original artwork"",""do it yourself artwork"", and ""modify the original"" will guarantee that the piece you buy from us will be unique in the whole wide world.The editor is so easy to use that a kid can make stunning looking artworks? The price you pay for a unique dress is having fun. One design, one dress.M.H.B.B = Make History, Build a Brand!How do we make sure that one dress means one design?The process goes something like this:1. First, we paint on canvas or paper. 2. We digitize the physical art. 3. We add or modify features if needed.4. In many cases we destroy the original. 5. Only the emotion and memory remain, on your dress.Disclaimer: We don't use this method for all our products.

With his talent, the team is able to produce the stunning art needed to make each dress unique.In this project, we have a strong executive team as well as a board of advisors. It gives the project that mix of DNA, a plurality of minds that work seamlessly, giving the feeling that complex processes are just simple things.Like always, the simple things are quite complicated.We have a team of thirty people from all around the world, USA, Canada, Australia, Brasil, France, Ukraine, U.K, Russia, Germany, Romania, Italy and it's still growing!Our team is specialized in every relevant domain: fashion design, graphic artist, A/V producer, architecture, art, entrepreneurship, software, e-commerce, intellectual property, branding, advertising, marketing, engineering and textile industry. Our combined experience is over 200 years. SecretBrand * (*currently undisclosed brand luxury fashion) proudly presents the solution for a problem that tormented humanity for at least 100 years.
 
The Problem
You're at a party or meeting, and you see your dress cloned. Ouch! Now you'll be spending the whole night desperately avoiding your look-alike.
Hint: Just Google ""same dress""

 
Why?
An ordinary dress is made from a pre-existing printed material, which either comes from a special store or a fabric store. These fabrics are produced in batches of 1000 to 1000000 sq. ft. Just imagine how many clones can come out of that! How do you feel about your beloved new dress now?
The Solution
A unique graphic design in a dress, skirt or blouse, tailored as the only one in the whole wide world.
Is this really possible?
Now, it is.

 
How?
We are offering you the opportunity to create your artwork either working alone or with our help. You start with an adjustable template and using our exclusive online editor let your imagination run wild.
Or,
You can use and adjust our designers' unique digital artwork. When your design is finished, we take care of everything for you. The dress will be ready to wear delivered at your doorsteps. Unique, only for you.
Are you ready? ( B.B.B.B)
Your unique dress can be on its way.

The Team
We are a multinational team. We spent over three long years of arduous research and creative development until we figured out all the nuts and bolts of the solution.
As a result, we have the necessary technology and the architecture for our online editor, the webshop wireframe and the brain power to make it all fall nicely into place.
Our team of designers and programmers are eager for the final development of this idea; we need to polish the website's design, raise a marketing budget and sort things out in matters of intellectual property. For that, we do need your help!
Will you give us the fuel we need to launch our project?
Join us in this endeavor of providing the unique dress that YOU deserve.
Support us, be a backer! Let’s make the world unique! Thank you!

You can still end up with a dress that is just a little bit different compared to a mass-produced one.How?We work with a well-trained team that has everything figured out with outstanding experience in their fields.What?A strong brand with organic growth. SecretBrand in 6 concepts:- Easy.- 100% original art- Unique in world- Get it all over the world with a click- Smile guaranteed- Handmade   We have a big team; the startup is made up of 30 people. Every one of them had a personal crisis in their lives, because of that, we are all here today. We have confidence in our experience and our skills.What is the risk?-To be overlooked by women that can afford a luxury product from SecretBrand because they don't know about us.-To miss the ""must buy"" list of women who don't value an unique look.-To be misunderstood as another fashion company if we can't explain all the innovations precisely.-""Drive to action"" is a strange cocktail of emotion and the brand's ""wow"" factor that can't be precisely predicted.We must make sure that we have the ""wow"" factor; similar to quality jewelry. Dresses must be displayed. You must be proud to have one and others should want one too. Few people will pride themselves with a future SecretBrand item.We have another say at SecretBrand: Everything can be done with enough will. We don't want to reinvent the wheel. We just improve the essential parts, get things working together with style and originality. We are doing this for you because we like freedom and choice.It is a challenge to grow in the eyes of your future customers and get them to see, really see. A challenge that we enjoy; and that's why we need you to help us. With a team like ours, with the energy and vision, all we need is exposure. Once women see us, there will be no turning back! Do you start to see how this will change you?Having a solid growing team will help us attract funding. However, the primary challenge is the future recognition and acceptance of our brand in a market dominated by big corporations with intense competition. This can only be tackled by our team if we maintain a clear and sharp focus on delivering unique luxury.The final step is the online medium. People are naturally distrusting of webshops that sell clothes online. You can't touch the fabric; you can't try it on before you buy and there are some limitations faced by the online retailers. We will alleviate these fears once the first customers see that everything is just as pictured on the site.At the same time, online orders bring a plethora of questions related to size and/or fabric texture/feel. Fortunately, we do have a solution to all of these issues.We mitigate any risk by having a well-rounded and robust team. We can adapt and meet diverse and unpredictable challenges, as we did many times before. The fashion market is healthy, a lot of competition yet most of it is absent from this particular niche; this is why we will have the first mover advantage. We have the solutions, and now we hope your support.  This is a unique opportunity to be a SecretBrand ambassador, build with us and share! You can do this. We always encourage people to take action. If you like this project, please support it, with money or with personal involvement. Therefore, please share, spread the news or talk about it with your friends! If you want to show us how you promoted SecretBrand* send us a message on our official email, and maybe you will win a discount and a marketing recommendation for your portfolio!  Are you a graphic designer (Illustrator, Painter, Patternizer, Textile designer) with a unique portfolio?Are you interested in becoming an artist/designer for SecretBrand? Drop us an email on design(at)uniqueintheworld.com  with your portfolio and we will get back to you as soon as our campaign has reached its goal!",20.0,24,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello, my name is Sarah.  For a few years I have been making clothes for myself &amp; some close friends, people like what I made so I created an Etsy &amp; occasionally receive an order from someone to create a unique, one off garment for them.  I'd love to quit my day job &amp; sew every day, creating things I love for people who will love them as equally, currently however this cannot happen, for a few reasons:</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Risks and challenges</p>
<p>As with any apparel production process, there are always risks that are out of our control. (Natural disasters, untimely accidents, zombie apocalypse, etc). All those fancy jackets and pants with 104 different pockets and accessories provide 104 different problems and customer complaints. You don't have that worry with Moment. <br/>Our team's experience with major brands and production should calm your nerves. Plus we've produced an initial line already with success and many other orders for our existing customer base so our quality in fit and function have been solidified. <br/>Our textile genius has 25 years of experience and a personal and professional relationship with our manufacturer that's lasted over 10 years. <br/>Our biggest challenge will be man hours to ship your products on a timely fashion. This is the primary reason to offer only one color in each shirt at this time. We will keep you updated on delivery dates but we do ask for your patience as the man hours to receive, warehouse, input inventory into the system, pull orders and ship is quite large and we want to set the right expectations. Believe me, we've read all the comments both positive and negative with these kind of projects. <br/>It's not guaranteed like death and taxes but we feel like we have minimized the challenges so that you can have the utmost mental confidence that we deliver what we promise.</p>

<h3><strong>SYMBOL OF CLARITY</strong></h3>
<p>Throughout time, “Clarity” has been universally represented symbolically by the circle and triangle.</p>
<p>The Symbol of Clarity represents what every athlete needs to perform at the highest level. Athletes often refer to clarity as “the zone”. But it’s more than just a physical feeling. It’s a feeling that all the human senses are working together to “slow things down”, and the brain is processing those thoughts and feelings with ease.</p>
<p>When the senses perform at this level, then so too does the athlete. A confidence and calmness takes over that is….. ”CLARITY”.</p>

Risks & Challenges
Risks and challenges
As with any apparel production process, there are always risks that are out of our control. (Natural disasters, untimely accidents, zombie apocalypse, etc). All those fancy jackets and pants with 104 different pockets and accessories provide 104 different problems and customer complaints. You don't have that worry with Moment. Our team's experience with major brands and production should calm your nerves. Plus we've produced an initial line already with success and many other orders for our existing customer base so our quality in fit and function have been solidified. Our textile genius has 25 years of experience and a personal and professional relationship with our manufacturer that's lasted over 10 years. Our biggest challenge will be man hours to ship your products on a timely fashion. This is the primary reason to offer only one color in each shirt at this time. We will keep you updated on delivery dates but we do ask for your patience as the man hours to receive, warehouse, input inventory into the system, pull orders and ship is quite large and we want to set the right expectations. Believe me, we've read all the comments both positive and negative with these kind of projects. It's not guaranteed like death and taxes but we feel like we have minimized the challenges so that you can have the utmost mental confidence that we deliver what we promise.

Other Ways You Can Help
Sometimes extra money is not available or our product doesn't fit your needs.  But if you love our brand and our platform, please consider visiting our social media pages and follow or like.  It would mean a lot to our growth and we can't thank you enough.
 
SYMBOL OF CLARITY
Throughout time, “Clarity” has been universally represented symbolically by the circle and triangle.
The Symbol of Clarity represents what every athlete needs to perform at the highest level. Athletes often refer to clarity as “the zone”. But it’s more than just a physical feeling. It’s a feeling that all the human senses are working together to “slow things down”, and the brain is processing those thoughts and feelings with ease.
When the senses perform at this level, then so too does the athlete. A confidence and calmness takes over that is….. ”CLARITY”.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

Most are made from plastic and they are often poorly fitting, break easily and every pair made is a threat to marine life.Our idea: Transform the flip flop market; move away from plastic (including recycled) and deliver an eco-friendly product with comfort, style, and durability whilst also providing a simple way for everyone to stop ocean-bound plastic.* Source: Biological Sciences Department, University of California San Diego.​After a year in the making, we have:
Sourced eco-friendly materials
Designed a great range of flip flops alongside Havaianas' former Head of Research and Development
Selected incredible grassroots organisations that we will be supporting; Plastic Bank, Plastic Oceans International, Ocean Sole Africa and Blue Crew
Undertaken a successful trial release
Our flip flops are completely earth-friendly. If you lose your flip flops at sea or they end up buried in your garden, or even in landfill, they will break down and not have a negative effect on that environment. They are made from Biodegradable Natural Rubber. No plastic, no pollution, no harm to our planet.  In 2021, through the sales of our flip flops, we will collect the equivalent of one million ocean-bound plastic bottles (20,000kg of plastic) from rivers and coastlines, with this target increasing year on year as we grow. How? Plastic pollution is a result of the lack of incentives to recycle where they are needed most. We will use profits to fund a network of grassroots organisations, in developing countries; offering cash, food vouchers, education materials and medical supplies in exchange for collected plastic. This system helps protect our oceans, as well as providing vital support to those in need. This a truly unique way of using fashion for good.If we could produce a truly desirable flip flop, then we had a real chance of making change happen. So, naturally, we called Brazil, the ""home of the flip flop"", and enlisted the help of the former Havaianas' Head of Research and Development, Alexandre Coelho. We examined over 30 flip flop brands, read product reviews and conducted countless consumer interviews to understand your needs and develop a fantastic product.We wanted to come up with solutions to all of the flip flop issues that drive you crazy, and we have delivered on the issues most important to you!   It was important enough for many of you to tell us about, so as requested, we will also offer our flip flops with the option of:
Contrasting logos, so you can be loud and proud about your Sea Sense flip flops (blue logo on our white flip flops, white on other colours)
The logo the same colour as the flip flop, if you're looking for that more subtle, formal look 
Our small trial release tested our manufacturing and shipping systems. We offered blue, black and white flip flops. Immediately it became apparent that you wanted colour! Our original colours are still available here, but we are so excited about the new colour options we have for you. Our flip flops are completely inspired by our oceans; whether it be the bold colours we have used and the materials we have made the flip flops from, or the unique wave pattern we have designed on the sole. They are unlike any other flip flops out there. Our flip flops follow three simple principles: sustainability, design, and fair price. We asked ourselves the question, what use are sustainable products if they’re ugly and unaffordable for most people? So we have worked hard to make a beautiful flip flop and ensure that sustainability is accessible to all.     Based on the classic, much loved, thong flip flop, but vastly improved. With detailed styling including our unique wave design on the strap, our men's flip flops have a masculine yet refined look. They are comfortable, long-lasting, and up for whatever challenge you throw at them, at the beach or in the city. Bold and stylish, we have made a flip flop for all occasions.We have a wonderful selection of colours, as bold as you want to be. From our Orca Black, Deep Ocean Blue and Iceberg White, through to our brighter Fire Coral Red, Sea Grass Green and Sea Breeze Green. Simple and chic were the buzzwords for us when designing our women's flip flop. With a slightly thinner sole and a more elegant strap, our women's flip flops are as sleek and beautiful as they are durable.We didn't want to compromise on style just because we are using sustainable products, so we designed this range especially for women who want both. The perfect shoe for daytime or evening, we are really proud of this design.We wanted to mix the formal with the summery in our collection. We have our staples of Orca Black, Deep Ocean Blue and Iceberg White, as well as the dazzling Coral Pink, Parrotfish Green and Sandy Gold.   If you back the project, our team will reach out when the campaign has ended, sending you the full pdf. catalogue of sizes and colours (including logo variations) to help you choose your preference. We will offer women’s sizing in UK 3-7 and men's UK 8-12. We will be growing the range of sizes, but as a start up we had to follow the market research. For the ladies, the size 8UK men's flip flop may be an option if you are looking for something slightly larger than a 7UK and you still want to support our project.       Our priority was to never use plastic, even if it was recycled. We do not endorse plastic as a material, and we didn't want to add to the plastic pollution problem. From early on we made the decision to make our flip flops from natural rubber and we had no idea how the natural rubber would feel once we were wearing it. What we found out, when we had the flip flops on our feet (literally every day for the last 6 months), was really exciting!Our flip flops provide a supportive, soft, and comfortable fit. Natural rubber moulds to your feet. It feels like you're walking on a cloud, and that reduced impact when you walk, is great for your joints.             As well as comfort, our flip-flips are designed to last. Even under extreme tension, they do not buckle and fold, as regular flip flops do. Often when flip flops get bent once, they lose their shape and are more likely to break or be uncomfortable.            Natural Rubber is incredibly elastic, which ensures our flip flops are super durable. We have walked more miles than we can remember wearing these, without any failure, and we have pulled and twisted the straps without them snapping, including testing for those dreaded ""toe-plug blowouts"".            If you've suffered from flip flops pinching across the top of your foot, or if you're prone to blisters from the toe peg, you no longer have to worry about that, natural rubber is incredibly soft!In shops our flip flops will retail at £24 (not including postage). Through Indiegogo, you have the opportunity to save 22% per pair. Don't let their affordability make you question their durability; we want as many of you as possible to have the chance make a difference, to do that, we will always choose impact over profit.Our Reward prices are inclusive of UK postage, which means you are actually saving even more! Unfortunately, we cannot provide free international postage, but we offer it at a much reduced rate; we want the whole world to have access to our flip flops. After extensive research, we started talking to rubber tree farmers in Vietnam and found the farmer that paid the staff a good wage and worked in the most environmentally friendly way. No trees are cut down, rubber is simply ""tapped"" from them. This can be done throughout the life cycle of the tree.    We love the way they work, in the traditional way, by hand; whether collecting the rubber in the same way it has been done for centuries or hand-cutting the rubber sheets ready for our flip flops.We were recently recognised and approved by PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) as being 100% vegan, giving you peace of mind that we source materials and manufacture our flip flops in the most ethical way possible.Our Founder, Luke, has worked in marine conservation for the last 10 years. After seeing first hand the damage that we are doing to our oceans, through our use and improper disposal of plastics, he has relentlessly campaigned for change.By using the world's most popular shoe, and building a network of incredible grassroots organisations, he set out to help solve one of the world's biggest environmental problems.Since then, we have grown our multinational team, and are proud to have a great product that we truly believe can transform the current plastic-driven flip flop market.This is just the beginning for Sea Sense; there is an opportunity for people around the world to make a difference to our oceans, and it is so exciting to have already received incredible support and good wishes.If successful, we can serve as a blueprint for other sustainable fashion start-ups, which can only be good for our planet.The core team hail from the UK, South Africa, and Brazil, and we share a common interest in the environment and a desire to make a  change in the world. We bring a diverse skill set to the project, including marine biology, conservation, design, financial technology, media production, and web design.We chose to support the organisations through which you, the consumer, could achieve the greatest impact, every time you bought a pair of Sea Sense flip flops. We cannot wait to grow this network of organisations in the years to come.Plastic Bank has been able to monetise plastic in a number of developing countries, meaning that collectors are able to exchange plastic for vouchers that help buy food and medical supplies as well as pay for education. They operate in Haiti, Brazil, Indonesia, the Philippines, and Egypt. We cannot wait to see the impact we can achieve alongside them.Plastic Oceans International is a non-profit organisation whose goal is to end plastic pollution and to foster sustainable communities worldwide. They operate to create change globally, and they have branches in the USA, Canada, Europe, Mexico, and Chile. They believe that education and awareness are key in preventing plastics from entering our oceans, and we are delighted to be able to support an organisation that is doing this across the world.Ocean Sole is a social enterprise, that up-cycle flip flops found along the beaches and waterways in Kenya into beautiful pieces of art. Ocean Sole provides a steady income to nearly 100 low-income Kenyan families, help facilitate payments for educating their children, and recycle over a million flip flops each year, preventing them from polluting our oceans. We are proud to help support their incredible work!The Blue Crew, a team of local female entrepreneurs in South Africa, hope to address both the environmental and social challenges linked to waste accumulating along coastlines. These ambassadors for the blue-economy clean up coasts daily and inspire others to do the same. The Blue Crew also barter the waste they collect with the WILDTRUST (who then recycle it) in exchange for cash, and thus generate livelihood support for themselves whilst cleaning up critical ecosystems.* Indegogo guidelines state we cannot directly donate any funds we receive from this campaign. Instead, we will donate all future proceeds from sales following the Indiegogo Campaign, until we collect the equivalent of at least 500 plastic bottles per pair of flip flops sold in this campaign (which is more than the average person will use in three years!). That is our promise to you. Transparency is important to us, so we will keep in touch after campaign to update you on our progress, and also send you our annual impact report.We have brought on-board quality and reliable partners to make the perfect flip flop.

</div></div>","What’s The Problem With Todays Hoodie?

Cotton & Polyester Fabric - Lack the ability to breathe, fight odor, regulate your body temperature, wick away sweat, and defend against stains.

Woven Fabric - Restrictive, can make seams susceptible to tearing

Storage & Security - Pockets lack size and ability to store your valuables securely.

Versatility - Lack of design means poor fit and an unflattering look, limiting your ability to wear it on different occasions.
What’s The Solution?Introducing: 'The Miracle Merino Hoodie' by GrunardMerino - Natures Miracle FabricSpecifications

Design Detail
Custom Logo and Zipper Pulls

Versatile 


With a clean look, subtle seam lines, striking zipper, and modern fit, our hoodie can be worn out to dinner, to the gym, on a hike, or even on a hot date.







Cost



The value of Merino is found in it's extensive list of properties and the skilled labor it takes to produce this amazing fabric.  




Price


World class fabric and thoughtful design carry a hefty price tag.   But we are offering our backers an amazing discount exclusive to this campaign.



Fit

Our Unisex hoodie has a slimmer fit, without being overly tight on men or too loose on women.  If you do you prefer a looser fit, we suggest ordering one size up from your normal.
Color Options


The hoodie will be offered in black.  As we reach funding goals new colors will be unlocked.  If we reach 40k, backers will be able to vote on the next color.
Why Grunard?
Because we believe in quality fabric, versatility, and attention to detail.  No other fabric on the market can match the overwhelming capabilities of Merino, giving it an unmatched versatility that we here at Grunard apply to our design philosophy.  We tirelessly scrutinize everything from the placement, size, and usability of the pockets, to the tiny details like our custom zipper pulls and logo.  Finally, we focus on our products, not our profit.


Why Crowdfunding?
We have spent a lot of our own money on creating the pattern, sourcing the materials, making samples, and securing a manufacturing quote to produce our Merino hoodie.  In order to move forward with production we need to meet their minimum garment quote, which in monetary value comes out to $10,000.  This is where the power of the crowd is key, as pre-orders allow us to meet this minimum.

Design and develop an exclusive fashion range by Anna Perra
Combine Italian design with UK and European production using the highest quality fabrics.

Anna Perra moved from Rome to England in 1996. Her love for fashion started when very young. Today she is pursuing her dream – ‘I have a passion for dressing women to look great – no matter their size or age. I love to see a transformation that influences self-esteem and confidence – ultimately having a wider impact on lives and relationships!’ Anna established her brand through passion and tenacity but it was her loyalty and care for customers that gave Anna direction for her fashion concept. Encouraging women to feel good and rediscover themselves through the clothes they wear, has made her brand more than fashion. Customers – ‘Real Women’ - are also modelling for Anna’s ready to wear collections at her fashion shows set in gorgeous destinations. They are very much part of her brand as the clothes she selects.Why are we Crowdfunding?

Anna has devoted the last two years to developing her fashion concept while nurturing a strong desire to design her own collection. The Anna Perra Fashion collection will start with winter coats, a proven idea – she has already trialled two designs and showcased them at one of her fashion shows, where they received a very positive response. Since then, she has been constantly asked to create more of her own style. The inevitable Italian touch of elegance colour & detail is what characterize Anna’s style – customers are waiting for her exclusive designs to be available in the near future. Anna’s business plan is to raise money to design and produce the Anna Perra Fashion range, and promote her collection using a highly professional standard of marketing techniquesWhat we currently offer

<li>MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES We learned different methods of how glasses are manufactured by going straight to the sources. Then, because we’re designing for a new functionality in sunglasses, we took a completely fresh approach to the materials and construction. We asked ourselves: What materials or construction methods might not be considered ""standard"" but actually work better to solve the problem? </li>
<li>MATERIAL SELECTION It was important to us that we understand the material properties best suited not just for functionality, but also for ideal comfort and fit. Lightweight and durable, made of face-friendly soft touch materials for comfort and non-slip wearing. Instead of hard frames that hurt your head or slide off your nose, we've designed them to be the most comfy frames to grace your face. </li>
<li>FUNCTION + FIT FOR ALL Rather than producing a bunch of seasonal frames, we are focused on the optimum fit in two shapes: The wayfarer-style and the aviator are timeless, unisex styles that suit all faces. </li>

Past solutions to this problem left you with two choices:
Clutter your expensive glasses with uncomfortable and unflattering ""sunglass straps"" 
Resort to the endless cycles of cheaply made ""disposable"" sunglasses that risk not providing your eyes with the true benefits of protection 
After he lost his most expensive pair of sunglasses, our co-founder Nate Justiss was fed up and finally had an a-ha moment. And with that, we set out to design an elegant solution made to satisfy the picky minimalist. We've spent 6 years in development to get it right, and now we want to share it with you. 


 


Falling-Sunglasses Fail vs. Secure with MagLock How did we solve dropped and lost sunglasses? Magnets hidden in the arms secure your glasses to your shirt, bag, and any magnetic surface. And with flexible, unbreakable shape-memory frames, and our super strong, anti-scratch lenses, you don't have to worry about breaking your MagLock Sunglasses. Finally you can feel as carefree not wearing your sunglasses as you do wearing them.    MagLock Sunglasses are built for comfort and made to last. Take them with you everywhere– from your daily commute to your next outdoor adventure.  

Actual Hammer and Flex Test 
  MagLock™ is our all new patent-pending design with neodymium magnets incorporated into the arms of the frame. The magnets are completely integrated so that no surface meets your skin (safe for those with nickel allergies), and the magnets themselves will be free of surface wear, scratching or corrosion.  Frame Features: 
MagLock™ secures your glasses to your shirt or bag, and will stay in place any magnetic surface
Face friendly soft-touch materials for comfort and non-slip fit
Lightweight, flexible frame comfortably hugs your head 
Durable high-performance material with shape memory: MagLock Sunglasses are made to last 
Lens Features:
100% UVA and UVB protection 
Polarized core reduces glare and eye strain 
Anti-reflective interior 
Scratch-resistant exterior and interior
PSA: Sunglasses are good for you! The American Academy of Ophthalmology has designated July as ""UV Safety Awareness Month."" Protecting your eyes isn’t just for the summer months– UV light contributes to macular degeneration, cataracts, and other eye complications. Cheap sunglasses falsely claiming to protect against UV let even more of the harmful UV rays into your dilated pupils, potentially causing more damage than not wearing sunglasses at all.We've sourced premium UV400 lenses, which block 100% of UVA and UVB rays, plus a polarized core and anti-reflective coating to further reduce glare and eye strain. Lightweight, FDA approved impact-resistant lenses are in a neutral gray color to ease eye strain and allow for truest color perception.  Sunnies are notoriously difficult to keep track of, and the best pair really are the ones you have with you. That’s why we’ve designed these sunglasses to be the most comfortable sunglasses to wear and the most difficult to lose.   

ON THE LIGHT SWITCH for grab-and-go convenience.

ON THE FRIDGE so you always know where your sunglasses are.

ON THE REAR-VIEW MIRROR because polarized glasses protect against road glare.Pro Tip: Don't keep sunglasses in the car during the summer! Heat damages the lenses.

ON YOUR BAG for scratch-free storage on the go (instead of on your head).
Folly: The Laidback Seafarer in a classic wayfarer-style with keyhole bridge. Named after Folly Beach, Charleston’s surf-haven at the “Edge of America.” After the campaign, you can choose from 4 matte colors: Black, Gray, Kelp (Dark Green) and Surf (Turquoise).   Sullivan: The Modern Aviator in a lightweight with iconic double bridge. Named after Sullivan’s Island, home of Charleston’s surprisingly modern lighthouse. After the campaign, you can choose from 4 matte colors: Black, Gray, Marine (Dark Blue) and Sand (Warm Tan).Sunglasses are an essential part of your everyday carry, and MagLock Sunglasses are ready for any adventure! We've considered the entire package, down to... well, the package! ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ We designed a collapsible hard case and soft lens-cleaning cloth sleeve, included with every pair to help keep your Distil Sunglasses protected and scratch-free.Instead of a box that will just be thrown away, all MagLock Sunglasses are packaged in an innovative hardshell case that folds completely flat. Based on the original design by Tom Davies (British bespoke-glasses creator and all-around swell guy), our take is inspired by the Apple iPad Cover: Durable fabric case with soft-touch lining, finished with heat-sealed edges for a clean, modern look. These cases are so useful and unique, we've made them available as a separate pledge level to use with any glasses up to 142mm x 55mm. Keep your other sunglasses or prescription glasses scratch-free and protected in your bag.   In 2011, Nate lost the most expensive pair of sunglasses he’d ever bought. He was determined never to lose a pair of glasses again. It was the year we founded Distil Union, and Nate disappeared into the workshop and hacked together a simple fix using a pair of shades he didn’t really care about messing up.... and guess what? He hasn't lost that DIY pair, 6 years later. The tweak worked. His determination paid off. A huge perk about having a workshop is that we can create hacks that make a difference in our own lives #makersgonnamake. Beyond making and hacking, we have over a decade of experience in actual large scale mass-market manufacturing. So we've been working hard to develop a manufacturing technique to produce these problem-solving shades on a larger scale. And the best thing for us about crowd-funding is the chance to bring those life-simplifying products to other people’s lives! How does this simple, integrated solution not already exist?! We've asked ourselves the same question– and one reason they haven’t been made yet is because it’s not easy (as we've learned). Other attempts have been made to solve this problem, of course, but for us they all miss the mark. Each and every one requires that you use something in addition to the glasses, which goes against one of our fundamental beliefs: The Distil Union mission is to simplify your life and distil your everyday. Our products are simply functional, and made to satisfy the picky minimalist. Only an elegant, integrated solution will do– so we’ve spent years in development to get it right:
MANUFACTURING TECHNIQUES We learned different methods of how glasses are manufactured by going straight to the sources. Then, because we’re designing for a new functionality in sunglasses, we took a completely fresh approach to the materials and construction. We asked ourselves: What materials or construction methods might not be considered ""standard"" but actually work better to solve the problem? 
MATERIAL SELECTION It was important to us that we understand the material properties best suited not just for functionality, but also for ideal comfort and fit. Lightweight and durable, made of face-friendly soft touch materials for comfort and non-slip wearing. Instead of hard frames that hurt your head or slide off your nose, we've designed them to be the most comfy frames to grace your face. 
FUNCTION + FIT FOR ALL Rather than producing a bunch of seasonal frames, we are focused on the optimum fit in two shapes: The wayfarer-style and the aviator are timeless, unisex styles that suit all faces. 
Xiexie 谢谢 and mhgoi 唔該 to our Asia team! From Hong Kong to Shenzhen– Anson, Tracy, Karen, Tim, Eunice, Simon, Fong, Sandy and Leon!Our manufacturing partners know their craft. Lindsay and Nate toured their facilities earlier this year and worked with them face-to-face to develop our unique frames. They produce eyeglasses for premium brands and are one of the world's largest manufacturers of high-end acetate frames. We wish we could take you on a tour of their place (so large it takes a golf cart to get around). It is one of the most pristine and highest-tech, vertically integrated factories we've ever been to. With their backing, we're confident we can deliver an on-time and quality product.  Wearing 3D-printed glasses makes you feel like you're in the future...PROTOTYPE GALLERY: 3D-prints in various materials to test size, fit and function of our designs
Universally flattering frame shapes, and they flex to comfortably fit heads of nearly every size   Seeing how people react when they try our prototypes has been oh so satisfying, and we’re ready to go from prototype into production. Our goal is to deliver the most comfortable, long-lasting sunglasses you’ve ever owned. And with your help, we can finally get our patent-pending design out into the world. Please keep in mind that Indiegogo is not a traditional store. Backing us means you're pledging your support because you believe in our design and our ability to deliver (as we have on all our previous 6 crowd-funding campaigns on Kickstarter). As a way to say thank you! for believing in us, you get a massive discount and first access to the new product, as well as updates along the way as our production journey continues beyond this campaign.  Distil Union is a micro-collective of designers and design-lovers in Charleston, SC who are having fun (and working hard) creating solutions to real-life problems. Our incentive to innovate comes from a deep desire to create helpful objects that people love. In 2011, we joined together (Union, get it?) to create the products we want to see on the shelves. Selfish? Perhaps. Exciting? You bet your pants it is! Entirely self-funded on a bootstrap budget, we launched our first product on Kickstarter in 2012. After working in the “big-box retail” industry for so long, it was a rush being part of the dynamic crowdfunding community that allowed us as designers to connect directly with customers, users, backers – you. And that was it, we were hooked.  Since our first Kickstarter in 2012, thousands of Distil Union goods have been shipped to 101 countries, including 5,141 on-time pledges. We’re lucky to have been on our life-simplifying mission now for six years, and with six successful campaigns under our belt, this will be our 7th Kickstarter. Our company and products have been featured in: To bring these sunglasses to life, we're seeking the funding needed to pay for tooling.

<h2>Why I designed the WoodFa LTD05</h2>
<p>My fascination with this project began with one of the world's best precision cutting tools - the LTD-05 from the Japanese artisans at the firm OLFA. They designed the ultra-slim, stainless steel knife which remains one of the the top cutting tools for graphic artists, fashion designers and sign makers around the world. It's 30 degree cutting angle and snap off blades can handle intricate cutting patterns on all kinds of materials. </p>
<p>The problem is that this high quality precision tool comes with a low tech user interface. The industrial grade plastic that holds the blades just isn't comfortable for long term use, can become hard to grip and tends to crack with heavy use.</p>
<p><img alt=""LTD05"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/65451068/woodfa/LTD05.jpg"" src="""" style="""" title=""LTD05""/></p>
<p>I decided that it was time this precision instrument needed a better handle, so I built one the the old-fashioned way – I carved a handle out of wood. I've been using my new blade for over a year now. It provides so much more control and comfort, I want others artists to see what they can achieve with the perfect cutter.</p>

experience, when you are doubtful about locking the door. A few seconds of
uncertainty could force you to return home just to check it. In the worst case,
your home could be burgled.

""We’ve all been there.  Driving to work and simply CANNOT remember if you
 locked your door on the way out.  Worry no more. CleKee allows you to 
be certain that your door is locked..."" - Cool Things Addict""In the worst case, your home could be burgled."" - Mother Joint Magazine for Apple Devices""Finally, nobody wants to share information about their homes with hackers or criminals."" - Mother Joint Magazine for Android Devices""...緑の表示であれば「OK。鍵しまってるよ」."" - EtiWO Blog - CleKee""CleKee works without the need to access your mobile device, the Internet, never
needs a charge, and most importantly? No monthly fee is required."" - Dustin Wright - CPC Magazine




Key Features

This small unique device directly mounted on your
key gives you an answer to your doubts and you will feel safe again - anytime
and everywhere.
CleKee is using a newly developed unique precise
mechanism, which allows him to work independently without any connection to
your smartphone or even to the internet, so your personal privacy stays
completely untouched. Moreover, you will never need to recharge CleKee or to
pay monthly fees.



What is Included? 

CleKee Device

CleKee Home Sign
Ring





  How to Use CleKee?  You can use CleKee the same way as your key before.

CleKee Green Indicator - door is locked

CleKee Red Indicator - door is open

CleKee White Indicator - service position or you are at home (option)

Be certain that your door is locked. Do
not give the housebreakers any
opportunity to visit your home.
Stop asking yourself if you locked the door.
Don’t return home to check it anymore. Just have a look at your CleKee  and
you will immediately feel safe about your home – anywhere and anytime.

Due to the
sophisticated design and construction, it is very simple to join your key to the CleKee.When you also use the key to lock the door from inside, the CleKee is
able to recognize it. We developed “Home Sign Ring”, which is attached directly
to the lock from inside for this purpose.The first generation
of the CleKee could be used for the most common lock and key systems with vertical keyhole orientation. You can
easily measure, if this newly developed unique device fits for your key. The
length is measured from the point where the key is touching the lock surface. As the
picture below shows, the maximum length of the key should not be longer than
36 mm or 1.42 in and the width could vary up to 30 mm or 1.18 in.How Does it Work?
The CleKee is equipped with a sophisticated and precise mechanism,
which is able to recognize and store information needed to analyze the key-lock
interactions during opening and closing your home front door.
The CleKee unique precise mechanism is based on following forces and
movements: 


Force of Gravity
Rotation (provides the information about locking or
unlocking the door)
Mechanical Touch Sensor (gives the fact if the key is
in the door)



Restrictions 
The CleKee could
not operate in the space now (due to the missing gravity), however
we are also working at this issue.

<p>After years of trying to solve the SMS (Sweat Mark Syndrome), I had accumulated a large pile of flimsy mismatched handmade pieces of fabrics.  They are all different shapes and sizes, weak and easily warped.  Getting a proper fitting pair of stays was always a challenge.  And on many occasions the under arms of my shirts still looked wet.  But the biggest problem of all was the time and effort wasted. </p>

<h3>Risks and challenges:</h3>
<p>So here is where you come in. Trying to simplify everyday life and designing a cool product is what we do day-in and day-out either in our head or on paper. But like most designers our dream is to eventually make a product that can change solve a big problem. But funding, manufacturing and distributing a new product is a whole other story. Indiegogo is a great way for us to realize many of the ideas that we have in our small studio that we know people will love but big companies are scared to do. We love creating cool stuff without the big company politics and indecision. We believe in the emerging power of community and the individual to bring ideas to life and we hope that this is just the beginning.</p>

<h3>The family behind the watch</h3>
<div>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">My father, René Attias, started manufacturing watches in Paris in 1975. He was considered a true pioneer in his time.</span><br/>
</div>
<div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434119775/ubixa1piptbjumw0kh2r.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div>
<div>
<p>Inspired by his craft and creativity, I joined him at the age of 24. He taught me everything I know about watches. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434119824/gu3dezzxxrecuxilyp8n.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>From designing, to conception, prototyping, testing, quality control and so on...<br/><br/>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434119881/jqvka2q4upivscmez1mj.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Our
family used to own a watch case factory in Besançon (well known for being an
historical region for watch manufacturing) as well as our own assembly unit. In
the 80s, the birth of quartz movements revolutionized the industry. French
factories back then were only making mechanical watches. They closed down one
by one. Ours was no exception.

<p><span>In early 90s, we transferred our
knowledge to Hong Kong, where we developed
strong bonds with some of the best manufacturers in the region.</span><span>  There we learned that professionalism and care do not necessarily
depend on nationalities or countries. While we always keep close control of the whole manufacturing process, we know for sure that our watches are being very well taken care
of by our suppliers.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Where do we produce the watch?</h3>
<div>Just as for the majority of watch brands, one cannot make each and every part of a watch oneself. A good watch manufacturer
builds a network of excellency through years of relationships with professional suppliers,
efficient in the art of making their component.  I was lucky to inherit these  suppliers and friends through my father.</div>The design and final quality control is handled in <b>Paris</b>, near <i>Arts et Métier,</i> a well known parisian district for fashion accessories, craftmanship and watches.</div>

<h3>Why your support is so important.</h3>
<div>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The idea behind the fun and quirky concept of bottled watches arose from
the 2008 economic crisis, which
led us to want to diversify our production and stay independent as a watch
manufacturing company.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434384400/kdb8vl2l17p9qzhbgo0e.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>Today, I want to persevere in creation and innovation, like my father before me. This requires significant investment in research and development, which is leading the company to reorient its strategy towards new business models.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1434384855/wituzjqlzbvbcbuxhmne.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>Why crowdfunding?</p>
<p>For a small company, to successfully launch a new watch, you have to know how to innovate in every area. It is somewhat akin to launching a start-up. Crowdfunding is a unique, accessible and very interesting opportunity when you are short on funding but not short on ideas. ""For the first time in forty years of family watchmaking history, a watch will be launched using crowdfunding from fans of design products. This way, we wish to harness the full potential of the Web, while developing strong, important links with new communities. ""</p>
Where will the funds go ?
</div>
<div>The money raised on this project will go to production cost, prototyping and tooling cost, as well as the marketing cost of this campaign.</div>
<div>
<p></p>
<h3>Risks and Challenges </h3>
<p>We are well
experienced in the art of conceiving and manufacturing watches. However, a
watch is made out of many specific parts such as the movement, the dial, the
hand set, the glass, the straps etc…. A delay during the manufacturing process
of any of these parts could potentially delay the entire process. For instance,
in 2011, the Fukushima incident caused delays in the production of our Japanese
quartz movements. Having built steady relationship with our suppliers helps
smooth out these situations, to minimize any delays.</p>
<p>This is our
first crowdfunding campaign ever and quite a challenging one. We chose to go
for a fixed campaign, meaning it’s all or nothing. We did not want our
contributors to feel uncertain about being charged even if we don’t reach our goal.
</p>
<p>So if we don’t
pull this off, you won’t get charged for your perk.</p>

The project
Sometimes it all starts with the story about how people meet...

My name is
David Attias, I am a French watch designer and founder of Thirsty Watch. I
love graphic design and pop culture. Anything cool from the 50s to the 80s
makes me feel nostalgic.
Vintage
Soda  is definitely the most personal watch I have ever designed. I had this idea in the back of my head for several
years but did not have the funds or support needed to release it. That was until I met my very good friend Alejandra Soriano, who is
an expert in Social Media. 




Based on a
common passion for creative design, (as well as for fine Mexican food), we
decided to join forces to make the Vintage Soda watch a reality. 


Concept & Inspiration


The 1950s were major creative years in the visual
world of American sodas. 



Click here to pre-order your watch

The cap and label reflected the taste and spirit of
the drink. I believe the creativity shown during those years influenced the evolution of today's
graphic arts.

Timeline



The family behind the watch

My father, René Attias, started manufacturing watches in Paris in 1975. He was considered a true pioneer in his time.



Inspired by his craft and creativity, I joined him at the age of 24. He taught me everything I know about watches. 
From designing, to conception, prototyping, testing, quality control and so on...
Our
family used to own a watch case factory in Besançon (well known for being an
historical region for watch manufacturing) as well as our own assembly unit. In
the 80s, the birth of quartz movements revolutionized the industry. French
factories back then were only making mechanical watches. They closed down one
by one. Ours was no exception.

In early 90s, we transferred our
knowledge to Hong Kong, where we developed
strong bonds with some of the best manufacturers in the region.  There we learned that professionalism and care do not necessarily
depend on nationalities or countries. While we always keep close control of the whole manufacturing process, we know for sure that our watches are being very well taken care
of by our suppliers.



Where do we produce the watch?
Just as for the majority of watch brands, one cannot make each and every part of a watch oneself. A good watch manufacturer
builds a network of excellency through years of relationships with professional suppliers,
efficient in the art of making their component.  I was lucky to inherit these  suppliers and friends through my father.The design and final quality control is handled in Paris, near Arts et Métier, a well known parisian district for fashion accessories, craftmanship and watches.

The making of our movement, the heart of a watch, is handled in Japan by our long term supplier Miyota.




The assembly and making of the watch case, is handled by our supplier and friend of many years in Hong Kong.



He has handled the production of our watches for many years. There is no one else I would trust to do this job.The Team





Why your support is so important.





The idea behind the fun and quirky concept of bottled watches arose from
the 2008 economic crisis, which
led us to want to diversify our production and stay independent as a watch
manufacturing company.




Today, I want to persevere in creation and innovation, like my father before me. This requires significant investment in research and development, which is leading the company to reorient its strategy towards new business models.



Why crowdfunding?
For a small company, to successfully launch a new watch, you have to know how to innovate in every area. It is somewhat akin to launching a start-up. Crowdfunding is a unique, accessible and very interesting opportunity when you are short on funding but not short on ideas. ""For the first time in forty years of family watchmaking history, a watch will be launched using crowdfunding from fans of design products. This way, we wish to harness the full potential of the Web, while developing strong, important links with new communities. ""
Where will the funds go ?

The money raised on this project will go to production cost, prototyping and tooling cost, as well as the marketing cost of this campaign.


Risks and Challenges 
We are well
experienced in the art of conceiving and manufacturing watches. However, a
watch is made out of many specific parts such as the movement, the dial, the
hand set, the glass, the straps etc…. A delay during the manufacturing process
of any of these parts could potentially delay the entire process. For instance,
in 2011, the Fukushima incident caused delays in the production of our Japanese
quartz movements. Having built steady relationship with our suppliers helps
smooth out these situations, to minimize any delays.
This is our
first crowdfunding campaign ever and quite a challenging one. We chose to go
for a fixed campaign, meaning it’s all or nothing. We did not want our
contributors to feel uncertain about being charged even if we don’t reach our goal.

So if we don’t
pull this off, you won’t get charged for your perk.


It's Vintage Soda time !

Le Projet 

Parfois, tout commence par l'histoire d'une rencontre...
Je m'appelle David Attias, je suis créateur et fondateur des montres Thirsty Watch. J'adore le graphisme et la culture pop. Tout ce qui touche aux années 50 à 80 me rend nostalgique. 
Vintage Soda est sans l'ombre d'un doute, la montre la plus personnelle qui m'aitété donnée de dessiner. J'avais d'ailleurs cette idée dans la tête depuis quelquesannées sans jamais oser la lancer, faute de moyens financiers et humains. C'est enrencontrant mon amie Alejandra Soriano, experte des réseaux sociaux, que lasolution du financement collectif est apparue. 



Poussés par une passion commune pour le design et la créativité (mais aussi pour la cuisine mexicaine de qualité), nous avons décidé de collaborer ensemble pour faire du projet Vintage Soda une réalité .

Concept et Inspiration


Les
années 50 ont été des millésimes créatifs majeurs dans l’univers visuel des sodas
américains. 



cliquez ici pour réserver votre montre
La
capsule et l’étiquette traduisaient le goût et l’état d’esprit de la boisson. Cette
créativité a, je pense, influencé l’évolution de l’art graphique d’aujourd’hui.

Agenda du projet



La famille derrière la montre


Mon père, René Attias, a commencé la fabrication de montres en 1975. Il étaitconsidéré comme l'un des pionniers des montres ""fashion"".



Inspiré par son talent de créateur, je le rejoins à l'age de 24 ans. Dès lors, ilm'enseigne tout sur les montres..
..des règles de design à la fabrication, en passant par le prototypage, les tests etcontrôles qualités.

Notre famille possédait sa propre usine de boitiers de montre ainsi que sa propreunité d'assemblage, près de Besançon (la Franche Comté est une région connuepour son savoir-faire dans l'horlogerie, depuis des siècles) . Dans les années 80, lespremières montres à quartz révolutionnent l'industrie horlogère. Les usines françaises, qui ne fabriquaient à l'époque que des montres mécaniques, ferment une à une. La nôtre ne fera pas exception.Au début des années 90, nous transférons notre savoir-faire à Hong Kong, où nousdéveloppons des liens de partenariat avec les meilleurs fabricants de la région. Nous apprenons ainsi que le professionnalisme et l'exigence dépendent des hommes plus que des nationalités. Nous suivons de près les processus de fabrication, ne doutant pas que le plus grand soin sera apporté à la fabrication de nos montres.


Où sont fabriqué nos montres ?
Comme pour la majorité des marques horlogères, on ne peut pas fabriquer la totalité des composants d'une montre à partir de matériaux bruts. Un bon fabriquant de montre est en fait un maitre d'oeuvre, qui a constitué un réseau d'excellence avec des professionels compétants, experts dans l'art de fabriquer leurs composants. Ce réseau et ce savoir-faire ne peuvent s'improviser, et prennent des années à se construire. J'ai eu la chance d'hériter ceux-ci de mon père.Le design et le contrôle qualité final ont lieu à Paris, près du quartier des Arts etMétier, connu pour être un centre d'activité dynamique en horlogerie et enaccessoires de mode.

La fabrication du mouvement, le coeur de la montre, est pris en charge par notre patenaire de longue date au Japon, Miyota.



L'assemblage et la fabrication du boitier sont pris en charge par notre fournisseur et ami depuis de nombreuses années à Hong Kong.

Nous collaborons depuis très longtemps et je ne confierais nos montres à personned'autre que lui.The Team


Pourquoi votre soutien est si important.
L'idée du concept fun et décallé des montres en bouteilles est survenue après lacrise économique de 2008. Il devenait en effet nécessaire de se diversifier pourrester une fabrique de montre indépendante.



Aujourd'hui je souhaite, tout comme mon père avant moi, persévérer dans la
création et l’innovation. Cela nécessite d’importants investissements de recherche et de développement, qui poussent l’entreprise à réorienter sa stratégie vers de nouveaux modèles économiques.

<figure style=""margin: 0px;""><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">THE STORY</b></figure><p><b>I created The Perfect Cardigan because it's not always sunny in San Francisco...</b></p>
<p>      I flew from Sao Paulo, Brazil to San Francisco in February 2009 and re-discovered a lovely city filled with great art, amazing people and beautiful victorian houses, however I didn't realized it will be that cold...I had only visited San Francisco in the past during September and October, witch means summer here with temperature as high as 75°F (23 °C.).</p>
<p>So San Francisco is California, just a colder version of what I have imagined it to be! Most of the time it's in the 50s°F (10 °C). I didn't  know how to dress when in a single day I was experiencing pretty much 3 seasons...if not 4 ! Even on nice days the steep hills can change the weather pretty drastically after just few blocks. In fact, some hills can be quite windy all year round while at the bottom it can get pretty warm. In one neighborhood you can wear a t-shirt, but in another you may need...a cardigan.</p>
<p>Once in a while there are few heat waves, but these only happen a few times a year. On these strange occasions everywhere is t-shirt and flip-flop weather, like the California I had pictured in my mind... But don’t let this fool you. Once the evening fog rolls in you’ll be wishing for your cardigan and scarf again, so always be prepared.</p>
<p>      I remembered my sister's advice telling me to ""layer""...which I did ! I ended up wearing a lot of regular cardigans which most of the time did the job in keeping me warm but was either making me look way too young or way too old and ended up being boring...</p>
<p>I also tried wearing simple coats ! (the same ones that I wear in winter in Paris) again it did the job, I was warm but as the day went by, walking around the city, I kept on removing the coat, putting it back, removing it again, putting it back...and having to carry it all around was frustrating...</p>
<p>       My everyday outfits left me with the feeling that I was compromising style to stay warm...It was not fun to bundle myself up as if I was back in Montreal during fall...Annoying as well to carry a big coat around and overall too much effort into looking great just to cover it all as soon as I walked out the door ! </p>
<p>I remembered putting in a lot of effort into my ""Californian"" new way of dressing. Up ? Down ? Too warm ? Too light ? I needed to find a balance.</p>
<p> So I decided to create something I wish existed.</p>

<p>Many of our costumers have expressed the wish to see The Perfect Cardigan ready to wear in multiple colors ! We are now ready to respond to that demand and want to produce in cotton, bamboo + cotton, linen and wool but most importantly in different colors and sizes ! It may look like it could be a ""one size fits most"", but we beleive in sizes and want to give everybody something that works with their bodies.</p>
<p>Hopefully we'll reach our goal and if we go even beyond our goal, we'll be able to offer more colors ! Currently we are producing The Perfect Cardigan in black, ivory, grey and navy.</p>
<p> One day we are hoping to offer The Perfect Cardigan in every color of the rainbow !</p>

THE STORE
My store is called Aline's Closet.



101 Pierce Street, San Francisco
THE PROJECT 
My project is called the Perfect Cardigan.







THE STORYI created The Perfect Cardigan because it's not always sunny in San Francisco...
      I flew from Sao Paulo, Brazil to San Francisco in February 2009 and re-discovered a lovely city filled with great art, amazing people and beautiful victorian houses, however I didn't realized it will be that cold...I had only visited San Francisco in the past during September and October, witch means summer here with temperature as high as 75°F (23 °C.).
So San Francisco is California, just a colder version of what I have imagined it to be! Most of the time it's in the 50s°F (10 °C). I didn't  know how to dress when in a single day I was experiencing pretty much 3 seasons...if not 4 ! Even on nice days the steep hills can change the weather pretty drastically after just few blocks. In fact, some hills can be quite windy all year round while at the bottom it can get pretty warm. In one neighborhood you can wear a t-shirt, but in another you may need...a cardigan.
Once in a while there are few heat waves, but these only happen a few times a year. On these strange occasions everywhere is t-shirt and flip-flop weather, like the California I had pictured in my mind... But don’t let this fool you. Once the evening fog rolls in you’ll be wishing for your cardigan and scarf again, so always be prepared.
      I remembered my sister's advice telling me to ""layer""...which I did ! I ended up wearing a lot of regular cardigans which most of the time did the job in keeping me warm but was either making me look way too young or way too old and ended up being boring...
I also tried wearing simple coats ! (the same ones that I wear in winter in Paris) again it did the job, I was warm but as the day went by, walking around the city, I kept on removing the coat, putting it back, removing it again, putting it back...and having to carry it all around was frustrating...
       My everyday outfits left me with the feeling that I was compromising style to stay warm...It was not fun to bundle myself up as if I was back in Montreal during fall...Annoying as well to carry a big coat around and overall too much effort into looking great just to cover it all as soon as I walked out the door ! 
I remembered putting in a lot of effort into my ""Californian"" new way of dressing. Up ? Down ? Too warm ? Too light ? I needed to find a balance.
 So I decided to create something I wish existed.


The first prototype of The Perfect Cardigan came into life in 2012.

""moulage"" on Viviane looking for the 1st proportions
Since then, I work with my seamstress Olga, right at the store and we have made 10 prototypes of The Perfect Cardigan, in different fabrics, length, finitions and functionality options.








THE STYLE
The Perfect Cardigan is a classic idea with a twist ! 
So it's not just a cardigan. It falls beautifully almost like if a crop top meets a draped dress, pull it over your head or...Completely flip it upside down and create a pick a boo back, (remember we want to show our outfit !)


 It also transforms into a complete new piece depending on how you pin it... 


 belt it...


 or play with it !


As a shawl it will lay on your shoulders and if it gets misty or windy the excess fabric is the perfect hoodie to cover up your hair! Et Voilà ! 
Convertible Playful Effortlessly Chic
Every woman should have a few statement items in her collection, and The Perfect Cardigan is the perfect piece item to own! Not only is this piece extremely versatile, but it will keep you warm when the wind suddenly picks up and is also going to compliment any look.
During the daytime, If you opt to wear The Perfect Cardigan with a white tee shirt.


Over a floral dress, for a ladylike look.


 In silk + leather used as a lovely and stylish wrap.




For nursing moms it's the ideal cover up and The Perfect Cardigan will reveal, pregnant or not, the super stylish woman in you !  No effort necessary...


And as soon as our indian summer comes out linen is my favorite !


I believe you deserve to put a face to the maker of your purchases. On the picture right above it's me looking at my master piece. Below it's my seamstress Olga and I, after a day at the store.


I hope you will enjoy The Perfect Cardigan as much as we do.
WHY KICKSTARTER ?
We cut according to every clients measurements and requirements right at the store. They get to select the fabric and take part of the design process. It's a lot of fun and the experience is as unique as the piece they get!
We have cut and sewn more than 200 Perfect Cardigans on a custom made basis right at the store and made 200 happy costumers ! 





















WE WOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO A DEMAND
Many of our costumers have expressed the wish to see The Perfect Cardigan ready to wear in multiple colors ! We are now ready to respond to that demand and want to produce in cotton, bamboo + cotton, linen and wool but most importantly in different colors and sizes ! It may look like it could be a ""one size fits most"", but we beleive in sizes and want to give everybody something that works with their bodies.
Hopefully we'll reach our goal and if we go even beyond our goal, we'll be able to offer more colors ! Currently we are producing The Perfect Cardigan in black, ivory, grey and navy.
 One day we are hoping to offer The Perfect Cardigan in every color of the rainbow !

Our first ready to wear production was a success !
The Perfect Cardigan came into 95 pieces of one fabric (bamboo + cotton blend) in 2 colors (charcoal grey+ black) sold in stores in San Francisco and shipped in the USA, Canada and Europe.

Plan Watches are back with the new watch series called Genoa. Our timepieces are even more interesting, complicated, conceptual and simply better in every aspect now! We're currently preparing for the production stage, so you don't need to wait for the campaign to end — we're going to start shipping this November (or even earlier, as we're expecting)! So now's the best chance to get the Genoa watch with the huge discount and don't wait extra time as well.       Our first campaign attracted a lot of backers and made us believe that there are people out there, all over the world, who are interested in the watches produced by our team. After a successful beginning, we were inspired to move further and started working on a new series called Genoa.The primary sources of inspiration for the Genoa series are retro dashboards of vintage scooters from the middle of the 20th century, the period of their rise to glory, the time of leisure living, easygoing and upbeat youth finding their stand in views, life and, of course, incredible style.Our debut Edmonton series attracted a significant portion of attention, with people supporting us during and after the campaign. We have plenty of customers in every corner of the globe and both design and watch-oriented media. Now, we're sure that our Genoa series is more interesting in concept, has better looks, and you'll love it even more than our Edmonton watch. Plan Watches have a quirk for vintage-inspired timepieces. Our previous project drew inspiration from luxury timepieces of the first part of the 20th century combined with the sophistication of a preppy style. The Genoa series still reaches back to this period but takes its design from an entirely new inspiration.The Genoa collection's look is based on several distinctive design features which reflect different retro aspects, assembling into one piece of ultimate retro manifestation.The main source of inspiration for this series are dashboards and measurement tools from vintage scooters which were produced by such prominent brands and factories as Piaggio, Lambretta, and Cushman. The dials bear resemblance with Vespa and Lambretta scooter dashboard elements, as well as in overall aesthetics with a love of details, which is our signature. :)The shape of the watch case and the dial both resemble typical rounded measurement tools of vintage scooter vehicles.The layout on the dial also serves as an homage. The date window not only refers to a mileage counter but also has retro type applied to the disc. On the bottom of the face of the watch lies an extra 24-hour dial (which can also be used as a dual time function — perfect for travelling!) with the shape and hand referring to vintage speedometers, and the red color of the hand is typical to the dashboards of the middle of the 20th century.Each watch, traditionally, comes with two straps. One is of perforated leather which is standard for retro automotive watches. The other is a textile strap resembling a livery and the paintwork of specific old scooter models.Every time we start creating the watch, we want it not only to find inspiration in different cultures and stylistics, but also, to bring this aesthetic into the personal style of its wearer. That's why we always choose something interesting, unexplored, and challenging. This time we want to express in our design a very interesting blend of attractive retro vehicle design of the middle of the 20th century with notes of Art Deco elegance, a portion of easygoing Italian lifestyle, and the incredibly stylish boldness of British Mod culture.Each part of the Genoa watch is created with love for details and sources of inspiration. The watch will become a precious addition to any wardrobe and a worthy decoration to every wrist.

<h3>What is The Project? </h3>
<p>Hi! my name is Rebecca Jansen, I am fashion business student who always interested in any eco-friendly and handcrafted things. </p>
<p>I am introducing WOODECO, eco-friendly wooden watch with a fashionable and unique design for both male and female. Presenting the finest results of the natural wealth that had been wasted to become a new fashion accessory with least impact on our environment.  </p>
<p>Started from a big number of factories and household production of wood-based that generate so much wood waste that actually still can be utilized. Using the materials efficiently and effectively is the keyword of this project. </p>
<p>We collect the remaining timber that has been selected to the craftsman in Indonesia to do the production. Indonesia is popular with its traditional art and culture. Wooden craving is one of their art forms of culture in this developing country. It still widely becomes a livelihood job for local people in some provinces. By partnering with artisans in Indonesia, we support the art communities and their creativity to grow in a better economic condition. </p>

<p>Our goal is to be a better sustainable product that may reduce the environmental pollution and slowly bring good impact for our environment and develop creative art products by artisans to become wider, so then people can get to know more about the process behind a handcrafted product. </p>

<p>We generated the idea into a fashion accessory, a wooden watch that comes with a unisex design for both male and female. it is made from the finest wood that from the wood workshop, furniture production, and some is from local carpenter as well.</p>

<p>The funds would be mostly used for the marketing campaigns and its promotion, so then it would increase the awareness of the product and get wider people to know more about a sustainable product. In addition, every fund that has been used would be informed to our contributors and if the funds were more than the stated goal, I would use the additional funds to support artisans in order to develop their creativity. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As this is a handcrafted product, the main challenge and risk are managing the consistency of the product production. Recognising this, we’ve partnered up with more artisans to handle various situations that can hamper the production process.</p>

We love to get dressed up to go out but our styles always clash, so people wonder how we're related or how we get a long so well. That's what inspired this clothing line, to show how opposites do attract while they can sometimes repel. I wanna create this brand, Rebel the Rebel, as a way to unify people and their choice of fashion, because too many people get excluded just by the way they dress.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>Now most people know that creating a clothing line just doesn't happen over night, and being fresh out of high school and in college means I don't have a lot of money. What this campaign will do is fund all the supplies and materials I will need to make my first batch of designs. I've posted more images to show that not only will Rebel the Rebel be apparel, but jewelry as well, I am very into metal working. I considered $500 to be a good start, as I will be selling these clothes on etsy and hopefully be able to make profit to make my brand grow.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>I feel that too many times kids, teens, and even adults get excluded by the way that they dress or present themselves. Rebel the Rebel has a way of allowing self expression while also passing that border to allow open communication amongst different type of people. Everyone gets judged at first glance, but with the right style, you can allow for that door to stay open, even if it's just a crack. <br/>Rebel the Rebel will also have clothes that will favor one extreme over another, so when a store opens up, shoppers don't have to think ""That store isn't my taste/That isn't for me"", they can walk in and step next to someone who looks completely different from them. The opposites will attract to the same place. <br/>I also hope that if Rebel the Rebel can become something, that I can donate money to help fund anti-bullying campaigns. <br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>I don't expect for people to right away get on this idea, but I hope to be as persuasive as possible. I've been dying to create my own business one day, and being an entrepreneur is in my bones. If this fund fails, I will still trying to create Rebel the Rebel as best as I can, because as they say; the show must go on!<br/>I don't expect any of this to be a cake walk if I do get the funding though, I am going to create a LinkedIn account to get talking to manufactures or other investors to get Rebel the Rebel started. This is my dream.<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Even If you can't donate any money, it would help me the most if you would like my facebook page for Rebel the Rebel <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/RebeltheRebel"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a>. My <a href=""https://www.etsy.com/shop/RebeltheRebel?ref=hdr_shop_menu"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">etsy shop</a> also has one time available for purchase so far in case you are interested to direct start getting the snow ball rolling.<br/>And pass this on to anyone who loves fashion or would be interested in this idea and would want to fund it. <br/>Help someone who just wants to bring people together in the name of fashion. To end bullying or feeling left out just because of what they wear.<br/>

While you can't escape it till the next vacation, you might as well live well in the moment. Take control back with VITALI. We've integrated fabric sensors around the upper torso into a stylish bra to track and monitor your breathing, posture and heart rate variability. The Smart Bra is built with 4 skin-friendly fabric sensors that track your breathing and HRV, with higher accuracy than traditional wrist-based wearables. It has two colours and two closure systems to choose from, body-tested for comfort and support with women ranging from size 30AA to 40DD. 
 The GEM is the mind behind VITALI. The powerful processor collects data from all sensors to understand your pattern to give you bio-feedback by gentle taps. When your body reacts, GEM notices it immediately.  The idea for VITALI first came from yoga. Good breathing and posture are not only vital to the practice, but also everyday wellbeing. With biofeedback, we are bring the benefit of yoga into everyday healthy habits, so you feel zen regardless what you do. When VITALI notices signs of imbalance it guides you to take action by breathing deeply, then breathe to your hearts natural rhythms. Doing so can help you take control at the right time, every time. Good breathing doesn't happen without good posture. VITALI has got your back, no matter how many hours you have to work, stand or drive. See how your breath quality improve with posture.  Whatever you do to stay well, VITALI integrates easily into your existing mindfulness practice. The My VITALI app tracks your practice and shows the exact before and after effect. Whether you use it to see how your meditation session went or for a guided breathing exercise, you are in good hands!  VITALI goes whenever you are, and doesn't need your smart phone to work. Take a personalized breathing exercise is just as simple as getting dressed. Overtime we can effectively train our natural stress response to be more resilient, even you are not wearing it!   HRV (Heart Rate Variability) is a key physiological indicator of stress. When we start to get stressed, our HRV changes pattern. The GEM captures that pattern and reminds you at the right time, every time, to prevent you from stress.  VITALI coaches you to breathe in sync with your heart's natural rhythm. Doing so puts your mind and body in tune. In order to guide you to breathe, we have to correct your posture first: a sedentary lifestyle greatly affects our posture and the quality of our breath. No matter what you do, working, walking or driving, whenever you are slouched over, it's hard to take a deep breath. The GEM reminds you to maintain good posture, so you are ready to take a deep breath when you need!     Not sure what size to get? Measure the band first (the area directly under your bust). Make sure measuring tape is level and snug to get the best read. This reading is your band size, which is the top row of the chart. Next measure the bust (the fullest part of your chest). The different between the band and the bust measurement is your cup size. 1'' difference: A cup, 2'' difference: B cup, 3'' difference: C cup, etc.We know our backers don't have a chance to try on VITALI before pledging, so we want you to have a peace of mind. It's simple, try it on at home, if you think you could use a different size, ship it back to us and we will make it right!

Hello everyone! Thank you for stopping by in our ETHICAL STEPS project by The Andes Fashion® 
My name is Mirta Evi,  I'm a sustainable fashion designer from Ecuador specialize in natural materials resources, creating new and unique designs, all handmade by our very skilled artisans from Amazon Rainforest communities and panama hats weavers communities from Ecuador. One of our goals at moment of creating a product, is to preserve the identity of Ecuador, but at same time create a fashionable product, so easy to carry and wear in any place of the world, creating new eco trends!
Beside these activities, I have a full time job as mom, very proud of my 2 lovely boys, also a singer, artist, illustrator and I give consultancy for sustainable material projects & handcrafts apply into the fashion business. We have been working for international organizations as the UNDP (United National Development Programme) for Tokyo, Japan and Quito, Ecuador offices.









                                              


   Waorani women weaving chambira bags, jewellery and shoes in our  training workshop in Coca city, Ecuador.


Waorani woman with typical feather and bejuco (lianas) crown, preparing the chambira fiber to become threads, this must be done before start to weave any product. Children go with their mothers and learn how to weave since a very early age.

Waorani women making the threads. At below, chambira fiber drying under the sun.  With more sunlight, the chambira become whiter. At right, final product AMAZON    CHAMBIRA SANDALS in natural and brown color



The ETHICAL STEPS idea began when I had one of the best experiences in my life, working with the WAORANI COMMUNITY. They live far away from the cities in Ecuador, deep in the Amazon Rainforest, more exact at the YASUNI NATIONAL PARK.  

Amazing PROMO VIDEO about Yasuni ITT , Waorani territory in Ecuador and why is so important to preserve the nature in it and the cultures that live in it.
  

Simply the idea to work with these fantastic group of women (there are more than 1000 weavers in Azuay province and 450 families of Waorani community) made me think of how can we develop a new product never done before, preserving their ancestral technics, but in the application of something different from a hat or jewellery?. We all in the communities (near to Cuenca and Puyo) and at the brand started to give ideas, back and forward... and then... Bingo! the answer was at our own feet! and then the ETHICAL STEPS born. 
Being a shoes lover, but above all, an eco-fashion and fair trade defender, made me decide to start this iniciative with all these amazing women in their amazon and high mountain communities.


Here we are working for the UNDP, THE ANDES FASHION and MUJI STORES JAPAN new product development of Chambira bags project in our first workshop. Yasuni, Ecuador

Panama hats weavers, they also weave our ""planchas"" which is a long and solid piece made of toquilla straw to create our ETHICAL STEPS. Toquilla straw drying under the sun, and toquilla weaver choosing the straw to create a new hat, at the below photos. 
  

      


These are enough reasons to help us to change our women's lives and empowering their communities!
With ETHICAL STEPS we empowering women to have a stronger position in our society, to generate better opportunities to their communities, to be a better support of their families and make them feel proud about their skills and cultural heritage identity!

We want to offer you an alternative you can get behind in order to make the world a better place through several principles:It is costly for the people, for the earth, and it always benefits the same group of very rich people. While we started thinking about how to change this way of life, the idea of creating t-shirts came to us. It is a very democratic and unisex piece of clothing unlike suits.We wanted to create more than just plain white t-shirts. They had to display amazing  and powerful designs with deeply meaningful messages. They also had to be “beautifully” and ethically made using innovative and sustainable production technologies.We started thinking that together we could change the world one shirt at a time, and it was already a really great start.Paradigm Shirt was created in 2017, and is on a mission to change the second most polluting industry.We selected 9 world-changing non-profits to partner with. Together we found a quote that deeply resonated with their cause. Then we collaborated with super talented designers to illustrate the quote. Each design was made in 3 different versions and we asked you guys to vote for you favorite one!Did you know that the people who make the clothes sold in fast fashion receive only between 0,5% and 3% of the clothes price? That means when a worker makes a 20€ t-shirt they are paid between 0,1€ and 0,6€, and we are not even talking about children labour. This has to stop.At Paradigm Shirt we care about the people and the environment that is why our production is 100% ethical and eco-friendly.Everything is sourced and produced in Japan, from raw material to finished product for a minimized carbon footprint. Japaneses have been mastering the fabric production for centuries and it made sense to appeal to their knowledge to create our textile. It also guarantees us and you humane labor practices for all the happy workers (no psychedelics involved, promise).To keep bottles out of landfills we recycle and transform them into polyester and use it as fabric for our garments. It limits soil contamination, air, and water pollution.Polyester from recycled plastic bottles can be indefinitely recycled without no degradation of quality. So it means you can buy a t-shirt that will last a lifetime!We decided to use an innovative, and sustainable waterless dyeing technique: the Airdye Technology. It is as futuristic as it sounds.With traditional dyeing method “If a customer needs 300m but the dyeing machine needs 500m to get the right colour, so you are always producing things that are not necessary.” Hani Debs Managing Director and Vice President of Debs Textile Corporation.The Airdye production system enables production from a few meters without any compromise on quality. It can print and dye with a single pass through AirDye machines. No pre-processes are necessary, eliminating a lot of time and waste in production. By using air instead of water to convey dyes, no hazardous waste is emitted, and no water is wasted.After working in the entertainment industry for a few years, our CEO, Alexandre Coissard decided to do something that was really aligned with his values and life purpose.He is from that tribe of social entrepreneurs.

<p><strong>The Kool-Z Is A New Way to Drink From A Can.</strong> Our goal is for YOU to get maximum enjoyment from your beverage. The Kool-Z has been designed to lock in your drinks icy temperature, keeping it colder, longer. The Kool-Z is double-wall insulated, completely enclosing any standard 12oz can like a wet suit - snugly.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>We’ve Taken Care To Look At Every Detail Meticulously.</strong> The Kool-Z is designed to be sleek yet rugged, with a clear outer skin and a black lid that seals your beverage shut. We’ve also made sure that your beverage “drinks” smoothly. Drinking from the Kool-Z is an awesome experience – the liquid flows effortlessly and the spout is designed for chugging!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Kool-Z Is Different.</strong> The Kool-Z is like a regular can ""koozie""... on steroids. Those old koozies are so 1996. They are flimsy and cheap and never really got the job done. We have done our best to design the Kool-Z to be fresh and functional.</p>

<p><strong>1. You Drink Directly From The Kool-Z…Not From A Dirty, Dusty Can. </strong>Beverage factories, shipping crates and store shelves aren’t exactly sanitary. The Kool-Z makes it so you’ll never have to touch your lips to dusty cans again.  Can rims are dirty - they accumulate debris, and germs.  Sometimes you can even taste the dust.  We think that’s just gross. And by the way, the Kool-Z is 100% BPA Free so it's safe to use.</p>

<p><strong>2.
