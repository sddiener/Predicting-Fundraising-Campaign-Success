<p>Two days before New Years, a pack of five friends—three men

<p>From <a href=""http://www.twodollarradio.com/main.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Two Dollar Radio</a>’s jacket copy:</p>
<p><b>“With some of the most luminous and purple prose flexed in

grand, episodic debut, redolent of the stark conscience of Denis Johnson and
the spellbinding vision of Roberto Bolaño.”</b></p>
<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What they're saying about <i>Made to Break</i>
</h3>
<p>“D. Foy’s writing is
so rich, so saturated in both life and literature, that one is tempted to
strain for comparison, to find whatever madcap equivalencies (“It’s X meets
Y!”) might begin to describe it accurately. Yet its whorl and grain, <b>the
fantastical strangeness of Foy’s sentences and the astonishing accuracy of his
perception</b>, amounts to something I can only call new. <b><i>Made To Break</i> is
that rare thing: a truly original, and ferociously necessary, book.</b>”<br/>          —<span><b><span>Matthew Specktor</span></b>, author of <i><span>American Dream Machine</span></i></span></p>
<p>“D. Foy’s <i>Made to
Break</i> is a fiercely engrossing story of isolation, decaying friendships,
and what people are capable of when they become, in body and in soul, trapped,
all set against a dangerous winter landscape. <b>These characters are so richly
alive, these sentences so stormy and beautiful, this novel reads less like a
debut than an assured, indelible work of art.</b>”<br/>          —<span><b><span>Laura van den Berg</span></b>, author of <i><span>The Isle of Youth</span></i></span></p>
<p>“<i>Made to Break</i>
is a fearless exploration of fragility–the fragility of friendship, the
fragility of romance, the fragility of human life–but t<b>he book itself, trussed
by D. Foy’s lavishly constructed sentences and astute psychological
observations, is built to last. </b>Think: Celine. Think: Burroughs. Think: Denis
Johnson. Or better yet, think: D. Foy, poet laureate-elect of that marginal
America filled with  junkies and drunks, where death is omnipresent, and
the refuge of an open diner on a stormy night is the closest one gets to the
American Dream.”<br/>          —<span><b><span>Adam Wilson</span></b>, author of <i><span>Flatscreen</span></i> and <i><span>What’s Important Is Feeling</span></i></span></p>
<p>“<b>Stand back—D. Foy
has ignited a big bad bacchanal where the sentences—if not whole pages—sear
your skull.</b> And buckle up, too, because the characters in <i>Made to Break</i>
don’t. Here is a novel to cheer and to foist upon others.”<br/>          —<span><b><span>Terese Svoboda</span></b> </span>author of <span><span><i>Tin God</i></span>, <span><i>Black Glasses Like Clark Kent</i></span>, <span><i>Bohemian Girl</i></span></span></p>
<p>“While reading <i>Made
to Break</i> I just couldn’t believe it was the author’s first novel. The
characters are deadly, troubled, vibrant, and their world is suffused with
evil—not the manufactured evil of a Hollywood horror movie, but the carefully
paced malevolence of a world doomed to swallow its inhabitants, consuming their
shallow, fucked up memories in a swell of amoral darkness. <b>D. Foy is not just a
writer. He’s the kind of archangel Stanley Kubrick would have built wings for.
Don’t just read this book. Revel in it. I swear you won’t be able to stop.</b>”<br/>          —<span><b><span>Samuel Sattin</span></b>, author of <i><span>League of Somebodies</span></i></span></p>
<p>“<b><i>Made to Break</i>
is a debauched <i>Decameron</i> for the punk and pills age.</b> The group of
friends in this excellent debut novel hit bottom together, and hit it hard. D.
Foy sets his characters in motion and sends them reeling, one sure hand on the
reader’s throat in a gorgeous, exhilarating tumble.”<br/><b>          </b>—<span></span><b><span>Cari Luna</span></b>, author of <span><i>The Revolution of Every Day</i></span></p>
<p>“<b>If Jonathan Ames,
David Lynch, and Jack Kerouac banded together to pen a cautionary tale</b> about
Peter Pan and his drug- and alcohol-addled Lost Boys-as-Donner Party refugees,
<b>it would look like <i>Made to Break</i>.</b> In D. Foy’s hands, men and women
too old to behave like the impetuous teens they once were still cling to the
dying code of what made their youth survivable.  <b>This book is one wild,
wild ride.</b>”<br/>          —<span><span><b>Christian Kiefer</b>,</span> </span>author of <span><span><i>The Infinite Tide</i></span></span></p>
<h3>The tour<br/>
</h3><p>
</p><p>The official launch date for <i><span>Made to Break</span></i> is <b>March 18</b><i>,</i> but I’ll be
kicking off my national tour starting with <b><span>AWP Seattle</span></b> on <b>February 26</b>, where I’ll read
with <b>Jeff Jackson</b> (<i><span>Mira Corpora</span></i>), <b>Matt Bell</b> (<i><span>In the House Upon the Dirt Between the Lake and the Woods</span></i>),
<b>Sean Madigan Hoen</b> (<i><span>Songs Only You Know</span></i>), and that great insurgent
siren, <b>Cari Luna</b> (<i><span>The Revolution of Everyday</span></i>). This event is sponsored by <a href=""http://www.twodollarradio.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Two Dollar Radio</a>, Soho Press, <a href=""http://www.bookforum.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bookforum Magazine</a> magazine. I'll also do two other gigs at AWP with a giant crew from <a href=""http://lazyfascistpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Lazy Fascist Press</a> (and others). You can see the full slate of venues and writers for all of the Seattle events <a href=""http://dfoyble.com/?page_id=1300"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. <br/></p>
<p>As for Cari Luna: immediately following the lollapalooza
that is AWP, she and I are going to do a Bonnie-and-Clyde on the
northwest, taking the region by storm. The itinerary will include <b>Bellingham</b>,
WA, <b>Vancouver</b> BC, <b>Olympia</b>, WA, and <b>Portland</b>, OR, at
Powell’s. More details are forthcoming on these, too. We can assure you,
however, that the ride will include videos, goofy or otherwise, podcasts, radio
shows, and blog entries, then—in all likelihood—a joint, post-recovery,
tell-all essay about our adventures. I'll also be blogging about my adventures once a week over at <b>Electric Literature's</b> site <a href=""http://electricliterature.com/blog/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Outlet</a>.<br/></p>
<p>While Cari may be headed back home after all of that fun,
however, I’ll only be getting started. From Portland, I’ll roll into the <b>Bay
Area</b>, where the ass-kicking <b>Joshua Mohr</b> (<i><span>Damascus</span></i> and others.) and I will appear “in conversation” at San
Francisco’s famed <b>City Lights Books</b>. I’ll do the same with <b>Samuel Sattin</b> at <b>Green Apple Books</b> in SF and with <b>Christian Kiefer</b> at <b>Books Inc.</b>
in <b>Alameda</b>, as well. After these appearances, I head to the <span>Kreuzberg Cafe</span> in <b>San Luis Obispo</b>, an
oasis on Cali’s central coast and the town of my conception, and from there to <b>LA</b>
to rock it out at two different events, one in conversation with God of Letters
<b>Matthew Specktor</b> (<span>American Dream Machine</span>) and another with a
couple of Two Dollar Radio’s living legends, <b>Grace Krilanovich</b> and <b>Karolina
Waclawiak</b>.</p>
<p>At home in NYC for two days, I’ll be joined by <b>Anthony Swofford</b>
for a talk/reading/Q&amp;A/signing at SoHo’s <b>McNally Jackson Books</b>,
followed by a racous sort of event with <span>Paula Bomer</span> and <span>Sean H. Doyle</span> at Brooklyn’s own <b>BookCourt</b>,
hosted by the boys from <i><b><span>Vol. 1 Brooklyn</span></b></i>, <b>Jason Diamond</b> and <b>Tobias
Carroll</b>.</p>
<p>From Brooklyn, I head straight to <b>Philadelphia</b> and from
there to <b>Richmond</b> and a number of events in <b>North Carolina</b>. <b>Columbus</b>, OH
(hometown of Two Dollar Radio) is the first town I'll hit in the Midwest, followed by <b>Cleveland</b>, <b>Ann Arbor</b>, <b>Chicago</b>, <b>Minneapolis</b>, and <b>Iowa City</b>. After these, I head to <b>Washington, D.C.</b> for a literary conference and reading at <b>Three Tents Reading Series</b>. <br/></p>
<p>Back at the ranch again on <b>April 7</b>, I’ll read at the now
world-famous <b><span>Franklin Park Reading Series</span></b>, hosted by <b>Penina

Made to Break, the novel

Made to Break
recently made Flavorwire’s 15 Most Anticipated Books of 2014, and Anthony Swofford says, “Reading D. Foy's prose
is like watching Robert Stone and Wallace Stevens drag race across a frozen
lake at midnight.”
Two days before New Years, a pack of five friends—three men
and two women—head to a remote cabin near Lake Tahoe to celebrate the holidays.
They've been buddies forever, banded together by scrapes and squalor, their
relationships defined by these wild times.
After a car accident leaves one friend sick and dying, and
severe weather traps them at the cabin, there is nowhere to go, forcing them to
finally and ultimately take stock and confront their past transgressions,
considering what they mean to one another and to themselves.
From Two Dollar Radio’s jacket copy:
“With some of the most luminous and purple prose flexed in
recent memory, D. Foy is an incendiary new voice and Made to Break, a
grand, episodic debut, redolent of the stark conscience of Denis Johnson and
the spellbinding vision of Roberto Bolaño.”
What they're saying about Made to Break

“D. Foy’s writing is
so rich, so saturated in both life and literature, that one is tempted to
strain for comparison, to find whatever madcap equivalencies (“It’s X meets
Y!”) might begin to describe it accurately. Yet its whorl and grain, the
fantastical strangeness of Foy’s sentences and the astonishing accuracy of his
perception, amounts to something I can only call new. Made To Break is
that rare thing: a truly original, and ferociously necessary, book.”          —Matthew Specktor, author of American Dream Machine
“D. Foy’s Made to
Break is a fiercely engrossing story of isolation, decaying friendships,
and what people are capable of when they become, in body and in soul, trapped,
all set against a dangerous winter landscape. These characters are so richly
alive, these sentences so stormy and beautiful, this novel reads less like a
debut than an assured, indelible work of art.”          —Laura van den Berg, author of The Isle of Youth
“Made to Break
is a fearless exploration of fragility–the fragility of friendship, the

America filled with  junkies and drunks, where death is omnipresent, and
the refuge of an open diner on a stormy night is the closest one gets to the
American Dream.”          —Adam Wilson, author of Flatscreen and What’s Important Is Feeling
“Stand back—D. Foy
has ignited a big bad bacchanal where the sentences—if not whole pages—sear
your skull. And buckle up, too, because the characters in Made to Break
don’t. Here is a novel to cheer and to foist upon others.”          —Terese Svoboda author of Tin God, Black Glasses Like Clark Kent, Bohemian Girl

<h3>Story of My Book </h3>
<p><i>The Long Way Home</i> is a never-ending quest to find the most balanced, happy, imperfect version of yourself. This book will inspire readers toward bridging the gap between societal pressures and choosing their own path in life.<br/><br/>My name is Rachel Riccobono and I am the author of <i>The Long Way Home</i>. I wrote this book because I’m passionate about personal development and human connection. I’m a lifelong learner; constantly searching for the answers to life’s mysteries and most asked questions. I may have the wisdom of an old soul, but I’m looking at life with a fresh pair of eyes. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover your most authentic self, and learn how to care for yourself mentally, physically, and emotionally. I hope you choose to look past the unrealistic standards and pressures that society places on you. <i>The Long Way Home </i>will encourage readers to choose paths that serve them, rather than ones that please those around them. <br/><br/>In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for personal growth. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you find more balance, gain a better understanding of yourself and others around you, and use your passions to find your niche along this messy, confusing journey of life. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about topics like growth mindset, healthy boundaries, life purpose, trauma, and coping. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>My journey to now; a deeper look inside my personal growth, from passionate child to an ambitious woman conquering adulthood and her autoimmune disease. </li>
<li>Insights from extraordinary individuals like the Wright Brothers, Audrey Hepburn, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. </li>
<li>Inspiring stories and wisdom from experts, creators, and speakers like Spencer Harrison and Jon Cohen, Bob Borchers, Tim Tamashiro, and Susan David.</li>

<p> </p>
<p>You will love this book if you are open-minded, value self-improvement, and enjoy learning new things.<br/><br/><i>The Long Way Home</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to readers everywhere, from adolescents to adults.

<p><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the prologue + chapters 1-4.<br/>A journey has to start somewhere! In this first section, readers will learn more about different generations of people in the United States, current issues we face in this technological age, how to stay curious, and how to identify their primary needs. These chapters will dive deep into societal pressures, unconventional routes to success, and straying from the pack. Part 1 will include research and insights from Pew Research Center, TIME Magazine, Walt Disney, Albert Einstein, Abraham Maslow, Mayo Clinic, and much more. This section will embrace ideals of originality, reminding readers that there’s no “right way” to live their life or achieve greatness in this world. <br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 5-7. <br/>In this section, readers will learn how to create healthy boundaries in relationships, cope with trauma, and embrace the never-ending struggle to find balance.

<p>My name is Dallas Freeman. I am a woman whose history is filled with abuse, depression and addiction. I was bullied, neglected and rejected, forced out of my home before I could even drive. I tried to cope with it all which led to my own addiction, sexual promiscuity, and even an abortion. </p>
<p>When I was 22 I came to a place where I wanted to die. I couldn’t handle my reality anymore. In the middle of all of that mess, I learned who God was and what it meant to have a relationship with Him and it was life changing for me.</p>
<p>Overcoming my personal battle with addiction and abuse and now living a life on purpose is something I want to share with others who are struggling with those same issues. My hope is to show them that someone who has been where they are has found a real way out and up through the power of Jesus Christ. I want to give them hope that they too can overcome and gain a purpose worth living for even in the aftermath of their own bad decisions. </p>
<p>By contributing to this project you will help get my story into the hands of people who need to be encouraged to keep fighting, and who need to see there is an amazing life beyond abuse and addiction. </p>

</div></div>","My name is Dallas Freeman. I am a woman whose history is filled with abuse, depression and addiction. I was bullied, neglected and rejected, forced out of my home before I could even drive. I tried to cope with it all which led to my own addiction, sexual promiscuity, and even an abortion. 
When I was 22 I came to a place where I wanted to die. I couldn’t handle my reality anymore. In the middle of all of that mess, I learned who God was and what it meant to have a relationship with Him and it was life changing for me.
Overcoming my personal battle with addiction and abuse and now living a life on purpose is something I want to share with others who are struggling with those same issues. My hope is to show them that someone who has been where they are has found a real way out and up through the power of Jesus Christ. I want to give them hope that they too can overcome and gain a purpose worth living for even in the aftermath of their own bad decisions. 
By contributing to this project you will help get my story into the hands of people who need to be encouraged to keep fighting, and who need to see there is an amazing life beyond abuse and addiction.

I wrote this book because after years of observing, working with, and studying people who achieved stratospheric success, I wanted to share what I discovered was that catalyst and most important key to their achievement – without fail, 100% of them either had an apprenticeship relationship and/or an apprentice mindset. I then decided to take a deeper dive and explore their stories, the notion of apprenticeships, and how since the beginning of time apprenticeships have been the key to unlocking potential and helping humanity find purpose and success.  </p><p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will become inspired and motivated by the stories of well-known and not so-well-known individuals who deliberately sought out and/or submitted themselves to the masters of their fields. And because iron sharpens iron, these apprentices discovered, honed, and developed their potential to a point where they achieved mastery and went on to make significant contributions in their industries, society, and the world. In this book, I hope to share with you the same sort of passion and excitement that I found in learning more about the master/apprentice pairs presented. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you realize that purpose, mastery, and success are not solely discovered through an internal introspective process but also by taking on the mindset of an apprentice and placing oneself in the orbit of a master. A well-developed internal compass is not always the primary key to finding your way in life. Taking a journey with experienced masters will guide you toward finding your own path toward destiny and success.</p><p>In this book, you'll learn about how apprenticeships lead to the acquisition of tacit knowledge and mastery through observation, imitation, and eventually finding one’s voice and way.    You'll hear stories such as...</p><ul>
<li>How Jamie Dimon’s decision to turn down offers from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Lehman Brothers to apprentice Sandy Weill when he was President at American Express gave Dimon the opportunity to learn how to successfully manage billion-dollar mergers and acquisitions fresh out of Harvard Business School.</li>
<li>How Congressman Charlie Rangel and the first-ever US Trade Representative for Africa Rosa Whitaker were two of the key architects of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), the cornerstone of the United States’ trade policy with Africa. Whitaker worked with Congressman Rangel and learned how relationship building, negotiation, and consensus building are key to getting tough things done.</li>
<li>Cellists Pablo Casals and Bernard Greenhouse and how apprenticeships among top musicians is a lesson in how imitation can lead to improvisation and innovation.</li>
</ul><p>You will also hear stories of how:</p><ul>
<li>An ocean enthusiast apprenticed his father to become one of the top dive instructors and foremost experts on marine conservation.</li>
<li>A church’s protégé program became the ultimate apprenticeship model for creating a pipeline of leaders to drive the expansion of its programs in Washington, DC.</li>

<p>The first is a series of 5 picture books for infants &amp; toddlers (birth to age 4) that center on two honeybees who visit local creatures . Two of these books are already written and currently being illustrated.</p>

What We Need & What You Get
In order to make these books accessible to all children and schools, we need funding to cover some of the bigger expenses such as graphic design & editing, marketing & publicity, and most of all, the printing & distribution. 

The Impact

My books help fill a niche that allows for nature connection to be touched upon even when stuck inside during inclement weather. These stories also promote literacy & language development and social & emotional intelligence.

Risks & Challenges

I also have a store on etsy.com, Sylvan Arts & Crafts, where i sell nature-inspired arts & crafts.
I am also open to any & all referrals, connections, and feedback.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>This project is an anthology of short stories by several different writers in a brand new genre of modern fantasy that rejects the tropes and cliches of the Urban Fantasy genre.</p>
<p>By helping me, you're helping several writers. The world doesn't pay writers much and I am trying to change that. I'm paying the writers a decent amount if we can raise the funds. We want to make the lives of various writers better, and then continue to do so as the Mystic Punk genre gains a fan base. We want the next trend to be one of substance, so we're creating it from scratch.</p>
<p><strong>What is Mystic Punk, exactly?</strong></p>
<p>I tapped into some common themes that run through my favorite bands, movies, comics and television shows and came up with those criteria. This is what I'm looking for in literature and I think the rest of us are too:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Minorities!</strong> Why does ""Urban Fantasy"" have to be so white and hetero? It's so DULL. There is no URBAN environment in the world that is exclusively white and heterosexual. I simply don't get it!</li>
<li>
<strong>Mysticism!</strong> This is not a religious book. This is a book that explores the connection between YOU and YOUR SPIRIT, or the characters and their spirits. All religions seek to make a connection with the divine but I don't fit in with any mainstream religion. Neither do most people in our age group. The fastest growing religion, in the U. S., is non-religious. But that doesn't mean we aren't interested in the spiritual.</li>
<li>
<strong>Ambiguity!</strong> I'm tired of stories that exist with only one thing to talk about: which boy should she date, the hot one or the REALLY hot one? We seek to create stories that readers can share with their friends, have different understandings and communicate their understandings with each other. We want to make reading a communal activity the way other art is!</li>
<li>
<strong>A Punk Edge and Aesthetic!</strong> These stories look and feel like the counter culture it gets it's name from, like Cyber Punk. It is anti-authoritarian, individualistic, counter culture and even a bit confrontational. Plus, you know, weird hair, boys in make up, girls in fishnet stockings, ripped jeans, etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>Music!</strong> Music is one of the most precious mystical experiences we can have. Writers often use music to help them build the worlds in their head but we, the mystic punk anthology, seeks to put the music back out into the world through our stories.</li>
<li>
<strong>Hidden Faces!</strong> This is a unique visual cue; like goggles in Steam Punk. The faces can be hidden behind a mask, face paint or environmental elements such as smoke.</li>
</ul><p>That's it! That's all it takes! </p>
<p><strong>What We Need:</strong></p>
<p>We need $3000 to make this happen. Why do we need so much?</p>
<p>We're paying the authors between $100 and $300 dollars. There are currently 11 authors on board, but we are still accepting submissions. I capped the potential goal at $3000 so I could continue to attract writers and to hopefully get some who are more successful to add their names to the list.</p>
<p><br/>Because we plan to self publish the book through lulu and smashwords(for the ebook) we don't need to pay up front printing costs except for the perks that you'll receive.</p>
<p><br/>We'll also need to set up a website with information about the Mystic Punk anthology and advertising but this will only come out of what ever does not go to pay the contributing authors.</p>
<p><br/>I am not taking a payment for editing or writing the anthology though my partner James is taking $100 for his story and $100 for editing.</p>
<p><strong>Perks? What are these... Perks?</strong></p>
<p>I'm so glad you asked! The perks start small and get bigger and better as the donation size increases. You can read more about them on the side bar but here is a rough breakdown:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your name tweeted, tumbled, facebooked and more to all our fans. If you are a writer or are in a band, we'll promote your project instead of your name. If you have an indiegogo campaign, we'll plug that too!</li>
<li>A short story from the anthology, your pick! You can choose which story you'd like to read in various ebook formats!</li>
<li>A personalized thank you letter written on the back of a post card and mailed to you, signed by L. D. Robwell (myself). This will either be postcards from my box of Sandman post cards that I've never used or home made post cards in a collage style.</li>
<li>The full ebook!</li>
<li>A mystic punk soundtrack featuring songs by artists from a variety of genres that tap into some of the themes we're trying to write about. So far, Insane Poetry, Bad Mind and Divisible have all given me OKs to use their music. We're reaching out to several other artists though. It's been exciting!</li>
<li>An ebook with interviews with the writers! This is the ultimate in ""dvd"" extra's! This is a great way to learn more about the writers and their work.</li>
<li>A Mystic Punk art project in ebook format! Lots of art that taps into the mystic punk genre!</li>
<li>The full book in paper back!</li>
<li>An additional story by myself!</li>
<li>And the big one: a Hard Cover, limited edition version of the book with the extra story by myself included in the book, the books dedication to yourself or a loved one and a personalized thank you letter included in the introduction. This book will be a one of a kind collectors item!</li>
</ul><p>I have over estimated my goal so I can continue to look for new writers to add to the project. If we don't meet the $3k, we'll use what ever funds we have to pay off as many of the writers as we can so we can still move the book forward. <strong>If we don't raise enough to pay the writers</strong>, we'll issue refunds. </p>
<p><strong>The $40 perk comes with a paper back copy of the book, why is it so expensive?</strong></p>
<p>This is an unfortunate side effect of budgeting. I wanted to pay the contributors, with the price we've set we can meet our goals by selling about 100 copies, how ever, that will cost about $1000 dollars more. We're hoping that more people will preorder the ebook to help lower the actual prodcution costs. With e-books, the only cost is paying the writers for their work. With physical copies, we have to have them printed and then shipped, which costs a decent amount. </p>

</ul><p><strong>Why should you care about this new genre and my writing career?</strong></p>
<p>Even though I am a white, heterosexual male, I tend to write minorities of various stripes. The novel I am currently writing is about a teenage black lesbian who rejects society, including her family, because of sexist and homophobic attitudes. It is a YA novel set in the near future.</p>
<p>We need stories like this because it more accurately reflects the world we live in. Although women and gay characters are getting more attention there are other types of minorities, such as religious groups, the neurologically different, queer minorities who are not simply gay (such as asexuals, transgender men/women, bisexuals), mental and physically handicapped and more. Mystic Punk wants to put these kinds of people into the forefront of modern American fantasy literature.</p>
<p>The stories also ask important questions about reality and the human experience. These are not simple adventure stories, they are complex and emotional views into various truths that the authors have in their hearts.</p>
<p>I am a budding writer and when I was told that agents and publishers do not like to hear ""this is a new genre"" or ""this isn't like anything else that's out there"" they usually cringe. I don't blame them. But I was in a pinch because my writing did seem to be in a new genre. I could point to a few books that were close to the right genre but nothing matched perfectly. My coeditor, a good friend of mine named James O'Neil, and I talked the problem out. We came to the conclusion that releasing my own stories would not be enough to set a precedent. I could have done all that for free through smash words but we wanted something more, something bigger.</p>
<p>We decided on an anthology. The funds that we raise go to pay the contributing authors and to pay for the perks. That's it. The more we raise, the more stories we can have in our anthology and the stronger the book will be. That's why we need you.</p>
<p>If we can pull this off, we'll have set a precedent for the publishing industry that fights back against the bland, white, heterosexual and trope filled world of Urban Fantasy. I love Buffy the Vampire Slayer but it seems that the genre hasn't done much since then to warrant it's massive presence. Publishers are currently in a mode that they'll primarily only invest in things that have established markets. We're creating that market. We're helping science fiction and fantasy authors who are tired of being told that a book needs a vampire or romance love interest.</p>
<p>I've been unemployed for several years and have recently gone back to school. By helping me publish this anthology you are helping to open a world where the kinds of stories I like can be published without lengthy meetings about the severe lack of market for the strange kinds of stories I want to tell.</p>
<p>Many of the authors who are already on board are working tirelessly to expand their writing credentials so that they can turn their passion into what they do for a living. You're helping that come true, a few hundred bucks at a time.</p>
<p>I want this anthology to be like the Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All of the literary world. If we can pull this off, you'll be helping create an entire community of artists, not just one or two.</p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help that can help just as much as a donation!</strong></p>
<p>As I said before, I'm unemployed, which means that I often can't contribute to indiegogo campaigns even when I think they are amazing. If you love this concept but do not have the money, there are three simple ways you can help and one of them will help you earn some money!</p>
<p>You can also tell everybody you know about this project! Indiegogo even makes it easy for you to do this by providing share tools that will help you pass the link along through social media sites. Blogging about our new genre is a big help too.</p>
<p>Finally, and this one would be a huge help, if you send an email to writers you like who are not as famous as they should be, and tell them that they should get in on this, you would be helping us out a lot. Having an author with a decent sized name would help us out a lot.</p></div>","My name is L. D. Robwell and I'm creating a new genre.

<h3>Recent Radio Interview with me on Brooklyn College Radio</h3>
<p><a href=""http://sexandpolitics.podbean.com/2012/09/20/the-difference-between-sins-and-felonies-john-edwards-trial/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://sexandpolitics.podbean.com/2012/09/20/the-difference-between-sins-and-felonies-john-edwards-trial/</a></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p><strong><em>June 6th, 2011 I received a call from Iceberg News asking if I would cover the hearing of John Edwards, he has just been indicted by the Grand Jury. I was so excited when I got off the phone I turned to my wife and said, ""I just got a call from Everywhere, they want me to cover the John Edwards,"" I paused, ""Didn't he kill somebody or something like that?""</em></strong></p>
<p>This book from the point of view of a guy who wrote a few small time non fiction books, worked as a telephone psychic and who found himself in a media frenzy covering the historical trial of Senator John Edwards, once presidential candidate.</p>
<p>I was there, and this is my story.</p>
<p>The background is based upon a trial that took over a year to complete. I sat everyday at my chosen place on the bench, with pen in hand and a red notebook with the words inscribed over and over on the cover, ""All Work and No Play Makes Jack a Dull Boy.""</p>
<p><em>""<strong>So John,"" asked the girl from the Rox Affiliate,""What ""J"" school did you go to?""</strong></em></p>
<p><strong><em>""Oh no, I'm not Jewish, just a recovering Catholic,"" I chuckled.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>"" No, silly, I meant what Journalism school did you go to?"" she asked again.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>"" I never went to any journalism school, I went to an arts school and then got a degree in psychology.""</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>She looked incredulous. "" So how did you get this big assignment with Iceberg?""</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>""They found me on LinkedIn.""</em></strong></p>
<p>She shook her head in awe,"" Who ever finds a job on LinkedIn? I did it the hard way I guess.""</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My first concept of this book was going to be a straight recollection of what happened from a documentary point of view of what really happened at the John Edwards trial, but I even got bored writing it. I decided at 4:00 AM one morning that it would be far more interesting to write the story as a semi-fictional tale. I have numerous notebooks with notes of every court hearing that occured from the Grand Jury Indictment to the final moment when the jury read out the results of their deliberations.</p>
<p>I had some agents interested in the original version of the book, but they wanted cold boring facts about campaign finance, and PACS and SuperPacs, ect... This is really not me at all. I have written 12 non fiction books and numerous articles, not to mention my coverage with Bloomberg News, the NY TIMES and Reuters.</p>
<p>I also have experience with self publishing, as I am a freelance ghost writer, who has helped dozens of writers self publish their own masterpieces, so I know the industry quite well.</p>
<p>Many people in the United States, and around the world in fact, are looking at how elections are run and the integrity of our future world leaders. This was a landmark trial that explored both- money and sex. There have been a couple of other books written about John Edwards concerning his affair- one by his assistant and now the other by his mistress. Aren't we tired of the self serving crap? The ""Rimless Wheel Conspiracy,"" while funny also drives some hard truths home about how men in power behave, how people with money lose all reason. and what sleeping with a woman you just met in a bar can cost you. If we can't laugh about it, we will just get pissed off.</p>

<p>This book has been a labor of love and a <em>God dream</em> from the very start. What began with a simple blog, <a href=""http://lindasunporch.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://lindasunporch.blogspot.com/  </a>became a daily devotional written for my church. This devotional was co-written by me and my two pastors, Pastor Brian Law and Pastor Geoff Geyer. We wanted our church to have a special book to read together - Summer Reading 2013. We wrote a devotional book that focuses on what we call ""The Journey"" - 5 intentional habits that follow how Jesus lived His life on earth: prayer, study, worship, service and connection. Our book also encourages the reader to not just read about these habits, but challenges them to put them into action in their lives and to also journal about that action. We printed the book ourselves and handed it out to our congregation at the beginning of June. The response has been amazing and very positive. Many people sent notes, cards, messages and told me in person how much this book has meant to them. Several people suggested we should get the book published so more people could be touched by it as well.</p>
<p>I never planned to be a writer, but God had other plans for me! He has shown me that He can do amazing things THROUGH the people who trust Him enough to obey and follow his guidance. I believe God has moved me to write and has given me the talent and will to write and share God with others around the world.</p>
<p>Publishing is a difficult business to break into. I used to think that you wrote a book, sent it to several publishers and MAYBE one would like it enough to publish it and pay you for your work. Well, it isn't quite that simple now. In order to get established as a publishable writer, you have to publish. Unfortunately, publishing on your own costs money.  I have found a publisher who is interested in publishing this book at a cost of $4000. That seems like a fortune to me, and without help from my friends and supporters, it will continue to be just a dream.</p>
<p>I have signed a contract with 5 Fold Media, a Christian publisher out of Syracuse, New York. If I raise the funds to pay my portion of the co-publishing fees, they have committed to publishing my book and helping to promote it. The book will go through two editing sessions and I will be responsible for making changes they suggest. There is the possibility, I suppose that I will not complete the suggestions they make, but I feel that is a VERY slim possibility! Author training is also part of my 5 Fold Media contract, so they will help me succeed. I feel God leading me through every step of this project, giving me the courage, wisdom and guidance and support I need to move forward. ""With Christ, all things are possible!"" There is no guarantee that my book will become popular and sell as many copies as I would like to see so that the Living the Journey Day by Day  message touches as many hearts as it can. But, I am confident that I have done my part to obey God's call to me and where it goes from here is up to Him!</p>
<p>Please consider giving to the ""Living the Journey Day by Day"" project! You will be part of making this <em>God dream</em> come true!</p>
<p>THANK YOU!</p>

We printed the book ourselves and handed it out to our congregation at the beginning of June. The response has been amazing and very positive. Many people sent notes, cards, messages and told me in person how much this book has meant to them. Several people suggested we should get the book published so more people could be touched by it as well.
I never planned to be a writer, but God had other plans for me! He has shown me that He can do amazing things THROUGH the people who trust Him enough to obey and follow his guidance. I believe God has moved me to write and has given me the talent and will to write and share God with others around the world.
Publishing is a difficult business to break into. I used to think that you wrote a book, sent it to several publishers and MAYBE one would like it enough to publish it and pay you for your work. Well, it isn't quite that simple now. In order to get established as a publishable writer, you have to publish. Unfortunately, publishing on your own costs money.  I have found a publisher who is interested in publishing this book at a cost of $4000. That seems like a fortune to me, and without help from my friends and supporters, it will continue to be just a dream.
I have signed a contract with 5 Fold Media, a Christian publisher out of Syracuse, New York. If I raise the funds to pay my portion of the co-publishing fees, they have committed to publishing my book and helping to promote it. The book will go through two editing sessions and I will be responsible for making changes they suggest. There is the possibility, I suppose that I will not complete the suggestions they make, but I feel that is a VERY slim possibility! Author training is also part of my 5 Fold Media contract, so they will help me succeed. I feel God leading me through every step of this project, giving me the courage, wisdom and guidance and support I need to move forward. ""With Christ, all things are possible!"" There is no guarantee that my book will become popular and sell as many copies as I would like to see so that the Living the Journey Day by Day  message touches as many hearts as it can. But, I am confident that I have done my part to obey God's call to me and where it goes from here is up to Him!
Please consider giving to the ""Living the Journey Day by Day"" project! You will be part of making this God dream come true!

</h3><p>The Long Road Home<br/>One
woman's true story of reclaiming her life along the legendary Camino
de Santiago<br/><br/>When
Alesa sets off on a 500-mile pilgrimage across Spain known as the
Camino de Santiago, she can’t yet fully express why she would
undertake such a challenging trek. All she knows is she needs to get
far, far away from her pain and everything she knows … an
irretrievably broken marriage, a traumatic bout with cancer, a deep
river of depression leaving her little desire to even continue living
and isolating her further from her beloved teenage daughter.
Desperate to reconcile her past and find meaning again, she sells her
business and abandons her life for five weeks to walk the Camino with
just a backpack and a prayer. Little did she know that something had
to die on the journey in order for her to really live again. <br/></p><h3>Author's Bio:</h3><p></p><p><span>Alesa
 and her twin were born in a small town in the wilds of Wyoming where 
antelope outnumber people 1,000 to 1. Soon a brother came along whom
they could torment by dressing him up as a girl as often as possible. 
Despite their best efforts, he remains as manly as ever. When she wasn't
 torturing her brother, Alesa enjoyed writing every day, and in fact, 
she won a Young Author's Award in junior high.
Somewhere along the road to adulthood, she gave up her dreams of writing
 creatively to pursue the corporate dream. After stepping into the 
telecommunications world where she wrote technical publications, the 
dot-com bubble burst and she jumped into another
hot market: real estate. We all know what happened there! That is when 
she decided owning a coffee shop could be really awesome. And it was. 
For five years, she enjoyed being her own boss. Always
brave,
 she is now fearlessly authoring her first book, raising a teenage 
daughter, and hoping to inspire others to live their dreams unashamedly 
and unafraid.</span></p><br/><h3><br/></h3><h3><span>Notes from Alesa</span></h3><p>This book will be an inspiration to anyone who has ever felt less-than someone else, depressed, oppressed, ashamed, or any other equally debilitating feeling. After I walked the Camino, I realized I had gone there for many reasons. All of them having to do with an area of my life I needed to either see differently, forgive, or just plain let go of. Hanging on to some that old grief, though I didn't necessarily know I still carried it, wasn't helping me dig out of my deep-rooted depression. I hid it very well, though. Most of us do. <br/></p><p><span>This memoir is about my journey on the Camino de Santiago, during 
which, I 
processed the loss of my great love of 18 years while suffering a
 debilitating 
depression combined with a battle with cancer. Bruised and 
bewildered, I fought to maintain a facade of serenity while running my 
business and subjecting myself to the public eye. This caused moments of
 panic induced anxiety. I don't cry. I mean, never. The need to spontaneously
 emote in great quantities frightened the daylights out of me. The only option for me was to go away, go 
somewhere, anywhere where I could safely process my emotions away from 
anyone I felt would judge me. Yes, many walls were torn down along The Way.<br/></span></p><p><span>Prior to embarking on this great adventure, familial influences had begun to take root. Maybe I just needed to become happy! (oh, is that all?) So I 
could find the right 
Husband or the right career. Aha! The more I thought about my families attitudes and their ultimate affect on my well-being, the more I felt inadequate. Finally, bucking their ideas in my traditional, 
rebellious sort of attitude, I threw my hands up and abandoned everything. I sold my business, made arrangements for my daughter's care and took off for five weeks to walk 
500 miles across Spain by myself in an attempt to find answers. <br/><br/>I was unprepared for the healing that started in the most bizarre ways from my first night in Spain until the last. This memoir will 
inspire people as they follow me through some unexpected spiritual 
experiences and self-discoveries along the way. I hope to reach as many people who battle some of the demons I had. Will you help me?<br/></span></p><br/><br/><h3><b>What I Need &amp; What You Get</b></h3>Well, what's next? It's written and that is only the first step. Your support will help me bring this project to life. I focused on writing. My only goal was to finish the book. Now the manuscript is done but the costs are mounting to publish. I hope to raise $7,900 for this uplifting book. I plan to have it ready for publishing and marketing by mid-January! To make sure I stay on track with my self-imposed deadline, I am already scheduling reading events at local coffee shops and bookstores for late January!<br/><br/>This is where you come in. I need a few Angel sponsors who can help me create the cover, and get it ready for print and on-line publishing. Then, I'll need to publish, print, and market them. This requires converting the documents into other e-book formats for Amazon's Kindle, Barnes and Nobles' Nook, and the ibook, etc. If you are willing to sponsor this book, I will be forever grateful to you! Let's spread this story to anyone who has ever felt less-than adequate in any way! <br/><br/><br/><p></p><p></p><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3><p>If you want to help but can't make a monetary contribution, don't despair, there are other ways to help.

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>Imagine a media company which centered diverse and marginalized points of view, designed from the ground up to tell more stories in more compelling ways, using every platform at the Internet’s disposal. Imagine a place where people could have coffee with journalists, contribute easily to the news, and form a community of like-minded bridge builders both online and in real-time. Welcome to TribeHerald. A new family of media properties for people who want to “know more about more.”</p>
<p>TribeHerald Media, LLC was founded in 2020 by Yitz Jordan (Y-LOVE) and Rabbi Shais Rishon (MaNishtana), two African-American Jewish activists who have been executing programming in the Jewish community for over 15 years. Yitz is a hip-hop artist, the first hip-hop artist to come out as gay mid-career and the first to come out as a faith-based musician, and a web developer who brings over twenty years coding experience to his role. MaNishtana is a three-time published author and international speaker on topics of Jewish diversity and black Jewish experience, his latest release “Ariel Samson: Freelance Rabbi” was a top seller on Amazon upon its release.</p>
<p>We are creating the first news outlet to tell our readers what the world means to them, in their diverse communities, in their languages. Our hybrid subscription/advertising model, prevalent in digital publishing, promotes longevity, and our location promotes our positioning as the face of journalism “in the hood”.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We are looking to raise $75,000 for capital equipment purchases and furniture to get our space off the ground and to make the best environment we can for our reporters and our customers. And we want our contributors to be the first to benefit:</p>
<ul>
<li>For $100, receive our undying thanks, a one-year subscription to TribeHerald’s properties, and priority access to TribeHerald’s app when it’s released.</li>
<li>For $250, receive everything at the $100 level for two years, get access to all members-only content via all the sites and apps, as well as invitations to TribeHerald members-only events for the first two years. You’ll also get a cool TribeHerald tote bag.</li>
<li>For $1000 (limit 100), receive everything at the $250 level, plus a custom verse and video from Y-LOVE thanking you for your investment. You’ll receive a TribeHerald T-shirt (please specify size), as well as an invitation to a special Founders’ only event on launch day.</li>
<li>For $2500 (limit 40), receive everything at the $1000 level, plus a TribeHerald branded laptop or other electronic device. You'll also get a special shoutout on TribeHerald.com for one year following launch.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Media representation matters. It matters in Disney and it matters in movies. It matters in commercials and it matters in sitcoms. And, while much attention has been given to newsroom diversity, news too often consists of the same stories – told by different people. TribeHerald looks to center a different group of stories, stories that affect our communities, stories from our communities, stories told from a perspective of bridge building and diversity. Stories told from angles that no one else is asking about. And we think our stories are important enough to be told.</p>
<p>Y-LOVE has been a senior developer at Quartz for six years, and has been writing for 15 years on issues of diversity and struggles against racism and anti-Semitism. MaNishtana has been a writer and an editor for over a decade, and brings his unique perspective – of a life lived at the intersection of African-American culture and Orthodox Judaism – to all of his acclaimed content.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Since our main revenue streams will come from our utilization of the space for events, co-working and other bridge building and networking activities, any downturn in the neighborhood in which we are located could negatively affect our business. Also, a decline in subscriptions or sharp downturn in traffic could also negatively impact our bottom line.</p>

<h3>Why Hair &amp; Self Acceptance?</h3>
<p><strong>Self Acceptance is a habit.</strong> It can form at any age. It simply requires a healthy celebration of self.</p>
<p>We seek media that projects images of us back to ourselves. This is why representation matters. My Dear Queen is about more than representation. It provides a message of self love.</p>
<p>This year, I'm becoming a first-time father. This journey makes me realize the love and strength I want to pass to my unborn child. We haven't had the gender reveal yet, but if I have a daughter, I hope she foregoes the struggle with adoring her hair that her aunt and I have experienced. This hope led to me writing a poem that I realize needs to be a book for not just my daughter, but for every daughter.</p>
<p><strong>Every woman deserves to know her hair is her crown and she is a queen.</strong></p>

<h3>Why An Illustrated Book?</h3>
<p>These illustrations go beyond Colorism and Texturism to showcase beauty and hair in a completely different way. <strong>Yetunde Sapp</strong> combines warm colors and mixed media to present an almost <i>aura-effect</i> that isn't centered on skintone.

<h3><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h3>College Admissions of Guilt: How the Underserved Student Can Still Succeed in Higher Ed is a comprehensive college prep course in book form, offering guidance on all things collegiate (from choosing a school to navigating graduation). This book is more than self-help, as it is the personal story of a black transracial adoptee going through undergrad during the Trump Administration, and the mistakes made and lessons learned along the way. And don’t just take my word for it, as I’ve compiled the advice of EdTech CEOs, college presidents, award-winning professors, and Ivy League alumni on how to navigate academia as a lower-income, nonwhite, and/or first-generation college student.<br/><br/>My name is Noah Fenstermacher and I am the author of College Admissions of Guilt. I wrote this book because, as someone in all three of these subgroups, I am uniquely positioned to help navigate the higher education process. We often ‘don’t know what we don’t know' about higher education, and this book provides a guideline for some common questions asked and strategies for student success.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the power of telling your story on paper (resume) and in-person (interview). I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with self-help, escape from your comfort zone, and learn alongside first-gen success stories about the importance of finding your focus in life!<br/><br/>In this book, you'll encounter multifaceted dimensions of intentional intersectionality and the principles of fairness in a school setting through narratives like:<p>Race relations are not black and white...literally. As a transracial adoptee growing up in central Pennsylvania, I get that it’s complicated. To make my point, I went out to interview some talking heads with pointed white hoods. While I absolutely don’t advise doing it yourself, read on to discover the best advice concerning race relations on campus!</p>
<p>I’ve always heard, “Those who can’t do teach,” but have you heard of those that ""<strong><i>can </i></strong>do and teach?"" I interviewed a few colorful folks though educational technology company founder and CEO Samyr Quershi offers amazing insight for those with a passion for education and a pursuit of profit.</p>
<p>Did you know you can “haggle” your college tuition prices like a car dealership? Okay, it’s a little more complex than that, though what I learned from Harvard alum and current Ivy League recruiter, Gaelle, sheds light on college admissions scandals and what opportunities exist in scholarships and financial aid for students like me.</p> You will love this book if you are an underrepresented student, an educator working with underrepresented students, or have family and friends seeking knowledge.<br/><br/>College Admissions of Guilt speaks to current college students and college students-to-be who want to grapple with race relations on campus and equity in education in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that College Admissions of Guilt inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:<p>What can I do to elevate my chances of success as a college student?</p>
<p>How can a better understanding of self contribute to a better campus culture?</p>
<p>What questions do I have about college that I hoped are answered before I attend?</p> I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing educational equity will change us all for the better.<br/> <h3><strong>The Book - College Admissions of Guilt</strong></h3>
<p><br/>The book is written in 6 parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the author’s note + chapters 1-7. You will have a better understanding of the college admissions process, how to choose your school, and a vocabulary list of words to know before you go to higher ed. We’ll delve into my Pain Point Approach to pursuing passion and profit, specifically designed for underrepresented students to get the grade and the job.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains chapters 8-12. We’ll go over why it’s not about the brand name of the school, but the brand behind your name as a student. We'll further discuss how to navigate the two.<br/><br/>You’ll read about what it means to build your own personal brand, and how one student’s path from homelessness to head of the class at Penn can help you articulate your wants and goals both in the classroom and outside of it.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains chapters 13-17. We'll discuss how colleges collect social capital, how you can start stockpiling early, and what that means for your internship search during your second and third years at university. You’ll also read about my first school scandal story and the lessons learned that led to my student leadership on campus.<br/><br/>Part 4 contains chapters 18-22. We’ll explore financial and other forms of literacy you’ll need to not only survive, but thrive on campus. In fact, building off the Pain Point Approach, you’ll find out how to possibly make one thousand dollars every two weeks!<br/><br/>Part 5 contains chapters 23-26. Your mind is the muscle that matters most...well, the brain’s technically an organ, but you get the point! Mental health is important. Here, we will discuss tips gathered from counselors, as well as suggest collegiate resources available.<br/><br/>Part 6 contains chapters 27-30. We'll bring it all together here and talk about “cause marketing your character” to better sell the story of yourself. We'll attempt to solve that permission paradox: You want to get a job right out of college, but you need experience to do so, which requires your getting a job. Then, enjoy some parting words from college presidents and state senators on how best to navigate leaving academia for “the Real World”.</p>

Rencontre avec le peintre Alexandre Hollan le dimanche 24 mars à 16h : ""L'arbre est invisible""
 
Deux artistes en résidence en forêt de Fontainebleau
A travers le regard d'un poète et d'un peintre, la forêt de Fontainebleau révèle toute sa beauté et son mystère. La plume de Jean-Pierre Lemaire et le pinceau de Mathieu Wührmann renouvellent la vision d'un espace d'une singularité exceptionnelle. Une exposition et la publication d'un livre d'art sont au cœur de ce projet. C'est notre association ""l'Arbre en lumière"" qui en est à l'origine.

""L'Arbre en lumière"" est une association à but non lucratif qui a pour but de créer, promouvoir ou soutenir des événements culturels en lien avec la peinture et la poésie. Elle fait connaître et accompagne des artistes qui, par leurs œuvres ou leur origine, ont un lien avec Fontainebleau et sa région et dont les œuvres s'inspirent librement de la thématique de l'arbre.
Edition du livre Les Arbres et le ciel - Trees in the sky


Le livre sera intégralement bilingue. Sa réalisation est prise en charge par les éditions LIENART.
23x25 cm, 128 pages, 80 illustrations couleurs, couverture à rabats, broché, cahiers cousus collés.
Prix de vente public : 25 €
Un extrait de la maquette du livre:

JEAN-PIERRE LEMAIRE
Poète reconnu résidant près de Fontainebleau. Plusieurs de ses recueils ont paru chez Gallimard. Il a reçu en 1999 le Grand prix de poésie de l'Académie française pour l'ensemble de son œuvre. Son dernier recueil, Le Pays derrière les larmes, est une anthologie. (Poésie / Gallimard, 2016)
Un poème qui sera présent dans le livre :

Arbres
Les arbres restent toujours nos parents
et nous marchons à côté d'eux
dans l'ombre et la lumière
tandis qu'ils regardent un peu plus loin
vers l'avenir tout proche
murmurant sur le monde au-dessus de nos têtes
des paroles encore insaisissables
Les Marges du jour, La Dogana, Genève, 1981
Trees
Trees remain forever our parents
and we walk by their side
in the dappled light
while they look on ahead
towards the near future
whispering about the world above us
words we still fail to grasp
Poème traduit par Claire Gerolemous et Isabelle Lucas

<h3>Welcome to my Train of Thought!</h3>
<p><br/>Howdy! I'm humor writer and novelist <strong>Linda M. Au</strong>.  You probably haven't heard of me yet. <strong>Yet.</strong> If you <i>have</i> heard of me, then you're probably related to me or sat next to me in math class in the 1970s. But let's move right along... </p>
<p>A <strong>cross-country train trip </strong>has always been at the top of my bucket list. And, let's face it, I ain't gettin' any younger. So, what happens when a humor writer decides to finally live her dream? (Not the one where I marry Gene Wilder and we live on a cruise ship. THIS dream! The bucket list thing!)</p>
<p>Naturally, she gets on that train and brings along her laptop and writes about the experience. In glorious, humorous detail.</p>
<p>This is how the book <strong><i>Train of Thought: Travel Essays from a One-Track Mind  </i></strong>will be born.</p>
<p>And <strong>YOU</strong> can be part of it!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The trip itself will occur in  <strong>EARLY MAY 2017</strong>.</p>
<p><i>Here are all the gory details:</i></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Sitting</strong> on a train, <strong>sleeping</strong> in a tiny cubicle, <strong>staring</strong> out a window, and <b>eating </b>dining car food all cost money. I'm hoping to fund <strong>half </strong>the trip through this campaign. </li>
<li>The end result will be a <strong>book</strong>. A hilarious, marvelous, clever book.</li>
<li>A few months after the trip, contributors at various levels will receive <strong>copies of the completed book:</strong> the Kindle edition, the paperback edition, etc. Higher contributions will include <strong>copies of my <i>other</i> books </strong>as well (to be chosen by the contributor).</li>
<li>All contributors will also receive exclusive <strong>updates during the trip </strong>itself. I'll post interesting tidbits and snippets en route at Wi-Fi hotspots along the way.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All contributions </strong>will go toward the <strong>cost of the train ticket, </strong>which will be about twice what I hope to raise here. The rest of the costs of the trip will come from me. After all, I'm the one who gets to sleep in a tiny cubicle, to meet people I may not like, and to get stuck on a loud, moving vehicle for two weeks straight with fewer clothes and toiletries than I am comfortable with.</p>
<p><strong>ALSO: <i>ALL contributors</i></strong><i> </i>will be asked if they want to be included in the book's <strong>Acknowledgments!</strong><br/> </p>
</div><h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3><div>
<p>There is the risk that the trip will be a completely smooth, wonderful, beautiful experience and that absolutely nothing funny will happen for the entire two weeks.</p>
<p>But, c'mon. Anybody who knows me knows that that's <strong>not</strong> going to happen. The challenge is going to be quite the opposite ... shutting myself up once I start yammering on about all the outrageous, silly, crazy stuff I'll experience as I cross the country by myself, all alone for two solid weeks on a tra--- <strong><i>oh geez, what was I thinking??</i></strong></p>
<p>Oh, sorry. Did I just type that out loud? Carry on. Nothing to see here.</p>
<br/> </div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute right now, that's totally fine. I still need to get the word out about the trip, about the book, about <i>any</i> of my books. Use the Indiegogo share tools here to pass the word along to others who might be interested. You know:  other writers, fellow readers, train enthusiasts, people with a sense of humor, introverts ... and, of course, introverted train enthusiast writers with a sense of humor. Both of them.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Thanks!</h3>

<p>The Back Story</p>
<p>I have been working for many years with the “Activist” group of poets formerly led by maverick poet-teacher Lawrence Hart and now led by his son, poet John Hart.</p>
<p>Lawrence played a major part in the Twentieth Century history of San Francisco Bay Area poetry. In the 1930s, he made the ambitious claim that he could teach the new techniques unlocked by the Modernist poets to almost any willing student. He succeeded in producing a number of accomplished, award-winning poets who rose to prominence in the 1940s and 50s and continued to publish through the 1970s.</p>
<p>A different style, less wedded to technique and more focused on raw emotion and political rebellion, took center stage in the 1960s, while further generations of students continued to pass through Lawrence’s hands and his rigorous poetic training. One of these students, Lawrence’s son John, characterized this situation as a division between “raw” and “cooked” poetry, with the Activists being unapologetically “cooked.” And “Activist” doesn’t mean political (or non political) necessarily, but a focus on making each word poetically active, whatever the subject of the poem.   </p>
<p>What Does Spokes of Dream or Bird Do?</p>
<p>This book is part of a resurgence of publication by a new generation of Activist poets who believe that the territory Lawrence opened up is still vital and interesting. It employs a lot of metaphoric imagery, one of the techniques taught by the Harts.</p>
<p>Terry Ehret said of the book: “In Patricia Nelson’s poems, language is a vessel—sometimes a jeweled container to catch the ineffable, to harness or restrain its power like a djinni; sometimes a boat on the vast sea–surface, catching the winds of exhilarated flight or foundering in storms. This is the vessel with which the poet sets out, and we, her readers, are along for the journey. Through ancient Celtic forests, Dante’s landscape of the damned, and the garden of wordless, singing light from which our consciousness exiles us, Nelson’s poems offer a riddling map home—a way to reach one another, to counter the loneliness of our human being.”</p>

<p>Guatemala
receives very little attention in the international press. It has been nearly
20 years since the conclusion of the country’s bloody civil war, in which the
Guatemalan government was accused of committing genocide against the country’s
Mayan population. The country’s struggles with indigenous rights, women’s
equality, and the drug trade combine with limited telecommunications
infrastructure and a weak rural media sector to make Guatemala a prime location
for a GPI news desk.</p>
<p>Additionally,
according to the Global Media Monitoring Project, women are grossly
under-represented in the Guatemalan media. In 2010, there were just 37 female
reporters nationwide and women were the subjects of news coverage just 17% of
the time. The overall media landscape in Guatemala is limited, with only four
national TV channels – all of which have the same owner. Indigenous groups are
supposed to have the right to their own media, but licensing restrictions block
this promise from becoming reality.</p>

  Our Track Record of Success

GPI has news desks in 25 countries around the world. We have
found that our programs in these countries have social impact on multiple
levels, including:
·  Empowering women: our reporters are trained in a dignified
profession and are paid a living-wage for their work. They take greater control
of their finances, care for their families, and earn the respect of their
communities.
·  Improving journalism: by changing the storyteller, we produce
rich, ethical news stories on subjects and places ignored by traditional media.
We then syndicate our original news content to other media outlets, ensuring
that these stories go far and wide and increase global awareness about
developing media markets like Guatemala.
·  Igniting social change: our stories catalyze direct action, sparking social protest, provoking
international attention to issues first covered by GPI, and even changing laws
in two countries. For instance, last October the Rwandan parliament
passed a law criminalizing sex corruption in the workplace as a result of
reporter Ritha Bumwe's groundbreaking article about the growing trend of sex
corruption as a barrier to employment for women in Rwanda.   Other Ways You Can Help

<b>THANK YOU!</b></div>","An educative storybook app designed to introduce children to wonders of nature and plant life


Daisy and Roger are two kids like so many others: they enjoy playing with their cat Gregor, sometimes they quarrel among each other, and want to become, respectively, a ballet dancer and a jet pilot.

In addition they are passionate about nature thanks to their dad Sebastian, a world-renowned botanist and ecologist. 

Oh, I almost forgot... The year is 2080 and the two kids are traveling on a large interstellar spaceship to carry out a delicate mission: find planets suitable to preserve the terrestrial flora, threatened by pollution and by destruction of our ecosystem.



Spring Mission is an educative resource for kids (and their parents) to learn about plant life by means of amazing Sci-Fi adventures mixed with enjoyable educational components.

Each interactive storybook will be illustrated with charming artwork to spread a message everyone needs to remember: we have to protect our nature and bio-diversity!Our project is to develop a first Application for iOS and Android mixing:


an enjoyable story;


amazing illustrations;


funny animations;

puzzle games;

educational contents and tips on how to grow the plant in your own garden.


The storybook will contain 15 wonderful illustrated and animated pages, all with written and audio texts in English, French, Italian and Spanish.We’re ready to go. All we need is your support  in order to get this project off the ground.  Please, if you’re thinking of a kid who might love our space family, don’t wait: help us fill the reservoir of the spaceship, and be ready to follow Daisy & Co. in this adventure!


Be our bees, please

Help us in pollination! Please share the page with your friends and family and...

Why IndieGoGo

The hard part is already done - Angelo wrote the first story and Laura designed the main characters - but the journey is still long. 

Our spaceship is almost built, but we need your help for the fuel!

We did a detailed budget for all aspects of the remaining production, including the inevitable snags and sneaky costs in development, and we need founds basically to cover illustration and development, and even also:


Translations and editing in English, French, Italian and Spanish


Actors to speak the text in English, French, Italian and Spanish


Music and sound effects


Proof reading and final testing


Developing a supporting web site

Marketing activities

To these costs must then add Indiegogo's and transaction fees, taxes, and cost of the perks...

		
Yes! Perks!

All our supporters will freely download the storybook in both versions iOS and Android (if you don't have a tablet, we'll provide a PDF eBook version for you... and you can always download your app for free in the future). And for a contribution to the space gas we have designed some amazing perks:


an illustrated newsletter to be updated step by step on the development;


the Spring Mission's colouring book, a special printable PDF version of the storybook with all the illustrations in black and white;


the exclusive eBook ""Oreste's Space Kitchen"", with twelve illustrated vegetarian recipes from the Mediterranean tradition (all based on seasonal vegetables);


a digital version of the Spring Mission's Workbook, full of draft and information on writing, illustrating and developing a children storybook, plus additional artworks not included in the final version;


the limited edition Spring Mission hardcover book (in English, French or Italian) for the paper lovers;


a funny t-shirt (for men, women and kids);


a day tour with the authors visiting the ""Minerva’s Garden"", the oldest botanical garden in Europe, a delicious dinner, and an exclusive super limited edition (only 3 copies in the world!) printed book with an original illustrated story realized only for you.

Shipping costs for US, Canada and EU are already built into the rewards.
Story & Characters



Daisy and Roger cross the galaxy with their dad Sebastian to find new worlds adapt to grow terrestrial plants and flowers, and saving them from extinction. In each episode, this amazing family land on a new planet, meet bizarre aliens, and help them to solve their problems using terrestrial plants and flowers.

Daisy is a 10 years old girl and, despite her age, she is very smart and always finds solutions to problems... Solutions sometimes mad, often amazing, but always entertaining. Roger is her 12 years old brother and he is a real pest: great music fan and martial arts enthusiast, but he likes nothing better than get into trouble due to his stubbornness. 

Sebastian is a loving father and a brilliant scientist. ￼He is known as the greatest botanist in the world and for this reason he was entrusted to lead the Spring Mission. Hann is their mom: she remained on the Earth to follow her work as biologist and can communicate with them only via space-videoconference.

Gregor is a cat-mentor that can speak like a human using an electronic collar... But he is pedantic as only an old professor can be! In fact, in addition to assist Sebastian in his scientific researches, he is also the Daisy and Fabian's teacher. Oreste is the robot factotum that works as gardener and chef on the spaceship: hyperactive and pragmatic, often him and Gregor disagree about solutions and ideas, so the interaction between the ￼philosophical cat and the peppy robot is the driving force of many comical gags.

</li>My book on ABBA's recording history, ABBA: The Complete Recording Sessions, will be published in a completely revised, updated and expanded edition. Originally published in 1994, this new edition will feature more details on exactly how ABBA wrote and recorded their music, including classic hits such as ‘Waterloo’, ‘Mamma Mia’, ‘Dancing Queen’, ‘Knowing Me, Knowing You’ and ‘The Winner Takes It All’. <br/><p>I've been authorised by ABBA’s record company, Polar Music International/ Universal Music, and ABBA members <b>Björn Ulvaeus</b> and <b>Benny Andersson</b> to listen to unreleased mixes: plenty of alternate mixes of familiar songs and mixes of a handful of songs that were never released. The scope of the book has also been expanded to feature a lot more information about ABBA and their music: how it was packaged, received by the critics, and much more. <br/></p><p><b>Please note: The book will only be published if it is successfully funded through this Indiegogo campaign.<br/></b></p><div>

<h3>Project Background</h3>
<div>The first edition of ABBA: The Complete Recording Sessions was published in 1994, at a time when ABBA were still a long way from being the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame inductees they are today. The book, which detailed the background stories on how ABBA wrote and recorded their music, was based on interviews with all four ABBA members, their invaluable sound engineer <b>Michael B. Tretow</b>, as well as the most frequently employed session musicians who played on ABBA’s records. At the time, the book made quite a splash in the fan community—it was the first time anyone had published a serious book about the group’s music—and many have referred to it as their favourite ABBA book since then, which of course has been immensely gratifying for me.<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1268078/files/20150304094719-ks-crs-1994.jpg?1425491239"" src="""" style=""cursor: nw-resize;""/></p>
<blockquote>Original edition of ABBA: The Complete Recording Sessions.</blockquote>
<br/>This was my very first ABBA book, written at a time when I knew a lot less about the group than I know now. The publication of the book opened up an entirely new chapter of my life, and for the past 15 or so years it has been my profession to research and write books about ABBA, and to plan, conceive and contribute to official releases on CD and DVD, along with many other ABBA-related activities.<br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Why this new edition?</h3>
<div>
<p>I’ve long been itching to publish an updated edition of ABBA - The Complete Recording Sessions, and ABBA fans have let me know on a regular basis that this is something they would like to see as well. “But what could there possibly be to add?” I hear you ask. “Didn’t you cover everything in the first edition?” The answer to that is, quite simply: no!</p>
<p>Certainly, at the time I had access to all sorts of written documentation, tape boxes and such, from which I was able to piece together most of the hard facts of what was recorded and when and where. But—and this is crucial—I only had one single day of listening to tapes together with Björn, Benny and Michael B. Tretow in Michael’s studio. We spent six hours together listening to multitrack tapes, and what with putting those tapes on the machines, locating the songs I wanted to hear, playing them once or twice, then taking the tapes off again, general chit-chat, a lunch break etc., the total amount of music I got to hear—measured in minutes—was not that much. At the time nothing had really been transferred to a digital format, so the only way to listen to tapes, would be to hire a studio at my own personal expense. There was no way I could afford that at the time.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1268106/files/20150304095443-ks-crs-notes-1.png?1425491683"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<blockquote>Some of my notes from the tape-listening session with Björn, Benny and Michael Tretow in 1993.</blockquote>
Today the situation is quite different. Everything has been transferred to a digital format, which means that listening to tapes requires very little effort, and thanks to the encouragement and support of Polar Music International/Universal Music I will be able to listen to every alternate mix in the archives; however, the remaining multitrack tapes will probably be off-limits. Of course, ABBA’s <b>Björn Ulvaeus</b> and <b>Benny Andersson </b>have also approved my revisiting the mix tapes. So, now I will finally be able to hear what those alternate mixes are like. <br/><br/>

<h3>
<br/>Why are you self-publishing?</h3>
<div>
<p>There are several reasons for self-publishing. One is that I want to have full control over the book. What will the book look like? My decision. When is the deadline for submitting the manuscript? My decision. When will it be published? My decision. Quite simply, I want the book to be the best I could possibly make it — that would be my priority rather than having it out “in time for the Christmas market” or whatever other priorities a regular publisher would have. I want to make a book for readers who are really interested in learning the secrets behind ABBA's music and their history as a recording act.</p>
<p>Self-publishing will also enable me to make the book as nicely produced as I think it deserves to be. A regular publisher would inevitably regard ABBA: The Complete Recording Sessions as a special interest title, and that means cutting corners everywhere possible in terms of printing quality, paper quality and everything else connected to the book – including financial compensation to the author. I don’t blame them for that – they are running a business – but it would make it very difficult to make the book happen at all. Researching and writing a book like this is incredibly time-consuming, so while I don't expect to live in luxury while the book is being written, I will nevertheless need to eat and pay the rent.</p>
<p>A third reason is that self-publishing for certain kinds of titles is becoming more and more common in the book world. It’s the perfect solution for a title like this, which has a relatively small but highly motivated readership. In fact, I think there is a certain beauty in self-publishing: we’re all in this together, essentially, and with the aid of crowdfunding we can make it happen because we all want it to happen.</p>
<br/>
</div>
<h3>How <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">will the </span>new edition be different?</h3>
<div>
<p>The new edition of ABBA: The Complete Recording Sessions will be re-written from the ground up. It will offer a lot more than the original book:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>More </b>facts and stories about ABBA’s recorded work: released as well as unreleased songs and alternate mixes</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>More </b>observations and insights into the writing of the songs</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>More </b>insights from Björn and Benny</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>More </b>comments from other people who were involved in ABBA’s recordings</span><br/>
</li>
<li><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>More </b>reflections on the completed albums and singles</span></li>
</ul>
<div>This revised edition of the book will also have several new features, not included in the previous edition:<br/>
</div>
<div>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>New:</b> Vintage review quotes from the press, showing how ABBA’s albums and singles were received at the time of their original release</span>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><b>New:</b> Sidebars (separate articles) focusing on various aspects related to ABBA’s music; for instance: “Agnetha and Frida as vocalists”, “Björn the lyricist”, and so on</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1268144/files/20150304100311-ks-crs-spread-1.png?1425492191"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>This revised, updated and expanded version of ABBA: The Complete Recording Sessions will be completely redesigned and will be a lot thicker than the first edition. Whereas the original book encompassed 128 pages, I’m now looking at between 400 and 500 pages. </p>
<p>There will be plenty of illustrations in the book, in the shape of recording documents, single and album sleeves, vintage ads, newspaper and magazine clippings etc. Photographs will be kept to a minimum, so as not to affect the budget adversely, making the book too expensive for pledgers. However, in my budget I have set money aside for a fair number of photographs, with priority given to images that are relevant for the subject of the book: ABBA’s work in the studio. </p>
<p>In order to ensure this will be a quality product, the book will be printed at a highly reputable and experienced book printer in the UK. The first edition will be hardcover, 200 x 240mm, clothbound with dust jacket; both cover and insides will be printed in full colour, and the inside pages will be on high-quality matte paper stock. The book will be designed by a professional art director with over two decades of experience. All in all, I can promise you that this will be a very good-looking volume.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>Can I get a taste of what the updated version will be like?</h3>
<p>Yes! A couple of excerpts from the book are available as PDF files. The text and the layout are both subject to change as work on the book continues, but the excerpts will give you a flavour of the general direction we’re heading in. <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Download and read the excerpts here: </span></p>

</ul>
</div>
<h3>Why isn’t the ABBA logo on the proposed cover of the book?</h3>
<div>
<p>Only authorised books are allowed to feature the ABBA logo with backwards B, and despite Björn and Benny’s approval, the updated version of ABBA: The Complete Recording Sessions is not currently authorised.  But even if it were, it would still cost a lot of money to license the logo for use on the book, and I’d rather have funds go into the research and production of the book itself. </p>
<br/>
</div>
<h3>When will the book be published?</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>My goal is to have the book published within two years from the end of this crowdfunding campaign. If all goes to plan, the book will be published at the end of March 2017 [updated September 2016]. </p>
<p>That said, the publication may be postponed beyond either of those dates. But rest assured that it will only be postponed because I need more time to get the book absolutely right. I take my work very seriously and part of the reason why I want to publish the book myself is so as not to have to take a publisher’s demands and deadlines into account. Whatever happens regarding the publication date, everyone who pledges will be kept updated on how I’m doing with the project. My goal is to make you, the pledger, feel a part of the creation of this book.</p>
<p>In my life as an author, which spans more than two decades now, I have never accepted money for a project and then failed to complete it. In other words: you can trust me when I say that I always see my assignments through. In the case of the updated edition of ABBA: The Complete Recording Sessions, I can’t think of anything that I’d rather do in life than to research and write this book. It’s a dream come true to be able to go back to the book, correct the errors, add new information, improve on the prose and, generally, get it <b>right</b>. Nothing will stop me from achieving that goal.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Can you give me 3 reasons why I should pre-order the book and back this campaign?</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The Beatles have had a comprehensive Complete Recording Sessions book since 1988 – that’s 27 years at the time of writing. While the original edition of ABBA: The Complete Recording Sessions accomplished a lot, don't you think it’s time ABBA – a band whose popularity is just as great as The Beatles’ in many parts of the world – had a volume that is at least a little closer to the standards set by the Beatles book?<br/></span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Compared to their global popularity, ABBA have, generally speaking, not been served well in terms of quality literature. There are several reasons for that, but one is the paradox that while many people enjoy ABBA's music, only a comparatively small proportion of them are interested in reading a book about the group. As I see it, the only chance of having quality books published about them, focusing on a certain aspect – their music, their live concerts, whatever – is if dedicated ABBA fans join forces to make those quality books happen. So in the case of ABBA: The Complete Recording Sessions the crowdfunding campaign is essential – it’s now or never.<br/></span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">If you’ve read this far, I am going to assume that you have an above-average interest in ABBA. If so, I ask you, how many books and magazines have you bought over the past decade or so that tell you very little new about ABBA? Wouldn’t you rather invest your hard-earned cash in a nicely produced book that actually tells you something you didn't already know about the group? Because that is what the updated, revised and expanded edition of ABBA: The Complete Recording Sessions will accomplish.<br/></span><br/>
</li>
</ol>

My book on ABBA's recording history, ABBA: The Complete Recording Sessions, will be published in a completely revised, updated and expanded edition. Originally published in 1994, this new edition will feature more details on exactly how ABBA wrote and recorded their music, including classic hits such as ‘Waterloo’, ‘Mamma Mia’, ‘Dancing Queen’, ‘Knowing Me, Knowing You’ and ‘The Winner Takes It All’. I've been authorised by ABBA’s record company, Polar Music International/ Universal Music, and ABBA members Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson to listen to unreleased mixes: plenty of alternate mixes of familiar songs and mixes of a handful of songs that were never released. The scope of the book has also been expanded to feature a lot more information about ABBA and their music: how it was packaged, received by the critics, and much more. Please note: The book will only be published if it is successfully funded through this Indiegogo campaign.
You can pre-order the revised, updated and expanded edition of ABBA: The Complete Recording Sessions in two different formats:



Printed hardcover format shipped to your address anywhere in the world

Project Background
The first edition of ABBA: The Complete Recording Sessions was published in 1994, at a time when ABBA were still a long way from being the Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame inductees they are today. The book, which detailed the background stories on how ABBA wrote and recorded their music, was based on interviews with all four ABBA members, their invaluable sound engineer Michael B. Tretow, as well as the most frequently employed session musicians who played on ABBA’s records. At the time, the book made quite a splash in the fan community—it was the first time anyone had published a serious book about the group’s music—and many have referred to it as their favourite ABBA book since then, which of course has been immensely gratifying for me.



Original edition of ABBA: The Complete Recording Sessions.
This was my very first ABBA book, written at a time when I knew a lot less about the group than I know now. The publication of the book opened up an entirely new chapter of my life, and for the past 15 or so years it has been my profession to research and write books about ABBA, and to plan, conceive and contribute to official releases on CD and DVD, along with many other ABBA-related activities.


Why this new edition?

I’ve long been itching to publish an updated edition of ABBA - The Complete Recording Sessions, and ABBA fans have let me know on a regular basis that this is something they would like to see as well. “But what could there possibly be to add?” I hear you ask. “Didn’t you cover everything in the first edition?” The answer to that is, quite simply: no!
Certainly, at the time I had access to all sorts of written documentation, tape boxes and such, from which I was able to piece together most of the hard facts of what was recorded and when and where. But—and this is crucial—I only had one single day of listening to tapes together with Björn, Benny and Michael B. Tretow in Michael’s studio. We spent six hours together listening to multitrack tapes, and what with putting those tapes on the machines, locating the songs I wanted to hear, playing them once or twice, then taking the tapes off again, general chit-chat, a lunch break etc., the total amount of music I got to hear—measured in minutes—was not that much. At the time nothing had really been transferred to a digital format, so the only way to listen to tapes, would be to hire a studio at my own personal expense. There was no way I could afford that at the time.



Some of my notes from the tape-listening session with Björn, Benny and Michael Tretow in 1993.
Today the situation is quite different. Everything has been transferred to a digital format, which means that listening to tapes requires very little effort, and thanks to the encouragement and support of Polar Music International/Universal Music I will be able to listen to every alternate mix in the archives; however, the remaining multitrack tapes will probably be off-limits. Of course, ABBA’s Björn Ulvaeus and Benny Andersson have also approved my revisiting the mix tapes. So, now I will finally be able to hear what those alternate mixes are like.

Why are you self-publishing?

There are several reasons for self-publishing. One is that I want to have full control over the book. What will the book look like? My decision. When is the deadline for submitting the manuscript? My decision. When will it be published? My decision. Quite simply, I want the book to be the best I could possibly make it — that would be my priority rather than having it out “in time for the Christmas market” or whatever other priorities a regular publisher would have. I want to make a book for readers who are really interested in learning the secrets behind ABBA's music and their history as a recording act.
Self-publishing will also enable me to make the book as nicely produced as I think it deserves to be. A regular publisher would inevitably regard ABBA: The Complete Recording Sessions as a special interest title, and that means cutting corners everywhere possible in terms of printing quality, paper quality and everything else connected to the book – including financial compensation to the author. I don’t blame them for that – they are running a business – but it would make it very difficult to make the book happen at all. Researching and writing a book like this is incredibly time-consuming, so while I don't expect to live in luxury while the book is being written, I will nevertheless need to eat and pay the rent.
A third reason is that self-publishing for certain kinds of titles is becoming more and more common in the book world. It’s the perfect solution for a title like this, which has a relatively small but highly motivated readership. In fact, I think there is a certain beauty in self-publishing: we’re all in this together, essentially, and with the aid of crowdfunding we can make it happen because we all want it to happen.


How will the new edition be different?

The new edition of ABBA: The Complete Recording Sessions will be re-written from the ground up. It will offer a lot more than the original book:



More facts and stories about ABBA’s recorded work: released as well as unreleased songs and alternate mixes


More observations and insights into the writing of the songs


More insights from Björn and Benny


More comments from other people who were involved in ABBA’s recordings

More reflections on the completed albums and singles

This revised edition of the book will also have several new features, not included in the previous edition:





New: Vintage review quotes from the press, showing how ABBA’s albums and singles were received at the time of their original release


New: Sidebars (separate articles) focusing on various aspects related to ABBA’s music; for instance: “Agnetha and Frida as vocalists”, “Björn the lyricist”, and so on







This revised, updated and expanded version of ABBA: The Complete Recording Sessions will be completely redesigned and will be a lot thicker than the first edition. Whereas the original book encompassed 128 pages, I’m now looking at between 400 and 500 pages. 
There will be plenty of illustrations in the book, in the shape of recording documents, single and album sleeves, vintage ads, newspaper and magazine clippings etc. Photographs will be kept to a minimum, so as not to affect the budget adversely, making the book too expensive for pledgers. However, in my budget I have set money aside for a fair number of photographs, with priority given to images that are relevant for the subject of the book: ABBA’s work in the studio. 
In order to ensure this will be a quality product, the book will be printed at a highly reputable and experienced book printer in the UK. The first edition will be hardcover, 200 x 240mm, clothbound with dust jacket; both cover and insides will be printed in full colour, and the inside pages will be on high-quality matte paper stock. The book will be designed by a professional art director with over two decades of experience. All in all, I can promise you that this will be a very good-looking volume.
Can I get a taste of what the updated version will be like?
Yes! A couple of excerpts from the book are available as PDF files. The text and the layout are both subject to change as work on the book continues, but the excerpts will give you a flavour of the general direction we’re heading in. Download and read the excerpts here: 


ABBA CRS Excerpt 01 – 1973


ABBA CRS Excerpt 02 – 1974



Why isn’t the ABBA logo on the proposed cover of the book?

Only authorised books are allowed to feature the ABBA logo with backwards B, and despite Björn and Benny’s approval, the updated version of ABBA: The Complete Recording Sessions is not currently authorised.  But even if it were, it would still cost a lot of money to license the logo for use on the book, and I’d rather have funds go into the research and production of the book itself. 


When will the book be published?


My goal is to have the book published within two years from the end of this crowdfunding campaign. If all goes to plan, the book will be published at the end of March 2017 [updated September 2016]. 
That said, the publication may be postponed beyond either of those dates. But rest assured that it will only be postponed because I need more time to get the book absolutely right. I take my work very seriously and part of the reason why I want to publish the book myself is so as not to have to take a publisher’s demands and deadlines into account. Whatever happens regarding the publication date, everyone who pledges will be kept updated on how I’m doing with the project. My goal is to make you, the pledger, feel a part of the creation of this book.
In my life as an author, which spans more than two decades now, I have never accepted money for a project and then failed to complete it. In other words: you can trust me when I say that I always see my assignments through. In the case of the updated edition of ABBA: The Complete Recording Sessions, I can’t think of anything that I’d rather do in life than to research and write this book. It’s a dream come true to be able to go back to the book, correct the errors, add new information, improve on the prose and, generally, get it right. Nothing will stop me from achieving that goal.


Can you give me 3 reasons why I should pre-order the book and back this campaign?





The Beatles have had a comprehensive Complete Recording Sessions book since 1988 – that’s 27 years at the time of writing. While the original edition of ABBA: The Complete Recording Sessions accomplished a lot, don't you think it’s time ABBA – a band whose popularity is just as great as The Beatles’ in many parts of the world – had a volume that is at least a little closer to the standards set by the Beatles book?


Compared to their global popularity, ABBA have, generally speaking, not been served well in terms of quality literature. There are several reasons for that, but one is the paradox that while many people enjoy ABBA's music, only a comparatively small proportion of them are interested in reading a book about the group. As I see it, the only chance of having quality books published about them, focusing on a certain aspect – their music, their live concerts, whatever – is if dedicated ABBA fans join forces to make those quality books happen. So in the case of ABBA: The Complete Recording Sessions the crowdfunding campaign is essential – it’s now or never.


If you’ve read this far, I am going to assume that you have an above-average interest in ABBA. If so, I ask you, how many books and magazines have you bought over the past decade or so that tell you very little new about ABBA? Wouldn’t you rather invest your hard-earned cash in a nicely produced book that actually tells you something you didn't already know about the group? Because that is what the updated, revised and expanded edition of ABBA: The Complete Recording Sessions will accomplish.

<p><strong>Mon parcours avec Dieu, plus en détail... ""Je t'aime, un peu, beaucoup, à la folie, pas du tout... Passionnément !""</strong></p>
<p>J'ai grandi à Saint-Etienne dans une famille chrétienne protestante : enfant, j'aimais beaucoup aller à l'église et chanter lors de la louange, découvrir les histoires de l'Ancien Testament ou des Evangiles à l'école biblique... J'étais attachée à Dieu et je prenais les valeurs qu'on nous enseignait très au sérieux : Jésus était mon ami et je désirais Lui plaire.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>A l'âge de 13 ans, j'ai découvert la Communauté du Chemin Neuf, une communauté catholique à vocation oecuménique, lors de week-ends, soirées de louanges et camps d'été, avec des jeunes de mon âge. C'est là-bas que ma vie de foi a pris une nouvelle dimension et que j'ai appris à connaître personnellement Dieu, aux côtés d'autres adolescents avec qui partager ce que je vivais ! C'est en leur compagnie que j'ai vécu de très beaux moments, des temps forts riches en émotions, et c'est avec eux que j'ai décidé à 15 ans, un lundi de Pentecôte, de remettre tout ma vie au Seigneur. L'année suivante, je me faisais baptiser ! C'était une période merveilleuse.</p>
<p>En 2010, l'été de mes 16 ans, mon père et moi partînmes avec la Société Internationale Missionnaire pour une mission d'évangélisation de trois semaines au Bénin, en Afrique de l'Ouest. Il n'était pas prévu au départ que je sois de la partie, mais je crois que Dieu avait pour projet que je vive cette expérience et Il a vraiment ouvert les portes ! Ce fut un voyage merveilleux : un coup de foudre pour le continent africain et ses habitants, un temps de partage et d'enrichissement avec des chrétiens d'une culture différente, un temps d'enseignement et de louange également... Le retour en France fut difficile !</p>
<p>Mais dans le même temps, sans que je m'en rendre compte, je sombrais dans la maladie. Ce fut une longue période très dure qui commença. Coupée de ma famille, de mes amis, enfermée pendant des mois dans une chambre d'hôpital où tout était calculé, pensé, pesé, où la liberté, l'imprévu et la fantaisie n'avaient aucune place... C'est là que j'eus pour la toute première fois le sentiment d'avoir été abandonnée par Dieu. J'avais toujours pensé auparavant que dans une telle situation, ma foi serait mon roc, mon soutien, que rien ne saurait m'en déraciner et que je pourrai tout surmonter car Dieu serait avec moi !... Mais je n'avais jamais envisagé que je pourrais me sentir si seule, si délaissée. De roc, de soutien, il n'en fut rien. Je me sentais perdue, vulnérable, trahie ; je devins incapable de prier tant j'étais en colère contre Dieu. J'appelais à l'aide et Il ne répondait pas ! J'étais perdue et Il m'abandonnait ! Ainsi la Bible mentait-elle ? J'étais fragile, je souffrais et Il n'était pas là, alors que j'avais tant besoin de Lui... J'étais en plein combat, physique et psychologique bien sûr, mais aussi spirituel. Mes parents m'ont racontée à quel point j'étais agressive, au bord de la crise de nerfs dès qu'ils abordaient le sujet de la foi en ma présence. Avec le recul aujourd'hui pourtant, je vois combien je me trompais : et comment le Seigneur pourvoyait en toutes choses en ces instants, comment Il a pris soin de moi en plaçant les bonnes personnes sur ma route, et comment Il m'a protégée et défendue du danger que je représentais alors pour moi-même.</p>
<p>Quand je sortis de l'hospitalisation, j'eus mon bac de justesse en ayant suivit trois mois de cours de Terminale. J'enchaînais avec des études d'Arts Appliqués qui me passionnèrent ; je me donnais sans compter et en milieu d'année je fis une brutale rechute qui me reconduisit à l'hôpital. Désormais, ma rage contre Dieu s'était un peu apaisée... j'étais plus froide et indifférente en apparence, et pourtant je Lui en voulait beaucoup : j'étais mi-désabusée, mi-cynique. Je n'allais plus à l'église depuis longtemps : je ne m'y sentais plus à ma place, et entendre les chants de louange m'irritait profondément tant leurs paroles étaient en décalage avec ce que je vivais. Tout me paraissait extrêmement faux et hypocrite. Je ne me disais plus chrétienne sans pour autant me dire athée : j'étais dans un entre-deux inconfortable où je croyais qu'un Dieu puissant existait et qu'il pouvait agir dans la vie des autres, mais distant et absolument insensible envers moi. Il se penchait sur les vies des autres ? Tant mieux pour eux. Je ne remettais pas en cause leurs témoignages et ce qu'ils racontaient avoir vécu. Mais puisqu'Il m'avait rejetée sans raison apparente, alors tant pis, je me débrouillerai seule. Et si j'appréciais toujours beaucoup les gens de mon église, j'enviais leur confiance et leur optimisme illusoire qui leur laissaient croire que Dieu s'intéressait réellement à nos petites vies tout autant que je plaignais leur crédulité. Je ne supportais plus d'entendre parler d'un Dieu qui aimait chacun d'entre nous, tant c'était à des années-lumières de ma réalité. Quant à tout ce que j'avais pu vivre, plus jeune au Chemin Neuf, qu'est-ce qui me certifiait que tout ça avait été bien réel ? Est-ce que ce n'étaient pas plutôt des illusions que j'avais moi-même entretenues, dans mon désir de croire ? Ne m'étais-je pas auto-abusée, en définitive ?...</p>
<p>Je ne voulais plus douter, je voulais être fixée dans un sens ou dans l'autre. Chrétienne ou non, mais je voulais être convaincue au plus profond de moi-même : j'aspirais à la Vérité. La question de l'existence de Dieu, de son rôle dans nos vies, de sa nature et de la place que j'étais prête à Lui donner dans ma vie me paraissais bien trop importante pour une décision prise seule, à la légère. J'ai donc demandé, après trois années loin de l'Eglise, à suivre des temps d'accompagnement spirituel avec ma pasteure. Petit à petit, ma rancoeur a disparu et l'idée est lentement revenue que <em>peut-être </em>Dieu n'avait jamais lâché ma main et qu'Il était toujours là, trop respectueux pour me brusquer, mais qu'Il attendait simplement, avec amour et patience, que je sois prête à lui ouvrir mon coeur et j'ai à nouveau le désir de marcher avec Lui... Mais je restais prudente. Pas question de se faire avoir par de faux-espoirs ou des illusions venant de moi : cette fois, je comptais attendre d'être intimement persuadée avant de prendre une décision qui pourrait changer ma vie. J'analysais tout ce que je vivais avec la raison, et mon coeur était quelque part, bien barricadé tout au fond de moi, hors d'atteinte.</p>
<p>C'est donc dans cet état d'esprit que j'ai décidé de m'inscrire cet été, un peu au dernier moment, à un Festival International organisé par la Communauté du Chemin Neuf à l'abbaye de Hautecombe, car ils proposaient des ateliers de réflexions sur des thèmes d'actualités vis-à-vis de l'Evangile et autres sujets intéressants qui pouvaient m'aider à faire le point sur ma situation. Nous nous sommes ainsi retrouvés plus de 1200 jeunes gens de 18 à 30 ans, venant des quatre coins du monde (45 nationalités différentes, de l'Espagne à la Russie, en passant par la Lettonie, le Liban, l'Egypte...!), chrétiens de toutes confessions (une majorité de catholique du fait de la Communauté elle-même, mais aussi des Protestants de toutes églises, Orthodoxes Russes et Grecs, Anglicans...). L'idée de passer une semaine entourée de jeunes chrétiens convaincus et engagés dans la foi, la perspective de devoir assister aux temps de louange et de prière chaque jour, tout cela m'angoissait vraiment. Je craignais de me sentir complétement hors de propos et mal-à-l'aise toute la session... D'un autre coté, je voulais vraiment mettre ce temps au profit de ma réflexion en espérant que ça m'aiderait à me positionner définitivement sur la question de la foi.</p>
<p>Et ce fut été une semaine intense. Cela s'est fait tout en douceur, par des clins d'oeil de Dieu et des moments très forts où j'ai <em>su</em>, de manière inexplicable, intime et certaine, qu'Il était vraiment présent à cet instant à mes côtés et qu'Il m'aimait, qu'Il m'attendait. Alors j'ai décidé de Lui faire confiance, et je Lui ai tendu la main. Aujourd'hui je peux affirmer que j'ai vécu une vraie, une belle réconciliation avec le Seigneur : loué soit-Il pour sa patience et sa miséricorde infinie ! En prenant du temps pour prier avec des personnes engagées qui ont pu me conseiller et me soutenir, me transmettre des paroles ou des images qu'elles avaient reçues qui m'ont profondément touchée ; mais aussi par les temps de louange, de témoignages, de partage entre amis et d'enseignement... Dieu m'a fait comprendre qu'Il jamais cessé d'être là et d'attendre que je fasse à nouveau un pas vers Lui, et sitôt l'ai-je fait qu'Il a couru à ma rencontre !</p>
<p>Je sais désormais que même si le chemin est long à parcourir, c'est à Ses côtés que je veux le faire. Tout n'est pas résolu, mais je Lui remets ce que je suis, et je crois qu'Il sait et saura utiliser mes failles pour en faire quelque chose de bon, à Sa gloire.</p>
<p>A la fin de cette session, je me suis engagée comme Jeune du Chemin Neuf (JCN) : engagée à la prière quotidienne avec la Parole, engagée à me former et à témoigner autour de moi, engagée au partage dans la fraternité avec d'autres JCN, engagée à vivre la vie communautaire dans la mesure du possible, et engagée au service pour l'organisations d'événements tels que des sessions de week-ends pour les jeunes ou des festivals comme celui auquel j'ai pu participer cet été. La joie intense et la paix que j'ai ressenti à cet instant-là, en compagnie des autres nouvellement engagés, m'a confortée dans la certitude que ce que je vivais était bien réel, et que ce choix était le bon !</p>
<p>Concernant mes études pour cette année, j'étais très perplexe et indécise : plusieurs projets s'offraient à moi mais pour diverses raisons, aucun ne semblait me correspondre. L'idée de la Faculté de Théologie ne s'est pas imposée à moi, mais à mon père qui avait lui-même suivi les cours pendant une année, plus jeune. Ne me sentant pas particulièrement appelée à un ministère, j'ai tout d'abord été étonnée et plutôt dubitative... Puis c'est en y réfléchissant sérieusement que je m'y suis intéressée : les études proposées sont passionantes (à titre d'anecdote, à 13 ans, j'avais demandé à mon père de commencer à m'enseigner l'hébreu : cette langue me fascinait et me fascine d'ailleurs toujours !). D'autre part, la pensée de vraiment prendre du temps pour Dieu, pouvoir me consacrer à l'étude de Sa Parole afin de mieux Le connaitre m'attirait beaucoup. Cette première année, ainsi que les deux autres qui suivront afin d'obtenir ma Licence, me permettront enfin de fortifier et d'enraciner ma foi toute dans la Bible. Et je crois que là est ma place ! Je me suis inscrite à la Faculté à moins de deux semaines de la rentrée, et pourtant, Dieu a pourvu, Il m'a même trouvée une chambre à la Fac alors que tout était complet quand j'avais téléphoné la veille-même !...</p>
<p>J'ignore ce qu'il en sera de l'avenir, et sur quoi cela débouchera<strong> : </strong>à l'heure actuelle, mon unique certitude est que je mets ce temps à la disposition du Seigneur, et qu'Il sera libre de m'orienter là où sera ma voie, qu'il s'agisse d'un ministère ou non ! Car je crois qu'Il a des projets de bonheur pour moi et j'ai choisi de Lui faire confiance.<strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Merci à vous pour votre soutien, que ce soit dans le don ou le partage de ce projet autour de vous !<br/></strong></p>

En prenant du temps pour prier avec des personnes engagées qui ont pu me conseiller et me soutenir, me transmettre des paroles ou des images qu'elles avaient reçues qui m'ont profondément touchée ; mais aussi par les temps de louange, de témoignages, de partage entre amis et d'enseignement... Dieu m'a fait comprendre qu'Il jamais cessé d'être là et d'attendre que je fasse à nouveau un pas vers Lui, et sitôt l'ai-je fait qu'Il a couru à ma rencontre !
Je sais désormais que même si le chemin est long à parcourir, c'est à Ses côtés que je veux le faire. Tout n'est pas résolu, mais je Lui remets ce que je suis, et je crois qu'Il sait et saura utiliser mes failles pour en faire quelque chose de bon, à Sa gloire.
A la fin de cette session, je me suis engagée comme Jeune du Chemin Neuf (JCN) : engagée à la prière quotidienne avec la Parole, engagée à me former et à témoigner autour de moi, engagée au partage dans la fraternité avec d'autres JCN, engagée à vivre la vie communautaire dans la mesure du possible, et engagée au service pour l'organisations d'événements tels que des sessions de week-ends pour les jeunes ou des festivals comme celui auquel j'ai pu participer cet été. La joie intense et la paix que j'ai ressenti à cet instant-là, en compagnie des autres nouvellement engagés, m'a confortée dans la certitude que ce que je vivais était bien réel, et que ce choix était le bon !
Concernant mes études pour cette année, j'étais très perplexe et indécise : plusieurs projets s'offraient à moi mais pour diverses raisons, aucun ne semblait me correspondre. L'idée de la Faculté de Théologie ne s'est pas imposée à moi, mais à mon père qui avait lui-même suivi les cours pendant une année, plus jeune. Ne me sentant pas particulièrement appelée à un ministère, j'ai tout d'abord été étonnée et plutôt dubitative... Puis c'est en y réfléchissant sérieusement que je m'y suis intéressée : les études proposées sont passionantes (à titre d'anecdote, à 13 ans, j'avais demandé à mon père de commencer à m'enseigner l'hébreu : cette langue me fascinait et me fascine d'ailleurs toujours !). D'autre part, la pensée de vraiment prendre du temps pour Dieu, pouvoir me consacrer à l'étude de Sa Parole afin de mieux Le connaitre m'attirait beaucoup. Cette première année, ainsi que les deux autres qui suivront afin d'obtenir ma Licence, me permettront enfin de fortifier et d'enraciner ma foi toute dans la Bible. Et je crois que là est ma place ! Je me suis inscrite à la Faculté à moins de deux semaines de la rentrée, et pourtant, Dieu a pourvu, Il m'a même trouvée une chambre à la Fac alors que tout était complet quand j'avais téléphoné la veille-même !...
J'ignore ce qu'il en sera de l'avenir, et sur quoi cela débouchera : à l'heure actuelle, mon unique certitude est que je mets ce temps à la disposition du Seigneur, et qu'Il sera libre de m'orienter là où sera ma voie, qu'il s'agisse d'un ministère ou non ! Car je crois qu'Il a des projets de bonheur pour moi et j'ai choisi de Lui faire confiance.

</div></div>","WHY THIS BOOK?


It’s a stereotype because it’s true: men often have trouble talking about their failed marriages.
While they may be reluctant to openly share their pain, especially with other men, I think they’re more likely to pick up a book about it, where they’ll see their own struggles reflected and know they’re not alone.
When I was going through my divorce, I was desperate to find books that would offer advice and hope, affirm what I was going through, and let me know I’d survive it. 
I scoured the shelves, but almost all I found were titles like When He Leaves, Runaway Husbands, and A Woman’s Journey Through Divorce.
To be fair, I did find a handful of books written by men. Some were helpful, but few spoke to the emptiness and grief I was struggling with. Instead, the majority covered topics like how to secure the best attorney, keep your financial assets, gain custody of your children, and have great sex again.
Those are all helpful subjects. But Falling Forward is a different kind of book.
It explores the emotional landscape of a man’s divorce, from the marriage’s collapse to the author’s eventual healing. It’s a story about the questions all divorcees will recognize:
How do you start a whole new life from the ruins of all you’ve known for so long? How do you handle the shame of those who judge you for your marriage’s failure? Will you ever feel normal again?
What crutches work to pull you through the hard times and what don’t? Will you survive the bottomless grief of losing the most important relationship in your life? How do you handle dating again after years of marriage?
Falling Forward will be a collage of brief essays that recount a vivid journey of heartbreak, disillusionment, and ultimately hope.
But this book is not just for men. Pain is no respecter of gender. Fortunately, neither is healing. So just as men can benefit from divorce books written by and for women (like I did), I believe Falling Forward will also resonate with female readers, providing solace for their struggles as well as unique insight into what men experience.
It’s a labor of love, and I hope you can be part of the journey in bringing it to readers.
If you’d like to sample Falling Forward before you pledge, check out a short chapter here. 
Thank you so much!
Chris

<p><b>About me:</b></p>
<p>Hello!</p>
<p>My name is Alejandro, but all the
people call me “Ale”. I´m 38 years old and My love for trail running started
some years ago.</p>
<p>10 years ago they diagnosed me
psoriatic arthritis. This is a desease who causes pain and inflammation in the joints.
Slowly it started to hurt in to my feets, and after a time this was so strong
that I could hardly walk. There was a moment that I couldn´t go out of my bed
to go work. Like everything, I had good and bad days. Sport was allways in my
life and suddeny, every thing stops. I tried often to do differet things but it
was allways a big frustration.</p>
<p>That moment was a big change in
my life. I felt in front of 2 ways and I had to choose wich one I had to take:
Let the desease follow his path or fight each day like it is the last.</p>
<p>Probably you are thinking now why
trail running, because maybe it is not the best sport I can do with my
circumstances. A lot of people are asking me this and I have always the same
answer:</p>
<p>When I am in the mountains, go
out of the city and feel all the nature around me I forget everything, relax
and feel so good that it´s difficult to explain.</p>
<p><b>Running brings me to
life.</b></p>
<p>I know that it is a desease and
that I can´t go back in time, but it will not pick me off my love to sport.
When I am running, and I see my self doing it I begin to cry from happiness and
overcoming.</p>
<p>My next challenge is the CCC (101
Km), a modality  from the North Face
Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc (UTMB).</p>
<p><b>About the UTMB</b></p>
<p>The Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc is
a Ultrmarathon who takes place each year in The Alps. It is one of the most (if
not the most) prestigious trail race in Europe and a big challenge for every
runner.</p>
<p><b>We repeat!!</b></p>
<p>We are very lucky and have been
selected for a second time to do this race. The first time I enjoy it a lot and
cross the finish line was a very big satisfaction.</p>
<p><b>The challenge</b></p>
<p>We want that it is very special
this time, not only because we want to beat our personal record, but because we
would be very happy to tell every one in first person that you can fight for
your dreams and maybe this way helps someone who are in a not so good moment or
has any problem to find a little bit of light.</p>
<p>I will fight in the CCC!!!!  <b>No
limits!!!!</b></p>
<p><b>Contributors:</b></p>
<p>In this way I met the team <b>Undondin Visual Studio</b> who helped me to
start with the project “Los Kilómetros de Ale” (“The kilometers from Ale”) and
to promoting it to get where it is now.</p>
<p>They made also the video and the
design of the T-Shirts.</p>
<p>I thank also Raquel Marcos Geijo
for her help with the video and Hector Muñoz for “training” us for the
crowdfunding, we will follow your tips, thank you!!!</p>
<p><b>Where are the funds
go??</b></p>
<p>A race like this has allways a
lot of expenses (accommodation, flights…) that at this moment I can´t cope. </p>
<p>That is why I ask for your collaboration.</p>
<p>The funds are destinated to pay
the travel and accommodation at the Alps so that I can do the race. And also
to  pay the production and delivery of
the rewards.</p>
<p><b>How you can
collaborate??</b></p>
<p>It is very easy: choose the
reward that you like at most and the website will explain you how to go on.</p>
<p>All kind of help is welcome, so
if you want and like the Project you can help sharing it in Facebook, Twitter
or telling it to people you think they are interested, what you want!!!</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your
collaboration!!!! And remember:</p>
<p><b>NO LIMITS!!!!!</b></p>

About me:
Hello!
My name is Alejandro, but all the
people call me “Ale”. I´m 38 years old and My love for trail running started
some years ago.
10 years ago they diagnosed me
psoriatic arthritis. This is a desease who causes pain and inflammation in the joints.
Slowly it started to hurt in to my feets, and after a time this was so strong
that I could hardly walk. There was a moment that I couldn´t go out of my bed
to go work. Like everything, I had good and bad days. Sport was allways in my
life and suddeny, every thing stops. I tried often to do differet things but it
was allways a big frustration.
That moment was a big change in
my life. I felt in front of 2 ways and I had to choose wich one I had to take:
Let the desease follow his path or fight each day like it is the last.
Probably you are thinking now why
trail running, because maybe it is not the best sport I can do with my
circumstances. A lot of people are asking me this and I have always the same
answer:
When I am in the mountains, go
out of the city and feel all the nature around me I forget everything, relax
and feel so good that it´s difficult to explain.
Running brings me to
life.
I know that it is a desease and
that I can´t go back in time, but it will not pick me off my love to sport.
When I am running, and I see my self doing it I begin to cry from happiness and
overcoming.
My next challenge is the CCC (101
Km), a modality  from the North Face
Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc (UTMB).
About the UTMB
The Ultra Trail du Mont Blanc is
a Ultrmarathon who takes place each year in The Alps. It is one of the most (if
not the most) prestigious trail race in Europe and a big challenge for every
runner.
We repeat!!
We are very lucky and have been
selected for a second time to do this race. The first time I enjoy it a lot and
cross the finish line was a very big satisfaction.
The challenge
We want that it is very special
this time, not only because we want to beat our personal record, but because we
would be very happy to tell every one in first person that you can fight for
your dreams and maybe this way helps someone who are in a not so good moment or
has any problem to find a little bit of light.
I will fight in the CCC!!!!  No
limits!!!!
Contributors:
In this way I met the team Undondin Visual Studio who helped me to
start with the project “Los Kilómetros de Ale” (“The kilometers from Ale”) and
to promoting it to get where it is now.
They made also the video and the
design of the T-Shirts.
I thank also Raquel Marcos Geijo
for her help with the video and Hector Muñoz for “training” us for the
crowdfunding, we will follow your tips, thank you!!!
Where are the funds
go??
A race like this has allways a
lot of expenses (accommodation, flights…) that at this moment I can´t cope. 
That is why I ask for your collaboration.
The funds are destinated to pay
the travel and accommodation at the Alps so that I can do the race. And also
to  pay the production and delivery of
the rewards.
How you can
collaborate??
It is very easy: choose the
reward that you like at most and the website will explain you how to go on.
All kind of help is welcome, so
if you want and like the Project you can help sharing it in Facebook, Twitter
or telling it to people you think they are interested, what you want!!!
Thank you very much for your
collaboration!!!! And remember:

<p>Because I struggled with self-limiting belief as a child, and have seen the negative impact it brought me, this inspired me to write  ""Good Morning, Mirror.""

<p>As dangerous as one child believing the negative things he or she hears from others, it is more dangerous when a child believes his or her own negative self-talk.

TiddlyWiki is an open source system for creating and sharing unique, portable, ""personal wiki"" web documents. It offers a rich variety of data handling and browser-based display features with a highly customizable interface.
Although this flexibility provides great power to create a wide range of purpose-built ""web applications"", there is also a lot to learn in order to take full advantage of TiddlyWiki's powerful features.
In order to address this, I propose to write a book, ""Inside TiddlyWiki"", that will offer instruction and guidance -- including examples, tutorials, and real-world case studies -- to illustrate the concepts, methods, and best practices for using TiddlyWiki to build effective solutions for common, every day, real-world applications.
Who Am I?
Beginning in the early days of TiddlyWiki (April 2005), I have worked closely with its creator, Jeremy Ruston, to develop and improve TiddlyWiki's core functions. For the past few years I have been the lead developer and maintainer of the TiddlyWiki Classic codebase.
I am also the creator of www.TiddlyTools.com (""Small Tools for Big Ideas!""), a very popular collection of over 400 original plugins, scripts, themes, etc. that I have written and freely shared with the TiddlyWiki community to provide a rich variety of new features and enhancements they can add to their TiddlyWiki documents.
For the past 10 years, I have been a key contributor and administrator of the online TiddlyWiki GoogleGroups discussion forums, providing ongoing assistance to the worldwide TiddlyWiki community, and have written more than 4000 detailed responses to individual questionsposted online.
Professionally, I am an independent software design consultant, living in Silicon Valley, where I apply over 30 years of experience in the software industry to provide analysis and design services to software development companies, with emphasis on information architecture and interaction/visual design standards to improve ease-of-use for new and existing software and online web products.
The Writing Process
""Inside TiddlyWiki"" will be written as a series of separate guidebooks, each containing a set of in-depth, stand-alone articles targeting a particular audience and presenting specific TiddlyWiki concepts.
In keeping with the community-driven nature of TiddlyWiki, all contributors to this project will be invited to participate in the review of draft content and revisions which I will periodically post on an InsideTiddlyWiki GoogleGroup discussion forum.
The book will initially be published online as a TiddlyWiki-based website. The content may later be adapted to eBook and/or PDF formats and will also available through print-on-demand services to produce a traditional hard copy bound book (a first edition autographed printed copy will be offered as a perk for high-level contributors).
Initial Funding Goal
Good writing takes time, and focus.  As a rough estimate, each $2500 in funding supports approximately one month of uninterrupted work on writing book content.
The initial project funding goal is intended to enable me to work full-time for at least several months writing articles for the first volume of Inside TiddlyWiki -- an introductory ""User's Guide"" --  to help people get started with TiddlyWiki installation, basic usage, and simple content creation.

TiddlyWiki Concepts: MicroContent and Tiddlers
How to Setup TiddlyWiki
Basic Usage: Editing, Viewing, Navigation
Creating Content: Text, Links, and Images
Keeping your TiddlyWiki up-to-date



Of course, this is only a rough outline: the final outline of topics will be determined after being posted for discussion and review online.
Extended Funding Goals
Once the initial project goal is reached and the ""Inside TiddlyWiki User's Guide"" is completed, I will continue to write additional guidebooks in the ""Inside TiddlyWiki"" series as long as sufficient funding remains.
Each of these guidebooks will likely take several months to draft, revise and publish. Extended funding will allow me to continue to devote myself to writing full time, without being diverted by work on other client projects.
Here are a few ideas for these additional volumes:



An Author's Guide, illustrating advanced techniques for content creation and customization of the TiddlyWiki interface, including use of tiddler fields, transclusion, embedding, widgets, filters, macros, styles and themes.

If you contribute $250 USD, you will be listed as a ""Patron of Inside TiddlyWiki"", as well as receiving a credit for two hours of private consulting for one of your own TiddlyWiki documents.
For a generous contribution of $500 USD, you will be listed as a ""Partner of Inside TiddlyWiki"" and receive an exclusive autographed first edition printed copy of the ""Inside TiddlyWiki User's Guide"", as well as credit for four hours of private consulting for one of your own TiddlyWiki documents.
Of course, larger contributions are always welcome, and I invite contributors of over $500 USD to suggest any additional perk(s) that they feel would be uniquely suited to their particular needs.

The idea for this e-book sprung from my monthly column
WWTBD? What Would the Boss Do? in the monthly screenwriting e-zine A-List
Screenwritingâ€™s Craft & Career.  These dozen or so essays take an entertaining but
serious look at the masterful storytelling craft in the songs of Bruce
Springsteen.


 
Consider the final verse of
â€œCautious Manâ€:

 
Billy felt a coldness rise
up inside him that he couldn't name

Just as the words tattooed
'cross his knuckles (fear
& love) he
knew would always remain

At their bedside he brushed
the hair from his wife's face as the moon shone on her skin so white

Filling their room with the
beauty of God's fallen light

 

Wow, talk about love and
truth. This three-minute story brings as powerful and clear-cut a dilemma
to Billy as does Casablanca to Rick.  This was like a rewriting of
every Bruce song up to Tunnel
of Love.  Billy went for a ride out on the highway but it didnâ€™t bring
him any relief: â€œhe didnâ€™t find nothing but road.â€  Emotion and theme
merge as the songâ€™s ultimate revelation hits us that the faith and courage to
coexist with doubt, fear and imperfection is what love is.  Just like Casablancaâ€™s â€œAs Time Goes Byâ€, it
reminds us that itâ€™s a fight for love and glory.

 

In this song, I could discuss
dilemma or how theme is created in the climax and aftermath. Topics I have
or will explore in the e-Book include breaking clichÃ©s, bridge, subplots,
surprise, repetition, ellipsis, exploitation of concept, contrast, nature of
love stories and several others.

 
I have about 8,000 words and plan to triple the content, add some pictures, an introduction, and maybe some other fun stuff.  Writers will appreciate the
craft discussion. But the casual tone allows plain olâ€™ â€œBruce Fansâ€ to enjoy
insight into their favorite songs.  


 
I am a filmmaker and
writer who also helps writers
with their stories.  When I am not writing or making movies, I share my insight with others in workshops and articles.  In a monthly screenwriting newsletter, I showed how Bruce Springsteen's song The Line contains everything screenwriters need to know about their scripts.

 
â€œSearching for one Clear
Moment of Love and Truthâ€ is a line from Bruceâ€™s song â€œReal Worldâ€ and it sums
up our journey in life and in storytelling.   Sometimes stories can
bring it to us more succinctly than life.  And, ironically, storytelling
has brought it to me in real life. 

I met my
wife because of our shared love of for Bruce Springsteenâ€™s music.  However, this project is not about what storytelling has brought to me. 
Itâ€™s not a memoir.  But itâ€™s not a straightforward instructional book,
either.  Itâ€™s about Bruceâ€™s stories and his deftness at telling them. It
is a reminder of the enormous impact stories can have on us.  Itâ€™s a
â€œthank youâ€ to Bruce Springsteen but most of allâ€¦

This is my
love letter to storytelling.





The Impact

These essays were first targeted toward
screenwriters and storytellers but I want to reach out to the songwriting
community too.  I will dig a bit deeper
into song structure and the narrative patterns of blues, rock and other
forms that influenced Bruce.  There are
some musical techniques like the call-and-return which are unique to singing
but elements like the bridge functions like a subplot which clarifies theme and
creates a contrast that sets up the climax. 
Songwriters will gain insight into the surprising ways storytelling  principles inform even (apparently)

conversational and for every ounce of principle I discuss, there is an equal
amount of passion, so the rank-and-file Bruceophiles will dig the book,
enjoying insight into why their favorite songs are so meaningful and
moving.

The project will cover dozens of songs ranging from Springsteen's first album Greetings from Asbury Park and his newest album Wrecking Ball.  Sure, you will get Thunder Road, Born in the USA and Darkness on the Edge of Town but there will also be some lesser known songs as Highway 9, Kingdom of Days and New Timer. 

One of my favorite essays is about Redheaded Woman. It's apt title is ""Coming up with Going Down!""

</div></div>","My name is El Earl.
Since I was five years of age I have not spoken to anyone but my family. I have
an illness that is called ""Selective mutism."" It is an anxiety disorder,
which makes me scared to talk to people. A lot of the symptoms are much like
autism, yet selective mutism and autism are not related. 

I
have trusted very few people and opened up to them. I have been working on a
novel about my life and my condition. It is a story about how I got bullied my
whole life and I dealt with it, but most of all it is a story about how even
though I have this condition I have done so much in life, I have worked, I have
attended university, I have held art exhibitions... This story is for all the
teenagers, adults, and people out there who suffer everyday because they are
different, or because they are bullied for some reason or another. I am hoping
my novel will help people, for every person who reads it and for every person
who feels better or stronger for it and who can relate to me and what I have
gone through, I am happy that I am doing something for people.
I want to self publish this novel, and
then I want to make copes and sell some of course, but also donate some to
schools to have in their libraries. I think this will be a good read for school
students, but also it is not limited just for a young audience. I think a lot
of people will love my novel and find it honest, sad, quirky and most of all
inspiring. 
If I do not reach my entire goal it is okay, there are cheaper
self publishing options and I will just do them.
I hope after someone reads my novel
they will notice a lonely person in school, or work or wherever and make an
effort with that person. If that happens then I know my novel is a success. 
Why is my novel so important to me? an English
teacher at school plus two university teachers said to me ""El one day I am
going to walk into Borders and buy your book"" It is sad that Borders does
not exist anymore but I am hoping that what they said comes true true, and one
day they will be sitting on their couch on a cold Sunday night reading my
words. 
I have a few publishers in mind and
sussing out the best one. No publishers have read my book yet but one publisher
that isn't very expensive has read a chapter and would love to help me make it
a success. 
Other Ways You Can Help
Please tell people about this, about my book. I think my story
may even help people in the medical field understand my problem a little bit
better. I was a very lonely teenager, I had no friends so started to write this
book is what saved me. I had something to look forward to. Years later I went
over it and finished it, and I feel it is the best thing I have written in my
life.
 
Here is a little bit of my novel :) 
 
Like Robert Frost said in his poem ‘The Road
Less Traveled’ From the two roads ahead, you can only choose one, and you can’t
turn back and take the other, because along the way there are going to be other
roads to choose from. I must have somewhere taken the wrong road.
I
stopped talking…
I
got selective mutism.
           
Selective mutism is a childhood anxiety
disorder. It’s
much more then just shyness. The child is not refusing to speak because that’s what they want, they just can’t. The child continues to speak at home
but stops speaking in school, and at other social events. They don’t have autism, or a communication
disorder.
 
CHAPTER ONE
 
Mid
1997
 Age: 16
 
You’re somewhere in between, a pale
stair,
An ocean way too deep, skies up where
they belong,
Cold sensation on the neck, hard ruffle
in the grass,
Running faster through thousands of
tree’s, as if there’s no way out.
A maze of insecurities, keep going the
wrong way,
Bumping into dead ends, if turning back
which way to go?
A hint of a wind, now it’s gone.
 
Henna painted arms, leaking from the
rain,
Like smudged mascara, dripping within
tears,
Like a waterfall, throwing a person into
the ocean,
Nothing.
 
 
           
It
is my first period of the day; science class. The science room door is green
with a little glass window on the top of it and has the word ‘science’ written
on it. Every time I approached this room I just want to run away, as fast as I
can in the opposite direction. I imagine the school hallway going all dark, and
have a chill down my spine as if some one in a mask and black coat is chasing
me with a knife. I want to scream.
I
walk into class.
            “Seated please,” Mrs.
Brindchick yells in her accent, I can never figure out what accent she has. I
find myself grinding the little bit of fingernails I have left (yes I am a
biter) on the edge of my desk. Mrs. Brindchick doesn’t try to understand me like my other
teachers, she always finds ways to humiliate me in class, and then fail me on
the pure fact;
“I
vill not pass a girl who refuses to speaka to me,”
The
funny thing is she gets away with it.
            “You” she pointes at
me directly.  I have been in class less then
ten minutes and already she has decided it is time to have fun, purely on my
misfortune.
             I
zone back into reality and stop thinking about what she would look like in hell
with the devils and fire and…
            “You!”
She
never says my name; it is as if my name is as bad as saying fuck in a class
full of sixteen year olds.
            I nod blankly.
            “Vhy don’t you start telling ze class vat last
nights homevork readings vere about?”
            I pick up my pen and paper and
am about to write, but before my pen can even touch the piece of paper she
interrupts me.
            “Verbally.”
            I sink into my seat.
            “How about you Leslie?” she
asks another student.
That
student does reply verbally.
            When I think class can’t get any worse I am in for a surprise.
We are paired up to do an experiment with a partner. I have to do mine with
Mony. She is tall with dark brown hair and thinks she is beautiful, personally
because of her personality she reminds me of a dropped meat pie. Okay that’s a bit mean a dropped meat pie that’s been put back together, there you go.
            “You know just coz we are doing this
together, it don’t
mean we’re gonna be friends or anything,” she says
lighting the Bunsen burner,     
            I nod.
            “Like you know if I was gonna buy a
parrot, like I’d
buy the parrot that spoke you know? If that makes much sense? Not the parrot
that was dumb.”
The
word ‘dumb’ rings
in my ears like a siren.  I look over at her smiling
face; it is as if she thinks it is okay the way she is talking to me. I don’t know who I fell sorry for more her or
myself; me for having to put up with her or her for having such a sour
personality. Maybe she’s
just dumb? Yes let’s
leave it at that she’s
just dumb.
Sure
I’m different but I know that when people put other peoples down it means that
they see in those other people things they have in themselves. By putting these
people down it means that they fell better about their own lives.
            Everybody in the world has
differences however they’re
hidden. Some people may have a toe missing, or something tiny like that, that
people don’t
notice. However with mine everyday it gets in the way. People don’t want to get
to know me, boss’s
don’t want to hire me, people in shops think I’m rude when I don’t reply to
their “Hello how are you?’” verbally
or say “Thanks” after
receiving my change.
            That afternoon I sit in my
bedroom leaning against my desk; I am staring at a paperback novel I have to
read for English class, it’s so boring. My hair swings over my face as if it is
a curtain, and my face is the window that it is protecting from the world. A
world, which I am afraid of, why? I don’t
know. I don’t
speak, I barely eat in public, and people scare the hell out of me. There were
things that happened to me when I was a child; however I have somehow erased
them from my memory, they are too painful to face. I may seem different to you
because I don’t
speak, but don’t be
fooled by that I am just an ordinary girl.

</div> <div> <h3>Sneak Peak-- Excerpt From Chapter 1</h3> <p></p>
</div><i>Walks home were more like scheming races to safety from Dudley, and the mornings were nothing short of humdrum, predictable scenes. It wasn’t until an early August morning in 1951 that everything I knew so well would shift. After strolling pass the same building and passing the same cars and people for months, I never expected anything too exciting. Yet, this particular morning, something with destiny intensions was set to intervene.  Right on schedule, coming down the road the delivery truck was headed to where I was headed, transporting drinks to Kress. It was always the same delivery guy. I prepped for my usual neighborly wave and hello. But this time, he slowed down and leaned out the window.  “Meet me at the next corner,” he said quickly.  There was no time to respond and really no decision to make. You see, I had to turn that corner in order to get to work. He knew that. I didn’t know much about the guy except that he knew some of the girls I worked with and had asked them about me. Oh, and that he was strikingly handsome. The kind of handsome that couldn’t go unmentioned when he walked into a room. He was Italian – dark complexion, dark brown eyes, and a head full of black curly hair.  “I’d like to take you out Friday night,” he said, as I walked closer to where he stood on the corner. His looks matched his confidence.  “I don’t know you well enough” I said, not falling too easily for this good-looking stranger.</i><div><p></p></div><div><i>Being quite the charmer, his Plan B came so naturally. “Let’s group date,” he suggested. “My cousins are coming down this weekend. Get a few of your girlfriends together.”  I didn’t want to impulsively say yes, but there was something about him that I just couldn’t refuse. I found out later that he knew the girls I worked with so well because he had dated all of them at some point. So here I was, no different than the other girls, willfully being lured into his trance of charisma. That Friday night my girlfriends and I met him and his friends across the river at a good place to kick back and dance. We spent hours either on the dance floor or talking at the bar.   I figured this was just another date to him. But surprisingly, before the weekend could end, he was calling me to go out again. This time, he picked me up from home, and we went back across the river. The places there were known for their chaos-free vibes, great music for dancing, drinks, and no charge at the doors. As the sun went down that Sunday evening, our conversation seemed to have only gained momentum.  “I want to take you to meet my mother,” he insisted.  “Um, right now?” I asked, still trying to believe his spontaneity   “Yes, right now!”  Excited about extending our night together, I agreed, and minutes later, we were pulling up to the Mancuso’s residence. The smell of savory spices met us at the door. Ms. Giovanni, who the family called Jenny, happened to be announcing dinnertime as we walked further inside. With the same breath she introduced herself, she kindly asked me to stick around to eat. She was a heavy set lady who loved to cook, and thankfully, she was phenomenal at it. Her sweet, welcoming personality was purely pleasant to be around. Meeting his father, Mr. Joseph, on the other hand, it was easy to see where my date got his charming characteristics from. Joe, a tall, slim man with the same black, curly hair and dark complexion as his son, was a bit flirtatious, almost that of a womanizer.   As we sat down for dinner, his parents weren’t the only two to join us. Charles and John, his twelve-year-old twin brothers, came racing to the table. At the first sight of them, I thought they were identical. Later, I noticed that Charles was a little heavier than John. They were two kids of pure entertainment and skilled at giving me those good gut laughs. There was nothing uncomfortable about being in their home. I enjoyed myself from the moment I came through the door.  That night, I had my very first Italian dinner – the rich, mouth-watering flavors whipped into her meal were incomparable. Living with French and German parents meant dishes like artichoke, for instance, didn’t make the menu. Besides the difference in our culture of food, I easily noted that their family values were very similar to those of my mother and I, including their Catholic beliefs.  “We’re taking the twins to a drive-in movie,” she said aloud, directing her words towards me. “Junell, you come on with us.”  Sitting amongst the remarkably hospitable Mancuso’s, I was elated she invited me along.  It was our third date of the night, and I couldn’t have been happier or wished for a better first experience with someone’s family. Yet, I refused to carry any expectations for this guy. I remembered how love failed me before, so as far as I was concerned, he could have changed at any minute. “If my whole family wasn’t watching, I’d kiss you good night right now,” he whispered. <br/></i></div><div>
<i>The twins hadn’t looked away long enough to give us any privacy. But I felt the urge in his eyes, and if the moment had presented itself, I knew he would have gone for it. Despite my need to take things slow, I actually wanted to kiss him just as bad.  From that day on, my weekends were taken.  Little did I know, seventeen-year-old Francis Mancuso would become my hero. <br/></i><p> </p>

I found out later that he knew the girls I worked with so well because he had dated all of them at some point. So here I was, no different than the other girls, willfully being lured into his trance of charisma. That Friday night my girlfriends and I met him and his friends across the river at a good place to kick back and dance. We spent hours either on the dance floor or talking at the bar.   I figured this was just another date to him. But surprisingly, before the weekend could end, he was calling me to go out again. This time, he picked me up from home, and we went back across the river. The places there were known for their chaos-free vibes, great music for dancing, drinks, and no charge at the doors. As the sun went down that Sunday evening, our conversation seemed to have only gained momentum.  “I want to take you to meet my mother,” he insisted.  “Um, right now?” I asked, still trying to believe his spontaneity   “Yes, right now!”  Excited about extending our night together, I agreed, and minutes later, we were pulling up to the Mancuso’s residence. The smell of savory spices met us at the door. Ms. Giovanni, who the family called Jenny, happened to be announcing dinnertime as we walked further inside. With the same breath she introduced herself, she kindly asked me to stick around to eat. She was a heavy set lady who loved to cook, and thankfully, she was phenomenal at it. Her sweet, welcoming personality was purely pleasant to be around. Meeting his father, Mr. Joseph, on the other hand, it was easy to see where my date got his charming characteristics from. Joe, a tall, slim man with the same black, curly hair and dark complexion as his son, was a bit flirtatious, almost that of a womanizer.   As we sat down for dinner, his parents weren’t the only two to join us. Charles and John, his twelve-year-old twin brothers, came racing to the table. At the first sight of them, I thought they were identical. Later, I noticed that Charles was a little heavier than John. They were two kids of pure entertainment and skilled at giving me those good gut laughs. There was nothing uncomfortable about being in their home. I enjoyed myself from the moment I came through the door.  That night, I had my very first Italian dinner – the rich, mouth-watering flavors whipped into her meal were incomparable. Living with French and German parents meant dishes like artichoke, for instance, didn’t make the menu. Besides the difference in our culture of food, I easily noted that their family values were very similar to those of my mother and I, including their Catholic beliefs.  “We’re taking the twins to a drive-in movie,” she said aloud, directing her words towards me. “Junell, you come on with us.”  Sitting amongst the remarkably hospitable Mancuso’s, I was elated she invited me along.  It was our third date of the night, and I couldn’t have been happier or wished for a better first experience with someone’s family. Yet, I refused to carry any expectations for this guy. I remembered how love failed me before, so as far as I was concerned, he could have changed at any minute. “If my whole family wasn’t watching, I’d kiss you good night right now,” he whispered. 
The twins hadn’t looked away long enough to give us any privacy. But I felt the urge in his eyes, and if the moment had presented itself, I knew he would have gone for it. Despite my need to take things slow, I actually wanted to kiss him just as bad.  From that day on, my weekends were taken.  Little did I know, seventeen-year-old Francis Mancuso would become my hero.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

book about magic cures. It won’t tell you about secret foods to feed a child to
make their autism go away. It won’t tell you how to get back a child that was
stolen by autism. It won’t talk about how children are being poisoned into
being autistic either. Plenty of people get trapped on the dark side of an
information black hole after a child has been diagnosed with autism. There the
conversations are laced with anger about what has been done to make a child
autistic, to rob someone of a “normal” child. Receiving a diagnosis of autism
for a child can be a devastating event. But it doesn’t have to be. Whether you
are a parent of an autistic child, a parent of an autistic adult (yes autistic
children grow up to be autistic adults), or an autistic person yourself there
is beauty in autism. I hope to give you the clarity to see the treasure there
is in relationships with autistic people.</p>

I’ve spent more than a decade now parenting with
a life time yet to go. It’s been a wild ride so far and things are sure to get
even more interesting as my children (autistic and neurotypical) grow older.
While I haven’t seen everything under the sun I have seen quite a bit, and
encountered some interesting characters, while learning about autism and caring
for my children. This is my effort to give back some of the wisdom that was
given to me. In creating this project I drew on the experiences of other

We want vaulting to expand and develop in Argentina.Besides, it would be the opportunity for the National Vaulting Team Members to represent Argentina in the most important equestrian competition in the world.In order to achieve it, we count on your help. Most of the Team’s athletes receive scholarships from the Argentine Equestrian Federation and the German Equestrian Club which allow them to practice the discipline but which unfortunately do not cover the costs implied in their participation in the WEG. Thanks to your contribution, the athletes would be able to travel and delight the rest of the world with their talent.Argentina can be represented in the next World Equestrian Games and we lie on your support for that.  Join us!¿Para qué es el dinero?

I teach elementary school and work in summer camps. I've been married for five years and have a six-month-old baby. I love comic books, role playing games, playing music and performing. And I write.</p>
<p>This past March I published my first novel, Deadly Troubadours as an ebook and I want to make it available as a paperback. If I were in America, my home country, I would just upload it to a print on demand publisher. But, here in Japan, that is not an option. To make Deadly Troubadours available in the country in which I live I am going to need to print a batch.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>My wife, who also serves as the artist for the book, and I have been contacting printers in the Tokyo area. We have found one we like and they have quoted us an initial price of 100 copies for $1100, well actually 130,000yen but you get the idea. That make the unit copy $11. I want to sell it for $15 so I can make enough off each book to have a nice cup of coffee for each book sold.</p>
<p>To be honest, that same print company has quoted a starting price of 200 copies for $1500 (180,000yen). So, yeah the more we print the more I make, the better the coffee. </p>
<p>Okay, so I'm not going to spend the money all on advertising. I'm sure some of the cash will go into groceries and diapers for the munchkin, but I also want to be able to advertise on Facebook and drive some traffic to my website and to this campaign. That costs money. Facebook tells me if I want five clicks on my page I should be prepared to spend about $5 a day. If I do that for the entire campaign, that's $150 dollars. </p>
<p>So, basically this is going for printing and advertising.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>I want to put this book in peoples hands. I know a lot of us are slowly converting to ebooks. But I have been surprised at the amount of friends and acquaintances who have told me they would like to give it a shot, but they don't like reading for pleasure on monitors. If I can provide a physical copy, that is another outlet for people to read my book.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>This book will be made. The book is already out there as an ebook and since March there have been readers who have let me know areas that need typos removed, which is something that will be implemented with this version. I've already got money squirreled away to print off at least 100 copies. This campaign is to help spread the word and to help me find readers. And, honestly, to print off as many copies as I can without having boxes of books fill my living room. The wife has already told me that isn't an option.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Spread the word! Share on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, other social network services I don't understand. Tell your roleplaying group. Tell the guys and gals at your local comic shop. Tell your bandmates and troupe mates.</p>
<p>Go to Goodreads and mark Deadly Troubadours as ""want to read."" If you have read it review it anywhere and everywhere. Get on iTunes and download the audio podcast ""Reading Deadly Troubadours"" and review and share that. </p>

<h3><strong>Short Summary</strong></h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Elizabeth Godley. I have been working with children for over 10 years as a caretaker, mentor, fairy, clown and friend. I am a kid magnet. Seriously, I cannot go into a park without at least 3 kids around me wanting to join in on the fun. Writing a children's book is a long held dream of mine and it's so close to coming true! You are helping it become a reality.</p>
<p>My book has a wonderful message about how change happens to everyone and the solution to the struggle is love, love for yourself and others. </p>
<p>Ribbon, a bright 7 year old, traveling with her father, encounters a group of bizarre individuals in need of simple guidance. Her new friends become part of her family. The group of characters featured are both ethnically and culturally diverse in order to illustrate that families come in all varieties, with the connecting key ingredient- love.</p>
<p>It is a heartwarming, silly, funny story with a dash of magic! </p>
<p>The Traveling Castle is magical with a wonderful play room that contains hundreds of bubbles in the air, an art section where you can draw on anything, a slide, swings, a garden, a river, a noise section where everything makes funny noises, a trampoline, a cozy book reading corner with a rocking chair and thousands of books and more!</p>
<p>There are funny made up words that make grownups sound silly when they read them out loud. A favorite among the kids I've read the book to. Silly grownups are hilarious, right?!  </p>
<p>I am publishing with Amazon.</p>
<p>The Illustrator is Paige Murray-Ley of Hue Creative. She is fantastic, as you can see.</p>
<h3><strong>What I Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>The money I raise here will go directly to publishing costs with Amazon, as well as paying Paige Murray-Ley of Hue Creative for her wonderful work and time.</p>
<p>Possible prizes are: </p>

<p>Sheltering Books, Inc is a 501 (c)(3) charity that provides quality children's books to homeless shelters across the US. Founded by Mackenzie Bearup.</p>

<p>Tijdens de jaarlijkse Koningsspelen volgen Nederlandse basisscholen een
programma bestaand uit een gezamenlijk ontbijt en een spelletjesdag. Deelname
voor leerlingen is verplicht, en ook scholen voelen zich onder druk gezet om
mee te doen. Onder het mom van ‘samen bewegen’ wordt zo het Koningshuis in het
zonnetje gezet.</p>
<p><b><i>Zulke propaganda hoort niet op scholen thuis.</i></b></p>
<p>We
hebben in Nederland een club speciaal voor dit soort gelegenheden: de
Oranjeverenigingen. Als zij de Koningsspelen voortaan organiseren, worden
scholen niet overbelast en zijn kinderen niet leerplichtig.</p>
<p>Help ons om de Koningsspelen weer vrijwillig te maken. Laat iedereen
#zelfkiezen of ze mee willen doen!</p>
<h2><b>Leerplichtig</b></h2>
<p>Leerlingen van een school die meedoet aan de Koningsspelen zijn
leerplichtig en mogen dus
niet thuisblijven.</p>
<p>VVD-wethouder
Ronald Louwman uit Hoorn besloot in 2014 dat in zijn gemeente de
leerplichtambtenaar niet zal worden ingeschakeld: ""Niemand wordt verplicht
om naar het staatshoofd te zwaaien. Het is hier Noord-Korea niet.” Echter,
Nederland heeft meer weg van Noord-Korea dan Louwman dacht. In de gemeenten Amsterdam,
Rotterdam, Den Haag, Groningen, Utrecht, Nijmegen, Almere, Breda, Tilburg en
Eindhoven moeten kinderen verplicht meedoen aan de Koningsspelen.</p>
<p>Ook
scholen worden onder druk gezet om mee te doen. De vele brieven die organisator
Richard Krajicek en staatssecretaris Sander Dekker van Onderwijs, Cultuur en
Wetenschappen vorig jaar stuurden, gaven veel directeuren en directrices de
indruk dat de Koningsspelen ook voor scholen verplicht is.</p>
<p>En dat
terwijl propaganda voor de monarchie helemaal niet op scholen thuishoort. Als
schoolboeken politieke standpunten uitdragen, worden daar altijd kamervragen
over gesteld – behalve als het om het Koningshuis gaat! Dat willen we veranderen.</p>
<p><b>Wij vragen jouw hulp </b>om de leerplicht voor
22 april op te schorten, en basisscholen van de “morele verplichting” van de
Koningsspelen te bevrijden. Zodat iedereen weer zelf kan kiezen of hij of zij
mee wil doen aan de schone schijn van de monarchie.</p>
<h2><b>€5,000 om dit onderwerp op de kaart te zetten</b></h2>
<p>We willen dat meer gemeentes (net zoals in Hoorn) besluiten om de
leerplicht voor de Koningsspelen op te heffen. Op die manier kunnen ouders hun
kinderen thuishouden als zij niet mee willen doen aan de koninklijke
propaganda.</p>
<p>Daarnaast willen we dat plaatselijke Oranjeverenigingen de organisatie van
de Koningsspelen overnemen van scholen, zodat die hun tijd en aandacht kunnen
besteden aan goed onderwijs – en aan sportdagen en andere activiteiten.</p>
<p>Om dit te bereiken moet de druk op gemeentes en de organisatie van de
Koningsspelen worden opgevoerd. Daarom willen we dit onderwerp op de agenda
zetten via media, sociale media, en lokale acties.</p>
<h2><b>Wat wij willen doen</b></h2><p><span>De Koningsspelen kunnen helaas niet van de ene op
de andere dag worden veranderd. Het onderwerp moet eerst op de agenda komen, en
<b>dat kunnen wij doen, met jouw hulp! </b>We hebben budget nodig zodat we:</span></p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Raadsleden in lokale gemeenten kunnen benaderen.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Journalisten kunnen inlichten over de zwarte kant

<p>·<span> 
</span>Een grootscheepse brievenactie op touw kunnen
zetten.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Kunnen investeren in onderzoek naar alternatieve
oplossingen voor scholen.</p>
<p>·<span> 
</span>Digitale content kunnen creëren om dit issue via
social media onder honderdduizenden Nederlanders te verspreiden.</p>
<p>Ook als we onverhoopt niet de 5.000€ halen,
zullen we het geld besteden aan onderdelen van het project, en ondertussen
proberen elders budget vandaan te halen. Maar we hopen misschien wel over de 5.000
heen te gaan! In dat geval kunnen we het extra geld besteden aan gerelateerde
campagnes, allemaal gericht op het democratisch gekozen staatshoofd dat Nederland verdient. </p>
<p></p>
<h2><b>Samen maken we het verschil</b></h2>
<p>We doen dit voor jullie. Iedereen in Nederland hoort het recht te hebben om
zelf te kiezen welke staatsvorm hij steunt. Niemand mag worden verplicht om mee
te doen aan een spelletjesdag ter ere van de koning. </p>
<p>De monarchie is een achterhaald, ondemocratisch en geldverslindend
instituut dat via de Koningsspelen (en via vele andere promotiestunts) een
schone schijn probeert op te houden. </p>
<p>Deze campagne wil dit probleem op de agenda zetten. Samen kunnen we zorgen
dat onze stem gehoord wordt, en het probleem opgelost.</p>
<p>Het Nieuw Republikeins Genootschap strijdt al jaren voor een democratisch
gekozen staatshoofd. We willen dat onderwerp bespreekbaar maken, niet alleen
voor onze leden maar voor alle Nederlanders. </p>
<p>Laten we samen het verschil maken!</p>
<h2><b>Een grote uitdaging</b></h2>
<p>Kranten hebben het dwingende karakter van de Koningsspelen lange tijd
genegeerd in hun berichtgeving. Een goede mediahype kan ertoe leiden dat meer
gemeenten de leerplicht opschorten voor de Koningsspelen. Daarom is ons eerste

<p>Writer, speaker, and advocate Lucia Rios uses her personal and professional experience with disability to increase awareness of the disability experience. Lucia is currently writing a book that will tell her story through the lens of several critical themes, including identity, disability, and maximizing your opportunities no matter what abilities you have. The book will run approximately 140 pages and be available on Amazon in print and Kindle formats.</p>
<p>
</p><h3>Lucia's Speaking</h3>
<p>Lucia has already built a website, <a href=""http://luciarios.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">luciarios.com</a>, to help promote her book and create opportunities for her to speak to groups. In her speaking, Lucia shares her experiences with people with disabilities and their friends and family. She shares her perspective on how to shift attitudes and maximize the contributions people with disabilities make in the world. Lucia's goal is to <b>raise $5,000 to cover the costs</b> of creating her book, as well as initial efforts to build speaking opportunities.</p>

<p></p><ul>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>Disability Is Not Identity. </b>Lucia and other people with disabilities don’t want to be primarily defined by or known for their disabilities. It is not the most interesting aspect of their lives. She and they want to be recognized for their abilities first—what they can do, not what they cannot.</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>Success Is Not About Where You Start, but How You Finish. </b>Everyone is born with a portfolio of assets and liabilities. Some, like extraordinary physical abilities or disabilities, are obvious. Some, like family systems or circumstances, are less obvious to others. But success is not looking backwards and cataloging your limitations; it’s about doing well with your life, performing the tasks given you, and maximizing your opportunities.</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>I Am Not a Representative of a Category. </b>Lucia and others don’t want to be known as a racial minority or disabled person. That is dehumanizing. They want to be known as a complete and regular person, a mix of strengths and weaknesses, accomplishments and disappointments.</span></li>
<li><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><b>I Am Not Your Inspiration.</b> Not everything I do is amazing, and I don’t need applause or admiration for living my life.

</ul></div>","A Book by Lucia Rios
Writer, speaker, and advocate Lucia Rios uses her personal and professional experience with disability to increase awareness of the disability experience. Lucia is currently writing a book that will tell her story through the lens of several critical themes, including identity, disability, and maximizing your opportunities no matter what abilities you have. The book will run approximately 140 pages and be available on Amazon in print and Kindle formats.

Lucia's Speaking
Lucia has already built a website, luciarios.com, to help promote her book and create opportunities for her to speak to groups. In her speaking, Lucia shares her experiences with people with disabilities and their friends and family. She shares her perspective on how to shift attitudes and maximize the contributions people with disabilities make in the world. Lucia's goal is to raise $5,000 to cover the costs of creating her book, as well as initial efforts to build speaking opportunities.

More About Lucia's Book
The book will tell Lucia's personal story through the lens of several critical themes:

Disability Is Not Identity. Lucia and other people with disabilities don’t want to be primarily defined by or known for their disabilities. It is not the most interesting aspect of their lives. She and they want to be recognized for their abilities first—what they can do, not what they cannot.
Success Is Not About Where You Start, but How You Finish. Everyone is born with a portfolio of assets and liabilities. Some, like extraordinary physical abilities or disabilities, are obvious. Some, like family systems or circumstances, are less obvious to others. But success is not looking backwards and cataloging your limitations; it’s about doing well with your life, performing the tasks given you, and maximizing your opportunities.
I Am Not a Representative of a Category. Lucia and others don’t want to be known as a racial minority or disabled person. That is dehumanizing. They want to be known as a complete and regular person, a mix of strengths and weaknesses, accomplishments and disappointments.
I Am Not Your Inspiration. Not everything I do is amazing, and I don’t need applause or admiration for living my life. Don’t reduce me to to a symbol or theme.
I Am Not Angry, and I Don’t Feel Sorry for Myself. Don’t assume that I’m bitter and want to change your organization or values. I’m happy to live the life I’ve been given, and I can and do choose to be a happy person. And don’t pity me or overcompensate your behavior to make me overly special.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Growing up as a student-athlete, Jasmine was always perceived as more of the student than an athlete. At the most average of average height of 5'5”, Jasmine may have done better in any sport other than basketball. But the athleticism, discipline, and mental grit from her team sports days provided the foundation for Jasmine's new love of swimming, cycling, and running. Her claim to fame is getting 1st in her age-group at her first Olympic-distance duathlon race and absconding all the Tate's Cookie's provided afterwards. In two rookie triathlon seasons, Jasmine finished 4 Olympics, 2 half Ironmans, and 4 Ironman distance races, including Ironman World Championships in Kona. She currently races for Wattie Ink's Elite Team. When Jasmine is not training or eating, she is talking to anyone that will listen to her about multi-sport, sprinkled in with other worldly topics.<br/><br/>For all you social media butterflies, you can connect with Jasmine at @jas.chou on instagram or read more race reports at jaschou.com.</p>

<p><strong>Story of My Book</strong></p>
<p>Banish the Darkness is a young adult fantasy novel that centers on three humans that must save two worlds, including their own, from the control of a cruel King. Along the way, they learn of their own strengths and weaknesses, and must come to terms with the fact that nothing will be the same again.<br/><br/>My name is Ollie Monteleone and I am the author of Banish the Darkness. I wrote this book because I’ve always wanted to be an author, and since I dreamt up this idea in 2017, I knew I wanted to share it with the world.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will be able to step outside reality and explore the worlds I’ve created, and the characters that inhabit them. I want you to see this book as a chance to witness the choices each character makes, and observe how it impacts the plot, as well as their own arcs, as they are unable to escape from the consequences of their actions. <br/><br/>You will love this book if you enjoy young adult fantasy novels with well-developed characters, complicated plot lines, and deep, often morally grey, villains. <br/><br/>Banish the Darkness speaks to fantasy lovers and allies and members of the LGTBQ+ community, who want to grapple with issues involving family in a new way and overcoming moral dilemmas from a different perspective.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Banish the Darkness inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<p>How can I help others while remaining true to myself?</p>
<p>How important are blood family and chosen family in people’s lives?</p>
<p>How can we better ourselves by normalizing those different from us? </p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing chosen family vs blood family, being true to yourself, embracing your differences, and always fighting for the betterment of ourselves and others will change us all for the better. <br/> <p><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

Since 2011, Women Who Submit has supported women and non-binary writers in 14 states and three countries through the submission process. Our bimonthly submission parties in Los Angeles and our chapter meetings across the country continually bring in new writers who are ready to get published. Your contribution helps us create spaces where women and non-binary writers can share submission strategies, encourage each other’s work, and break barriers to publication. We have expanded our mission over the years and empowered writers to apply to residencies, fellowships, and conferences as well.With your contribution, we can bring in leaders from the writing community to deliver panels and workshops on topics like finding an agent, creating an author website, submitting to contests, and applying to residencies. We can secure public, accessible spaces in which to host our bi-monthly submission parties. We can continue awarding submission fee stipends, which is another way of breaking financial barriers that writers often struggle with. We can also utilize live-streaming and transcription services to make our workshops more accessible to those who can’t be with us physically because of transportation barriers and/or disabilities. We can present on these issues at national conferences, such as AWP, furthering our mission to make space for marginalized voices in literature.Your contribution will go to our 501(c)3 fiscal sponsor, Avenue 50 Studios.Women Who Submit is about community. We empower and encourage the writers in our community to break their own barriers to submission, and we advocate for a publishing landscape that is welcoming and accessible to ALL communities. Will you join our community and help make our 2020 goals possible? About Women Who SubmitWomen Who Submit seeks to empower women and non-binary writers by creating physical and virtual spaces for sharing information, supporting and encouraging submissions to literary journals, and clarifying the submission and publication process. WWS HistoryWomen Who Submit began with the idea of a submission party—the brainchild of founding member Alyss Dixson—as a response to the VIDA count, which illustrated just how vastly underrepresented women are in Tier 1 literary journals. Other founding members, Ashaki Jackson and Xochitl-Julisa Bermejo, were brought in to help plan the first ever submission party held in Xochitl-Julisa’s mom’s kitchen (thanks, mom!) in July 2011. On that day six women ate quiche, created a sharing library of lit journals, set goals, asked for feedback on cover letters, and sent off submissions. WWS in virtual spaceOur Facebook page, Twitter feed, YouTube channel, and blog are tools WWS uses to continue its mission to empower women and non-binary writers to submit their work to literary magazines for publication. It is completely open to any and all writers who are seeking online support and information. We also use these outlets to promote future projects and public events.WWS in physical spaceThe submission party is how this group began, and we continue to join together in each other’s homes and public venues to share, support, and submit. What is this money for? Speaker Fees $600Submission Fee Grant $600Event Space $1,200Planning Meeting: $350Refreshments $200Supplies $100Website Maintenance $200Transcription $600Marketing $550Event Host: $300Orientation Leader: $800Administrative costs (Indiegogo's fees, shipping, etc): $500 More perks will continue to be rotated in during the campaign so check back for updates! Claps and cheers of gratitude for our fiscal sponsor, grant funders, community members and perk donors:California Arts CouncilCenter for Cultural InnovationAvenue 50 StudiosEugene Owens and the Dr. Mary McLeod Bethune Regional Branch of the LA Public LibraryJessica Ceballos y CampbellKate MaruyamaJack Jones Literary ArtsBook ShowKaya PressJaded Ibis PressUnnamed PressSundress PublicationsHyacinth Girl PressLibroMobileMinal HajratwalaOtherwildUrban 728 YogaGracie's PizzaThe FacultyTasty's Juice BarJessica BixelWendy C.

<h3>THANK YOU!</h3>
<p>It is a tremendous blessing to have the project fully funded! Work on the Epistle Book is underway, and will kick into high gear after Pascha.</p>
<p>We will continue to accept contributions, which will be put towards the third volume in our series, the <i>Prophetologion</i>, the liturgical Old Testament of the Orthodox Church. We will continue to update the Acknowledgements page in the printed Epistle Book with additional names until we go to press. </p>
<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p><a href=""http://ignatius.cc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Saint Ignatius Orthodox Press</a> grew out of our <a href=""http://www.ignatius.cc/publications-gospel.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gospel Book</a> project, the incredible reception to which we have been incredibly blessed by.</p>
<p>With the Gospel Book (now approaching sellout on the first edition!), our goal was to publish a book we desired for our own prayer corners: a dignified, beautiful book of the Gospels with a sacred look and feel, which contains a detailed, pan-Orthodox lectionary, well-suited for both church and home use. We accomplished this with the incredible support of over 50 individuals.</p>
<p>Of course, the story of our faith does not end with the Ascension of our Lord. The Epistle Book is the companion to our Gospel Book, and that is what this campaign is about.</p>
<p>We will be using the same excellent <i>English/Greek Orthodox Bible</i> (EOB) translation as the Gospel Book, which is based on the official Patriarchal Text of the Orthodox Church, and is both dignified and accessible in its translation style. It will have the same form factor and beautiful styling. All of this contributes to a book which truly looks and feels important, dignified, and holy.</p>

<h3>Breakdown</h3>
<p>We are seeking to raise $15,000 to fund the printing of 1000 copies of the Epistle Book.</p>
<p>More than two-thirds of this goal covers the hard printing costs—which are significant for the high-quality materials and printing quality that we require for this holy book, in the estimated 500 page length.</p>
<p>The other one-third covers a royalty due to the EOB translation and costs associated with layout and design. (Being about 20% longer than the Gospel Book, there is also 20% more text and graphics to prepare.) We also have a minimal amount of overhead and we need to offset Indiegogo's payment processing fees.</p>
<p>Donors will receive some wonderful perks—best of all, copies of the printed book, and more. See the full breakdown.</p>
<p>If we don't raise the full $15,000 in this campaign, we will set aside the funds and continue our fundraising efforts outside of Indiegogo until we are able to proceed with the project. It took about four months to raise the funds for our Gospel Book, but with your help, we hope to make it within Indiegogo's 60 day window.</p>
<p><strong>Stretch Goals!</strong></p>
<p>If we happen to raise more than $15,000, those funds will be put toward the next additions to the library of books we are building, including our upcoming companion Prophetologion: the liturgical Old Testament of the Orthodox Church. We are excited to expand this library, and we hope that you will continue to support Saint Ignatius Orthodox Press in these efforts to produce high-quality texts. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Gospel Book has only been available for a few months, but we are approaching sellout! We have heard from donors and buyers who are incredibly touched by the book they received. Here are just a few samples of the five-star reviews we have received:</p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>Beautiful, powerful, full of grace, the best English translation available... Everything I could want in a Gospel. Glory to God!</i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>It’s a fitting volume for the life and teachings of our Lord and Savior. The quality binding and four ribbon markers sets it apart from so many others. </i></p>
<p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>It is a treasure to have, to read, to use for meditation and to share with others. Thank you very much.</i></p>
<p>Lives are being impacted and spirits are being lifted through the words of Our Lord. This is the impact that you, the contributor, will have with the Epistle Book project, as it joins the Gospel Book as a beautiful matching set in homes and churches around the world.</p>
<p>A sacred book is not something that will be easily tossed aside and forgotten. With a liturgical calendar through the year 2100, and a timeless value that comes with the Holy Scriptures, your contributions will touch lives for a lifetime and many decades to come.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with the Gospel Book project was our unfamiliarity with the publishing process on this scale. Having been through it, we are confident that things will run smoothly as we move through the process and keep you updated along the way. With God's help, every challenge can be overcome when we working for Him.</p>

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Esther Leung, wife and mother of 3 children. My family immigrated to Canada in the 90s from Hong Kong. In this book I will share my story and struggles as a child immigrating to a new country, it will describe some of the cultural clash and identity crisis I encounter. As I grew up I have the honour of meeting Indigenous people who became my friends, I learned about their culture and stories including their personal experience in residential school. This is one of the major turning points in my life that opened my eyes to see the suffering and resilience of Indigenous people here in Canada. The story will also describe how it transforms my identity as I  learn to embrace my own cultural roots. </p>
<p>While this can be a heavier subject for a children's book, but there are valuable lessons that I think children can understand even at a young age. It is never too young to educate especially through stories. The target age group will be for children 5 - 10. Parents and teachers can read this story together with the younger ones. </p>
<p>My dream is even if one child can relate to the struggles, one child can see themselves as part of this story, one child can see their classmates going through this journey, one child has gained more empathy and understanding, then my goals for this book have been achieved! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What inspired me</h3>
<p>Earlier in 2019, I saw an infographic online about the lack of diversity there are in children's book characters. Did you know that only 7% of America’s children’s books use Asian characters and only 1% have Indigenous characters? Less than 25% of the books are written to reflect children of colour and visible minorities. </p>
<p>After posting this “infographic” on social media a friend challenged me to be part of the solution. While I cannot represent all children of colour but at least I can represent my own heritage and my own story. After talking to my family and they are supportive of this, the wild idea of me writing this book was birth nearing my 40th birthday! </p>

<h3>What is needed</h3>
<p>For this project, I need to raise $5000 for printing, shipping, art/illustrations, editing, marketing and related cost. </p>
<ul>
<li>The uniqueness of our perks packages is that it includes donating books to inner-city children and underpriviledged children in rural areas globally. </li>
<li>If you contribute $500 or more you will receive a name acknowledgement in the book itself.  </li>
</ul>
<h3>The Impact - Your contributions would mean</h3>
<ul>
<li>Sowing into diversity for children's books.  </li>
<li>Cultivate understanding, empathy and expanding the worldview of all who reads it </li>
<li>Learning about different cultures.  </li>
<li>Bringing awareness to the history of Indian Residential School.</li>
<li>Bringing awareness to the struggles of immigrants.</li>
<li>Donating this book to inner-city students and even children from rural areas with underprivileged backgrounds globally. This depends on the perks package you select. </li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risk and Challenges </h3>
<p>This is my first crowdfunding campaign, and first-time self-publishing, so there are inherent risks to the timeline of navigating unknowns. The expected date of book arrival is estimated by September 30th, 2020, approximately the time of having a pregnancy from right now! The book will be manufactured in China, so if there's a Chinese holiday or other events, that could potentially delay the bookbinding and shipping. While these are for the most part out of my control, I don't anticipate this will set us back by more than a few weeks at most.</p>

Hi, we are two master communication students at the University of Amsterdam with an ambitious and exciting project, so please read on!

Why we're doing what we're doing

In recent years, media have been very busy covering the big stories in Europe as it has been flooded with crises. First, the financial crash in Greece; then the civil war in Ukraine; followed by the influx of millions of migrants to Germany; lastly the terror attacks in Paris. These last few years in Europe have been unquestionably difficult. The media did not get one break between reporting. However, they mostly focused on governmental intervention, military action, even specific terrorists. 

We feel like in all these reports about these crises, in all the discussions and debates about politics, money and borders, something really important has been forgotten: There are people that deal with these crises – everyday. 
Who are these people whose lives have been changed in the blink of an eye?
We'd like to find out.

This is our plan

In the coming year we are planning to travel to four places in Europe that have been hit by a crisis recently.  
We will spend one week in Paris (France), one week in Passau (Germany), one week in Kiev (Ukraine) and one week in Athens (Greece).
We want to get to know these places and most importantly the people, their stories and their lives. Our goal is to paint the portraits of these individuals that have been impacted by crisis. We are hoping to find that beside all the differences in European culture, finances and politics, we all share the same dreams, fears and hopes for ourselves and our families.
Our dream is to share this experience with the rest of the world in the form of a narrative book that tells the unique story of specific individuals' lives that neither many Europeans nor foreigners really know about.   We need your help!
Travel budget:

Train to Paris 100,- Euro p.p.
Flight to Athens 250,- Euro p.p.
Flight to Kiev 250,- Euro p.p.
Flight to Munich and train to Passau 120,- Euro p.p.
Transportation at location ca. 260 Euro


Why support us?
It took a lot of courage for us to put the idea into motion, as we are aware that this project requires a lot of time, resources and dedication. However, now we are sure that we can bring this project to life because...   Good karma :)
We have amazing friends and supporters in each country We have academic backgrounds in sociology, political communication and media studies
We have publishing and writing contacts
We are hard workers, highly motivated and enthusiastic

<p>Story Excerpt:</p>
<p>What is called a ‘day’ in the life of a prisoner starts at 6AM. The day begins at 6 because that is when the body that cooked in the furnace of the hot night separates itself from the mattress. Picture the fact that it is only possible to sleep on one’s side (deboka) since there isn’t enough space due to the 80-100 inmates in a room four by four meters.  The first duty after waking up is folding up one’s blanket length-wise and rolling up of the mattress carefully. The blankets are lined up beside the wall, and bed sheets and <i>gabis</i> (cotton blankets worn as shawls) are put into sacks.</p>
<p>The floor of the room is dusted first followed by sprinkling liquid detergent, then finally polished using rags, after cleaning the floor shines like the face of a well to do person.</p>
<p>One can’t visit the restroom after waking up or when nature calls. First the cell mates must line up and wait their turn. Unless the chief of the compound loudly announces the room’s turn to go, no one is allowed to visit the toilet. Visiting the toilet at the same time as inmates of another room is forbidden. By this method prison officials prevent the mixing of inmates from different rooms.</p>
<p>When the room number is called followed by a shout `To the lavatory`, inmates walk out with the sick first. Rolled up tissue paper is handed to each inmate by the prisoner economic committee. Flip flops are taken out of sacks and handed to inmates. These are among the items inmates do not have the right to own. Flip flops are taken out of sacks only when needed, otherwise they stay in the sacks outside the cell. They do not have owners, they belong to the room. As they are the property of the prison camp, they also can be taken to other rooms as well.</p>
<p>Unlike the Derge Central Investigations Office, the amount of time an inmate is allowed to stay at the lavatory is not limited; however, haste is always necessary. Inmates must be prepared for the day before the investigators begin work, they must return from the lavatory, eat, organize their belongings, and be patiently waiting for the feared call of one’s name. As a result, the norm every morning is to rush before facing the day whether it brings endless boredom, a move to another prison, a call to the investigation room, or the end of one’s life.</p>
<p>Back from the lavatory, an inmate washes his face, leaves his sandals at the gate and enters the cell. Then each has to sit in a line on the shining floor. Everyone has to sit with legs apart so that another inmate can have space to sit in between his legs. In this position, bread with tea or bread with just water is served for breakfast. The prayer of every prisoner is ‘let me see tomorrow, let me partake of another meal.’</p>

A Political Autobiography

(2004 Gregorian calendar)

 
Story:
Reviews of the Amharic version:
It is not often that we Ethiopians write and tell our compatriots history of our times as we have lived it.  This is a book that should be read and cherished by many.  Indeed, it deserves, in my opinion, to be translated into other tongues and thus made accessible to a wider readership.  
Reading it is truly a rewarding experience.

I read Ato Harka’s book, From Nairobi to the Jubilee Palace, with a curious mixture of relish, excitement, anger and profound sorrow.  The adventure, the drama, the suspense, and above all, the carnage and bloodletting, could rival those in any novel – but this is not a work of fiction.

I recently released the second book in my epic fantasy series, Anniversary of the Veil.  Now I am about to start writing Book 3, which will be the final book in the trilogy. <br/><br/>I started writing the Anniversary of the Veil series in November 2009. About 2 and a half years later, in March 2012, I self-published Protector, the first book in the series.  This was a childhood dream come true for me, as I had always wanted to be a writer and one day write and publish a book of my own.  Protector was very well received, and allowed me to finish the sequel, Decision Maker, in only 9 months.  <br/><br/>For Book 3 in the series, I want to go even faster. My final deadline is June 10, 2013.<br/><br/>To meet this deadline, I need some help from you. I will have to devote most of my time to writing and revising Book Three, if I am to complete it by early summer. <br/><br/>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
The money you donate will be used for the creation of the final book.  I will spend it on:<br/><br/>- A professional cover design and artwork ($300)<br/>- Professional Editing and proofreading ($400)<br/>- Expert eBook and print book formatting ($250)<br/>- Marketing and book launch advertising ($250)<br/><br/>

<div><strong>Special Backer Perks</strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>I've devised a number of backer perks, which I'm sure will be to your liking ;) Since this is Book 3 in the series, and the story might not make complete sense unless the books are read in order, the perks also include Book 1 and Book 2.  See the side bar for more details.<br/><br/>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact of Your Donation</h3>
<p>Most importantly, your donation will allow me to let go of the worry of how I will finance the production of the book. In this way I will be able to focus solely on the writing, and on making Anniversary of the Veil, Book 3 the best I can.</p>
In simpler words, what you are giving me is peace of mind and the knowledge that I can and will write my best book yet.</div>

<p>Duty versus love is the one battle warrior Kae doesn't know how to fight. Kae has trained his entire life to become an elite Protector of the Realm. But when he earns that honor he finds himself protecting something far greater: the Veil separating two worlds. On one side of the Veil lie untold stores of magic. On the Realm's side, magic is all but obliterated, and Kae is one of the few who can use it. The priests who secretly rule the Realm will do everything they can to control his growing magical abilities.

Strangers from the other side have kidnapped Issa to take her across the Veil and sacrifice her to strengthen it. Kae is the only one who can find her. If he goes after Issa, he loses everything he's worked so hard for. But if he chooses duty over love, Issa will die.</p>

<p>Kae, a warrior Protector, has followed Princess Issa across the Veil separating two worlds. They were told Issa will be a key player at the Anniversary of the Veil, but have been mislead! Kae will have to make a terrible choice when the Anniversary finally comes. He is the Decision Maker and will have to play a part in a ceremony that will join Issa's Life Force with her Other Half - but in so doing, it could leave her senseless or worse, dead. As the King fights to find his daughter, as the Priesthood is falling apart; Kae has to decide if he will kidnap the Princess to stop her Joining and force her into a life of unhappiness, or if he will allow her to Join and thereby leave her a mere shell of herself. Meanwhile friends and foes alike are showing only half-truths to both Kae and Issa. They must make the most important decision of a lifetime without enough knowledge. How can they know it will be the right one?</p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>Heir of Blood and Secrets is a dystopian young adult novel about a girl who chooses to be a hero.<br/><br/>Scylla has waited her entire life for an opportunity to prove herself. When her father is accused of a murder he did not commit, she eagerly embarks on a quest to clear his name. As she races to find the real killer before it’s too late, she begins to unearth the secrets hidden under the gilded exterior of her city, forcing her to question all that she’s ever known.<br/><br/>My name is Linda Xia and I am the author of Heir of Blood and Secrets. I first started writing this book when I was 14, because I wanted to tell a story about an ordinary girl who chooses to do extraordinary things. I found - and still find - the trope of the Chosen One frustrating, because there aren’t a lot of ancient prophecies in real life and I believe we can all choose to be heroes. We don’t need to wait to be chosen.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will begin to see that the world is so much more complex than we often realize and that it isn’t always clear what the right thing to do is. At its core, this is a book about coming of age in a world that is beautiful, brutal, and often inexplicable.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Book - Heir of Blood and Secrets</h3>
<p>In this book, the protagonist, Scylla, fights to exonerate her father, a politician who’s been accused of a murder she’s convinced he did not commit. Scylla’s been born into privilege.

Story of My Book
Heir of Blood and Secrets is a dystopian young adult novel about a girl who chooses to be a hero.Scylla has waited her entire life for an opportunity to prove herself. When her father is accused of a murder he did not commit, she eagerly embarks on a quest to clear his name. As she races to find the real killer before it’s too late, she begins to unearth the secrets hidden under the gilded exterior of her city, forcing her to question all that she’s ever known.My name is Linda Xia and I am the author of Heir of Blood and Secrets. I first started writing this book when I was 14, because I wanted to tell a story about an ordinary girl who chooses to do extraordinary things. I found - and still find - the trope of the Chosen One frustrating, because there aren’t a lot of ancient prophecies in real life and I believe we can all choose to be heroes. We don’t need to wait to be chosen.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will begin to see that the world is so much more complex than we often realize and that it isn’t always clear what the right thing to do is. At its core, this is a book about coming of age in a world that is beautiful, brutal, and often inexplicable.
 

The Book - Heir of Blood and Secrets
In this book, the protagonist, Scylla, fights to exonerate her father, a politician who’s been accused of a murder she’s convinced he did not commit. Scylla’s been born into privilege. But the world she grows up in is divided, not only be class, but by gender and race, and we see how these factors shape her journey and those of the people she interacts with as she struggles to come to terms with who her father really is.It’s set in the fictional city of Devovea, a place where the wealthy elite are held accountable to none and rampant corruption rages beneath the glossy exterior of the Castle. As Scylla is confronted with the truth about her birthright, she finds herself torn between returning to the life she’s always known and becoming the real hero she’s always wanted to be.You will love this book if you enjoy dystopian mysteries, driven, complex characters, and often wonder what our society could be. Heir of Blood and Secrets challenges you to consider how far you are willing to go, what you are willing to sacrifice, to do what needs to be done to forge a better world.Ultimately, I hope that Heir of Blood and Secrets inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, and leads readers to grapple with such questions as:

Why do I see the world the way that I do?
How does my perception of the world shape what I believe in and what I’m willing to fight for?
How can I choose to be a hero and give voice to those who should be heard but aren’t?

I look forward to exploring these questions and more with you. Looking at the parts of ourselves we may not be proud of is difficult and exhausting, but I believe doing so will change us all for the better.

<h3>
<i>Strive</i> is a nonfiction book/memoir about the reflections and life lessons that I learned while being a remote student during the COVID-19 pandemic. </h3>
<p>I'm Colleen, full time college student and the author of <i>Strive</i>. I was inspired to write <i>Strive</i> while taking my classes remotely. The pandemic cost students around the world countless opportunities and experiences: study abroads were cut short, proms were cancelled and graduations were reduced to pictures on a screen. </p>
<p>However, I felt that the silver lining of these circumstances was that students had the chance to be still. The pandemic gave us an unexpected break from reality that allowed for deep reflection and clarity of thought. My hope is that future generations of students, who will not have lived through a global pandemic, will be able to gain the insights regardlessly.</p>
<p>In this book, you'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>A capable consultant's journey of finding balance and fulfillment at work</li>
<li>A recent grad's adventures that led him to discover his love for Machine Learning</li>
<li>A college student's decision to take a gap semester after reevaluating his past motivations</li>

<p>Thank you for visiting the <b>Voices from War</b>  fundraising campaign site! By reaching our goal of $16,000, we will be able to compensate our instructors from the Fall 2014 writing workshop for veterans and Winter-Spring 2015 seasons and to print and distribute our first literary journal, <b><i>Voices from War, VOLUME 1</i></b>, with student work from our first two
seasons (2013-2014). Additionally, we want not only to maintain and sustain our current programming; in 2015 we hope to build capacity for more. <b>Voices from War (VFW)</b>  believes strongly in its mission to offer a respectful, craft-focused community for veterans to write—and working to bring these voices to a wider audience.<br/></p><p><b>Powerful stories offer us opportunities 
for insight and broader understanding. They demand it. They offer us 
ways to step out of our own experience<b>—</b>our own skin<b>—</b>to better comprehend ourselves and imagine 
ourselves into someone else's life and experiences. It is sometimes hard, and it is 
necessary.</b><br/></p><p>We care deeply about these stories—veteran stories—that they be told, however
each individual chooses, and created with the resources and support from an informed and
engaged community of instructors, industry professionals and peers. So, we have continued to grow our workshops and related outreach events, even without secure funding. Why? Because we knew we could build on the success of VFW's first year, working with an engaged and varied group of veterans. We hope you feel the same way!</p><p><b>PROGRAMMING &amp; FUNDING<br/></b></p>
<p><b><u>With a budget
of $7000 in 2013-2014, VFW was able to:</u></b></p>
<p><b><span>·<span> 
</span></span></b>Design two 10-week seasons of NYC
workshops and a 4-session Summer mini-season in our first year (2013-2014).</p>
<p><b><span>·<span> 
</span></span></b>Create and moderate an evening of
“Reading, Writing, &amp; Talking War” for VAP’s 2013 Arts &amp; Service
Celebration with Veteran Artist Program (VAP), welcoming an audience of 80-100
people. <i>We reprised this event on November 9, 2014, again collaborating with VAP, for “Journeys in Stories:
From the Front to the Home Front in Words”—with more than 200 attendees!</i></p>
<p><b><span>·<span> 
</span></span></b>Broaden our network and our commitment
to <b>EMPOWER veterans to craft their stories</b> and to <b>PROPEL their
stories into public sight</b>. Through this process, we engage with literary
arts and we bring voices from war—veteran voices—to a wider audience, fostering
dialogue between veterans and civilians.</p>
<p><b><u>With
your help, Voices from War hopes to:</u></b></p>
<p><b><span>·<span> 
</span></span></b>Publish our first collection of veteran
writing, <b><i>Voices from War, VOLUME 1</i></b>. Plus, we are partnering with
the Headstrong Project’s “Words of War” e-book to co-publish work from four Voices from War participants. </p>
<p><b><span>·<span> 
</span></span></b>Perform readings of select veteran
writing for a public audience.</p>
<p><b><span>·<span>

</span></span>Continue to help <b>Voices from War</b>
participants to publish their work in other forums—through support, educational
programming, personalized advice and mentoring. (In recent months, two

<p>We
are extremely grateful for the institutional support offered by the 14<sup>th</sup>
Street Y in Manhattan, home to our workshops each week, and for the grant
support from Poets &amp; Writers, Inc. (with public funds from the New York
State Council on the Arts). These supporters have helped us in forging
alliances and they have offered illustrations of tangible support from diverse
organizations believing in our mission, to empower veterans to craft their

<p>From everyone at the <b>Voices From War</b>
community, THANK
YOU!</p>
</div>","Thank you for visiting the Voices from War  fundraising campaign site! By reaching our goal of $16,000, we will be able to compensate our instructors from the Fall 2014 writing workshop for veterans and Winter-Spring 2015 seasons and to print and distribute our first literary journal, Voices from War, VOLUME 1, with student work from our first two
seasons (2013-2014). Additionally, we want not only to maintain and sustain our current programming; in 2015 we hope to build capacity for more. Voices from War (VFW)  believes strongly in its mission to offer a respectful, craft-focused community for veterans to write—and working to bring these voices to a wider audience.Powerful stories offer us opportunities 
for insight and broader understanding. They demand it. They offer us 
ways to step out of our own experience—our own skin—to better comprehend ourselves and imagine 
ourselves into someone else's life and experiences. It is sometimes hard, and it is 
necessary.We care deeply about these stories—veteran stories—that they be told, however
each individual chooses, and created with the resources and support from an informed and
engaged community of instructors, industry professionals and peers. So, we have continued to grow our workshops and related outreach events, even without secure funding. Why? Because we knew we could build on the success of VFW's first year, working with an engaged and varied group of veterans. We hope you feel the same way!PROGRAMMING & FUNDING
With a budget
of $7000 in 2013-2014, VFW was able to:
· 
Design two 10-week seasons of NYC
workshops and a 4-session Summer mini-season in our first year (2013-2014).
· 
Create and moderate an evening of
“Reading, Writing, & Talking War” for VAP’s 2013 Arts & Service
Celebration with Veteran Artist Program (VAP), welcoming an audience of 80-100
people. We reprised this event on November 9, 2014, again collaborating with VAP, for “Journeys in Stories:
From the Front to the Home Front in Words”—with more than 200 attendees!
· 
Broaden our network and our commitment
to EMPOWER veterans to craft their stories and to PROPEL their
stories into public sight. Through this process, we engage with literary
arts and we bring voices from war—veteran voices—to a wider audience, fostering
dialogue between veterans and civilians.
With
your help, Voices from War hopes to:
· 
Publish our first collection of veteran
writing, Voices from War, VOLUME 1. Plus, we are partnering with
the Headstrong Project’s “Words of War” e-book to co-publish work from four Voices from War participants. 
· 
Perform readings of select veteran
writing for a public audience.
· 
Continue our popular Voices from War
writing workshops in NYC at the 14th Street Y. And work with a NY-area Veterans Affairs in an effort to
establish an auxiliary Voices from War program.
· 
Continue to help Voices from War
participants to publish their work in other forums—through support, educational
programming, personalized advice and mentoring. (In recent months, two
participants published their first pieces of fiction and a third was accepted
for an esteemed writers' residency at Yaddo!)
· 
Continue to bring professional writers
and other publishing professionals as mentors to the Voices from War
workshops.*

<p><b>Short Summary</b></p><p>“Fail and fail better.” 
</p><p>“Fail forward”
</p><p>“My success has been built one failure at a time”
</p><p>We all hear the musings about failure and we agree that it’s sage advice. After all, mistakes are just part of our journey. But there hasn’t really been a roadmap that teaches people <i>how </i>to make the most of their bumps and bruises along the way. <b>Until now!!
</b></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/927755/files/20141013145056-Title_01_noun.jpg?1413237056"" src="""" style=""""/></p>As an international speaker, writer, teacher and certified life coach I’ve accumulated and developed some the most practical tools around and helped people across the globe meet their personal and professional goals. <p>I’ve taken the most effective and easiest to use methods I know and combined them into the life-transforming <i>FAIL to Win (For All Is Love)</i> program.  </p><p>I've helped CEOs, Foreign Exchange traders, Trauma/Illness survivors and many more ditch their paralyzing, default beliefs and build happy, fruitful lives and businesses based on their authenticity and intrinsic personal values. </p><div>
<b>                 This is more than motivation - this is practical application!</b><p></p>
<p><i></i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/927758/files/20141013145126-Title_02_verb.jpg?1413237086"" src="""" style=""""/></p>FAIL to Win is chock full of easy to learn, easy to execute tools and techniques that are specifically designed to slide right into your everyday life. Effecting real and lasting change in our lives takes time and practice and we’re more likely to use do what it takes when it is easy to add. 

<p>That’s why <i>FAIL to Win</i> is so transformative. It takes all of those things we know we “should” be doing and makes them doable. The idea is to integrate small shifts in order to create lasting results. 
</p>
<p><b>What I Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>The bulk of the amount being raised will go to editing. I’ve already chosen the best contextual editor around to help me make the book cohesive and easy, easy, easy to use and implement. I’ve got a second editor that will do the nuts and bolts pieces - I’d love to avoid the mental equivalent of the fingernails on the chalkboard by keeping my grammar and punctuation sound.  <span><br/></span>Current Editing Estimate: $2500 - 3000
</p>
<p>Additionally there is:
</p>
<p>Graphic and Interior design ~$1500
</p>
<p>I’ve budgeted for 250 books in the first round of printing ~$1000
</p>
<p>Ebook conversion is a flat fee =$250
</p>
<p>Estimated shipping ~$900
</p>
<p>Printing 100 spiral bound workbooks ~$900
</p>
<p><b>                          I want these tools in as many hands as possible!!</b></p>
<p><i>These perks are fun AND help you integrate the material for real and lasting change.</i></p>
<p>Contribution at any level includes <i>60 days FREE membership</i> to my Lovely Members program. That includes, in part, free coaching, archived recordings, access to wonderful people building great things in their lives while you begin conditioning heart and mind to all that is possible just for being an early adopter of the book and program. 
</p>
<p>Did you notice there are options that include powerful <i>one on one coaching</i>? 
</p>
<p>Inevitably, others interact differently with us when we evolve and improve our lives. Often, they want what we're having. That's why I included levels specifically designed to include family, friends and communities into the process with <i>additional materials meant for sharing</i>. 
</p>
<p>There are even options that include <i>FAIL to Win Seminars</i> for up to 50 people for people who are really serious about changing the direction of their organizations or management teams. (Workshops and Seminars need to either be within a 100 mile radius of Highlands Ranch or conducted via some virtual medium like Skype. Unless you're willing to pay travel expenses...then by all means...live and in-person it IS!)</p>
<p>I understand that this whole campaign could be it’s own anecdote for the next edition if I don’t meet my goal. Should that happen, the only thing that will change is the timeline. <span><br/></span>I will honor my promise to edit and print this book using my own personal funds as I can accommodate it which means it may take a little longer to pay for the bits and pieces. <span><br/></span>The benefits of the costs going straight to publishing and shipping expenses is that with fewer pre-purchases there is less of an investment in the first run and in mailing fees so I’m confident that it won’t be too much of a wait and I’ll stay in touch with you so you won’t be left hanging.

<b>The Impact
</b><p>Imagine that person who is absolutely ready commit to finding the peace within that builds the best possible future yet is afraid to make the investment in themselves. Their first tentative step would be a book that they could readily afford and work on privately. 
</p>
<p>The <i>FAIL to Win Tele Course</i> is currently priced to be highly accessible to people who are ready to create positive change in their lives. I understand, too, that there are people like I described who are ready for that transformation but to whom the course is still out of reach. 
</p>
<p><i>When you contribute to this campaign you not only get all of the benefits of being an early adopter and all of the perks that come with your contribution you also become instrumental in giving someone a chance at a new, empowered beginning in all of their endeavors</i>. You could be a hero!!</p>
<p><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>Let’s get real. In every opportunity there is risk. While it is not in my business plan to jump into a ceiling fan and concuss myself into amnesia, my deathly fear of spiders means that scenario is not entirely off of the table. So let’s talk about what happens when…
</p>
<p>We’ve already talked about what happens if the campaign is not fully funded
</p>
<p>     … some of that risk is mitigated by the fact that publishing and printing expenses decrease as well 
</p>
<p>     … making adjustments may push out the timeline a bit but I have great relationships with my team and have adjusted some other business expenditures to be able to set aside a bit of a safety net as well. 
</p>
<p>     … this book WILL get published. 
</p>
<p>I’m a perpetual learner and take advantage of continuing education opportunities. What happens if I learn new tools or make improvements to the program?
</p>
<p>     … the book hasn’t been edited yet so there is always time to add or change material to improve the product before delivery,
</p>
<p>     ... and if there's a way to bring you more - I will bring you more.</p>
<p>What if you hate the book?
</p>
<p>     … it’s quite simple, I’ll refund your money. Seriously though...hate?? I'd be surprised.</p>
<p>What if it gets lost in the mail?
</p>
<p>     … You and I will hold intent that it landed in the hands of the person who needed it most and I will send you another one.  
</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>I’m so glad you found <i>FAIL to Win </i>and are giving me the opportunity to be of service to you<i>. </i></p>
<p>I want these techniques readily available to anyone who is ready to change their story and their life and one of the biggest benefits of using a campaign like this is that it broadens my audience reach beyond what I could do on my own. </p>
<p>There are a lot of people you know that may not look for resources through crowd funding but who will benefit from this program. </p>
<p>If you can think of 1-3 people who would enjoy the benefits of early adoption there are two ways you can share this opportunity: <span><br/></span>1) If you’re at the computer you can simply use the Indiegogo share tools. They're at the top with social media options and quick embed and link options for emails. <span><br/></span>2) if you’re out and about you can tell people to search ""fail to win"" on the search bar here at Indiegogo. </p>

</div><p></p></div>","Short Summary“Fail and fail better.” 
“Fail forward”
“My success has been built one failure at a time”
We all hear the musings about failure and we agree that it’s sage advice. After all, mistakes are just part of our journey. But there hasn’t really been a roadmap that teaches people how to make the most of their bumps and bruises along the way. Until now!!
As an international speaker, writer, teacher and certified life coach I’ve accumulated and developed some the most practical tools around and helped people across the globe meet their personal and professional goals. I’ve taken the most effective and easiest to use methods I know and combined them into the life-transforming FAIL to Win (For All Is Love) program.  I've helped CEOs, Foreign Exchange traders, Trauma/Illness survivors and many more ditch their paralyzing, default beliefs and build happy, fruitful lives and businesses based on their authenticity and intrinsic personal values. 
                 This is more than motivation - this is practical application!

FAIL to Win is chock full of easy to learn, easy to execute tools and techniques that are specifically designed to slide right into your everyday life. Effecting real and lasting change in our lives takes time and practice and we’re more likely to use do what it takes when it is easy to add. 

That’s why FAIL to Win is so transformative. It takes all of those things we know we “should” be doing and makes them doable. The idea is to integrate small shifts in order to create lasting results. 

What I Need & What You Get
The bulk of the amount being raised will go to editing. I’ve already chosen the best contextual editor around to help me make the book cohesive and easy, easy, easy to use and implement. I’ve got a second editor that will do the nuts and bolts pieces - I’d love to avoid the mental equivalent of the fingernails on the chalkboard by keeping my grammar and punctuation sound.  Current Editing Estimate: $2500 - 3000

Additionally there is:

Graphic and Interior design ~$1500

I’ve budgeted for 250 books in the first round of printing ~$1000

Ebook conversion is a flat fee =$250

Estimated shipping ~$900

Printing 100 spiral bound workbooks ~$900

                          I want these tools in as many hands as possible!!
These perks are fun AND help you integrate the material for real and lasting change.
Contribution at any level includes 60 days FREE membership to my Lovely Members program. That includes, in part, free coaching, archived recordings, access to wonderful people building great things in their lives while you begin conditioning heart and mind to all that is possible just for being an early adopter of the book and program. 

Did you notice there are options that include powerful one on one coaching? 

Inevitably, others interact differently with us when we evolve and improve our lives. Often, they want what we're having. That's why I included levels specifically designed to include family, friends and communities into the process with additional materials meant for sharing. 

There are even options that include FAIL to Win Seminars for up to 50 people for people who are really serious about changing the direction of their organizations or management teams. (Workshops and Seminars need to either be within a 100 mile radius of Highlands Ranch or conducted via some virtual medium like Skype. Unless you're willing to pay travel expenses...then by all means...live and in-person it IS!)
I understand that this whole campaign could be it’s own anecdote for the next edition if I don’t meet my goal. Should that happen, the only thing that will change is the timeline. I will honor my promise to edit and print this book using my own personal funds as I can accommodate it which means it may take a little longer to pay for the bits and pieces. The benefits of the costs going straight to publishing and shipping expenses is that with fewer pre-purchases there is less of an investment in the first run and in mailing fees so I’m confident that it won’t be too much of a wait and I’ll stay in touch with you so you won’t be left hanging. 



The Impact
Imagine that person who is absolutely ready commit to finding the peace within that builds the best possible future yet is afraid to make the investment in themselves. Their first tentative step would be a book that they could readily afford and work on privately. 

The FAIL to Win Tele Course is currently priced to be highly accessible to people who are ready to create positive change in their lives. I understand, too, that there are people like I described who are ready for that transformation but to whom the course is still out of reach. 

When you contribute to this campaign you not only get all of the benefits of being an early adopter and all of the perks that come with your contribution you also become instrumental in giving someone a chance at a new, empowered beginning in all of their endeavors. You could be a hero!!
Risks & Challenges
Let’s get real. In every opportunity there is risk. While it is not in my business plan to jump into a ceiling fan and concuss myself into amnesia, my deathly fear of spiders means that scenario is not entirely off of the table. So let’s talk about what happens when…

We’ve already talked about what happens if the campaign is not fully funded

     … some of that risk is mitigated by the fact that publishing and printing expenses decrease as well 

     … making adjustments may push out the timeline a bit but I have great relationships with my team and have adjusted some other business expenditures to be able to set aside a bit of a safety net as well. 

     … this book WILL get published. 

I’m a perpetual learner and take advantage of continuing education opportunities. What happens if I learn new tools or make improvements to the program?

     … the book hasn’t been edited yet so there is always time to add or change material to improve the product before delivery,

     ... and if there's a way to bring you more - I will bring you more.
What if you hate the book?

     … it’s quite simple, I’ll refund your money. Seriously though...hate?? I'd be surprised.
What if it gets lost in the mail?

     … You and I will hold intent that it landed in the hands of the person who needed it most and I will send you another one.  

Other Ways You Can Help
I’m so glad you found FAIL to Win and are giving me the opportunity to be of service to you. 
I want these techniques readily available to anyone who is ready to change their story and their life and one of the biggest benefits of using a campaign like this is that it broadens my audience reach beyond what I could do on my own. 
There are a lot of people you know that may not look for resources through crowd funding but who will benefit from this program. 
If you can think of 1-3 people who would enjoy the benefits of early adoption there are two ways you can share this opportunity: 1) If you’re at the computer you can simply use the Indiegogo share tools. They're at the top with social media options and quick embed and link options for emails. 2) if you’re out and about you can tell people to search ""fail to win"" on the search bar here at Indiegogo.

<p>""Today, the effect of natural causes on the Dead Sea level is negligible, with the main changes caused by human interference. In Israel and the riparian entities, this interference increased with time: the Degania Dam across the Jordan River at the southern exit of the Sea of Galilee was heightened, other diversions and damming projects in the lake’s drainage basin were added, and pumping from the Dead Sea itself to industrial evaporation pools for the production of minerals, increased with the expansion of the pool areas, that now cover the entire southern basin, on both sides of the border.""</p>

</div><p dir=""LTR""> </p><p dir=""LTR""><strong>Q. Why an independent book?</strong></p><p dir=""LTR""><br/><strong>A. </strong>Independency means that the process is 100% in tune to what the book needs to convey without other considerations and limitations. A publication is a good way to bring together this journey linking major exhibitions, achievements, experiments, and projects. This book is not linked to one specific exhibition. We approached our colleagues, curators and writers, to relate and to elaborate on subjects and different aspects of this corpus of work. A book can collect together images and memories, bringing back experiences. It enables one to discover the impact of fifteen years of projects in a layered way - the way we envisioned this publication together with our editor David Goss and designer Michael Gordon.<br/>While collecting and going through the archives - we realized that some early works and installations were not documented well enough to be included in the book and were not available (some were thrown away in the deinstallation of exhibitions). We decided to redo the works which were missing. The last two years were devoted to making, reconstructing, and creating some new and some old salt sculptures. These salt works we then composed and installed in our studio near the Dead Sea.</p><p dir=""LTR""> </p><p dir=""LTR""><strong>Q. What is the Dead Sea for you?</strong></p><p dir=""LTR""> </p><p dir=""LTR""><strong>A. </strong>I know the sea and this area since I can remember myself. As a child I used to see it from the window of my home in Jerusalem. The years of working with the heavy liquid solution of the Dead Sea are connected not only to my personal and physical memories, but also to long gone memories of landscapes covered with snow and to a process of mourning; seeking to heal and to repair something through this dialogue with nature. Frozen, yet concieved by the desset sun and firy-waters, the sculptures are for me like personal archeological testimonies crystallized and immortalized. </p><div><p> </p></div><p dir=""LTR"" style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1516264084/nukcc90km7vqvpb69sfe.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p dir=""LTR"" style=""text-align: center;""><strong><a href=""http://www.sigalitlandau.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.sigalitlandau.com</a></strong></p><p dir=""LTR""> </p><p dir=""LTR""><strong>Press Materials:</strong></p><p dir=""LTR"">For high-res images, sample spreads, and a prospectus visit: <a href=""https://goo.gl/TQA3NM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://goo.gl/TQA3NM</a></p></div>","For Orders - Please visit Sigalitlandau.com  THE BOOKLandau invites us to embark on a journey facilitated by the unique feature of one natural resource, salt. Drawing inspiration from the topographical, historical, biblical, cultural, political and environmental realms of the Dead Sea, she turns to the natural process of salt crystallization, exclusive to the Dead Sea, for her unique artistic techne. Baptizing profane objects in its waters, Landau relies on the Dead Sea to breathe life into inanimate objects, which emerge from their submersion as if belonging to a different time system, a different logic, or another planet yet their transformation unveils the divine and the eternal in nature.Marking Landau's 15-year oeuvre and fascination with the Dead Sea, ‘Sigalit Landau: SALT YEARS’ sheds new light on the fundamental leitmotiv that underlies her multifaceted artistic creation. Offering insights to the artist's visions, this volume explores Landau's career reflecting the breadth of her oeuvre, including exclusive works of art created specifically for this book, behind the scenes photos, personal working notes and perceptive essays. It is an invitation to take part in the transformative power of art and Landau's transformation of the Dead Sea into a laboratory and medium for new experiments, ideas and heart/ground breaking understandings, revealing the death bearing to life sustaining alchemy of salt.   Book Details‘Sigalit Landau: SALT YEARS’ will be produced in 19 × 26 cm (7½ × 10¼ in.) format, with 400 pages, Weight: 1.3 kg (2.65 lb).

Dr. Eli Raz who is the leading expert geologist researching the causes for the current situation has written an updated report (not in academic jargon) for our book, in which he explains the circumstances and history of this disappearance and man-made catastrophe.Here is a film made with Dr. Raz explaining the phenomena of the sink holes and the situation at large : 
 
""Today, the effect of natural causes on the Dead Sea level is negligible, with the main changes caused by human interference. In Israel and the riparian entities, this interference increased with time: the Degania Dam across the Jordan River at the southern exit of the Sea of Galilee was heightened, other diversions and damming projects in the lake’s drainage basin were added, and pumping from the Dead Sea itself to industrial evaporation pools for the production of minerals, increased with the expansion of the pool areas, that now cover the entire southern basin, on both sides of the border.""
(Dr. Eli Raz, 'The life Story of the Dead Sea', from 'Sigalit Landau: SALT YEARS', 2018)
 Q. Why an independent book?A. Independency means that the process is 100% in tune to what the book needs to convey without other considerations and limitations. A publication is a good way to bring together this journey linking major exhibitions, achievements, experiments, and projects. This book is not linked to one specific exhibition. We approached our colleagues, curators and writers, to relate and to elaborate on subjects and different aspects of this corpus of work. A book can collect together images and memories, bringing back experiences. It enables one to discover the impact of fifteen years of projects in a layered way - the way we envisioned this publication together with our editor David Goss and designer Michael Gordon.While collecting and going through the archives - we realized that some early works and installations were not documented well enough to be included in the book and were not available (some were thrown away in the deinstallation of exhibitions). We decided to redo the works which were missing. The last two years were devoted to making, reconstructing, and creating some new and some old salt sculptures. These salt works we then composed and installed in our studio near the Dead Sea. Q. What is the Dead Sea for you? A. I know the sea and this area since I can remember myself. As a child I used to see it from the window of my home in Jerusalem. The years of working with the heavy liquid solution of the Dead Sea are connected not only to my personal and physical memories, but also to long gone memories of landscapes covered with snow and to a process of mourning; seeking to heal and to repair something through this dialogue with nature. Frozen, yet concieved by the desset sun and firy-waters, the sculptures are for me like personal archeological testimonies crystallized and immortalized.  www.sigalitlandau.com Press Materials:For high-res images, sample spreads, and a prospectus visit: https://goo.gl/TQA3NM",17.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi. I'm Brooks Palmer and I'm raising funds to cover the completion of my humor and cartoon book, Better Late Than Dead! I'm a humorist, writer, artist, and musician. Better Late Than Dead! is a compilation of some of my best humorous short stories, words of wisdom, and cartoons. I wrote and drew these pieces to make people laugh and think. It's my way of making the world a more fun and kind place to be. By contributing to my campaign, you can help me help the world to laugh and enjoy itself.</p>
<p>The book has endorsements from multiple comedy writers, including David Walbridge, President of Pro Comedy Writing, who said,</p>
<p>“Better Late than Dead is either a stand-up comedy routine or a book of Zen koans or a series of fortune cookies written by a hipster; either way it's funny and delightful. Mr. Palmer's books have been translated into 13 languages, but this one won't make a lick of sense in Swahili. It’s the perfect book to give as a gift, especially for humans, and is conveniently lunch-box portable (unlike say, a surfboard).”</p>
<p>Through this campaign I'm raising $780 to pay for the formatting of the inside and outside of the book. The formatting will be done by Colleen Sheehan at Write Dream Repeat You can find her at <a href=""http://www.wdrbookdesign.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.wdrbookdesign.com/</a>. Better Late Than Dead! has been fully compiled and edited. Now it just needs the formatting for it to be out in the world. I'll be self-publishing and selling the book through Amazon where people will be able to buy a Kindle or paperback version.</p>
<p>I want to give back to you for giving to me. If you donate $35 to my campaign, I will send you a signed paperback version of Better Late Than Dead! If you donate $50, I will send you a signed paperback version of Better Late Than Dead! that will include a personally hand drawn cartoon especially for you. If you donate $150, I will send you a signed paperback version of Better Late Than Dead! with a personally hand drawn cartoon especially for you, as well as an unframed 11""x14"" pastel drawing created with you in mind.</p>
<p>The world needs more kind humor. With your contribution, you'll help make people's hearts laugh. Laughter connects us rather than divides us. My two previous books, Clutter Busting: Letting Go of What's Holding You Back, and Clutter Busting Your Life: Clearing Physical and Emotional Clutter to Reconnect with Yourself and Others, were books about how to let go of what's no longer serving you so you can enjoy your life. Those books were bestsellers that have been translated into eight languages. My hopes are that Better Late Than Dead! will also speak to a great many people, and help open their hearts with humor.</p>
<p>Once Better Late Than Dead! is for sale to the public, I will heavily promote it. I will use some of the same channels that were used to promote my two previous books. I'm a personable salesperson. I have a way of talking about things that gets people interested. I will also be asking fans of my previous work to help spread the word. I can also use your help in getting the word out about Better Late Than Dead! Your help means a lot to me.</p>
<p>If you can't contribute financially, I would ask if you can help others know about this campaign and the book. You word is powerful. I'm deeply grateful if you choose to support Better Late Than Dead! Indiegogo has share tools that make spreading the word easier. Thanks!</p>
<p>If I raise more than $780, I will put the money towards the marketing of Better Late Than Dead!</p>
<p>Here's a sample from Better Late Than Dead!:</p>
<p>""A guy is digging a hole in his backyard and gets about three feet into the ground and hits something. He can’t tell what it is, so he digs it up and puts it on the ground above him so he can take a look at it.</p>
<p>He gets out and sees it is a tombstone and his name is written on it.</p>
<p>Due to shock from seeing this, plus exhaustion from digging all day, he passes out, falls into the hole, the dirt caves in on him and he dies.</p>
<p>Sometimes, things work out.""</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>In late 2008, I began a piece about skin color and <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">how women, see ourselves, in light of our histories of colonization and racism, the media and cosmetic industry.  </span>I had been curious about why, both in the United States, and in the Philippines, women would want to change the way we look, and I wanted to know what events might have led to this self-perception.</p>
<br style=""font-weight: bold;""/><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">And so I began writing.  </span>With dancer Frances Sedayao, I crafted a small piece focusing on whitening cosmetics that we showed at CounterPULSE in San Francisco.  I delved into research on Filipino history around the turn of the 20th century, conducted interviews with women of color of various ages about their skin color, talked with bright minds, and wrote, wrote, wrote. I began working with Aimee Espiritu, who brought both her scholarship as well as her visual artist's eye to develop projections to pair with the script. I crafted characters including a Fil-Am undergoing whitening treatments, a woman on display at the the 1904 World's Fair, and the ghost of a woman victim of femicide, commenting on the ways women's bodies have been fragmented and exploited.  Actual interview subjects performed on stage, giving testimony to common experiences of feeling ostracized or judged because of darker skin tones.<br/><br/>Kularts, Inc. hosted us in a Fall residency within which we gave two arts workshops, and participants were so enthusiastic that several of them joined our cast and crew!  We showed two nights of work-in-progress performance at the Bayanihan Center, and had a lively talkback session with the audiences. <span style=""font-weight: bold;""> Tears were shed, hearts were opened, and we all learned a great deal about one another.

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>This is a very short-term, relatively small campaign and so we need to operate with a swiftness. Please pass it on to your friends to make a quick donation!  Think of the 2 $4.50 soy mochas or the 1 movie or dinner you can forgo once to help me put this art into the world.  You can also join the circle of supporters of A History of the Body: several people are throwing small house parties to raise funds for the production of the play (costs will be over $20,000).  You can also volunteer to be an interview subject, help with research, join the production team, or sign up for a writing workshop when it's next offered.<br/><br/>

Hello! Irvin here. I am a fashion and portrait photographer (www.graphicsmetropolis.com) and I started A BOOK OF (www.abookof.us) a few years ago with the goal to make a collection of photos and stories with the topics and ideas that I love. It is an ambitious attempt to create a publication that can provide a venue to share stories with creative freedom. In doing so, I also thought of my creative friends and colleagues in mind. What if I create something that can not only share stories but also make a proactive impact that goes beyond the pages of the magazine?
When I first conceived A BOOK OF, I remember writing on the subway ride home how I envision each issue to support a charity or a cause. In that way, you as the reader also participate in the process.
A BOOK OF's title exists to place whatever story we are telling to the forefront. In our publication, Story rules. Whatever the method and the medium, our mission is to share the best stories to our audience.
A BOOK OF can be a book of anything. The possibilities are endless!

WHAT WE NEED
The contents and the shoots are all done and ready. We just need a little help in the $$ department to print the issue, distribute it, and set-up a launch event. Any help would go a long way. You can help us by sharing this to your social media friends and help us spread the word. You can also help by donating whatever you can.
WHY CONTRIBUTE
Because you love the arts and you want to support your fellow artists. Because you believe that print is alive. Because you know that there is power in storytelling. Because you will help us create and curate more stories for you.
You will help us print the book, distribute it to a larger audience, and YOU are going to be a part of it.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>Have you ever been told to “suck it up!”? Have you ever said to yourself, “My voice isn’t worth it. I’m crazy!”?<br/>You’re going to mess up. The person sitting next to you will, too. Let’s talk about it.<br/><br/>We all make mistakes. We all experience immense shame and guilt. And we all use our voices to spread a message. In VulnerABLE: How to Notice the Power of Vulnerability through Lettuce, Laundry, and Love, you'll notice the power in one's voice, and how to recognize what you were meant to share with the world. By exploring the meaning of vulnerability versus oversharing, and the importance of understanding ourselves and each other, we will look at lettuce, laundry, and love in a different way. We will explore the true meaning of connection.<br/><br/>My name is Julia Ruggiero and I am the author of VulnerABLE. I wrote this book because I never wanted anyone to feel stuck or alone for being themselves. I did not want to see any more people changing just to please others, and losing a grasp on what they truly love. I see the power in other people's voices, and want to help everyone and anyone feel like they do not need to withhold what they are meant to share with the world.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the meaning behind vulnerability in a relatable and unique manner. I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for your voice in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you to embrace the imperfect and encourage others to love themselves and one another.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn how to notice vulnerability and gain the confidence in knowing you are not alone through three parts:<ul>
<li>How our own voices and thoughts hold us back from embracing our worth</li>
<li>How other's voices, criticism, and opinions influence how we look at ourselves</li>
<li>How to notice the bigger, realistic meaning of love and connection</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you ever experience doubt, sadness, confusion, or loneliness; people who are in a transition period in their lives whether a student, graduate, new parent, or someone who thinks they need to be somebody they are not to succeed. Notice how people can feel confident to use their voices, but also listen and accept other's voices. Realize that everyone is going through small and large changes in their lives, and we all handle stressors differently. VulnerABLE: How to Notice the Power of Vulnerability through Lettuce, Laundry, and Love, is a non-fiction book that speaks to people going through a time of transition looking to reframe their mindset, and notice the power in their voices.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The Book -<i> VulnerABLE: How to Notice the Power of Vulnerability through Lettuce, Laundry, and Love</i>
</h2>
<p>The book is written in three parts: Lettuce, Laundry, and Love. In Part 1, Lettuce, the chapter titles are the words we say to ourselves that hinder us from embracing vulnerability. Whether through doubt or self deprecation, we need to notice the harmful statements that hinder us from accepting ourselves. Hear from Julia, other women of all ages, and men discuss mental health barriers and the way we tend to view ourselves in times of stress.<br/><br/>In Part 2, Laundry, the chapter titles are quotes other people say to us that influence how we use our voices. Too many people give up knowing that we cannot control what others say to us, or the things that happen to us. Part 2 helps us navigate through situations that feel insurmountable, and learn how to accept and reason with others.<br/><br/>In Part 3, Love, the chapter titles focus on how we can work together to realize the realistic meaning of love, commitment, and connection. Julia speaks from personal experience about romantic and family relationships, doubts, and creating a safe space for vulnerability.</p>

</div></div>","Story of My BookHave you ever been told to “suck it up!”? Have you ever said to yourself, “My voice isn’t worth it. I’m crazy!”?You’re going to mess up. The person sitting next to you will, too. Let’s talk about it.We all make mistakes. We all experience immense shame and guilt. And we all use our voices to spread a message. In VulnerABLE: How to Notice the Power of Vulnerability through Lettuce, Laundry, and Love, you'll notice the power in one's voice, and how to recognize what you were meant to share with the world. By exploring the meaning of vulnerability versus oversharing, and the importance of understanding ourselves and each other, we will look at lettuce, laundry, and love in a different way. We will explore the true meaning of connection.My name is Julia Ruggiero and I am the author of VulnerABLE. I wrote this book because I never wanted anyone to feel stuck or alone for being themselves. I did not want to see any more people changing just to please others, and losing a grasp on what they truly love. I see the power in other people's voices, and want to help everyone and anyone feel like they do not need to withhold what they are meant to share with the world.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the meaning behind vulnerability in a relatable and unique manner. I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for your voice in you. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you to embrace the imperfect and encourage others to love themselves and one another.In this book, you'll learn how to notice vulnerability and gain the confidence in knowing you are not alone through three parts:
How our own voices and thoughts hold us back from embracing our worth
How other's voices, criticism, and opinions influence how we look at ourselves
How to notice the bigger, realistic meaning of love and connection

You will love this book if you ever experience doubt, sadness, confusion, or loneliness; people who are in a transition period in their lives whether a student, graduate, new parent, or someone who thinks they need to be somebody they are not to succeed. Notice how people can feel confident to use their voices, but also listen and accept other's voices. Realize that everyone is going through small and large changes in their lives, and we all handle stressors differently. VulnerABLE: How to Notice the Power of Vulnerability through Lettuce, Laundry, and Love, is a non-fiction book that speaks to people going through a time of transition looking to reframe their mindset, and notice the power in their voices.
 
The Book - VulnerABLE: How to Notice the Power of Vulnerability through Lettuce, Laundry, and Love

The book is written in three parts: Lettuce, Laundry, and Love. In Part 1, Lettuce, the chapter titles are the words we say to ourselves that hinder us from embracing vulnerability. Whether through doubt or self deprecation, we need to notice the harmful statements that hinder us from accepting ourselves. Hear from Julia, other women of all ages, and men discuss mental health barriers and the way we tend to view ourselves in times of stress.In Part 2, Laundry, the chapter titles are quotes other people say to us that influence how we use our voices. Too many people give up knowing that we cannot control what others say to us, or the things that happen to us. Part 2 helps us navigate through situations that feel insurmountable, and learn how to accept and reason with others.In Part 3, Love, the chapter titles focus on how we can work together to realize the realistic meaning of love, commitment, and connection. Julia speaks from personal experience about romantic and family relationships, doubts, and creating a safe space for vulnerability.

As some of you may know, I resisted creative writing for a long time and I'm finally giving into my passion. Publishing this collection is both vulnerable and exciting for me. I'm proud to say a number of the included pieces have been edited in their early stages by recent Nobel Prize winner Louise Glück and honored that a piece in the collection will also appear this summer in The Threepenny Review (where Louise often chooses to publish her own work). <br/><br/><strong>ABOUT THE AUTHOR:</strong><br/>Julia is a senior at Yale studying Film and Media with a focus on screenwriting and a developed interest in poetry. <br/>She was born and raised in various parts of Southern California and is currently very cold in her New Haven apartment.<br/>For more information you can email her at julia.leatham@yale.edu. <br/>Or, you can follow her on Instagram at @juliamorgan_writer. <br/>To read some past essays, check out Julia Leatham in the Yale Daily News.<br/><br/><strong>PERKS OF PRE-ORDERING:</strong><br/>* You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish.<br/>*Packaging designed by yours truly.<br/>* Your name will appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book. <br/>* You will receive early access to the Author’s Note and other excerpts from my book, with the opportunity to review these sections and give me feedback if you wish to do so!<br/>* You will have the opportunity to be involved in selecting my cover. <br/>* You will be invited to join my Author Community and get behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into the publishing process.<br/>* I will write you a personalized note! <br/><br/><strong>WHY I NEED YOU:</strong><br/>This book will be published with New Degree Press, which is a hybrid publisher.

The book aims to make bodily awareness more accessible using a mix of storytelling and humor.<br/><br/>My name is Miriam Prosnitz, and I am the author of <i>Period? Life with Menstruation</i>. I wrote this book because menstruation is an uncomfortable topic for many and talking about periods gives us better tools to understand and manage our own bodies.<br/><br/>Rather than follow the status quo and pretend menstruation doesn't exist, I decided to write a book sharing the awkward, funny, and bloody moments of being a woman with a period. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that while every woman has a unique relationship with her body, and periods aren't scary. You can even laugh about them. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to learn about menstruation, understand the impact menstruation has on people’s lives, and acknowledge the importance of bodily education.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll encounter multifaceted dimensions of the human female and her not-so-mystical vagina through narratives about:</p><ul>
<li>Buying a pregnancy test at Target while praying not to be recognized.</li>
<li>What really happens when a tampon is flushed down the toilet.</li>
<li>Trying a menstrual cup for the first time with vigor.</li>
</ul><p> </p><p>Get the idea? There are 15 stories in this book, and they are all WILD while also being honest and relatable.

Life with Menstruation </i>speaks to women and open-minded men who want to grapple with how women and society treat menstruation.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Period?

<li>Why does birth control suck?</li>
<li>What is a menstrual disc and why did school teach me more about the British Monarchy than about period products? Henry VIII is never relevant, and I get my period every 30ish days.</li>
<li>Why is there so much stigma around menstruation? Pad commercials used viscous blue fluid to show “blood” until literally 2020 when they switched the color to red (any other year and that would have trended on twitter)</li>

<p><strong>Story of My Book</strong></p>
<p>My name is Tiffany Mosher and I am the author of <i>Beauty Beyond the Threshold</i>. I feel that my book offers readers a different perspective on how powerful the act of stepping out of their comfort zone truly can be in helping regain confidence and happiness within. As an introvert and someone who is naturally very shy, traveling solo was so frightening yet incredibly freeing at the same time. Overcoming depression and building confidence can be achieved by taking a step across the threshold, or, in other words stepping out of the comfort zone, and doing something a little terrifying yet a little exciting. For me personally, this meant traveling to volunteer in disaster response and school restoration projects. For others, those comfort zones can be something completely different. An example of this would be an aspiring singer who wants to get their name out there can take that step and sign up to sing at an open mic night. Every person knows what their individual thresholds are, and when we identify those and push ourselves to do something that can bring us happiness and joy, despite it being a little bit scary, there is so much beauty that can be discovered.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, readers will be inspired to take healthy risks for the sake of learning more about themselves and bettering themselves. For those who are feeling sad, depressed, and anxious, don’t give up or lose hope. There is so much beauty beyond the threshold and all it takes to discover it is taking that first step.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you are someone who enjoys reading success stories of people who were able to overcome obstacles in unique ways, someone who enjoys reading about travel experiences, or someone who wants to get more out of their travel experiences. Beauty Beyond the Threshold speaks to readers who are seeking an alternative way to battle depression or anxiety or to readers who simply want to gain confidence and self-esteem. Reading my story can help you find inspiration and motivation to want to try something new.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Beauty Beyond the Threshold</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is my “threshold”? What is holding me back?</li>
<li>Some of the coping skills I tried in order to alleviate my depression and anxiety aren’t working. How can I help break the cycle of depression and anxiety within myself?</li>
<li>What are some new things I can experience that will help me build my confidence and self-esteem?</li>
<li>In what ways can I help and encourage someone who is battling depression and anxiety?</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. Coming together and discussing the intersection of depression and recovery and the importance of building confidence and self-esteem will change us all for the better.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Book - Beauty Beyond the Threshold</strong></p>Part 1 contains the Prologue and Chapters 1-5. In these chapters, I share the background of the circumstances that led to my severe depression and anxiety which led me to the brink of suicide. Suddenly faced with being a single mom in my early 20s with two young children, I developed an immense fear of abandonment that sent my mind into a downward spiral of paranoia, anxiety, and depression. You will read about the difficult emotions I experienced and about the various coping skills that I used (which ultimately didn’t work out in my favor).<br/><br/>Part 2 contains Chapters 6-11. In these chapters, you will read about how I started my path of recovery. You will see how I became empowered and inspired after I made a spontaneous decision to travel by myself to the small town of Barranquitas, Puerto Rico to volunteer in disaster response after Hurricane Maria. Having never done any sort of construction work prior to going to Puerto Rico, it was amazing how helping completing a concrete roof repair for a gentleman named Israel changed my life for the better. You will also read some other fun and inspiring stories that involve me pushing myself out of my comfort zone all while dealing with new experiences of pain and heartache, like my amusing first attempt at acting while volunteering with the local emergency response team and my wild adventure of traveling solo to the jungle of Mexico (in other words, the trip where everything went wrong!).<br/><br/>Part 3 contains Chapters 12-19. In these chapters, you will read about my fun and wild adventures traveling all the way across the world to Nepal where I volunteered in earthquake relief and helped build two schools. I was literally terrified to travel all that way by myself. However, Nepal was on my bucket list! I was determined to go, so I took the risk and went. The different types of work I helped with like mixing cement, making bricks, and backfilling dirt all took a physical toll on my body that was already exhausted from the jet lag. However, the most beautiful thing was seeing the hope and gratitude in the eyes of the Nepali children who would be attending the schools after they were completed. Knowing that I was going to be making a difference in those children’s lives and for generations to come was a priceless gift for my mind, body, and soul.<p> </p>

<p>Tiffany Mosher is an author and Logistics Analyst in Norfolk, Virginia. She graduated from the University of Maryland with a Bachelor of Science in Social Science with concentrations in Anthropology and Sociology. As a current graduate student studying Human Security and Resilience at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, her research emphasis is focused on human and ecosystem resilience as well as resource insecurities within ethnic minorities and indigenous societies amid natural disasters, intra- and international conflicts, and mass migration. She will be graduating this October.<br/><br/>Tiffany has found solace in the numerous volunteer opportunities that she has participated in. She is the International Missions Director for AIDNOW, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization based in Virginia Beach, Virginia whose mission is to bring education, health, sanitation, and physical resources together to assist individuals in South Eastern Virginia, Nationally, and Globally. AIDNOW’s Jump Start project is an annual event that is held for approximately 500 students in the Virginia Beach City Public Schools System identified as homeless and marginalized to receive much-needed supplies and services, such as backpacks, school supplies, clothing, haircuts, eye exams, toiletries and shelf-stable food. Project Fostering Hope is a partnership between AIDNOW and Dreams for Mayan Children that focuses on the restoration of the grounds of the Francisco Gonzalez Baconegra Preescolar in the indigenous Mayan village of Nuevo Durango, Quintana-Roo, Mexico. The mission of Fostering Hope is to build resilience in the children of the village by creating a fun and safe learning environment.<br/><br/>As a disaster response volunteer with All Hands and Hearts, Tiffany participated in concrete roof repair and mold sanitation in Barranquitas, Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria, mucking, gutting, and critical home repairs in Bayboro, North Carolina after Hurricane Florence, and assisted in earthquake recovery for the rebuild of two schools (Thakureshwor and Janakalyan) in Marin, Nepal. She has also volunteered with Positive Legacy and Dreams for Mayan Children in Dos Palmas and Chemuyil, Mexico, and with the Community Emergency Response Team in Chesapeake, Virginia.<br/><br/>When Tiffany isn’t working, studying, or writing, she enjoys spending time with her family. She is an avid learner and is interested in researching different cultures around the world and loves going to museums. Her guilty pleasures include reading travelogues, drinking hot tea (even if it is 95 degrees outside), listening to the Avett Brothers, going to concerts (especially to see the Avett Brothers), playing the guitar and piano, and watching Jeopardy! and marathons of the Golden Girls. If you happen to be sitting with Tiffany while she has a margarita in hand, you never know what silly directions the conversation will go in!<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Tiffany at tmosher.author@gmail.com, on Facebook @TiffanyMosherAuthor, on Instagram @author_tiffany_mosher and LinkedIn linkedin.com/in/tiffany-mosher-11534b117.</p>

<h3>The Campaign</h3>
<p>Our dear friend Kristin recently found out that she has breast cancer. We started this campaign to make sure Kristin can keep doing everything she loves. Eat yummy food. Practice yoga. Read lots of books. Have her friends and family by her side. She has the best of the best doctors to take care of her body, we can all help take care of her soul. Keep Kristin Comfy. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>We need to raise money to buy things for Kristin that will make her smile. You choose what you want to donate, we will go out and purchase, and together we'll all present the gifts you've generously donated to Kristin at a party in her honor. If you'd rather just donate money, we'll keep a running list of all of the donors as well. When it prompts you to enter your address after donating please do, so we can send you a thank you letter after the party. Details on the party TBA.</p>
</div>
<div>

</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We've designed the campaign keeping in mind that some of you might not have much money to contribute. You can donate one of the $25 gifts or even $5 in cash. Also, if you want to join together with a few people and pool your money to put it towards something more expensive, like a flight for Kristin's parents to come visit, that's another option. Anything you can do will help. And, of course, we hope you'll all make it to Kristin's party. </p>

<p>“You don't know what it’s like to care. Every day is exhausting and horrifying, because no one else feels to such an extent. They don't comprehend it. You don't get their oblivious, mindless, unconscious trek to wherever they're told to go, and they don't get you. Its enraging not to be able to communicate with them. You feel like you want to just lose yourself and fall into that sea of apathy, but you also want to remain a man and individual. Sensitivity is a gift above all. It gives life spark and meaning. But surrounded by those who feel nothing, it becomes hell. One seemingly insignificant and arbitrary thing can set you off. It breaks your heart and then you obsess on it. You have to fix it. And everyone thinks you're crazy to have something this odd affect you this much, but you know exactly why, you can feel it, but you can't quite put it into words. It’s beyond that. All you know how to say is, its empathy and love. I want you. I want to make sure you're okay, and that you always will be. People treat death like a status or a number. And in questing for power for whatever reason, it becomes a minor set-back, you mourn and keep going. People comfort themselves by saying they've moved on and they're in a better place. Like their suffering is over. You forget that life is the heaven we've been looking and waiting for. And we waste it by fighting and killing, trying to get to it. It’s here, now. Just covered by everything we've filled it with. Everything's so rushed and mechanic. Inhuman. Ambition will come naturally if we just leave everyone alone. And right now contentment is the most sought after and impossible want to obtain. There's something very wrong with that. We're all constantly working to stay alive until the day we die. That's not natural, that's just the corner we've forced ourselves into. And with all we've discovered and all we've created up until now, fighting to live everyday of our lives, is the last position we should be in.”</p>

And right now contentment is the most sought after and impossible want to obtain. There's something very wrong with that. We're all constantly working to stay alive until the day we die. That's not natural, that's just the corner we've forced ourselves into. And with all we've discovered and all we've created up until now, fighting to live everyday of our lives, is the last position we should be in.”
If you can or cannot pay, either way, please get the word out. The novel is important to me, and I hope you connect with the excerpt , and agree that it can make an impact, if read.

The Story
I moved to Colombia and fell in love with a beautiful country and the friendliness and openness of the Colombia people. 
After eight months of research and writing I was able to produce a travel guide of many regions of Colombia, but I fell short of producing a book on the whole country and had to leave the country due to a lack of finances.
Many people in Colombia and around my life ask me similar questions all the time:
What happened during this eight month period?
Why did I walk away from the project?
Why would a teacher quit his secure job and try to publish books with no experience as a writer or in the book industry?
Why did I choose Colombia to be the first country that I created a book on?
What would possess me to ride a motorcycle around one of the world's most perceived dangerous countries?
Where did I go too and why am I back in Colombia with a new blog and my first book back on the market?

<p>Twenty-six years ago a man took his daughter through the forest with thirteen containers of ashes and bone to sprinkle into the creek, making a child the only accomplice to scores of unsolved disappearances. Homicide detective Simone Rocher can’t even recall the last time she thought about her childhood, much less cared.

Thanks for your interest in the SHE (Strength Hope Encouragement) for women We are Real writing project. <em>The basis of this project is to build an anthology of women’s personal stories</em>. If done correctly it will help us to discover that as women we share more similarities than we do differences, and second it will provide support for each of us as we continue on our journeys towards personal empowerment and personal sustainability. <strong>That is why we need your help.</strong></p>
<p> This is how it works; each young woman will write a story on one of the following topics:</p>
<p>                 (a) AN EVENT THAT HAS OCCURRED IN YOUR LIFE THAT HELPED YOU GROW</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                 (b) AN EVENT THAT HAS OCCURRED IN YOUR LIFE THAT CAN INSPIRE OR MOTIVATE ANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN</p>
<p> </p>
<p>                (c) AN EVENT THAT DEMONSTRATES HOW YOU CONTRIBUTE TO WOMEN’S EMPOWERMENT</p>
<p>Afterward, I will edit the anthology and divide it into specifc catagories such as ""Women and Money,"" or ""Women and Detemination."" You get the idea. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need two very important things that will make SHE a reality. We need marketing and we need support to publish the anthology,</p>
<p>In order for the project to work it needs to reach more women. <em><strong>Your contribution will help us do just that</strong></em>. We also need funds to promote the anthology once it is complete. YOUR CONTIBUTION WILL BE BROKEN DOWN LIKE SO:</p>
<p><strong><em>%25 of the funds used to advertise for submissions for SHE</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>%50 of the funds used for the creation of the antology (paying cover artist, printers,copyer,etc)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>%25 used to return perks for your support </em></strong></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The difference your contribution will make:</p>
<p>This endeavor cannot be achieved alone. With your contribution SHE will reach more women and therefore impact more lives. <strong>The anthology will include the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A letter to our daughters (from an elder of our choosing)</li>
<li>Universal topics that impact young women (love, money, sex, career, body image, family, self-esteem)</li>
<li>A letter from the editor</li>

<p><strong>WHY DO I WANT TO PRESS A 7"" RECORD: </strong></p>
<p>I'm proceeding this art project of recording and pressing these four poems because I've always wanted to release something in my favorite musical format, vinyl. But I want to do it differently. I've collected records for years and what I come to love about them is that they feel like the next best thing to seeing the band live. I'm trying to recreate that effect, but with my Spoken Word.</p>
<p>I've always approached ""Trey the Ruler"" as if it were a band, being on tour for months at a time, printing merch, and now soon; releasing records. This is all rooted from my upbringing in the music scene, later to be my love for the hardcore/punk scene where I learned my DIY ethic approach when it comes to what I do. That's why I perform at shows without other spoken word artists, that's why I tour with bands. Because that's what I love and what I write applies very deeply to people like me who are found in the hardcore scene. </p>
<p>I plan on still sticking to those DIY ethics, even if with your finachal investment and involvement. For instance I plan on ordering the records, jackets, and bags all from different distributors (thanks to my friend Cassidy from Better Days Records) to keep it affordable. I'll be assembling all records by hand.  Mailing/selling/distro will all be done by me. I still control all the orders, and connections to find tours. It's all still me. </p>
<p><strong>By doing this I am by no way saying that you need money to do Spoken Word, because you don't. You need only your own voice</strong>. This fundraiser is me saying I'd like to take my Spoken Word to the next level, by becoming a part of your record collection. Neighboring all those other records by bands that I look up to. This gives me a chance to do it in a timely manner to release these pieces where they are still very relevant to me and world we live in. </p>
<p>If you donate to help me make this finally happen, thank you so much. If you took the time to read this, thank you as well. I'd love to make this happen but only can if people get involved with an understanding that they can be a part of something that can change the way people think about recording Spoken Word. <strong>If the goal is exceeded, every dollar will go to the kick off for this record and making it a worthy celebration where the record will be affordable</strong>. So please share this page with your friends and family. The first poem of this record is titled ""<em>Deth Cvlt</em>"" and you can check that out on this page.</p>

<h2>SUMMARY OF THE <em>GLOBAL SENSE</em> PROPOSAL</h2>
<hr/>
<p><img alt=""Global Sense by Judah Freed"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://media-visions.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/GlobalSense-Cover-15jan12-200x300.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; float: left;"" title=""Global Sense by Judah Freed""/></p>
<p><em>GLOBAL SENSE</em> reveals the way the world really works and how a sense of our global oneness empowers us to change the world from within ourselves.</p>
<p>Uniting inner spirituality and personal growth with ecological awareness and grassroots politics, <em>Global Sense</em> brings our highest ideals down to earth where we can use them. Inspired by Thomas Paine’s history-changing 1776 essay, <em>Common Sense</em>, <em>Global Sense: The 2012 Edition</em> offers reasons for hope in these times that try our souls.</p>
<p>If you support robust marketing, printing and international distribution of my award-winning book, <em>Global Sense</em>: <em>The 2012 Edition</em>, you can help to awaken people worldwide. (Please visit the book website at <a href=""http://globalsense.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">GlobalSense.com</a>)</p>
<p>Please see the growing list of contributors with links their websites posted at <a href=""http://globalsense.com/community/crowdfunders/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">GlobalSense.com/community/crowdfunders</a><em><a href=""http://globalsense.com/community/crowdfunders/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">/</a><br/></em></p>
<h3><strong>About the Book</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong></strong><em>Global Sense</em> explains and promotes the power of our global interactivity to transform the world through our individual actions (this very same connectivity empowers crowdfunding). <em>Global Sense</em> aims to help society reach the pivotal ""tipping point"" before it's too late.<br/>  </li>
<li>Uniting spiritual enlightenment and personal growth with global thinking and grassroots politics, <em>Global Sense</em> brings our highest ideals down to earth where we can use them.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Audience for the Book<br/><em></em>
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Multiple research sources show that a core group about 15 percent of all adults in the world's industrialized nations have developed a global sensibility. This percentage is slightly lower in the so-called ""third world"" countries.<br/>  </li>
<li>Given 4.9 billion adults among 7 billion people on the planet, that 15 percent equals <em>at least 500 million people with global sense on earth today. </em>Growing this base of global thinkers can transform society and help us resolve our global crises together.<em><br/>   <br/></em><em> </em>
</li>
<li>If one percent (1 percent) of the 500 million audience reads <em>Global Sense,</em> this would mean 5 million copies of the book influencing individuals and society as a whole, speeding up the day when we create a sustainable future.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Why crowdfunding is needed</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<img alt=""Books"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://globalsense.com/images/stack_of_books-200x133-publicdomain.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: right; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"" title=""The more books I can affrod to print in advance, the better my chances of securing international book distribution.""/>I am currently printing <em>Global Sense</em> for online sales of a trade paperback edition through digital print-on-demand presses in the U.S., UK and (soon) Australia. This involves little up-front capital on my end, however....<br/>   </li>
<li>Physical bookstores and libraries almost never order print-on-demand books. They want hardcover (cloth cover) books, which requires traditional advance printing, This severely limits the potential reach of <em>Global Sense</em> and its benefits.<br/>  </li>
<li>The solution is printing clothcover books in advance, so one or more of the top book distributors will agree to carry and promote the book to stores and libraries around the world, or at least in the English-reading nations.<br/>  </li>
<li>Conventional cothcover book printing can be pricey. The cost-per copy hinges on the amount of copies printed once the presses are running. The more books that I can afford to print at once, the lower the unit cost for these books.<br/>  </li>
<li>Strong support for this crowdfunding campaign is essential for persuading one or more top distributors to carry <em>Global Sense, </em>since they will see the book has a strong market base.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How your contribution will be used</h3>
<ul>
<li>Your contribution will support printing clothcover editions of <em>Global Sense</em> after securing trade distribution to retail chains, independent booksellers, libraries, colleges, and universities throughout the English-reading world.<br/>   </li>
<li>Reaching the full $22,000 goal will allow the printing and distribution of clothcover books throughout English-reading nations. Lesser funding will support printing and distribution at a proportional level.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>If total funding is below $5,000, since that will not be enough for advance printing of a hardbound edition, your contribution instead will go toward the marketing the POD edition, so I can earn enough though online sales to print the clothcover edition.</li>
</ul>
<h3>My qualifications to do what I propose</h3>
<ul>
<li>I was trained in book marketing and publicity by the same people who trained Deepak Chopra, Jack Canfield, Mark Victor Hansen, John Gray, Robert Kiyosaki, and other best-selling authors who started as unknowns. <br/><br/>
</li>
<li>Along with 30 years of professional experience as a local to global journalist, I've managed marketing, public relations and advertising campaigns for major organizations and cultural institutions. I'm already applying this skill toward marketing <em>Global Sense</em> assertively.<br/><br/>
</li>
<li>My extensive book industry knowledge flows from membership and leadership in such trade organizations as the Independent Book Publisher Association (IBPA), American Society of Journalists and Authors, Colorado Independent Publishers Association, Colorado Authors League, and Denver Press Club. I founded the 900-member Denver Book Club. Also, I serve diverse clients as a book publishing coach through my own Hoku House in Hawaii.<br/>  </li>

<h2>THE FULL PROPOSAL FOR <em>GLOBAL SENSE:</em>
</h2>
<hr/>
<p><img alt=""Global Sense by Judah Freed"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://media-visions.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/GlobalSense-Cover-15jan12-200x300.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; float: left;"" title=""Global Sense by Judah Freed""/>Please consider supporting international printing and distribution for the new 2012 edition of my award-winning book, <em><strong><a href=""http://globalsense.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Global Sense website"">GLOBAL SENSE: A spiritual handbook on the nature of society and how to change the world by changing ourselves</a></strong></em>.<em></em></p>
<p><em>Global Sense </em>explains and promotes the power of our global interactivity to transform the world through our individual actions -- the exact same power of connectivity that fuels global crowdfunding on Indiegogo. <br/><br/><em>Global Sense</em> won the 2012 Silver Nautilus Award for Best Social Change Book. Previous editions have won awards for best social change book and best personal growth book along with being featured on C-SPAN Book TV (USA). The revised edition is a full rewrite and expansion with a major focus on practical tools and tips that readers can apply in real life.</p>
<p>Uniting spiritual enlightenment and personal growth with global thinking and grassroots politics, <em>Global Sense</em> brings our highest ideals down to earth where we can use them.</p>
<p><img alt=""Nautilus Award"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://globalsense.com/images/nautilusaward.jpg"" src="""" style=""margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px; float: right;"" title=""Global Sense won the 2012 Silver Nautilus Award""/>Inspired by Thomas Paine's history-changing 1776 essay, <em>Common Sense, </em>the 2012 edition of<em> Global Sense</em> offers reasons for hope in these dark times that try our souls. We truly can build our world anew in the 21st century.</p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">At the heart of the book is an historical investigation into the causes of today's global environmental and economic crises, which I identify as ""alpha male rule"" and ""authority addiction."" My solutions for individuals and society are <em>mindful self rule</em> and <em>personal democracy</em>, which the last two sections of the book show how to practice. The book offers many examples to help readers visualize themselves <em>making life choices that make global sense.</em></p>
<p style=""margin-left: 30px;"">Interweaving the investigation and how-to sections are scenes from my own life story, such as childhood abuse and teenage rebellion, Vietnam war protests in Washington DC (eerily akin to today's Occupy movement), a youthful taste of spiritual enlightenment, joining and leaving a cult, entering journalism, speaking about new media in Bogota, landing in Fiji during a military coup, sensing ghosts at Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, being dumbstruck by touring Gandhi's home in Mumbai, meeting the woman of my dreams online, honeymooning in the UK, standing alone inside Stonehenge at sunset, and more.</p>
<p>In essence, because we all are globally interconnected, everything we think, feel, say and do impacts the world (by design or default), so we may as well live deliberately. Through our daily choices, each of us can help build the momentum for a quantum shift of humanity into global consciousness. <em>Global Sense</em> can help us reach the ""tipping point"" before it's too late.</p>
<h2>How big is the global audience for <em>Global Sense</em>?<strong></strong>
</h2>
<p>The book publishing industry estimates the likely market for any title by calculating the total number of possible readers and then asking what happens if one percent (1%) of them actually buy the book. If this number is enough for the book to be profitable after all related expenses (e.g., design, printing, distribution, and marketing), then the business proposition is valid, and the project is worth backing.</p>
<p>What about the market for <em>Global Sense</em>? From my own market research over the past decade, I’ve identified a dozen “psychographic” interest groups that exhibit awareness of our global connectivity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Human Potential Seekers     </li>
<li>Spiritual Growth Seekers    </li>
<li>Conscious Consumers    </li>
<li>Technology Futurists     </li>
<li>Natural Capitalists      </li>
<li>Environmentalists</li>
<li>Educationâ€ˆ&amp; Literacy Activists</li>
<li>Gender Liberation Activists</li>
<li>Economic Justice Activists</li>
<li>Workers’ Rights Activists</li>
<li>Civil Rights Activists </li>
<li>Peace Activists</li>
</ul>
<p>When I account for overlap, <em>the members of these interest groups represent about 15 percent of all adults in industrialized nations. </em>(The 15 percent figure was calculated from total subscriber and member counts for relevant special interest publications and organizations in the United States, then extrapolated internationally.)</p>
<ul>
<li>My own findings are backed up by the Natural Marketing Institute, which in 2011 reported that <em>13 to 19 percent of all U.S. adults comprise a robust $290 billion market of conscious “LOHAS” consumers</em> (Lifestyles Of Health And Sustainability). These ""cultural creatives"" make purchases based upon ethics as much or more than price. They favor natural foods, holistic health, hybrid cars, ecotourism, voluntourism, solar and wind power, plus other sustainable goods and services. <em>The Nuovon consultancy in Australia estimates the global LOHAS market at about $600 billion annually.</em><strong> <br/>    <br/></strong>
</li>
<li>If a core group of at least 15 percent of all adults in industrialized nations think globally, if we add 10 percent in developing lands, plus 5 percent in undeveloped nations, given 4.9 billion adults on earth over age 15, this equals <em>at least 500 million people with global sense on earth today. </em>Your presence at Indiegogo suggests you are among those with global sense.<em><strong> </strong></em>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If one percent (1 percent) of the 500 million global audience reads </em>Global Sense,<em> this would mean 5 million copies influencing individual lives and society as a whole, speeding up the day that we reach the pivotal tipping point where we can create a sustainable future<strong>.</strong></em></p>
<p>Frankly, I'd be grateful to see a ""market penetration"" at a tenth of one percent, yielding 500,000 copies sold, or a hundredth of one percent, yielding 50,000 copies sold. In terms of my business model, either would be profitable. However, my primary goal here is global change, and for this to happen, if I am going to be true to my soul, I cannot afford to play small.</p>
<h2>Why seek crowdfunding for the book?</h2>
<p>I am now publishing <em>Global Sense</em> through print-on-demand (POD), which supports online sales through bookseller websites serving the U.S., Canada, UK, Europe, and soon Australia. I also am publishing the 2012 edition as an ebook, which is ideal for online sales and downloads.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<em>My problem is that actual bookstores and libraries rarely order print-on-demand books,</em> which still carry the stigma of low quality. This stigma is fading, partly because of books like mine that meet the highest publishing industry standards for editing and design, but the barriers to traditional market entry for POD books remain high.<br/><br/>

<h3>What exactly will your money do?</h3>
<p>The book publishing business, like any business, is about thin profits in the margins.

Where on the planet a book is printed affects this unit cost, too. I will find the most affordable green and ethical printer available.</p>
<p>My 276-page trade paperback book costs around $5 (USD) per copy to print-on-demand with digital presses located in the U.S., UK and soon Australia.

<ul>
<li>
<em>If your support of $10,000 to $20,000 or more allows me to print 5,000 to 10,00 of clothcover (hardbound) books in advance, my unit cost can come down, </em>perhaps to $2-3 per copy, which will mean a viable net profit per book, which I will reinvest to pay for significantly expanded distribution and marketing. <br/>      </li>

GLOBAL SENSE reveals the way the world really works and how a sense of our global oneness empowers us to change the world from within ourselves.
Uniting inner spirituality and personal growth with ecological awareness and grassroots politics, Global Sense brings our highest ideals down to earth where we can use them. Inspired by Thomas Paine’s history-changing 1776 essay, Common Sense, Global Sense: The 2012 Edition offers reasons for hope in these times that try our souls.
If you support robust marketing, printing and international distribution of my award-winning book, Global Sense: The 2012 Edition, you can help to awaken people worldwide. (Please visit the book website at GlobalSense.com)
Please see the growing list of contributors with links their websites posted at GlobalSense.com/community/crowdfunders/
About the Book


Global Sense explains and promotes the power of our global interactivity to transform the world through our individual actions (this very same connectivity empowers crowdfunding). Global Sense aims to help society reach the pivotal ""tipping point"" before it's too late.  
Uniting spiritual enlightenment and personal growth with global thinking and grassroots politics, Global Sense brings our highest ideals down to earth where we can use them.

Audience for the Book


Multiple research sources show that a core group about 15 percent of all adults in the world's industrialized nations have developed a global sensibility. This percentage is slightly lower in the so-called ""third world"" countries.  
Given 4.9 billion adults among 7 billion people on the planet, that 15 percent equals at least 500 million people with global sense on earth today. Growing this base of global thinkers can transform society and help us resolve our global crises together.    

If one percent (1 percent) of the 500 million audience reads Global Sense, this would mean 5 million copies of the book influencing individuals and society as a whole, speeding up the day when we create a sustainable future.

Why crowdfunding is needed


I am currently printing Global Sense for online sales of a trade paperback edition through digital print-on-demand presses in the U.S., UK and (soon) Australia. This involves little up-front capital on my end, however....   
Physical bookstores and libraries almost never order print-on-demand books. They want hardcover (cloth cover) books, which requires traditional advance printing, This severely limits the potential reach of Global Sense and its benefits.  
The solution is printing clothcover books in advance, so one or more of the top book distributors will agree to carry and promote the book to stores and libraries around the world, or at least in the English-reading nations.  
Conventional cothcover book printing can be pricey. The cost-per copy hinges on the amount of copies printed once the presses are running. The more books that I can afford to print at once, the lower the unit cost for these books.  
Strong support for this crowdfunding campaign is essential for persuading one or more top distributors to carry Global Sense, since they will see the book has a strong market base.

How your contribution will be used

Your contribution will support printing clothcover editions of Global Sense after securing trade distribution to retail chains, independent booksellers, libraries, colleges, and universities throughout the English-reading world.   
Reaching the full $22,000 goal will allow the printing and distribution of clothcover books throughout English-reading nations. Lesser funding will support printing and distribution at a proportional level.

If total funding is below $5,000, since that will not be enough for advance printing of a hardbound edition, your contribution instead will go toward the marketing the POD edition, so I can earn enough though online sales to print the clothcover edition.

My qualifications to do what I propose

I was trained in book marketing and publicity by the same people who trained Deepak Chopra, Jack Canfield, Mark Victor Hansen, John Gray, Robert Kiyosaki, and other best-selling authors who started as unknowns. 

Along with 30 years of professional experience as a local to global journalist, I've managed marketing, public relations and advertising campaigns for major organizations and cultural institutions. I'm already applying this skill toward marketing Global Sense assertively.

My extensive book industry knowledge flows from membership and leadership in such trade organizations as the Independent Book Publisher Association (IBPA), American Society of Journalists and Authors, Colorado Independent Publishers Association, Colorado Authors League, and Denver Press Club. I founded the 900-member Denver Book Club. Also, I serve diverse clients as a book publishing coach through my own Hoku House in Hawaii.

Benefits from supporting Global Sense


First and foremost, you contribute to people on earth awakening to the deep power of global consciousness as a means for personal and social transformation. You help empower more people to change the world from within themselves, which helps build momentum for the urgently needed quantum cultural shift of humanity into enlightenment.  

You can choose from a set of ""perks"" that may be personally helpful to you and perhaps your organization, depending on the level you choose.

Who else backs the project?


Global Sense has been endorsed by such thought leaders as Bill McKibben, Vandana Shiva, Thom Hartmann, Francis Moore Lappe, Micheal Lerner, and others.

THE FULL PROPOSAL FOR GLOBAL SENSE:


Please consider supporting international printing and distribution for the new 2012 edition of my award-winning book, GLOBAL SENSE: A spiritual handbook on the nature of society and how to change the world by changing ourselves.
Global Sense explains and promotes the power of our global interactivity to transform the world through our individual actions -- the exact same power of connectivity that fuels global crowdfunding on Indiegogo. Global Sense won the 2012 Silver Nautilus Award for Best Social Change Book. Previous editions have won awards for best social change book and best personal growth book along with being featured on C-SPAN Book TV (USA). The revised edition is a full rewrite and expansion with a major focus on practical tools and tips that readers can apply in real life.
Uniting spiritual enlightenment and personal growth with global thinking and grassroots politics, Global Sense brings our highest ideals down to earth where we can use them.
Inspired by Thomas Paine's history-changing 1776 essay, Common Sense, the 2012 edition of Global Sense offers reasons for hope in these dark times that try our souls. We truly can build our world anew in the 21st century.
At the heart of the book is an historical investigation into the causes of today's global environmental and economic crises, which I identify as ""alpha male rule"" and ""authority addiction."" My solutions for individuals and society are mindful self rule and personal democracy, which the last two sections of the book show how to practice. The book offers many examples to help readers visualize themselves making life choices that make global sense.
Interweaving the investigation and how-to sections are scenes from my own life story, such as childhood abuse and teenage rebellion, Vietnam war protests in Washington DC (eerily akin to today's Occupy movement), a youthful taste of spiritual enlightenment, joining and leaving a cult, entering journalism, speaking about new media in Bogota, landing in Fiji during a military coup, sensing ghosts at Hagia Sophia in Istanbul, being dumbstruck by touring Gandhi's home in Mumbai, meeting the woman of my dreams online, honeymooning in the UK, standing alone inside Stonehenge at sunset, and more.
In essence, because we all are globally interconnected, everything we think, feel, say and do impacts the world (by design or default), so we may as well live deliberately. Through our daily choices, each of us can help build the momentum for a quantum shift of humanity into global consciousness. Global Sense can help us reach the ""tipping point"" before it's too late.
How big is the global audience for Global Sense?

The book publishing industry estimates the likely market for any title by calculating the total number of possible readers and then asking what happens if one percent (1%) of them actually buy the book. If this number is enough for the book to be profitable after all related expenses (e.g., design, printing, distribution, and marketing), then the business proposition is valid, and the project is worth backing.
What about the market for Global Sense? From my own market research over the past decade, I’ve identified a dozen “psychographic” interest groups that exhibit awareness of our global connectivity:

Human Potential Seekers     
Spiritual Growth Seekers    
Conscious Consumers    
Technology Futurists     
Natural Capitalists      
Environmentalists
Educationâ€ˆ& Literacy Activists
Gender Liberation Activists
Economic Justice Activists
Workers’ Rights Activists
Civil Rights Activists 
Peace Activists

When I account for overlap, the members of these interest groups represent about 15 percent of all adults in industrialized nations. (The 15 percent figure was calculated from total subscriber and member counts for relevant special interest publications and organizations in the United States, then extrapolated internationally.)

My own findings are backed up by the Natural Marketing Institute, which in 2011 reported that 13 to 19 percent of all U.S. adults comprise a robust $290 billion market of conscious “LOHAS” consumers (Lifestyles Of Health And Sustainability). These ""cultural creatives"" make purchases based upon ethics as much or more than price. They favor natural foods, holistic health, hybrid cars, ecotourism, voluntourism, solar and wind power, plus other sustainable goods and services. The Nuovon consultancy in Australia estimates the global LOHAS market at about $600 billion annually.     

If a core group of at least 15 percent of all adults in industrialized nations think globally, if we add 10 percent in developing lands, plus 5 percent in undeveloped nations, given 4.9 billion adults on earth over age 15, this equals at least 500 million people with global sense on earth today. Your presence at Indiegogo suggests you are among those with global sense. 


If one percent (1 percent) of the 500 million global audience reads Global Sense, this would mean 5 million copies influencing individual lives and society as a whole, speeding up the day that we reach the pivotal tipping point where we can create a sustainable future.
Frankly, I'd be grateful to see a ""market penetration"" at a tenth of one percent, yielding 500,000 copies sold, or a hundredth of one percent, yielding 50,000 copies sold. In terms of my business model, either would be profitable. However, my primary goal here is global change, and for this to happen, if I am going to be true to my soul, I cannot afford to play small.
Why seek crowdfunding for the book?
I am now publishing Global Sense through print-on-demand (POD), which supports online sales through bookseller websites serving the U.S., Canada, UK, Europe, and soon Australia. I also am publishing the 2012 edition as an ebook, which is ideal for online sales and downloads.


My problem is that actual bookstores and libraries rarely order print-on-demand books, which still carry the stigma of low quality. This stigma is fading, partly because of books like mine that meet the highest publishing industry standards for editing and design, but the barriers to traditional market entry for POD books remain high.


Crowdfunding will support advance printing of a hardbound (clothcover) edition of my book for distribution to retail chains, independent booksellers, public libraries, colleges, and universities throughout the English-reading world. Online sales of ""click-and-order"" POD copies require little up-front capital for me, but supplying the ""brick and mortar"" outlets with clothcover books will require thousands of books being printed in advance, which requires more money than I have available. Your support can enable international book printing and distribution.   


What can be achieved with your support?
Given our pressing need for a profound change in cultural mass consciousness, if you contribute to the printing and distribution of Global Sense, your support can produce global reverberations. 
Once Global Sense is printed for international distribution (with your help), I'm well-grounded in the principles and practices of book promotions.

For starters, I graduated from the Million Dollar Author and year-long Quantum Leap marketing trainings offered in Philadelphia by Bradley Communications. These are the same people who trained Deepak Chopra, Jack Canfield, Mark Victor Hansen, John Gray, Robert Kiyosaki, and other best-selling authors.


When promoting prior editions of Global Sense, for example, I did interviews aired on more than 100 U.S. radio stations, including the nationwide Thom Hartmann Show. I produced a one-hour program on Thomas Paine and Common Sense for a national cable network, C-SPAN's BookTV. For the new 2012 edition of Global Sense, I've already published book excerpts on major websites in the U.S. and UK, and I've barely begun marketing.
As the son of an advertising and marketing executive who literally learned the craft at his father's knee, I've managed many marketing, public relations and advertising campaigns for major organizations and cultural institution. These include the Colorado Symphony, Denver Jazz festival, The Jason Project at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science (live and interactive satellite telecasts from the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea), and numerous big environmental education projects for John Denver's Windstar Foundation based in Aspen, Colorado.
As for book industry knowledge, before my move to Hawaii in 2010, I served as the trade shows chairperson on the board of directors for the Colorado Independent Publishers Association. I also served as president of the Colorado Authors League and two terms on the board of directors for the Denver Press Club. Further, I am the founder of the 900-member Denver Book Club. Nationally, I'm a past-member of the American Society of Journalists and Authors and a current member of the Independent Book Publisher Association (IBPA). All of this publishing industry knowledge is evidenced by my growing base of clients as a book publishing coach at Hoku House in Hawaii.
Given what I know about how to publish and promote quality books, your support for printing and distribution could truly empower Global Sense to go global.
Look at your daily news headlines to see the need for books like mine that can significantly help us to change the world from within ourselves. 


Your support (at any level) really can help humanity reach the ""tipping point"" when global sense makes common sense. Indeed, everything you do every day already matters to us all, so why not use your power wisely?

What exactly will your money do?
The book publishing business, like any business, is about thin profits in the margins. Among the many expenses determining the net revenues, printing and distribution costs (such as warehousing and shipping fees) can mean the difference between profit and loss for any independent publisher.
In book printing, the first cost is setting up the printing presses, which tends to be a relatively fixed cost. The chief variable is the amount of copies printed once the presses are running. Printing a lot of books at once is the best way to obtain the lowest unit cost, that is, the lowest cost-per-book. Where on the planet a book is printed affects this unit cost, too. I will find the most affordable green and ethical printer available.
My 276-page trade paperback book costs around $5 (USD) per copy to print-on-demand with digital presses located in the U.S., UK and soon Australia. When I am selling online, after my discount to the online retailers (so they can earn their profits margins, too), I make about $4 per copy sold. From this income, I need to cover all my marketing and business administration costs, leaving me with at best $1 or less net per book, if even that. This makes it very hard to expand outreach.


If your support of $10,000 to $20,000 or more allows me to print 5,000 to 10,00 of clothcover (hardbound) books in advance, my unit cost can come down, perhaps to $2-3 per copy, which will mean a viable net profit per book, which I will reinvest to pay for significantly expanded distribution and marketing.       

By printing a lot of books in advance, one or more of the top book distributors likely will agree to carry and promote the book, which means Global Sense no longer will be locked out of sales to bookstores and libraries, including the big chain stores, such as the airport bookstores. Incrementally, month by month and year by year, the vision of 5 million copies in print can be realized, strengthening us all for transforming our world.

Reaching the $22,000 goal will allow the printing and distribution of books throughout the English-reading nations. Surpassing the goal will enable even greater outreach. (I will do separate crowdfunding and crowdsourcing projects for translations.) If the entire goal is not reached, your funding still will go toward printing and distribution proportional to the amount raised.
If total funding is below $5,000, since that will not be enough for advance printing of a hardbound edition, your contribution instead will go toward the marketing the POD edition, so I can earn enough though online sales to print the clothcover edition.
Do my ""perks"" provide incentives for you? I hope you see a value in what I'm offering to do for you. If you are considering a contribution for the weekend workshop on Kauai, thank you, and I strongly suggest that you contact me through my website (GlobalSense.com) before making your contribution to guarantee we can make arrangements that work for you.
With advance printing and expanded distribution, I will still net roughly $1 per book, keeping Hoku House in business, but what really matters is that more books will be read overall, which means Global Sense can have a greater social and cultural impact in a shorter period of time, which helps increase the likelihood humanity will make the global changes we urgently need to make now.

What people say about Global Sense:
""I have just finished reading your book, and I feel happy. I easily can follow your thoughts and explanations, and it makes so much sense to me! It feels very real, practical, down to earth. at the same time showing a direction where to go. You explain it so clearly and simply. Many pieces of a puzzle lost in my brain were put together. You see, I love it. I'm European, and not easily carried away by American dreams. I hope that this book reaches a lot of people. I'm sure reading it could help desperate souls regain hope. Every thought, every smile makes a difference!""


Anna Barbara Dütschler, Classical Musician, Switzerland
""Global Sense explodes the old myths that we are essentially evil, that hierarchy and dominance are natural law. Judah Freed reveals how ancient 'male rule' and 'authority addiction' restrain our innate power for self government. Democracy can work, he argues, when we are willing to do the personal and spiritual growth needed to manage our freedom and society responsibly.""


Thom Hartmann, syndicated radio talk show host, author, Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight, Rebooting the American Dream, Threshold, Cracking the Code, Unequal Protection, The Edison Gene, What Would Jefferson Do?

""Global Sense is about personal and social transformation, starting with the inner self feeling a genuine recognition of our rights and responsibilities. The book is a declaration of our global interdependence rooted in Gandhi's principle of personal sovereignty.""


Dr. Vandana Shiva, scientist, environmental activist, author, Stolen Harvest, Water Wars, Earth Democracy

""Thomas Paine rallied Americans to a new sense of themselves and their possibilities. Judah Freed does likewise for citizens of the planet.""

Malidoma Some, author, Of Water and the Spirit

Dave Wann, co-author, Affluenza; author, Simple Prosperity, Rebuilding Community

""Judah Freed reminds us of the continuing relevance of American patriot Thomas Paine while transforming Paine's message of democracy and human rights into the spiritually-rich and psychologically-informed discourse of the 21st century.""

</p><h3></h3><p>I was in the middle of a
book.</p>
<p>In October 2009, between
Paris and San Francisco, a comedy solo tour on gender in five languages, a
book, a screenplay, and workshops on queer creativity for Europunks, I talked
my mom into letting me weave her fifty life stories into mine, to create a
two-generation political memoir. Life was about to get busy.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">My mother was a fashion
diva born in the Weimar republic and raised in the Third Reich, where she was
made to salute the swastika, say Heil Hitler instead of hi, wear the uniform of
child fascists, and work in a Nazi weapons factory. After the war, a commie
aptitude test decided she wasn’t geared to be a dress designer after all, but a
machinist in grey coveralls, again. On her way to another hell job with dirty
old men under other authoritarians, she jumped the iron curtain and fled to the
west. If she were going to work for an allied power, it would be a civilized
one. She flirted her way into working for the Americans. Her heroes, who in one
way had burned down her house, killed her father, imprisoned her mother behind
the iron curtain, and taken everything, had liberated her from a life of dread
and repression. It was complicated.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">She married my dad. They
flew to the states and in 1958 had me. My babysitter was a library instead of a
TV. They showed me the world, from the Berlin wall to Anne Frank’s house to
Auschwitz, from the backcountry of the Sierras to the Haight, all the while
interpreting it in terms of freedom. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">That’s where I got my
crazy ideas about right and wrong and what to do about it.</span></p>
<p>Cut to the fall of 2009.
<span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Mom was eating, drinking and being Mary with her gay pals in Berlin, like every
year on vacation. I was on tour while remotely fighting an eviction. My future
was uncertain and the end was always near. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Just outside of Santa
Fe, I got the call.</span> Mom had been found on the bathroom floor of a hair salon,
with a stroke that left her brain-damaged and half paralyzed.<span style=""font-weight: normal;""> I called the
hospital.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">She said, “I’m ok.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">OK is what she always was,
especially when she wasn’t.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I flew to Berlin. Leaning
on her hospital bed, I recited the only prayer she ever taught me as a child, a
German one: “Dear God, make me pure so I can go to heaven.“</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">“Yeah, but not now,” she
retorted.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Mom stroke plus eviction
equals snake eyes! I was going to be evicted. Mom couldn’t live alone. I’d give
up my charmed life and become a stay-at-home dad with a 150-pound baby. But
first, months of stabilizing in Berlin hospitals, navigating legal, medical,
insurance and emotional mazes in German and English, organizing friends to
visit before Mom left her home town never to return, calming abused nurses,
crying in ante rooms, and sometimes laughing.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">If I’d lost my mother all
at once I wouldn’t have broken open so slow. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I tried to reach what I
thought to be her now basic thought processes. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">“Mom, when life gives
you lemons, make lemonade. “</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">She said, “Why would
anyone make lemonade to feel better. They ought to make a martini.”</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I’d come out, done
drugs, got sober, toured the world, come out again as trans. I’d been a comic,
writer, director, actor, homocore yeller, but my biggest transition was yet to
happen.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Mom was a fighter. She
might, like the heroes of stroke recovery books, crawl on the ground until she
learned to walk, but more likely she’d choose not to and demand to be waited

thing she asked for was a motorized wheelchair. I told her vehicular
