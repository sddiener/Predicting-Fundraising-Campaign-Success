<p>Beginning in September, I will embark on a 6-month cultural exchange adventure with Canada World Youth (CWY). Together with 17 other young people, I will be spending 3 months in Victoriaville, Quebec, followed by an unimaginably exciting 3 months in Benin (West Africa). </p>
<p>During the program, I will be <span>contributing to community-driven development projects which focus on the environment. In addition, I will be developing my leadership skills, learning a new language (French), and building bridges between my own culture(s) and those of my host communities.

<p>All youth participants are expected to fundraise $3200 to go towards the cost of the program. I need your help to make this possible, so read on!</p>
<h3>Why This Matters To Me</h3>
<p>There is no better way of learning about yourself and the world around you than by hitting the road and meeting new people. As a newcomer to Canada, I look forward to learning more about this country and its people during the first part of my exchange, in particular the unique French culture of Quebec. I also hope to learn more about the environmental work being done here at home and overseas, and how I can contribute to it. </p>
<p>Mostly, I hope to challenge myself to be a better person, and build human ties with people who are from different geographical, cultural, linguistic, and socioeconomic backgrounds than myself. To me, this is the absolute best way I can think of to spend what remains of my youth.</p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>All youth volunteers are expected to fundraise $3200 to take part in this program, which represents a fraction of the overall cost of the program. In addition to mitigating the cost, the fundraising goal is intended to help spread the word about CWY to keep this amazing opportunity open for future generations. </p>
<p>Although I will be contributing the majority of this amount out of my own savings, I would appreciate ALL THE HELP I can get from my friends, families, and generous acquaintances to help me reach the full fundraising amount! I have set a $1000 personal fundraising goal, and will contribute the rest myself.</p>
<p>All contributions are greatly appreciated, no matter how big or small. Everyone who contributes $10 or more will get a postcard from Benin! If you are able to contribute $25 or more, you will be rewarded with a personal, hand-drawn postcard from my adventures in Benin :)</p>

<p>We are a team of five master
students from Delft’s University of Technology in the Netherlands, doing our
Joint Master Program, as part of our academic formation. We come from different
parts of the world with an open mind and desire to explore, design, inspire and
play. Our team is Sandra (Romania), Katerina (Greece), Kiki (The Netherlands),
Nicoló (Italy) and Christian (Colombia). We combine our professional and
cultural experiences to forge meaningful concepts and turn them into feasible
projects, with the aim to help improve the quality of life. </p>

We
are excited to work in the Ghanaian context; the culture, the youth and everything
that culture has to offer in order to inspire the team and the out coming ideas
for the project<p></p>
<h3><b>Design, inspire, play..</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>Our project deals with the
impact of increasing urbanization on the play environments and habits of
children in Accra. The goal of the project developed for Mmofra foundation is
within the scope of stimulating, enhancing and maintaining the creativity of
children in Ghana during their childhood. We want our project to help
them recreate their playful universe enhancing and stimulating their creativity
while strengthen their cultural heritage.</p>
<p>To successfully provide the best and feasible
solution, a cultural research hast to be conducted on location (in Accra),
where we will first spend one month. We will go back to Delft, and after the
analysis we want to actually implement our results and ideas, for which we will
go back to Accra for one more month. We want to use as much local and
traditional as possible, and try to enhance children’s connection with the Ghanaian
cultural heritage.</p>
<p></p>
<h3><b>Mmofra foundation</b></h3>
<p>Our design team will complete the project with
the support of Mmofra foundation (<a href=""http://mmofraghana.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">See link</a>), a non-profit organization based in Accra. Research
will be conducted in the field, ideas and prototypes will be developed and
finally validation processes will lead to the final product.</p>
<p>In one of the Ghana’s languages, Akan, 
Mmofra means “children” , who are the main focus of the foundation. The main
goal of the foundation is to enrich the cultural and intellectual lives of all
the children in Ghana. Programs and products are developed in order to make
children in Ghana aware of their cultural routs and become creative outside
classroom.</p>
<p>The foundation was found by Efua T. Sutherland
(1924-1996), a famous Ghanaian writer and educator. From the early 1950’s to
the 1990’s she tried to develop education, literature, theater and film for
children in Ghana.  From 1997, the foundation was open to children from
all backgrounds and the dream of its founder has become real.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the contribution of the foundation
includes workshops and exhibitions in visual arts literacy and public health
initiatives, book and audio-visual development , active cultural recovery and
reinforcement, cross-cultural exposure, and data collection.</p>
<p>One of
the main projects developed by Mmofra foundation is the Playtime in Africa Initiative (<a href=""http://mmofraghana.org/our-work/playtime-in-africa-initiative/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">See link</a>).</p>
<p>Inspired
by the book “Playtime in Africa” published in the early 60s by Efua T. Sutherland
and Willis Bell, Mmofra foundation is in the process of creating an informal
outdoor playground for the children of Accra. Playtime in Africa Initiative is
a child-focused park in the heart of Accra’s Dzorwulu neighborhood which
inspires creativity, fosters<span> play</span> and educates through hands-on discovery. </p>
<h3><b>Your support</b></h3>
<p>As
students and volunteers for this project, we want to get hands on the job and
actually <span>implement something that will help improve the quality of life for the Ghanaian youth.
But this is an objective that
brings along some serious financial challenges. As part of our design process,
context research plays an important role, together with ideation, detailing,
prototyping and implementation. In order to have valuable results and to
validate the utility of our concepts, many of these phases will have to take
place in the actual context of the product, in Accra, Ghana. This is why we
will have to deal with various expenses, from travel expenses for the research,
prototyping materials and hand labor.  We appreciate any help you can
provide in order to make feasible the materialization of our project and
support the youth in Ghana. We
consider that it is never too
late to have a start and a
meaningful contribution.</span></p>
<p>We would

<h3>Our History</h3>
<p>The Coalition for Positive Sexuality (CPS) is a grassroots volunteer group formed in 1992 by high school and college students, teachers, and activists in Chicago. The AIDS epidemic, queer-bashing, and concerns about teen pregnancy sparked our desire to provide teens with accurate, positive, empowering sexuality and safe-sex information. We worked with teenagers to create a sex education booklet that covered birth control, STDs, safe-sex practices, HIV/AIDS, pregnancy prevention, abortion rights, and sexual identity without preaching abstinence or denying sexual pleasure. We wanted to contribute to a teen peer culture that would eventually make sexual ignorance unacceptable.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The aim of the project is to answer a set of cool (sometimes even weird) questions about savanna's wildlife, from the field, in the form of a <strong>scientific photoblog</strong> updated twice a month. Every chapter will come with illustrative and <strong>creative pictures</strong> taken in the savanna. You will receive every chapter either in your email or printed ! <br/>The final product is <strong>a book</strong> about wildlife wonders and curiosities.</p>
From march to october, this project will show you that <strong>The Lion's King producers didn't tell you everything</strong> there is to know about savanna’s wildlife.<br/><br/>

<h3>My story</h3>
I am a <strong>young researcher in behavioural ecology</strong>, working on zebras and giraffes. My own research project focuses on mammal's behaviour, but i am very interested in photojournalism as well. I will spent 7 months in the savanna of the <strong>Hwange National Park</strong> (Zimbabwe) to conduct the fieldwork of my scientific research, and will be surrounded almost every day by iconics animals such as lions, kudus and elephants. I found myself so lucky that <strong>i wanted to share it all around.</strong> You can make it possible !<br/><br/>

<p>“Knowing that people are helping just a poor little school in a big place, it makes me feel important.” -12-year-old Sebastian, a member of the band at I.S. 171 (Listen at <a href=""http://cbsloc.al/UEy2Zr"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://cbsloc.al/UEy2Zr</a>)</p>
<p>More details on our fundraising goal and how we plan to reach it are below.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Band's Story:</h3>
<p>At I.S. 171, a middle school in the low-income Cypress Hills/East New York, Brooklyn neighborhood, <strong>there is no music education during the school day</strong>. For many years, the school’s instruments, dusty and forgotten, were locked up in a closet.<br/><br/>Three years ago, a local nonprofit stepped in to bring the joy of music back: they started up the school band in their afterschool program. It was a huge success!<br/><br/>About 35 students each year learned to play instruments and read music. At the band concerts, the kids and families beamed with pride. Students moved from beginner to advanced band and some earned scholarships to join the jazz program at the Brooklyn Conservatory of Music! That’s an all-but-unheard-of opportunity in the Cypress Hills/East New York neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>But the school band’s funding ran out at the end of the 2011-2012 school year. Right now, kids are back in school, but there is no band.</strong> The instruments are once again locked up in a closet.<br/><br/>After the band’s final concert 2011, one 12-year-old boy asked, “Do I have to give my trombone back?” The staff said yes, and explained that the instruments belonged to the school. The boy handed over his trombone but, as he did, he burst into tears. His family, like almost all families at IS 171, does not have enough money to rent an instrument.<br/><br/>This band was changing lives. We need to save it.<br/><br/>The nonprofit, <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/CHLDC"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""CHLDC"">Cypress Hills Local Development Corporation</a> (CHLDC), and the music instructors from the <a href=""http://www.bqcm.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Brooklyn Conservatory of Music"">Brooklyn Queens Conservatory of Music</a> are ready to restart the I.S. 171 band as soon as the funds are raised – as early as mid-to-late October -- so the kids get as much time to practice as possible. But they can’t do it without your help.<br/><br/><em><strong>Every kid should have the chance to play an instrument in school, but the kids at I.S. 171 won’t – unless we make it happen. So let's do it. Let's save the middle school band!</strong></em></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Budget</h3>
<p>The total cost of running that band for one school year is $38,000. Here’s what that covers:<br/><br/>Program Director:                $3,200<br/>Site Director:                      $2,315<br/>Music Instructors*:              $29,750</p>
<p>Administrative Overhead:     $2,735</p>
<p>TOTAL:                              $38,000</p>
<p>*Includes 20 weeks of instruction, two days per week, for 6 teachers (to be able to provide lessons for all the instruments during afterschool time), as well as time for concerts and special events</p>
<p><strong><em>""But guys, your page is only for $15,000!""</em></strong></p>
<p>That's true. We're hoping the page will exceed its goal, but we're also doing other things to raise additional funds:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>If our campaign brings in $28,000, Wynton Marsalis and Mark Patterson have offered to contribute the remaining $10,000 to bring us to our goal of $38,000!</strong></p>
</li>
<li>
<strong><a href=""http://www.thetalentshowbrandvarietyshow.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""The Talent Show"">The Talent Show Brand Variety Show</a> </strong>hosted a show on October 2, starring comedians Hannibal Buress, Eugene Mirman, Michael Showalter, Dave Hill, and more, and generously donated all proceeds to our campaign. The show raised more than $2,500! A follow-up video will be released soon, starring the comedians from the show, to draw more attention to the cause!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>We have raised more than $5,000 in additional offline donations, as well.

</ul>
<p>Even if we don’t reach the total goal, donations will still bring as much music as possible back to the kids in Cypress Hills -- we will restructure the program based on the amount raised (i.e. offer a band, but for fewer weeks of the year).</p>
<p><strong>Please note: because CHLDC is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, donations are tax deductible. </strong>We will send you a receipt for tax purposes.</p>
<p>And for those who are wondering, <strong>“<em>If we raise the funds for 2012-2013, so what? Won’t the band be in the same pickle next year?</em>”</strong> Good news:</p>
<p>We will be applying for a NYS government grant for the 2013-2014 school year. It’s the grant that supported the band the last 3 years, but there’s no funding available this year because of government cuts. This is devastating for the kids who would otherwise be continuing in band and those who'd hoped to join.<br/><br/><em><strong>Your gift will directly support music education for middle school students in Cypress Hills/East New York.

</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact and Other Ways to Help</h3>
<p>If you played an instrument or did anything creative when you were in middle school (and probably even if you didn’t), you probably know what a big deal this is. Sometimes band is the only thing to look forward to.</p>
<p>But even if you loved middle school, the school band has an impact far beyond having fun and learning to read notes – it helps kids build confidence, work as a team, learn to really listen, develop a new passion, and appreciate jazz, classical music, and the arts a whole lot more.</p>
<p>Any amount you can give will help bring the music program back to the kids at I.S. 171.</p>
<p><strong>And please, please, whether you can donate or not, spread the word about the campaign!</strong> Share this page on Facebook, Twitter, whatever other newfangled network you’re using these days – let people know they can be part of saving the music for some amazing kids.</p>

<p>We are a tiny company called Languages Out There (LOT) and publish the world's first social media English course called English Out There (EOT).</p>
<p>EOT works with Facebook and Skype and can transform the English speaking ability of long-term frustrated learners. It is inexpensive for the students but can help teachers to start their own businesses.</p>
<p>We have developed our content over 11 years and have only made a tiny profit in the last two years. It has not been at all easy.</p>
<p>Over <strong>ALMOST THREE YEARS</strong> we provided privileged and confidential information about our unique content to <strong>Oxford University Press</strong> (OUP) because they said they were interested in our content. </p>
<p>In March of this year they wrote to us,</p>
<p><em>""we do not feel that LOT offers the type of materials that we could bring within our catalogue, whether in relation to the current offering or our future plans.""</em> </p>
<p><strong>JUST FIVE MONTHS LATER</strong> they launched a new five level English course book series with the words,</p>
<p><em>""Network is the first course to use social networking to help students succeed in English.""</em></p>
<p>The first three English teachers we sent the OUP product link (just the link, nothing else), said this:</p>
<p><em> <img alt=""Nellie Gchat"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://i399.photobucket.com/albums/pp77/jasonoutthere/Nellie_D_on_Gchat_re_OUP_first_look_Aug_2012.png"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Teacher comments on OUP Network Get Connected""/></em></p>

<p>Click <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0ueA-jCKGY"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""EOTvOUP_long_video"">HERE</a> for our long video with detailed timeline and evidence.</p>

<p>There's obviously something wrong at the biggest academic publisher in the world. OUP were recently banned by the World Bank for bribery in Kenya and paid £4.2m to settle a corruption case with the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO).</p>

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<ul>
<li>We have consulted a top IP lawyer who has looked at the evidence and says we have good claims for passing off and copyright infringement. We now need to prepare our case properly.</li>
<li>In the first instance OUP will probably play the 'they can't afford to lose' card and ask us to put a large amount of money into court (this is how it works!).</li>
<li>So, we would lose just on the basis of being small and having no money.</li>
<li>We need at least £20,000 ($30,000) to start with and we need to know we have your support, because a case like this could cost £50-60,000 in total.</li>
<li>If we don't hit our target we will use the money to go as far as we can and then fund some programming work on our website that will help us to make money by giving our content away (we have another innovative idea!).</li>
<li>None of your money will be wasted, we promise.</li>
</ul><h3>What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>$10 gets you OR ANYONE YOU PROVIDE THE EMAIL ADDRESS OF a 60 hour English Out There self-study social media English course (download of PDFs and MP3s). You can see the courses <a href=""http://englishoutthere.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Social Media English Courses"">here</a>
</li>
<li>$40 gets you or someone you want to give them to the complete set of self-study courses (6 levels, 360 hours of study) OR one 60 hour level of teacher's English Out There (with a licence for one teacher to use commercially)</li>
<li>$200 gets you or a teacher you provide the email address of the complete set of OO English Out There materials for teaching one-to-one and online in virtual classrooms and with online social networks like Facebook.com and social learning management systems like Edmodo.com</li>
<li>$1000 gets you a complete set of teacher's materials with a licence for five teachers to use commercially PLUS a live webinar and Q&amp;A for as many people as you like with creator and founder of EOT, Jason West</li>
<li>$3000 gets your company or school a full set of teacher's materials, a licence for up to 15 teachers to use them commercially forever and a live webinar PLUS unlimited online support and online elearning consultancy for a month from EOT creator and founder Jason West</li>
</ul><h3>Why Is This Important</h3>
<p>EOT is the only English course in the world that is proven (we have audio before and after case studies with randomly selected students) to help learners go from beginner to intermediate speakers in weeks.</p>
<p>Probably the world's most famous expert on language acquisition and English teaching and learning, listened to this <a href=""http://languagesoutthere.podomatic.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""Social Media English Course Evidence"">before and after audio case study</a> with Jane, a typical 27 year old Chinese learner and commented,</p>
<p><strong>""Remarkable...a major contribution to what we know works."" </strong>Professor Stephen Krashen (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Krashen"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Krashen</a>)</p>
<p>In the right hands and at the right price EOT is capable of helping millions of English learners to improve their life prospects. A recent <a href=""http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2011/jul/05/research-backs-english-language-delotbiniere"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" title=""English Speakers Earn More"">British Council report</a> showed that being able to speak English comfortably increases someone's lifetime earnings by a minimum of 25%.</p>
<p>This is why OUP showed so much interest in EOT. The global ELT market is estimated to be worth over $60bn per year.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't donate or buy some EOT content perks here don't worry, you can still sign our <a href=""http://petition.avaaz.org/en/petition/Make_Oxford_University_Press_OUP_Explain_Their_Actions/?cYNgXbb"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""EOTvOUP epetition Avaaz"">e-petition</a> to the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University in which we demand that he pays for an independent legal inquiry that will provide a full and public explanation of the behaviour of #OUPELT's employees.</p>

We are a tiny company called Languages Out There (LOT) and publish the world's first social media English course called English Out There (EOT).
EOT works with Facebook and Skype and can transform the English speaking ability of long-term frustrated learners. It is inexpensive for the students but can help teachers to start their own businesses.
We have developed our content over 11 years and have only made a tiny profit in the last two years. It has not been at all easy.
Over ALMOST THREE YEARS we provided privileged and confidential information about our unique content to Oxford University Press (OUP) because they said they were interested in our content. 
In March of this year they wrote to us,
""we do not feel that LOT offers the type of materials that we could bring within our catalogue, whether in relation to the current offering or our future plans."" 
JUST FIVE MONTHS LATER they launched a new five level English course book series with the words,
""Network is the first course to use social networking to help students succeed in English.""
The first three English teachers we sent the OUP product link (just the link, nothing else), said this:
 
 

Click HERE for our long video with detailed timeline and evidence.
Click HERE for the OUP video of Kristin Sherman (author) talking about teaching English using social media.
This is from OUP's published Code of Conduct document on their website:

There's obviously something wrong at the biggest academic publisher in the world. OUP were recently banned by the World Bank for bribery in Kenya and paid £4.2m to settle a corruption case with the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO).
 
What We Need

We have consulted a top IP lawyer who has looked at the evidence and says we have good claims for passing off and copyright infringement. We now need to prepare our case properly.
In the first instance OUP will probably play the 'they can't afford to lose' card and ask us to put a large amount of money into court (this is how it works!).
So, we would lose just on the basis of being small and having no money.
We need at least £20,000 ($30,000) to start with and we need to know we have your support, because a case like this could cost £50-60,000 in total.
If we don't hit our target we will use the money to go as far as we can and then fund some programming work on our website that will help us to make money by giving our content away (we have another innovative idea!).
None of your money will be wasted, we promise.
What You Get

$10 gets you OR ANYONE YOU PROVIDE THE EMAIL ADDRESS OF a 60 hour English Out There self-study social media English course (download of PDFs and MP3s). You can see the courses here

$40 gets you or someone you want to give them to the complete set of self-study courses (6 levels, 360 hours of study) OR one 60 hour level of teacher's English Out There (with a licence for one teacher to use commercially)
$200 gets you or a teacher you provide the email address of the complete set of OO English Out There materials for teaching one-to-one and online in virtual classrooms and with online social networks like Facebook.com and social learning management systems like Edmodo.com
$1000 gets you a complete set of teacher's materials with a licence for five teachers to use commercially PLUS a live webinar and Q&A for as many people as you like with creator and founder of EOT, Jason West
$3000 gets your company or school a full set of teacher's materials, a licence for up to 15 teachers to use them commercially forever and a live webinar PLUS unlimited online support and online elearning consultancy for a month from EOT creator and founder Jason West
Why Is This Important
EOT is the only English course in the world that is proven (we have audio before and after case studies with randomly selected students) to help learners go from beginner to intermediate speakers in weeks.
Probably the world's most famous expert on language acquisition and English teaching and learning, listened to this before and after audio case study with Jane, a typical 27 year old Chinese learner and commented,
""Remarkable...a major contribution to what we know works."" Professor Stephen Krashen (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Krashen)
In the right hands and at the right price EOT is capable of helping millions of English learners to improve their life prospects. A recent British Council report showed that being able to speak English comfortably increases someone's lifetime earnings by a minimum of 25%.
This is why OUP showed so much interest in EOT. The global ELT market is estimated to be worth over $60bn per year.
Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't donate or buy some EOT content perks here don't worry, you can still sign our e-petition to the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University in which we demand that he pays for an independent legal inquiry that will provide a full and public explanation of the behaviour of #OUPELT's employees.
And don't forget to use the Indiegogo share tools here too!
Thanks for reading this, watching the video and giving us your support in any way that you can.
Together we can win this battle of David and Goliath and strike a big blow for small creators and companies all over the world who fear exactly the same happening to their hard work and creative lifeblood.

<p>Center for Africa Missions is an outreach organization that focuses on reaching the underprivileged in communities and villages across Ghana through education and community development programs, i.e., building schools and digging water wells in remote villages, as well as feeding programs and establishing after-school activities at our main Center to prevent children being left to themselves.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>What we need</strong></p>
<p>Our biggest need right now is to purchase a bus to enable us to bring in at risk children to our main Center in Prampram. These children are compromised in society because they’re not in school and mainly left alone from a very young age while parents are at work or simply absent.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Why we need it</strong></p>
<p>When children are left to themselves the consequences are usually negative such as teenage pregnancy, stealing and drinking, only to mention a few. If we had a bus, we could transport some of these children to our Center where they receive basic education (reading and writing), participate in extra-curricular activities (soccer, volleyball, choreograph dance, piano and computer training) and character building skills (Ethics and social responsibility). We are doing this already but using our personal cars and the result is disastrous because no child wants to be left behind and we end up with around 20 children crammed into one car! So a bus would be a great asset to correct this situation.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>How much we need and our perks</strong></p>
<p>We need $ 27,000 to purchase an adequate bus (at least 33 seats). Wondering why this amount? Vehicles tend to be more expensive in Africa due to the shipping and duty fees charged at the port of entry, as most of the cars are imported. Our goal also covers for Indiegogo fees charged on the overall amount.</p>
<p>We have fun rewards for your donations ranging from naming a seat on the bus, to hand-painted postcards from the children (with photo), handmade bead-bracelets and the top reward for the highest donation: naming the bus itself!</p>
<p>Our transparency policy regarding your donations:</p>
<p>If we don’t reach our goal, we will still go for a bus but most likely settle for a smaller, less expensive vehicle that does not seat as many children as we would like.</p>
<p>If we go above and beyond, we get our bus plus a smaller 12 seater van to bring in even more children and also serve as a means of transportation for our team when travelling to our various projects in several communities.</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Previous projects</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>We are a small outreach Mission and many of our projects have been successful so far. For example, we have established two primary schools. Deveme Community School located in the Eastern Region of Ghana has been running for eight years now. It started with 50 kids under a mango tree and nowadays has 300 students. The first class will be writing their BECE exams at the end of this academic year.</li>
<li>Akorlikope Community School is located in the Volta Region of Ghana and was completed early this year. They currently have 60 students. Also we put a well to bring potable water to the people in this community.</li>
<li>We have our Annual Youth Summer Camp in Keta which had a very successful first edition in 2012 with more than 500 youth registered. Definitely to be repeated this August.  And the bus we are appealing for in this project will also help us bring kids to the Summer Camp.  </li>

<h1>Think, stylus in the future</h1>
<p>Writing and drawing are the nature of the human. Either on the paper or on iPad, you need a pen to release your inspiration. What will a pen in the future be? Pen+ stylus may be one of the answers.</p>
<p>To design the stationery in the future is a great dream to us. We bring it to Kickstarter, hoping to share our dream with more people. Therefore, we call the stylus the DREAMER.</p>
<div class=""template asset""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/ksr/assets/000/325/333/8d36475850fb041c28b0330d17bd939a_large.jpg?1357286103"" src="""" style=""""/></div>
<h1>Use button to switch your inspiration</h1>
<p>The most important feature of the DREAMER is its button. The design idea is from Apple Inc, as the button on iPad, iPhone, and iPod. It is unique, futuristic. By pushing the button, you switch between two modes of the stylus, therefore switch your inspiration of creation.</p>

<p>Just as Apple is proud of its unibody production technology, DREAMER's body is made from an entire piece of aerospace grade aluminium using CNC precise machine tool. Therefore, it looks elegant and attractive.</p>

<h1>Different feel</h1>
<p>With more subtle changes, your hand will feel the differences such as the location of button to use flexibly, diameter of stylus to reduce mis-operation, unique design of the cone-shape Stylus Tip to improve the accuracy of writing, also the proper weight and smooth curve. Everything is just perfect. No matter how you use it, the experience is enjoyable.</p>

<h1>DREAMER helps DREAMER</h1>
<p>Everyone who promotes ideas on Indigogo is a DREAMER. Everyone who reviews the program is also a DREAMER. It is your support and help that make those dreams come true.</p>
<p>On our project DREAMER, our team has been developed for more than seven months, and put in a big amount of money in development, now we have a few prototypes. We need around 20,000 US dollars for later development. This amount is going to be used for a few detail adjustments, development of product mould, and the deposit for volume production in the factory.</p>
<p>As you know, just as Apple set its production factory in China, where you can find great manufacturing production ability. We have competent business partners in China. We will work together and you will be surprised to see our final product.</p>
<p>Glory takes time. We are confident to set our goal -- to get a whole new DREAMER on the very beginning of the March 2013. Please spread the words and share with your friends.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h1> </h1></div>","A stationery to define the future -- Dreamer stylus. No matter you use paper or iPad, a whole new stylus is going to bring you to the future road of inspiration.

Elegance and future
NEWS!
The UDO Studio and VEARI, an Chinese professional stylus brand have reached cooperation, jointly completed DREAMER project, and prepare to expose it to the global market.
Therefore, even if INDIEGOGO financing target cannot be reached, you can get your favorite DREAMER. It is brilliant !
Think, stylus in the future
Writing and drawing are the nature of the human. Either on the paper or on iPad, you need a pen to release your inspiration. What will a pen in the future be? Pen+ stylus may be one of the answers.
To design the stationery in the future is a great dream to us. We bring it to Kickstarter, hoping to share our dream with more people. Therefore, we call the stylus the DREAMER.

Use button to switch your inspiration
The most important feature of the DREAMER is its button. The design idea is from Apple Inc, as the button on iPad, iPhone, and iPod. It is unique, futuristic. By pushing the button, you switch between two modes of the stylus, therefore switch your inspiration of creation.

Unibody design

On iPad / Paper
Elegance of the metal
Just as Apple is proud of its unibody production technology, DREAMER's body is made from an entire piece of aerospace grade aluminium using CNC precise machine tool. Therefore, it looks elegant and attractive.

Unibody design. Aluminum Dreamer Prototype
 
Different feel
With more subtle changes, your hand will feel the differences such as the location of button to use flexibly, diameter of stylus to reduce mis-operation, unique design of the cone-shape Stylus Tip to improve the accuracy of writing, also the proper weight and smooth curve. Everything is just perfect. No matter how you use it, the experience is enjoyable.

DREAMER helps DREAMER
Everyone who promotes ideas on Indigogo is a DREAMER. Everyone who reviews the program is also a DREAMER. It is your support and help that make those dreams come true.
On our project DREAMER, our team has been developed for more than seven months, and put in a big amount of money in development, now we have a few prototypes. We need around 20,000 US dollars for later development. This amount is going to be used for a few detail adjustments, development of product mould, and the deposit for volume production in the factory.
As you know, just as Apple set its production factory in China, where you can find great manufacturing production ability. We have competent business partners in China. We will work together and you will be surprised to see our final product.
Glory takes time. We are confident to set our goal -- to get a whole new DREAMER on the very beginning of the March 2013. Please spread the words and share with your friends.
Thanks.

<h3>Hi my name is MaloRee Allen and I am a third year veterinary student, attending St. George's University of Veterinary Medicine. </h3>
<p>This summer, I'll be embarking on a once in a life time opportunity: joining just 80 veterinary students from around the globe in South Africa to further our careers in veterinary medicine.</p>
<p><strong>A little about me...</strong></p>
<p>I will be finishing up my 3rd year from St. George's University this year, doing my clinical rotations in the US, then I plan on becoming the most kick ass vet I can!</p>
<p>SYMCO presents a chance to get hands on experience in one of the most diverse wildlife locations on the planet. The lessons I learn in those short few weeks will enhance my vetinary prowress for the rest of my life!</p>
<p>This is a HUGE opportunity that very few professionals in my field ever see so attending and maximizing what I learn on the trip could really give me a leg up.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Destination: South Africa</h3>
<p>As you can imagine, flights to and from the other side of the globe don't come cheap, nor does the symposium itself:</p>
<p>Every cent that comes in will go towards paying for my travel expenses and the SYMCO attendance fee. I have managed to cover some costs through various school grants and donations but every bit to help an indebted college student counts!</p>
<p>As a gift to everyone who helps, I promise to bring you back a little piece of South Africa! Check out the various donation tiers to see what goodies could be in store for you.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>When James Lubo Mijak and Ngor Kur Mayol came to the United States from a refugee camp, they wanted to work on their education and find their path, and then find a way to give back to their home, which in 2011 became the world's newest country, South Sudan. Over the last few years, Lubo and Ngor worked together and created the organization <strong>Raising Sudan</strong>. With help from friends, Raising Sudan connected with Mothering Across Continents and raised enough money for two schools. I have known Lubo since he came to the US and settled in Charlotte. This summer, I am joining with the Raising Sudan project to begin the process of offering<strong> teacher training and support to the school in Nyarweng,</strong> Lubo's home village. </p>

<li>Travel to Nyarweng to see the new school and access needs;</li>
<li>Share some basic resources and provide teacher training for new teachers</li>
<li>Make contacts with other schools in South Sudan--provide some teacher training and pursues connections for Nyarweng</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>In an area of the world desperate for education, we hope to begin a relationship of support to offer training, resources, and supplies to the schools in South Sudan. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p class=""ecxCxSpFirst"">The Tingathe Initiative is a community based organization operating out of Chinsapo – a peri-urban area on the outskirts of Lilongwe, Malawi. Chinsapo is one of the most severely affected communities in the country for life expectancy, infant mortality, prevalence of HIV/AIDS, illiteracy, unemployment, and violent crime. Tingathe was born as a means of providing accessible education for people of all ages who would otherwise be left without option.</p>
<p class=""ecxCxSpMiddle"">With over 250 members, Tingathe’s central membership consists of approximately 150 secondary school students, 60 primary school students, and a local women's forum of 40 women who have partnered with us in order to help deliver educational services. Tingathe strongly believes in a subsidiary-oriented approach wherein those who will be most affected by decisions have a proportional role in the decision-making process.</p>
<p class=""ecxCxSpMiddle"">The Initiative's four core areas of focus are: basic primary and secondary education, vocational skills training for those hoping to enter the workforce, HIV/AIDS awareness and support, and environmental sustainability programs. In addition to these current projects, Tingathe holds enormous potential to develop new endeavors in response to dynamic community needs.</p>
<p class=""ecxCxSpMiddle"">Tingathe has both a Malawian and Canadian team. We believe that the project needs to be very much Malawian run with any decisions made based directly on the needs and wants of the community in Chinsapo. At the moment we are registered as a Community-Youth Organization in Malawi and are looking to become registered as an NGO in Malawi as well. In Canada we are running fundraisers to raise money to be able to sustain and expand Tingathe, and in August two of our Canadian team members will be going to Chinsapo to participate on the ground level and initiate new programs like a community garden, the expansion of our classrooms, support groups for HIV-affected individuals as well as sports, music and arts programs.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>What We Need:</p>
<p>The $3500 that we're hoping to raise through Indiegogo is going to be a huge contribution towards our larger budget of $10,000. This money will be put towards:</p>
<p>-at least one textbook for all grades in the Malawian curriculum</p>
<p>-learning supplies such as pens and paper for the students, blackboards and chalk for the teachers</p>
<p>-a computer for the center for both administrative purposes and to teach basic vocational skills to young adults</p>
<p>-a small salary to recompense our Malawian volunteer teachers</p>
<p>-building supplies to help expand our center</p>
<p>-sports equipment to start up extra curricular sports leagues</p>
<p>-solar panels to bring consistent electricity to our center and the community</p>
<p>-gardening tools and seeds for our community garden initiative to provide HIV+ individuals with proper nutrition and to encourage agricultural sustainability practices</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we don't reach our entire goal our focus will be on our educational center and the supplies (textbooks, pens and papers) needed to sustain and expand it. Our other priority will be recompensing our volunteer teachers who have been generously giving time that they cannot afford to be donating. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>What You Get:</p>
<p>Any size donation - We will put your name under a big Thank You on the partners page of our website. </p>
<p>$25 - We will personally call you to thank you. </p>
<p>$50- In addition to the above, we will send you a thank you card with current photos of the center. </p>
<p>$100- In addition to the above, you will be invited to a Thank You dinner held by the Tingathe Initiative in mid-June. </p>
<p>$250- In addition to the above, you will be invited to the Launch-Off party for some of our Canadian members going to Malawi in mid-August. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your impact will be huge! The Tingathe Initiative is attempting to provide students and young people with services that would otherwise be unavailable to them. Because Chinsapo is technically an ""area"" of Lilongwe (and the poorest one at that), there are no educational services set up there. However, it is not close enough to Lilongwe to allow potential students to commute to school and back in a day in time to also work which they must do to help support their families.</p>
<p>The Tingathe Initiative offers daily classes from 6-9am directly in Chinsapo to allow students to access education within their community. This accomodates the necessity of their working schedule and allows them to continue living with their families rather than having to leave to Lilongwe for education.  </p>
<p>Our organization is small: we are all volunteers and recieve no salary, we have no administrative costs and we know, care about and work directly with the students this is impacting. That means your impact can be enormous! You give directly to the cause for education, with tangible and transparent results. </p>
<p>Our team has a diverse background of experiences in international development. Chris Cameron, our founding member, has worked on the ground in Chinsapo as the programs coordinator for the Rainbow Home-Based Care Center which provides support to HIV-affected individuals and families. Samantha Lacourse, one of our managers, has also worked in Malawi for the World University Services of Canada as the program assistant for their Student Refugee Program. Lewis Grandinetti is a founder of the International Literacy Foundation and has set up libraries in Kenya, Pakistan and Hamilton, Ontario. My own experience is in ensuring the sustainability of non-profit organizations which I have done as the executive director of the Inuvik Homeless Shelter in the Northwest Territories. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We recognize that not everyone can make a monetary donation but there are tons of ways you can help us out!</p>
<p>Help spread awareness about the Tingathe Initiative. Like us on Facebook, follow us on Twitter and use the Sharetool on Indiegogo to bring us to the attention of your friends!</p>
<p>We are looking to hold fundraisers. If you have a fundraising idea or a venue that we can use for a fundraiser please don't be shy to get in touch with us!</p>
<p>We're looking for information and knowledge. If you have experience, say setting up a community garden, that you think we may benefit from please share with us!</p>
<p>We're looking for used book and sports equipment to send to Malawi and also help in covering shipping costs.</p>
<p>Finally, we're looking to meet likeminded people interested in making a difference in the world. Interested in traveling? Come volunteer for us in Malawi! There are tons of ways you can make a difference tailored to your interests. Want to make an impact closer to home? Get in touch with your ideas and see how you can help out our Canadian team!</p>

The $3500 that we're hoping to raise through Indiegogo is going to be a huge contribution towards our larger budget of $10,000. This money will be put towards:
-at least one textbook for all grades in the Malawian curriculum
-learning supplies such as pens and paper for the students, blackboards and chalk for the teachers
-a computer for the center for both administrative purposes and to teach basic vocational skills to young adults
-a small salary to recompense our Malawian volunteer teachers
-building supplies to help expand our center
-sports equipment to start up extra curricular sports leagues
-solar panels to bring consistent electricity to our center and the community
-gardening tools and seeds for our community garden initiative to provide HIV+ individuals with proper nutrition and to encourage agricultural sustainability practices
 
If we don't reach our entire goal our focus will be on our educational center and the supplies (textbooks, pens and papers) needed to sustain and expand it. Our other priority will be recompensing our volunteer teachers who have been generously giving time that they cannot afford to be donating. 
 
What You Get:
Any size donation - We will put your name under a big Thank You on the partners page of our website. 
$25 - We will personally call you to thank you. 
$50- In addition to the above, we will send you a thank you card with current photos of the center. 
$100- In addition to the above, you will be invited to a Thank You dinner held by the Tingathe Initiative in mid-June. 
$250- In addition to the above, you will be invited to the Launch-Off party for some of our Canadian members going to Malawi in mid-August. 


 
The Impact
Your impact will be huge! The Tingathe Initiative is attempting to provide students and young people with services that would otherwise be unavailable to them. Because Chinsapo is technically an ""area"" of Lilongwe (and the poorest one at that), there are no educational services set up there. However, it is not close enough to Lilongwe to allow potential students to commute to school and back in a day in time to also work which they must do to help support their families.
The Tingathe Initiative offers daily classes from 6-9am directly in Chinsapo to allow students to access education within their community. This accomodates the necessity of their working schedule and allows them to continue living with their families rather than having to leave to Lilongwe for education.  
Our organization is small: we are all volunteers and recieve no salary, we have no administrative costs and we know, care about and work directly with the students this is impacting. That means your impact can be enormous! You give directly to the cause for education, with tangible and transparent results. 
Our team has a diverse background of experiences in international development. Chris Cameron, our founding member, has worked on the ground in Chinsapo as the programs coordinator for the Rainbow Home-Based Care Center which provides support to HIV-affected individuals and families. Samantha Lacourse, one of our managers, has also worked in Malawi for the World University Services of Canada as the program assistant for their Student Refugee Program. Lewis Grandinetti is a founder of the International Literacy Foundation and has set up libraries in Kenya, Pakistan and Hamilton, Ontario. My own experience is in ensuring the sustainability of non-profit organizations which I have done as the executive director of the Inuvik Homeless Shelter in the Northwest Territories.

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>As you know, Dr. Larry Witmer is a phenomenal paleontologist. He's given so much to paleo. Perhaps it's time for us to give something back. Larry is ""strongly protanomolous,"" which means he's badly colorblind. In paleo, the ability to see color is essential for visualizing reconstructed soft-tissues, something that is near and dear to Larry's work. Larry is a trooper, and he's accommodated for his colorblindness thus far. However, having color vision would enrich his life and his work. There are special glasses (<a href=""http://enchroma.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://enchroma.com/</a>) that can correct colorblindness, but they're expensive ($650, including fees). Please consider making a contribution today to help Larry see in full color! It would make a wonderful Christmas present!</p>
<p> Thanks!</p>
<p>Ashley Morhardt </p>
<p>P.S. Larry has no clue about this campaign, but he will soon! :) </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>I have been working with families affected by Autism and other learning differences since 2000 in the panhandle and in South Florida.  I currently work privately with 6 families and have been with most of my families for 4+ years.  The therapy services that I provide are Applied Behavior Analysis, Verbal Behavior, life skills training, academic tutoring, and parent training.  With the astounding increase in Autism Spectrum Disorder cases over the last 6 years (rates have doubled to 1 in 50 children), there is an increased demand for therapeutic services and early intervention.  Not wanting to compromise the quality of the services which I provide, I keep my case load small and am loyal to my current families.  In some cases, there are children who would greatly benefit from additional therapies or an increase in therapy hours but it can be cost prohibitive. In addition to several types of therapies, families also pay for extracurricular activites, extra medical costs (in some cases), and specialized child care.  Families soon find that a large majority of their family income is spent on these types of therapeutic, educational, and medical costs.  With this campaign, I am going to raise enough money to provide, for 2 families, 3 additional hours of therapy per week for 1 year and $2000 cash for each family to use towards educational, medical, or therapy costs.  If I exceed my goal, I will seek out a new family who cannot afford services and will offer the overage to them in the form of a scholarship.</p>
<p><strong>If the contributions meet the goal ($20,000), the actual amount received will be $18,100 from indiegogo.com after the fees are collected by the site.  $4000 will be given as cash gifts to the families which leaves $7,100 for therapy expenses (materials, etc.).  This is about $48.00 per hour, 20% less than the actual cost.  The remaining 20% will be contributed by me.</strong></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>In order to do this, the goal is $20,000.  This amount will cover 3 hours of therapy per week, per family, and $2000 cash for each family to spend on medical, therapeutic or educational expenses for their child.  If the goal is not met, the scholarship will be scaled down to provide as much assistance as possible.  For your contribution, you will receive an update about the progress of the scholarship program (hopefully I can continue it beyond 1 year and for different families in need) and will have my undying gratitude for paying it forward and helping me to pay it forward.</p>

<h3>The Pitch</h3>
<p>Rideau High School is located in Ottawa, Ontario. We are a school of 550 students. We have a very diverse population with students from all over the world. We have the largest ELD/ESL population in our school board and the largest Aboriginal population. This diversity is our strength and many of our students use the word ""family"" to describe how they feel about Rideau.</p>
<p>We are not a wealthy school. The average household income at Rideau is just over $39,000. In the city of Ottawa, the average is $96,000. Many of our students do not have the resources to purchase their own laptops or tablets to use in school. It is also a challenge to fundraise to purchase technology resources. Our computers are getting old and students are often frustrated with the lack of speed and computing power available to them.</p>
<p>We want to give our students access to technology that will help them in school and prepare them for work and future studies.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>We would like to purchase a class set of 30 Chrome Books and a charging cart. The Chrome Books would be available in the library for students to sign out for the day or for teachers to sign out for their class.</p>

<div>
<p>Chrome Books are fast and reliable. They start up in seconds and connect students to a plethora of web based apps that sync with their Google Apps accounts. Student work is created and saved to the cloud. They can access their work from any device, any where, any time.</p>
<p>Our current computers, in some cases, take over 10 minutes to start up and open a browser. They regularly crash and frustrate students and staff alike. Access to chrome books will help students become more familiar with technology that will become an essential part of their future education and careers.</p>

<h3>Who We Are </h3>
<p>We are a team of 6 undergraduate students and 1 doctoral candidate at Kansas State University.  Near the end of last semester we began to put together a once in a lifetime opportunity to expand upon our education by spending a summer in Uganda conducting hands-on research and performing community service as a member of the International Service Teams (IST) at Kansas State University.</p>
<p>IST is a service-learning program of interdisciplinary teams of KSU students who serve in communities around the world.  Over the past 21 years, IST has served in communities in Brazil, Kenya, Mexico, and South Africa, through the development of service-learning initiatives based on specific community needs.  </p>
<p>While service learning has historically been a portion of the IST program, we are the first team to incorporate a research component to our trip.  This is not only a benefit to our team, but it is also pushing the expansion of the IST program to provide future Kansas State students real-world research experience.  </p>

<p>For nearly 20 years Joseph Kony and the Lord's Resistence Army terrorized Uganda.  In 2006, attacks within Uganda ended and the country has since seen nearly 7 years of peace.  At the height of the attacks, it is estimated that nearly 90% of northern Ugandans were internally displaced.  Those who had the resources and ability fled, many to Kampala in the south.  However, an estimated 1.8 million people were not as fortunate and called an Internally Displaced Person (IDP) camp home.  </p>
<p>Since 2007 the victims of the LRA's reign of terror have been returning home to pick up the pieces and rebuild their lives.  Despite the end of attrocities inside of Uganda nearly 6 years prior, the Kony 2012 movement drew tremendous newfound attention to the region.  This attention has led to numerous developments on the national and international level.  Billions of dollars in aid and military soldiers have found their way into east Africa to track down Joseph Kony and bring him to justice.</p>
<p>During a recent trip to Uganda to set up contacts at Makerere University, M-Lisada orphanage, and Bead for Life, we learned that many Ugandans do not view the influx of attention favorably.  In fact, many people we talked to were confused as to why this conflict, years after attrocities have ended, is the one that has garnered attention.  </p>
<p>When we began delving deeper into their views, we learned that the campaign is largely missing historical and cultural context.  We also learned (after listening to hours of life-stories) that everyone has a story.  </p>
<p>What is their story?  How do they view the recent influx of attention?  What do they see as important in their daily lives?  Where do they think international attention should be drawn?  </p>
<p>Ugandans are not ""voiceless"" (as they are often portrayed).  But, in many cases, they do lack ability to be heard.  We hope to provide that conduit. </p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>A 10 week trip to Uganda for 7 college students is not cheap.  For airfare, in country transportation, housing, and basic necessities, we are in search of about $28,000 ($4,000 per person).    </p>
<p>In addition to asking family and friends, we have applied for several grants/scholarships and have planned numerous fundraising events.</p>
<p>Without funding, there are some in our group who may not be able to travel.  That is why we are here at Indiegogo asking for your support.  :) </p>
<p>In sociology we like to use the phrase, ""become an outsider, within.""  In that spirit, we will actually live with families who have been directly and indirectly impacted by LRA activities.  This does two things.  First, it brings funds and support to some of the poorest families in the world rather than a hotel.  Second, it keeps our cost as low as possible.</p>
<p>We are not in this to make a profit.  If we are fortunate enough to fully fund our travel, all additional money will be donated to M-Lisada orphanage in Kampala, Uganda and Bead for Life.</p>

<p>  </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are currently enrolled in a Leadership Studies course where we are learning about international travel, Ugandan history, language skills, and advanced research methods.  This summer we will travel to Uganda and put these newly learned skills to use by conducting qualitative interviews with families who have been directly impacted by the Lord’s Resistance Army (a rebel group who abducted children nearly a decade ago).  For this portion of the project we are partnering with Makerere University (the largest and oldest University in Uganda) and Bead for Life, a poverty alleviation group that teaches highly impoverished women how to make beads, and shea butter products, provides entrepreneurial training, and in some cases provides housing.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>In addition, we will spend about half of the summer partnering with M-Lisada orphanage.  M-Lisada helps orphans by providing them with a place to stay, helping them become educated, and teaching them life skills.  While there we will assist with planting trees, painting their house, teaching the children, aiding the administration, and working with the children as they spend time cleaning the nearby community (Katwe slum).</p>

Ugandans are not ""voiceless"" (as they are often portrayed).  But, in many cases, they do lack ability to be heard.  We hope to provide that conduit. 
 


What We Need 
A 10 week trip to Uganda for 7 college students is not cheap.  For airfare, in country transportation, housing, and basic necessities, we are in search of about $28,000 ($4,000 per person).    
In addition to asking family and friends, we have applied for several grants/scholarships and have planned numerous fundraising events.
Without funding, there are some in our group who may not be able to travel.  That is why we are here at Indiegogo asking for your support.  :) 
In sociology we like to use the phrase, ""become an outsider, within.""  In that spirit, we will actually live with families who have been directly and indirectly impacted by LRA activities.  This does two things.  First, it brings funds and support to some of the poorest families in the world rather than a hotel.  Second, it keeps our cost as low as possible.
We are not in this to make a profit.  If we are fortunate enough to fully fund our travel, all additional money will be donated to M-Lisada orphanage in Kampala, Uganda and Bead for Life.

The Impact
We are currently enrolled in a Leadership Studies course where we are learning about international travel, Ugandan history, language skills, and advanced research methods.  This summer we will travel to Uganda and put these newly learned skills to use by conducting qualitative interviews with families who have been directly impacted by the Lord’s Resistance Army (a rebel group who abducted children nearly a decade ago).  For this portion of the project we are partnering with Makerere University (the largest and oldest University in Uganda) and Bead for Life, a poverty alleviation group that teaches highly impoverished women how to make beads, and shea butter products, provides entrepreneurial training, and in some cases provides housing.  
 
In addition, we will spend about half of the summer partnering with M-Lisada orphanage.  M-Lisada helps orphans by providing them with a place to stay, helping them become educated, and teaching them life skills.  While there we will assist with planting trees, painting their house, teaching the children, aiding the administration, and working with the children as they spend time cleaning the nearby community (Katwe slum).

______________________________________________________________________What
is MAP the Pursuit? 
MAP stands for Mastery, Autonomy and
Purpose.  These are the three ingredients
for intrinsic motivation.  


Mastery = the process of getting
     better at a skill every time you practice it.

Autonomy =
     the power and freedom to make decisions about your  own life.

Purpose =
     the connection of what you do to something meaningful in your life.

When students exercise Mastery,
Autonomy and Purpose, they learn on their own without being forced or bribed to do it.  Self-directed learning is not pie-in-the-sky optimism. It
is based on scientific understandings of neurology and psychology and practical, real world experience by leaders such as Sugata Mitra, Daniel Pink, Charles Tsai, Mihaly Csikszentmihaly, Peter Gray, Elliot Washor, Dennis Littky, John Taylor Gatto and many others.   People all over the world are creating learning environments based on the
science of human motivation.  We want one, too, for our children and our
community.
And the “Pursuit” part of our name?  It’s the pursuit of happiness, of
course.  With MAP, any young person can pursue his or her own happiness. ......Outcomes: Self-directed Learners Go to
College… And Beyond

There is clear evidence that
self-directed learners of all stripes, including homeschoolers, unschoolers,

fulfilling lives:



Colleges everywhere have routes to

of the 11 universities that belong to the Colleges of Worcester Consortium, including
Worcester Polytechnic Institute, provide on their websites admission information
for self-directed learners, and 4 of the others responded positively to email
inquiries about applications from all kinds of self-directed learners.


The admissions page on Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s
website states, “MIT has a long history of admitting homeschooled students,
and these students are successful and vibrant members of our community.""


In a report written by Peter Gray, PhD, of
Boston College, on a survey of adults
who had been self-directed learners, 83% enrolled in higher education,
including graduate school beyond a 4 year degree.  The “participants reported remarkably little
difficulty academically in college… Students who had never previously been in a classroom or read a
textbook found themselves getting straight A’s and earning honors, both in
community college courses and in bachelor’s programs…”  A link to
the first of 4 reports on this survey by Peter Gray, PhD, of Boston College,
can be found in our Comments section.


As far back as 1994, the Wall Street
Journal reported, “Many colleges now routinely accept homeschooled students, who
typically present portfolios of their work instead of transcripts. Each year Harvard
University takes up to 10 applicants who have had some
homeschooling.


Organizations all over North America that

increase of 170% in 12 years.  This
indicates an increasing interest in alternatives to traditional school among the most
highly educated parents in the country.


The benefits of
self-directed learning seem to go beyond academic benefits.  A
graduate thesis by Roya J. Dedeaux at California State University, Long Beach, based
on a study of 1,052 participants, concludes “The results indicated that several
common assumptions about the homeschool culture are inaccurate, that
homeschoolers as a group are well below clinical cut-off scores for anxiety and

3. $3,500 (or any amount above or below that) will go directly to funding self-directed learning experiences designed entirely by and for young people. Let's Challenge the Status QuoOur long term plans also include campaigns to challenge the injustice of traditional schooling.  We believe we can help young people achieve academic success at HALF the cost that traditional public schools pay per student per year.  Districts in Massachusetts spend between $10,000 and $30,000 per pupil per year.  We can begin helping young people achieve their potential for about $6,000 per learner per year.  We have a long-term financial strategy that will challenge the establishment to rethink how self-directed learning can actually SAVE cities and towns hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.  This Indiegogo campaign is the first step in our long-term strategy.  We will build our organization one student at a time.  We will start by offering funding to students who design their own self-directed learning projects. We will use their success to market our organization and increase our fundraising strategy through grants and donations.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Visit North Star's website to see what kids in central Massachusetts can have:Self-directed Learning for Teens ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Other

<h3>Early Years</h3>
<p>So I have been drawing since I can remember, and so I knew it was something I wanted to do professionally even at a young age. I have been pursuing this goal of being an art professional all my life, and this is another step in that direction for me. </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>I need the moolah to get me to Canada. You get personalized art! </h3>
<p>When all is said and done I need about 5k to get to the Imaginism workshop held in Canada. It's a month long ordeal of intense concept art learning, and it's super exciting! BUT! I do not expect ALL of that moolah from you lovely people. All I am asking for is $2500. Added to what I am earning on my own, that should be more than enough to get me where I am going!</p>
<p>Now on to YOU! Most of my prizes have to do with original art for you, created by me. From a simple sketch to a fully rendered piece of art, it's all custom made by me, and tailored to exactly what you want. But the big cahuna, the Piez-de-resistaunce, is the $1000 perk. You donate 1000 bucks, I will create a large scale fully rendered crazy-insane painting, printed and mounted on foam core, shipped right to your door. But the best part- When I get back from Imaginism, I will either re-create the same piece, or create a brand new one with my newly developed skills from the workshop!</p>
<p>So double prize with that one! Go you! :)</p>
<div>
<h3>What it means to me...</h3>
<p>This is something I have dreamed of doing since I first heard of it when I first got into Art college. It's hard to explain to most people, but just the simple act of being able to LIVE with the artist who is teaching me, and getting real, hands-on, one-on-one teaching in a group of 4 people is just an astounding opportunity that I cannot pass up. Especially as an artist I get to really ask the questions I want to, and have them answered, and answered well from one bad-a$$ artist! (pardon my french :D)</p>
<p>I have been to school, and gotten the basics, but now I want to specialize and really find out how much better of an artist I can become. This would give me that opportunity, and more! </p>
<h3>Why Imaginism rocks!</h3>
<p>If you are reading all of this and don't have a clue about Imaginism studios, check out this link <a href=""http://www.imaginismstudios.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.imaginismstudios.com/</a></p>
<p>They are an awesome pre-production focused company that has produced some fantastic artwork for blockbuster films such as Alice in Wonderland, MIB3, and more. As well as having film credits, they create plenty of independant artwork, while also delving into children books and other interesting artistic endeavors. They are also the creators of Schoolism, an online school where people can learn techniques from masters in their respective fields. They know what they are doing! </p>
<p>And almost as an upgrade from Schoolism, is this workshop! <a href=""http://www.imaginismstudios.com/workshop.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.imaginismstudios.com/workshop.php</a> Heres a link if you want to check it out even more. Instead of getting only online feedback through schoolism, I'd have real life human interaction to learn and perfect my craft while there. Out of the (possibly) hundreds of applicants to their workshop, only 4 people are chosen. 4! And I was one of those chosen! So you can see how awesome and unique this opportunity is!

What remains is threatened by neglect, vandalism, natural disasters, and the ravages of time.These threats are real. The National Museum has closed; other museums, libraries, and cultural institutions are teetering on the brink, starved of funding with little or no prospect of keeping them operational. Old materials deteriorate under poor conditions. The threats of natural catastrophes and mob violence simply make matters worse.In 2014 alone, these threats struck twice. In February, rioters set fire to centuries-old documents in the State Presidency archives. In May, unprecedented flooding and landslides damaged or destroyed old documents and official records throughout the country. And the dangers are only growing.To combat these threats, the Foundation for the Preservation of Historical Heritage (FPHH) began digitizing rare holdings of the National Library in January 2014. In August 2014 it expanded its program to include the Historical Museum, along with Oslobodjenje, the country’s oldest continuously published daily newspaper.

<p>Hello Indigogo!</p>
<p>This is the Los Angeles Robotics &amp; Aeronautics Learning Club. We would like to get a 3D printer &amp; bench drill press 
to use for enhancing our education, and hosting workshops at for students and  local Boy Scouts of America Troops. We are passionate about education, and we 
believe this project has a great potential to positively impact our 
community.</p>
<p>Our future is important to us, and we believe that inspiring the 
youth will make this world a better place. If we do not reach our goal, 
we will still pursue a 3D printer, but of less quality. If we exceed our
 goals, then we can invest in a higher quality printer, the materials 
that we will need for it, and be able to do more frequent projects in 
the community. Please visit our Facebook page and spread the word!</p>

Although our visit was as short as only one morning these kids stole my heart. <br/>As this was my first time of actual visiting a home of under privileged children I was afraid that there would be a gap of mutual understanding. I was a ''white tall strange girl'' and they lived in a world far different from mine. And god knows what these little souls have been through in their short lives. Who was I to step in just as briefly as I did and then disappear again, and who knows maybe never return? What could I contribute in just a few hours without being an intruder or even worse, a tourist?</p><p>I was happy that we didn't come empty handed as my colleagues were prepared and been before. We had a very warm welcome by Mr. Chepas the founder and two Danish girls who were volunteering for their second summer. They told us their story obout New Life. As it turned out I was already more connected with this special little place as I had initially thought. Not only did my mom use to have her own maternity agency with the same name, New Life. It also turned out that Mr. Chepas had lived in Holland for 14yrs before he decided to come back to his homeland and founded the orphanage. </p><p>After a little tour inside and outside the orphanage, we went 'next doors' to the school that not only held the 46 New Life kids but the other children from the town as well. The kids were just finishing up their tests which meant we came in on the right moment, play time! </p><p>We went to different classrooms of different grades and introduced ourselves. We made little chats with the kids, asking about how they did on their tests and their favorite school subjects. Soon all kids started to come out of the classrooms around and we had a hallway full of running, clapping, dancing and laughing little people. Outside some of the older kids were playing soccer and girls where teaching each other to dance. <br/>As I watched them play and played with them I felt all barriers breaking down. These were the same kids like I know how kids are from back home and from a places I've been around the world: Curious, energetic, happy and cheeky kids. And just like kids can be, some of them were shy; others grabbed my hand and my skirt and longed for a hug or a pat on the head. These kids are just like the kids you and I once were and the kids we know today from friends and family or the ones we see at the playground near our house. And I realized this is what being a kid is all about: being able to be a kid in every sense of the way. To be able to play, laugh and learn and to be able to love and be loved in return without fear, stress or sorrow. The only thing what makes these kids just a little different from the rest is the way we see them. What we see is what they don't have or as I would like to say, what we see is what can be better. That they can have better, in terms of food, health, sanitary and education. And this is where I felt I CAN make a difference, even if it is a small one. The fact that these kids crossed my path meant that I could choose to walk out of their lives and never return to anything less than a cherished memory. OR I could come back once more and this time to bring more than just my smile and love. This time I could come back and actually contribute to their lives and make it a little better. </p><p>When I left I didn't know when exactly I would be able to return and in what way. But I knew I would one day. And as if the universe couldn't have planned a more symbolic time for me to return I will be going back to Accra, Ghana for two days during Christmas. For me it is a sign that this is my chance, to realize my Christmas thought to make a difference. </p><p>And yes, this is the point where I want to ask you to help and share in my Christmas thought and help me make a small contribution to the life of these children. Who are, in plane words, in need of school supplies, sanitary improvements and expanding of living space. During my visit I learned that they just put up a brick wall to create a safe surrounding for the schools courtyard. This had cost all the $1000 raised by the volunteer girls in their home country Denmark. So I thought if they can do that so can I! </p><p>I only have 20days left (as it is) and might not have a marathon to run or a talent that I can exploit. But I can share this story which I know will reach all of my new and old connections from all over the world who all have an incredible strong network of their own. And I know how much holidays are always about togetherness, family and sharing love. As well as it is a moment when we count our blessings and are more aware of the less fortunate in this world. Around this time we donate a little more here and there to the man with the violin in the metro or at the occasional visit to the church. </p><p>Let me make it easy for you: By not making you feel obliged to make a random donation to clear your conscience and share the Christmas spirit. But let ME make YOU part of a small but very real story. And help make a genuine difference in the life of 46+ happy, full of life children, who have been given a New Life and a better future. Will you help me make it even a little better?</p><p>Every gesture small or big would be highly appreciated and the total amount will be delivered in hand on the 24/25th of Dec. to Mr. Chepas by me.</p><p>And I promise that I will tell you afterwards what direct effect your donation has made on the life of these beautiful children and their amazing care takers. I am even planning another and longer visit next year when I get the chance. And maybe actually be able to help put the money to use or contribute more in physical presence. In any way your money will go directly to the cause instead of to some promising organisation. </p><p>Share the love and this story and I can assure you that not only I but above all the New Life kids in Ghana will be ever so grateful to you!!</p></div>","Four months ago I got introduced to the New Life Orphanage in Ghana by a colleague of mine.

<p>MILECHILD Foundation is a community based, local
non-profit organisation passionately supporting children in schools,
orphanages, families and communities. The organisation was founded by Martin
Mubiru, who was born just a few kilometres away of the village Kabale Lutete
Kisoso, where the nursery school is located. The living conditions in the
Lutete Kisoso village, where the school is located, are still very poor. Nearly
all of the villagers live on farming and subsistence agriculture. The monthly income of a whole family is
between 7.7 US$ to 38.5 US$. Obviously, many families can’t even afford health
care or school fees, what we consider in Europe as basics. The vision of
MILECHILD is to offer these financially underprivileged children a good
education and a safe place, far away from the problems many children face at
home. We believe that a good education is the best condition for improving
their situation in the future. The school is run by four local teachers and
helpers. The project is funded by donators from around the world and by many
volunteers who work for free to fight poverty. Check out our website for more

<p>Martin, the local leader of the organisation, has already identified the issue and started to build a new, bigger school. In the end, the new school building shall include
three classrooms, what will allow separate classrooms for children of different
ages and thus different education levels. By the hard work of Martin, many
volunteers, local workers and the financial support of both international and
local donators, one classroom has already been finished within the last year.
This is one big step in the right direction, but there is still a need for at
least a second classroom to further relax the situation.</p>
<p>The second classroom is really, really necessary to
provide the children with a beautiful and safe environment. Our goal is to let
them feel that they are not always on the poor side of life and worth visiting
such a school. Since MILECHILD Foundation is currently struggling to raise
enough money for being able to finish the second classroom, your contribution
for a blackboard, softboards, tiles, windows, a door and paint would be a huge
step forward for this project. Our current aim is to raise 1000 US Dollar, what
will enable us to start with the work. All in all, an amount of approximately
3000 US Dollar is necessary in order to totally finish the work on the
classroom.</p>

eine lokale, gemeindebasierte und gemeinnützige Organisation und somit im Gegensatz

wurde nur wenige Kilometer von Kabale Lutete Kisoso, wo sich die Nursery School

sehr schlecht. Nahezu alle Dorfbewohner leben als Bauern und damit vor allem
von der Subsistenzwirtschaft (sie leben also von ihren eigenen Erzeugnissen).
Das durchschnittliche Monatseinkommen einer gesamten Familie liegt zwischen 7,7

selbstverständlich sind, nicht selbst bezahlen können. Die Vision von Milechild
ist es, finanziell benachteiligten Kindern eine gute Bildung und einen sicheren
Ort zu bieten, weit weg von den Problemen, denen die Kinder zu Hause ausgesetzt
sind. Wir sind davon überzeugt, dass eine gute Schulbildung die beste
Voraussetzung ist, die Lebenssituation der Kinder und Gemeinde in Zukunft zu
verbessern. In der Schule arbeiten zwei lokale Lehrerinnen und zwei
Unterstützerinnen von diesen. Finanziert wird das Projekt von Spendern und
anderen Unterstützern weltweit und vielen Voluntären, die unbezahlt an ihrem

drei Klassenräume enthalten. Dies erlaubt es, Kinder verschiedenen Alters und
verschiedener Bildungslevel getrennt voneinander zu unterrichten. Durch die
harte Arbeit von Martin, vielen Freiwilligen und der Unterstützung von sowohl
nationalen als auch internationalen Spendern konnte ein Klassenzimmer im Laufe

ist wirklich notwendig, um den Kinder tatsächlich eine schöne und sichere

damit zu kämpfen hat, genug Geld für die Fertigstellung des zweiten

I hail from an old religious lineage called Ngoe lineage of which the famous Tibetan saint Pema Lingpa also was a descendant. All my life I have been passionate about Buddhism in all its facets and particularly about Buddhist philosophy. Finally, my dream has come true when I was offered a place at the University of Hamburg to pursue a Master of Arts in Tibetan Studies. You can find my acceptance letter in the image galery. It has always been my dream to study Tibetology particularly with Prof. Dorji Wangchuk, who is originally from Bhutan and one of the most eminent scholars in the field: </p><p><a href=""http://www.kc-tbts.uni-hamburg.de/index.php/startseite/46-cvs/60-dorji-wangchuk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.kc-tbts.uni-hamburg.de/index.php/startseite/46-cvs/60-dorji-wangchuk</a></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">I am determined and very passionate about gaining knowledge in Buddhist studies from an Academic perspective. I have everything I need to study... except the financial requirements.  </span></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3><ul>
<li>I need to produce at least 8000 EUR on a German blocked bank account to get my visa to Germany and to commence my studies in October 2014</li>
<li>The sole purpose of the 8000 EUR will be for living expenses, health insurance, transport and student fees in my first year of studies</li>
<li>While in Germany I can apply for funding for my second year which I am confident to secure but first I have to get there</li>
<li>To be honest: it is difficult for me as a young Bhutanese student to offer you much in return but I am sure that you will gain a lot of merit by supporting me. Also I will set up a blog or website where you can follow my progress and keep in touch.</li>
<li>Furthermore I will try my best to send a letter of thanks enclosing a small gift from Bhutan </li>
</ul><p></p><p></p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>If I get to go and study Tibetology at Hamburg University it would be a breakthrough for Bhutanese women who would like to become Buddhist scholars but are not nurtured in their aspiration in a country where males have been favored in such a field. But not only that. It will also proof to young women in general that it is worthwhile pursuing your dream - even as a young woman - and that there is a real chance to achieve what you dream to become for yourself. I hope to become an example for young women of humble background.  </p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Furthermore, if I pursue my studies in Tibetology at Hamburg University, it will have a major impact on the textual research community in Bhutan because as of now there are not much textual scholars in Bhutan who possess the tools and methods of a Western Academic approach. I would love to contribute to the work of the Khentse Center for Tibetan Buddhist Textual Scholarship in the future: </span><a href=""http://www.kc-tbts.uni-hamburg.de/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;"">http://www.kc-tbts.uni-hamburg.de/</a><br/></p><p><span style=""font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px;"">Other Ways You Can Help</span><br/></p><p>I am deeply grateful for any contribution.

I am 23 years old and from Sumthrang, a village in Central Bhutan. I hail from an old religious lineage called Ngoe lineage of which the famous Tibetan saint Pema Lingpa also was a descendant. All my life I have been passionate about Buddhism in all its facets and particularly about Buddhist philosophy. Finally, my dream has come true when I was offered a place at the University of Hamburg to pursue a Master of Arts in Tibetan Studies. You can find my acceptance letter in the image galery. It has always been my dream to study Tibetology particularly with Prof. Dorji Wangchuk, who is originally from Bhutan and one of the most eminent scholars in the field: http://www.kc-tbts.uni-hamburg.de/index.php/startseite/46-cvs/60-dorji-wangchukI am determined and very passionate about gaining knowledge in Buddhist studies from an Academic perspective. I have everything I need to study... except the financial requirements.  What I Need & What You Get
I need to produce at least 8000 EUR on a German blocked bank account to get my visa to Germany and to commence my studies in October 2014
The sole purpose of the 8000 EUR will be for living expenses, health insurance, transport and student fees in my first year of studies
While in Germany I can apply for funding for my second year which I am confident to secure but first I have to get there
To be honest: it is difficult for me as a young Bhutanese student to offer you much in return but I am sure that you will gain a lot of merit by supporting me. Also I will set up a blog or website where you can follow my progress and keep in touch.
Furthermore I will try my best to send a letter of thanks enclosing a small gift from Bhutan 
The ImpactIf I get to go and study Tibetology at Hamburg University it would be a breakthrough for Bhutanese women who would like to become Buddhist scholars but are not nurtured in their aspiration in a country where males have been favored in such a field. But not only that. It will also proof to young women in general that it is worthwhile pursuing your dream - even as a young woman - and that there is a real chance to achieve what you dream to become for yourself. I hope to become an example for young women of humble background.  Furthermore, if I pursue my studies in Tibetology at Hamburg University, it will have a major impact on the textual research community in Bhutan because as of now there are not much textual scholars in Bhutan who possess the tools and methods of a Western Academic approach. I would love to contribute to the work of the Khentse Center for Tibetan Buddhist Textual Scholarship in the future: http://www.kc-tbts.uni-hamburg.de/Other Ways You Can HelpI am deeply grateful for any contribution.

My college experience has been incredibly transformative and has allowed me to discover my passion for the arts, and particularly, my desire to pursue an acting career in the upcoming years. In these past four years, I have worked with companies and artists throughout Europe, North and South America and the Middle East, acting in shows in Florence (Italy), New York City (USA), Santiago (Chile) and Abu Dhabi (UAE). As college comes to an end, I find myself asking about my role as an artist in telling stories, acting and making theater as well as what I want life to be. The future is uncertain, but also exciting due to some amazing opportunities that have come up in the last couple of months.<br/><br/>I have been invited to study this summer with Witness Relocation and Theater Mitu, two ground-breaking NYC-based theater companies.

<br/>
</div>
<div>I will partner with organisations, agencies and charities on the ground who will manage the requirements of the children and together we will assist in rebuilding the lives of these children - they are the adults of our future - when they receive nurture today - they will grow up to be nurturing adults - and will contribute to the stabilisation of their nation! </div>
<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>This is a reach out to you - to please help the folk who are at serious risk of dying of starvation and dehydration and are stranded on top of barren mountains in Iraq  as they escape certain death should they go down.</p>
<p><b>Relief helicopters have started evacuating some - but according to the Iraqi authorities it could take up to 500 days to remove the 50 000+ refugees at the current rate is evacuation - THEY WILL NOT LIVE THAT LONG!</b></p>
<p>The Iraqi authorities have reached out to the US and UK governments but as we all know it is August and holiday time -  and the leaders of both countries are on holiday - and whilst I appreciate they may have their respective fingers on the pulse - they will need to deliberate, discuss, negotiate (peerages etc) before anything gets done - in the meantime how many more people including young kids will die in agony???</p>
<p>There is a lot of debate and promises... but nothing concrete happening - and as we all know any assistance will undoubtedly have an element of political motivation (<a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2722610/How-desperate-Yazidis-throwing-relief-helicopters-Iraq-says-500-days-save-all.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here is a link to a report in today's dailymail</a>)</p>
<p><b>THIS IS NOT A POLITICALLY MOTIVATED CALL FOR ACITON</b> guys - this is me - an ordinary person who just can not stand by any longer and do nothing asking you to join me as ordinary folk in making a difference to the lives of as many as we can - even if it is just ONE PERSON..OR ONE CHILD!</p>
<p>There is so much strive and struggle all over the world at the moment and so many lives being lost - but this is something I think we can do something about...</p>
<p>We need to get aircraft over there  - AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE to get these stranded people out!</p>
<p>We need to supply them with water, food and medical supplies..</p>
<p><b>EVEN IF WE JUST SAVE THE LIFE ON 1 CHILD </b>- surely that is worth it??</p>
<p>I see on Facebook so many people making references to the conflict over Gaza - hundreds of comments from people saying - we can't stand by and let this happen - and yes I agree - but sometimes the solution is more challenging for ordinary folk like you and me - but in this case it is different - <b>YOU AND I CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE!</b></p>
<p>It is my wish and intention with this campaign to achieve two things -</p>
<p>1) Raise money to engage the services of providers who can fly in and rescue to stranded men, women and children.</p>
<p>2) Challenge (in the most respectful manner) those with the resources and social connections to rally in and engage their network in assisting this humanitarian cause.</p>
<p>Yesterday (11 August 2014) an amazing and gifted person left this planet - Robin Williams - he left a phenomenal legacy, the outpouring of sincere sorrow at his passing has been INCREDIBLE -  we all remember the pure joy he gave us and the wonderful belly laughs he allowed us - I recall watching him during the darkest years of my life - when I was incarcerated against my will, raped, beaten and shot over a period of almost 2 decades - but his shows Morc and Mindy were the highlights of my week and watching him was a tonic for my soul..... his legacy was the joy he brought to people - your legacy can be the lives you save of innocent children...</p>
<p>Robin Williams is quoted as saying <i><b>""No matter what people tell you words and ideas CAN CHANGE the world""</b></i></p>
<p>And he is right!  you and me can send a clear message that we will not stand by as our brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles are being slaughtered - and abandoned!</p>
<p>In doing so we will be saving the lives of many - the number of which depends on how much this campaign is supported!!</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>This call to action is unlike ANY other crowd fund campaign and is certainly going against everything I advise my clients on raising money with crowd funding..</p>
<p>I am launching this without any joint venture plans - without any strategy - other than to rely on millions of people who feel the same as I do about this!</p>
<p>Time is critical - we need to act quickly - lives are at high risk! </p>
<p>I have no rewards to offer - in fact I can not think of any at this stage - other than the pure soul felt compassion of knowing that you did something today to save the life of a child!</p>
<p>And hopefully at the end of the campaign more than a child but tens of thousands of people!</p>
<p>If you would love to recommend or suggest what could be offered as reward I am open to ideas!!</p>
<p>I also invite as much assistance as possible!! </p>
<p>I intend to raise enough money to engage the services of those that can proactively rescue those people stranded on top of the barren Mountain in Iraq and furthermore to supply them with immediate relief in the form of shelter - in whatever form that takes - food, water and medical supplies -<b> AS QUICK AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE!</b></p>
<p><b>And that depends on you - donating and sharing this campaign with your network as quickly as possible!</b></p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>You and I as ordinary folk going about our daily lives - comfortable with our daily challenges of making ends meat, or saving for annual holidays, or cramming in studies or experiencing hiccups in marriages, or naughty teens giving headaches... can not comprehend what desperation the men, women and children are experiencing as they languish on the mountain with no way of escaping alive! </p>
<p>It puts our stresses, worries, frustrations all into harsh perspective! </p>
<p>Donating even £10 and sharing and encouraging your network to match or better your donation has the collective potential to make a real difference to the lives of tens of thousands of people - so please do it!</p>
<p>I also urge you to send this link to your local media - to blog posts and online magazines... </p>

</div> <p>You and I can save the lives of tens of thousands of people with this simple campaign!  Thank you for taking the time to read this! Wishing you a blessed day, love and gratitude Judy.</p></div>","UPDATE ON CAMPAIGN -
Today 17 August there are many children who have managed to get to safety.. but they are in dire need of basic supplies..... they need safekeeping and protection - they are still at risk...
Please help me help those on the ground provide safekeeping for these children who deserve the love and nurturing that all children require. 

These children are at risk still - please contribute and let's do what is right and protect those that will be our leaders in the next generation! 
As of now Friday 15 August most of the people have been rescued off the mountain! There does remain a few thousand people stranded still.  But the situation is being dealt with!
There is still urgent requirement for assistance in this project!
There are thousands of children who have lost parents in the massacre during their escape to the mountain - The funds raised in this campaign will now be sued towards supporting these children.
Ensuring that they have their basic needs met, food, shelter, clothing and education.





I will partner with organisations, agencies and charities on the ground who will manage the requirements of the children and together we will assist in rebuilding the lives of these children - they are the adults of our future - when they receive nurture today - they will grow up to be nurturing adults - and will contribute to the stabilisation of their nation! 
Short Summary This is a reach out to you - to please help the folk who are at serious risk of dying of starvation and dehydration and are stranded on top of barren mountains in Iraq  as they escape certain death should they go down.
Relief helicopters have started evacuating some - but according to the Iraqi authorities it could take up to 500 days to remove the 50 000+ refugees at the current rate is evacuation - THEY WILL NOT LIVE THAT LONG!
The Iraqi authorities have reached out to the US and UK governments but as we all know it is August and holiday time -  and the leaders of both countries are on holiday - and whilst I appreciate they may have their respective fingers on the pulse - they will need to deliberate, discuss, negotiate (peerages etc) before anything gets done - in the meantime how many more people including young kids will die in agony???
There is a lot of debate and promises... but nothing concrete happening - and as we all know any assistance will undoubtedly have an element of political motivation (here is a link to a report in today's dailymail)
THIS IS NOT A POLITICALLY MOTIVATED CALL FOR ACITON guys - this is me - an ordinary person who just can not stand by any longer and do nothing asking you to join me as ordinary folk in making a difference to the lives of as many as we can - even if it is just ONE PERSON..OR ONE CHILD!
There is so much strive and struggle all over the world at the moment and so many lives being lost - but this is something I think we can do something about...
We need to get aircraft over there  - AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE to get these stranded people out!
We need to supply them with water, food and medical supplies..
EVEN IF WE JUST SAVE THE LIFE ON 1 CHILD - surely that is worth it??
I see on Facebook so many people making references to the conflict over Gaza - hundreds of comments from people saying - we can't stand by and let this happen - and yes I agree - but sometimes the solution is more challenging for ordinary folk like you and me - but in this case it is different - YOU AND I CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE!
It is my wish and intention with this campaign to achieve two things -
1) Raise money to engage the services of providers who can fly in and rescue to stranded men, women and children.
2) Challenge (in the most respectful manner) those with the resources and social connections to rally in and engage their network in assisting this humanitarian cause.
Yesterday (11 August 2014) an amazing and gifted person left this planet - Robin Williams - he left a phenomenal legacy, the outpouring of sincere sorrow at his passing has been INCREDIBLE -  we all remember the pure joy he gave us and the wonderful belly laughs he allowed us - I recall watching him during the darkest years of my life - when I was incarcerated against my will, raped, beaten and shot over a period of almost 2 decades - but his shows Morc and Mindy were the highlights of my week and watching him was a tonic for my soul..... his legacy was the joy he brought to people - your legacy can be the lives you save of innocent children...
Robin Williams is quoted as saying ""No matter what people tell you words and ideas CAN CHANGE the world""
And he is right!  you and me can send a clear message that we will not stand by as our brothers, sisters, mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles are being slaughtered - and abandoned!
In doing so we will be saving the lives of many - the number of which depends on how much this campaign is supported!!
   What We Need & What You Get This call to action is unlike ANY other crowd fund campaign and is certainly going against everything I advise my clients on raising money with crowd funding..
I am launching this without any joint venture plans - without any strategy - other than to rely on millions of people who feel the same as I do about this!
Time is critical - we need to act quickly - lives are at high risk! 
I have no rewards to offer - in fact I can not think of any at this stage - other than the pure soul felt compassion of knowing that you did something today to save the life of a child!
And hopefully at the end of the campaign more than a child but tens of thousands of people!
If you would love to recommend or suggest what could be offered as reward I am open to ideas!!
I also invite as much assistance as possible!! 
I intend to raise enough money to engage the services of those that can proactively rescue those people stranded on top of the barren Mountain in Iraq and furthermore to supply them with immediate relief in the form of shelter - in whatever form that takes - food, water and medical supplies - AS QUICK AS HUMANLY POSSIBLE!
And that depends on you - donating and sharing this campaign with your network as quickly as possible!


  The Impact You and I as ordinary folk going about our daily lives - comfortable with our daily challenges of making ends meat, or saving for annual holidays, or cramming in studies or experiencing hiccups in marriages, or naughty teens giving headaches... can not comprehend what desperation the men, women and children are experiencing as they languish on the mountain with no way of escaping alive! 
It puts our stresses, worries, frustrations all into harsh perspective! 
Donating even £10 and sharing and encouraging your network to match or better your donation has the collective potential to make a real difference to the lives of tens of thousands of people - so please do it!
I also urge you to send this link to your local media - to blog posts and online magazines... 

  Risks & Challenges I know that I can not make a difference on my own!  I can not promise that I will reach enough people in enough time to make a difference even to the life of 1 child!
I have no plan cast in stone as yet - I do not have helicopters on stand by - I do not have access to the likes of Richard Branson who amazed the world with his brave rescue mission many years ago sending in a Virgin Atlantic 747 to Iraq with much needed and valuable supplies here is the link with more info on that story. (courtesy of dailymail.co.uk) 
But I do know that with enough traction - enough support - enough awareness - this campaign can raise enough funds and engage the interest of many with phenomenal influence and resources so that collectively we can make a plan that is concrete - and more importantly - save the lives of thousands!! 
Look at what you and I did a couple of decades ago when Bob Geldof called on us to assist with Live Aid! I do not even dare to compare this campaign with the enormity of what he did - but I highlight it to demonstrate what we individuals can do! 
History has proven that ordinary folk can make a difference!
I do not have a charity - I do not have the resources on standby at this stage - but I have the intention!
Without funds I am unable to engage the services of those who can do the practical work of saving the lives of those children stranded - many of whom have lost their families as they escaped the villages!
I ask you to take the risk with me - make a donation and be part of a movement and do what you can to encourage others to donate!
With enough traction and awareness we will attract, cajole and encourage the involvement of those with tremendous resources to assist us in our endeavours! 
I can not think of a quicker more powerful way to mobilise and engage a large number of people than through a crowd fund campaign! 

  Other Ways You Can Help If you really are unable to contribute then please send this campaign to your network - daily - and to your local media - or mention it in your blog posts - whatever you can think of to assist in making this venture globally viral!

I usually sail Laser but I want to try and qualify for Antigua to have a sailing spot at the Youth Olympic Games in China this summer. The International Byte CII Championship and Youth Olympic Games Qualifier for North America and the Caribbean will be held in Jensen Beach Feb 27 - March 2nd 2014. It is going to cost around US$9,700 per sailor to get there, Rhone Kirby, another 15 year old and me. This covers coach expenses, flights, accommodation, registration, boat rental, coach boat rental, taxi fares, etc., and we have less than 2 weeks to raise the money. The Olympic Office have generously given us some help and we have had a few donations in cash. We have now paid for the registration, boat rental and flights, so there is no turning back now. Fund raising was left very late because we were told in October that Antigua could not send sailors to the Youth Olympics, but now we know that if we qualify, Antigua can be represented. There are 4 spots left and only 8 countries that have not qualified yet, which gives us a 50 50 chance. We know the competition from previous regattas and know we have a good chance of qualifying. This is only open to sailors born in 1998 and 1999 so there is an exceptionally good chance we will win a spot in the Youth Olympics to represent Antigua in China. Rhone and I appreciate any and all help we get so that we can make it to Jensen Beach and make everyone proud. We can do this!

  Nanaimo Aboriginal HIPPY is a program of the Nanaimo Aboriginal Centre
Nanaimo Aboriginal HIPPY is free to all participating families
Nanaimo Aboriginal Centre is a non-profit society with a vision to support the realization of a 100% high school graduation rate for Aboriginal students. A key to realizing our vision is to develop programs and services that support early childhood development from birth to Kindergarten.
Nanaimo Aboriginal HIPPY is one of two in British Columbia. 
 Research shows that when a child living in poverty is provided access to quality, early years programs, they are 30% more likely to graduate high school.  Research also shows that children living in poverty have a significantly smaller vocabulary than their classmates in Kindergarten.  Finally, research shows that the grade 3 literacy rate is now they key indicator for a student's success in high school.  HIPPY addresses all three of these issues.
Please help our program grow.   Our Goal The goal of this campaign is to raise $32,000 during the month of April.  All funds raised will support the growth of our existing Aboriginal HIPPY program in Nanaimo, including the following items:  HIPPY Home Visitor - employ part-time a mom who will be trained to lead home visits and weekly sessions with program parents
Program supplies - each week every participating child is given a new book to keep.  Over the length of the program each child will have accumulated 30 new books.
Administration - a maximum of 15% of funds will cover the cost of program licensing fees, travel for the Home Visitor and office supplies.
To recognize your support, we are offering some beautiful, west coast art pieces like a hand carved red cedar panel, silver pendent, a delicious salmon/bannock lunch or a once in a lifetime chance to build an elk hide hand drum. Please give generously.  Please spread the word.




If we don't raise $32,000 we will still hire a Home Visitor and increase the number of families who can participate proportional to the amount we are able to raise.

In many of these communities, children must cross the river to get to school and families must pass in order to access the main road that leads into town.

<p><strong>Again, we've got hearts full of gratitude today. Can't wait to tell all of you tales from the permaculture front!</strong></p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Story</strong></p>
<p>We are active foodies and aspiring farmers from North Carolina, currently living in Austin, Texas. We have spent the last few years getting our hands dirty and ideas spinning, from becoming a part of a garden project with some of our best friends at Four Sisters' Farm in Hillsborough, NC, to a summer on the incredible <a href=""http://tri-lingual-farming.blogspot.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Ferme du Jointout"">Ferme du Jointout</a> in Torpes, France.  We know we want to have a future farming and the next step is for us to continue our education. With your help, we will attend the <a href=""http://www.permacultureportal.com/courses_current.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Bullock's Permaculture Homestead"">Bullock's Permaculture Homestead</a>'s internationally accredited Permaculture Design Course located in Washington. This is a 2.5-week course with 144 hours of classroom and hands-on learning. We will come out of the course perma-certified and further along the path to creating our future in organic food production.</p>
<p><br/><strong>Permaculture </strong><strong><br/></strong>Permaculture is a creative, holistic design system used to create sustainable food production. It is a combination of the words permanent and agriculture. The word agriculture comes from <em><strong>agre; field</strong></em><em> </em>and <em><strong>cultura; tillage of the soil....</strong></em><em></em>Hence, permaculture aims to till the same soil permanently. It is a facilitation and appreciation of the harmonious relationships between every element in an ecosystem; including humans! A few of its broadest and simplest goals are: to create a balanced input and output of energy, to produce a high yield in a little space, to increase biodiversity, and to reuse/recycle water.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong><em> </em> <br/> We know we still have a lot to learn, but this will get us a little closer. Permaculture is one of the most exciting movements in today's food revolution and we want to share this with other people. Not only do we want to learn these skills to implement on our future land, we want to be able to help our friends and family plan their gardens, we want to be able to practice permaculture in our everyday lives, and we want to be proponents and educators.  Eventually we hope to initiate and be a part of a permanent homestead and small-scale production farm. When we do, you can come visit us anytime you want!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>Our fundraising goal is to cover the cost of combined tuition for both of us -<strong> $4,000</strong></p>
<p>The additional<strong> $500</strong> is to cover driving from texas to washington in Wayne, a 1992 toyota camry - gas, food, campsites, etc .</p>
<p>Anything we raise above that will offset the percentage we pay indiegogo once the funds come in...</p>

</div></div>","In 2011, a small group of university students started the Scientific Culture Society which provides educational programs to public schools and underprivileged communities. Through our Fun Science Program, we've worked with 300 Syrian refugee youth and over 500 public school students so far. Now we want to expand and integrate our projects into the Science League, a project modeled after the Boy and Girl Scouts, that combines personal growth with scientific education and innovation.The Science League: Through gamification and hands-on education, kids (ages 5-18) will work in teams to achieve learning objectives and earn badges by completing tasks and missions that encourage scientific learning, critical thinking and direct interaction with the natural world and their communities. It is our belief that, through activities that build critical thought and scientific literacy, children can grow in character and realize their place in this AWESOME universe, giving them hope and unleashing their full potential.Help Us Launch The Science League!
The Problem: Public school students, especially Syrian refugees and those who live in rural areas, have inadequate educational facilities and resources.  This puts them at a disadvantage when competing for jobs to bring back money for their families. 
On a larger scale, the lack of proper education weakens Jordan's ability to solve its three main challenges: the severe lack of water resources, the ongoing energy crisis, and the surge in extremism that has developed due to poverty. Our Solution:Through after school Science, Technology, Engineering and Math programs (STEM), we provide students with a safe space for scientific exploration and personal growth as well as career counseling. By working with university students and trained professionals, students will learn to express themselves and build their understanding of the natural world and the global community to which they belong.
While we already have a program and a dedicated team who are working for free, we now need a physical space to apply this program and hire some expert help. 
We've estimated our starting cost at around $55,000 USD. Although modest, this would cover everything we need from staff salaries to lab faculties and equipment, and pull us through the first year and a half. Ideally, we'd be self-sufficient by year two, sustaining the program on a small fee-basis.  




Goal: We set the scale for a minimum enrollment of 300 students for the first year. These estimates are based on an annual revenue obtained through the collection of a monthly fee of $30 USD from each student. These fees will be covered by your donations and our corporate sponsors.


- Give young boys and girls the power and the knowledge to take charge of their future and shape their country.
- The Scientific Culture Society will be able to stand on its own feet by becoming self-sufficient within two years!
- Your contribution will help launch our young non-profit organization to new levels. We will be able to effectively expand our programs to areas across the nation, reaching schools and communities in rural or disadvantaged locations.
Join the League, support science!

While overshadowed by the 'death throes of the old paradigm' wreaking havoc worldwide, it is manifesting quietly and inexorably, and patently evident to those with the eyes to see.

Saharadevi has been carried and driven by the Evolution Revolution since it came to her in India/1999, and has since devoted her life to carrying the message.

Recently, the energy increased exponentially with an event sponsored by the Bodhi Tree Bookstore/Los Angeles, and an invitation to The 4th International Conference and Gathering of the Elders in India/March 2012. 


The significance of this invitation and the impact it will have is manifold, enabling Sahara to share the message of this global manifestation with the Elders of Ancient Traditions, and the Elders to acknowledge and endorse the phenomenon, sharing it to their respective communities and building critical mass.


The importance of garnering awareness of the Evolution Revolution on the world stage lies in  Jeremy Rifkin's question, whether we can ï¿½reach biosphere consciousness and

<p>Hello! My name is Ashley Mendez and I am a Junior at Lighthouse Community Charter school in Oakland, CA. Last summer, I went to El Salvador. I visited my grandma and my aunt who was pregnant at the time. One day, we went out to el mercado. This is a place where they sell fresh fruits and vegetables out on the street. I was placing an order of cheese when I received a light tap on my shoulder. I looked down to see a small boy with a ripped up tee and no shoes. “Cómpreme una cora de tomates porfavor.” The little boy was asking me to buy him a quarter worth of tomatoes. My heart instantly dropped. I saw myself in the little boy because that could’ve been me if my parents hadn’t come to the U.S. I wondered why he wasn’t in school and why he was working so young. I am grateful that my parents escaped the poverty and starvation to provide a better lifestyle for me and my brother. In addition to being grateful for my family, I also felt sympathetic to those in need. </p>

In June I will be going to Dominican Republic to teach and help students learn English and participate in various community service opportunities.

just need some financial support to get started! To give you just a few
examples, we want to organize a 6 weeks photography
workshop which will explore the themes of belongings and settling into a new
country. In order for all the participants to be equally able to express their
creativity, they would need to be able to access same standard equipment. For
this reason, some of the money we raise will help to buy good quality cameras!
We want to run a monthly film club and screen
educational movies including documentaries about life stories of refugees
around the world! We would need a new projector to make this happen :)
Some of our refugee volunteers are amazing artists
who can facilitate art classes and teach with a multicultural
approach. Some of the things that our young people will be able to learn
include: sculpture, clay modelling, frame making, puppet making, painting and
jewellery! We would need financial support in order to buy specific material
for this purpose including beautiful natural colours which often come from our
volunteers' countries of origin!
If we manage to raise enough money on time, we
would like to involve our young people into a graffiti festival which will take place in London during the end of
June and 1st week of July in order to let them meet international
artists and try something new and exciting!! For this event, we would need to
buy sprays and paper panels so that they can unleash their creativity :)
We are also organizing some fantastic summer activities for our young people in order to enable them to
socialize, make friendship and enjoy the holidays even if their families have
very limited financial resources. A summer camp, climbing, go-karting, kayaking
and possibly a trip to a farm are just some of the activities we have in
mind!!! The summer activities will take place over 6 weeks starting from around
the 7th of July until around the 21st of August. Your
generous donation would help us to cover the costs and thanks to you our young
people will build beautiful memories which will gradually replace their
traumatic experiences.
Finally, one of our dreams is to set up a bike project where young people can exchange useful skills and learn how
to fix the bikes themselves! In order to get it started, we would need some
money to buy 2 or 3 bikes to begin with. We hope that you can support us to
make our dreams come true. Please help us, be generous, be kind, share your love and spread a little happiness!!!...Our young people and all our team would be forever grateful! All kind of contributions are welcome, getting the word out to promote our projects would be a great help too!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What We Do</h3>
<p>The Sellam Circus School (LLC) is a circus arts academy based in Biddeford, Maine, that will offer both recreational and professional-level classes in circus skills and performance, as well as forums on circus history, technical courses in rigging, and practical introductions to tent maintenance and mechanics.  The Sellam Circus School’s Professional Circus Arts Training (PCAT) course and PCAT Preparatory course is designed to conclude with one month of training and performance in the big top tent.  Our goal is to bring our students into the ring, and connect them with the tradition of circus, by ensuring their access to Master-level coaches, and the enchanting environment of the big top tent.</p>
<h3><strong>Our Mission</strong></h3>
<p>The mission of The Sellam Circus School is to pass on excellent performance technique, actively preserve the traditions of circus, and provide a performance venue for graduating students.  The Sellam Circus School is committed to creating avenues for students to connect with the rich history and traditions of circus.  </p>
<p>Teaching in a big top tent is central to our identity.  Poised between circus instruction and cultural anthropology, The Sellam Circus School is based upon two principles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy access to world-class, professional circus arts coaching; and</li>
<li>Preservation, sharing and promotion of the culture and traditions of traveling circus.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>In 2016 and 2017</strong>, with your help, we raised needed startup funds - and hit the ground running!  Your support allowed us to purchase vital equipment, participate in Maine coast festivals and events,  begin developing a traveling workshop program, and initiate negotiations for our dream location.  Your support also enable us to lease a beautiful big top tent, and launch the inaugural season of our Maine Coast Summer Circus Arts program! </p>

<p><b>Our</b><strong> Maine Coast Summer Circus Arts Program </strong>was created<strong> </strong>with the mission to provide traveling circus arts day camp sessions to under-served communities throughout coastal Maine, and the larger New England area.  In our inaugural year, thanks to your generous support, we were able to share the joy of circus with communities in Rockport and Bar Harbor, Maine.  </p>

<p>Charlotte allowed us to start out strong in our partnership with College of the Atlantic, and make a huge impact in the lives of our students - many of whom had never been inside a circus tent before, and were also experiencing circus arts <i>for the very first time</i>.  We saw great leaps and bounds forward with our students last summer, and the memories that were made are truly life-long gems.  Your contributions enabled us to give these students an unforgettable, once-in-a-lifetime experience.</p>
<p>This year, we are intensifying our efforts to purchase our own big top.  <strong>This is no small goal:  The cost of a quality, used, Italian-engineered circus big top is estimated at approximately $42,000.</strong>   This is why we are working to achieve our goal through means beyond our IndieGoGo campaign.  In particular, we have been working with a local Biddeford community organization to plan for a great summer of fun - including applying for grant funding, and planning programming and events that will extend year round.  <strong>Every bit of support helps, and your contribution - of any size - is greatly appreciated.</strong></p>
<p>With our very own big top, we will be able to offer programs well into late Fall/early Winter, start up again with the first days of Spring, and reach even more communities throughout coastal Maine and New England.  By teaching inside a big top tent, we are able to immediately connect our students with the legacy of circus arts in the most meaningful way.  Each day, students will not only learn how to juggle, ride a unicycle, climb the aerial silks and tumble inside the ring; they will also learn about the history of the canvas tent in American and European circuses, including how a tent is set up, rigged, and maintained.  At the heart of every traveling circus is a well-loved and maintained tent!</p>

<h3><strong>The Sellam Approach</strong></h3>
<p>The Sellam Circus School is master coach Sellam El Ouahabi's way to give back what he has learned during a lifetime in traveling circus. Sellam's students know that there is one standard that he insists upon from all who attend his classes:  <i><strong>They must train from the heart.  </strong></i>Coaches enjoy students who love what they do, and students learn best from coaches with a deep love and appreciation of circus. </p>
<p>Through over three decades of performance and coaching around the world, Sellam is actively connected with the incredible people - students <i>and</i> coaches - that make The Sellam Circus School a unique and invaluable resource for training.  </p>

<p>There's nothing quite like entering the big top:  The smell of the sun-warmed canvas; the sound of the ropes gently chiming against the kingpoles; the experience of walking into the center ring.  There is no other way to say it:  It's a whole new way to learn circus arts.  Of course, it's not new at all . . . but it's sadly not easy to find, these days.  Your support will help us to bring circus instruction back into the tent for the benefit of our community, as well as provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>An Iconic Symbol:</strong>  Teaching inside a tent allows us to send an instant and clear signal about what we do.  We teach circus arts technique, and we share circus culture.  Those passing by on the sidewalk or highway will know instantly that there is a circus happening . . . and want to know more.  The tent will be a lightning bolt for excitement in our community!</li>
<li>
<strong>Room To Move: </strong> Our tent will have a maximum capacity of 650 people.  That means that there is room for our students to really move, to experiment, to find space to explore their discipline of choice - all while still being intimately connected inside an historic space.</li>
<li>
<strong>Industry Standard:  </strong>One of the biggest challenges when planning a circus learning space is finding enough ceiling height, and a safe, reliable rigging point.  Teaching in a tent solves all of these issues.  A big top tent offers upwards of 60 feet of vertical height (most permanent structures top out at 25 feet), and a rigging structure that has been engineered to meet standard industry expectations for weight load and safety.  Done deal!</li>

It worked for me so I want to give it forward. </p><p>To do this, I must first take a 200 hour yoga teacher training course that will provide me the skills, information and support to apply my own success with yoga to others.</p><p>However, my own cancer journey has left me unemployed and struggling to pay basic bills.  I work hard, very hard but I need your support to transform my dream of helping other survivors into a reality.  Please know that every penny will help me as a survivor help future cancer survivors.</p><h3> </h3><h3><strong>My Story:</strong></h3><p>My name is Veronica de Paulo, I am 51 years old, I am Brazilian, I have been living in the US for the past 16 years. The first time I heard about Yoga was 30 years ago. I was very curious and interested in the subject, but I soon realized that yoga was not accessible to people of my socioeconomic status; I did not know any person or school who practiced, books were rare and expensive.</p><p>In 2003 I had my first yoga class, it was Bikram yoga. At that time, a life story was established and it seemed inevitable that Yoga would change my entire relationship with my body since my corporal consciousness and my diet naturally became healthier after Yoga class.</p><p>In 2009 I was diagnosed with breast cancer at a very advanced stage. This new reality was devastating and one of the things that scared me was the possibility, almost inevitable, to not be able to practice Capoeira and Yoga anymore, the two great passions in my life, my daily companions, my ""treats"" after long working hours.</p><p>During the first 2 years of treatment, chemotherapy, radiation, mastectomy and breast reconstitution, I was unable to practice Bikram yoga, due to the high temperature required in class. So I keep a moderate capoeira practicing and few Vinyasa flow Yoga once or twice a week.</p><p>Then In 2011 I was diagnosed with <i>lymphedema</i>, a chronic condition caused by the withdrawal of various lymph nodules that were compromised by the new reality of the cancer. This situation had increased even more my physical limitations. I feared that those were my last days practicing yoga and capoeira. </p><p>It was at that time I came to yoga class for cancer with Tari Prinster.  The room was full of  women, most of them had never practiced yoga before. Even though I was used to a more vigorous yoga, this was a unique opportunity to keep practicing yoga and learn about how to manage my lymphedema.  </p><p>Over time, those warrior women who overcame cancer also overcame the obstacles and improved day by day the perform of the yoga asanas inspiring each other.</p><p>My personal experience at that time was rediscovering my body as my first home, the original home in which we live a lifetime...It was necessary to reorganize the home that had suffered a strong shock and had compromised structures. The yoga classes was indispensable, vital and gave me hope and strength.</p><p>Also, I started to realize that my presence and practices inspired other women who always showed appreciation.The teachers, Tari Prinster, founder of the yoga4cancer, and Kelly Considine (in memory), were two people who always encouraged and inspired me to take the next step and becoming an yoga instructor and help others in the same situation.</p><p>All the doctors that took care of me were impressed with my strength, disposition and recovery; they also encouraged me to follow my practice because the result is undeniable. Yoga classes has also helped me cope with anxiety, fear and sadness; little by little I recovered my life.</p><p>During these seven years of fighting cancer and a chronic lymphedema condition, loss of employment and fighting in court to not be evicted, yoga has been my daily companion, a magical path of self- knowledge and empowerment.</p><p>My personal experience with other women who has experienced cancer and practice yoga reassures me of the benefits of this practice to all its enormous healing power. With that awareness, love and dedication that I have decided to expand my knowledge to improve my own practice and at the same time to share that knowledge and benefits with other people, especially people with financial difficulties whom are struggling against cancer.</p><h3>Details of the Training:</h3><p>To be a qualified and informed yoga teacher,  I must complete a 200 hour yoga teacher training.  I have chosen to take the training with the studio - <a href=""http://www.yogaforpeople.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Yoga to the People </a>- that has generously supported me both before and after my cancer treatments.  They are a non-profit studio that's mission is to make yoga available to everyone,regardless of his or her financial constraints.  That is evident in the free classes they have given me for the past 4 years so that I can stay healthy and active in my yoga practice and life.  </p><p>The 200 hour training costs - $2,850.  If I am able to raise enough funds by Sept 1st, I can get the early bird discount at $2,450. My training will begin on Sept 30 and complete on December 17, 2016.k</p><p>The training curriculum is:</p><ul>
<li>Breaking Down the Asanas (Poses)</li>
<li>Adjustments &amp; Alignment</li>
<li>Yoga Philosophy &amp; History</li>
<li>Anatomy for Yoga</li>
<li>Breathing Techniques</li>
<li>Teaching a Class / Class Sequencing</li>

It worked for me so I want to give it forward. To do this, I must first take a 200 hour yoga teacher training course that will provide me the skills, information and support to apply my own success with yoga to others.However, my own cancer journey has left me unemployed and struggling to pay basic bills.  I work hard, very hard but I need your support to transform my dream of helping other survivors into a reality.  Please know that every penny will help me as a survivor help future cancer survivors. My Story:My name is Veronica de Paulo, I am 51 years old, I am Brazilian, I have been living in the US for the past 16 years. The first time I heard about Yoga was 30 years ago. I was very curious and interested in the subject, but I soon realized that yoga was not accessible to people of my socioeconomic status; I did not know any person or school who practiced, books were rare and expensive.In 2003 I had my first yoga class, it was Bikram yoga. At that time, a life story was established and it seemed inevitable that Yoga would change my entire relationship with my body since my corporal consciousness and my diet naturally became healthier after Yoga class.In 2009 I was diagnosed with breast cancer at a very advanced stage. This new reality was devastating and one of the things that scared me was the possibility, almost inevitable, to not be able to practice Capoeira and Yoga anymore, the two great passions in my life, my daily companions, my ""treats"" after long working hours.During the first 2 years of treatment, chemotherapy, radiation, mastectomy and breast reconstitution, I was unable to practice Bikram yoga, due to the high temperature required in class. So I keep a moderate capoeira practicing and few Vinyasa flow Yoga once or twice a week.Then In 2011 I was diagnosed with lymphedema, a chronic condition caused by the withdrawal of various lymph nodules that were compromised by the new reality of the cancer. This situation had increased even more my physical limitations. I feared that those were my last days practicing yoga and capoeira. It was at that time I came to yoga class for cancer with Tari Prinster.  The room was full of  women, most of them had never practiced yoga before. Even though I was used to a more vigorous yoga, this was a unique opportunity to keep practicing yoga and learn about how to manage my lymphedema.  Over time, those warrior women who overcame cancer also overcame the obstacles and improved day by day the perform of the yoga asanas inspiring each other.My personal experience at that time was rediscovering my body as my first home, the original home in which we live a lifetime...It was necessary to reorganize the home that had suffered a strong shock and had compromised structures. The yoga classes was indispensable, vital and gave me hope and strength.Also, I started to realize that my presence and practices inspired other women who always showed appreciation.The teachers, Tari Prinster, founder of the yoga4cancer, and Kelly Considine (in memory), were two people who always encouraged and inspired me to take the next step and becoming an yoga instructor and help others in the same situation.All the doctors that took care of me were impressed with my strength, disposition and recovery; they also encouraged me to follow my practice because the result is undeniable. Yoga classes has also helped me cope with anxiety, fear and sadness; little by little I recovered my life.During these seven years of fighting cancer and a chronic lymphedema condition, loss of employment and fighting in court to not be evicted, yoga has been my daily companion, a magical path of self- knowledge and empowerment.My personal experience with other women who has experienced cancer and practice yoga reassures me of the benefits of this practice to all its enormous healing power. With that awareness, love and dedication that I have decided to expand my knowledge to improve my own practice and at the same time to share that knowledge and benefits with other people, especially people with financial difficulties whom are struggling against cancer.Details of the Training:To be a qualified and informed yoga teacher,  I must complete a 200 hour yoga teacher training.  I have chosen to take the training with the studio - Yoga to the People - that has generously supported me both before and after my cancer treatments.  They are a non-profit studio that's mission is to make yoga available to everyone,regardless of his or her financial constraints.  That is evident in the free classes they have given me for the past 4 years so that I can stay healthy and active in my yoga practice and life.  The 200 hour training costs - $2,850.  If I am able to raise enough funds by Sept 1st, I can get the early bird discount at $2,450. My training will begin on Sept 30 and complete on December 17, 2016.kThe training curriculum is:
Breaking Down the Asanas (Poses)
Adjustments & Alignment
Yoga Philosophy & History
Anatomy for Yoga
Breathing Techniques
Teaching a Class / Class Sequencing
Overview of Other Kinds of Yoga
Upon graduation from the course, I will be certified and able to register myself with Yoga Alliance for my RYT.  This will provide the validation to teach classes, privates and beyond.  For more information about the training, please check it out here.What will I do with the Training:After receiving my yoga teaching certification,  my goal will then to gain the advanced training with Tari Prinster - my initial yoga for cancer teacher and mentor.  Her organization - yoga4cancer - is considered the best for advanced cancer teacher training and has trained over 1,600 yoga teachers.  I plan to join Tari and her community to implement my new skills so that I can help other survivors like me to live longer, healthier and happier through yoga.  Why I need the financial support?Cancer brings financial challenges along with the physical and psychological that I - and many others have faced.  I lost my job and have struggled with paying my significant bills.  Since...",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi, I’m Daphne Gabriel and I am actor fundraising my attendance at Bristol Old Vic Theatre School this fall. I'm currently a member of The Actors’ Gang and Imagine Us Free. I've performed all over Los Angeles with Opera del Espacio. I went Off-Broadway and did a social awareness piece called Innocent Flesh, a one act play on sex trafficking, and was offered a place at the amazing<a href=""http://www.oldvic.ac.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Bristol Old Vic Theatre School""> Bristol Old Vic Theatre School</a> (BOVTS). This exquisite conservatory is located in West England in an amazing city called Bristol. BOVTS has been around since 1946 opened by world renowned actor Sir Laurence Olivier. The course I will be taking is the MA Professional Acting Course (One Yr course). I will be taking courses focused on the classical British and European repertoire, with emphasis given to hands-on exploration of Shakespearean text in performance. The course is also centered on developing the actor’s voice and body, training the actor with the knowledge and technique to fulfill the physical and vocal demands of a professional stage and screen performance.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>               Alumni include: <em>Daniel Day Lewis, Gene Wilder,<br/>           Sir Patrick Stewart, Naomie Harris, Pete Postlethwaite,<br/>               Greta Scacchi, Jeremy Irons, Mark Strong,</em> and <em>Antonia Thomas</em>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>BOVTS is part of the UK's<a href=""http://www.cdd.ac.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""CONSERVATOIRE FOR DANCE AND DRAMA""> Conservatoire for Dance and Drama</a>, and is one of only three drama schools to be affiliated. BOVTS is recognized by the the UK government for being a leader in training in the arts.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I grew up South Central Los Angeles where young girls aren't always encouraged to dream big. My mother and father noticed my interest in the arts when I was very young and decided to enroll me in acting classes. Since then I sang in my church choir and performed in every play. As a young actor, I looked for actors whom I could see myself in and admired to be like; Meryl Streep, Daniel Day Lewis, Angela Bassett, Naomie Harris, and Sanaa Lathan. Though, I admired these actors I hoped for someone I could reach out to. There are many girls in my neighborhood who are, right now, looking for the same thing. </p>
<p>There is a desperate need for classically trained women of color in the arts and I hope to be, along with many other actresses, a catalyst that takes such an opportunity and run with it. Once back from my training, I will be creating an art programs for young children in South Central Los Angeles in hopes of helping them find their creative voice. Acting, Theatre, and Film have been vital in my confidence and with that I want to make a mark in this industry and inspire confidence and hope in many young children to dream BIG!</p>

<p><strong>                                Why  I need this and what You get?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve tried twice before to attend conservatory training, but wasn’t able to because of one reason: money. This is my third try and my very last resort. When I saw how much I had to come up with, I felt overwhelmed and doubtful of whether I could make it happen.  My will is strong  and of course, there most certainly is a way!</p>
<p>Studying and living in England is quite expensive. Yes, yes it-tis. Tuition is 17,500 (GDP), which is $27,500. Living expenses run about 10,000 (GDP), which is $15,700. We just sent in about $9500 to hold my spot for this fall, but of course, I must come up with the rest of the finances. An estimated $3000 - $4000 will be covered by yours truly. The rest is where YOU come in!</p>
<p>Why this so important:</p>
<p>Your contribution will help me become a role model to young children in my communnity. I want them to know that they must always follow their dreams. </p>

The Donation money you send will help to decrease delinquency of young kids in the street in Haiti, and also build believing leaders for this nation to support those children's development in the future also.
we set up this campaign as an easy way for those of you who wish to help out to do so. This campaign will give the kids a second chance to find joy in their life and to grow to become a responsible adult. Any help you can give in form, which Lord places in your heart is welcome. there are no minimum amount or other requirement. Your prays for this project are most welcome also.
So the helpless has hope, you are the one who help us to bring joy in their life, hear it and know it for yourself, because you send your support to them. God will help this project to come through, if it pleases him, so pray for us and help us in any way you see fit.
What we need & What you get
We need 100000 USD to get started with this projec, it will help us to buy a land from Haiti and start the construction of the rehabilitation center for the kids who live in the street without hope, family and nothing and still do not know who Jesus is. We want to offer them a place where they can find joy and also meet Jesus.
The Land and the building will be put under the name of the organization which is founded already for this project. With donation money, life will be transformes in Haiti for men and women who will be to work for the next generation. They will work as teacher, supporters, mentors and such for these children. We have no money or other earthly means to offer to you in return, but those children that will be enjoying the facilities that you help us to build, will for sure be grateful. You will be impacting the lives of these children for long time.

<h3>Roman Needs a Laptop</h3>
<p>I have been a friend of Roman's for over 10 years. He is a hardworking and dedicated 21 year old. He hasn't always had the material things that some of us take for granted, but that has never stopped his hard work and determination.</p>
<p>Roman struggled a bit in high school, and therefore was unable to go straight to a four year college, but instead went to City College of SF and worked hard to obtain his AA degree, AND win the state championship in football.</p>
<p>Roman was accepted to the University of Idaho, and is also playing football for their team, the Vandals. He is #87, and is already making his mark!</p>
<p>Roman is finding it a bit harder to maintain his grades and keep up with his work at a four year college, and having an old undependable laptop isn't helping!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Hoping to Raise enough for a decent laptop ( UNABLE to change the amount NEEDED - but will be happy if we can get to $1000)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Every dollar given will go directly towards Roman's new laptop ( tax, warranty &amp; fundraising fees)</li>
<li>Depending on your contribution, you can earn baked goods or an entire home cooked dinner!!</li>
<li>Whether the goal is reached or not, all funds will go towards a new laptop - if we don't reach our goal the funds will go into a savings account, until our goal is reached.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Please help Roman be successful</h3>
<ul>
<li>Many of us take a working computer for granted - please help Roman with a computer that will last him the duration of his time at the University of Idaho. Please help make a difference in his education and his life</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
At the Mansfield Art Center we know that many of us would not have the joy of a career in the arts, the chance to do what we love every day, if we hadn't had great mentors along the way.  That is why we want to create the Summer Art Mentorship Program so area youth can have the privilage of a one-on-one experience with a professional artist who cares about them. </div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
There are some basic costs involved with properly screening our mentors and administering this program.  We need a small amount of money, only $2500 to ensure that we can execute this impactful program.  As a sponsor you will be invited to the end of summer party where you can meet the youth and their mentors as well as have the opportunity to see their artwork they made over the summer.</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
Mentorship works!  Youth who have mentors excel far beyond their peers and we want to nurture any young person who loves art.</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
If you can't spare a few bucks, you can still volunteer as a mentor or donate art supplies.  Or better yet, ask a friend to donate!</div></div>","Short Summary

<h3><span style=""color: #084b8a;"">Why Fashion?</span></h3>
<p>Fashion is a form of expression that transcends many cultures and worldviews because of its universal nature. Though individuals may differ in how they express themselves through fashion, it remains something that people from all different walks of life can appreciate and contribute to. In addition, fashion is a medium that presents unique opportunities to impact the lives of people by elevating awareness about societal issues such as rising college costs and the increasing need for scholarship programs. Fashion is done everyday, but it is not everyday that fashion is used to benefit the lives of students.</p>

<h3><span style=""color: #084b8a;"">The Benefits You Get</span></h3>
<p>There are no profits being made, just a scholarship fund being formed. Therefore, you get the benefit of knowing that by contributing to this campaign in any way, you are directly contributing to helping students fund their education. The two students you will help fund will be students that are selected after an objective scholarship application process, so you can rest assured that they will be deserving all around. In addition, if you choose a perk at the <strong>Supporter Level</strong> or above you get one or more customized bracelets produced by Isolated Art Design Studio.

                          You are who you are. Period.
 
We are building expectations for kids to try and live up to, those can generate a lot of disappointment, confusion and unhappiness.
equality for ALL..
Let's teach kids today that they just are who they are, and its for them to find out what brings them joy. It's through the ability to truely accept and love yourself that we are able to treat others like we want to be treated. 

It's that simple. To make the world a better place.
The book I Am Me speaks both to kids and adults. It was initially written in Hebrew and was translated to English while maintaing it's sweet and flowing charm. When you order make sure to specify the desired language.
By supporting the publication of this book you'll help deliver this message of equality, self acceptance and love to young kids, helping to sculpt their vision of this world and encouraging them to be kind towards themselves and others.

<h3></h3>
<h3>Short Summary</h3>My name is Charlie Curtis and my dream is to attend Indiana University 
and attain a degree in Business; more specifically marketing. I have 
already outlined a business plan for a mobile application and website 
designed to use crowdsourcing for funding college education to help kids like me. I wish I had 
thought of it earlier but I don't have the time or the resources to 
build it in time for me to try to fund my college education. I have 
already been accepted to IU, and the only reason I wouldn't be able 
to go would be a lack of funds. At a steep rate of 45,000 a year, my 
family simply can't afford it. The Kelley School of Business at Indiana University is ranked the 6th best marketing 
school and number 1 in the nation in terms of job placement, and a 
degree from Kelley would give me the capabilities and talents needed to 
build my business and find work after college.<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Obviously,
 any dollar amount would help toward my cost, whether it be one dollar 
or 500. What I plan to do is donate the same dollar amount I receive 
from crowd funding toward the general scholarship fund at IU after I 
graduate. While this will not directly affect most backers, most people 
understand the value of a college education, and this money would help 
kids like myself fulfill their dreams.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>Simply
 put, this campaign is going toward nothing more than my college 
education. I feel that a degree from Indiana is the best education I can
 get, and will put me in a position to succeed for the rest of my 
working life.<br/><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Spread my
 campaign by any means necessary! Use facebook, twitter, or any other 
social media! Obviously some people won't be able to help financially, 
but that doesn't mean you can't help by spreading the word! Any form of 
help is appreciated!<p></p></span></div>","Short SummaryMy name is Charlie Curtis and my dream is to attend Indiana University

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi everyone, Cheyenne here! As I'm sure many of you know it can be dificult to figure out what you are meant to do with your life. I have struggled with this since finishing my B.A. almost six years ago. A year and a half ago I started working as an assistant librarian at a local high school. Immidiately I realized how much I loved this job and went on the hunt for how to make a career out of it. I have just been accepted into the Masters of Library and Information Science program at the University of Denver. (YAY!!)</p>
<p>As a result of this acceptance I will be relocating to Denver, Colorado on May 23rd, 2013. As I'm sure many of you know relocating can be very stressful and expensive. I'm trying to raise the money for my moving expences and first and last month's rent.</p>
<p>I'm not trying to pull any punches here, all the money will be going directly to me to assist in my move. Your generosity will help me immensely! </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am trying to raise money for my first and last months' rent and for the shipping of my things. I know that times are tough for everyone and I would greatly appreciate any donation you can afford.</p>
<p>I am offering different gifts for different levels of monetary donation. These gifts are nothing fancy, but fun little tidbits to make this process fun for everyone. You can see the detail of these offers on the right hand side of the screen. </p>
<p>If I reach my goal in time, Indiegogo takes 4% of my profits as payment. If I do not reach my goal in time I will still get my funds, but Indiegogo will keep 9% of the profits. So please help me get there on time.  :-) </p>

<h3>What is El Campo?</h3>
<p>'El' in Kyrgyz means 'people' so El Campo literally means 'The Peoples' Camp.' This 8-day overnight camp will include 70 campers from the rural areas of Kyrgyzstan. Its purpose is to empower Kyrgyz youth with lessons in civic engagement, cross-cultural awareness, project planning and implementation, and creativity through the arts. We aim to highlight the connection between creative thought, tolerance and strong leadership. The camp will conclude with our most important goal, where campers will apply their knowledge to create grassroot social projects within their communities, and realize their capacity for positive impacts.</p>
<p>Be a part of the movement. Be a part of the change. Because with El Campo, change lies in the hands of our youth!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>How You Can Help! </strong></h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>The funds we are asking for will be used towards meal purchases and transportation for staff and campers. As an over-night camp, 3 meals per day will need to be provided to all 70 campers. Additionally, because we want to reach out to youth in the more rural areas of Kyrgyzstan, transportation funds will be used to subsidize the cost of traveling to and from the camp for campers who may not otherwise be able to afford it. </p>
<p>Don't forget to look at our perks for donating! Perks range from receiving our bi-daily El Campo newsletter to keep you up-to-date on the camp events to our commemorative video to an official El Campo T-shirt!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Our Impact in Kyrgyzstan</h3>
<p>Through the formal education system in Kyrgyzstan youth are not given opportunities to express creativity nor solve challenges through critical thinking methods. During our first annual El Campo in the summer of 2012 we saw huge results in our campers taking initiatives to lead in their communities.</p>
<p>Many of the campers became more active in the social sphere, participated in youth engagement events and many even became members volunteer-based NGOs. Camper-initiated projects included: the creation of an assembly to frequent local orphanages, the initiation of national park clean-up group, and the formation of a lemonade-stand project that raised money for disenfranchised children. </p>

<p>This summer of 2013 Get On The Green is raising money for Providence Cristo Rey, a private, Catholic, college-preparatory high school devoted to providing a free education to under-privileged and at-risk youth.</p>
<p><strong>THE EVENT </strong></p>
<p><strong><em>From Tee to Shining Tee </em></strong>is the fundraising event through which awareness and money will be raised for Providence Cristo Rey. I will be striking a golf ball from Monterey Peninsula, California all the way to the beaches just south of Charleston, South Carolina. I will be playing the ball as it lays, on old country roads, through fields, and through the desert. The trip will take about 110 days, 48,000 swings, and 3,200 lost golf balls to complete.</p>
<p>Many golf fundraisers and charity events have had great success with golf marathons. This is the ultimate golf marathon and is a true endurance event.

<p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>Get On The Green's fundraising goal is to be able to give $100,000 to Providence Cristo Rey. Our estimated trip costs are $15,000. Therefore, to achieve our goal of giving Providence $100,000 we would need to raise $115,000 total.</p>
<p>Giving $100,000 to Providence will pay for the tuition for 15 underprivileged kids. The program at Providence is highly transformative. The school has a 100% graduation rate and a 100% college acceptance rate. What makes the school unique is that they fit 5 days of school into 4. On the fifth day the students participate in a work study program at various businesses around Indianapolis. This experience has a tremendous impact on these young peoples' lives.</p>

Hello! My name is Luke Bielawski. I am in my final year of law school in Indianapolis, Indiana. This year I started a not-for-profit called Get On The Green to give back to the youth in my community. 
WHAT IS GET ON THE GREEN?
Get On The Green is an Indiana-based 501(c)(3) not-for-profit corporation that uses the game of golf to raise awareness and fundraising for worthwhile local, regional, and national charities.

<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h4>What is Radio Interferometry, why is it important, and why should we donate to this project?</h4>
<p></p><p></p><p>Radio Interferometry is used to increase the 
angular 
resolution and signal detection capability of
 radio telescopes. By taking multiple radio telescopes, even those of 
smaller dish sizes, and spacing them some distance apart (meters to 
kilometres) in a baseline and while aligning their focus on the same 
object, we can combine the angular resolution of the smaller dishes so 
that they act 
as one large radio telescope. If we were to take four, 3 meter radio 
telescopes and place them in an baseline array 30 meters apart from each
 other, 
we can increase their combined capability into one very large radio 
telescope that is able to see astronomical objects in greater clarity, 
and with a stronger signal, 
than those individual radio telescopes observing on their own.    This 
is achieved by aperture synthesis, otherwise known as synthesis 
imaging, which is a method of interferometry that mixes 
signals from a collection of telescopes to produce images having the 
same angular resolution
 as an instrument the size of the entire collection. At each separation 
and orientation, the lobe-pattern of the interferometer produces an 
output which is one component of the Fourier transform
 of the spatial distribution of the brightness of the observed object,
 the Fourier transform is a mathematical transformation that we use to 
transform signals between time, or spatial, domain and frequency domain,
 it is reversible, being able to transform from either domain to the 
other.  The image of the astronomical object is produced from these 
measurements.  </p><p></p><p>This link provides basic information about radio telescope interferometry:  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEqKfnz5VRE"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Guide to Interferometry</a></p><p></p><p></p><p>It is this combination of enhanced angular resolution and
 ability to combine smaller radio dishes to act as a unified larger 
radio 
telescope that makes interferometry such an important aspect of 
radio astronomy, the enhanced signal collection and data analysis this 
provides us, provides greater detail about the objects in our solar 
system and within our Universe.</p><p></p><p>This is a tool that 
has never before been available to schools, for them to learn a new 
field of science, hands-on, and to explore the different physical 
properties and aspects of astronomical objects that optical telescopes 
can not see. The ability to explore a black hole, such as the SMBH at 
the centre of our galaxy (Sgr A*), and see it in greater detail for 
themselves, having done the research that collected that data 
themselves, is an exciting aspect that many of us would have liked for 
ourselves, but were never provided that opportunity to learn different 
aspects of those sciences that would make that possible, to involve 
ourselves directly with doing work in those scientific aspects, to 
explore the Universe in a whole new 
way.    

 Why not contribute to making that a possibility for the children in the
 schools of today? To expanding their horizons with new concepts in a 
future where science has an ever growing importance, to allow them to 
relive many of our childhood dream's of looking out at the stars, but 
through the radio spectrum with a radio telescope, instead of through 
the eyepiece of an optical telescope? </p>
<p>The other benefit is that this provides amateur 
astronomers, 
citizen scientists and any member of the public interested in exploring 
astronomical objects through the method of radio astronomy, the 
opportunity to access the radio 
interferometer baseline array for their own research using a scientific 
research grade tool, 
never before available to them. While some amateur astronomers 
may have access to a self built radio telescope, none have had access to
 a scientifically viable radio interferometer baseline array for greater
 research capabilities. To expand upon their research interests with 
greater signal cohesion, angular resolution, image synthesis, spectral 
analysis, to explore in greater detail, their objects of interest 
through
 multi-wavelength capability. </p><p>Supporting this 
project provides multiple benefits for our children and their schools, 
for citizen scientists and anyone interested in looking up at the sky 
through a different pair of ""eyes"". By contributing to this project, you
 will have the gratitude of CAST Astro Sciences and everyone that will 
be able to access this array, access new areas of STEM science, receive 
education in a field of science never before accessible to them, and be 
able to do scientific research, either on their own projects or in any 
number of citizen science projects.</p>
<p>If you find this project interesting, or know someone who 
would, if you know children who's school could benefit from access to 
this array, please forward the link to this Indiegogo campaign to them 
and let them know about it, thank you.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br/><b>All school &amp; observation package donations guarantee first access to the radio telescope interferometry baseline array.

output which is one component of the Fourier transform
 of the spatial distribution of the brightness of the observed object,
 the Fourier transform is a mathematical transformation that we use to 
transform signals between time, or spatial, domain and frequency domain,
 it is reversible, being able to transform from either domain to the 
other.  The image of the astronomical object is produced from these 
measurements.  This link provides basic information about radio telescope interferometry:  Guide to InterferometryIt is this combination of enhanced angular resolution and
 ability to combine smaller radio dishes to act as a unified larger 
radio 
telescope that makes interferometry such an important aspect of 
radio astronomy, the enhanced signal collection and data analysis this 
provides us, provides greater detail about the objects in our solar 
system and within our Universe.This is a tool that 
has never before been available to schools, for them to learn a new 
field of science, hands-on, and to explore the different physical 
properties and aspects of astronomical objects that optical telescopes 
can not see. The ability to explore a black hole, such as the SMBH at 
the centre of our galaxy (Sgr A*), and see it in greater detail for 
themselves, having done the research that collected that data 
themselves, is an exciting aspect that many of us would have liked for 
ourselves, but were never provided that opportunity to learn different 
aspects of those sciences that would make that possible, to involve 
ourselves directly with doing work in those scientific aspects, to 
explore the Universe in a whole new 
way.    

 Why not contribute to making that a possibility for the children in the
 schools of today? To expanding their horizons with new concepts in a 
future where science has an ever growing importance, to allow them to 
relive many of our childhood dream's of looking out at the stars, but 
through the radio spectrum with a radio telescope, instead of through 
the eyepiece of an optical telescope? 
The other benefit is that this provides amateur 
astronomers, 
citizen scientists and any member of the public interested in exploring 
astronomical objects through the method of radio astronomy, the 
opportunity to access the radio 
interferometer baseline array for their own research using a scientific 
research grade tool, 
never before available to them. While some amateur astronomers 
may have access to a self built radio telescope, none have had access to
 a scientifically viable radio interferometer baseline array for greater
 research capabilities. To expand upon their research interests with 
greater signal cohesion, angular resolution, image synthesis, spectral 
analysis, to explore in greater detail, their objects of interest 
through
 multi-wavelength capability. Supporting this 
project provides multiple benefits for our children and their schools, 
for citizen scientists and anyone interested in looking up at the sky 
through a different pair of ""eyes"". By contributing to this project, you
 will have the gratitude of CAST Astro Sciences and everyone that will 
be able to access this array, access new areas of STEM science, receive 
education in a field of science never before accessible to them, and be 
able to do scientific research, either on their own projects or in any 
number of citizen science projects.
If you find this project interesting, or know someone who 
would, if you know children who's school could benefit from access to 
this array, please forward the link to this Indiegogo campaign to them 
and let them know about it, thank you.All school & observation package donations guarantee first access to the radio telescope interferometry baseline array. Due to the increasing interest in this array, there will likely be a waiting period before you are able to schedule your observational time, so the packages purchased through this campaign guarantee the first observational sessions available on the array and optical telescope. June 08th, 2014 Update:There is limited time left on funding this array.This is an amazing resource as it has never been offered to schools, students and the public before and at such a massive savings. A typical, single, 3m radio telescope from the professional manufacturers costs in excess of £23,000. We are providing 5 dishes for £30,000!We have arranged for a discount on some of the engineering costs, allowing us to add an additional 3m radio dish to this array, making it a 6 dish radio telescope interferometer baseline array capable of even greater scientific research and educational projects.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

Our goals are teach photography and empower our students to communicate visually. We want our students to come away able to use photography to advocate for themselves, their families and their neighbors. We will be teaching them skills which will help them succeed in the modern South African economy. By supporting our venture you can be part of this process.<br/><br/>

We will initially be in Kliptown for a week and will run a photography workshop  at the Kliptown Youth Program. The workshop has been developed by an American photographer who will be assisted by three dynamic young  African photographers. With your financial support we will be able to provide digital equipment which would otherwise be unavailable to the students. We will teach them how to publish their photos to blogs and websites.<br/><br/>

We believe that learning photography is a way to foster creativity and connection. The students will gain skills as they learn to take photographs, publish photos online, exhibit their work, and become powerful voices for their community. You can connect with them by helping us buy cameras, pay for teachers, and fund exhibitions of their work.<br/><br/>

The cameras you help us buy will remain with the Kliptown Youth Program so they may continue this initiative when the workshop is completed.<br/><br/>

Exhibitions of the photographs taken by the students and their teachers are planned for both South Africa and the United States. By helping us fund these exhibits, you will allow the students to realize the full potential of their work, both economically and as social capital. And you will help them generate funds for their community.<br/><br/>

We are currently raising funds to run the photography workshop in Kliptown the first week of July, 2014. We are also raising money to cover the costs of mounting both exhibitions in Soweto and Pittsburgh, respectively. But right now, we need to purchase equipment and pay salaries. By donating to our project you will be helping the students from a neglected  and impoverished community get started on a path to creativity, entrepreneurship, and advocacy.<br/><br/>

All of us together—you as a donor, us as facilitators, the photography teachers, and the students—can all work together to develop a photography program at the  <a href=""http://www.kliptownyouthprogram.org.za/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kliptown Youth Program</a>, which will empower everyone involved and generate funds for the Youth Program. This is a small program with a big impact and your support is crucial to its success.<br/><br/></p><h3>What Does Your Money Pay For?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>CAMERAS</strong><br/>We will be teaching 12 high school aged students who live in Kliptown.

In this way, your money is not a one-time gift. Our greatest hope is that the project will remain sustainable under the guidance of the staff at the KYP, and we will be working with them to ensure that this happens. One aim of our project is to train students so that they can set up an on-line gallery to continue to document their lives and share their stories with the world.</li>
<br/><li>
<strong>LOCAL INSTRUCTORS</strong><br/>We have four instructors who will be teaching the week-long seminar. Our lead instructor, Heather Mull, is donating her time and expertise. However, we feel strongly that our local photographers (Jerry, Patrick and Tila) will provide an invaluable service to our students and should be paid for their time and work. The unemployment rate in South Africa hovers around 25% and among black South Africans, the unemployment rate is closer to 70%. We are honored to be able to employ three talented, passionate photographers for the week.</li>
<br/><li>
<strong>MEALS FOR OUR STUDENTS</strong><br/>For the week of our workshop, we will be providing both breakfast and lunch for our students. Many of the residents of Kliptown skip meals or go an entire day without eating. We want our students working at their best.</li>

<br/><li>
<strong>CREATIVE AND TECHNICAL SKILLS</strong><br/>
During our week-long seminar, our students will learn the elements of photography, not the least of which is to build a comfort level simply using otherwise unavailable digital equipment. The students will learn some fundamentals of shooting interiors, photographing portraits, and capturing social issues.</li>
<br/><li>
<strong>EXPERIENCE WORKING WITH DIGITAL CONTENT</strong><br/>We will also be teaching the students how to work on online platforms, to upload photographs and create web-pages so they may continue to share their world with the rest of the world.</li>
<br/><li>
<strong>A PLATFORM FOR NEW STORYTELLERS</strong><br/>
One of the purposes of the Kliptown Youth Program is to eradicate poverty of the mind, body and soul. The Photo Project has taken that as our mandate, as well. Beyond learning new marketable skills, beyond sharing their world with us, beyond raising money, our greatest hope is that our students will learn to value their own stories and know that their voices matter.</li>
</ul><p></p><br/><h3>Why Kliptown? </h3>
Kliptown is one of the original areas established during the 1903 relocation process, when the ruling British minority forcibly moved African and Indian mine workers to an area outside of Johannesburg. Kliptown is part of the much larger area of Soweto, and was originally known as Klipspruit (""klipspruit"" translates to ""rocky river"" in Afrikaans). The settlement was at that time nothing more than a squatters camp with the rocky river running through it.<br/><br/>

In post-apartheid South Africa, Kliptown itself has seen both major development and neglect. There have been over 1,000 units of affordable housing built near this site, yet there are also still 11 informal settlements or shantytowns in the area known as Kliptown.<br/><br/>

We are working in a large ""informal settlement,"" or shantytown, which has been in place since the 1940s. The settlement lacks basic municipal services (water, sewage, electricity, etc.) and struggles with issues of air pollution, illegal dumping, and water pollution. <br/><br/>

Families live with up to four generations in small homes made from corrugated tin, cardboard and other found materials. The students must leave the settlement to go to school. All residents must leave to obtain medical services and purchase food and goods.<br/><br/>

Despite such conditions, the community has been supported by initiatives like the Kliptown Youth Program. We hope that the Kliptown Photography Project can help foster similar support and growth.<p></p><p style=""font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.25em; letter-spacing: 0.03em;""><br/></p>

<p>NodePaint is a image editing and drawing software that uses a node based approach to give you unbelievable flexibility and free your creativity from technical issues. While the node based approach is not new, node based software until now is usually geared towards movie and TV post production. NodePaint is the first software that specializes in the tasks of image editing and image creation. Node based image software of today is either free but very limited in feature set, or costs several thousand dollars and still is not optimized for image creation. NodePaint tries to fill this gap.</p>
<p>I am developing several 2D games at the moment and I ended up needing a flexible image editor for Linux. There is not much out there at the moment and therefor I decided to make one myself.</p>
<p>After almost a year of hard work and a couple of rewrites because the chosen technology ran into problems, I finally have a stable and fast basic multicore node framework and I am starting to add the nodes now.</p>

Of course occasionally there will be features that take more then a week to develop, but 90% of the time you will see the application be filled with new functionality every week, you will be able to play around with it and give feedback about it to help further improve NodePaint.
Sponsors and sponsor links

About me
My name is Heiko Irrgang, I started developing games way back on the Commodore 64 and since then I spent all of my professional and a lot of my personal life developing all kind of things, including several open source projects, but also commercial games and applications. A node based image editing software was a long dream of mine and finally I have something to build upon. Thank you very much for taking the time to read this and I would really appreciate your help by supporting this project, no matter if financial, or by spreading the word in forums, in life and where ever you think it's appropriate.
Thank you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

What is Pocket Kitchen about?
Pocket Kitchen is a treasure trove of everything you need* to embark on the magical journey of creating miniature food sculptures from polymer clay. 





Head to ""What is in the Pocket Kitchen"" for specific descriptions of the items. But if you're wondering why would you need Pocket Kitchen in your life, just answer these two questions. 

One, do you love food? It extends beyond the mere act of eating - to hunting down the best steakhouse, Instagramming your beautifully plated dessert, or experimenting on pancake recipes. If you've done any of the above, then move on. Two, do you find it hard to stay focused at work or personal life?Possible scenarios include thinking about your next meal when you're writing a report on the computer, or being distracted by the tv while in a phone call. If it's a nod to both of these questions, then Pocket Kitchen will benefit you.How will Pocket Kitchen benefit me?With Pocket Kitchen, you are well equipped to start creating miniature food, inedible sculptures which will last for a lifetime.And miniature food crafting is a highly rewarding process. You get to observe details of the real food items you would like to recreate in miniature, take plenty of reference pictures and have a wonderful excuse to eat the reference subject in the end. After the creation process, you can display or wear the final products, an unique calorie-free way of exercising your love for food.
More importantly, it will make a positive impact on your focus skills.There is so much noise in our world today, with everything clawing for our attention. It's no wonder why attention deficiency is a serious issue in both kids and adults alike.

And this is what Pocket Kitchen can enable you to do.Miniature food crafting is about sitting down, and letting all your energies flow towards the polymer clay in front of you. I could be texturing a 'cake', putting on tiny decorations, rolling thin strands of 'noodles'.

From the start Allversity has been different from other educational platforms, here is why:<br/></p><ul>
<li>We partner with innovative non-profits to create courses about health, sustainable agriculture, human rights, and entrepreneurship.</li>
<li>We don't believe that people in poor communities should pay to learn basic skills that save lives or strengthen communities; this is why we work also with our partners to build free courses in professional development. </li>
<li>And from the start we have paid for this thing out of our own pockets, we are doing this because we want to make education work for more people in more places, not to make a buck.</li>
</ul><p>Our team believes that education is the key to building a future in which people around the world can live happier and healthier lives, while taking better care of each other and the planet.</p><p></p><p></p><h3>Why We Need Support</h3><p>Last Friday we were invited to attend Africa's largest eLearning conference in Kampala, which takes place in just TWO WEEKS!</p><p>The problem: we can't afford the transportation. </p><p>This invitation is a big deal as it is the perfect conference for us, in a country where we have already been doing a lot of work. Given this great opportunity, we want to make the most of it. So here is what we will be doing: </p><ol>
<li>Attending and moderating panels at eLearning Africa 2014, using the conference as a chance to connect with potential partners and sponsors.</li>
<li>Outside the conference we will be meeting with our new local partners from the Afrika Rise network in Uganda who want to use Allversity as a tool in their educational projects. We want to help them get started and see what we can do to improve access.</li>
<li>We will be talking with existing users about their educational needs, collecting information we can then transmit to our content-creating partners and their funders.</li>

From the start Allversity has been different from other educational platforms, here is why:
We partner with innovative non-profits to create courses about health, sustainable agriculture, human rights, and entrepreneurship.
We don't believe that people in poor communities should pay to learn basic skills that save lives or strengthen communities; this is why we work also with our partners to build free courses in professional development. 
And from the start we have paid for this thing out of our own pockets, we are doing this because we want to make education work for more people in more places, not to make a buck.
Our team believes that education is the key to building a future in which people around the world can live happier and healthier lives, while taking better care of each other and the planet.Why We Need SupportLast Friday we were invited to attend Africa's largest eLearning conference in Kampala, which takes place in just TWO WEEKS!The problem: we can't afford the transportation. This invitation is a big deal as it is the perfect conference for us, in a country where we have already been doing a lot of work. Given this great opportunity, we want to make the most of it. So here is what we will be doing: 
Attending and moderating panels at eLearning Africa 2014, using the conference as a chance to connect with potential partners and sponsors.
Outside the conference we will be meeting with our new local partners from the Afrika Rise network in Uganda who want to use Allversity as a tool in their educational projects. We want to help them get started and see what we can do to improve access.
We will be talking with existing users about their educational needs, collecting information we can then transmit to our content-creating partners and their funders.
And most importantly: learning from our students about what they need and want to learn.
The ImpactThis trip is a huge deal for our team, a chance to connect on the ground and build towards more locally-inspired learning materials on the site:
While on the ground Ysanne and Shane can collect data that will help us determine what materials need to be built for the site.
The trip allows us to connect with other organizations with similar goals who we can partner with to build or improve materials for our users.
Most importantly: this trip will help Allversity finally land the funding that will make it more effective at distributing materials.
Other Ways You Can HelpWe work in non-profit and know that sometimes you just don't have the money. But that is fine, our goal is small and more than anything we need people to spread the word, so:
Make some noise about this project and about Allversity: post us to your Facebook or Twitter. 
Forward our message to friends or family in an email.

The remaining $500 will be used for her Visa fee here in Madagascar, and expenses when she arrives in Oregon. Jemima received a scholarship for her registration fee, and her housing as well as transportation costs have already been generously donated. Though we hope to reach the goal of the full $3000, we will be able to use any amount of the money to help send Jemima to Oregon. 


A donation of $25 dollars or more will get you an email from Jemima, complete with photo of her at the conference! If you donate $100 or more, you will receive the email, as well as a postcard from Portland, Oregon!


Getting Jemima to Oregon to present her knowledge or English education to the world outside of Mahajanga will be one of the highlights of my Peace Corps experience, and I am sure it means much more to Jemima. 


As Nelson Mandela so eloquently said, ""Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world."" Please help Jemima change the world. 

If you want to help, but feel as though you just cannot donate at this time, please feel free to get the word out about Jemima and her wonderful opportunity. Share this on your FaceBook, Twitter, or any of the countless social media platforms we are all so connected to. Thank you Thank you!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign
