you already wondering where '<b><i>Upkwa</i></b>' is located on the world map
and who <b><i>'Akus' </i></b>are? My name is Buba Sulle Dicko. I am a teacher
in Government Secondary School Upkwa (GSS Upkwa), the lone secondary school with the highest enrollment of Aku
students in Cameroon. There are scores of girls attending this school thereby
breaking an age-old cultural barrier that relegated girls to the backyard. I am
also president of Aku Cultural and Development Association (ACUDA) founded in 2008
to give a voice to this highly under served community. Aku are a pastoral
community mostly found in Menchum and parts of Donga and Mantung divisions in
the north west Region of Cameroon. It is a community which has just begun
embracing secular education and still has the highest illiteracy level in
Cameroon. They settle in remote areas grazing their cattle with little or no access
to social amenities like schools, hospitals, potable water and electricity.  Put together, the Aku people constitute about 40%
of Menchum population (MINPLAPDAT 2001) with the lowest literacy
level. Women are the worst hit and only two girls (Hadija Haruna
and  Hajara) have ever reached high school in the close to 50 years
history of the Aku people in Menchum.<div>
<br/>
<p><b>WHERE IS UPKWA? </b></p>
<p><b>Upkwa
</b>is located some 8km north of Wum
town in Menchum division, North West Cameroon. It is a resettlement camp for
survivors of the 1986 Lake Nyos disaster which killed closed to 2.000 people including thousands of animals and birds. After
the disaster, a concentration of Aku people were resettled in Upkwa where they
have taken to subsistence farming as a new way of survival. In 1992, the government built a
primary school in the area to provide education for their children as a way of bringing them out of poverty. In
2011, a community effort led to the creation of a secondary school in the area (GSS
Upkwa). Today, the school has a steady growing enrollment and many girls have the
opportunity to attend school. About 80% of students in the school wouldn't have been in school if this school wasn't opened as the distance to the next school is too great. </p>
<p>However, one of the major setbacks to effective learning in the school is the lack of electricity and computers to teach computer science. Computer science is a core subject taught in
all government schools in Cameroon and taken at end of course official examination (GCE
Ordinary Level). Lack of both electricity and computers deprive students of this school the ability to compete with students of other schools. Cameroon's lone electricity company, <b>SONEL</b>, cannot extend electricity to the area because there
is no clientele. The inhabitants are poor farmers struggling to emerge from the
disaster of 1986. <br/></p>
<p>About 400 meters north of GSS Upkwa is the Upkwa integrated health center.This
health unit serves some 3,000 people in the communities of Upkwa, Sangwa,
Ngoh, Echuon and Karakara which surround Upkwa. This hospital runs on
a generator to carryout diagnosis; when there is no gas available, darkness fills the center at night causing work to become difficult if not impossible. To create a solution, families bring bush lamps to look after their sick ones at night. Lack of electricity hinders work in the hospital and patients sometimes trek long distances to either Wum District Hospital or other suffering from excruciating pain along the way while others are unable to reach the hospital in time. Paying for fuel to run the generator in the health unit has remained a hurdle to the community.  </p>
<p>Therefore, there is a felt need to solve the energy and computer problems in both institutions which are just a few meters apart. This solution is what this project seeks to put in place with your support. Therefore, supporting this project means boosting education and health of the Aku community and bringing them out of the darkness of ignorance, illiteracy, poverty and above all rampant human rights abuses by people who have been exploited for their ignorance...</p>
<p><b>WHAT THIS PROJECT INTENDS TO DO. </b><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
</tr></tbody>
</table>
<p>The project seeks to put in place a
viable solar energy plant of 1000kw capacity to supply regular energy to <b>both
institutions. For the school this means</b> <b>purchasing and installing 10 computers in GSS Upkwa, one printer, one photocopier
and an internet wireless network to ease learning in GSS Upkwa. Where as for the health center, lights and equipment will be available for the doctor and nurse to use during the night as well as for families as they care for their loved ones. Give jobs to engineers from the community who will then care for the solar panels.</b></p>
<p><b>ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS</b></p>
<p>The environmental condition of Upkwa provides a conducive environment for the effective installation and
working of solar energy and wireless internet. Upkwa is an open land with no winds and less trees and much sunshine. The average temperature in Cameroon ranges from 20 C to 28 C or 72 F to 88 F preventing any concern of snow or extreme heat which is faced elsewhere in the world. It is the only way to bring
development closer to the people and boost computer education in this highly
needed school which is gateway for development in the Aku community.</p>
<p>With
your support, we are sure to succeed in this project and bring the Aku community to the limelight of development.  Wouldn't  it be glorious to have your name inscribed in the
niche of history as one who changed the future of a generation of suffering
people? What if your name remains boldly smiling across the street from the walls of GSS Upkwa? Isn't it a rewarding idea to support an effort geared towards giving
meaning to the lives of a disaster stricken people? Of course it will. So, what are you waiting for? Be the first to set the pace for a project which will open a new horizon for a people struggling to emerge from darkness. <b>Be the FIRST candle to melt out in order to dispel darkness and lit other candles!!! </b><br/></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary Are
you already wondering where 'Upkwa' is located on the world map
and who 'Akus' are? My name is Buba Sulle Dicko. I am a teacher
in Government Secondary School Upkwa (GSS Upkwa), the lone secondary school with the highest enrollment of Aku
students in Cameroon. There are scores of girls attending this school thereby
breaking an age-old cultural barrier that relegated girls to the backyard. I am
also president of Aku Cultural and Development Association (ACUDA) founded in 2008
to give a voice to this highly under served community. Aku are a pastoral
community mostly found in Menchum and parts of Donga and Mantung divisions in
the north west Region of Cameroon. It is a community which has just begun
embracing secular education and still has the highest illiteracy level in
Cameroon. They settle in remote areas grazing their cattle with little or no access
to social amenities like schools, hospitals, potable water and electricity.  Put together, the Aku people constitute about 40%
of Menchum population (MINPLAPDAT 2001) with the lowest literacy
level. Women are the worst hit and only two girls (Hadija Haruna
and  Hajara) have ever reached high school in the close to 50 years
history of the Aku people in Menchum.

WHERE IS UPKWA? 
Upkwa
is located some 8km north of Wum
town in Menchum division, North West Cameroon. It is a resettlement camp for
survivors of the 1986 Lake Nyos disaster which killed closed to 2.000 people including thousands of animals and birds. After
the disaster, a concentration of Aku people were resettled in Upkwa where they
have taken to subsistence farming as a new way of survival. In 1992, the government built a
primary school in the area to provide education for their children as a way of bringing them out of poverty. In
2011, a community effort led to the creation of a secondary school in the area (GSS
Upkwa). Today, the school has a steady growing enrollment and many girls have the
opportunity to attend school. About 80% of students in the school wouldn't have been in school if this school wasn't opened as the distance to the next school is too great. 
However, one of the major setbacks to effective learning in the school is the lack of electricity and computers to teach computer science. Computer science is a core subject taught in
all government schools in Cameroon and taken at end of course official examination (GCE
Ordinary Level). Lack of both electricity and computers deprive students of this school the ability to compete with students of other schools. Cameroon's lone electricity company, SONEL, cannot extend electricity to the area because there
is no clientele. The inhabitants are poor farmers struggling to emerge from the
disaster of 1986. 
About 400 meters north of GSS Upkwa is the Upkwa integrated health center.This
health unit serves some 3,000 people in the communities of Upkwa, Sangwa,
Ngoh, Echuon and Karakara which surround Upkwa. This hospital runs on
a generator to carryout diagnosis; when there is no gas available, darkness fills the center at night causing work to become difficult if not impossible. To create a solution, families bring bush lamps to look after their sick ones at night. Lack of electricity hinders work in the hospital and patients sometimes trek long distances to either Wum District Hospital or other suffering from excruciating pain along the way while others are unable to reach the hospital in time. Paying for fuel to run the generator in the health unit has remained a hurdle to the community.  
Therefore, there is a felt need to solve the energy and computer problems in both institutions which are just a few meters apart. This solution is what this project seeks to put in place with your support. Therefore, supporting this project means boosting education and health of the Aku community and bringing them out of the darkness of ignorance, illiteracy, poverty and above all rampant human rights abuses by people who have been exploited for their ignorance...
WHAT THIS PROJECT INTENDS TO DO. 








The project seeks to put in place a
viable solar energy plant of 1000kw capacity to supply regular energy to both
institutions. For the school this means purchasing and installing 10 computers in GSS Upkwa, one printer, one photocopier
and an internet wireless network to ease learning in GSS Upkwa. Where as for the health center, lights and equipment will be available for the doctor and nurse to use during the night as well as for families as they care for their loved ones. Give jobs to engineers from the community who will then care for the solar panels.
ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS
The environmental condition of Upkwa provides a conducive environment for the effective installation and
working of solar energy and wireless internet. Upkwa is an open land with no winds and less trees and much sunshine. The average temperature in Cameroon ranges from 20 C to 28 C or 72 F to 88 F preventing any concern of snow or extreme heat which is faced elsewhere in the world. It is the only way to bring
development closer to the people and boost computer education in this highly
needed school which is gateway for development in the Aku community.
With
your support, we are sure to succeed in this project and bring the Aku community to the limelight of development.  Wouldn't  it be glorious to have your name inscribed in the
niche of history as one who changed the future of a generation of suffering
people? What if your name remains boldly smiling across the street from the walls of GSS Upkwa? Isn't it a rewarding idea to support an effort geared towards giving
meaning to the lives of a disaster stricken people? Of course it will. So, what are you waiting for? Be the first to set the pace for a project which will open a new horizon for a people struggling to emerge from darkness. Be the FIRST candle to melt out in order to dispel darkness and lit other candles!!!

“There is no more powerful way to uphold the vision of a future free from conflict than by keeping schools running.” ~ Gordon Brown WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO? 
It’s simple:  Donate and tell your friends and family about our #BuildCampaign.  By spreading the word you become eligible to join our referral campaign.  When your network donates you could possibly win a trip to Uganda or an iPad mini 3.Here is how you can be entered to win a trip to Uganda for our 2016 Groundbreaking Ceremony: 

Through our referral campaign, you can win a chance to be in Uganda alongside us for
this momentous milestone.

     You can use the social media buttons, but also the Link button to generate
     your unique link that points to this page.We will track each time you share the campaign with these links!


Important!  To qualify - your network must donate at least $150 collectively and share on social media. We must reach our fundraising goal of $250,000.  
     So spread the word as far and wide as you can so we can get
     started!

     Every person who clicks on your link gets you closer to being with us in
     Uganda!


Visit our website for more details about the trip and other ways to be
entered into the drawing.  
NO QUESTION OR CONCERN WILL GO UNANSWERED!


Why the $50,000 goal?
This
is NOT our real goal, of course, but we didn't want to scare you. A quality classroom can be built for $25,000, but a full service top-tier school requires a good deal more.  At the Shule Foundation, we are dedicated to building schools, not just classrooms. Every dollar raised will go towards completing our first campus and providing every student and teacher with everything they need to succeed:dormitories ● indoor plumbing ● electricity ● modern
science and computer labs ● community library ● classrooms ● computers ●
tablets ● textbooks ● internet ● infirmary ● dining hall ● teacher's salary ● teacher
housing ● sports facility ● farming equipment ● livestock ● and so much more...How much money from this campaign actually goes to build the schools?  With
the exception of IndieGoGo/PayPal fees and shipping of the perks, every dollar
will go to building our first school in Uganda.  If we raise more than we
need for our first school, the additional funds will go to the building of our second school, as we
do not plan on stopping at just one. There are too many children in sub-Saharan Africa with
great potential that need access to a quality educational experience. Will you update me on the progress of the project?   Of
course! At every stage of the building as well as when the school is opened, we
will send you status updates including photos and videos. What payment methods do you accept?
We accept Pay Pal and major credit cards. If you want to pay by check just contact us directly and we will provide you with our mailing address.
Can I donate from anywhere in the world? For sure!
When will I get my gift?  If you qualified for a t-shirt you will get it once
the campaign is over.  You will receive photos of your engraved brick once
construction is complete.  Please make sure to let us know if you change
your e-mail at anytime. We don’t want you to miss out.  
Is shipping included in the perks?
Yes.
Is my contribution tax deductible?
Yes.How can I join you in Uganda for the groundbreaking ceremony? Please visit our #buildcampaign page to learn more. http://shulefoundation.org/buildcampaign/I have another question...Please post any questions as a comment (see the comments tab in the top menu), and we will respond as soon as we can.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Crowdsourced Scientific Research</h3>
<p>Co-Lab hosts an open-database of scientific experiments from which users are financially incentivized to make observations, ask questions, and form hypotheses:</p>

<li>
<strong>85% of biomedical research funding is wasted</strong> due to the out-dated infrastructure of scientific research.</li>
<li>Co-Lab was founded by Patrick Joyce, a medical student at Georgetown University who left a PhD program in molecular biology because of the job market for academic researchers.</li>
<li>We want to create an open-access, transparent, and conflict-of-interest-free online marketplace for contributions to scientific research. <ul>
<li>
<strong>Open-Access</strong> - All content will be published under a Creative Commons 4.0 license to increase exposure. Anyone, anywhere can learn from or contribute to Co-Lab.</li>

<h3>Why Co-Lab Needs Crowdsourced Funding</h3>
<p>We're asking for your help to develop Co-Lab's fully functional platform because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our founder is a student who has developed Co-Lab's MVP using his own personal funds.</li>
<li>Crowdfunding the full platform will allow us to build Co-Lab without introducing a financial conflict-of-interest.</li>

<h3><strong>Where Will the Funding Go?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>​</strong>The funding from this campaign will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Optimizing and scaling Co-Lab</strong> for adoption as a collaborative tool for academic researchers who understand the value of open-science and want to share their data and involve the general public in their research workflows.</li>

<h3>The Impact of Crowdsourced Science</h3>
<p>Using the scientific method as a format for academic debate will incentivize a more diverse, healthy, and productive scientific community:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Diverse</strong> - Access to a career in science for those who are currently socioeconomically excluded .</li>
<li>
<strong>Healthy</strong> - Direct financial compensation of posts gets rid of the economic need for intellectual property or copyright restrictions. </li>
<li>
<strong>Productive</strong> - Observations, questions, and hypotheses are modular ""micro""-research outputs that are easy for both academically trained and citizen scientists to use. The result is a <strong>financial incentive for scientific literacy</strong> among the general public.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This will not be an easy path. There are significant hurdles along the way that we can only overcome as a united, collaborative scientific community:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Objectivity </strong>- The algorithms used by Co-Lab to curate and financially compensate content are incredibly important to the success of this project. In the interest of transparency and fairness we will utilize formula's derived from community-consensus designed to achieve measurable outcomes and minimize bias.</li>
<li>
<strong>Adoption</strong> - Many in the scientific community have overcome incredible odds to find success in the current system and are understandably resistant to change. Co-Lab's success will be dependent on <strong>early adopters and their ability to provide objective proof</strong> of the utility of crowdsourced scientific research. </li>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What is Co-Lab's Revenue Model?</h3>
<p>Co-Lab sources grant-funding from patrons of scientific research, collects <strong>a community-approved variable administration fee ranging from 0.1-3%</strong>, and then distributes the remainder of the capital to its users based on a social-consensus algorithm. </p>
<p>Currently, funding organizations spend ~5% of their budgets administering research grants to achieve an estimated 15% return on investment. By harnessing the wisdom of the crowd, Co-Lab presents funders of scientific research with a drastically improved ROI. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Sultan Akif and I am the founder of ‘Library in a Week’ project (<a href=""http://www.libraryinaweek.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.libraryinaweek.com</a>). I left a successful, 17 years career, as a global executive with organizations like Microsoft and IBM to follow my dream of empowering youths. After building one of the largest youth empowerment annual events in Canada, it is now my mission to illuminate the far corners of the planet with the brilliance of knowledge; one library at a time. To give those that are left behind the tools to succeed and the power to dream. Connecting with my passion has been one of the best life decisions for me and you can read the full story here.</p>
<p>The mission of Library in a Week project is to make 100 libraries around the world in a way that drives real sustainable change - our project brings together the community to build the library rather than rely solely on external organizations. Our method is agile, cost effective and has a real impact! A key focus on my 17 years corporate career was to create large reusable solutions and land them globally; little did I realize that I was learning a very specific skill-set for something much bigger in life! I went to Nepal this summer to write my book on a very different topic – the transformation of my career from technology to youth empowerment. In an exciting series of events, I truly connected with my purpose and built two libraries. I libraries were completed in 4 days each in Katmandu, Nepal and Tal, Nepal. Tal in particular was a major undertaking as this remote village of 200 is deep in the Himalayas, only accessible by 5 days of walk or a treacherous 7 hours jeep ride from the nearest road. We just completed our third library in the Amazon jungle (video here <a href=""https://youtu.be/ynHZOwfqKfg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://youtu.be/ynHZOwfqKfg</a>) and will be completing our fourth in Mexico in November.</p>
<p>This campaign is to raise funds to build our fifth library close to Merzouga Morocco in the Sahara Desert in December. We plan to complete the project by the first week of January.</p>
<p>If we are able to accumulate additional funds, they will go towards building our next library in Panama City or a similar location.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We have the capability to deliver these libraries very quickly. the only thing holding us back are funds. Your contributions will accelerate out ability to make an impact.</p>
<p>In return, you will be recognized both in the library and in the video footage that will be captured of the build. If you have a business, we can do specific shout-outs to your brand for increased market awareness.</p>

My name is Sultan Akif and I am the founder of ‘Library in a Week’ project (www.libraryinaweek.com). I left a successful, 17 years career, as a global executive with organizations like Microsoft and IBM to follow my dream of empowering youths. After building one of the largest youth empowerment annual events in Canada, it is now my mission to illuminate the far corners of the planet with the brilliance of knowledge; one library at a time. To give those that are left behind the tools to succeed and the power to dream. Connecting with my passion has been one of the best life decisions for me and you can read the full story here.
The mission of Library in a Week project is to make 100 libraries around the world in a way that drives real sustainable change - our project brings together the community to build the library rather than rely solely on external organizations. Our method is agile, cost effective and has a real impact! A key focus on my 17 years corporate career was to create large reusable solutions and land them globally; little did I realize that I was learning a very specific skill-set for something much bigger in life! I went to Nepal this summer to write my book on a very different topic – the transformation of my career from technology to youth empowerment. In an exciting series of events, I truly connected with my purpose and built two libraries. I libraries were completed in 4 days each in Katmandu, Nepal and Tal, Nepal. Tal in particular was a major undertaking as this remote village of 200 is deep in the Himalayas, only accessible by 5 days of walk or a treacherous 7 hours jeep ride from the nearest road. We just completed our third library in the Amazon jungle (video here https://youtu.be/ynHZOwfqKfg) and will be completing our fourth in Mexico in November.
This campaign is to raise funds to build our fifth library close to Merzouga Morocco in the Sahara Desert in December. We plan to complete the project by the first week of January.
If we are able to accumulate additional funds, they will go towards building our next library in Panama City or a similar location.

What We Need & What You Get
We have the capability to deliver these libraries very quickly. the only thing holding us back are funds. Your contributions will accelerate out ability to make an impact.
In return, you will be recognized both in the library and in the video footage that will be captured of the build. If you have a business, we can do specific shout-outs to your brand for increased market awareness.

<p>Hemp is by far the most versatile plant we have. If we utilise it, we can replace wood paper, GM cotton, petrochemical plastics, concrete and other toxic building materials which are destroying our environment and our health. Hemp can restore our health, the soil, the environment and the economy.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hemp is not new; in fact it has been used as a crop for over 10,000 years. Unfortunately, hemp has many barriers, mainly due to it being part of the cannabis family. Hemp is non-psychoactive and has more than 25,000 commercial uses. Other strains of cannabis have been used for thousands of years as a medicine and it is time that these truths are known and utilised.</p>

Hawaiian Airlines Award Winning HanaHou magazine, Puppen Speilzig in Germany and many other magazines from around the world have featured me and my work for years now.  I own my own gallery on the North Shore of Oahu in the famous surf town of Haleiwa.  See video below or Check out my website at <a href=""http://www.BoBergemann.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.BoBergemann.com</a>.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/elreUR68aXM?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p><strong>Important &amp; Realistic Goals:</strong></p><p>My sincere hope is to use these truly unique patent pending dolls to meet three goals.   I will move through the following goals in sequential order as time, energy and funding is made available to do so. </p><p>1) Produce &amp; Deliver a valuable educational tool (ASL Educational Tool Version DOLLS) to qualified therapists and teachers to help them teach ASL to young children in need in a hands on fun and interactive way.</p><p>2) Produce and offer an affordable, child safety tested, actual toy version ASL doll to be enjoyed in the homes of the deaf, hard of hearing and others who may benefit, like autistic children who do not speak and other non-verbal people (with various underlying causes of their being unable to speak).  If a child can not vocalize but can use their hands, ASL will work for them! </p><p>3)Raise ASL understanding and awareness toward it's more generalized incorporation in US society in general.  I hope these will help educate the public, raising awareness of the need for effective ASL instruction and immersion education throughout the USA and wherever the deaf, hard of hearing and non-verbal live.  For example: I'm hoping all states will begin Incorporating at least one ASL immersive special ed classroom and instructor into at least one school in each community ASAP as a result of serious reconsideration of needs for ASL instruction.  If this really takes off as I hope.  Then I hope it will spawn more people to champion making such opportunities a reality in every community in the USA.  Finally, I firmly believe ASL Dolls can be enjoyed by hearing toddlers too since most are only partially verbal.  Interactive role play with ASL dolls will actually heightened any toddler's later success in communication including such subjects in school as writing (a real struggle point in education in the US today.)</p><p>Raising a child with the challenges being deaf can create is expensive in time, energy and money. I know.  I've worked hard at my career in order to help make sure our daughter has every advantage at her disposal. She is blessed to have many opportunities that so many do not have, simply because my husband and I have been able to work very hard, save hard and make sacrifices to obtain these opportunities for her.  We both work 90+ hour weeks regularly.  I have also homeschooled her for much of her schooling because the opportunities for her to meet her own potential where we lived when she was growing up were sub par or non-existent.  A sad truth in many places in the USA Today.  I'm grateful the opportunities she needs now are available here where we live in California although it has cost our family dearly to make this move in order for this to happen for her.  She is worth it!</p><p>But, I know many families are not able to do the same for many and various <u>good</u> reasons.  I also know that as much as I long to be able to, our family simply can not afford to move this project forward any further completely on our own at this time. </p><p>I've done as much as I can afford to put the time, energy and money into at this point entirely on my own out of love and longing to help others.  I will carry on in every way it's possible for me to do so in my passion to help those in need.  Just to be clear, my own daughter is long past the communication stages these dolls are meant to help teach.  Yet, I've poured a year of my life in addition to tens of thousands of dollars into this project to get it this far.  Now, I realize it's time I simply must ask for others who are willing and able, to help me take this project to fruition.</p><p><strong>Next Steps Needed . . . We have a preliminary prototype!</strong></p><p>I created a preliminary prototype in the form of an original fine art doll using a resin BJD created entirely by me as my medium.  You can learn more, see photos and video of this original fine art doll in action and get more info. on all of this by watching the 10 minute video below which has a lot more to it than the mini video at the top of this campaign.</p><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/MeC2xz7USx8?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p><strong>What We Need Now...</strong></p><p>My goals are lofty and come with a price tag to match.  But, every little bit will help us move toward our goals because I am not one to give up easily when I'm passionate about something.  </p><p><strong>Progress toward Goal #1: </strong> I am doing more work on my preliminary prototype to add changing face plates for expressive faces since facial expression is a huge part of American Sign Language communication.  This will result in the educational and therapeutic tool once every additional part needed is complete to include the 20+ words and letters the doll can already express plus keywords like Who, What, When, Where, Why &amp; How, all the vowels, top 10 key consonants for early spelling and another 10+ early conversational word hand shapes.  Once this next more advanced prototype is designed and complete, it should be very close to the educational therapeutic tool we hope to offer ready for production.</p><p><strong>Progress toward Goal #2 &amp; 3 will be dependent on first meeting goal #1.  </strong></p><p>The toy version doll is a whole other story, but one I believe needs to be told.  The bottom line is toys can become trends and trends sincerely effect the entire population.  My earnest hope is to create and offer a toy doll that will become a trend such that over the next decade every household in the USA will be learning ""basic simple conversational and emergency needs"" words commonly used in American Sign Language!  This would of course make a huge impact on goal #3!</p><p>USA Toy Testing standards must be met which are expensive.  Molds for vinyl doll pieces and parts are in the tens of thousands per piece.  This doll will have 23 pieces to make up the fully jointed body, add the back of the head and at least 3 expressive face plates and 25+ hands, will mean over 50 molds at thousands of dollars each!   Plastic may be a better &amp; more affordable medium via new 3d printing tech. I'm looking into all of it now. Either route will be used to bring down end per piece costs to a point at which most Americans can afford such dolls for their children.  Now you know why I'd love for an angel investor to jump in to support this cause!</p><p>Any amount you can spare will help bring this project to fruition.  I will simply proceed as funding comes in for each step forward to be completed.  If you can give $5 and tell your friends about our campaign here, you will be a huge help to whom we, and those who will be truly helped by these,  will be grateful!</p><p>I'm hoping to raise the $775,000 needed to successfully and quickly meet goals 1 &amp; 2 for limited initial offerings large enough to make them affordable.  The higher number of product in an initial run, though it may be more expensive to set up, results in the eventual per piece costs going down. </p><p><strong>Impact. . .</strong></p><p>I honestly believe there is a real market in the USA for the toy version with ALL children even those who can hear since learning ASL as a baby and toddler actually increases brain connections and communication potential making for little ones who get along better and have a real advantage in education throughout their lives.  In fact, I believe the entire USA education system should be looking to use ASL in head start programs because then I believe kids who are at risk will become kids who are exceeding potential!</p><p>Obviously this project has far greater ramifications and long term potential than there is time or space to discuss here.  In time, every deaf and hard of hearing child as well as autistic and other non-verbal children could be able to easily readily obtain their own doll if this all works out as well as I sincerely hope!  Hearing babies &amp; toddlers and their parents who want to communicate with them better will want a beautiful doll to help them learn ASL, gaining brain connections early that will help throughout their education as well.  All while simply playing dolls!  Wonderful stop motion videos and role play videos could be made to add to teaching potential as well.  Then, we can up production to bring down per piece pricing over time.  ASL is actually fast becoming THE sign language used in many countries besides the USA.  It is also the 4th most studied language in the USA.  However, we could also make BSL (British Sign Language) and other country versions in time as well.</p><p>In the meantime, looking at goal #3 Raising ASL Awareness in US culture, I sincerely hope this campaign and the next steps after it will help expand the American people's awareness and understanding of the key that ASL truly is to potential for the deaf and <strong>non-verbal</strong> people of this world.  Including everyone's own babies and toddlers!  </p><p>ASL has potential to open up a world of communication and connection for so many!  Cochlear implants are not necessarily the answer, as we ourselves found out.  Without going into too much detail here, suffice it to say putting a cochlear implant on a deaf person can sometimes be very much like putting glasses on a blind person.  There is so much more to it than simple mechanics and digital solutions can actually make up for.  Visual education in an ASL and congruent spoken language immersion program is truly the answer here.</p><p><strong>Other ways to help . . .</strong></p><p><strong>​1) Check out <a href=""http://www.BoBergemann.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.BoBergemann.com</a></strong> to see a very special offer to purchase an original artist doll named Alice on pre-order now.  This doll will come with just a handful of ASL hand shapes like those shown in the video as my first stage preliminary prototype here to showcase how exactly this is all meant to work for those who want to see/touch/feel and try in person.   This Special Limited Edition Signed Artist Doll BJD Pre-Order will run contingent to this Indiegogo campaign and I will be donating a portion of my proceeds to this endeavor.  So, if you would like to buy a doll on pre-order now to be fulfilled next Spring please do so at <a href=""http://www.BoBergemann.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.BoBergemann.com</a>.  I have a flawless reputation for delivering on time as promised ALWAYS!  And in this case you will be purchasing through my own business website, so you will be a customer and have an order I will also fulfill on time as promised as I've done for 7 years straight now!</p><p>Something everyone can do to help is . . .</p><p>2) <strong>Please Share this campaign with others.  </strong>This first doll showcased here is named Alice after the little girl whose charming personality and intelligence inspired Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet to begin teaching her Sign Language which later lead to the start of the first ASL immersion school in America. That man cared sincerely for someone he was not even related to.  Please choose to do the same!</p><p>Please join with my daughter and I in the same spirit of caring and connection Thomas Hopkins Gauladet had that saw Alice's very real need to connect and communicate so he did something to meet it.  Please partner with us here today.<strong>  </strong></p><p>Every little bit, whether <strong>awareness is increased</strong> or <strong>funding is increased</strong>, helps!

 A lot has happened in the years since, but the journey to assist her to communicate and connect with the world is a demanding, continuing and ongoing process for us all.  At her request, she and I recently moved to Fremont, CA for her to be able to attend one of the nation's leading schools for the deaf.  It is an American Sign Language (ASL) immersion program.  She wanted to go there because she wanted to be with other kids who are also deaf and to be immersed in an ASL and visual learning environment.  The opportunities for her abound in this environment, so we are very grateful she is attending there now.  She is an A student and we are all very proud of her!  This is one of only a handful of such school in the USA doing a really great job for the deaf and hard of hearing today.Sadly, the opportunities for deaf children to learn and grow in ASL (American Sign Language) usage are far and few between in most other places nowadays.  Even in the USA of today.  American Sign Language and it's very real impact upon those who need it is far too misunderstood.  The resources are few.  The demand is spread out, not centralized, so no one is as aware of, nor well informed nor enabled as is truly needed, in my opinion from our own experience.I believe something as simple as a doll can make a huge difference!  Realizing the deficit between ASL educational opportunities and the real need in most communities in the USA Today, I decided to make an ASL doll.  Anyone can role play with and learn to communicate using such a doll.  Dolls can go into homes, workplaces, vehicles as well as educational and therapeutic environments where the children who need to learn ASL are.  Dolls are simple early developmental stage tools to teach both communication and connection.  Key reasons for American Sign Language to be taught to the deaf, hard of hearing, and other non-verbal children through dolls.Check out this brief video which shows the preliminary prototype in action!There is a longer video with more to it at the bottom of this campaign explanation.  Read on for more detailed facts.What Makes Me Think I Can Do This?I have been making dolls for 25 years.  I've run a successful business selling my fine art dolIs for 7 years now.  I also created my own award winning vinyl doll line known as Trendy & Swag which won Dolls Magazine's Industries Choice Play Doll of the year in 2015 & 2016 as well as People's Choice in the latter beating out others worldwide in the 18"" Play Doll category.  I designed, sculpted, produced, fulfilled and oversaw every aspect of this line.  So, I know the industry and have the skillset, connections and experience to make this happen.  Frankly, so do companies like AG or other well known doll companies.  But, I also have the desire to see this very real need of the deaf & non-verbal communities met.  These two factors work together to make me uniquely qualified for this project.If you would like to learn more about me and my qualifications, take a look at Dolls Magazine cover & feature article Oct 2017, or Stampington Art Dolls (both the current issue and the first one out in 2018 have articles on me now). Hawaiian Airlines Award Winning HanaHou magazine, Puppen Speilzig in Germany and many other magazines from around the world have featured me and my work for years now.  I own my own gallery on the North Shore of Oahu in the famous surf town of Haleiwa.  See video below or Check out my website at www.BoBergemann.com.Important & Realistic Goals:My sincere hope is to use these truly unique patent pending dolls to meet three goals.   I will move through the following goals in sequential order as time, energy and funding is made available to do so. 1) Produce & Deliver a valuable educational tool (ASL Educational Tool Version DOLLS) to qualified therapists and teachers to help them teach ASL to young children in need in a hands on fun and interactive way.2) Produce and offer an affordable, child safety tested, actual toy version ASL doll to be enjoyed in the homes of the deaf, hard of hearing and others who may benefit, like autistic children who do not speak and other non-verbal people (with various underlying causes of their being unable to speak).  If a child can not vocalize but can use their hands, ASL will work for them! 3)Raise ASL understanding and awareness toward it's more generalized incorporation in US society in general.  I hope these will help educate the public, raising awareness of the need for effective ASL instruction and immersion education throughout the USA and wherever the deaf, hard of hearing and non-verbal live.  For example: I'm hoping all states will begin Incorporating at least one ASL immersive special ed classroom and instructor into at least one school in each community ASAP as a result of serious reconsideration of needs for ASL instruction.  If this really takes off as I hope.  Then I hope it will spawn more people to champion making such opportunities a reality in every community in the USA.  Finally, I firmly believe ASL Dolls can be enjoyed by hearing toddlers too since most are only partially verbal.  Interactive role play with ASL dolls will actually heightened any toddler's later success in communication including such subjects in school as writing (a real struggle point in education in the US today.)Raising a child with the challenges being deaf can create is expensive in time, energy and money. I know.  I've worked hard at my career in order to help make sure our daughter has every advantage at her disposal. She is blessed to have many opportunities that so many do not have, simply because my husband and I have been able to work very hard, save hard and make sacrifices to obtain these opportunities for her.  We both work 90+ hour weeks regularly.  I have also homeschooled her for much of her schooling because the opportunities for her to meet her own potential where we lived when she was growing up were sub par or non-existent.  A sad truth in many places in the USA Today.  I'm grateful the opportunities she needs now are available here where we live in California although it has cost our family dearly to make this move in order for this to happen for her.  She is worth it!But, I know many families are not able to do the same for many and various good reasons.  I also know that as much as I long to be able to, our family simply can not afford to move this project forward any further completely on our own at this time. I've done as much as I can afford to put the time, energy and money into at this point entirely on my own out of love and longing to help others.  I will carry on in every way it's possible for me to do so in my passion to help those in need.  Just to be clear, my own daughter is long past the communication stages these dolls are meant to help teach.  Yet, I've poured a year of my life in addition to tens of thousands of dollars into this project to get it this far.  Now, I realize it's time I simply must ask for others who are willing and able, to help me take this project to fruition.Next Steps Needed . . . We have a preliminary prototype!I created a preliminary prototype in the form of an original fine art doll using a resin BJD created entirely by me as my medium.  You can learn more, see photos and video of this original fine art doll in action and get more info. on all of this by watching the 10 minute video below which has a lot more to it than the mini video at the top of this campaign.What We Need Now...My goals are lofty and come with a price tag to match.  But, every little bit will help us move toward our goals because I am not one to give up easily when I'm passionate about something.  Progress toward Goal #1:  I am doing more work on my preliminary prototype to add changing face plates for expressive faces since facial expression is a huge part of American Sign Language communication.  This will result in the educational and therapeutic tool once every additional part needed is complete to include the 20+ words and letters the doll can already express plus keywords like Who, What, When, Where, Why & How, all the vowels, top 10 key consonants for early spelling and another 10+ early conversational word hand shapes.  Once this next more advanced prototype is designed and complete, it should be very close to the educational therapeutic tool we hope to offer ready for production.Progress toward Goal #2 & 3 will be dependent on first meeting goal #1.  The toy version doll is a whole other story, but one I believe needs to be told.  The bottom line is toys can become trends and trends sincerely effect the entire population.  My earnest hope is to create and offer a toy doll that will become a trend such that over the next decade every household in the USA will be learning ""basic simple conversational and emergency needs"" words commonly used in American Sign Language!  This would of course make a huge impact on goal #3!USA Toy Testing standards must be met which are expensive.  Molds for vinyl doll pieces and parts are in the tens of thousands per piece.  This doll will have 23 pieces to make up the fully jointed body, add the back of the head and at least 3 expressive face plates and 25+ hands, will mean over 50 molds at thousands of dollars each!   Plastic may be a better & more affordable medium via new 3d printing tech. I'm looking into all of it now. Either route will be used to bring down end per piece costs to a point at which most Americans can afford such dolls for their children.  Now you know why I'd love for an angel investor to jump in to support this cause!Any amount you can spare will help bring this project to fruition.  I will simply proceed as funding comes in for each step forward to be completed.  If you can give $5 and tell your friends about our campaign here, you will be a huge help to whom we, and those who will be truly helped by these,  will be grateful!I'm hoping to raise the $775,000 needed to successfully and quickly meet goals 1 & 2 for limited initial offerings large enough to make them affordable.  The higher number of product in an initial run, though it may be more expensive to set up, results in the eventual per piece costs going down. Impact. . .I honestly believe there is a real market in the USA for the toy version with ALL children even those who can hear since learning ASL as a baby and toddler actually increases brain connections and communication potential making for little ones who get along better and have a real advantage in education throughout their lives.  In fact, I believe the entire USA education system should be looking to use ASL in head start programs because then I believe kids who are at risk will become kids who are exceeding potential!Obviously this project has far greater ramifications and long term potential than there is time or space to discuss here.  In time, every deaf and hard of hearing child as well as autistic and other non-verbal children could be able to easily readily obtain their own doll if this all works out as well as I sincerely hope!  Hearing babies & toddlers and their parents who want to communicate with them better will want a beautiful doll to help them learn ASL, gaining brain connections early that will help throughout their education as well.  All while simply playing dolls!  Wonderful stop motion videos and role play videos could be made to add to teaching potential as well.  Then, we can up production to bring down per piece pricing over time.  ASL is actually fast becoming THE sign language used in many countries besides the USA.  It is also the 4th most studied language in the USA.  However, we could also make BSL (British Sign Language) and other country versions in time as well.In the meantime, looking at goal #3 Raising ASL Awareness in US culture, I sincerely hope this campaign and the next steps after it will help expand the American people's awareness and understanding of the key that ASL truly is to potential for the deaf and non-verbal people of this world.  Including everyone's own babies and toddlers!  ASL has potential to open up a world of communication and connection for so many!  Cochlear implants are not necessarily the answer, as we ourselves found out.  Without going into too much detail here, suffice it to say putting a cochlear implant on a deaf person can sometimes be very much like putting glasses on a blind person.  There is so much more to it than simple mechanics and digital solutions can actually make up for.  Visual education in an ASL and congruent spoken language immersion program is truly the answer here.Other ways to help . . .​1) Check out www.BoBergemann.com to see a very special offer to purchase an original artist doll named Alice on pre-order now.  This doll will come with just a handful of ASL hand shapes like those shown in the video as my first stage preliminary prototype here to showcase how exactly this is all meant to work for those who want to see/touch/feel and try in person.   This Special Limited Edition Signed Artist Doll BJD Pre-Order will run contingent to this Indiegogo campaign and I will be donating a portion of my proceeds to this endeavor.  So, if you would like to buy a doll on pre-order now to be fulfilled next Spring please do so at www.BoBergemann.com.  I have a flawless reputation for delivering on time as promised ALWAYS!  And in this case you will be purchasing through my own business website, so you will be a customer and have an order I will also fulfill on time as promised as I've done for 7 years straight now!Something everyone can do to help is . . .2) Please Share this campaign with others.  This first doll showcased here is named Alice after the little girl whose charming personality and intelligence inspired Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet to begin teaching her Sign Language which later lead to the start of the first ASL immersion school in America. That man cared sincerely for someone he was not even related to.  Please choose to do the same!Please join with my daughter and I in the same spirit of caring and connection Thomas Hopkins Gauladet had that saw Alice's very real need to connect and communicate so he did something to meet it.  Please partner with us here today.  Every little bit, whether awareness is increased or funding is increased, helps!  So, even if you can't give now, share this to your FB page, your other social networks and maybe someone it reaches can!  In the end AWARENESS of a problem is key to the beginning of it's solution!  Everyone who sees this can share it which will help with goal #4 at the very least.Together, we can truly make a difference in the life of someone who might otherwise live a  separated and unnecessarily disconnected lonely life in which their own potential is simply never realized or even explored.  The fact this is still so prevalent in modern America today is truly sad and unacceptable.  Please join with us to make a real difference today!Mahalo,Bo Bergemann",1.0,4,"1 Campaign

<p>Frank Swai and Rev. Joshua laiser are the founders of Pambazuka Naisinyai School. The idea of starting Pambazuka Naisinyai School came to the mind of Frank and Joshua after seeing the challenges facing Maasai communities in Tanzania. Rev. Joshua is a Maasai by tribe and he was born and raised in the Maasai communities so he knows much about the challenges facing his communities.He says ""Education has been severe challenge in the Maasai communities as most of families don't know the importance of education for future life of their children. So we are working hard to educate parents and community in general so that they can know the importance of education. So the Pambazuka Naisinyai School is for Maasai children and nearby communities. Please join us and donate something to support this project!!</p>
<p><u><strong>Our School Started under the tree</strong></u></p>
<p>Our school started under the tree as we do not have resources to help us for building classes for the Maasai children. Education should start with their parents to educate them so that they can know the importance of education to their children. Some of the parents are now aware about education to their children so they are allowing them to attend school. We are still talking to the parents so that they can give us a good cooperation.</p>

<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>Early Marriage and circumcision for the young Maasai girls.</strong></u></p>
<p>Imagine a world where every child is educated and can contribute to the development process!!</p>
<p>So many times parents in Maasai  areas tend to give away their young girls for marriage in exchange for just a kilogram of sugar, a goat, a cow , some tea leaves and sometimes for salt. These young girls are then subjected to domestic violence, torture, early child birth and many times girls have died while giving birth because their bodies are never ready to experience child birth.</p>
<p>Many times the parents to these girls need to be empowered with information about the benefits of keeping their children in school until they complete their education. Once these girls have acquired the education, they can provide all the above mentioned items to their parents for the rest of their lives. All that parents need to to practice some bit of patience and sacrifice a little in order to enjoy the fruits of their children.</p>
<p>Circumcision for the women is prohibited but Maasai societies they still circumcise their young girls. We are working hard to educate them so that they can stop this.</p>
<p>Its time to reach out to the parents in the Maasai land settings and sensitize them if we want a better future for girls. A future where they can participate in leadership positions. A future where they can make informed choices and start up families the the men of their choice.</p>
<p>The time is now. Lets teach the Parents because they need this knowledge.</p>

<p><strong>Young Boys:</strong>  Young boys normally are send to keep cows and goats far away from home and come back evening everyday. Others they like to go to school but not allowed to go!!</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>Young Maasai Kids in the bush keeping cows</strong></i></p>
<p>Education: Most of Maasai children don't go to school due to the environment they are living. Their parent don't understand the importance of their children to get better education. So we are trying our level best to educate these Maasai societies so that they can allow their children to go to school. Also there are scarcity of nearest school in their areas so we are working hard to build school near them to attract and convince their parent to allow them to attend school.</p>

<p><u><strong>WHY THIS CAMPAIGN IS IMPORTANT</strong></u></p>
<p>We decided to start a school in Maasai society so as to convince the Maasai on Education. Maasai society is leaving a life with no permanent settlement, thus not getting a chance for schooling. Also the society lives a life of animal husbandry which is difficult for parents to allow their children in distant schools due to they depend of them for rearing animals. Therefore starting a school within Maasai society will convince parents allowing their children to attend school near by them. That is the school I started within Maasai society is purposely to help the Maasai children. It is called PAMBAZUKA NAISINYAI PRE &amp; PRIMARY SCHOOL         <a href=""http://www.pambazuka.sc.tz"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.pambazuka.sc.tz</a>   . Already our school has grade one (1) with 65 pupils , grade two with 55 and grade three with 35  pupils and 4 teachers who use most of their time teaching the children for most of them can’t speak neither Swahili nor English, but Maasai language.</p>

<p><u><strong> NEW TWO CLASSES</strong></u></p>
<p>Through our own efforts we have managed to build two classes where grade one and two are using for studying. We have more 10 acres where we want to build more classes as we have more students coming soon. We want to build more classes up to seven classes, we also need to build kitchen, toilet as the one we have is not enough, computers and computer lab, well for keeping water as there is scarcity of water, desks, books, office for teachers, salaries for teachers.</p>

<p>Our future plans are to have secondary school up to university among Maasai society in order to have education nearby so as to fight poverty by getting good education.</p>

<p><u><strong>THE FOLLOWING ARE THE REASONS AS TO WHY MY PROJECT IS VALUABLE TO DONORS AND THE WORLD</strong></u></p>
<p>  This project is very important to donors and world at large for it will connect us with Maasai society for they shall be able to communicate with different people of different nations of the world. Also this will give chance for donors to come and visit Maasai society and learn the real life and culture of Maasai. Apart from that it also helps to eradicate the number of illiterates in the world.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</strong></u></p>
<p>1. Due to studying environment being of low standard life, it is difficult to get skilled teachers and faithful constructors.</p>
<p>2. Another challenge is teacher's salaries, where by in order to get good trainers you also have to pay them well.</p>
<p>3. Another challenge is that , the pupils are fluently speaking Maasai native language, while their teachers don’t know the language and thus difficult to teach them</p>
<p>4. Due to that parents couldn’t get education, and then they find no importance to take their children to school.</p>

Joshua is a Maasai by tribe and he was born and raised in the Maasai communities so he knows much about the challenges facing his communities.He says ""Education has been severe challenge in the Maasai communities as most of families don't know the importance of education for future life of their children. So we are working hard to educate parents and community in general so that they can know the importance of education. So the Pambazuka Naisinyai School is for Maasai children and nearby communities. Please join us and donate something to support this project!!
Our School Started under the tree
Our school started under the tree as we do not have resources to help us for building classes for the Maasai children. Education should start with their parents to educate them so that they can know the importance of education to their children. Some of the parents are now aware about education to their children so they are allowing them to attend school. We are still talking to the parents so that they can give us a good cooperation.

Early Marriage and circumcision for the young Maasai girls.
Imagine a world where every child is educated and can contribute to the development process!!
So many times parents in Maasai  areas tend to give away their young girls for marriage in exchange for just a kilogram of sugar, a goat, a cow , some tea leaves and sometimes for salt. These young girls are then subjected to domestic violence, torture, early child birth and many times girls have died while giving birth because their bodies are never ready to experience child birth.
Many times the parents to these girls need to be empowered with information about the benefits of keeping their children in school until they complete their education. Once these girls have acquired the education, they can provide all the above mentioned items to their parents for the rest of their lives. All that parents need to to practice some bit of patience and sacrifice a little in order to enjoy the fruits of their children.
Circumcision for the women is prohibited but Maasai societies they still circumcise their young girls. We are working hard to educate them so that they can stop this.
Its time to reach out to the parents in the Maasai land settings and sensitize them if we want a better future for girls. A future where they can participate in leadership positions. A future where they can make informed choices and start up families the the men of their choice.
The time is now. Lets teach the Parents because they need this knowledge.

Young Boys:  Young boys normally are send to keep cows and goats far away from home and come back evening everyday. Others they like to go to school but not allowed to go!!

Education: Most of Maasai children don't go to school due to the environment they are living. Their parent don't understand the importance of their children to get better education. So we are trying our level best to educate these Maasai societies so that they can allow their children to go to school. Also there are scarcity of nearest school in their areas so we are working hard to build school near them to attract and convince their parent to allow them to attend school.
Our effort made us to start building Pambazuka Naisinyai School http://www.pambazuka.sc.tz  for which this school started under the tree but with our own effort we have managed to build some two classes and bought some desks so we need to work hard to make it happen!!


 

WHY THIS CAMPAIGN IS IMPORTANT
We decided to start a school in Maasai society so as to convince the Maasai on Education. Maasai society is leaving a life with no permanent settlement, thus not getting a chance for schooling. Also the society lives a life of animal husbandry which is difficult for parents to allow their children in distant schools due to they depend of them for rearing animals. Therefore starting a school within Maasai society will convince parents allowing their children to attend school near by them. That is the school I started within Maasai society is purposely to help the Maasai children. It is called PAMBAZUKA NAISINYAI PRE & PRIMARY SCHOOL         http://www.pambazuka.sc.tz   . Already our school has grade one (1) with 65 pupils , grade two with 55 and grade three with 35  pupils and 4 teachers who use most of their time teaching the children for most of them can’t speak neither Swahili nor English, but Maasai language.

 NEW TWO CLASSES
Through our own efforts we have managed to build two classes where grade one and two are using for studying. We have more 10 acres where we want to build more classes as we have more students coming soon. We want to build more classes up to seven classes, we also need to build kitchen, toilet as the one we have is not enough, computers and computer lab, well for keeping water as there is scarcity of water, desks, books, office for teachers, salaries for teachers.

Our two New Classes
Our future plans are to have secondary school up to university among Maasai society in order to have education nearby so as to fight poverty by getting good education.
  The importance of this campaign is to construct a school within Maasai society, also helping Maasai society withdraw from ignorance and illiteracy so a t cope with the changes of the world.

Under Construction please help a bit
What We Need 
We need to do the following so that we can get our school off the ground; Seven more classes, computer room, Library, computers, Office for the staff, Kitchen, Good toilet, Reading books, tank for water storage and bin maize and beans storage, lunch for the teachers and students, salaries for teachers, Scholarship and to build fence around the school. The estimation costs is $150,000.  ""Every bit will help""
 
Desks: We have managed to buy some desks for one class so class one will not sit on the ground again. Please support us so that we can buy more desks and build more classes!!

Classroom
THE FOLLOWING ARE THE REASONS AS TO WHY MY PROJECT IS VALUABLE TO DONORS AND THE WORLD
  This project is very important to donors and world at large for it will connect us with Maasai society for they shall be able to communicate with different people of different nations of the world. Also this will give chance for donors to come and visit Maasai society and learn the real life and culture of Maasai. Apart from that it also helps to eradicate the number of illiterates in the world.
 
RISKS AND CHALLENGES
1. Due to studying environment being of low standard life, it is difficult to get skilled teachers and faithful constructors.
2. Another challenge is teacher's salaries, where by in order to get good trainers you also have to pay them well.
3. Another challenge is that , the pupils are fluently speaking Maasai native language, while their teachers don’t know the language and thus difficult to teach them
4. Due to that parents couldn’t get education, and then they find no importance to take their children to school.

Men at work bringing  clean water at Pambazuka School, Please help
 
 HOW TO OVERCOME THE CHALLENGES
1. Improving the teaching environment so as to encourage trained teachers to come and teach in our school. Also getting enough trusted constructors for constructing the building.
2. Increasing teacher's salaries so as to motivate the coming of more teachers.
3. Educating parents’ house by house on the importance of taking their children to school.

I spent two months in Nepal in 2014, volunteering for a nonprofit social services organization called Kopila-Nepal. Kopila-Nepal works to better the lives of women, children, and disabled persons and to foster the psychosocial well-being of communities in the Gandaki Zone in western Nepal and recently started a center for the management of child trauma in Kathmandu. Right now, Kopila staff are busy throughout the region affected by the earthquake, providing everything from basic survival supplies to trauma counseling. I am organizing this fundraising campaign on behalf of Kopila's efforts to provide relief and counseling in the Kathmandu area and in and around the earthquake's epicenter in Lamjung, which is located inside Kopila's work area in the Gandaki Zone. Given the exchange rate between the Nepalese rupee and the American dollar and the poverty in which many Nepalis live, a very small contribution from the US can go a long way in Nepal. Even a contribution as small as $5 could make a difference.</p> <div> </div> <div> <h3>Kopila Nepal</h3> <p>What makes Kopila unique is its focus on mental health, which is a relatively new concept in Nepal. Nepali culture still stigmatizes the mentally ill, who are seen as weak and unfit for society and sometimes even as possessed by demons and spirits. Kopila has a staff of young, dedicated psychologists and counselors who go out into the community and work with the destitute, the abused, and the traumatized. Due to Kopila's efforts, clients in remote rural regions have received medical psychiatric care, including anti-depressant medication that enables them to enjoy their families and join in the social life of their villages. This emphasis on mental health come from the recognition that attending to quality of life can sometimes be just as important as ensuring survival and meeting basic needs. </p>
<p>Kopila has deployed  a team of psychologists to Kathmandu  to provide psychological first-aid to earthquake survivors, many of whom have lost their homes and loved ones. In addition, Kopila staff are bringing much-needed supplies into the remote rural villages in the mountains around the quake epicenter where some communities have been waiting for days without relief. Tents, food, and other supplies are being distributed to survivors throughout the Gorkha, Lamjung, and Kaski Districts. Staff are providing support and counseling to injured victims in the hospital in Pokhara. Kopila has strong, experienced leadership and a staff of young, dedicated counselors and psychologists. Each staff member has sacrificed two days of his or her meager salary to help fund these relief activities.</p>
<p>During my time in Nepal, I lived and worked in Pokhara, and also spent time in Kathmandu, Chitwan, Bandipur, and Syangja District.  The photos of some of the structures that symbolize this country's unique and beautiful culture and history brought tears to my eyes. But more than that, I was extremely worried for the welfare of the friends I made and of the warm, friendly, and resilient people I met during my stay.</p>
<p>Nepal is very poor; the United Nations classifies Nepal as a least-developed nation, and it currently ranks 145th out of 187 nations on the Human Development Index.  Nepal is still suffering the effects of a decade-long civil war that ended in 2006. Government instability and political infighting has made it difficult for the country to advance economically and socially, but Nepal has been making progress and has specified a target date of 2022 for emerging from least-developed nation status. The devastation of this earthquake will compound the hardships faced by the Nepali people, both long-term and on a day-to-day basis, and could potentially set back Nepal's economic progress by years.</p>
<p>Nepal will need a lot of help to move forward through this catastrophe. Kopila has a strong commitment to the communities it serves and a long track record of success in helping the needy and fostering psychosocial well-being in villages throughout western Nepal. They have well established working areas in the regions closest to the earthquake's epicenter, and they are in the earthquake response effort for the long haul. If you are considering donating money to relief efforts in Nepal, there are many large, western-based organizations to choose from.  But you may also choose to donate to a smaller organization based in Nepal that already has deepr roots in the affected communities and will remain on the ground in the weeks,  months, and years to come.</p>
<p>As a past volunteer, I have no reservations about urging to you to donate to Kopila. All funds donated here will go directly to Kopila. These are good  people, and they will do good things with your donations.</p>

<p>The Open Floor Society is thrilled to launch a summer youth program at partner organization, Heart of Los Angeles (H.O.L.A.) on June 22nd!</p>
<p>In this 6-day workshop, students will experience and participate in the art of improvisation through live music and dance, lead by a culturally diverse collection of professional artists.  TOFS has been gearing up for this program by holding monthly ""Introduction to Improvisation"" workshops and exhibitions at H.O.L.A. since late 2014. Witnessing the enthusiastic engagement of both students and artists, we are excited to offer an extended program this summer. <br/></p>
<p>Professional dancers, Carolina Cerisola and Sascha Escandon, co-founded The Open Floor Society, 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, as an outgrowth of their initial company, Floor Productions - a passion-driven enterprise that fosters creative expression in movement and live music, established in 2008.  Their experience, along with an incredible network of exceptional artists, instills in them the responsibility to help preserve the value of culture in our society by directly passing down live arts to future generations.  <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Open Floor Society stands on the belief that artistic expression can change lives and empower young people, thereby benefit our society as a whole. </span></p>
<p>The Open Floor Society means to amplify the already documented benefits of music and dance education by adding the powerful element of improvisation. We are dedicated to making improvisation-based music and dance education accessible to all young people, and in particular to serve those for whom the opportunity to participate in such activities is not a part of their educational or community life. Further, our vision is to connect young people with working artists, who as teachers and mentors can pass their craft to the next generation through dynamic and sequential free programs. </p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need </h3> <ul> <li>The fundraising goal for our Summer Youth Program 2015 is $5000. </li>
<li>Thus far, all of our instructors have volunteered their time to give back to the community and pass down their craft. Majority of funds raised through Indiegogo will go directly to our incredible instructors who will commit to a 6 day program, 3-4 hours a day. </li>
<li>Funds will also be used for any extra materials needed for the program, such as additional instrument rentals or purchasing noise makers or prop materials, etc. to allow for more extensive participation. </li>
<li>A small portion of the funds will be used to document our program, creating material for future sponsorship and promotional opportunities. </li>

Professional dancers, Carolina Cerisola and Sascha Escandon, co-founded The Open Floor Society, 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, as an outgrowth of their initial company, Floor Productions - a passion-driven enterprise that fosters creative expression in movement and live music, established in 2008.  Their experience, along with an incredible network of exceptional artists, instills in them the responsibility to help preserve the value of culture in our society by directly passing down live arts to future generations.  The Open Floor Society stands on the belief that artistic expression can change lives and empower young people, thereby benefit our society as a whole. 
The Open Floor Society means to amplify the already documented benefits of music and dance education by adding the powerful element of improvisation. We are dedicated to making improvisation-based music and dance education accessible to all young people, and in particular to serve those for whom the opportunity to participate in such activities is not a part of their educational or community life. Further, our vision is to connect young people with working artists, who as teachers and mentors can pass their craft to the next generation through dynamic and sequential free programs.    What We Need   The fundraising goal for our Summer Youth Program 2015 is $5000. 
Thus far, all of our instructors have volunteered their time to give back to the community and pass down their craft. Majority of funds raised through Indiegogo will go directly to our incredible instructors who will commit to a 6 day program, 3-4 hours a day. 
Funds will also be used for any extra materials needed for the program, such as additional instrument rentals or purchasing noise makers or prop materials, etc. to allow for more extensive participation. 
A small portion of the funds will be used to document our program, creating material for future sponsorship and promotional opportunities. 
Funds raised beyond our goal go right back to the cause, helping in the creation and enhancement of future programs.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h4>What Amal (Hope) will do for the world</h4>
<p>For over a decade, we have all seen and heard about the horrifying war crimes that radical groups and individuals around the world are committing each and every day.  In response to this enormous threat to civilization, the international community has led military forces to begin the fight to defeat the radical groups. However, the unfortunate truth is that in order to eradicate the terrible ideology behind these groups, action must be taken to identify the origin of this horror and correct it. Amal (Hope) is a non-profit organization which aims to do just this; we are working to end extremism by tackling the roots of the issue and establishing a long-term solution so that this problem does not continue into the future.</p>
<h4><br/></h4>
<h4>Our Vision </h4>
<p>Our mission will be accomplished when we have an educated public and an engaged community, where vulnerable teens and adults feel protected and valued, when we win the battle of the heart and mind. Our vision will come when young men see extremism for the destructive lie that it really is, and when these young people make decisions to strengthen families and communities instead of defending violent ideologies. Moderate Muslims, like me, need to be on the front-lines of this battle, challenging violent and self-defeating belief structures, and helping to expose the horrible consequences of extremism. Extremism thrives when we obsess over insignificant differences (skin color, religion, etc). Our goal, then, is to help these bright young people to appreciate our similarities, soften hearts that have been hardened by an ideology that isolate them from the civilized society, and encourage them to 'Live and let live'</p>
<p>My wish for this campaign is to impress the world by what we can achieve together. This campaign will establish real change in the world, and provide an appealing alternative to extremism. The success of this campaign will be an affront to radical groups as we stand with the victims of terror, helping them overcome the reach of extremism and helping them thrive in a caring, effective, and civilized community. In order for vision, this campaign must stretch into even the most unstable and isolated populations. This will not be easy. We cannot do this on our own. We need the support of those who stand up for peace. We need the help of those who believe in civilized social values, and who have a heart to protect future generations from the violence and fear that extremists rely on.  </p>
<p><b>Your contribution</b> will be the driving force that transforms Amal (Hope) from an idea to an active organization where you can be part of the change. This is our chance to unite our hopes and efforts with those of the international community in order to end the terrible ideology that feeds radical groups around the world.  Most importantly though, you will help us support the people whose lives can be affected by radical groups’ actions and make a strong statement to the international community,  and take real actions to solve this problem.  We believe that Amal (Hope) will benefit the public enormously and will contribute to tackling the social factors at the root of extremism.</p>

The role of the guide is to hold secure, ceremonial and practical space for the quester to find a deeper, more resilient self, an intimate connection with nature, and to experience a rite of passage.

I invite you to become a part of my journey – With gratitude and in support of this opportunity, I am asking for community backing with my subsistence during this time, the food and water I will need.
I have been on nomadic walkabout for the past 4 years, living into the practice of Council as a carrier, facilitator and trainer, answering the call to support a global community by training hundreds of people, sitting with youngers and elders, stepping into forums of indigenous wisdom. In order to do this work, I have lived principally from savings as I have not yet found a way for the Council work to sustain me financially.
A clear presence came to me earlier in the year despite this lack of funds, to step up and deepen my connection to vision fast as part of my practice of living Council, a circle of life that will help me to carry forward the teachings held in essence with nature.
If you feel inspired by this journey, please send me anything that would give you pleasure, and in turn I welcome your gifts and will carry them forward through this work and way of life.



The details:
The training takes place next month in the Owens Valley, between the Sierra and Inyo mountains in California. The photos I have used here were taken 2 years ago between these two ranges on the personal 12-day quest that affirmed the work I do with Council, and why I do it. That weird thing is a petroglyph that some say predates those who lived here over 9,000 yrs ago...
The cost of my flight, food, equipment, month-long and gifting the trainers, comes to around £3,300, (an amount I normally live on for 6 months!) I have already used funds from my savings to pay for the flight and two-thirds the training. I have also qualified for a scholarship worth the final third. I am now asking for community support to complete the final part of the cost – namely food, water, equipment and a car share for a month. If I raise more than I ask, I will donate back to the School of Lost Borders so others may benefit from the scholarship. 

In exchange!
I am offering some of my creative and related work as perks, a cunning plan to another way spread and support the work of Council, share some of my other skills and give something back to those who are supporting me in this way. 
£15 GBP – Council In-Flight Card
Yes! Just what you needed, a quick reminder of the basics in council practice done in a fun way, like the airline card in the seat in front of you. A 2-sided A4 sheet with Council in flight ceremony instructions.
£25 GBP – A novel about Council
Even better, I am also happy to offer the novel I finished writing this year, about a successful rock guitarist's journey through disintegrating breakdown to the path of Council, near death experience, temple initiate to a message from the ancient council of Gaia.
Over the threshold of £50 GBP –
whatever you offer will be returned as a reduction in any quest you wish to undertake with me in the future.


Other ways you can help
If you cannot support me financially at this time, there are many ways to help me reach people, support future projects, and collaborate with me in ways where money is not the principle form of exchange. These might include:
• Offer to help me organise a training or an experience to support you and your people by calling council
• Support me in finding a place to stay, a more up-to-date Mac, ipad/modern mobile phone, land on which to create a centre for council...

• Paying it forward - donating directly to family, friends and associates who would benefit from a training or experience, that they may return to your/their community, project or relation, share and spread the practice there.

In sum, please ask your friends to support this campaign, get the word out, and consider the day you will call that council, take that quest...

<p>There is a challenge of
quality education in Nigeria and though the number of schools which provide
quality education is on the increase, the majority cannot afford them. For children to have quality education in
Nigeria, it is a major responsibility of parents and relatives to pay for it
and the price of quality education is very high for those that are poor.  Due to this, a percentage of students in their
6<sup>th</sup> year of education cannot read, speak eloquently, reason
logically, neither do they believe in their potentials and ability to be
creative and innovative or be successful in life.</p>
<p>Nigeria needs
innovative youths with a mindset towards solving problems and nation building
and to be able to raise up such youths, their minds as children, need to be
molded in that direction. Powerful Young Project (PYP) is a platform that facilitates discovery, growth,
self-realization, creativity and innovation in Nigerian Children.</p>
<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441496391/p1nftw2shbvvlnlh8oqa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>At PYP it’s all about the children. If they can’t read, we are there to
teach them, if they lack confidence, we are there to inspire them, if they’ve
got talent; we are there to nurture it. Every child deserves to be told they
can be something in life regardless of where they are coming from. PYP is here
to tell it and also help them be.</p>

<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FH8kkHZPEQ7Q%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DH8kkHZPEQ7Q%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FH8kkHZPEQ7Q%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div><p></p><p>The PYP project involves providing classroom based lessons
together with life studies such as time management, ethics, patriotism,
creativity, peer pressure and bullying, etc. to children in public primary
schools, grade 5 and 6, preparing them for their Common Entrance exams,
secondary school life and life in general.</p>
<p>It began on the 31<sup>st</sup> of Jan 2015. Discovering that a
majority of the students in the 6<sup>th</sup> grade in the public primary
school are performing poorly, we organized a lesson wherein a group of
volunteers, took out 6 hours in a week to teach 175 children, how to read and
write, basic mathematical concepts and tutorials for the common entrance examination
they needed to pass to enter the junior secondary school.</p>
<p><b></b></p><p><b>Our mission</b> is to explore and harness the inbuilt potentials of students by creating opportunities and platforms for effective applications and utilization of latent and manifest attributes.  At the same time build up an ethical and patriotic mind set through the '360-Education' concept where classroom lessons are combined with boosting the innovative, inventive and creative abilities of students;  teaching them how to live, act and become powerful members of their society despite their backgrounds.</p><br/><p><b>Why We Need Your Help</b></p>
<p>PYP has come a long way in building the hopes of these children that they
could be better than they are and that their background does not determine who
they are and what they can achieve. We have achieved so much through donations
from an incredible network of friends and family. But now we are facing our
biggest challenge which goes beyond our financial capabilities and we urgently
need your help.</p>
<p>Out of the one hundred and seventy five children whom we started the
program with, we have twenty- six whom have shown consistency. Although we
would love to provide for this total number, <b>we have selected seven children
who have shown, a love for learning, discipline, hard-work, productivity and an
aspiration of becoming problem solvers in their society. </b></p><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">These children are from poor families and having completed their primary
education, have little hope of attending secondary school.  Some of them might take to street hawking and
other menial jobs to put themselves through school while the desperate ones
among them could resort to stealing and other delinquencies as a means to an
end.</span></p>
<p>If this is allowed to happen, all that we have accomplished so far will
go to waste and be just a memory to them. But we want to succeed and grant
these children a better future.</p>
<p><b>What your donations will be
used for</b></p>
<p>Your donation will go a long way in sending 7 children through their
secondary school education. We have calculated that we need a minimum amount of 18,816 dollars which will cater for their tuition fee, uniforms, notebooks,
textbooks, writing materials, school bags and examination registration fees for
their first year. But we hope to raise more than the total amount needed to cater
for the six years of secondary education which is 112,266 dollars</p>
<p>No matter how much we raise, we are going to send at least a child to
secondary school. If we raise more than we are requesting, we plan to send more
children to school. No amount is too small. Your support will definitely go a long
way.</p>

There is a challenge of
quality education in Nigeria and though the number of schools which provide
quality education is on the increase, the majority cannot afford them. For children to have quality education in
Nigeria, it is a major responsibility of parents and relatives to pay for it
and the price of quality education is very high for those that are poor.  Due to this, a percentage of students in their
6th year of education cannot read, speak eloquently, reason
logically, neither do they believe in their potentials and ability to be
creative and innovative or be successful in life.
Nigeria needs
innovative youths with a mindset towards solving problems and nation building
and to be able to raise up such youths, their minds as children, need to be
molded in that direction. Powerful Young Project (PYP) is a platform that facilitates discovery, growth,
self-realization, creativity and innovation in Nigerian Children.

At PYP it’s all about the children. If they can’t read, we are there to
teach them, if they lack confidence, we are there to inspire them, if they’ve
got talent; we are there to nurture it. Every child deserves to be told they
can be something in life regardless of where they are coming from. PYP is here
to tell it and also help them be.
Who We Are
The PYP project involves providing classroom based lessons
together with life studies such as time management, ethics, patriotism,
creativity, peer pressure and bullying, etc. to children in public primary
schools, grade 5 and 6, preparing them for their Common Entrance exams,
secondary school life and life in general.
It began on the 31st of Jan 2015. Discovering that a
majority of the students in the 6th grade in the public primary
school are performing poorly, we organized a lesson wherein a group of
volunteers, took out 6 hours in a week to teach 175 children, how to read and
write, basic mathematical concepts and tutorials for the common entrance examination
they needed to pass to enter the junior secondary school.
Our mission is to explore and harness the inbuilt potentials of students by creating opportunities and platforms for effective applications and utilization of latent and manifest attributes.  At the same time build up an ethical and patriotic mind set through the '360-Education' concept where classroom lessons are combined with boosting the innovative, inventive and creative abilities of students;  teaching them how to live, act and become powerful members of their society despite their backgrounds.Why We Need Your Help
PYP has come a long way in building the hopes of these children that they
could be better than they are and that their background does not determine who
they are and what they can achieve. We have achieved so much through donations
from an incredible network of friends and family. But now we are facing our
biggest challenge which goes beyond our financial capabilities and we urgently
need your help.
Out of the one hundred and seventy five children whom we started the
program with, we have twenty- six whom have shown consistency. Although we
would love to provide for this total number, we have selected seven children
who have shown, a love for learning, discipline, hard-work, productivity and an
aspiration of becoming problem solvers in their society. These children are from poor families and having completed their primary
education, have little hope of attending secondary school.  Some of them might take to street hawking and
other menial jobs to put themselves through school while the desperate ones
among them could resort to stealing and other delinquencies as a means to an
end.
If this is allowed to happen, all that we have accomplished so far will
go to waste and be just a memory to them. But we want to succeed and grant
these children a better future.
What your donations will be
used for
Your donation will go a long way in sending 7 children through their
secondary school education. We have calculated that we need a minimum amount of 18,816 dollars which will cater for their tuition fee, uniforms, notebooks,
textbooks, writing materials, school bags and examination registration fees for
their first year. But we hope to raise more than the total amount needed to cater
for the six years of secondary education which is 112,266 dollars
No matter how much we raise, we are going to send at least a child to
secondary school. If we raise more than we are requesting, we plan to send more
children to school. No amount is too small. Your support will definitely go a long
way.
The Cost
Total Cost for 7 children is $112,266How do We Plan to Keep the
Money
To ensure transparency and accountability, the money will be placed in a
trust fund. The details of the trust fund once it is set up will be communicated
to all that donated to the cause.
How to DonateOn the top right side of this page, there is a contribute button which you can use to donate any amount using either your debit card or credit card.

If you still have questions concerning how to donate, contact us at hello@powerfulyoungproject.orgOur PerksAll of our perks help us to stay accountable to you as transparency and

event and financials involved in organizing a Children’s Day program for our
students to all the sponsors that participated and it is a culture we are
sticking to. Here is the video Please do view our perks on the right and choose any to donate.Other Ways You Can Help

 We are Khushi-Ureshi Society. Khushi is a Nepalese word and Ureshi is a Japanese word. Both words' meaning is HAPPY. So Khushi-Ureshi Society wants to create happy life to others as soon as possible.  It's a NGO which is registered in Nepal Government.  This school is totally destroyed. When we visited this school, our heart is totally broken after see small children who is studying outside of school. After see   students' situation, we want to spread a beautiful smile for them from your help.  If we could make this school, it will be great achievement for us.  Please, We are very small but your big heart and support will make us bigger. We never let you down. we will report you after rebuild this school.
Without your support not possible to do anything.

Thank you very much for your support.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Inventing a new star globe was not on my Bucket List. My interest was in understanding the hieroglyphics of the ancient Nile region.

<p>The programming language we chose is <b>C++</b>, an object-oriented language. Before CastleRock, students needed five hours to learn the coding logic and an additional two hours to write simple code. But now, the API between the hardware and software provides students an approachable, fun environment to practice coding, without diluting the academic rigor of C++. </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>The object-oriented programming, the real-time communication with RoboCore, and the new principle of robotic programming are all connected, which is the direction of our new curriculum development.</b> We spent months conducting field research among American and Chinese students and came up with a series of new ideas on robotics education. Furthermore, we intend ultimately to improve the quality and functionality of CastleRock by iterative design and data analysis.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Each CastleRock account is its own path into the world of robotics; let each learner explore it individually. Multiple CastleRock accounts allow for you, your children, or your students to attempt all the learning challenges at their own pace.</p>

</div></div>","Meet ROBOTERRAROBOTERRA Origin Kit is a robotics kit for young makers age 10-18 to build their own robots and learn how to code. It contains a collection of robotics building blocks as well as the innovative CastleRock Online Learning Platform. It empowers young makers around the world to build and program their own robot with an up-to-date online robotics curriculum.

Recently Featured In""...They have introduced robotics within education, through the use of colorful robotics learning kits designed for beginners."" by World Economic Forum""With these creations, ROBOTERRA aims to bring college-level learning to middle schoolers."" by Business Insider""The company is increasingly drawing interest from schools in less-privileged districts, something Zhang and her team are particularly excited about."" by CNBC""ROBOTERRA is aiming to be right in the mix with its new robotics kit. Designed with “all ages” in mind, this K’NEX meets coding system is bound to be a hit with both educators and students."" by 9to5Toys



Products 
Origin Kit is comprised of FIVE boxes:

THINK Box

The RoboCore brings your robots to life. It is the BRAIN of your robot.

SENSE Box

Sensors are the SENSORY ORGANS. 

ACT Box

The two 180° Digital Servos make the robot move. 

BUILD Box

The strong and beautiful aluminum parts are the BONES of the robot.

CONNECT Box

All the tools you need to make robots.



CastleRock is an integrated development environment, and also an online robotics curriculum. Bugs and mistakes easily bored students, and we wanted to help them eliminate the trouble.



The programming language we chose is C++, an object-oriented language. Before CastleRock, students needed five hours to learn the coding logic and an additional two hours to write simple code. But now, the API between the hardware and software provides students an approachable, fun environment to practice coding, without diluting the academic rigor of C++. 

The object-oriented programming, the real-time communication with RoboCore, and the new principle of robotic programming are all connected, which is the direction of our new curriculum development. We spent months conducting field research among American and Chinese students and came up with a series of new ideas on robotics education. Furthermore, we intend ultimately to improve the quality and functionality of CastleRock by iterative design and data analysis.

Each CastleRock account is its own path into the world of robotics; let each learner explore it individually. Multiple CastleRock accounts allow for you, your children, or your students to attempt all the learning challenges at their own pace.
Learn more about CastleRock: http://www.roboterra.com/castlerock


Robots that You Can Build
Your robot’s movement will be generated by the input and output it processes. Inside the Origin™ Kit, you’ll find two light sensors, two black-white sensors, two buttons, and two sound sensors all used to input information into RoboCore. The two 180º Servo Motors, and 4 LED light bulbs yield the output RoboCore processes. This combination of input and output creates your robot’s movements.

Developed by the ROBOTERRA engineering team, RoboCore brings your robots to life. RoboCore collects and processes information, as well as makes decisions based on different data inputs. 

2. Hardware, Software and Cloud Synergy
Hardware and software should be used in concert, not in isolation. ROBOTERRA builds on this marriage between hardware and software by offering an experience that involves both simultaneously. When students code in CastleRock (software), they see how their code manifests in their robot (hardware) immediately. This 360º look at robotics shows learners how programming & mechanics are the yin & yang of engineering.

</p><p><b><i>Summary</i></b></p>
<p>Hello, my name is Sam Otero I have had the privilege of
being married to my beautiful wife Madeline for almost 27 years. Unfortunately,
she suffers from a severe case of epilepsy since the age of 5 and experiences
all types of seizures that are not totally controlled by medicine. Throughout
the years she has undergone treatments by medicine, diet, medical implants and
brain surgery with no outstanding effects. </p>
<p>In my graduate studies I explored the idea of trying to find
a way that will reduce the effects of her seizures to help her avoid or
minimize bodily damage. To further explain, directly after the convulsive stage of her seizures, she is in a state of confusion where she often gets hurt while her brain returns to a state of consciousness. During this time of confusion there is a certain amount of auto functionality that a person will exhibit due to daily routines that the brain has learned. I was intrigued by how accurate some of her actions were even though they were automatic. It seemed as if she was possibly reacting to her last state of mind because her facial expressions were consistent with how she was feeling or what she was experiencing before the seizure. I wondered what would happen if a peaceful thought was introduced before the seizure took hold and if it would help reduce the confusion. I asked her to sing a favorite song that calms her to see if it would produce that peaceful canvass that her mind may see during the automatic functioning. I found that certain seizures were reduced by her
singing while in the seizure. We have been able to
reproduce this effect 65% of the time but further research will help us
determine how it can more affective for her and the population of people who
suffer from epilepsy. The understanding is, that a part of the right side of her brain is
activated through singing which interferes with the seizure crossing from the
left side to the right side of the brain. This was confirmed by an epileptologist from the University Hospital in Denver. In effect, she is naturally doing
what stimulators are trying to do. </p>
<p><b><i>What We Need</i></b></p>
<p>Our campaign is to raise funds for testing and recording
equipment, medical tests, surveys, and expenses that are not covered by medical
insurance due to the nature of research. We believe, with your help, we can
provide a possible intervention that may not require intrusive medical
procedures and may help increase the quality of life for those who suffer with
uncontrolled seizures. We also believe this research may theoretically help us towards the development of an early warning system for those who are not able to detect a seizure before it starts. </p>
<p>We are looking to raise 30,000 to purchase the equipment we
need, medical tests, and surveys to confirm our research. It will also help us
with incurred medical expenses and having to modify areas of the house to facilitate
recording. In a sense we are transforming our house into a laboratory to reduce
research costs. If we can’t reach our entire goal, we will use the finances to
start with the preliminary studies and hope to entice other contributors to our
campaign. </p>
<p><b><i>The Impact</i></b></p>
<p>The heart of this campaign is to help those who suffer from
uncontrolled seizures, or epilepsy in general, and have had to limit their lifestyles dramatically to
the point where their quality of life has been minimized. It may also help those who are caretakers that share some of the loss of quality of life. We have seen too many
who have been in danger of hurting themselves and/or others as they
attempt to live their lives. It’s sad to see the look in their eyes as they
feel trapped in their own homes or by the confines of their disability and
together we can make a difference. My wife and I hope that our efforts can be
used to help people around the world. Because we have experienced success in
the minimizing of her seizures, we feel confident that others may have the same
opportunities that we are experiencing. </p>
<p>My wife and I have taken the stand to go through whatever
inconveniences this research may cause for the sake of others. We are not
students looking to learn about this disability alone but participants looking
to help others in need. Thank you to our friends and family who are willing to help where
they can and face the challenges with us. </p><p>
Please
take the time to share this with everyone you meet and ask them to check out our
campaign.

</div>","UN RÉSUMÉ DU PROJET Après
avoir créé en 2007 le Centre
Tao Yoga à Lyon (quartier Croix-Rousse), l’aventure continue avec un projet de plus grande envergure : LA CRÉATION D’UN CENTRE SPIRITUEL ET DE REGENERATION dans l’une des régions les plus
extraordinaires et magiques de cette planète : la Vallée sacrée des Incas, au cœur des Andes Péruviennes, entre Cuzco
(""nombril"" en Quechua) et le Macchu Picchu.Voici la maison ! Climat idéal à 2800 mètres d'altitude, tout près des tropiques mais sans les moustiques :)  Le compromis de vente est signé, reste à la financer d'ici au 8 juillet 2016. POURQUOI CETTE RÉGION EST SI PARTICULIÈRE  Qu'est-ce qui attire des centaines de milliers de personnes du monde entier dans cette région ?Tout simplement parce que cette vallée est unique !  Venez et vous comprendrez pourquoi. La ville de Pisac (capitale Péruvienne de l'artisanat) est l'entrée de la vallée sacrée. Elle représente pour les anciens Incas un condor avec les ailes repliées et ce n'est qu'au bout de la vallée, au Macchu Picchu que ce condor déploie ces ailes pour s'envoler.Cette oiseau mythique est le symbole parfait du chemin initiatique de l'Homme; trouvant en lui les ressources qui l’amènent de l'obscurité à la lumière et de l'enfermement à la liberté.  L'image du condor, c'est aussi prendre de l'altitude pour voir de plus haut cette vie qui nous à été offerte. Parfois, nous nous perdons en chemin, nous perdons le sens de la vie et elle n'a plus de goût. Prendre de la hauteur permet de retrouver son chemin, retrouver le fil de sa vie et enfin de s'y engager. POURQUOI CETTE MAISON ?Depuis des
années, je suis à la recherche d’un lieu en pleine nature où je pourrais organiser des séjours de
régénération et de ressourcement.Quand je suis
arrivé à la porte de cette maison, j’ai su que cela pouvait être là.Une
rivière qui longe le terrain, une allée d’eucalyptus majestueuse, la vue sur le coucher
et le lever du soleil,
le calme absolu tout en étant à proximité d’une petite ville (Calca) avec un marché de fruits et de légumes tous les jours, un aéroport à une heure, le Macchu Picchu à 65 km , le lac Titicaca et la jungle amazonienne à 8 heures de bus, et, sur place des sites incas et pré incas de toutes
beautés et d’une forte puissance énergétique. La maison orientée plein sud est constituée de 5 chambres, d'un salon avec une cheminée, d'une salle à manger, d'une cuisine et d'une grande salle indépendante dans laquelle j'envisage d'y faire un studio.Elle pourra accueillir confortablement une dizaine de personnes.Le terrain d'une surface de 1350 m² accueillera la construction d'une salle de pratique qui sera ouverte à la location pour des stages, des formations, des événements autour de la régénération, du développement personnel  et du bien-être. QUI SUIS-JE ?Pour me
présenter brièvement, j’ai très tôt été attiré par les traditions orientales. J’ai commencé à apprendre le chinois dès l’âge de 11 ans. Plus tard, j’ai eu la
chance de faire une formation de professeur de Kundalini
Yoga, de praticien en Chineitsang (massage Taoïste des organes internes) ainsi
que 3 ans d’études du Karam Kriya (numérologie sacrée). Tout ce qui concerne la guérison holistique de l'être humain me passionne.J’ai ouvert le
centre Tao Yoga à Lyon sur le plateau de la Croix-Rousse en 2007 et j’organise depuis plusieurs années des séjours de
régénération en nature avec ma collaboratrice Sat Prem.Actuellement, je suis entrain de finir d'écrire deux livres que vous pouvez dès maintenant commander sur cette page. L'un sur le parcours qui m'a conduit dans les Andes et l'autre sur le lien peu connu entre l'âme et la digestion.Pour plus information sur le centre et mes activités, vous pouvez faire un tour sur les sites suivants :www.taoyoga-chineitsang.netwww.centretaoyoga.fr  POURQUOI VOTRE SOUTIEN EST PRÉCIEUX MAINTENANT ?                                    A moins de 5 mois de la signature définitive, c'est maintenant que je dois faire la différence.Le coût total du projet est de 214 000 euros comprenant l'achat de la maison, les frais divers d'achat et les travaux nécessaires pour faire de cette maison un nid douillet. 4000 euros ont déjà été versé pour le compromis. A ce jour, je suis propriétaire des murs du centre Tao Yoga mais je n'ai pas d'économie de coté. Je ne souhaite pas vendre le centre de Lyon dans l'esprit de créer une passerelle entre le Pérou et la France.Deux banques ont refusées de me faire un prêt car mes revenus ne sont pas suffisant à leurs yeux  même s'ils pourraient prendre une hypothèque sur mon local.C'est pourquoi, je m'en remet à la communauté humaine, c'est à dire vous :) pour que ce projet aboutisse. COMMENT SOUTENIR MON PROJET ?En en parlant autour de vous.En partageant ce projet dans vos réseaux.En achetant les livres en pré-vente. En participant aux stages. En vous offrant un soin de Chi Nei Tsang. Je suis également ouvert à toutes autres propositions allant dans le sens de ce projet.

Un extrait du livre à paraitre au plus tard en juin 2016"" Choisir la division, c'est comme jeter ses clefs dans l'eau trouble d'un lac, on se met soi-même à la porte de sa maison.En retrouvant l'Unité, l'eau s’éclaircit et l'on retourne chez soi.La seule question qui importe donc est : Comment retrouvé l'Unité ?Cette question en implique une autre : qu'est-ce que l'Unité ?L'Unité est-elle appréhendable par le mental qui est justement par essence la fonction en soi qui coupe, qui juge et qui catégorise ?Comment unir et réunir ?Comment être à la fois de gauche ET de droite ?Blanc ET noir ?Haut et bas ?Feu et eau ?Impossible car c'est un paradoxe, mais le paradoxe est justement le garage de notre mental, là ou l'on gare notre voiture car elle n'a rien à faire dans le salon.Notre salon n'est pas une autoroute. Si tout va bien, c'est le lieu ou l'on se pose, ou l'on se dépose et ou l'on se repose. C'est notre havre de paix.Comment retrouver l'Unité ?En retrouvant la paix en soi.En unissant et en réunissant en soi ce qui à priori est contradictoire.On ne peux résoudre un paradoxe.On ne peux que faire la paix en soi et alors, il n'y a plus de paradoxe. Il se dissout comme le sucre dans le café."" A ma connaissance , c'est le premier ouvrage en Français qui traite d'une ancienne tradition de guérison des Andes, pourtant utilisé depuis des milliers d'années par les chamanes et les guérisseurs. Il est constitué d'un mélange d'explications factuelles et de plusieurs textes écrits dans la nature ou dans des lieux de hautes énergies, sur des sites Incas et pré-Incas.
                                 Je partage dans ce livre plus de 15 années de pratique, de recherche et d'expérience autour de la digestion. J'aborde entre autre les thèmes suivant :Digestion et habitat : Comprenez votre digestion en observant votre habitat.L'alimentation pour augmenter votre énergie (et pas le contraire !)Respiration Yogique pour stimuler les organes internes et la détoxication.Écrire pour renforcer votre capacité à digérer.La
 place du ventre dans le corps. Le ventre n'est pas une finalité mais un
 lieu de passage.Comprendre la vie humaine et les étapes nécessaires à traverser. Qu'est-ce
 que l’âme à l’intérieur de nous ?  Comment reconnaitre ses besoins ? 
Quels liens entretient-elle avec la digestion et pourquoi on ne peut 
la laisser sans voix et sans voie. Ce livre se veut 
pratique et accessible. De nombreux exercices vous sont proposés pour 
avoir les moyens de prendre votre vie en main. Digérer oui, mais pour 
évoluer dans le sens de nos aspirations profondes.Extrait d'une méditation  Méditation sur le point précis du centre du fond du
nombril
"" Amenez votre attention et ce puissant sourire
au niveau de votre nombril. Sentez que l’énergie de la Terre remonte en vous par
vos jambes et vous donne tout le soutien nécessaire pour continuer votre
méditation. Sentez le soutien du règne minéral avec les pierres précieuses et les belles
montagnes que vous aimez. Sentez le soutien du règne végétal avec les grandes forêts,
les fleurs et les plantes qui guérissent. Sentez le soutien du règne animal avec vos animaux préférés,
ceux qui vous donnent de l’énergie et de la force. Et enfin, sentez l’énergie
de la terre elle-même;  puissante,
lumineuse et souriante.Sentez l’amour de la Terre-Mère remonter en vous. Sentez cette vibration et cette énergie de la vie.
Soyez curieux (se) maintenant du centre
du fond du nombril, cet espace particulier et unique de votre corps.
Détendez-vous et amenez une attention soutenue mais douce dans ce point précis
du centre du fond du nombril.
Y-a-t-il des ressentis dans ce
point ? Une chaleur ? Une vibration ? Une lumière ? Un
passage ? Rien du tout ? Soyez curieux(se).
Votre mental va sûrement se
déconcentrer, être dispersé mais gardez le cap aussi longtemps que cela reste
confortable pour vous. ""

This is why ADEF fundraises for the camps from organizations, companies, communities and individuals.</p><p>The residential fun-based summer camps gathers <strong>66 participants and we try to strike a 50% female participation</strong> in every camp. It acts as an experiential venue and ideal environment for learning and self-expression. With a carefully crafted program born out of months of curricula development and a highly trained and engaged team, the results are astounding.</p><p>ADEC crafts a structure where participants freely explore and experiment with the rich programming in both digital and physical activities that emancipate a sense of mental and physical expression. From <strong>video-making, to sound and music production, to creative applications on the web, creative physical activities, art workshops and field trips</strong>, the two-week camp quickly evolve into a revolution of expression.</p><p>Since 2007 <strong>more than 630 male and female teenagers from 11 Arab countries </strong>have lived and benefited from the experience, offering them a unique opportunity to discover their abilities and express themselves freely through arts and technology​ while building their personality by learning ethical values such as :<strong>Humanity, equality, respect others and accept difference, adaptation and  coexistence, leadership, critical thinking and teamwork.</strong></p><p>Because of the diversity and intensity of the program and participants, the camps are often a life-changing experience, for both youngsters and trainers. Youngsters and trainers share experiences and bond through both the physical and digital spaces of they create.</p><p>Final outputs from the camps are displayed on the web. Other avenues of exhibition are also arranged, through local and regional media and partner organizations.</p><p><strong><u>Watch a selection of  camps workshops videos:</u></strong></p><ul><li>Robot and a turbine and 3D printer</li></ul><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/xN3REg95-_o?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><ul><li>Filming, editing, dancing and diving</li></ul><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/EoAsv-FM7Lo?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><h3>When and Where?</h3><p>ADEC 12th annual camp will take place from July 16 - July 30, 2018 in Lebanon.</p><h3>How to support us?</h3><p>With this campaign we are aiming to collect<strong> $15,000</strong> which would cover the participation of <b>10 underprivileged teenagers and their travel expense</b>.The cost to fund one camper is $1,500 which covers: full board accommodation, education fees, computer lab facilities, video &amp; sound equipment, scheduled trips, sports equipment, cultural activities and transportation.</p><p><strong>Every year ADEC main goal is to provide scholarships for 40 underprivileged Arab teenagers ( 60% of the total number of participants) whose communities remain deprived and lack access to knowledge, information, artistic and cultural services through the collaboration of partner NGOs in the region whose mandate focuses on youth development, ICT, arts, and expression.</strong></p><p>Part of the camps becoming a meaningful experience is community participation in making it unfold and successfully happen, in the belief of the critical value of youth engagement.</p><p>We cannot do this without the ongoing support of people like you who believe in building a foundation within our youth for a brighter future.</p><p>Even if we don't reach our goal with this campaign, every penny raised will go to ensuring our camps are a success and a true product of community engagement.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3><p>The growth of our community, its entanglement with a variety of causes and its expansion into different territories of art making, expression and technology creation are key indicators of the camps' success. The camps sets the stage for this community by providing a unique experience of learning, self-discovery, critical thinking and expression, which are missing aspects in most mainstream education across the region.</p><p><strong><u>Here are few examples of the short term impact we have seen throughout the previous camps rounds:</u></strong></p><ul>
<li>
<strong>ADEC 2017:</strong> A Lebanese camper, who was very involved in all sound workshops, learned how to DJ and DJed twice during the camp, including the graduation party. He is still in contact with and being mentored by our sound trainer to evolve his skills in music.</li>
<li>
<strong>ADEC 2016:</strong> We discovered two female techies (from Port-Said and Damanhur Governorates which are usually extremely marginalized compared to urban cities in Egypt) whose graduation project was a ""Raspberry pie"" that unlocks the Wi-Fi passwords!</li>
<li>
<strong>ADEC 2013 - 2015:</strong> Four girls have been awarded UWC scholarship, which is one of 16 campuses located on five continents that serves students age 16-19 who represent more than 70 different countries, to do their masters in the different fields of arts ( music, theatre, visual arts...etc) through their unique academic approach and program that combines academic challenge with an experiential, hands-on approach to learning.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Success Stories:</strong></p><ol>
<li>One of the major and most important indicator of success is that after more than 10 years of ADEF youth empowerment experience, ADEC camps (since 2016) are now led and managed by its first and second generation campers; meaning ADEC ex-campers who participated in the camps between 2007 and 2011, and who grew and developed and are now capable of handling the running of the camp. Since then, ADEC camps are fully running by its ex-campers to date.</li>
<li>
<strong>Amina Allam,</strong> a success story of a young female teenager who joined ADEC in 2008 as a camper and over the time her skills have developed qualifying her to work different roles in the following camps rounds as group leader then a camp administrator, then group leader supervisor and trainer. Additionally, Amina worked as an assistant producer from 2014 - 2016 in a film production company in Cairo and she is currently completing her degree in digital film production at SAE institute in London.</li>
<li>
<strong>Shady Said</strong>, is another success story of a teenager camper in ADEC 2008 who is now a trainer in the sound and music workshop since ADEC 2016 to date . <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIhfFbMJ-ws"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">(<strong>Watch Video</strong>)</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Yazan Arori</strong> is the youngest trainer in ADEC! Yazan is 18 years old from Palestine. He joined ADEC for two consecutive years in 2014 and 2015 where he showed impressive development in the workshops of technology and programming through the two year that allowed him to participate in ADEC 2016 as a co-trainer in the ""Makers"" workshop. He is now is Berlin pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering.</li>

الاقتصادية والاجتماعية </strong>حيث أن الإشتراك في المخيمات ليس مشروطًا بالإمكانيات المادية. فقد يمكن للمشاركين المقتدرين دفع رسوم الاشتراك بالكامل والمساهمة أيضًا في تمويل غيرهم من غير المقتدرين ، في حين أن أولئك الذين لا يستطيعون دفع الرسوم بالكامل، يتم تمويلهم جزئيًا أو كليًا. ولهذا تسعى أضِف باستمرار لجمع التبرعات للمخيمات من المنظمات والشركات والمجتمعات والأفراد.</p><p style=""direction:

وتقنية<strong> (صناعة الفيديو، إنتاج الصوت، التصميم البصري، تطبيقات الوِب الإبداعية، تصميم الألعاب، البرمجة)</strong> وأخرى بدنية تركز على تحفيز التعبير الذاتي العاطفي، الفكري والجسدي مثل

This is why ADEF fundraises for the camps from organizations, companies, communities and individuals.The residential fun-based summer camps gathers 66 participants and we try to strike a 50% female participation in every camp. It acts as an experiential venue and ideal environment for learning and self-expression. With a carefully crafted program born out of months of curricula development and a highly trained and engaged team, the results are astounding.ADEC crafts a structure where participants freely explore and experiment with the rich programming in both digital and physical activities that emancipate a sense of mental and physical expression. From video-making, to sound and music production, to creative applications on the web, creative physical activities, art workshops and field trips, the two-week camp quickly evolve into a revolution of expression.Since 2007 more than 630 male and female teenagers from 11 Arab countries have lived and benefited from the experience, offering them a unique opportunity to discover their abilities and express themselves freely through arts and technology​ while building their personality by learning ethical values such as :Humanity, equality, respect others and accept difference, adaptation and  coexistence, leadership, critical thinking and teamwork.Because of the diversity and intensity of the program and participants, the camps are often a life-changing experience, for both youngsters and trainers. Youngsters and trainers share experiences and bond through both the physical and digital spaces of they create.Final outputs from the camps are displayed on the web. Other avenues of exhibition are also arranged, through local and regional media and partner organizations.Watch a selection of  camps workshops videos:Robot and a turbine and 3D printerFilming, editing, dancing and diving When and Where?ADEC 12th annual camp will take place from July 16 - July 30, 2018 in Lebanon.How to support us?With this campaign we are aiming to collect $15,000 which would cover the participation of 10 underprivileged teenagers and their travel expense.The cost to fund one camper is $1,500 which covers: full board accommodation, education fees, computer lab facilities, video & sound equipment, scheduled trips, sports equipment, cultural activities and transportation.Every year ADEC main goal is to provide scholarships for 40 underprivileged Arab teenagers ( 60% of the total number of participants) whose communities remain deprived and lack access to knowledge, information, artistic and cultural services through the collaboration of partner NGOs in the region whose mandate focuses on youth development, ICT, arts, and expression.Part of the camps becoming a meaningful experience is community participation in making it unfold and successfully happen, in the belief of the critical value of youth engagement.We cannot do this without the ongoing support of people like you who believe in building a foundation within our youth for a brighter future.Even if we don't reach our goal with this campaign, every penny raised will go to ensuring our camps are a success and a true product of community engagement. The ImpactThe growth of our community, its entanglement with a variety of causes and its expansion into different territories of art making, expression and technology creation are key indicators of the camps' success. The camps sets the stage for this community by providing a unique experience of learning, self-discovery, critical thinking and expression, which are missing aspects in most mainstream education across the region.Here are few examples of the short term impact we have seen throughout the previous camps rounds:

ADEC 2017: A Lebanese camper, who was very involved in all sound workshops, learned how to DJ and DJed twice during the camp, including the graduation party. He is still in contact with and being mentored by our sound trainer to evolve his skills in music.

ADEC 2016: We discovered two female techies (from Port-Said and Damanhur Governorates which are usually extremely marginalized compared to urban cities in Egypt) whose graduation project was a ""Raspberry pie"" that unlocks the Wi-Fi passwords!

ADEC 2013 - 2015: Four girls have been awarded UWC scholarship, which is one of 16 campuses located on five continents that serves students age 16-19 who represent more than 70 different countries, to do their masters in the different fields of arts ( music, theatre, visual arts...etc) through their unique academic approach and program that combines academic challenge with an experiential, hands-on approach to learning.
Success Stories:
One of the major and most important indicator of success is that after more than 10 years of ADEF youth empowerment experience, ADEC camps (since 2016) are now led and managed by its first and second generation campers; meaning ADEC ex-campers who participated in the camps between 2007 and 2011, and who grew and developed and are now capable of handling the running of the camp. Since then, ADEC camps are fully running by its ex-campers to date.

Amina Allam, a success story of a young female teenager who joined ADEC in 2008 as a camper and over the time her skills have developed qualifying her to work different roles in the following camps rounds as group leader then a camp administrator, then group leader supervisor and trainer. Additionally, Amina worked as an assistant producer from 2014 - 2016 in a film production company in Cairo and she is currently completing her degree in digital film production at SAE institute in London.

Shady Said, is another success story of a teenager camper in ADEC 2008 who is now a trainer in the sound and music workshop since ADEC 2016 to date . (Watch Video)


Yazan Arori is the youngest trainer in ADEC! Yazan is 18 years old from Palestine. He joined ADEC for two consecutive years in 2014 and 2015 where he showed impressive development in the workshops of technology and programming through the two year that allowed him to participate in ADEC 2016 as a co-trainer in the ""Makers"" workshop. He is now is Berlin pursuing a degree in Electrical Engineering.

</div></div><h2><strong>WHY <i>EASYSURGERY</i>?</strong></h2><p>Suturing is one of the most essential skills that students and junior doctors have to master in order to advance in their profession. However, there are challenges with existing training tools. First, there are approximately 1M graduates per year worldwide. Yet, only a small number of students can access easy to use training tools or the ability to afford expensive courses. Second, since the human body is composed of different tissues, doctors need a tool to assess the most appropriate suturing technique. Unfortunately, most existing training devices do not offer this capability. The cost of medical education is already very high and there is a lack of affordable surgical training tools!</p><div>

</div><p>All the drawbacks of existing training devices motivated us to design the first ever training platform which is versatile, and accessible to everyone. We designed our device to be portable so everybody can advance their suturing skills with ease – regardless of whether at university, at home or with fellow medical students. See all the details below and support our campaign that we can bring our patented technology to reality!</p><div>

MEW is based on the fundamentals and guidelines of traditional electrospinning with solutions and combines it with 3D printing principles. The “writing” of polymer melts, is a rising additive manufacturing technology for biomedical applications proven on a scientific as well as commercial level. The technique facilitates the direct deposition of biocompatible polymer fibers to fabricate preprogramed well-ordered scaffolds in the micron- to nano-scale range. The generation of an electrical field around a viscous polymeric bubble leads to the ejection of a fibre and accelerates it towards a grounded collecting plate (or rotating mandrel).

WHY EASYSURGERY?Suturing is one of the most essential skills that students and junior doctors have to master in order to advance in their profession. However, there are challenges with existing training tools. First, there are approximately 1M graduates per year worldwide. Yet, only a small number of students can access easy to use training tools or the ability to afford expensive courses. Second, since the human body is composed of different tissues, doctors need a tool to assess the most appropriate suturing technique. Unfortunately, most existing training devices do not offer this capability. The cost of medical education is already very high and there is a lack of affordable surgical training tools!

 
All the drawbacks of existing training devices motivated us to design the first ever training platform which is versatile, and accessible to everyone. We designed our device to be portable so everybody can advance their suturing skills with ease – regardless of whether at university, at home or with fellow medical students. See all the details below and support our campaign that we can bring our patented technology to reality!

 
Our first device - available already!Our patented first product consists of easy-to-use mounts for the quick installation of your tissue analogues. We further equipped our device with an adjustable sample holder to pretension the tissue analogues to simulate different clinical scenarios. With its integrated force gauge, you can now measure the strength of your suture and evaluate your technique. Our innovative second product, available soon!With your support we can introduce a new lean design, which we will deliver by end of Q2 2019. Our V2 is designed to fit in every bag and is equipped with an integrated camera system, which automatically connects to your phone via Bluetooth. A comfortable pillow for smooth operations and a small slide for storage lets you train more comfortably. EASYSURGERY APP - accessible to everyone!Our smartphone app will automatically connect to your training device. You can create your personal profile on our EASYSURGERY APP to record your training and review as well as evaluate your results to check on your progress. In addition, you can benchmark your suture skills with other medical students and doctors around the globe.

 
TISSUE ANALOGUESEASYSURGERY allows users to train on tissue analogues, which all represent different parts of the body. These come pre-installed on easy-to-use mounts for the quick installation on the device. With its integrated force gauge, user can measure the strength of suturing and evaluate their technique. The material uses for the tissue analogues is medical-grade Polycaprolactone, an FDA approved, biocompatible high-tech polymer used and tested in our labs.Our innovative additive manufacturing technology, called Melt Electrowriting (MEW) allows us to manufacture the tissue analogues. MEW is based on the fundamentals and guidelines of traditional electrospinning with solutions and combines it with 3D printing principles. The “writing” of polymer melts, is a rising additive manufacturing technology for biomedical applications proven on a scientific as well as commercial level. The technique facilitates the direct deposition of biocompatible polymer fibers to fabricate preprogramed well-ordered scaffolds in the micron- to nano-scale range. The generation of an electrical field around a viscous polymeric bubble leads to the ejection of a fibre and accelerates it towards a grounded collecting plate (or rotating mandrel). It deposits as a continuous fiber according to its relative movement following the principles of 3D Printing. Hence allowing the targeted fabrication of analogues for arteris, ligaments, tendons, skin or muscle.

 
TEAMThe idea of EASYSURGERY was born in the Institute of Biomedical Innovation at the Queensland University of Technology in Queensland, Australia. The group, headed by distinguished Professor Dietmar Hutmacher is internationally renown for translating core science into real world applications. The ARC Industrial Transformation Training Centre in Additive Biomanufacturing, Hutmachers latest research project brings together an outstanding team of high profile scientists, engineers and industry partners from Australia and around the world to help transform the industry of 3D printing for medical applications.     ENQUIRERSTel: +61 7 3138 6287Mail: easy.surgery@aol.comPostal addressInstitute of Health and Biomedical innovationQueensland University of Technology60 Musk Avenue, Kelvin Grove QLD 4059 Australia WHY we need your supportWith your support, we can get EASYSURGEY off the ground.

According to the Supreme Court's ruling in Miller v. Alabama: Mandatory life without parole for a juvenile precludes consideration of his chronological age and its hallmark features -- among them, immaturity, impetuosity, and failure to appreciate risks and consequences. It prevents taking into account the family and home environment that surrounds him -- and from which he cannot extricate himself -- no matter how brutal or dysfunctional. It neglects circumstances of the homicide offense, including the extent of his participation in the conduct and the way familial and peer pressures may have affected him.

Kerry 'Shakaboona' Marshall was a child when sentenced to DIE in prison. He is now a responsible man of forty-five years old. His case must be presented to the judge by a defense team with experience (not a public defender) who will establish his growth and verify his character.  
From within the restraints of prison: 

Shakaboona has held the positions of: Vice-President of the PA Lifers Association at SCI-Huntingdon, Committee Chairperson of the NAACP Graterford Branch, President of the Para-Professional Law Clinic at SCI-Graterford, and Secretary of the Regents Betterment Organization at SCI-Mahanoy.
He is the founder or co-founder of several groups that are located outside of prison walls, namely: Families United (FU) organization, Families of Prisoners & Communities Union (FCU) organization, and the Human Rights Coalition (HRC) organization.
He is the co-founder and Editor of The Movement magazine, a human rights advocacy publication with subscribers nationwide; it serves as a tool for public awareness and connect prisoners to the outside world.
Shakaboona does popular radio commentary on social/political issues for Prison Radio and submits written commentary articles for the Socialist Viewpoint magazine, San Francisco Bay View newspaper, and Workers World newspaper.

Any amount you can give will be helpful ($25, $100, $1,000) and will go towards Kerry's re-sentencing hearing.

<p><b>The
Refugee Fluency Project:</b></p>
<p>My Name is Paul Gossen, I am the CEO and cofounder of Velocity. </p>
<p>Our mission is to give fluency to one million EU
refugees, so they can become fully integrated, have successful careers and give
back more to their new culture. This promise is founded on the
Velocity system for fast conversational fluency.</p>
<p>We have
the technology to do this. Velocity has
""cracked the code"" on language fluency. Velocity
is a complete system that has been tested and proven with thousands of people
over the past 24 years. We are already scaling this out to large numbers of
people in China. We just finished a 2015
survey of 250 graduates at SAP Labs in Shanghai, which demonstrated a jump from
18 to 89% of graduates who reported feeling comfortable in their new language.</p>
<p><b>What We
Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>Right now our immediate need is to demonstrate the high-impact results of
the Fluency Program to EU officials, the Red Cross and the UNHCR through a
pilot demonstration program.<span>  </span>We already have volunteer communities
in Vienna and Rome that are planning pilots in late November.</p>
<p>What if you could give a
new life to a Refugee family?</p>
<p>We are requesting that you
sponsor one Refugee for $100 USD. <br/></p>
<p>This will allow one person
to go through the 3-day / 3 month program. This will allow them to build basic
conversational fluency in their new language and step onto a path of success in
their new culture. As a thank you, we will give you a copy of the new Velocity Fluency book.<br/></p>
<p><b>The
Impact</b></p>
<p>It is critical that we demonstrate the high-impact nature of our technology.
There is ample funding for the refugees, but there is a severe shortage of
credible solutions. Once we have demonstrated this program, many
more EU resources can be made available.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a highly developed program that has
     already been demonstrated to be effective for many other people around the
     world<br/>
</li>
<li>We need to show that it works with these Refugees
     who are in crisis now<br/>
</li>
<li>Once we have done this we can access funding and intend to scale up 100 times<br/>
</li>
<li>Your $100 pilot sponsorship of one person has
     the potential to help 100 Refugees</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Risks
&amp; Challenges</b></p>
<p>There are risks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our deadline is short: our first pilot begins
     in Rome Nov 17-19</li>
<li>Although we have worked with hundreds of
     immigrants, we have not run this program before with refugees in crisis.
     There are unknowns.</li>
<li>The project may
     not get accepted by the funding agencies</li>
<li>We may not
     achieve a critical mass of interest in this project</li>
<li>If we do not
     achieve our goal of $5000 USD, we will attempt to run our pilots anyway.
     If we cannot run our pilot program, all money will go to the UNHCR Refugee
     Fund.</li>

</div>","The
Refugee Fluency Project:
My Name is Paul Gossen, I am the CEO and cofounder of Velocity. 
Our mission is to give fluency to one million EU
refugees, so they can become fully integrated, have successful careers and give
back more to their new culture. This promise is founded on the
Velocity system for fast conversational fluency.
We have
the technology to do this. Velocity has
""cracked the code"" on language fluency. Velocity
is a complete system that has been tested and proven with thousands of people
over the past 24 years. We are already scaling this out to large numbers of
people in China. We just finished a 2015
survey of 250 graduates at SAP Labs in Shanghai, which demonstrated a jump from
18 to 89% of graduates who reported feeling comfortable in their new language.
What We
Need & What You Get
Right now our immediate need is to demonstrate the high-impact results of
the Fluency Program to EU officials, the Red Cross and the UNHCR through a
pilot demonstration program.  We already have volunteer communities
in Vienna and Rome that are planning pilots in late November.
What if you could give a
new life to a Refugee family?
We are requesting that you
sponsor one Refugee for $100 USD. 
This will allow one person
to go through the 3-day / 3 month program. This will allow them to build basic
conversational fluency in their new language and step onto a path of success in
their new culture. As a thank you, we will give you a copy of the new Velocity Fluency book.
The
Impact
It is critical that we demonstrate the high-impact nature of our technology.
There is ample funding for the refugees, but there is a severe shortage of
credible solutions. Once we have demonstrated this program, many
more EU resources can be made available.

This is a highly developed program that has
     already been demonstrated to be effective for many other people around the
     world

We need to show that it works with these Refugees
     who are in crisis now

Once we have done this we can access funding and intend to scale up 100 times

Your $100 pilot sponsorship of one person has
     the potential to help 100 Refugees

Risks
& Challenges
There are risks:

Our deadline is short: our first pilot begins
     in Rome Nov 17-19
Although we have worked with hundreds of
     immigrants, we have not run this program before with refugees in crisis.
     There are unknowns.
The project may
     not get accepted by the funding agencies
We may not
     achieve a critical mass of interest in this project
If we do not
     achieve our goal of $5000 USD, we will attempt to run our pilots anyway.
     If we cannot run our pilot program, all money will go to the UNHCR Refugee
     Fund.

How the
Velocity Refugee Fluency Program Works:
Velocity uses a powerful mixture of
intensive, ongoing learning, live, online and virtual training. The intensive program is 3 action-packed
days focused learning for groups of 40-60 people. This allows the participant
to pass through an intensity threshold and begin to break the language barrier:

The program
     is focused on basic communication, not pass the test learning. 
Rather than
     starting from the bottom-up with grammar and vocabulary, we start
     from the top down with simple sentence templates and structured
     conversations. 
Using
     simple template conversations, participants can experience the first steps
     to basic conversational fluency in a few days. This creates an immediate
     experience of basic fluency that is the foundation for all future learning
Velocity
     embeds the new language structure into visual sentence templates. 
Visual
     learning allows participants to achieve basic fluency without getting
     stuck in memorization, language structure or grammar rules. 
Light
     conversational fluency allows participants to engage in real spoken
     communication.


The ongoing program is the key to the Velocity systems high rate of
fast language adoption. Users form small groups of 10-25 people that practice
and play in chapter meetings. These sessions are lead by graduates and
participants who take on the roles of the Champion. 

The
     follow-up program takes place as a series of Quests or small learning
     adventures. 
Participants
     build confidence as they begin to approach native speakers and engage in
     real conversations. 
Participants
     form Toastmasters style Chapters in which the graduates train the new
     students and progress through levels of development.  

Velocity
     communities are self-replicating. The Velocity approach naturally spreads
     as participants engage and share. 
Senior
     students become Champions and go on to form more learning communities.
     Champions celebrate success stories in each chapter meeting.

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The construction camp is scheduled between 30 May – 29 June 2016 and is planned as following:</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">1. First of all we need to bring water to the camp from a spring placed at a 100 m distance. The source's altitude is higher with 16 m from the camp's level so the water will fall down naturally through a water supply system directly to the kitchen area, the pond and the trough for cattle. The pond will be placed in the swampy area near the camp and will become a natural ecosystem for fishes and water plants.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">2. Three weeks are dedicated to build an ensemble of 5 cob houses.

<p>6,000 EUR is a small amount to raise but for us is essential to be able to fulfill our construction plan. If we raise more than we expect we’ll use the money to create a garden based on permaculture principles with vegetables, aromatic plants and mushrooms.

The Cultural Association Groove ON was founded in 2012 by a young community interested in nature, history and ethnography. Its mission is to research, preserve and promote the authentic Romanian traditions.

Traditional shelter from Tecsesti
We started in August 2014 the construction of a living museum in an old isolated village called Tecșești, in the Transylvanian Western Carpathians Apuseni Mountains. The village is near the Natural Reserve Piatra Cetii, at an altitude of 1,000 m. Thanks to its position the place is special for having a meadow with daffodils with an unique botanical, geological and paleonthological complexity and landscapes of an untold beauty.

Tecsesti, Alba County, Romania
The village is almost depopulated. About 14 elders still live here today given that in the 50’s almost 350 people lived in a self sufficient community specific to the mountain villages inhabited by shepherds.
Our mission is to transform the village into a living museum in order to preserve its authenticity, traditional architecture, customs and local crafts. To achieve this goal we'll dedicate the next years to research, to learn and to experiment how our ancestors lived in this environment, from the Neolithic to the present.

At the end of the construction camp we'll organize a traditional festival called Nedeia (30 June – 3 July 2016) to celebrate the fulfillment of a beautiful dream. The event is a modern adaptation of the traditional local festive gatherings with music, fair, craft workshops and local food. We gladly invite everyone interested in folklore and world music to join us at Nedeia.

Nedeia, 3-5 July 2015, Tecsesti, Alba County
The money raised in this crowdfunding campaign is used for:

Tools and construction equipment: hand saws, rip saws, axes, pickaxes, machetes, spades, hoes, wheelbarrows, rope, 100 m pipe and protection equipment for the workers.
Food: daily meals for workers (30 volunteers)
Fuel (approx. 500 l of gasoline)

6,000 EUR is a small amount to raise but for us is essential to be able to fulfill our construction plan. If we raise more than we expect we’ll use the money to create a garden based on permaculture principles with vegetables, aromatic plants and mushrooms. If  we can't raise the whole amount we calculated that it will take us 3 years to build the Neolithic sector using our personal contribution and renting tools and equipment.

Perks
For those who pledge starting with 15 EUR up to 99 EUR the perks offered are:

Special thanks for being part of this project on our site and in the Living Museum Book.
The digital version of the La Origini Audio Folklore Collection Season I Apuseni Mountains. Last winter we started an ethnographic research project. Between December 2014 - February 2015 we recorded carols, flute songs, folk songs “doine”, war songs, prayers, funeral lyrics, romance songs and other old Romanian songs. The songs were recorded at the people’s home involved in the research, from several isolated villages from the Apuseni Mountains. Most of them have never been recorded before.  

Recordings during the first season of ethnographic research in the Apuseni Mountains, December 2014 - February 2015

The digital version of La Origini Audio Folklore Collection Season II will be delivered in March 2017 after processing the recordings scheduled for December 2016 - February 2017.

The Impact
 
On a long term basis this place will be used to organize thematic camps for learning traditional crafts and arts. The camps will be addressed to children, students, researchers and people passionate by organic architecture, ecological agriculture and permaculture, alternative energy and traditional crafts.Local artisans will teach us how to obtain tools using wood, stone or iron, how to create pottery using clay or how to weave or sew traditional clothing. We will practice all these crafts among other activities dedicated to folklore and musical instruments. So many songs, legends, myths and beliefs old for centuries are waiting for us!Seamstress teaching us how to spin a bundle of hemp during the ethnographic researchEvery winter we'll keep on organizing the ethnographic research. It's important to raise the awareness that we'll soon lose the elders who still keep memories from the second world war. They are an authentic source of folklore inherited from the past centuries: old songs, legends and stories. They are living history and it depends on us how fast we reach them. We can prevent this cultural legacy to disappear by recording and publishing their stories, learn them and teach them to the youngsters.The old priest from Tecsesti and his family plowing with oxen We want to highlight the positive impact that our project has over the local community and environment. By approaching such type of ecotourism and ecological activities we can preserve intact this protected area, avoiding demolition and exploitation of the forest and natural resources.Winter at TecsestiIn order to preserve the village by transforming it into a living museum, our plan for the next years is to renovate the school, a 200 years old traditional house and other 3 shelters. This way people who come to visit or live here for a period will always find shelter, healthy food and wild nature. It will be a place were we can learn history by living it.200 years old house from TecsestiWe want to build a place where we can develop our activities, where we can create and recreate ourselves, our home, our mythological locus amoenus. We believe that the village with its food, water and forests, with its agricultural or pastoral occupation, still remains the classic community which is the most creative source of essentially pure and authentic culture.Other Ways You Can HelpEither you are a contributor or you just like the project please share it with your friends on your blog, site, Facebook or another social media channel you use. We like to spread the word in the traditional oral way so please don't forget to talk about our project with your family, friends or acquaintances.Thank you!

the magical world of McKenzie Willis' Rainbow Forest for children everywhere
 within a high quality animation so that the rich and in depth world that Mr. Willis has created can finally be seen by all.<br/></p>
<p>Mr. Willis' “Tales of the Rainbow Forest” is uniquely mixed with
his “Songs of the Forest” to provide both
the reader and the audience a mesmerizing experience that mixes traditional
storytelling with musical interludes. The story introduces readers to the
important issues of bullying, and why we should re-focus our concentration on friendship, sharing, respecting and working together in a fun
and interesting way. While bullying is a heavy subject, Mr. Willis
creates a subtle approach so as not to overwhelm the book's audience of children, but still
teaches valuable lessons.</p>

</h3> <p></p>
<p><b>ENG</b>: It was
2012 when part of our team reached Morocco for the first time. We were looking
for ancient mines but wat we found was Aouam, its fortress and its huge mine,
exploited from pre-historic times till now. We found a forgotten place that
needs to be re discovered and promoted, but no-one can do this without
involving local dweller.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 2014,
we came back to Aouam and started working. We made a preliminary digging and we
worked closely with local institutions and associations, that asked us to
create a museum to help promoting their land: they want this museum to tell the
long story of Aouam and Tighza from pre-historic exploitation to modern times.
But there is a second aim to create this archaeo-mining museum: the population
of Aouam and Tighza, always connected to the mine since the beginning of their
history, are now suffering major occupational crisis connected to economic and
social problems. This is why the new museum will be not only a new way to link
people to their homeland and history, but also the engine for a true re-birth. </p>
<p>Thanks to
education courses and didactic laboratories, unemployed, young people and kids
will learn everything they need to manage and take care of the museum, starting
from French and everyday conservation of the objects, in order to work together
to promote the site to the major public, inside and outside Morocco. This is
why the project will be strongly linked to local school, one of the first
school of the area to accept both boys and girls. They will have the
opportunity to learn, play and grow in and with the museum.</p>
<p>Then the most
important part of our project will follow. We plan professional training for
local students, in order to involve them into management and promotion of their
heritage and let them act for the economic growth of their homeland. </p>
<p>Together with this,
we are planning cultural exchange with Italian schools, to complete
professional training of Moroccan students with an intensive month in Rome. When
this period will end, guys will be back in Morocco with brand new competences
and experiences to use at home. They will learn French,
Italian and English even in distance learning: other subjects will be history,
tourist managment, microeconomy and business management.</p>

qu’une partie de notre équipe s’est rendue au Maroc pour la première fois. À la
recherche de mines antiques, nous avons découvert Aouam, avec sa forteresse et
son immense mine, exploitée sans interruptions depuis la préhistoire. Nous
avons trouvé un monde oublié particulièrement riche et prometteur méritant
d’être redécouvert et valorisé, ce qui ne pouvait se faire qu’en collaboration
avec la population locale.</span>
</p>
<p>Nous sommes
revenus à Aouam en 2014 et nous avons commencé à travailler. Nous avons
effectué des fouilles préliminaires en opérant en étroite relation avec les
institutions et les associations locales, qui nous ont demandé de créer un
musée pour les aider à promouvoir leur territoire. Ce qu’ils veulent, c’est un
musée qui raconte la longue histoire d’Aouam et Tighza depuis la préhistoire
jusqu’à nos jours. Mais il y a une autre raison à la réalisation d’un parc
archéo-minier : la population d’Aouam et Tighza, qui a toujours vécu en étroite
relation avec la mine depuis ses origines jusqu’à présent, est actuellement
frappée par une crise importante due à la difficile situation économique et
sociale de la région. C’est pourquoi la création du parc et du musée permettrait
aux habitants de ces lieux non seulement de disposer d’un lieu accueillant
l’histoire et la mémoire de leur terre mais constituerait également l’instrument
d’une véritable renaissance et d’un futur possible pour les jeunes du pays</p>
<p>À l’intérieur
du musée, les enfants pourront suivre des cours et participer à des ateliers thématiques.
En effet, le projet fortement lié aux établissements scolaires locaux, et c’est
l’une des premières structure de la zone à accueillir à la fois filles et garçons.
Ceux-ci auront ainsi l’opportunité d’apprendre à lire, étudier, jouer et
grandir en contact avec leur musée, non interprété uniquement comme espace
destiné à héberger le passé, mais également comme lieu de vie pour construire
leur futur.</p>
<p>Le projet
comporte aussi un programme de formation professionnelle de personnel qualifié
choisi localement, dans l’objectif de l’insertion professionnelle des habitants
de la zone, afin qu’ils puissent acquérir les connaissances et les compétences
indispensables pour gérer et entretenir leur propre patrimoine culturel et
environnemental, et qu’ils soient les protagonistes du développement économique
et social de leur terre. Nous commencerons par l’enseignement et le
perfectionnement de la langue française et de la langue italienne, puis nous continuerons
par la conservation des biens culturels et naturels, et enfin, nous
travaillerons ensembles à la promotion du site au Maroc et à l’étranger. </p>
<p>Cette
importante phase du projet prévoit également des échanges culturels avec des
écoles italiennes d’orientation touristique pour pouvoir conclure la formation
des jeunes Marocains par un séjour d’étude en Italie, au terme duquel ils
retourneront dans leur pays avec un bagage complet de connaissances applicables
à la réalité locale. Les jeunes apprenants recevront une formation linguistique
en français, italien et anglais, entre autre à travers une plateforme de
formation à distance ; les matières plus spécifiquement professionnelles
comprendront non seulement l’histoire et la gestion touristique, mais également
la micro-économie et la gestion d’entreprise.</p>

squadra è approdata in Marocco per la prima volta. Eravamo alla ricerca di
miniere antiche e abbiamo scoperto Aouam, la sua fortezza et la sua immense
miniera, operativa sin dalla preistoria e tuttora attiva. Abbiamo trovato un
sito dimenticato che merita di essere riscoperto e promosso, con  il coinvolgimento però della popolazione
locale.</span>
</p>
<p>Nel 2014, siamo tornati ad Aouam e abbiamo
cominciato a lavorare. Abbiamo effettuato uno scavo preliminare e operato in
stretta collaborazione con le istituzioni ed associazioni locali, che ci hanno
chiesto di aiutarli a promuovere la loro terra: vogliono che un nuovo museo racconti
la lunga storia di  Aouam et Tighza dallo
sfruttamento preistorico iniziale fino ai giorni nostri. Vi è però un secondo
scopo nel realizzare questo museo archeominerario: la popolazione di Aouam et
Tighza,  la cui sorte è sempre stata
legatissima alla miniera sin dalla sua creazione, subisce attualmente una
fortissimo crisi occupazionale legata alla congiuntura economica. Per questo
motivo, la costruzione del museo non solo permetterà alla popolazione locale di
conservare la memoria della propria terra, ma sarà lo strumento di una vera e
propria rinascita, permettendo alle giovani generazioni di crearsi un futuro. </p>
<p>La nostra equipe preparerà lo svolgimento di
corrsi e laboratori tematici per i bambini e i ragazzi. Si tratta quindi di un
progetto fortemente legato alle scuole della zona, uno dei primi a rivolgersi
sia alle femmine che ai maschi. Potranno imparare a leggere, studiare, giocare
e crescere in stretto contatto con il loro museo, che sarà visto non come un
ripostiglio chiuso dove conservare l’eredità del passato, ma come luogo da
vivere per costruire il proprio futuro.</p>
<p>Ma soprattutto, oltre ai contenuti per le
scuole, il progetto comporta anche un programma di formazione professionale di personale
qualificato scelto in zona con l’obiettivo di inserire gli abitanti in un
contesto professionale, fornendo loro gli strumenti per acquisire le conoscenze
e le competenze indispensabili alla gestione al mantenimento del patrimonio
culturale e ambientale locale e per essere gli artefici dello sviluppo
economico e sociale della propria terra. 
Cominceremo con l’insegnamento e il perfezionamento della lingua francese
e della lingua italiana, continueremo con le materie legate alla conservazione
dei beni culturali ed ambientali, e infine lavoreremo insieme alla promozione
del sito in Marocco e all’estero.</p>
<p>In questo orizzonte sono in fase di
progettazioni eventuali scambi culturali con scuole italiane di turismo, per
poter concludere la formazione dei ragazzi marocchini con un periodo di studio
in Italia, al termine del quale i ragazzi torneranno nel loro paese con un  nuovo bagaglio completo di conoscenze
applicabili alla loro realtà locale. Ai ragazzi verrà insegnato, oltre al
francese, l’italiano e l’inglese utilizzando anche piattaforme di formazione a
distanza; le materie professionalizzanti non si limiteranno a quelle attinenti
la storia e la gestione turistica, ma comprenderanno anche microeconomia e
gestione d’impresa.</p>

ENG: It was
2012 when part of our team reached Morocco for the first time. We were looking
for ancient mines but wat we found was Aouam, its fortress and its huge mine,
exploited from pre-historic times till now. We found a forgotten place that
needs to be re discovered and promoted, but no-one can do this without
involving local dweller.

In 2014,
we came back to Aouam and started working. We made a preliminary digging and we
worked closely with local institutions and associations, that asked us to
create a museum to help promoting their land: they want this museum to tell the
long story of Aouam and Tighza from pre-historic exploitation to modern times.
But there is a second aim to create this archaeo-mining museum: the population
of Aouam and Tighza, always connected to the mine since the beginning of their
history, are now suffering major occupational crisis connected to economic and
social problems. This is why the new museum will be not only a new way to link
people to their homeland and history, but also the engine for a true re-birth. 
Thanks to
education courses and didactic laboratories, unemployed, young people and kids
will learn everything they need to manage and take care of the museum, starting
from French and everyday conservation of the objects, in order to work together
to promote the site to the major public, inside and outside Morocco. This is
why the project will be strongly linked to local school, one of the first
school of the area to accept both boys and girls. They will have the
opportunity to learn, play and grow in and with the museum.
Then the most
important part of our project will follow. We plan professional training for
local students, in order to involve them into management and promotion of their
heritage and let them act for the economic growth of their homeland. 
Together with this,
we are planning cultural exchange with Italian schools, to complete
professional training of Moroccan students with an intensive month in Rome. When
this period will end, guys will be back in Morocco with brand new competences
and experiences to use at home. They will learn French,
Italian and English even in distance learning: other subjects will be history,
tourist managment, microeconomy and business management.

FR: C’est en 2012
qu’une partie de notre équipe s’est rendue au Maroc pour la première fois. À la
recherche de mines antiques, nous avons découvert Aouam, avec sa forteresse et
son immense mine, exploitée sans interruptions depuis la préhistoire. Nous
avons trouvé un monde oublié particulièrement riche et prometteur méritant
d’être redécouvert et valorisé, ce qui ne pouvait se faire qu’en collaboration
avec la population locale.

Nous sommes
revenus à Aouam en 2014 et nous avons commencé à travailler. Nous avons
effectué des fouilles préliminaires en opérant en étroite relation avec les
institutions et les associations locales, qui nous ont demandé de créer un
musée pour les aider à promouvoir leur territoire. Ce qu’ils veulent, c’est un
musée qui raconte la longue histoire d’Aouam et Tighza depuis la préhistoire
jusqu’à nos jours. Mais il y a une autre raison à la réalisation d’un parc
archéo-minier : la population d’Aouam et Tighza, qui a toujours vécu en étroite
relation avec la mine depuis ses origines jusqu’à présent, est actuellement
frappée par une crise importante due à la difficile situation économique et
sociale de la région. C’est pourquoi la création du parc et du musée permettrait
aux habitants de ces lieux non seulement de disposer d’un lieu accueillant
l’histoire et la mémoire de leur terre mais constituerait également l’instrument
d’une véritable renaissance et d’un futur possible pour les jeunes du pays
À l’intérieur
du musée, les enfants pourront suivre des cours et participer à des ateliers thématiques.
En effet, le projet fortement lié aux établissements scolaires locaux, et c’est
l’une des premières structure de la zone à accueillir à la fois filles et garçons.
Ceux-ci auront ainsi l’opportunité d’apprendre à lire, étudier, jouer et
grandir en contact avec leur musée, non interprété uniquement comme espace
destiné à héberger le passé, mais également comme lieu de vie pour construire
leur futur.
Le projet
comporte aussi un programme de formation professionnelle de personnel qualifié
choisi localement, dans l’objectif de l’insertion professionnelle des habitants
de la zone, afin qu’ils puissent acquérir les connaissances et les compétences
indispensables pour gérer et entretenir leur propre patrimoine culturel et
environnemental, et qu’ils soient les protagonistes du développement économique
et social de leur terre. Nous commencerons par l’enseignement et le
perfectionnement de la langue française et de la langue italienne, puis nous continuerons
par la conservation des biens culturels et naturels, et enfin, nous
travaillerons ensembles à la promotion du site au Maroc et à l’étranger. 
Cette
importante phase du projet prévoit également des échanges culturels avec des
écoles italiennes d’orientation touristique pour pouvoir conclure la formation
des jeunes Marocains par un séjour d’étude en Italie, au terme duquel ils
retourneront dans leur pays avec un bagage complet de connaissances applicables
à la réalité locale. Les jeunes apprenants recevront une formation linguistique
en français, italien et anglais, entre autre à travers une plateforme de
formation à distance ; les matières plus spécifiquement professionnelles
comprendront non seulement l’histoire et la gestion touristique, mais également
la micro-économie et la gestion d’entreprise.


IT: È nel 2012 che una parte della nostra
squadra è approdata in Marocco per la prima volta. Eravamo alla ricerca di
miniere antiche e abbiamo scoperto Aouam, la sua fortezza et la sua immense
miniera, operativa sin dalla preistoria e tuttora attiva. Abbiamo trovato un
sito dimenticato che merita di essere riscoperto e promosso, con  il coinvolgimento però della popolazione
locale.

Nel 2014, siamo tornati ad Aouam e abbiamo
cominciato a lavorare. Abbiamo effettuato uno scavo preliminare e operato in
stretta collaborazione con le istituzioni ed associazioni locali, che ci hanno
chiesto di aiutarli a promuovere la loro terra: vogliono che un nuovo museo racconti
la lunga storia di  Aouam et Tighza dallo
sfruttamento preistorico iniziale fino ai giorni nostri. Vi è però un secondo
scopo nel realizzare questo museo archeominerario: la popolazione di Aouam et
Tighza,  la cui sorte è sempre stata
legatissima alla miniera sin dalla sua creazione, subisce attualmente una
fortissimo crisi occupazionale legata alla congiuntura economica. Per questo
motivo, la costruzione del museo non solo permetterà alla popolazione locale di
conservare la memoria della propria terra, ma sarà lo strumento di una vera e
propria rinascita, permettendo alle giovani generazioni di crearsi un futuro. 
La nostra equipe preparerà lo svolgimento di
corrsi e laboratori tematici per i bambini e i ragazzi. Si tratta quindi di un
progetto fortemente legato alle scuole della zona, uno dei primi a rivolgersi
sia alle femmine che ai maschi. Potranno imparare a leggere, studiare, giocare
e crescere in stretto contatto con il loro museo, che sarà visto non come un
ripostiglio chiuso dove conservare l’eredità del passato, ma come luogo da
vivere per costruire il proprio futuro.
Ma soprattutto, oltre ai contenuti per le
scuole, il progetto comporta anche un programma di formazione professionale di personale
qualificato scelto in zona con l’obiettivo di inserire gli abitanti in un
contesto professionale, fornendo loro gli strumenti per acquisire le conoscenze
e le competenze indispensabili alla gestione al mantenimento del patrimonio
culturale e ambientale locale e per essere gli artefici dello sviluppo
economico e sociale della propria terra. 
Cominceremo con l’insegnamento e il perfezionamento della lingua francese
e della lingua italiana, continueremo con le materie legate alla conservazione
dei beni culturali ed ambientali, e infine lavoreremo insieme alla promozione
del sito in Marocco e all’estero.
In questo orizzonte sono in fase di
progettazioni eventuali scambi culturali con scuole italiane di turismo, per
poter concludere la formazione dei ragazzi marocchini con un periodo di studio
in Italia, al termine del quale i ragazzi torneranno nel loro paese con un  nuovo bagaglio completo di conoscenze
applicabili alla loro realtà locale. Ai ragazzi verrà insegnato, oltre al
francese, l’italiano e l’inglese utilizzando anche piattaforme di formazione a
distanza; le materie professionalizzanti non si limiteranno a quelle attinenti
la storia e la gestione turistica, ma comprenderanno anche microeconomia e
gestione d’impresa.

   What We Need & What We Get - Ce qu’il nous faut & et ce que nous en faisons - Che cosa ci serve e che cosa
ne facciamo
 ENG: The AIM, together with
CNR, will organize couses and laboratories in Aouam. Mining company of Tighza
(CMT), with the Association Abghour
Puor le Developpement, the Association Tighza Atlas and local schools will give us some rooms for our classes.

What we need is furniture and tools. Our aim is
to gain 3000€ to buy teaching aids, computers, a printer, paper, crayons, books
to create a little library of economy, history and archaeology, and everything
we may need during our training courses and in laboratories, such as internet
connection. All the money gained, whether we manage to reach the entire goal or
not, will be used to buy learning supplies.

FR: L’ AIM, en
collaboration avec le CNR, réalisera l’Ecomusée d’Aouam-Tighza pour y
accueillir l’importante histoire locale et offrir un futur aux jeunes résidents.
La compagnie minière de  Tighza (CMT), en
association avec l'Association Abghour Puor le Developpement et l'Association Tighza Atlas nous réservera un bâtiment pour y organiser le musée, où
héberger le patrimoine archéologique. Il comprendra également une salle de conférence
pour y organiser des cours et des ateliers ; des cours seront également organisés
dans les écoles locales.

Nous avons besoin de meubles et de matériel. Notre but est de rassembler 3000 euros pour pouvoir acheter du matériel didactique, des ordinateurs, une
imprimante, du papier, des stylos, des livres, afin de créer une petite
bibliothèque contenant des manuels d’histoire, d’archéologie et d’économie, et
tout ce qui nous sert pour les cours de formation et  les activités dans les ateliers, y compris
une connexion Internet. Tout l’argent recueilli, que nous atteignons ou non le
montant fixé, servira à acheter du matériel didactique.

IT: L‘AIM, insieme al CNR, si occuperà dei corsi
in Marocco. La società mineraria di Tighza (CMT), insieme alle associazioni Abghour Puor le Developpement e Tighza
Atlas e alle scuole locali, forniranno i locali per lo svolgimento di lezioni
e laboratori.

Quello che ci
serve è mobilio et strumenti. Il nostro scopo è di raggiungere 3000 euro per comprare
materiale didattico, computer, una stampante, carta, penne, libri per creare
una piccolo biblioteca di economia, storia ed archeologia, e tutto ciò che possa
servire per i corsi di formazione e i laboratori, come una connessione
Internet. Tutto il denaro ricevuto, se raggiungeremo o no la soglia fissata,
sarà speso per comprare materiale didattico.

And the trend in program development for girls’ enrichment is around STEM and STEAM. Often these programs are missing a key programmatic complement around the ownership and community use (and integration) of technology and innovation. FOR ""WHO"": INSPIRE HER TO BE A SheEO®“Don’t worry about being successful, but work towards being significant and the success will naturally follow.” ~Oprah WinfreyArticles, studies and successful CEOs all say we need to encourage more girls to...*problem solve & innovate*understand business & financial literacy*develop and pursue their vision*explore and discuss leadership & entrepreneurship She-EO, LLC provides FIVE opportunities for girls to do ALL OF THAT while introducing them to other like-minded girls to 1) mastermind, 2) set goals, and 3) have fun. Camp SheEO® <> SheEO® Academy <> Club SheEO® <> SheEO® Coaching  SheEO® Birthday Parties HOW & NOW: EMPOWERING SheEO®s EVERYWHERE""BE the change you want to see in the world."" ~GhandiEntrepreneurs use their talents and passion 1) to create useful things 2) that make a difference and 3) contribute to a thriving community.

                     OUR FOUNDER
                                           
                 I love being both a medical doctor and minister! It’s a wonderful gift from God to be able to heal and serve others and see people restored to health, body, mind and soul.         In the five years since God first led me to begin ministering to the sick and injured in the hospitals in of the San Francisco area, I have seen many healing miracles of God with the sickest patients. I have also seen incredible transformation of people's lives.TESTIMONIESHere are a few of the incredible cases of God’s supernatural miracle healings that I have seen in my healing ministry.Quadriplegic walks! I prayed for a man who was in a nearly fatal car collision and broke his neck. He was admitted to the hospital ICU on full life support as a quadriplegic, with no movement or feeling below the neck and shoulders. Normally, he would have to spend his life in a wheelchair.With prayer, God healed him very rapidly. He was discharged from the hospital already walking again. He is now bowling and starting to run which is normally impossible for quadriplegics to do.Critical Brain Injury Recovers. I prayed for a five year old girl who was in the pediatric ICU. She was in a car crash and had a very serious brain injury. Her doctors had to cut a hole in her skull and and insert a plastic drain tube to relieve intracranial pressure. She was in a coma for three weeks and had fractures of  her arm and jaw.     As I prayed for her, God healed and blessed her. She began to talk and interact again and was up walking very quickly. She went home with no sign of brain injury a month before her expected date of leaving the hospital.Shortened, withered arm lengthens and heals. I love this case of an 85 year old man who I prayed for who had a withered right arm that was paralyzed and much shorter than his left arm. His daughter said that his arm had always been that way and that he had never had the use of that arm.     With prayer and the power of God, his right arm suddenly grew out to the size and length of the left arm and he regained movement in the paralyzed arm.                                           Unbearable pain is gone. I ministered to a man who was in constant pain and could hardly walk due to severe injury to his knees. The cartilage was so worn down that he had bone grinding on bone. Knee surgery had failed and he couldn't work at construction, his regular job. After healing prayer, the pain was totally gone and he can now walk easily and even work again.Severe deafness healed. I prayed for a man who was in the hospital and suffered from severe hearing loss. He was deaf in both ears and could barely hear, even if you stood right next to him, literally shouting into his ears. With healing prayer, his hearing returned and he could hear perfectly, even at a distance!Radical weight loss. I love seeing cases of God’s supernatural weight loss. I prayed for a man who weighed 700 pounds and was morbidly obese. He was in the hospital ICU on life support and had only a 30% chance of surviving. I prayed for him and he lost almost 250 pounds in less than 1 month.This is medically impossible and was a total miracle of God.


Received two new cars, God’s double portion. “I requested prayer from Dr. Susan for a vehicle because we were in desperate need of a car and today we were blessed with not only one but 2 new vehicles. Used but new to us and very low miles""God opens doors for multiple jobs. God blessed a woman who I recently prayed for: “Opportunities are knocking after a year of unemployment!... I am the most anointed administrator, manager and executive in Jesus Name, amen!""God brings financial prosperity to a snack stand. I was at a mall shopping when I saw a snack stand that was selling pretzels and other snack foods. I was the only customer at the stand and the owners looked very unhappy. They told me that they were very worried because they weren't getting the foot traffic that they needed to survive.     I offered to pray over the snack stand and they gratefully accepted my offer. Afterwards, I was thrilled that people were coming up to the stand and ordering food. After having seven new customers, they came out and loaded me up with food as a thank you. I left marveling at the incredible grace and goodness of God!OUR NEED, YOUR BENEFIT!
 


   We need to raise $500,000 for startup costs in order to hire staff and faculty, cover facilities costs, and other initial costs that come with starting our school.     By becoming a partner, we want to transform and empower your life, too! You will receive gifts that will help you to create the life of your dreams and support you in your intimacy and walk with God.",24.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><i>As a Consciousness-Coach I already help many people to claim back their own power in their lives to live a more healthy, abundant, happy life on all levels! </i> </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Als Grundlage dafür dient meine bisherige Ausbildung sowie jahrzehntelange eigene Lebenserfahrung. An meine Klienten stelle ich den gleichen hohen Anspruch, wie an mich selbst: die Dinge <i>im Leben umzusetzen und zu leben</i> und nicht nur weiteres Wissen anzuhäufen und es als Konzept und Vorstellung im Kopf zu behalten. Viele Menschen - die meisten - haben ein unglaubliches Wissen, aber nur die allerwenigstens <i>können es auch wirklich <b>umsetzen</b></i>. Und genau das ist mein Anstreben! Ich helfe den Menschen bei der Umsetzung.</p>
<p><i>My coaching is based on my previous trainings and qualifications with lots of well known people who helped me getting into and claiming back my own power. So I can look back on years and years of lived and integrated life experiences. I've done and tried it all on myself first until I coach others on how to achieve their goals. For me that is the only way to authenticity. And that is my interest: that people come into their own realization and not keeping all this knowledge just in their heads as a concept or as a believe. So many people - most of them - have a lot of knowledge but only a very few are able to <b>really implement</b> all this in their everyday lives. That's where my coaching begins!</i>    </p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Es muss im Alltag anwendbar sein</b>, in jeder Situation, und zwar auf natürlichste Weise aus dem tiefsten innersten Selbst, und nicht antrainiert oder angelernt, denn das ist nicht von Dauer und geht sehr schnell schief, da es nur ein weiteres künstliches Konzept war, das nie verinnerlicht und begriffen wurde.</p>
<p><i>It must be applicable in the everyday life, in any situation, to emerge from the true inner balanced self in the most natural way; not in an acquired or trained way which would only cover things up that are not truly internalized and realized. And rather sooner than later this will go wrong because it was just another artificial concept and not truly integrated.</i></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>Mein Ziel ist es</b>, da<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">ss jeder Mensch in der Lage ist, in seinem Leben </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">unbegründetes</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Wohlbefinden</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> zu erfahren - </span><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">frei von Ängsten, von Blockaden, von alten und/oder übernommenen Vorstellungen und ungehindert seinen angestrebten Zielen entgegengehen kann, ob beruflich oder privat</i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">; ein Wohlbefinden, das aus dem tiefsten Inneren eines jeden Einzelnen kommt und nicht mehr von äußeren Dingen und Menschen abhängig ist, weil genau das in hohem Maße automatisch zu mehr Fülle, einer stabilen Gesundheit, mehr Erfolg, mehr Glück im Außen und damit im Leben führt. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Was wäre, wenn du deine größten Blockaden, wie Ängste, Zweifel usw., die dich in niedrigen Frequenzbereichen halten, <i>sofort</i> <i>auflösen</i> <i>könntest</i>, um automatisch in höhere Frequenzbereiche zu kommen, sodass du frei deinen Zielen entgegen gehen kannst? </span></p>
<p><i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>It is my goal </b>that everyone is </span>able to live and experience uncaused wellbeing in <i>their lives - free from fears, free from blocks, free from old believes that are mostly taken over from other people or family members but which are ultimately not yours at all - so that you can go unhindered towards your goals - no matter if it is a private or a business goal. It is a wellbeing that emerges from deep within of each and everyone and is not influenced by outer circumstances. This will automatically <i>lead</i> to more abundance, more stability, more health, more wellbeing in the life of each and everyone. <b>What if </b>you could eliminate and resolve your biggest fears and blocks and doubts in an instant to automatically access higher frequencies that automatically lead to a more fulfilled and abundant life on all kind of levels?  </i></i></p>
<p><i><i><br/></i></i></p>
<p><b>Mit der Ausbildung ""Instant Miracle Mastery""</b> kann ich dies für alle Menschen, die zu mir kommen, bereitstellen, sodass jeder ungehindert und somit <i>schneller </i>zu seinem Ziel gelangen kann! Auch wenn dies vorher für denjenigen unmöglich schien.</p>
<p><i><b>That's why I really want to be part of the training ""Instant Miracle Mastery.""</b> It comes from a deep inner knowingness and passion that things can be far more easy for all of us to start to thrive in our lives!

As a Consciousness-Coach I already help many people to claim back their own power in their lives to live a more healthy, abundant, happy life on all levels!  

Als Grundlage dafür dient meine bisherige Ausbildung sowie jahrzehntelange eigene Lebenserfahrung. An meine Klienten stelle ich den gleichen hohen Anspruch, wie an mich selbst: die Dinge im Leben umzusetzen und zu leben und nicht nur weiteres Wissen anzuhäufen und es als Konzept und Vorstellung im Kopf zu behalten. Viele Menschen - die meisten - haben ein unglaubliches Wissen, aber nur die allerwenigstens können es auch wirklich umsetzen. Und genau das ist mein Anstreben! Ich helfe den Menschen bei der Umsetzung.
My coaching is based on my previous trainings and qualifications with lots of well known people who helped me getting into and claiming back my own power. So I can look back on years and years of lived and integrated life experiences. I've done and tried it all on myself first until I coach others on how to achieve their goals. For me that is the only way to authenticity. And that is my interest: that people come into their own realization and not keeping all this knowledge just in their heads as a concept or as a believe. So many people - most of them - have a lot of knowledge but only a very few are able to really implement all this in their everyday lives. That's where my coaching begins!    

Es muss im Alltag anwendbar sein, in jeder Situation, und zwar auf natürlichste Weise aus dem tiefsten innersten Selbst, und nicht antrainiert oder angelernt, denn das ist nicht von Dauer und geht sehr schnell schief, da es nur ein weiteres künstliches Konzept war, das nie verinnerlicht und begriffen wurde.
It must be applicable in the everyday life, in any situation, to emerge from the true inner balanced self in the most natural way; not in an acquired or trained way which would only cover things up that are not truly internalized and realized. And rather sooner than later this will go wrong because it was just another artificial concept and not truly integrated.

Mein Ziel ist es, dass jeder Mensch in der Lage ist, in seinem Leben unbegründetes Wohlbefinden zu erfahren - frei von Ängsten, von Blockaden, von alten und/oder übernommenen Vorstellungen und ungehindert seinen angestrebten Zielen entgegengehen kann, ob beruflich oder privat; ein Wohlbefinden, das aus dem tiefsten Inneren eines jeden Einzelnen kommt und nicht mehr von äußeren Dingen und Menschen abhängig ist, weil genau das in hohem Maße automatisch zu mehr Fülle, einer stabilen Gesundheit, mehr Erfolg, mehr Glück im Außen und damit im Leben führt. Was wäre, wenn du deine größten Blockaden, wie Ängste, Zweifel usw., die dich in niedrigen Frequenzbereichen halten, sofort auflösen könntest, um automatisch in höhere Frequenzbereiche zu kommen, sodass du frei deinen Zielen entgegen gehen kannst? 
It is my goal that everyone is able to live and experience uncaused wellbeing in their lives - free from fears, free from blocks, free from old believes that are mostly taken over from other people or family members but which are ultimately not yours at all - so that you can go unhindered towards your goals - no matter if it is a private or a business goal. It is a wellbeing that emerges from deep within of each and everyone and is not influenced by outer circumstances. This will automatically lead to more abundance, more stability, more health, more wellbeing in the life of each and everyone. What if you could eliminate and resolve your biggest fears and blocks and doubts in an instant to automatically access higher frequencies that automatically lead to a more fulfilled and abundant life on all kind of levels?  

Mit der Ausbildung ""Instant Miracle Mastery"" kann ich dies für alle Menschen, die zu mir kommen, bereitstellen, sodass jeder ungehindert und somit schneller zu seinem Ziel gelangen kann! Auch wenn dies vorher für denjenigen unmöglich schien.
That's why I really want to be part of the training ""Instant Miracle Mastery."" It comes from a deep inner knowingness and passion that things can be far more easy for all of us to start to thrive in our lives! So many things in our lives don't serve us anymore but we get stuck in them and it is my intention that we don't spend a whole life and all the money on going to different therapists and going through years and years of therapy. There has to be an Easy Button - and I know and experienced there is!

Ihr als Unterstützer helft mir dabei, dies für viele, viele Menschen möglich zu machen und somit tragt ihr in hohem Maße dazu bei, dass immer mehr und mehr Menschen eine vollkommen neue Lebensqualität (und dadurch Motivation in Berufs- und Privatleben) durch mehr Fülle und mehr Wohlbefinden in ihrem Leben erfahren, frei von Blockaden, die oft die ganze Fülle und Lebensfreude verhindern, und damit kann sich wiederum auch das Gesamtbewusstsein der Menschen auf diesem Planeten schrittweise ändern kann. Denn jeder Mensch ist in der Lage, wieder in seine ganze Freude und Kraft zu kommen und zu seinem eigenen wahren Potenzialen zu erwachen.

As a supporter you help me in so many ways that I can be of service for many, many people and for you if you so choose! More and more people will gain a much higher quality of life that is based on a deep inner, natural wellbeing and they will be motivated in so many new ways to enjoy their life anew, free from blocks and fears that have held them back artificially. And this in itself contributes to the mass consciousness that can also change in many more ways to more joy, more ease, more abundance, more uncaused wellbeing. It is a positive spiral and it will affect each and everyone. Everybody is able to awaken to their full potential in their lives.

<h3>Story</h3>
<p>My name is Mila Walker. I grew up in a remote area in the Philippines, where childhood labor was rampant and some children were forced not to go to school and obliged to work anywhere for extra family income.  I was one of the lucky one who made it to school to attain higher education. I always thought about my childhood friends who did not make it out because of poverty. They were stuck; their children stuck and the generation after them in the same situation. I am married to Henry Walker, from Louisiana, USA, who was an orphan. He grew up in an orphanage called ""Blandon Home"". His testimony was always ""because of others who have a heart of gold from God, he is the person he is now"". After 22 years of serving his country Henry retired from the United States Army. We visited my hometown in the Philippines in 2000 and he saw the hardship of the people and the growing numbers of ""street children"". This condition touches our hearts which lead to the founding of Ezra Ministry, a non-profit, non-government organization in 2004. EZRA formulates effective programs and services to address the present condition of the people specially the displaced and indigent families and to encourage them to grow in God's grace. We turned our ""vacation house"" into a temporary shelter for the fourteen displaced children and we open a Christian school for them and other less fortunate children in the community seeking free education.  We solely funded all the expenses (from our savings and retirement income), but as the children grow older, their grade level gets higher, and their needs get bigger! The government allowed us to use the unfinished school building as long as we continue to build and give 10 years to complete. We cannot afford to do it alone and we are seeking other kind hearted people to help us. </p>

The cheap stuff from the dollar store has nothing on our dreams, even though many of the treasures start at just 50 cents!With your donation we will be able to visit their showroom and pick out all sorts of smile inducing treasures to make many sick boys and girls very happy.   In fact, there are many clinics that don't even have treasure boxes but with your help they will soon have to find space for what we can deliver.The only obstacle standing in our way is finding enough moms to help us drive the boxes down to the hospital! If you could help us, please make a donation of any amount and we promise to spend your money wisely by packing in amazing toys and treats that will bring smiles and last a lot longer than the pain of their appointment or treatment. Kids may not want to go to their treatment or appointments but, they will be extremely happy when it's time to leave, especially when they have something fun to hold onto and it didn't cost their parents a dime! Thank you for blessing sick kids of every age with a smile!",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hullo mates, my name is Salim Blanden. I'm 30 years and i live in Mbarara in Western Uganda. I'm also the founder of Mbarara Sports Academy; a community focused initiative that has been using football since 2010 to increase the number of children entering school in the communities around Mbarara District. In 2009 when i went back home for a holiday from school, i found so many young children playing football the whole day while others were at school, interacting with the kids and the people around, they told me some kids lost their parents from HIV/AIDS while the rest came from very poor backgrounds that even if they had both parents, these parents could not afford to pay any school fees for them because they did not have jobs to do.</p>
<p>The only thing that came into my mind was to start a football team and train them so that they can start attending school. I would do this by identifying schools around Mbarara that give sports scholarships to talented participants. My dream came to reality and i started Mbarara Sports Academy a year later on February 2010. Almost seven years on, over 300 participants have been able to get scholarships in different schools around the country. And today, 90% of participants both boys and girls attend school through our sports programs.</p>
<p>In 2013, i was awarded as the 'First community Impact Coach of Uganda and second in Africa by Coaches Across Continents'(CAC). Coaches Across Continents is a global Organization that uses sports as vehicle for social change(<a href=""http://www.coachesacrosscontinents.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.coachesacrosscontinents.org</a>)</p>
<p>With the increasing number of kids missing out on attending school in my community because of various reasons like poverty and HIV/AIDS, i have decided to start a school building project to help reduce the number of kids and young people missing school. At the moment, we have already secured enough land to build a school and a play ground and some work has already began and we are already making bricks to use for building. The school will help hundreds of kids in Mbarara district and other young people from outside Mbarara to achieve an education while playing to have fun.<br/></p>
<p>With the contributions from you, we would be able to make this dream a reality. We are a transparent organization based on truth. We therefore request for your contributions towards this cause.<br/></p>we need USD200,000 for buildings to accommodate participants and a play ground. We need to involve more females to get an education through this school by giving them a chance to play and lead.<br/><br/>I'm a point person in my community and a FUFA football delegate in Mbarara district therefore its an advantage for me to reach out to many young people to support them academically using football and sports.<br/>
</div>My project would be valuable to the community of Mbarara and to the whole country because we intend to educate very many young people and equip them with the skills to change our community and make it a better place for other young people to live.  The contributors would also get a chance to be part of this development by visiting and having a free home to reside while they come for visiting the country, they would also meet and interact with many kids and young people and learn more from other cultures.<br/> <div>
<br/>There are so many challenges however, the first being finance. It's very difficult to build and do other organization activities without finance. However, much as this is a big challenge, i will continue with the little finances i earn from training footballers in other schools.<br/>
</div>If you can't contribute, please spread the word and talk to other people about this cause. This will help the world learn about this great cause and maybe ask other people to contribute in future with whatever they can get.<br/><br/>If you can contribute, we are more than grateful!<br/><br/>Thank you!<br/><br/>Salim Blanden Founder/Director<br/><br/></div>","Hullo mates, my name is Salim Blanden.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I'm Joanne, a writer, mum of two amazing kids and Creator of God for Kids app. I believe it is important for parents to share their faith with their children and tell of the great things God has done, just like the Bible says. So I created God for Kids app to do exactly that and help other parents do the same in a fun, user-friendly way that builds both family and faith.</p>
<p><i>""I have no greater joy than to hear my children walk in truth"" (3 John 1:4)</i></p>
<p>I know I'm not alone - there are so many grown-ups like you who are passionate about seeing their kids grow in faith in Jesus. You can now be a part of this adventure. </p>
<p>God for kids app teaches kids who God is and what God is like. We have already made the desert adventure which focuses on the personal characteristics of God and the space adventure which focuses on the huge, big, omni, Father characteristics of God. Now it's time for the garden adventure to show who Jesus is, what Jesus is like and how Jesus reveals the Father to us. If we exceed our goal and raise £12,000 together we can complete the Trinity Adventures and create the underwater adventure based on the Holy Spirit and how He helps us to live like Jesus. </p>
<p>I need you to help God for Kids app be a complete and full reflection of who God really is and what God is really like. Every adventure is based on what God has already revealed to us through the Bible. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Our Overall Costs:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Jesus Adventure will have 7 featured stops on a map of a garden. Each feature usually costs £1000 plus £200 for conversion to android. But this time, those who write the code have offered a huge discount. So, including all other marketing and graphics fees, it will cost just <strong>£700 per 'Featured-Stop</strong>' to create the Jesus Adventure. Amazing! </li>
<li>If we do not reach our goal of £6,000, we will build as many as featured stops as we can afford. Then, as funds increase through in-app purchases, we will build the next 'Feature-Stop' till we are finished.</li>
<li>If we exceed our goal, For every £700 over, we will create one stop on the 'God with Us' Underwater Adventure. A total of £12,000 altogether will complete the app entirely!</li>
<li>Anything over £12,000 will be used to tell more people about God for Kids app.  </li>
</ul>
<p>Other costs included in the £6,000 goal:</p>
<ul>
<li>8-10% of your gift goes towards Indegogo's platform fees and card payment transactions. </li>

My name is Vicente (Vince) Lujan. I'm a bilingual liturgical musician and praise and worship leader. From my work  as a parish youth minister, workshop presenter, and professional musician at live music concerts and liturgies, my goal has been to  build and cross bridges that span the gap between the English and Spanish speaking communities within the church.I'm part of the bilingual music ministry 'Jesus Team A' which was founded by my long time friend and songwriting partner Manuel Bravo.

<p>Barbershop Studio (BS) Playset is inspired by the desire to create an answer to the growing concern about our youth and young adult’s challenges to communicate effectively, engage and socialize with parents, friends, teachers and employers. This is a <strong>CALL TO ACTION! </strong> Our action is <strong>PREVENTION</strong>. Our Action is to do away with the <strong>INEFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION</strong> by younger millennials as they grow and mature into young adults. We are introducing social skills at a younger age.</p>
<p>Our Barbershop Studio will support young boys in learning at an early age how to socially interact across generations and remove communication barriers that are experienced today. <strong>How you may ask? </strong>Through meaningful and imaginative play in this realistic barbershop environment, growth in social and emotional skills will be fostered.</p>
<p>A peer-reviewed journal, Psychology in the Schools, published an article in 2004, which examined dimensions of peer play. What it showed is that children exhibiting high levels of peer play interaction were found to demonstrate more competent emotional-regulation, initiation, self-determination, and receptive vocabulary skills.<br/>Patricia M Greenfield, a distinguished professor of psychology at UCLA and senior author of the study said that ""decreased sensitivity to emotional cues is one of the costs of the use of digital media… The displacement of in person social interaction by screen interactions seems to be reducing social skills.""</p>
<p><strong>Bringing Barbershop Studio to market will support educational centers and parents in nurturing socially and emotionally healthy children. </strong>To address this critical need, I am working to raise $10,000. <strong>Your donation</strong> will be <strong>utilized </strong>to develop an authentic brand in order to bring Barbershop Studio to market. The branding will secure a trademark, which will aid in the plight to secure a manufacturing, distribution or licensing partnership. It is my dream that Barbershop Studio will be in homes, daycare centers and barbershops around the world. After all, it is play that stimulates creativity.</p>
<p>Your contribution towards funding today will help further develop a product that can assist in relieving the anxiety a child may feel during their first visit to the barbershop. It will help stimulate children’s imaginations and development of social skills, which in turn builds character and confidence. Barbershop Studio will revitalize interaction through meaningful play.<br/> </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I believe so deeply in this idea that I have personally funded the development and marketing costs to date. After participating in INPEX, an inventors and new product tradeshow in June 2016 and June 2017, I knew I had a strong product to bring to the market.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Hassan ""Dr. Pooch"" Diop. I'm not a traditional doctor yet but I am a Certified Holistic Health Coach and continue to further my studies in natural medicine. For years I've also been a poet/songwriter. Over time the two merged and created a one-of-a-kind health-oriented children's book series! </p>
<p>The main character Johnny Mustache, is black and latino, which represents the demographics most afflicted with chronic illness and obesity. The books engage lower income community children to be health conscious. By creating ""little health coaches"" in homes around the country, children will hold their parents accountable to the memorable lines they read and become co-creators of a healthier environment for us all.</p>
<p>Just today I met with the principal of a south L.A elementary who told me kids are being rushed to hospitals because a popular red hot chip concoction. more popular among hispanic children, is destroying their stomach lining! One principal told me her main problem was to hire nurses who knows how to administer insulin to children! We need a change. By teaching kids to be better custodians of their bodies and the earth, it will be a better future for us all.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I am humbly asking for $15,000. This is going to developing the 6 books left to complete the series. The remainder is going to printing and marketing for the existing 6 on the market. I can get competitive prices if printing in bulk. Thus far I've been printing from CreateSpace and pay too much to keep my price affordable for the low-income communities that really need this material.  The more books I can have available for children, the more schools/families I can get them to. The Los Angeles Unified School District is the 2nd largest in the U.S. They have expressed a great need for this type of material. </p>
<p>Of course we don't set out to fail but, if we fall short of our goal, the funds that have been generated are going to printing. As an independent publisher the main priority is to have BOOKS.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, many S. Los Angeles kids live in low-income communities in what we call ""food deserts"", where access to healthy food options are almost non-existent.  Teaching children health concepts expands their minds, fortifies their bodies and gives them a far better chance at success in today's world. Not only is there a lack of holistic health material on the children's book market but there's also a lack of diversity in book characters. This project is a one stop holistic gem that addresses the most important health concepts in a fun edu-taining way. Dr. Seuss had a great run, but instead Green Eggs and Ham, Dr. Pooch is introducing kids to slightly healthier options.</p>
<p>From Michelle Obama to Aja Brown from our own local government, all have personally expressed the importance of this project. I need your help to succeed. To succeed would mean changing kids lives!!!!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I am venturing into markets that have yet to be tapped into. I am merging the children's book market and the global health and wellness market into one product. I believe we are in the perfect climate to release books/curriculum of this nature to children. I have conducted workshops, speaking engagements and book readings in over 25 schools in Los Angeles County and maintain good relationships with their principals and educators. I've yet to meet an educator that hasn't expressed great interest and need for my books.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>This campaign deals with the two most important things in our adult lives: Health and children. Those are two things that we all care about. Send this campaign to someone who has a voice/reach far greater mine. Get this in front of a celebrity that can not only sponsor but be an ambassador to this project.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Sharing one’s story has long been an empowering practice for survivors of domestic and sexual violence. Amid a culture where survivors are still stigmatized, shamed, and blamed, sharing one’s experience is an act of radical reclaiming of one’s narrative and life. Since 2013, the multimedia, online sharing platform <strong>Surviving In Numbers has provided a safe and anonymous place</strong> for survivors to share their experiences within a community that accepts and empowers.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478975134/quze5wrmx9vzdzoaiykf.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>To keep changing the culture, <strong>survivors need even more</strong>. With your help, we will build an entirely new website to provide an improved platform for survivors to continue to safely share their voices, be part of a community, and seek support. You’ll also help us build the new Project Thrive component of Surviving In Numbers, which will extend this impact even further, reaching survivors who have not yet been able to speak their truth, share their stories, and begin their process of healing.</p>
<p><strong>Project Thrive</strong> will be a multimedia platform consisting of written blogs and video content capturing the diverse array of survivor narratives of healing, resilience, and thriving. The content will be captured by our staff, as well as through submissions from survivors themselves. The content will eventually become a full-length feature film that could be used for educational purposes, extending the impact of partnering organizations beyond Surviving in Numbers.</p>

Rachel's been accepted to her dream school for Fall 2016. It's a one semester residency program that teaches all of the major disciplines in an art immersion environment. She'll be able to work with world class artists and learn with students from all over the world. She couldn't be more thrilled. 

Unfortunately, the school no longer has financial aid available at this time. As a result, we're having to get creative and develop our own aid package. Friends kindly asked me to create this crowdfunding campaign to help me to send Rachel to her dream school this Fall.
   What We Need The program cost including housing, food, supplies, all of the classroom teaching, after school supervision, and overnight caretakers costs $26,500. Additionally she'll be continuing her French education for another $750. 

In total that means we need $27,250 to cover her education with world class artists. 

    The Impact Rachel has already built a great foundation in the arts. 

She performed in the annual school play, Almost Maine, this year.

She's had short films in both the Sonoma International Film Festival and the Portland Youth Film Festival. She's also held a Videography Internship with the men of Ask a Winemaker at the International Pinot Noir Celebration, and served as the makeup artist for multiple student films. 

Rachel's work in film, makeup arts, and theatre was part of what earned her a place in her new art program.

    Risks & Challenges 
In the art program, Rachel will get to develop her own multi-disciplinary art education while also learning geography, world culture, the sciences and writing disciplines alongside top students from around the world. 

Any funds raised will be used towards the cost of the program. 

We'll be seeking other scholarships and funding options as well. It's harder though to find financial aid for high school than for college, which is why we need your help.

We are also able to make payments over the course of the semester if needed. 

I'll be working hard to earn extra income to contribute to the cost of the program, as well as seeking any high school scholarships or loans we can find. 

Any of your contributions will make a huge difference for both of us. 

    Other Ways You Can Help We understand not everyone can afford to contribute. Your encouragement and support is always appreciated. Most of all we're so grateful for your friendship.

<h3>Where is Kovno? </h3>
<p>Where is Kovno?  has been invited to exhibit at the Johannesburg Holocaust and Genocide Centre in April 2017.  Many South African Jews have Lithuanian ancestry and yet do not know much of the details of their Lithuanian heritage. Lithuanian Jews (Litvaks) who were Yiddish speaking came to South Africa in waves of emigration that began in the late 1800’s .They brought with them their culture, their humour, their way of seeing the world and their community infra-structure. It was in this world that we grew up. But they did not speak of the trauma of the Holocaust which they had escaped. Most Jewish families in South Africa had some family still living in Lithuania on the eve of WW2. Usually that family was never heard from again. Lithuanian Jews, Litvaks, had lived beside their neighbours for hundreds of years. During WW2, almost the entire community was murdered and buried in over 200 mass killing sites scattered throughout the country</p>

<h3>The Installation </h3>
<p>Three Jewish South African artists, Yda Walt, Cheryl Rumbak and Phillip Miller first created the Kaddish installation in 2009 for exhibition in Kaunas, Lithuania. It was a memorial to the murdered Jewish citizens of Kaunas (known by its Jewish inhabitants as Kovno). The intention of the work was to ignite memory and break the amnesiac silence of post war Lithuania.   The exhibition that will be shown in South Africa will include the original Kaddish installation consisting of reproducing pages of a 1939 Lithuanian telephone book giving addresses, professions and telephone numbers of the citizens of Lithuania including all the Jews who subsequently perished. The installation also consisted of an embroidered map of the killing sites of Lithuania. The Kaddish prayer is printed on fabric and the haunting soundscape by Phillip Miller of the Yiddish lullaby Oyfn Propetshik. The artists are making a second installation which looks at the experience of South African Jews of Litvak descent, who grew up during the Apartheid era in South Africa and who have journeyed back to Lithuania in search of ‘der Heim’, their grandparent’s lost world. It is in this installation a work of David Goldblatt’s will be shown of the Popolan forest. The Popolan forest is where the Jews of Popolan, homosexuals, Roma and mentally ill of the town were murdered and buried.</p>

</div></div>","Where is Kovno? 
Where is Kovno?  has been invited to exhibit at the Johannesburg Holocaust and Genocide Centre in April 2017.  Many South African Jews have Lithuanian ancestry and yet do not know much of the details of their Lithuanian heritage. Lithuanian Jews (Litvaks) who were Yiddish speaking came to South Africa in waves of emigration that began in the late 1800’s .They brought with them their culture, their humour, their way of seeing the world and their community infra-structure. It was in this world that we grew up. But they did not speak of the trauma of the Holocaust which they had escaped. Most Jewish families in South Africa had some family still living in Lithuania on the eve of WW2. Usually that family was never heard from again. Lithuanian Jews, Litvaks, had lived beside their neighbours for hundreds of years. During WW2, almost the entire community was murdered and buried in over 200 mass killing sites scattered throughout the country

 

The Installation 
Three Jewish South African artists, Yda Walt, Cheryl Rumbak and Phillip Miller first created the Kaddish installation in 2009 for exhibition in Kaunas, Lithuania. It was a memorial to the murdered Jewish citizens of Kaunas (known by its Jewish inhabitants as Kovno). The intention of the work was to ignite memory and break the amnesiac silence of post war Lithuania.   The exhibition that will be shown in South Africa will include the original Kaddish installation consisting of reproducing pages of a 1939 Lithuanian telephone book giving addresses, professions and telephone numbers of the citizens of Lithuania including all the Jews who subsequently perished. The installation also consisted of an embroidered map of the killing sites of Lithuania. The Kaddish prayer is printed on fabric and the haunting soundscape by Phillip Miller of the Yiddish lullaby Oyfn Propetshik. The artists are making a second installation which looks at the experience of South African Jews of Litvak descent, who grew up during the Apartheid era in South Africa and who have journeyed back to Lithuania in search of ‘der Heim’, their grandparent’s lost world. It is in this installation a work of David Goldblatt’s will be shown of the Popolan forest. The Popolan forest is where the Jews of Popolan, homosexuals, Roma and mentally ill of the town were murdered and buried.

In the Siaudine forest outside Popolan-Papile, Lithuania, where on 22 July 1941, 50 Jews and 5 Lithuanians were shot dead by Nazi soldiers and their local collaborators.

The funding we are trying to raise would go towards: 

Recreating the original Kaddish installation
Implementing a second installation using South African Jewish voices
Editing film footage of survivor testimonies and recording new stories

can barely believe the positive change in their learners.  It's because we do things very differently than most.  This is not summer school, and it's so much more than a summer camp.  HAPPY Reading is answering a decades-old problem that is hurting America.  We help close the achievement gap by giving kids reading skills, confidence, hope, and HAPPINESS in just a few weeks.This is not skill and drill.  This is a joyful exploration of history, science, sports, the arts, community service and so much more---through, with and for the sake of reading.  We lead children to a natural love for books by thinking outside the book.We served 57 children last summer.  And most of them attended for free.  Virtually every child saw MAJOR, measured gains in their ability and attitudes about reading.  This school year, reading and writing has been so much easier for them than ever before!  Help us to make reading HAPPY for even more young learners.  Why this matters...Poverty.  Unemployment.  Crime.  Incarceration.  Racism. Bullying.  Questionable character.  Low self-esteem.  Fractured families. Dysfunctional communities.Name almost any problem that eats away at a cohesive, American fabric.  Think of all the reasons for underachievement and emotional distress.  Research tells us that for a large percentage of what's hurting us, poor reading skill is a common denominator.  Building a brighter future can be as simple as helping more kids become proficient readers...helping more families bond through books....giving more people access to the healing power of simple stories and helping them to unleash the creative genius we all have within.We've started something special...The achievement gap...the cavernous difference between the academic success of white, middle-class America and virtually everyone else.... has remained a persistent problem for decades.  But guess what?  The newest research tells us there's NOT a huge difference in intelligence.  There's a difference in resources...especially in access to books,  intellectual stimulation and enrichment during the summer months.Our camps address this by thinking outside the book and making reading another fun part of summer camp...with outstanding results.This time next year... ...at least 10 kids will be better readers and writers than they are right now.  They will be stronger communicators and much HAPPIER about it...if you will help us.  We know this because of what we've seen with our campers who attended in the first two years!  Some hated reading and now won't put down books!  Others have gone on to win reading awards and writing contests!  And some have said that for the first time in their lives, they feel smart.We want to raise enough money for AT LEAST 10 kids to attend summer reading camp for at least two weeks.  These are kids recommended by their schools for extra help.  These are kids who will be able to attend for FREE because of your generosity.With your help......year 3 of our specialty camps will be even better than last year's.  We're looking for $3,000 to cover camp costs for location, staffing, materials, and camp essentials for 10 campers.  We would love to reach even more by exceeding our goal!  If you will make this investment in our project, we will deliver great results for the good of our campers and the good of our world.

<p>Proyecto Bembe (Project ""Bembe"") is an Afro-Latino percussion-based performing arts after-school program for youth in grades 1-8 on Milwaukee’s South Side where over 90% of the community is of Latino decent. Through the use of applied ethnomusicology techniques within a Positive Youth Development model, Proyecto Bembe will promote musical and performance skills that are structured to supplement schools' academic curriculum in an inclusive environment for children of all abilities, including those with special needs, hyperactivity and ADHD diagnoses. With a unique parental involvement component, Proyecto Bembe also builds youth leadership, assertive communication and collaboration skills, and self-respect and cultural identity exploration through Latino musical culture.</p>

</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>With 70% of our community's student body enrolled in after-school care, high quality after-school activities are critical. With 80% of our students qualifying for free or reduced lunch, often with single parents or 2-parent families working 1 or more jobs each, the high<b> <i>quality</i></b> of Proyecto Bembe arts instruction and the convenient schedule/location for school families make it an exceptional opportunity for arts enrichment.</div>
<div>The impact of Proyecto Bembe will be especially strong within the special needs student body that often struggles in the academic environment, especially those children with hyperactivity, ADHD and distractibility. Hand drumming and dancing release high amounts of physical, mental and creative energy, and connect children to rhythm in ways that calm and provide order. In most cases, these drumming activities highlight the cognitive and physical GIFTS of children with hyperactivity/ADHD - a powerful confidence-builder after a school day of being redirected or asked to calm down.</div>
<p>There is an even greater social impact resulting from this program as well. Milwaukee is America's most racially-segregated city and, based upon the educational gap, incarceration rates and other social factors, in 2013 Milwaukee was sited by multiple sources as statistically the ""worst city in America"" to grow up as a Black child.  Growing up in a ""black or white"" city, there are few opportunities for children of all backgrounds, especially Latino, to form open and positive associations with the African cultural roots of US-American/Latin American/Latino culture - <i>especially the music we all love</i>. Moreover, there are few structured opportunities to explore this in a school-based setting that connects the practicing of the arts to history, foreign language, social studies and art history through <b><i>ethnomusicology.</i></b> </p>

<h3>Why Your Support Now? #ChancetoReset</h3>
<p>We’ve garnered incredible support from government, community partners, individuals, and foundations to open our Bay Area campus. And we have never been more excited about the potential of the organization to transform criminal justice. However, we urgently need to secure funding so that we can access our next round of grants from foundations and government. By providing your support now, we can continue to serve our current cohort of eight students and empower them with the #ChancetoReset. By the end of year, we will enroll ten new students. And you will put us in a position to change the way justice is delivered in America.</p>
<h3>A ""New Day"" for Reset Students</h3>
<p>Over 2.3 million Americans are incarcerated in the US, most for nonviolent offenses. 68% of those who leave prison will be rearrested within three years. The young men we serve have faced systemic barriers to success all throughout their lives—under-resourced schools, daily risks of violence, and limited access to the opportunities young people deserve.</p>
<p>A young man in our program lives and learns at our campus instead of serving time in a dehumanizing prison environment. Students come to us from the courts: promising candidates are accepted into Reset based on a personal application and with a judge’s consent. Students live onsite for a minimum of 1 year, followed by at least 1 year of non-residential transition support. Students in our program:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engage in a personalized, rigorous <strong>EDUCATION</strong>, working towards either a high school diploma or college degree.</li>
<li>Master <strong>PROFESSIONAL SKILLS</strong> through on-site work, skills training, internships and job placement.</li>
<li>Develop a <strong>HEALTHY WELL-BEING</strong> and critical life skills (parenting, violence prevention) through physical &amp; mental health supports, leadership and life skills training.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our residential education program integrates best practices from education, workforce, youth development, health, and justice. By creating an environment where these young men can thrive, we equip our students to break free of the vicious cycle created by institutionalized mass incarceration.</p>
<h3>Meet Darahn</h3>
<p><i>“I see this as a stepping stool, as well as a blessing.”</i></p>
<p>Darahn was facing a 3-5 year prison sentence when he was instead accepted into Reset. He came to us with resolve: to figure out how to build a better life for himself.</p>
<p><i>“My goals for the future are to start working to build my own foundation. I’m trying to start a family, be financially stable, and be more wise—and not let circumstances dictate my behavior.”</i></p>
<p>Over the last 6 months at Reset, Darahn has spent his time studying hard toward his AA degree and coaching little league baseball. He has emerged as a natural leader for new students:</p>
<p><i>“The fact that it’s a new program—we are helping to shape it…I’m becoming even more of a leader from being in the program. I try to lead by example.”</i></p>
<h3><strong>Reset’s Impact</strong></h3>
<p>A first-of-its-kind model, the Bay Area campus is the first in a network that will reimagine the justice system for young adults in the US. We are proving the potential of our model and aim to grow to three more regions in the next five years.</p>
<p>Our current cohort consists of eight young men who are turning their lives around. With your support, we can enroll 45 more students in the next three years.</p>
<p>Reset students leave our program will the skills and mindset to lead healthy, successful lives. Our program significantly reduces students’ risk of recidivism, or getting another conviction. And we aim for these additional student outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>All students demonstrate two years of academic growth for every one year enrolled</li>
<li>All graduates leave with stable housing</li>
<li>All graduates leave with an education or employment option in hand</li>
</ul>
<p>Through our students’ success, Reset will demonstrate an impactful public-private partnership for justice that can then be scaled across California and the US. This will not only result in significant cost savings to government (estimated 7:1 return on investment for each Reset graduate) but will change the way justice is delivered in America.</p>

<h3>What is a MakerSpace?</h3>
<p>Simply put: a Makerspace is a place where students can develop their own interests, be creative, explore new ideas and figure out how to turn those ideas into reality. Next year at the TA Library teen makers will move in to one of our library offices, use the 3-D printer in part of the computer lab, and be able to set up shop using portable kits at any of our tables. In the coming year we are going lay the foundation for a Makerspace that will be responsive to student and teacher interests and needs-- but we need your help.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why TA Library?</h3>
<p>Libraries have always been about providing people with the resources they need to learn. They're also about sharing resources in a way that is efficient and cost-effective to communities. While the shop and art room already provide space for student making, the addition of resources in the library will mean that both students and teachers can easily access tools, materials and support during and after school. We will be building a collection that includes both high-tech and low-tech tools for making things and spans both traditional and cutting edge methods.</p>
<p> </p>
<div><h3>Our Fundraising Goals</h3></div>
<p>With the funds we raise we will be purchasing resources that make it easier to bring hands-on projects into the classroom as well as tools and materials that students can use to pursue personal projects and learn new skills. Here's some of what is on our shopping list:</p>
<ul>
<li>filament for our 3d printer so students can print the designs they create ($250)</li>
<li>electronic components, two soldering irons  and lead-free solder ($175)</li>
<li>a MakeyMakey ($50)</li>
<li>LittleBits Synth Kit ($159) and Smart Home kit ($249)</li>
<li>Adobe Creative Cloud software for graphic design, illustration, audio editing and photo editing to be installed on two computers. ($300/computer each year=$600)<br/><br/>The grand total for everything listed? $1,483. If we fall short of our goal-- or exceed it-- all funds raised will be used to provide materials for students to work with.<br/> </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Our Vision for Student Learning</h3>
<p>We will be kicking off next year with the student-led construction of our new 3-D printer from a kit. This, and other Makerspace projects will be visible to the entire school. It's our goal to foster the spread of excitement about creating throughout the student body by helping students succeed in their projects so that other students see that they can succeed, too. We want our students to be empowered as active creators and makers rather than just passive consumers. We will know we are reaching our goals when students choose to use their free time to learn, tinker and create.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute financially there are still plenty of ways you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the word out and make some noise about this campaign. </li>
<li>Use the share tools to spread news about the TA Library Makerspace online.</li>

He aquí un desglose de los gastos actuales y proyectados:Gastos legales de Establecimiento € 4.000 (Actual)Informática  (ordenadores, impresoras, etc.) € 3.000 (1.400 € actuales)3 meses de sueldos y cargas sociales (1 Senior 2 Jr. 3@5.000) 15.000 € (proyectado)Gastos Operativos 8.000 € (4.000 € actuales)Total: 30.000 € (13.400 actuales)Estos costos se calculan para los tres primeros meses de funcionamiento. Al ver la gran demanda por parte de las partes interesadas, nuestro proyecto debe ser autosuficiente a partir de entoncesSomos la clave en lo que nos permite sefardíes, como decimos en Djudeo Espanyol, ""Aboltar a La Kaza Muestra"" Para volver a nuestro hogar, SEFARAD-ESPAÑA.  Muchas gracias por su apoyo y difusión",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">het ondernemersklimaat is nog nooit zo gunstig geweest. De verwachting is dat het aantal toeristen in 2020 ten opzichte van 2015 vier maal zo groot gaat worden. Dit kan de bezetting van de Lodge enorm vergroten. Zambia kent al jaren een politiek stabiel klimaat. Daarnaast investeert de overheid in toerisme.</span><br/>

<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Tiko moet een bijzonder onderdeel kunnen zijn voor de toerist van een unieke reis in Zambia.</span></li>
<li>de ondernemende studenten die nu van de Tiko Academy af komen, kunnen op dit moment hun kennis niet omzetten in kunde en zullen daarom vertrekken!</li>

Veelgestelde vragen
1.  Bijzondere droom wordt gerealiseerdProbleem: Tiko is OP DIT MOMENT nog afhankelijk van donaties.Tiko heeft vanuit het NIETS heel veel bereikt, MAAR is nog steeds voor 85% afhankelijk van donaties. Een essentieel doel van de Tiko gemeenschap is ondernemerschap stimuleren en inkomsten proberen te werven uit toerisme. Helaas kunnen de eigen leveranciers en het eigen personeel niet geheel betaald worden voor hun diensten en dus is er ook geen inkomen voor de te onderhouden gezinnen. Deze gezinnen hebben minimaal 3,5 euro per dag nodig en dat lukt op dit moment helaas nog niet! Doordat er onvoldoende toegang is tot een betaalbare lening wordt hun droom naar zelfredzaamheid geblokkeerd! Oplossing: een nieuwe Lodge Door verscheidende gebouwen en faciliteiten binnen het Tiko terrein aan te passen, kunnen er meer toeristen en klanten van de lokale bevolking terecht voor een verblijf in de Tiko Lodge. Dit is belangrijke stap om een gemeenschap te creëren die onafhankelijk is van Donaties. Op die manier stimuleert Tiko ondernemerschap…en dat is de weg naar zelfredzaamheid!De zes gebouwen en faciliteiten die aangepast dienen te worden, noemt men te samen: De nieuwe Lodge. De nieuwe Lodge

2.  Hoe kun jij helpen, het verschil te maken?
Op de volgende vier manieren kun je helpen:I.   Door te doneren, zoek deze roze knop rechts boveninVul daarboven je bedrag in en druk op de knop, de rest volgt vanzelf.II.  Door een donatie te doen waar een ""Perk"" tegen over staat,Perks zijn donaties waar iets tegenover staat. Meer details weten? KLIK op de tegenprestaties rechts onder de roze knop!III.  Door je mening achter te laten.        Laat Tiko weten wat jij zou willen bezoeken in Zambia?IV.  Door deze campagne op Facebook, Twitter, Google+ te delen, maak je kans op een Reischeque van 1.000,- euro, vrij te besteden! Zie in de video hieronder hoe: Meerdere combinaties van de vier punten is naar eigen keuze mogelijk!DONATIES ZIJN AFTREKBAAR VOOR NEDERLANDSE DONATEURS (ANBI-STATUS TFN)NB; Als het doneren niet lukt, bekijk dan even de instructievideo's op: http://www.tikondanefoundation.nl 3.   Doelstelling, plan en begrotingDoelstellingHet doel is om binnen 5 jaar de nieuwe Lodge financieel onafhankelijk te laten functioneren als onderneming, door middel van zelfstandig lokaal management. Voor de aanpassingen van de gebouwen en het stimuleren van ondernemerschap door microkredieten is eenmalig €100.000,- nodig. Dit bedrag zal beheerd worden via een lokaal Trust fonds, dat gekoppeld is aan Tiko. De Trust zorgt ervoor dat alleen financieel gezonde initiatieven zullen worden gefinancierd vanuit dit fonds. Op deze manier zal er er een betaalbare geldstroom ontstaan voor en door ondernemers. Plan, Stimuleren van ondernemerschap De te verstrekken leningen vanuit het Trust fonds hebben geen winst oogmerk en hebben een sociaal karakter. Dit houdt in dat Tiko initiatiefnemers goedkoper geld kunnen lenen dan bij de gebruikelijke partijen in Zambia, Dit is noodzakelijk voor stimuleren en ontwikkelen van ondernemerschap.Zodra de Lodge winst boekt, na aftrek van alle kosten, zal deze winst ten goede komen aan het ontwikkelingswerk binnen Tiko.Waarom is juist NU het beste moment om ondernemerschap te stimuleren?

het ondernemersklimaat is nog nooit zo gunstig geweest. De verwachting is dat het aantal toeristen in 2020 ten opzichte van 2015 vier maal zo groot gaat worden. Dit kan de bezetting van de Lodge enorm vergroten. Zambia kent al jaren een politiek stabiel klimaat. Daarnaast investeert de overheid in toerisme.

Tiko moet een bijzonder onderdeel kunnen zijn voor de toerist van een unieke reis in Zambia.
de ondernemende studenten die nu van de Tiko Academy af komen, kunnen op dit moment hun kennis niet omzetten in kunde en zullen daarom vertrekken!
de groei van Tiko is niet houdbaar op basis van donaties en daarom is het NOODZAKELIJK om Tiko onafhankelijk te krijgen.
het gehele project kan nu vijf jaar lang ter plaatse begeleid worden.
De BegrotingDe begroting en het 5 jaren plan zien er op hoofdlijnen als volgt uit:wanneer de nieuwe Lodge gerealiseerd is, zal er bij een jaarlijkse kamer bezetting van 48% een “break even*” punt bereikt worden. *break even = als kosten gelijk zijn aan de batenIndien er jaarlijks een kamerbezetting is van 60%, zal men in staat zijn om zelf investeringen en aflossingen af te handelen. Indien de bezetting boven de 60% stijgt, zal dit ten gunste komen van de Tiko community. Mocht de begroting te krap blijken, dan zal de Lodge minder snel onafhankelijk zijn en daarmee dus ook de Tiko community in zijn algemeen. Het geld wat eventueel over zal blijven, zal worden ingezet voor:1.   aantrekkelijke leningen voor andere Tiko ondernemers2.   investering in scholing, vakonderwijs en armoede bestrijdingsprogramma’s3.   het faciliteren van overnachtingen in de omliggende dorpen.   Meer weten over doelstelling het plan of de begroting die overeengekomen is met Tiko! Lees dan de management samenvatting! van het businessplan.4. De toekomst en ambassadeur Allan Murphy  Wordt Tiko ZELFREDZAAM?Zou het niet geweldig zijn als dit OVER 5 jaar in de kranten staat:“Tiko is een bijzondere gemeenschap in Zambia die in staat is om je de echte Afrikaanse cultuur te laten ervaren zoals je die nergens anders tegenkomt. Ze weten vele reizigers en toeristen te verbazen, zodanig dat ze zich als ware ambassadeurs ontpoppen. Deze gemeenschap is nu 100% ONAFHANKELIJK van donaties! Ze hebben geen hulp van buitenaf meer nodig, ze zijn volledig zelfredzaam! Vijf jaar geleden werd dit mogelijk gemaakt door DEZE CROWDFUNDING CAMPAGNE: het bleek een succesformule!”  ZORG JIJ DAT DIT IN DE KRANT KOMT?STEL dat dit bericht ECHT over vijf jaar in de krant staat. Zou dat niet fantastisch zijn? Willen we dat niet allemaal? ZELF-redzaam zijn in onze eigen leefomgeving? Tiko kan niet zonder jouw hulp. KLIK op de Perks aan de rechterkant om Tiko te helpen. Je krijgt er zelfs wat voor terug! Je kunt zelfs een reis naar Zambia winnen. Verder kun je Tiko ook helpen door je mening achter te laten! Ook dat helpt!Alan Murphy van Lonely Planet over Tiko


De Australische Alan Murphy, coördinerend redacteur van de Lonely Planet (reisgids Zuidelijk Afrika) beschrijft kernachtig en treffend waarom de toerist naar Tiko moet komen: “Wat mij heeft bewogen is de armoede en moeilijke voorwaarden waaronder mensen leven. Tiko verzorgt kritische diensten voor deze arme gemeenschap. Tiko geeft toeristen de kans om met de Zambiaanse bevolking te leren kennen op een manier, die op andere toeristische locaties niet mogelijk is. Bezoekers krijgen een echte glimp van culturele tradities en kunnen deelnemen aan het dagelijks leven van de meest vriendelijk denkbare mensen. Tiko wordt waarschijnlijk nooit een 3-sterren hotel. Maar het is een geweldige springplank voor het verkennen van Zambia en het aangaan van ontmoetingen met de lokale gemeenschap. De Nederlandse Tiko Foundation investeert met de actie in de zelfredzaamheid van Tiko en ik beveel deze campagne van harte bij je aan om hun poging -voor het verbeteren van de accommodaties- te ondersteunen. ""Please give generously. I know I will.”November 2015, Alan MurphyDit verhaal omschrijft perfect wat Tiko te bieden heeft en dit is uniek in Zambia!5. SponsoringWanneer organisaties aan dit project doneren, zullen zij daar zelf ook baat bij hebben omdat zij er sponsoring voor terugkrijgen. Zorg dus dat jouw Logo hier ook komt te staan! Dan profiteer je al tijdens deze crowdfunding campagene van de aandacht! We verwachten meer dan 40.000 mensen met deze crowdfunding campagne te bereiken. Zie voor meer informatie; Perk 7.

1


16 jaar geleden is Elke Kroeger-Radcliffe vanuit het
  niets gestart met het bestrijden van analfabetisme voor volwassenen en kreeg
  twee hectare grond toegewezen.




2


Tiko heeft in 16 jaar meer dan 12.000 mensen, waaronder weeskinderen en analfabeten geholpen aan voedsel en verbeterde gezondheid en ontwikkeling. 




3


Tiko ontsluit (basis/vak) onderwijs voor degene die
  hier geen toegang toe hebben (er bestaat geen leerplicht in
  Zambia).Tiko faciliteert:
  -   een peuterspeelzaal.
  -   basisonderwijs voor ruim 450 kinderen (wees)kinderen), 
  -   vakonderwijs (denk aan: timmerwerkplaats, rietvlechterij, weverij,
  naaiatelier, productie plantaardige olie, administratie, ect.)
  -  sinds kort ook de Tiko Academy (voortgezet onderwijs) met de nadruk
  op betere landbouw technieken. 
Verder is er ook een ‘Interns' programma, waarbij jonge
  mensen met een middelbare school diploma -maar met geen hoop op voortgezet
  onderwijs- werken in de verschillende Tiko afdelingen en proberen
  tegelijkertijd hun kansen op de arbeidsmarkt te verbeteren.




4


Tiko bestrijdt met een zeer effectief programma de armoede in
  de omliggende dorpen. In 26 dorpen werkt men met het programma “19
  steps out of poverty”. Door middel van dit programma wordt geprobeerd de zelfredzaamheid van de
  plaatselijke bevolking te stimuleren.




5


De gezondheidszorg in de omgeving verbetert door een
  gezondheidsadviseur van Tiko.




6


Tiko is een veilig thuis voor inmiddels 85 werkzame
  mensen.




7


Elke Kroeger-Radcliffe wil dat de plaatselijke bevolking op termijn
  zelfstandig bestuur moet kunnen voeren. Hierbij is het van belang dat men ook
  financieel loskomt van fondsen en sponsoring, zodat onafhankelijk bestuur daadwerkelijk mogelijk is.




8


Zambia kent al jaren een politiek stabiel klimaat. De
  overheid investeert in toerisme.




9


Er zijn meerdere kleine boeren die duurzaam voedsel
  verbouwen en toeleveren




10


In de lokale taal betekent Tiko ‘lief zijn voor
  elkaar’. De gasten beleven niet alleen een Lodge, maar ervaren nauwe
  contacten met de lokale bevolking.




11


De verwachting is dat het aantal toeristen in 2020 ten
  opzichte van 2015 verviervoudigd, dit kan de bezetting van de Lodge
  enorm vergroten.

8. Veel gestelde vragen
1. Zijn de donaties aftrekbaar van de belasting? Sinds 1 januari 2008,  wordt  Tikondane Community Support Foundation, of Stichting Tiko door de Nederlandse Belastingdienst gekenmerkt als een Algemeen Nut Beogende Instelling. Dit ANBI nummer is: 8197.65.235 Dit geeft bij opgave van de belasting recht op aftrek.2. Ik heb geen Pay-pal of creditkaart, maar ik wil wel doneren, is dat mogelijk?Ja dat is mogelijk, je kunt je donatie overmaken naar het bankrekeningnummer van de stichting Tiko. Geef in de omschrijving aan van welk Perk nummer je gebruik wilt maken en wij zorgen dat het in de campagne komt. Het rekening nummer is: NL71 ABNA O5136944043. Is €50.000 jullie doel? Nee dit is NIET ons doel, we gaan voor de € 100.000 natuurlijk.We willen zelfredzaamheid in de komende 5 jaar stimuleren. De nieuwe Lodge is begroot op €88.000,-. Indien de renovatie binnen de begroting blijft kan de rest gebruikt kan worden voor de microkredieten om ondernemerschap te stimuleren. Dan is er een grotere kans dat Tiko financieel zelfredzaam wordt. 4. Houden jullie ons op de hoogte?Ja, iedereen die doneert of een ieder die wenst op de hoogte gehouden te worden krijg maandelijks een nieuwsbrief!5. Is de verzending van bijvoorbeeld de DVD inclusief verzendkosten in de Perk?Nee niet bij alle. Het staat apart vermeld.6. Hoeveel geld gaat er uiteindelijk van het bedrag naar het trustfonds?Het is nog niet helemaal zeker hoeveel dit precies zal zijn. De crowdfundings kosten zullen verrekent worden met het uiteindelijk verworven bedrag en alles wat daarna overblijft gaat naar het trustfonds.  7. Het doneren lukt niet

8. Wat als het doelbedrag niet wordt behaald?

For Danielle, expressing herself, overcoming her conflicts and growing seemed impossible to do on her own, especially without a vehicle that could drive her feelings towards healing and productivity.  But then, Project Rhythm came to her school for the first time. She was able to take part in a Project Rhythm program, where she collaboratively wrote, recorded, produced and performed songs. She was empowered to express herself, learn about the collaborative and creative process, stay out of trouble, and overcome the loss of her friend. She graduated from high school and gained the confidence and skills she needed to secure a job. Danielle continues her involvement in Project Rhythm programs and she continues to writes songs and grow through music.  She said to us, ""Thank you for this opportunity, I got a job and I'm happy for myself.""</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p></p><h3></h3><h4><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><h1>Youth + Song Creation = Goodness</h1>

We deploy music education programs to learning environments, which help students learn technical & collaboration skills.Ultimately, Project Rhythm believes these outcomes will empower youth to make constructive choices and to become beneficial contributors in society.We're raising $30,000 to continue operations and grow in 2016. The funds go towards supplying equipment and training teachers for schools in New York City.Your generous donations combined with our incredible team of volunteers allows us to serve more youth that would otherwise be without music based education. Learn more at http://projectrhythm.orgSTORY - MEET DANIELLEToday, Project Rhythm has served thousands of students like Danielle, inspiring them to collaborate, create and develop life skills through music.In 2009, Danielle J. was roaming the halls of Public School #753 in Brooklyn NY, instead of attending class.  She felt lost and could not face the idea of sitting in a classroom after tragically losing her best friend to an unfair death at a young age.  Government budget cuts made music-the medium which is by far the most influential in her life-virtually non-existent. For Danielle, expressing herself, overcoming her conflicts and growing seemed impossible to do on her own, especially without a vehicle that could drive her feelings towards healing and productivity.  But then, Project Rhythm came to her school for the first time. She was able to take part in a Project Rhythm program, where she collaboratively wrote, recorded, produced and performed songs. She was empowered to express herself, learn about the collaborative and creative process, stay out of trouble, and overcome the loss of her friend. She graduated from high school and gained the confidence and skills she needed to secure a job. Danielle continues her involvement in Project Rhythm programs and she continues to writes songs and grow through music.  She said to us, ""Thank you for this opportunity, I got a job and I'm happy for myself.""Youth + Song Creation = Goodness
Through our programs, young people build valuable personal and professional skills like collaboration, conflict resolution, computer skills, engineering skills, performance, public speaking, and product creation. And all while they have fun doing it!

As a lifelong resident of Erie, PA, I have consistently been drawn to global travel and non-profit work. I am currently serving as a full-time volunteer through the AmeriCorps VISTA program at the Quality of Life Learning Center. Starting July 6th, I will begin a 6 month fellowship in Bangalore as part of the IDEX Global Fellowship. Please support me as I embark on my next journey to India  and share this wonderful experience with me. All funds raised from this campaign will be used to offset the cost of flight and living expenses in India. Any funds raised in excess of my goal will be used to support the Wings Learning Center.About the Fellowship:Each year, the IDEX Global Fellows Program invites a select number of individuals to take part in six-months of leadership training across India. Fellows gain emerging market experience while working hands on with socially-focused enterprises who deliver high impact solutions in local and global communities.A social enterprise can be thought of in a variety of ways, but is generally considered a business with a social mission. This means that its mission is to generate profit while also tackling social problems and improving people’s lives. My Placement: I will be placed with Wing’s Learning Center. Wing’s is a social enterprise focused on providing quality education to underserved children in rural areas within India.  They offer affordable private learning centers to low-income elementary school children. Wing's operates in an after-school setting and offers academic and soft-skills training to youth, with a special focus on technology.Why this Site is Perfect for Me: This fellowship will give me the opportunity to gain hard business skills in business management, business plan development, and marketing/operations, while also allowing me to pursue my interests in education and community development.  I will be based in the main offices in Bangalore, but will travel extensively to the rural centers and work one-on-one with youth and teachers. Testimonials:Please watch the following video to see what my kids have to say about me! How You Can Help: While volunteering as an AmeriCorps VISTA has been invaluable experience for me, it is financially challenging for me to afford the additional expenses incurred by this trip. By giving any monetary amount to my campaign, you will help send a qualified individual with 2 years of non-profit experience to work in a global context.

We're absolutely thrilled to have been invited by Shofco to conduct photography training workshops for the students of the <strong><a href=""https://www.shofco.org/approach/girls-leadership-and-education/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kibera School for Girls</a></strong>, which features a journalism program, perfect for the curriculum provided in our workshops. Shofco is doing an incredible job with their education programs-- their academic test scores for 2020 were above the national average. We are so excited to be able to put cameras in the hands of these bright, future leaders, and give them the tools and skills for artistic and documentary expression. The photography, digital arts and media training for students are designed to add an important component to Shofco's <a href=""https://www.shofco.org/approach/girls-leadership-and-education/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Girls Leadership and Education program</strong></a>. The two-week-long workshops are designed to give the girls an empowering platform for visual and artistic expression, while teaching them vocational skills in photojournalism image making and editing.</p>

<p>As a longtime educator (eight years in K-12 classrooms and 17 at the university level), and a <a href=""http://www.oneofusproject.com/biography"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>widely published and exhibited artist and photojournalist</strong></a>, I've spent the latter part of my career flipping the script by putting cameras in the hands of those I might have found myself photographing in the past. I'm a strong believer in the cathartic, therapeutic, and empowering qualities of art making. Most recently, I worked with a group of people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles on a photography workshop similar to the one we are planning here, and the results were as moving for me as they were for the participants of <a href=""http://www.oneofusproject.com/photography-workshops"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>How We See It</strong></a>. This Shofco project is so close to my heart, as I spent eight years living and working in Kenya early in my career, with much of that time spent in places like Kibera, where I worked closely with street children and those selfless social workers and other service providers.</p>
<h3><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></h3>
<p>Kibera is the largest slum in Nairobi, and the largest urban slum in Africa. Sources suggest the total Kibera population may be 500,000 to well over 1,000,000 depending on which slums are included in defining Kibera. Most of Kibera’s residents live in extreme poverty, earning less than $1.00 per day. Unemployment rates are high. Persons living with HIV in the slum are many, as are AIDS cases.  Cases of assault and rape are common. There are few schools, and most people cannot afford education for their children. Clean water is scarce. Diseases caused by poor hygiene are prevalent. A great majority lack access to basic services, including electricity, running water, and medical care. </p>
<p><strong>THERE'S MORE...</strong><br/>A second workshop will be conducted for the <a href=""https://www.shofco.org/approach/ghetto-mirror/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>SHOFCO Urban network’s SUN Magazine</strong></a>, with an emphasis on photojournalism skills and techniques. This is being planned along with a  photography exhibition and academic/media panel discussion at the United States International University in Nairobi, and in partnership with another Kenyan NGO, <a href=""https://actionchildren.or.ke/about-us/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Action for Children in Conflict</strong></a>, to bring attention to the plight of street children. Selections from the SHOFCO workshops will be showcased in our exhibition. <strong>Kenya Airways</strong> has also signed on as a sponsor, providing generous logistical support for the project.</p>
<p>Learn more about the workshops and our talented team of activists and media specialists who represent the <a href=""http://www.oneofusproject.com/kenya-2020"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>One of Us Project in Kenya</strong></a>. To learn more about David Blumenkrantz, please visit his <a href=""http://www.oneofusproject.com/biography"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>bio page</strong></a>. </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><i><strong>To make this opportunity a reality for the girls in Kibera, we have budgetary and material needs that total $15,000. Primarily, we are seeking either the financial or material donations to provide our workshops with:</strong></i></p>
<p>Nikon Coolpix or Canon Powershot cameras, 25 @ $100 each<br/>SD cards for the cameras, 25 @ $11 each<br/>Accessories such as cases, batteries, 25 sets @$20 each<br/>Portable PC  laptops for Kibera Girls School, 2 @ $700 each<br/>Adobe Creative Suite licensing to install photo editing software, $600<br/>Printing and framing costs, $1000<br/>Stipends to compensate Kenyan support staff, $1000<br/>Miscellaneous expenses including t-shirts, meals/refreshments for participants, $500</p>
<p><strong>PERKS</strong><br/>For contributions between $50-$99 you will receive a 100% cotton One of Us: Art for People t-shirt, available in S, M and L.</p>
<p>For contributions of $100 and up, you will receive a signed copy of <strong><a href=""http://www.oneofusproject.com/edges-of-africa-book-synopsis"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Edges of Africa</a></strong>, a hardcover anthology of photographs and writing by David Blumenkrantz, featuring more than 200 color and black &amp; white images taken during eight years of living and working in East and Central Africa. David's work, which features striking and intimate environmental portraits, has been published and exhibited in several countries around the world. A significant portion of the book is dedicated to coverage of street children and urban poverty in Kibera and elsewhere. Mercy Gichengi, a member of the One of Us Project team in Kenya is a former street girl herself. In <strong><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeEpQtMmNWU"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">this video</a></strong>, Mercy speaks eloquently about her own experience of rising above her childhood poverty, which she wrote about in Edges of Africa.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges: The Covid Factor</h3>
<p>These workshops were originally planned for 2020, but we've had to postpone them due to the Covid-19 pandemic. We're working closely with the educators at Shofco to monitor the situation; while Kenyan schools have experienced intermittent shutdowns, we are now confident that the schools will be open and functioning for our workshops.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you can't afford to make a contribution to this effort, you can still play a part by sharing this campaign on all of your social media platforms. Every little bit helps! Thank you...</p>

We're absolutely thrilled to have been invited by Shofco to conduct photography training workshops for the students of the Kibera School for Girls, which features a journalism program, perfect for the curriculum provided in our workshops. Shofco is doing an incredible job with their education programs-- their academic test scores for 2020 were above the national average. We are so excited to be able to put cameras in the hands of these bright, future leaders, and give them the tools and skills for artistic and documentary expression. The photography, digital arts and media training for students are designed to add an important component to Shofco's Girls Leadership and Education program. The two-week-long workshops are designed to give the girls an empowering platform for visual and artistic expression, while teaching them vocational skills in photojournalism image making and editing.

As a longtime educator (eight years in K-12 classrooms and 17 at the university level), and a widely published and exhibited artist and photojournalist, I've spent the latter part of my career flipping the script by putting cameras in the hands of those I might have found myself photographing in the past. I'm a strong believer in the cathartic, therapeutic, and empowering qualities of art making. Most recently, I worked with a group of people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles on a photography workshop similar to the one we are planning here, and the results were as moving for me as they were for the participants of How We See It. This Shofco project is so close to my heart, as I spent eight years living and working in Kenya early in my career, with much of that time spent in places like Kibera, where I worked closely with street children and those selfless social workers and other service providers.
THE IMPACT
Kibera is the largest slum in Nairobi, and the largest urban slum in Africa. Sources suggest the total Kibera population may be 500,000 to well over 1,000,000 depending on which slums are included in defining Kibera. Most of Kibera’s residents live in extreme poverty, earning less than $1.00 per day. Unemployment rates are high. Persons living with HIV in the slum are many, as are AIDS cases.  Cases of assault and rape are common. There are few schools, and most people cannot afford education for their children. Clean water is scarce. Diseases caused by poor hygiene are prevalent. A great majority lack access to basic services, including electricity, running water, and medical care. 
THERE'S MORE...A second workshop will be conducted for the SHOFCO Urban network’s SUN Magazine, with an emphasis on photojournalism skills and techniques. This is being planned along with a  photography exhibition and academic/media panel discussion at the United States International University in Nairobi, and in partnership with another Kenyan NGO, Action for Children in Conflict, to bring attention to the plight of street children. Selections from the SHOFCO workshops will be showcased in our exhibition. Kenya Airways has also signed on as a sponsor, providing generous logistical support for the project.
Learn more about the workshops and our talented team of activists and media specialists who represent the One of Us Project in Kenya. To learn more about David Blumenkrantz, please visit his bio page.

David's work, which features striking and intimate environmental portraits, has been published and exhibited in several countries around the world. A significant portion of the book is dedicated to coverage of street children and urban poverty in Kibera and elsewhere. Mercy Gichengi, a member of the One of Us Project team in Kenya is a former street girl herself. In this video, Mercy speaks eloquently about her own experience of rising above her childhood poverty, which she wrote about in Edges of Africa.


 
 
Risks & Challenges: The Covid Factor
These workshops were originally planned for 2020, but we've had to postpone them due to the Covid-19 pandemic. We're working closely with the educators at Shofco to monitor the situation; while Kenyan schools have experienced intermittent shutdowns, we are now confident that the schools will be open and functioning for our workshops.

It's customizable. It was built by teachers for teachers. Check out what we've built so far below or visit our site: CommentsLab.io 



 

Comments Lab allows educators to create and edit standardized feedback templates. Whether a teacher needs to provide guidance on a progress report or give a weekly update to parents about social growth, each template can be manipulated to fit the occasion.  With consistent, constructive feedback, students are much more likely to realize their growth potential. This tool is fast, easy to use, and already catching on in schools around the world. 
 
With the structure of education evolving, allowing teachers to communicate directly with students effectively, regardless of location, is more important than ever. 
 

 
The Idea
My name is Felix. I'm a math teacher. 

A colleague and I realized that traditional grades, like  B+  or  78%, do little to help our students grow. Kids need specific feedback to help them learn. Unfortunately, educators lack the time to regularly provide this type of guidance, which leads to a lot of ""copy and paste"" or ""universal"" comments generated for entire classes.

to help you learn about  
our incredible past, present, and future. 
  EARTH in action with the AstroReality app.


 A trip around the globeHow much do we know about the impressive planet we all live in? Now, you can take an epic trip around the globe through space and time with our EARTH model and corresponding app.

 

 
EARTH is the first-ever augmented reality-enabled globe that lets you see our planet’s changes across history.  
Just open the app and point your phone’s camera at the model for a deeply immersive learning experience. 

The app displays information on several in-depth categories: 

 
Ever wondered how many gallons of water are in the ocean? 
With EARTH you can track geology, to study the formation and evolution of our physical planet.
Curious about what animals inhabited your country 1,000 years ago? 
With EARTH you can track the migration and habitats of animals past and present.
And much more!


 
EARTH's technology takes you through time to explore our planet’s rich geographic history,
along with the current state of our world due to climate change, natural disasters, and more.

 
The deeply-layered, interactive experience covers basic geographic information such as landmarks, latitude and longitude, time zones, and regions.

 
The app also displays complex visualization across various topics such as heat maps, cloud atlases, point maps, texture maps, and more.
 
Control EARTH with your voice
While you explore the globe with your hands, use our smart voice technology—named  GAEA, powered by Microsoft LUIS - to direct the app and discover a wealth of information about the earth.
Here are a couple questions you can ask Gaea across the various categories. Just say ""Hey GAEA!"" 
and ask away...


 

 
Gaea is here to help with your journey across time and space.

 
Gaea displays the information you want, right before your eyes.
  Or, get Gaea to navigate you around the app!

We then finish with a hand painted layer on every single unit.

The Preparatory Dance Program of the University of North Carolina School of the Arts is the preeminent dance education program in our area.

Upon completion of our program, our students will have achieved the tools needed in preparation to audition for the UNCSA high school dance department and the discipline they need to continue onto a healthy life, no matter what path they choose. <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> </span><span style=""font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span><p style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><i><br/></i></span></p>

The issue is I'm low on funds and need to pay off tuition, flights, visas and accommodation so I am safely set up and ready to go. Stella Adler is one of Constantin Stanislavski's (the grandfather of modern acting) direct pupils from the United States, and whilst she passed away back in 1992, just a year after I was born, her legacy carries on through her academy. For her, acting wasn't just about performing, it was about living passionately, imaginatively and knowing your worth, and this is the way I want to be as an artist and professional actor: so I can give back to the community through my best asset. Coming from a lower socio-economic background and single parent family, education has always been triumphed as a noble under-taking but the funding of such tasks has never been easy. This is why I need your help, this I why I need you!</p> </div> <div> <h3>Why Help Fund Me?</h3> <p>The question you may be asking is why should you contribute to this cause for me? Well, aside from giving me the opportunity to study at my dream school, which I have been wanting to study at for years now, is that it will allow me to have the edge I need back home to work in this competitive industry, be taken seriously, and acquire an agent that can help me get work. It will also teach me the skills I need to be truthful, convincing and immersed in the characters I play to help tell the stories of the world, for how can we act upon issues if we are not aware or emotionally connected to the stories that find the common humanity between us and others?</p>
<p>I've broken the costs down, and am working to raise $5,000 to aide my trip:</p>
<p>- $3,650, for tuition costs</p>

</div></div>","Stella Adler? My name is Kyle Kash and I'm a 23 year old actor from Perth, Western Australia and I have been accepted into the prestigious acting academy of Stella Adler's Studio of Acting in New York City, for their summer program. The issue is I'm low on funds and need to pay off tuition, flights, visas and accommodation so I am safely set up and ready to go. Stella Adler is one of Constantin Stanislavski's (the grandfather of modern acting) direct pupils from the United States, and whilst she passed away back in 1992, just a year after I was born, her legacy carries on through her academy. For her, acting wasn't just about performing, it was about living passionately, imaginatively and knowing your worth, and this is the way I want to be as an artist and professional actor: so I can give back to the community through my best asset. Coming from a lower socio-economic background and single parent family, education has always been triumphed as a noble under-taking but the funding of such tasks has never been easy. This is why I need your help, this I why I need you!   Why Help Fund Me? The question you may be asking is why should you contribute to this cause for me? Well, aside from giving me the opportunity to study at my dream school, which I have been wanting to study at for years now, is that it will allow me to have the edge I need back home to work in this competitive industry, be taken seriously, and acquire an agent that can help me get work. It will also teach me the skills I need to be truthful, convincing and immersed in the characters I play to help tell the stories of the world, for how can we act upon issues if we are not aware or emotionally connected to the stories that find the common humanity between us and others?
I've broken the costs down, and am working to raise $5,000 to aide my trip:
- $3,650, for tuition costs
- $1,000 accommodation costs
- $1,472 for flights to and from Perth and New York (not including insurance)
Now, this alone does exceed what I'm asking from you guys, but to be able to pay even some of this off would help me achieve my dreams without going severely into debt and not being able to use the skills I learn from this prestigious school when I return home. Even if I don't reach my target, being able to pay off the majority of these fees would help ease the burden of financial stress that would make this task even more daunting. My main focus is to absorb as much as I can from this course while in New York City and push myself beyond any measure I have gone before to be the best I can be and give this world my talents so I can make it a better place.

worker-owned cooperatives; develop relationships between cooperatives, labor
institutions, and resource organizations; and build the movement for workplace
democracy.  </p>
<p>It is fundamental that the knowledge, resources and contacts of this conference be available to all those who can benefit from workplace democracy. We are asking you to help make our incredible conference <b>ACCESSIBLE </b>to low-income people, parents, and non-English
speakers with your donation to support scholarships, childcare and interpretation.  All donations up to $100 will be
matched 1-1 by a generous donation from the <a href=""mailto:http://f4dc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Fund

What's The Issue?


The Harsh Reality:

Students who end up in careers where they are not feeling engaged and fulfilled are costing billions to the economy. 






Here’s Where WOW Talks Comes In…

WOW Talks for Schools aims to change the status-quo by awakening the passion in young people, helping them find their own unique talent, inspiring them to dream and giving them the confidence and tools to follow their own career ambitions. At this very crucial juncture in their lives, there is nothing more important than showing them that with hard work, perseverance and commitment, they can achieve whatever their heart desires.
Through our unique and interactive platform, which features role models (who not so long ago were in the students' exact seats) sharing their real life experiences and personal journeys with students, WOW Talks for Schools opens a necessary dialogue between young people and graduates. This format helps create a mindset that anything is possible!






What exactly is 'WOW Talks'?

 WOW Talks is a social impact organisation that delivers engaging live events and online video content to inspire people to reconnect with their WHY – their purpose- so they can attain greater fulfillment in their professional lives. 

How Does the Format Work?


The WOW Talks platform delivers relevant and inspiring content via both live events and an interactive online channel (www.wowtalks.tv). Each 90-minute event is run like a TV show and made up of 5 x 9-minute talks given by speakers from different industries, cultures and disciplines who are committed to creating a life doing what they love most and who share their personal stories... their Words of Wisdom (WOW).
One of the speakers is always a performer– a musician, dancer, comedian, etc. – who delivers up to 3 performances during the evening, making the event not only inspiring, enriching & insightful but also entertaining! 





See What Students & Teachers are Saying About Us:





Why Are We Here?


We need your help in raising funds to build a platform that will enable us to establish our footprint in the UK school system.  We need to raise £30,000 to enable us to bring the WOW Talks experience to the students of 10 schools in disadvantaged areas. 
By contributing to our campaign, you will be giving students the opportunity to hear first-hand that it IS possible to make a living doing what you love, and helping to provide the students with the courage and motivation needed to follow their own dreams. In essence, by sponsoring one student to experience a WOW Talks event, you could actually make a huge impact on that student's future.  Pretty great feeling, isn't it?!



How Will the Funds be Used?

It costs £3,000 to bring the live WOW Talks experience to one school. This amount covers the cost of speaker selection and coaching, management of the event on the day, professional filming and editing of the talks and development, 
All funds raised through this campaign will be put towards bringing the WOW Talks experience to secondary school students*.





*Based on the assumption that an average of 300 students will attend a WOW Talks for Schools event at any one school. We may also bring the live WOW Talks experience to students at another school in their community or through a dedicated WOW Talks for Schools festival.




The Proof is in the Pudding (as they say…)



WOW Talks isn't just an off-the-cuff idea that was thought up overnight. In fact, we have been running WOW Talks events in the real world for the past 5 years, which has given us plenty of time to test and evolve the format until we came up with a product that was truly insightful, inspiring, entertaining...and powerful!

To date we have held 45 WOW Talks events in various locations around the globe including London, New York, Berlin and Tel Aviv. The events have been held in galleries, museums, cinemas, Google Campuses and Apple stores. Our events have featured close to 250 speakers and were attended by over 6,000 people, all of whom are part of our growing global WOW Talks community. WOW Talks has a proven model – it just works!

It is non-profit body which is the cultural and economic heartbeat of its community. As well as exceptional live performances, the Stirling Festival Theatre also provides many services to the surrounding community such as youth programs, and summer camps. It is especially proud of its work developing theatre skills with young people. Its Young Company, a group of teenagers from Stirling and the surrounding area, receive professional training in all the skills associated with the Theatre - acting, singing, dancing, etc. This enables them to put on three or four shows a year, notably a summer Broadway musical, which runs for three weeks and draws in audiences from all over the area.</p>
<p>During the summer months  the hall upstairs becomes extremely hot and uncomfortable. Among its uses, perhaps the most important is as a rehearsal area for the Young Company.  To make the hall more comfortable, both for the kids and for the other uses of the hall the Stirling Festival Theatre would like to install a new air conditioner. You can help us afford it.</p> <p><span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; background-color: initial;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span><br/></p>
</div><div> <p>The Stirling Festival Theatre needs $15,000 to purchase and install a new air conditioning system for their upstairs hall and rehearsal area. </p> <ul> <li>As a theatre many of our perks will provide access to great live entertainment performances.</li> <li>Our shows include:  Live Concerts, Christmas Pantomime, Plays and the Young Company performance of ""Legally Blonde"".</li>
<li>All perks can be claimed through the Stirling Festival Theatre Box Office (Address: 41 W Front St, Stirling, ON, Tel:  1-877-312-1162)</li>

driver for the township of Stirling-Rawdon.  Stirling is a distinctly
rural community at the geographic heart of the region’s farming country and is
located approximately half-way between Peterborough and Ottawa.  The
audience who attend the Stirling Festival Theatre annually is drawn primarily
from the Bay of Quinte region, Hastings, <span>Prince Edward and Northumberland Counties.
 Under the leadership of Managing Director, David Vanderlip,
 Stirling Festival Theatre presents over 100 performances each year. In
addition to presenting a year-round roster of outstanding touring shows, SFT
also produces a shows including at least two original Canadian plays each
year.   Over the last  decade, more than $500,000 worth of
renovations have been made at the theatre, including air conditioning of the
main auditorium, new washrooms, a complete overhaul of the box office, new
seating and sound baffling in the auditorium, excavation of the orchestra pit,
and re-wiring of the complex. Shows are presented to a paying audience
primarily in the main auditorium.  Music, cabarets, and dinner theatre style
Murder Mysteries are  presented in Eugene Burrell Hall, a cabaret space

nurturing the next generation of emerging artists.  There is a strong and
active ‘Young Company’, whose productions  feature up-and-coming local
performers. </span></p>
<p>SFT is proud of the continual growth in our artistic and
theatrical endeavours, but mostly we are delighted to say that over 45,000
people come to Stirling every year to attend small town theatre with big
time talent!</p>
<br/><p></p><p></p></div>","Short Summary The Stirling Festival Theatre was built in 1927. It is non-profit body which is the cultural and economic heartbeat of its community. As well as exceptional live performances, the Stirling Festival Theatre also provides many services to the surrounding community such as youth programs, and summer camps. It is especially proud of its work developing theatre skills with young people. Its Young Company, a group of teenagers from Stirling and the surrounding area, receive professional training in all the skills associated with the Theatre - acting, singing, dancing, etc. This enables them to put on three or four shows a year, notably a summer Broadway musical, which runs for three weeks and draws in audiences from all over the area.
During the summer months  the hall upstairs becomes extremely hot and uncomfortable. Among its uses, perhaps the most important is as a rehearsal area for the Young Company.  To make the hall more comfortable, both for the kids and for the other uses of the hall the Stirling Festival Theatre would like to install a new air conditioner. You can help us afford it. What We Need & What You Get
 The Stirling Festival Theatre needs $15,000 to purchase and install a new air conditioning system for their upstairs hall and rehearsal area.   As a theatre many of our perks will provide access to great live entertainment performances. Our shows include:  Live Concerts, Christmas Pantomime, Plays and the Young Company performance of ""Legally Blonde"".
All perks can be claimed through the Stirling Festival Theatre Box Office (Address: 41 W Front St, Stirling, ON, Tel:  1-877-312-1162)
We know with continued hard work, dedication and YOUR help we can realize our financial goal to see this project to completion.
