<h3>Summary</h3>On September 6th, all of my photography equipment was stolen while I was attending a local festival in Landstuhl, Germany. My hope is that once I retire from the military, that I could do photography as a secondary career. Currently, photography is just a big hobby for me that I enjoy doing for myself and for my friends. Fortunately, most of my equipment is covered under my insurance policy; however, $750 of it is not covered because I did not have enough coverage for items that actually went up in value (significantly).<br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What I Need<br/>
</h3>

<p></p></span></span></div>","SummaryOn September 6th, all of my photography equipment was stolen while I was attending a local festival in Landstuhl, Germany. My hope is that once I retire from the military, that I could do photography as a secondary career. Currently, photography is just a big hobby for me that I enjoy doing for myself and for my friends. Fortunately, most of my equipment is covered under my insurance policy; however, $750 of it is not covered because I did not have enough coverage for items that actually went up in value (significantly).

What I Need

$750 to cover my losses from my theft. The original equipment cost for my gear is around $12,000. $250 of the $750 is for the deductible and the other $500 is for the cost that isn't being covered by my insurance company.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

I purchased and used every accessory that was designed to help reduce the problem above, but none could provide a complete solution. All of them decreased shadows, but also decreased key light as well, losing the “brilliance” of the picture.

The wavy surface pattern of the WAKELITE 3D increases the reflection of light from the flash by up to 20 percent, distributing light to all directions, bathing the surroundings in brilliant glimmer, shining light to the subject and eliminating shadows.

WAKELITE 3D with its silver lining provides excellent illumination even for the couples dancing in the background, up to the highest motions.During my works, if I had to use flash, I was always disturbed by the flattened, shady outcome. I purchased and used every accessory that was designed to help reduce the problem above, but none could provide a complete solution. All of them decreased shadows, but also decreased key light as well, losing the “brilliance” of the picture. Their questionable results were only applicable with a low ceiling, only up to 3-. 5meters. My drive towards excellence led me to the development of WAKELITE 3D a?er more than 10 years of trial.3D printing technology allowed me to develop the final iteration of a prototype, resulting in the invention of the WAKELITE 3D flash attachment. The wavy surface pattern of the WAKELITE 3D increases the reflection of light from the flash by up to 20 percent, distributing light to all directions, bathing the surroundings in brilliant glimmer, shining light to the subject and eliminating shadows. Key light remains, light loss is negligible. Portraits and object photos are sculptural, colors are bright. The range of the device is 20-30 meters, taking full potential of the capabilities of the flash. The main idea behind the invention is, not to hold back light, but use the flash in a ways to keep the key light, and fill in shadows. Using two or three flashes and a bit of experimenting can easily result in a picture without shadows, close to natural lighting even in a spacious enclosure. “We can keep a studio lighting in our pocket on a bargain, which is not even connected to a power line.” Can be kept in a small photo bag, or even in your pockets.The installation of WAKELITE 3D takes only a single motion. The strap can be kept on the flash (even in a photo bag).The reflecting insert has a shiny silver finish by default, but 3 options are available for purchase (white, gold and silver) to match the composition.WAKELITE 3D is compatible with almost all available flashes with its elastic strap. The product is ready for mass production. Istvan Budai, Photographer, Inventor Silver-White-Gold-Grey How to use the reflecting insertsThousands of pictures shot during the years prove that using WAKELITE3D we can shot exceptionally good pictures. By experiments we managed to perfect flash photography with various inserts.By exchanging inserts we can shoot wide variety of shadowless, sculptural pictures. By rotating the flash head we can discover new dimensions in creative photography. It’s an extraordinary experience creating new pictures by experimenting with reflected, diffused light. It fills in the background beautifully, still key light remains. Only in rear cases is it necessary to use multiple flashes. When we encounter spatious rooms, halls we can use 2-3 flashes. in this case we can use white as key light, silver as background, grey as filler to shoot beautiful pictures. Note: In the image below you can see, that when we arrived to Szidónia Hotel the londiner asked if he could help us carry in the lots of stuff, because a former photographer had huge amounts of equipment. TIMELINECURRENT STATUSThe product is ready for Mass Production!",27.0,0,"1 Campaign

Advanced professional-level high definition video capabilities (that includes a host of industry-standard recording protocols and enhanced performance) make it possible to capture beautiful cinematic movies in EOS HD quality. A newly designed 22.3 Megapixel full-frame Canon CMOS sensor, Canon DIGIC 5+ Image Processor, and shooting performance up to 6.0 fps provide exceptional clarity and sharpness, even when capturing rapidly-unfolding scenes.

<p>The 24-105 L is one of my favorite general purpose lenses, but it also works well for portraits.

</div>","I've been working as an assistant and second shooter to a wonderfully talented photographer for over 4 years.  Now its time for me to strike out on my own but I'm gonna need a bit of help to get my business off the ground.  I currently own a Canon T1i and a 50mm prime lens.  This camera is not a professional grade DSLR however and cannot be used in a professional manner.                                                                  Camera Bodies*I plan to purchase a Canon 5D Mark 2 ($1800 for the body only) or 3 ($3400 for the body only).Canon is proud to present the highly anticipated EOS 5D Mark III. With supercharged EOS performance and stunning full frame, high-resolution image capture, the EOS 5D Mark III is designed to perform. Special optical technologies like the 61-Point High Density Reticular AF and an extended ISO range of 100-25600 (expandable to 50 (L), 51200 (H1) and 102400 (H2) make the EOS 5D Mark III ideal for shooting weddings in the studio or out in the field, and great for still photography. Advanced professional-level high definition video capabilities (that includes a host of industry-standard recording protocols and enhanced performance) make it possible to capture beautiful cinematic movies in EOS HD quality. A newly designed 22.3 Megapixel full-frame Canon CMOS sensor, Canon DIGIC 5+ Image Processor, and shooting performance up to 6.0 fps provide exceptional clarity and sharpness, even when capturing rapidly-unfolding scenes. Additional technological advancements include an Intelligent Viewfinder, Canon's advanced iFCL metering system, High Dynamic Range (HDR), and Multiple Exposure mode - all of which that help make the EOS 5D Mark III the perfect multimedia tool.

Luna is a 360° camera designed for everyone. Handy, and with a single-button operation, Luna makes shooting in 360° as easy as taking photos with your phone.
Using a dual 190° fish-eye lens technology, Luna has no moving parts, allowing it to be small and sturdy. Waterproof, with gyro-stabilization, and a host of accessories, Luna is a perfect companion for your adventures, memories, and creativity.
In built wi-fi allows you to interactively preview 360° footage on your smartphone, immediately and wirelessly save it on your devices, share it on social media, and even live-stream moments in 360°. With Luna Cardboard and Luna’s mobile app, you can even view your videos in immersive virtual reality.
No camera rigs. No stitching. No cables. 360° video at the click of a button.


360° VIDEO Shot with Luna
360° videos are an exciting new medium. By letting the viewer decide where to look, 360° videos create an interactive, immersive environment.
Today, to shoot high quality 360° video, one needs expensive, bulky camera rigs and complicated stitching software. We’ve built Luna to make 360° video accessible to everyone.

( 360 video is currently supported on Chrome and on the YouTube mobile app. )




SEAMLESS




We’ve designed Luna from the ground up to fit seamlessly into your life. Just 6 cm in diameter, and weighing just over 180g, Luna can be best compared to a pool ball. This not only makes Luna easy to carry, but allows for effortless operation.
One click for panoramic 360° photographs. 
Two clicks for stunning full HD 360° videos. 
It’s that simple.


Luna is able to achieve this extraordinary size, due to its dual 2K, 190° fish-eye lens technology. Supported by advanced auto stitching, Luna is able to seamlessly combine images to create crisp, full 360° panoramic photos and video.

STURDY



No matter how hard you try, 2-dimensional photographs do not do justice to the magnitude of your adventures.  It is impossible to capture the enormity of the snow clad mountain range, the adrenaline fueled rush of a skydive, or even the breakneck pace of your jet ski. Luna enables you to really share these moments, allowing your friends and family to truly experience your adventures.

Luna’s magnetic adaptor allows Luna to not only stick to any magnetic surface, but also interface with a docking station, a monopod, a keychain, and a universal accessory adaptor.

360 footage is recorded and streamed in 2K (1920×960) resolution, but the quality and frame-rate of spherical / flattened videos when viewed differs depending on the type of display, display magnification and network signals.
Luna’s is designed to be IP68 waterproof. However, the waterproof level of the final product may be different according to multiple factors including battery heat, housing design, and WiFi signal etc.
According to our practical tests with the latest prototype, the current battery life is 31mins of continuous operation. However, the real battery life may be different according to the context and environment, and may also be constrained by the final product design.
We are confident that given our strong partnerships and robust R&D, we will be able to deliver Luna on time, as promised. In case of inevitable manufacturing delays, we will ensue that you are kept updated and well informed.",22.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>Hi my name is Brandi Von Black. I'm a self-taught full time photographer of 4 and 1/2 years in Oklahoma and around the country. My favorite styles are alternative, edgy, fashion, portrait and pinup.</p>
<p>Recently my brand new laptop, photography equipment (even backup drives) were stolen and put my business in chaos. As of right now most of the work i do is reshoots (for free) refunds (paying back for shoots that were lost) and even small claims. Therefore, affording new items is very difficult right now. I've been working on a very old laptop that gives me the blue screen of death all the time, eats pictures, and none of the usb plugs work so i must edit hi res images using the touchpad and cannot back anything up. This fund will help me get everything back on track so i spend less time struggling with equipment and more time catching up and shooting!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The goal is $2000 dollars to cover the cost of a new laptop, new tablet, external hardrive, memory cards and a light</p>

</h1><p> We  are a small design and manufacturing company called Globalscale Technologies and we have created and certified a great new camera. We are headquartered in Anaheim that have been involved in a lot of open source software and development hardware since 2009 with open source development kits like the Sheevaplug and Smileplug. This has enabled a lot of creation in the developer, hacker, wireless, and networking space.</p><p>We actually took one of our original development designs and morphed it to create the GTcam which is a wired and wireless IP camera which uses the Skype protocol as the application to view the camera.You can view this camera using Skype on your smartphone, tablet and desktop computer. </p><p>You may have seen a similar project on indiegogo and other crowdfunding sites but we are the first and (as far as I know of) the only company  to be issued the formal license from Skype to build a standalone ip camera using their software and via there servers. Many people have certified product such as webcams and cameras for smart TVs. As such we are allowed to use the 'plugged into Skype' classification for certified embedded devices.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/182767/files/20131107134151-plugged_into_skype.jpg?1383860511"" src="""" style=""width: 192.23px; height: 91px;""/> </p><p>This was a long development and testing project that took over a year and a half of many engineers and people not just from our company but with partners as well. nonetheless we have obtained the license key so rest assured when you get this camera it is approved and ready to go! That is why we are confident we can ship product. After all this hard work we want to share the benefits and to improve the product with added features and into the retail space.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/195259/files/20131113103505-PCBA.jpg?1384367705"" src="""" style=""width: 427.66px; height: 321px;""/></p><h1>What is next?</h1><p>We are seeking to raise a minimum of $2,000 for this project. First and foremost this will be used to build and distribute the cameras. While the design for the original is complete we used an off the shelf tooling for the first design We want to improve this design and add LED night vision and an external speaker and this will cost money for tooling and actual hardware. We will also need to re-certify the product with FCC and CE certification to ship in many countries. The purpose of this campaign is not only to fund improvements for the next generation GTcam but also to validate the design and market for this product.</p><p>_________________________________________________________________________________</p><h1>Perks!</h1><p>For the <strong>first perk</strong> you will receive this camera for a $99 Donation.

However note are a US company and we cannot ship products to countries where  foreign trade has been banned or restricted for various reasons.</p><p>Also because of legal complications unrelated to us, <b>we cannot sell this product directly into China (People's Republic of China)</b>. The GTcam works in China but US firms are prevented from selling this and similar products into the market.</p><p><strong>Question 3:</strong>  What are the shipping costs?</p><p>Answer 3: Shipping in the continental US (not including Hawaii &amp; Alaska) is included to help ease shipping logistics. It will be via FedEx, USPS or UPS and oversees it will vary according to country. Canada will be need to add $12 and international will be $30.There are some countries where shipping runs a high risk of being randomly getting stuck in customs (for example Turkey and Russia).

<p></p></div>","Introducing GTCAM GTcam is a simple to setup and use IP camera for monitoring your baby, pets, family, home, and small office. It has ethernet and WiFi and it is certified to use Skype as the interfacing software via smartphone, tablet, and laptop/desktop. In fact you can use it anywhere you can use Skype!FeaturesEthernet or WiFi- Connect your camera via Ethernet cable or with WiFi to your home or office routerRecording via SD card slot-up to 4 days on a single card!Microphone and Audio (optional external speaker)-hear what your baby or pets are saying and even talk back to them!USB port (for optional LED nightlight and future Zigbee/Zwave Automation controller)Access anywhere Skype runs (Android, IOS, Windows, Blackberry)Easy setup-No Fussy CDs or DNS setup, 3 step setup process from a laptop or desktop for the first time. See video below for setup guide.__________________________________________________________________________________Why Skype?Why did we decide to work with Skype instead of developing our own native mobile applications?1) Skype is free to use with broad cross platform support across a wide range of devices and platforms includingWindows, IOS, Android, Blackberry, Linux, basically anywhere you can run Skype you can use this camera!This also means we can access Skype/Microsoft's servers. Most IP cameras need to pay cloud storage and fees and if they don't pay or go under then the camera fails. Here even if Globalscale were to somehow cease to exist your camera would still work. Also our savings lets us pile savings back to consumers.2) Skype is secure. A lot of IP cameras have been hacked recently putting peoples privacy at risk. Skype's hybrid peer to peer network is one of the most advanced and secure systems and we wanted to leverage that in our product. We have also added features requiring the owner to authorize any friends that want to use the camera in a very secure manner.3) Skype can get around firewalls. a lot of very good IP cameras are blocked by even the most basic firewalls or have problems operating in the office environment. Skype is one of the best at getting around firewalls. Anywhere you can use Skype you can use the GTcam!An estimated 400 million people have Skype accounts and know how easy it is to use__________________________________________________________________________________How can you use this camera               
Elderly CamOffice/Warehouse CamBaby/Nanny CamPetcamClassroom Cam__________________________________________________________________________________Who we are and how did we get here 
 We  are a small design and manufacturing company called Globalscale Technologies and we have created and certified a great new camera. We are headquartered in Anaheim that have been involved in a lot of open source software and development hardware since 2009 with open source development kits like the Sheevaplug and Smileplug. This has enabled a lot of creation in the developer, hacker, wireless, and networking space.We actually took one of our original development designs and morphed it to create the GTcam which is a wired and wireless IP camera which uses the Skype protocol as the application to view the camera.You can view this camera using Skype on your smartphone, tablet and desktop computer. You may have seen a similar project on indiegogo and other crowdfunding sites but we are the first and (as far as I know of) the only company  to be issued the formal license from Skype to build a standalone ip camera using their software and via there servers. Many people have certified product such as webcams and cameras for smart TVs. As such we are allowed to use the 'plugged into Skype' classification for certified embedded devices. This was a long development and testing project that took over a year and a half of many engineers and people not just from our company but with partners as well. nonetheless we have obtained the license key so rest assured when you get this camera it is approved and ready to go! That is why we are confident we can ship product. After all this hard work we want to share the benefits and to improve the product with added features and into the retail space.What is next?We are seeking to raise a minimum of $2,000 for this project. First and foremost this will be used to build and distribute the cameras. While the design for the original is complete we used an off the shelf tooling for the first design We want to improve this design and add LED night vision and an external speaker and this will cost money for tooling and actual hardware. We will also need to re-certify the product with FCC and CE certification to ship in many countries. The purpose of this campaign is not only to fund improvements for the next generation GTcam but also to validate the design and market for this product._________________________________________________________________________________Perks!For the first perk you will receive this camera for a $99 Donation. It has WiFi, Ethernet, MicroSD slot, mic, and a 3.5mm audiojack. This camera will MSRP for $129 very shortly so you this is a great value for early adoptersSince the camera design is complete we are confident we will ship the existing model housing. If we do not reach our goal we will still ship cameras for the people who opt for this.For the 2nd thru 5th perk we are going to sell essentially the same camera but with a new enclosure and with microSD card onboard for data recording. Here is the CNC/3D mockup with which we will build tooling for. We have added an additional USB for external night vision LED and we will add a custom designed speaker for the audio jack so you can not only talk into it but talk back through the camera. The USB port will enable either LED lighting or an optional zwave/zigbee home automation dongle in the near future.__________________________________________________________________________________RisksWe know that hardware projects have risks as we have worked with hundreds of startups and companies since our inception. Alot of new companies underestimate the costs of building tooling, certifying hardware, and costs of shipping logistics. We ourselves have learned many lessons along the way but have gained the experience and capabilities to deliver the goods. We continually ship hardware everyday for our developers and customers and will treat you with the professionalism and service that people have come to expect and deserve. You can see our company and products we make here.www.globalscaletechnologies.com  There are videos of other startups and inventors whom we have helped to grow. (under case studies)__________________________________________________________________________________FAQQuestion 1: Are there any monthly fees I need to pay to use the GTcam?Answer 1: No, GTcam is free to access and useQuestion 2: Who can buy the GTcam, where do you ship to?Answer 2: Anyone can buy and use the GTcam. However note are a US company and we cannot ship products to countries where  foreign trade has been banned or restricted for various reasons.Also because of legal complications unrelated to us, we cannot sell this product directly into China (People's Republic of China). The GTcam works in China but US firms are prevented from selling this and similar products into the market.Question 3:  What are the shipping costs?Answer 3: Shipping in the continental US (not including Hawaii & Alaska) is included to help ease shipping logistics. It will be via FedEx, USPS or UPS and oversees it will vary according to country. Canada will be need to add $12 and international will be $30.There are some countries where shipping runs a high risk of being randomly getting stuck in customs (for example Turkey and Russia). These will ship at there own risk. Question 4: There was a similar product on Indiegogo earlier. What is going on?Answer 4: Our GTcam was developed with Skype's Skypekit SDK and with technical partners from leading semiconductor firms. We were not the only firm to attempt to make this product but we were the first to be certified by Skype and gain 'Plugged into Skype' certification. What does this mean? it means that our camera passed a rigorous video and audio testing standard and we are authorized to ship consumer goods which access and utilize Skype's software and servers. Previously, developers trying to make this product were granted 60 day development licenses that would have to be renewed.

<h2>
<br/>Mass Production Approval!</h2>
<p>After having built a batch of production quality PlexiDrones, DreamQii focused on refining the manufacturing process to support increased production rates and reduced cost, all without compromising quality. Getting a product ready for high volume production required attention to small details that would otherwise have major impacts on the end product, our customers, and our business.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>Ready for High Volume Production</h2>
<p>Preparing components for high volume production required several stages of review and approval processed which began with an internal review of Design For Manufacturing (DFM) compliance. Key measures in part of this design assurance helped to eliminate issues before having invested in production tooling.</p>

<h2>Cutting Metal</h2>
<p>Cutting metal is the point of no return in manufacturing.</p>
<p>If you’re going to cut metal, you had better be confident that the design is right! Each tool is good for 100,000 parts, so you’d better be happy with the results! Our team spent hundreds of hours qualifying prototype components and developing design standards before investing in this stage.</p>

<h2>Qualifying Parts at 600 FPS</h2>
<p>Qualifying parts that are critical to flight safety is important to our customers and our business performance. This also means we got to break things in super slow motion. PlexiDrone’s battery plastics had to be qualified for safe transport in addition to safe flight. Yes, this means we had to drop batteries from every probable orientation and adjust designs until we believed they went just beyond our performance requirements.<br/> </p>

<h2>Packaging &amp; Shipping</h2>
<p>It is incredible how far the PlexiDrone development and production journey has taken us.  No matter how much progress is made, we (our dev team and our backers) have new challenges to overcome.  Most recently, our focus has been on product delivery, shipping, certification, and testing. <br/> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491787236/qqpkjzzrinacmfvak2qs.jpg"" src=""""/><br/> </p>
<h3>PlexiDrone Product Packaging</h3>
<p>Our team takes great pride in the quality &amp; attention to detail for every aspect of the PlexiDrone product-line.  Part of delivering to our backers means that product packaging design must be ready to go and pass shipping requirements (things can get shaky in transit).  Not only that, but our packaging is a representation of our brand, and must extend itself to the retail environment.<br/> </p>

</div></div>","PlexiDrone Begins Shipping Program
As of May 2018, DreamQii Inc. has begun the delivery perks that backers contributed towards during the PlexiDrone campaign.  The final step in preparing for these initial deliveries involved the design of limited edition Backer Exclusive packaging and navigating the very complex world of international shipments.


 
PlexiDrone Review & Support Videos
Below are the latest PlexiDrone Review and PlexiDrone customer support videos released on our DreamQii YouTube channels. Remember to Subscribe to our channels so you don't miss out on the next set of video tutorials!


Mass Production Approval!
After having built a batch of production quality PlexiDrones, DreamQii focused on refining the manufacturing process to support increased production rates and reduced cost, all without compromising quality. Getting a product ready for high volume production required attention to small details that would otherwise have major impacts on the end product, our customers, and our business.
Read more...

 
 
Ready for High Volume Production
Preparing components for high volume production required several stages of review and approval processed which began with an internal review of Design For Manufacturing (DFM) compliance. Key measures in part of this design assurance helped to eliminate issues before having invested in production tooling.

Click here for a sample tooling design review.

 
Cutting Metal
Cutting metal is the point of no return in manufacturing.
If you’re going to cut metal, you had better be confident that the design is right! Each tool is good for 100,000 parts, so you’d better be happy with the results! Our team spent hundreds of hours qualifying prototype components and developing design standards before investing in this stage.
Read more...



 
Approving Production Samples
Every plastic component had to be inspected for imperfections in order to calibrate the injection mold process for mass production. This stage was as rigorous as the staged prior.
Read more...



 
Qualifying Parts at 600 FPS
Qualifying parts that are critical to flight safety is important to our customers and our business performance. This also means we got to break things in super slow motion. PlexiDrone’s battery plastics had to be qualified for safe transport in addition to safe flight. Yes, this means we had to drop batteries from every probable orientation and adjust designs until we believed they went just beyond our performance requirements. 


 

Bonus: Click here for a sample cycle testing compliance summary of PlexiDrone’s detachable arm plastics. That sounds exciting! 

 
 

First Backers Meet PlexiDrone X8!
Some of our earliest backers have already met PlexiDrone for the first time!  We'd like to thank Terry and Jacob for taking the time to meet with one of our lead designers (Gabriel Otrin) to un-box and play with the PlexiDrone X8, PlexiHub CS, and the PlexiPack HS backpack in person! 
 

 
Be ready to get up and flying when you meet your PlexiDrone for first time by subscribing to  Gabriel's YouTube channel. There you'll get an up-close look at your PlexiDrone with detailed explanations of its market leading features.
 
Packaging & Shipping
It is incredible how far the PlexiDrone development and production journey has taken us.  No matter how much progress is made, we (our dev team and our backers) have new challenges to overcome.  Most recently, our focus has been on product delivery, shipping, certification, and testing.  
 
PlexiDrone Product Packaging
Our team takes great pride in the quality & attention to detail for every aspect of the PlexiDrone product-line.  Part of delivering to our backers means that product packaging design must be ready to go and pass shipping requirements (things can get shaky in transit).  Not only that, but our packaging is a representation of our brand, and must extend itself to the retail environment. 

visit | dreamqii.com for more details on our product packaging   
PlexiDrone Shipping Timeline
As stated in our last update, we are preparing to begin initial deliveries in June 2017. Based on our production and media schedule, we expect that all backer orders will be fulfilled within 60 to 90 days after delivery begins.  The challenges in shipping to over 97 countries are great, but our logistics team is working out  the details with our shipping gateways to reduce costs as much as possible with our new volumes (which are much higher than at end of original campaign).

We've built and run 3 crowdfunding campaigns on Indiegogo - We know what
 we're doing.  Our original campaign in 2013 launched the iSmartAlarm 
brand, and raised over 450% of our goal (and was the 7th highest 
technology campaign of all time at the time).  In 2014 we returned with 
the iCamera KEEP, and we succeeded in providing free cloud video storage
 and pan-tilt motorized controls to a market that was missing it.<br/><br/>
<p>iSmartAlarm products have won national and 
international awards including the CEA Mark of Excellence, Red Dot 
Product Design Award, and PC Mag’s Editor’s Choice Awards. The 
iSmartAlarm Home Security System was featured in Coldwell Banker’s “25 
Smart Home Technologies that Matter Most to Home Buyers.”  iSmartAlarm 
products are sold nationally and internationally in Best Buy, Amazon, 
Staples, Apple Stores online, and many more locations.</p>

</div></div>","Visit our website to learn more about Spot and purchase.Now available in 2 and 4-Packs!Meet Spot, from iSmartAlarm




PC Mag
 - ""This good-looking system is a snap to install, performs flawlessly, 
and has lots of room for expansion, which is a good thing since the 
folks at iSmartAlarm have all sorts of cool upgrades in the 
works."" 

CNET -
 ""Truly a game changer.  Consumers who have long felt priced out of home
 security finally have a legitimate and affordable alternative.""
Security Gem - ""The system is beautiful and well designed and the pieces are discreet and complete.  I think I'm in love!""




Well, hello there!Note: Spot does not move on it's own.  You 
can adjust the base up, down, left, right, and you can make Spot sit, 
stand, squat, or mount Spot on a wall. 


Spot is a smart home camera, but WAY more than that.  Easy to use, packed with 
capabilities, and affordable.  Spot is your watchdog, your ears, your
 intercom, your link to your home, and your new family member.  


Flexible and versatile (and fun!)
Spot includes all of the features and options you need in a small, awesome package - Night vision,
 HD resolution streaming video, motion detection, audio detection, zoom,
 local video storage (up to 32 GB Micro SD) AND free cloud video 
storage, and 2-way audio.  

Spot introduces some amazing NEW features as well - Sound Recognition (with the ability to identify and notify of carbon monoxide and smoke alarm sirens), Time Lapse custom videos, and a simple setup (with audio walkthrough) in less than 3 minutes. With the magnetic mounting plate for wall mounting and twistable, turnable, expandable legs, Spot can capture any angle.

Spot’s patent-pending sound recognition algorithm will keep you 
informed of specific emergencies!  You don’t need to buy a new expensive
 smart home CO monitor or smoke alarm for every room in your house – 
Spot does all the work for you. 
Here's how it works:
When
 your smoke alarm or carbon monoxide (CO) monitor are triggered, Spot 
will recognize the sounds they make and send you notifications telling 
you EXACTLY what the problem is (and which Spot is reporting the 
emergency). 
In the future, we want to add additional sound 
recognition capabilities, such as glass breaking, a baby’s cry, and 
giraffe mating calls.



Time Lapse is an amazing new feature introduced with Spot.  Capture 
an hour, a day, or a week’s worth of pictures and capture a lifetime in 
only a few minutes.  
Here’s how it works: 

In the free app, schedule the start time and end time of your Time Lapse video 
Choose how often you want Spot to snap a picture 
Go!

Our
 CEO Raymond Meng's orchids bloom over multiple days (you can see the 
light change in the video) while he's hard at work - But he can watch 
them any time he wants with Spot's Time Lapse!Shot Duration: 2 days, 13 hours, 58 minutes and 54 seconds1 picture per minute

An entire day's worth of sun, clouds, and activity

You can capture a whole week’s worth of sunrises and sunsets.  You can watch a 
plant grow and blossom (or die, I suppose).  You can see exactly what 
your cat or dog (or fish or lizard or any other animal) do all day.   
Best of all, you can share your amazing Time Lapse videos easily with 
your friends on Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and more.
And YES, the videos above and below are of REAL Time Lapse custom videos shot by Spots!

Can you Spot the thief?
Shot Duration: 8 hours, 34 minutes and 14 seconds
1 picture per minute

 
Listen to what is going on in your home, listen to each room 
individually, and talk to whomever you want - Whether it is passing a 
message to your wife or husband, telling the puppy to get off the couch,
 or telling a burglar that you are watching and recording.  2-Way Audio 
works perfectly as security, awareness, and a walkie-talkie all in one!  

The night is dark and full of terrors.  Don’t be scared - Spot lights
 up the night.   With magical powers (and high strength LEDs), you can 
watch and record activity in even the lowest light.

Watch your home from anywhere at any time with the free iSmartAlarm iPhone 
and Android apps (all you need to set up the app is your phone number).  HD streaming video lets you see what’s going on 
immediately. 


Spot offers free cloud video storage so you can automatically record 
and view events in case Spot is triggered by activity, sound and more.  
Spot also has a MicroSD slot and can store up to 32 GB of video locally 
(MicroSD card not included)

<p>Hi my name is Wesley Righetti I am a student at the Art Institute of California-San Francisco. Im majoring in Digital Filmmaking and Video Production. My project is about a young man who boards a train to visit his sister in the hospital after surviving a severe car accident. Along the way he experiences repressed memories and alternate realities. It is an experimental piece that focuses on the emotions of the main character as he goes through these repressed memories. This project is very important to me because it will be a showcasing of my cinematography skills that I've gained in the last two years. With your help we will be able to fund this project to pay our cast and crew as well as all the post production and distribution.</p>

<h3>What We Need.</h3>
<p>I've been working on this project for the past four months. I have poured my heart and soul into this project but it can only go so far. With your help, I will be able to pay my actors, my crew, my make up artists, as well as funding the post-production and distribution of my film to get it out there for everyone to see. Your help will go a long way to guaranteeing this film gets made. In return for your donations, we have a couple of great perks that involve things like DVD copies of the film, to private party invitations, to an Executive Producer credit on the film.</p>

</div></div>","Forget all camera remotes you knew before. It is time for MIOPS MOBILE, the most versatile wireless camera remote ever! It combines the capabilities of your smartphone with your camera.    MIOPS MOBILE is an exciting solution for DSLR or mirrorless camera owners looking to take amazing photos with the power of smartphone. MIOPS MOBILE connects to the shutter release port of your camera and communicates with your smartphone over Bluetooth. 

The MIOPS MOBILE app utilizes the smartphone's capabilities to offer creative trigger modes like Vibration, Sound, Motion and Distance or even various Timelapse modes to fire your camera remotely. It also provides basic shutter release modes like Press&Hold, Press&Lock, Timed Release, Self Timer and HDR. But the most extra ordinary feature is what we call ""Scenario"" mode which combines any of the available trigger options to create magic. Moreover, you can schedule your desired mode or sequence to fire at any time while you step back and enjoy your life.

 A few seconds of your time could make the difference in growing our community. We need your support to spread the word!

You know that I had my dream of getting a full-frame DSLR fulfilled last May. You probably also know that last November, the mirror fell out and I had to have it fixed, luckily for free.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What you may not know is that all DSLRs have a lifespan of shutter clicks. The lifespan of my 5D is said to be 100,000. Last November Canon told me I was at 67,000. I then calculated that I take 10,000 photos every four months. Twelve months later, I am probably nearing that 100,000 mark and the death of my camera. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>I could send it to Canon and have the shutter replaced for $250 or so. But it's a six year old camera that's been updated twice. The technology has improved so much, particularly in the department of low-light sensitivity. Low-light sensitivity is so so key to my concert photography. So I figure it makes far more sense to upgrade. And I'd like to do so while my current camera is still working. Additionally, for a while now I've been wishing that photos could capture the sound of the music - and then reminding myself that such a thing as video exists. With the 5D mark II, I could capture sound with image! Start shooting video at shows! Make music videos!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The clincher: photography is my job. My parents are generous and pay for school and housing, but drew the line at paying for my cameras. All four DSLRs that I have had over the past five years I bought with money I somehow scratched up. Fun fact: the first (in 2008) was a 2001 Canon D30 that now goes for a whole $66 on KEH.com.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In comes this fundraiser. In essence, it just streamlines what I've been doing anyway: selling prints and taking photos of people and bands. I'm trying to get a lightly used Canon 5D mark II and a couple batteries. Not a mark III, no fancy L lenses (but if perhaps I raise enough...!) I've already saved up some money, so my goal is the deficit.</p>

So I figure it makes far more sense to upgrade. And I'd like to do so while my current camera is still working. Additionally, for a while now I've been wishing that photos could capture the sound of the music - and then reminding myself that such a thing as video exists. With the 5D mark II, I could capture sound with image! Start shooting video at shows! Make music videos!
 
The clincher: photography is my job. My parents are generous and pay for school and housing, but drew the line at paying for my cameras. All four DSLRs that I have had over the past five years I bought with money I somehow scratched up. Fun fact: the first (in 2008) was a 2001 Canon D30 that now goes for a whole $66 on KEH.com.
 
In comes this fundraiser. In essence, it just streamlines what I've been doing anyway: selling prints and taking photos of people and bands. I'm trying to get a lightly used Canon 5D mark II and a couple batteries. Not a mark III, no fancy L lenses (but if perhaps I raise enough...!) I've already saved up some money, so my goal is the deficit.

My hope is to document the way of life of different tribes and how such way of life is being affected by tourism and cultural assimilation through photographic images. I would like to be an advocate for sustainable development and eco-travel efforts in SAPA.  You can read more about this project <a href=""http://haihophotos.wordpress.com/2012/08/15/my-version-of-the-afghan-girl-project/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> and see my photos of <a href=""http://haihophotos.zenfolio.com/p687128658"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SAPA here</a>.</p>
<p>As I have out grown my old limited functionality camera, I sold it a year ago.  I am in the process of fund raising for a new camera system.  I hope you can help me accomplish this by hiring me for your next photography needs, purchasing my photos online or directly donate through my PayPal Account [hai_ho@hotmail.com].</p>
<p>Here are some of the ways that you can assist me as an individual or organization. You can purchase an advanced voucher and in return I’ll do that portrait session, cover a wedding or your organization’s future events. These vouchers/photos also make great gifts: Birthday, Anniversary, Christmas, etc… You can donate by purchasing a one on one point-and-shoot camera lesson session in which we will go over basic photography techniques and how to make the best out of your camera.

How it works
While you shoot, images are automatically transmitted from the camera to your MAC or mobile device (iPhone, iPad, Android,etc). The full resolution images are instantly displayed on a much bigger screen, helping you or your clients see the real images,  reducing expensive time consuming re-shoots. You can shoot from the camera itself, or remotely from the app.iPad App images show below, MAC version works the same way.

Change Camera settings wirelessly from the app

Wireless Motorized Panning and TiltingUsing your own low cost Bescor MP-101 or MP-360 motorized pan/tilt head, plus our accessory cable, you can wirelessly pan and tilt your DSLR camera remotely while still seeing a live wireless view of your cameras viewfinder, and having full wireless control of your camera. No more running back and forth to change where your camera is pointing, just do it remotely from your easy chair wirelessly using the app.Combine panning and tilting with scripts and intervalometer to take great panoramic, HDR, and time-lapse photos. Control pan/tilt speeds along with variable acceleration and deceleration for smooth motion.Here is a quick demo of Pan/Tilt in action:Time Lapse with Pan and TiltCombine motorized pan and tilt with scripting to create time lapse videos.High Speed TriggeringThe XtremeTether accessory cable with a built in micro-processor, also has built in high speed triggering capability. You can trigger using sound, light, motion, laser, or use your own custom triggering device. There are 4 independent channels so you can have 4 trigger sensor inputs, that can trigger a combination of four flashes or cameras at the same time. Programmable trigger delays, auto re-arm, pre-arm, selectable signal trigger edge, trigger levels, and high or low output polarity for each channel.Low cost Arduino Sound Sensor

Above video shows high-speed photography using a simple arduino sound sensor. The sound from the clapping, balloon popping, or glass breaking is detected by the sound sensor and XtremeTether Accessory Cable, triggering the flash, taking the picture.Scripting using BASIC
XtremeTether's BASIC programming language with added extensions for photography and camera control, allows you to develop your own scripts to control the camera. Scripts can be shared with other photographers. Scripts allow you to take pictures, read any camera settings into a script variable, make decisions on that variable, pan and tilt the camera, create your own intervalometer, or your own version of time lapse, read light intensity, check for motion in the view finder, start or stop movie recordings, ramp or change any camera setting, and lots more. The scripts run on the hardware itself, so you don’t have to tie up  your iPhone, iPad or computer while you run long scripts.
Built in Scripts are included for time lapse, HDR photography, and time lapse with panning and tilting. You can add as many of you own scripts as you want, or share scripts with other photographers so they can join in the fun too!
Scripting gives you almost limitless extensibility because you can add new features just by adding your own scripts or pasting one from a friend or from the internet.

<p>Following the stellar success of the Pictar Smart Selfie Stick, Pictar (formerly Miggo) presents the Pictar Smart-Light Selfie Stick – The next generation of selfie sticks, hacking <span>the perfect selfie trifecta: </span>Light, angle &amp; control. </p>
<p>With a detachable light allowing for better selfies under any light condition, the Pictar Smart-Light selfie stick’s 6-button control panel gives you full control of all photographic elements, including zoom, image brightness and more.</p>

<p><span>Lighting is everything.</span> Unbalanced shadows in the wrong places (i.e. under your eyes or nose) can make you look kinda meh. Even lighting will accentuate your best assets and smooth out skin damages. When you’re taking a selfie, make sure you have a good source of light in front of you (unless you’re going for a more dramatic look – in this case light coming from the side will give you a deep, contrast-y feel), or simply pop on your selfie stick’s headlight for consistent lighting that will make you look just awesome.</p>
<div data-id=""27874924""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1585671940/bgeipj241sfdabkaxwij.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>

<p><span>We believe everyone is perfect and beautiful in their own way.</span> None of us have symmetric features or flawless skin... and that’s ok! But when we want to look good in a picture, when we need to present ourselves in a positive way – we need to find our best, most flattering angle. That much can be a tricky thing to do when taking a selfie, when your hand has to keep reaching for your phone to adjust it. That’s why we installed a tilt function into this selfie stick, so that you’ll be able to modify your phone’s angle and find your best look at the touch of a button. It’s just super easy. Try it.</p>
<div data-id=""27874925""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1585671942/axiwqxpun5lzcvsromji.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>

<p><span>The thing about selfies is that you don’t want to look like you’re trying too hard.</span> The best way to achieve that? Just don’t try too hard! This selfie stick’s control panel, located at the base of the stick, surrounded by a rubber coat for maximum stability, gives you full control of all photographic elements, right at the tip of your fingers. Adjust zoom, light, tilt and more using the stick's control panel, so that one arm is always free to do whatever you want, and your overall pose is loose, dynamic and unassuming.</p>

<p>After the launch of the Pictar <a href=""https://www.pictarworld.com/pages/shop"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">mobile photography hub</a> in 2019, we realized that one of the main things people are looking to do with their mobile photography is... taking selfies! We know selfies are big, that’s why we created the 1st generation of the Pictar Smart Selfie Stick, but were surprised to see it day in day out on our best sellers list. </p>
<p>We then took a deep dive into Instagram, studied thousands of selfies, trying to figure out what is it that makes a good selfie and what are most people doing wrong. We realized that finding the right angle and achieving stability and control are key, but the secret sauce that’s missing from so many selfies is good lighting. </p>
<div data-id=""27982008""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1585671982/u6shjteka48zrdkrmvm8.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>Our product manager and lighting expert Sean immediately set out to build the team to design the perfect light this selfie stick – one that’s strong enough, adjustable enough and light to fit a selfie stick, without big or too heavy. After testing numerous options and designs, our team was able to develop and prototype the Pictar Smart-Light Selfie Stick, the ultimate stick for consistently perfect selfies!</p>

</div></div>","Following the stellar success of the Pictar Smart Selfie Stick, Pictar (formerly Miggo) presents the Pictar Smart-Light Selfie Stick – The next generation of selfie sticks, hacking the perfect selfie trifecta: Light, angle & control. 
With a detachable light allowing for better selfies under any light condition, the Pictar Smart-Light selfie stick’s 6-button control panel gives you full control of all photographic elements, including zoom, image brightness and more.





 

Lighting is everything. Unbalanced shadows in the wrong places (i.e. under your eyes or nose) can make you look kinda meh. Even lighting will accentuate your best assets and smooth out skin damages. When you’re taking a selfie, make sure you have a good source of light in front of you (unless you’re going for a more dramatic look – in this case light coming from the side will give you a deep, contrast-y feel), or simply pop on your selfie stick’s headlight for consistent lighting that will make you look just awesome.


We believe everyone is perfect and beautiful in their own way. None of us have symmetric features or flawless skin... and that’s ok! But when we want to look good in a picture, when we need to present ourselves in a positive way – we need to find our best, most flattering angle. That much can be a tricky thing to do when taking a selfie, when your hand has to keep reaching for your phone to adjust it. That’s why we installed a tilt function into this selfie stick, so that you’ll be able to modify your phone’s angle and find your best look at the touch of a button. It’s just super easy. Try it.


The thing about selfies is that you don’t want to look like you’re trying too hard. The best way to achieve that? Just don’t try too hard! This selfie stick’s control panel, located at the base of the stick, surrounded by a rubber coat for maximum stability, gives you full control of all photographic elements, right at the tip of your fingers. Adjust zoom, light, tilt and more using the stick's control panel, so that one arm is always free to do whatever you want, and your overall pose is loose, dynamic and unassuming.






 

 

 

 



 


 


 


 


 


  

Awesome filters, fun effects, cool gif options, full control of all photography settings and more - the Pictar app has everyone you'll need for the perfect selfie!

After the launch of the Pictar mobile photography hub in 2019, we realized that one of the main things people are looking to do with their mobile photography is... taking selfies! We know selfies are big, that’s why we created the 1st generation of the Pictar Smart Selfie Stick, but were surprised to see it day in day out on our best sellers list. 
We then took a deep dive into Instagram, studied thousands of selfies, trying to figure out what is it that makes a good selfie and what are most people doing wrong. We realized that finding the right angle and achieving stability and control are key, but the secret sauce that’s missing from so many selfies is good lighting. 

Our product manager and lighting expert Sean immediately set out to build the team to design the perfect light this selfie stick – one that’s strong enough, adjustable enough and light to fit a selfie stick, without big or too heavy. After testing numerous options and designs, our team was able to develop and prototype the Pictar Smart-Light Selfie Stick, the ultimate stick for consistently perfect selfies!

My current camera (Canon eos 40D - 2008) is almost dying. I've made 60.000 photographs, and I can't buy new. Hopefully I will be admitted to University - Photography Department , that's the second reason why I'm asking for help.  
 
 Here is the video http://youtu.be/XmvGyTO2vGE

 
 
 
Thank you!

 Record everything that happens in front and behind you with 2x 143-degree 1080p Full HD video cameras 
 Check your blind spots through the intuitive HUD 
 Stay in touch with other riders with group calls 
 Save and share the GPS coordinates of your tour map 
 Get directions as you ride through the distraction-free HUD 
 Film a video of your epic ride and upload to social media 
 Listen to your favorite music or podcasts 
All without taking your eyes off the road or hands off the handlebars.Revan was designed following all standards of communication, helmet design and road safety in Europe, USA and Japan. 
 
  As bikers, we need to be aware of everything, in every direction. But flying down the roads, most of us have no idea of the dangers around us. There may be a car rushing through your blindspot or animals crossing ahead of you.And before you lift your sight or look over your shoulder, you’ve already lost some crucial reaction time, which can lead to accidents.You never know if or when something unexpected may happen, so take control of your safety at all times.With Revan, you're back in control. Its 1080p Full HD camera records everything behind, in front and to the sides of you and shows you a live-feed of your camera through its integrated heads-up-display.Use the HUD to also monitor your speed, location, time, battery levels and other useful metrics in real-time.  
 
 The ultrawide 143° field-of-view each of its front and rear cameras minimizes distortion and allows for the highest video resolution possible while capturing everything around you and your motorbike.   
 
 
 
 
 
  Having to tilt your head to look around at your surroundings is both inconvenient and potentially dangerous.That’s why Revan’s integrated HUD is strategically positioned in the lower right corner of the helmet, so you can see it at all times without having to tilt your head. Never strain your eyes or lose sight of the world in front of you, thanks to the infinity focus technology of the HUD. You can further refine the HUD’s position with micro-adjustments.HUD covers are available in two types—See-through and See-closed—to match your riding style.  

 
Follow directions through your HUD using Google Maps or our native navigation app.   Stopping to look at maps, or glancing down at your GPS will at best detract from your riding experience, and at worst is just unsafe. With Revan, you never need to take your eyes off the road. Directions are always visible through the HUD.  
  Revan works on your helmet. There’s no need to buy or use a special helmet. We know how carefully you’ve chosen your helmet and we don’t want you to give up on it. Revan is compatible with most full- and open-face helmets including your go-to HJC, SHOEI, and Arai.Mount it on your favourite helmet in under 20 seconds and set off on an exhilarating ride.  
 
 

 With the additional brackets, you can switch the dashcam between your favourite helmets. Revan’s integrated HUD too can be easily migrated using the enclosed small wrench. 10 seconds is usually enough to disconnect it.  
 Operate the HUD easily using the wireless Bluetooth remote control.Attach it to either side of your handlebars in a position that’s comfortable for you to reach. Individual buttons on the remote control provide tactile feedback and make it easier to monitor your blindspots, adjust the volume or make a phone call.  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 In an emergency, every second counts.With Revan's hands-free gesture control, you heighten your spidey sense. It detects the slightest preconfigured gesture—even a slight head tilt—and activates the rear-view camera in a split second to show you if there are any safety threats you should pay attention to.Quickly configure Revan’s sensitivity to your movements right from within its smartphone app.  
 
 
 As a member of the Hyundai and Kia Motors Incubator Programs in South Korea, the Revan team has access to supreme manufacturing techniques and resources to bring ultimate 2-wheel safety to all riders from all around the world.Kia and Hyundai also hold us to very high standards, ensuring we deliver an excellent product no matter what.  
 A fun trip can have us riding for hours, and you don’t just need to be safe for the first half. With Revan, you can ride in safety, knowing that you won’t run out of power—even on the longest journeys. 
 
 Smart helmets become dead weight if they don’t have power. Revan’s two lightweight batteries with 7,000 mAh of power will last you 12 hours of safe riding on a single charge.  
 
 
 
 
 
  With USB-C charging and its portable cigarette lighter socket, you can rapidly recharge your Revan’s batteries on-the-fly whenever you take a quick break. 
 No matter how fast you fly, Revan remains securely attached to your helmet. Even at exhilarating speeds of 124 mph (200 km/h), its aerodynamic form will not cause you even mild discomfort or fatigue.  
  
 
 
 Revan comes with its intuitive smartphone application. Use it to watch the live feed of your front and rear cameras, set up group calls, or adjust the settings in your HUD.  
  Riding in a group can be a breathtaking experience. But keeping in touch on the mountain curves can be a real nightmare. Revan enhances your collective riding experience, offering leader-centric group calling to keep in touch with everyone in the group.Whether it’s 5 or 50 of you, with Revan’s VoIP-based group calling, you can invite all your rider friends to a group call. The special permissions let the lead rider take control of the call by allowing other riders to talk and reduce the level of the chatter in the background.   
  Your GPS data is automatically collected as your footage is recorded.You can review the GPS track of your ride and create a tour map to share it with the rest of the riders in your group or save it for the next time you decide to ride that journey.  
  Record everything with Revan, so you can share it with all your rider friends on social media.Its directional microphone records crisp crystal clear noise-free audio alongside the Full HD video.Stream your ride live, save it for later, or easily upload it to social media via the Revan App or your preferred application. 
 Easily listen to your favorite music or podcast with crystal clear audio thanks to Revan's in-helmet speakers and Revan's smartphone app.Change tracks easily with the touch of a button from the remote.  
 
 
  Stay safe and visible from behind as you ride, thanks to Revan's integrated lights. Mounted on the battery module, the powerful LED lights allow other drivers to see you any time of night or day.

<p align=""left"">Traditional panoramic photography is very professional and the equipment is expensive. That's not for everyone. Recently there are some inexpensive lenses for iPhone coming out that could capture either 360° photos or interactive videos. But none of them could make them both. Why should we bother with two stand-alone lenses? Can’t we just hit two birds with one “Lens”? And meanwhile keep it simple, inexpensive and accessible to everyone? That is the idea behind this project. </p>
<p align=""left"">Then we found that if we re-design the fisheye lens and fit it to mobile phone, people could easily use it for making both 360° photos and interactive videos.</p>
<p align=""left"">So here it is:</p>
<p align=""left""><img alt="""" class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://sphotos-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash4/408255_237356436387054_2118130935_n.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 563px; height: 584px;""/></p>
<p align=""left"">                       </p>
<p align=""left"">We designed this brand new fisheye lens for iPhone/iPad, which could capture over 180° field of view in all directions (photo mode &amp; video mode). The app for unwrapping videos and stitch photos into 360° panorama is also needed. </p>
<p align=""left"">So the project consists of 3 parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href=""http://www.ipanocloud.com/product/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HotPano mini</a> – the re-designed super fisheye lens for iPhone/iPad.</li>
<li>
<a href=""http://www.ipanocloud.com/software/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Hot Pano</a> – the app to process the videos and photos shot with HotPano mini.</li>
<li>
<a href=""http://www.ipanocloud.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">iPanoCloud.com</a> – a one-stop platform for users to upload and share their works. People could also explore and find the most creative videos and photos on it.</li>

<p> </p></div>","Why We Start the Project?
Traditional panoramic photography is very professional and the equipment is expensive. That's not for everyone. Recently there are some inexpensive lenses for iPhone coming out that could capture either 360° photos or interactive videos. But none of them could make them both. Why should we bother with two stand-alone lenses? Can’t we just hit two birds with one “Lens”? And meanwhile keep it simple, inexpensive and accessible to everyone? That is the idea behind this project. 
Then we found that if we re-design the fisheye lens and fit it to mobile phone, people could easily use it for making both 360° photos and interactive videos.
So here it is:

                       
We designed this brand new fisheye lens for iPhone/iPad, which could capture over 180° field of view in all directions (photo mode & video mode). The app for unwrapping videos and stitch photos into 360° panorama is also needed. 
So the project consists of 3 parts:


HotPano mini – the re-designed super fisheye lens for iPhone/iPad.

Hot Pano – the app to process the videos and photos shot with HotPano mini.

iPanoCloud.com – a one-stop platform for users to upload and share their works. People could also explore and find the most creative videos and photos on it.
About ""HotPano mini""
HotPano mini is a super fisheye lens that could capture over 180° field of view in all directions.


What’s the difference between ""HotPano mini"" and ""normal ones""?
        
In the past 3 months, we’ve designed and tested 3 prototypes and now we are almost there.  
 

About ""Hot Pano"" App
 
The app to process the videos and photos shot with HotPano mini. As we can see the photo and video shot with fisheye lens are curved. By using this app, we could correct the distortion and give users the 360° immersive view. 
Features:
1.       Unwarp the video (shot with HotPano mini).
2.       Stitch fisheye images (captured with HotPano mini) into full 360° panorama.
3.       View 360° videos and photos in an immersive way (pan, tilt, zoom in/out).
4.       Upload data to www.iPanoCloud.com for storage and sharing.

<h3>You can see that there is a difference. I personally like the Lynny better, because of these reasons:</h3>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>1.) The blur doesn't cover most of the photo. If you were to move the lens on the Lensbaby around, all the way to the left, or right, the blur would still be on whichever side you point it to, as well as the other side. But with the Lynny, if you point the lens to the left or right, most of that side you point it to will be in focus, if not the whole side, depending on how far you point it to the side, and the other side will have the blur. It gives you more control with the Lynny, and doesn't blur most of the photo.<br/><br/>
</h3>
<h3>2.) The blur on the Lynny is more of a ""creative"" blur, it has an artistic look to it, not just a very soft blur like the Lensbaby has, at least to the Lensbaby I tried. The Lynny has more of a ""zooming"" look to the blur.<br/><br/>
</h3>
<h3>3.) The Lynny is different...Period. It just is. It's one of a kind. It's a really cool and fun lens to use for photography, which is the reason I love it most.<br/><br/>

<h3>If this campaign is successful, and you receive a Lynny if you fund it, you will definitely see what I'm talking about!</h3>

That's why I created the Lynny, so you don't have to do the post processing. The Lynny is YOUR tool to unleash your photographic creativity, your inner artist.
The original Lynny is made so you can focus on things from at least 5 feet (hypothesis), to as far as infinity. I also have available, a Lynny made for closer up shots (around a foot away) and also one for in between those two distances.
These Lynnys are only made for Nikon and Canon at the moment. I'd love to make these for other camera brands, and I plan to in the future, but I will have to make them and test them out on other camera brands, so as time goes by, I will consider other camera brands when I find out how well the Lynny works with them






The Effect


What will this project do for you and others? If this project is successful, the Lynny will be released and made available to the world, and give people something fun to do with their cameras and with other people. The Lynny is all about having fun and experimenting and just enjoying photography, period. If the campaign doesn't succeed, then it will not be possible to share my creation with the world and for everyone to enjoy the Lynny and it's effects. That would be a total bummer



What I Need For This to Be A Success
The parts I will need to do this are a good amount of money, and I will need to start off with about 500 of each to go somewhere with this. The parts I will need for the Nikon version of the Lynny will total to $7,250 for 500 of each parts


The parts for the Canon version of the Lynny will total to $7,900

And the Miscellaneous parts I'll need will cost over $1,500

I will also need about $10,000 to cover the costs of the parts I will need to make a Lynny Pro which I have already planned out.

Getting above the amount needed for this campaign will be a TREMENDOUS help, and it will allow me to purchase advertising spots on websites to put banners to advertise the product, as well as having the necessary amount of money to pay the fees to keep the domain name for the website active and running, and also to cover the costs of the web hosting service and any software I will need to build the websites and maintain it. It will too, allow me to have some extra room to expand this project, and do more upgrades to the Lynny to make it even better than it already is and will be. Also it would help me to have the money to open up the shop in my town to be able to offer these to people around here locally, and to purchase all the things I need to run the business, like a computer and software to complete transactions, as well as decorations, furniture, and any other things needed for the local shop.

Here is a comparison photo between the Lynny and the original Lensbaby. (See below for more info.)




You can see that there is a difference. I personally like the Lynny better, because of these reasons:

1.) The blur doesn't cover most of the photo. If you were to move the lens on the Lensbaby around, all the way to the left, or right, the blur would still be on whichever side you point it to, as well as the other side. But with the Lynny, if you point the lens to the left or right, most of that side you point it to will be in focus, if not the whole side, depending on how far you point it to the side, and the other side will have the blur. It gives you more control with the Lynny, and doesn't blur most of the photo.

2.) The blur on the Lynny is more of a ""creative"" blur, it has an artistic look to it, not just a very soft blur like the Lensbaby has, at least to the Lensbaby I tried. The Lynny has more of a ""zooming"" look to the blur.

3.) The Lynny is different...Period. It just is. It's one of a kind. It's a really cool and fun lens to use for photography, which is the reason I love it most.

If this campaign is successful, and you receive a Lynny if you fund it, you will definitely see what I'm talking about!",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Why?</b></p>
<p>Because we say so much with pictures. We use photographs to make people laugh, to tell stories, to express our emotions, and to preserve our most cherished memories.<br/><br/>When it comes to communicating visually, photos are great and video is even better. But the problem is we don’t live in a flat, two-dimensional world. It’s not our native dimension. When we communicate with ordinary photographs, we’re never really telling the whole story because the fact is, a photograph just isn’t the whole picture. But together, we can change that.<br/><br/>3D photography is possible, and we want to make it happen right now. <br/><br/><b>Features:</b><br/></p>

<br/>We're the same folks behind the Matter and Form 3D Scanner and Cashew3D.com.<br/><br/>We make the products we do because we believe that 3D hardware, software and content shouldn’t be expensive, complicated or unmanageable. We think that 3D content should be as easy to use as your smartphone or your favorite social network and we’re dedicated to creating products that make 3D truly accessible, affordable and easy to use.<br/><br/>Our company was started by friends. We needed a 3D scanner but we couldn’t afford to buy one, so we invented our own. Two years ago we decided to share our design with the world and asked the crowd funding community to help us make 3D scanning truly affordable and easy to us. The response we got was just incredible. Today, the Matter and Form 3D Scanner has sold thousands of units and ships all over the world.<br/><br/>Now, we want to put the power of 3D into people’s hands and totally change the way you communicate with Bevel.<br/><br/><b>Risks and challenges</b><br/><br/>As with any product development, unforeseen challenges are inevitable. The good news is, this is our second crowdfunding campaign and the third product we're bringing to market, so we have a pretty good idea of what lies ahead and we're well equipped to deal with whatever comes our way.<br/><br/>That being said, common obstacles that come up for product designers like us include: <br/><ul>

</li>
</ul>
<br/>As always, we are dedicated to making sure you know what is happening every step of the way. We'll be updating you folks regularly and letting you know exactly what's going on as Bevel development progresses.<br/><br/>After all, we're doing this together.<div><br/></div>
<div><b>FAQ</b></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>Will it fit my phone in a case?</b><p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p>Most likely. We've designed Bevel to fit most smart phones or tablets with most slim cases. However, there are so many cases and phones in the world it's impossible to be sure. If for some reason the Bevel does not fit your phone, you can contact us for a refund.<span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<b>Can I use this like a 3D Scanner?</b><br/><p style=""font-weight: bold;""></p>
<p>Yes, but, Bevel isn't designed to be a 3D Scanner, but a 3D photography attachment. First and foremost it's about capturing moments and sharing them in 3D. In order to use Bevel as a scanner, you may need to use Cashew to help process and download your model, and possibly a 3rd party software to clean and make manifold for printing.</p>
<p><b>What distance does Bevel work at?</b></p>
<p>Depending on your phone, the optimum distance with the laser is about 1 meter. In a future release, we are planning on using the Bevel to capture entire buildings, and even cities.</p>
<p><b>Can I 3D print my photo?</b></p>Yes. But keep in mind Bevel is designed for creating Genuine 3D™ photographs. At the moment, the photos you take with the Bevel can be downloaded directly from Cashew as OBJ, STL, PLY and DAE. Cashew will also soon have a feature that will help make your models water tight.</span></div>
<div><b>Can I use Bevel outside?</b></div>
<div>Bevel uses visible light to capture 3D data, and so bright light like direct sunlight is a problem. We're working on ways to get you a result even in the least ideal conditions, but the best results are indoors with standard lighting.</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><p style=""font-weight: bold;"">Is there a minimum megapixel needed for my camera on my phone?</p>
<p>No, there is no minimum quality required as of yet. But please note, we've seen better 3D photos with an iPhone 6 camera over an earlier iPad.</p>
<div><p></p></div>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">What type of phone do I need to have?</p>
<p>Bevel will work with most modern smartphones and tablets. While it's impossible to know for certain ahead of time the details of each and every possible combination for Bevel and smartphones or tablets, we have designed the device for a universal fit and we have a fairly good idea about requirements.</p>
<p>Here are some basics to help you decide:</p>
<p>For both Android and iOS we recommend that your device has an accelerometer and a gyroscope. Or at minimum a 6-Axis accelerometer. Phones with no gyroscope may get different results. Also we recommend having Kit-Kat or higher.</p>
<p>For iOS devices, we recommend any devices that can run iOS 8 and higher.</p>
<p>Other phones and tablets are likely to work and we will do our best to consider them, however, as a starting point, the list above is our development threshold.</p>
<div><p></p></div>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">What is the battery life / charging time?</p>
<p>Bevel works a lot like the flash on your phone. If the laser was to be used constantly, it would provide roughly 3 hours of battery life before needing to be charged. Depending on how many photos you take, this should get you through the day, roughly matching your phones battery life. </p>
<p>Charging time on a standard adapter should be anywhere from 20 - 30 min. <br/>The Bevel does not use power from your phone, and will be charged with a separate cable.</p>
<div><p></p></div>
<p style=""font-weight: bold;"">What file formats are supported?</p>
<p>At the moment, the photos you take with the Bevel can be downloaded directly from Cashew as OBJ, STL, PLY and DAE. <br/>Bevel's native file format, as well as export options, have not been decided on yet. We are open to suggestions if you have a preference.</p>
<div>
<p></p>
<p><b>Can you scan from 360 degrees?</b></p>
<p>We haven't gotten to that point in our development, but yes, that has always been our vision. Keep in mind though, that for 360 degree scans, you subject will have to remain still. Because of processing times, longer, or more elaborate Bevel photos, may end up being an advanced feature.</p>
<p><b>Do you support Blackberry or Windows Phone?</b></p>
<p>Our goal is to under-promise, over-deliver. We'll make Bevel available to as many people as we can, but right now we can only promise iOS and Android.</p>

Bevel uses an eye safe laser light and the existing camera on your Android or iOS device, to capture photographs in a whole new dimension. Simply plug it in, and pan the person, place or thing you want to capture. Bevel creates beautiful 3D photographs that you can use in amazing ways.

3D photo taken with an early Bevel prototype

What does a Genuine 3D™ photograph look like? 
We're still in development, but below are a couple of examples of Bevel Genuine 3D™ photographs of team members Laura and Travis that were taken with early prototypes. These are super early, and we expect the final photos to look like this or better. 
Click here to see Laura in Genuine 3D™Click here to see Travis in Genuine 3D™Genuine 3D™ photographs are like freezing a moment in time. The photos can be rotated, turned into animated GIFs and viewed from multiple angles. You can also add an image of the background behind the 3D photo. They can be shared through Cashew and the Bevel app directly to sites like Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Wordpress blogs, Instagram, Pinterest, etc. 

What can you do with Bevel's Genuine 3D™ photos?With the Bevel app you can do everything you do with ordinary photos. Post your 3D pictures on Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr, Twitter or any social network. Use the Bevel app to share directly to friends or upload and share them online with a link. Save them and even use them for animation, video game design and 3D printing.









Or, simply share directly to your contact list.



Why?
Because we say so much with pictures. We use photographs to make people laugh, to tell stories, to express our emotions, and to preserve our most cherished memories.When it comes to communicating visually, photos are great and video is even better. But the problem is we don’t live in a flat, two-dimensional world. It’s not our native dimension. When we communicate with ordinary photographs, we’re never really telling the whole story because the fact is, a photograph just isn’t the whole picture. But together, we can change that.3D photography is possible, and we want to make it happen right now. Features:

Pre-orders also include a Bevel keychain attachment so your Bevel is always at your side.

About Us:

We're the same folks behind the Matter and Form 3D Scanner and Cashew3D.com.We make the products we do because we believe that 3D hardware, software and content shouldn’t be expensive, complicated or unmanageable. We think that 3D content should be as easy to use as your smartphone or your favorite social network and we’re dedicated to creating products that make 3D truly accessible, affordable and easy to use.Our company was started by friends. We needed a 3D scanner but we couldn’t afford to buy one, so we invented our own. Two years ago we decided to share our design with the world and asked the crowd funding community to help us make 3D scanning truly affordable and easy to us. The response we got was just incredible. Today, the Matter and Form 3D Scanner has sold thousands of units and ships all over the world.Now, we want to put the power of 3D into people’s hands and totally change the way you communicate with Bevel.Risks and challengesAs with any product development, unforeseen challenges are inevitable. The good news is, this is our second crowdfunding campaign and the third product we're bringing to market, so we have a pretty good idea of what lies ahead and we're well equipped to deal with whatever comes our way.That being said, common obstacles that come up for product designers like us include: 

Shortages in hardware components 


Delays in customs 


Shipments that are lost or damaged 


Language and translation in the App and Manual (Bevel will be English only to start) 


Your phone: (We've designed Bevel to be a one-size-fits-all attachment and we're aiming to make Bevel work on any modern iOS or Android smartphone or tablet. We will discover which, if any, phones or tablets will not work with the Bevel once the project is underway and let you know asap if there are any issues)


As always, we are dedicated to making sure you know what is happening every step of the way. We'll be updating you folks regularly and letting you know exactly what's going on as Bevel development progresses.After all, we're doing this together.
FAQ
Will it fit my phone in a case?
Most likely. We've designed Bevel to fit most smart phones or tablets with most slim cases. However, there are so many cases and phones in the world it's impossible to be sure. If for some reason the Bevel does not fit your phone, you can contact us for a refund.
Can I use this like a 3D Scanner?
Yes, but, Bevel isn't designed to be a 3D Scanner, but a 3D photography attachment. First and foremost it's about capturing moments and sharing them in 3D. In order to use Bevel as a scanner, you may need to use Cashew to help process and download your model, and possibly a 3rd party software to clean and make manifold for printing.
What distance does Bevel work at?
Depending on your phone, the optimum distance with the laser is about 1 meter. In a future release, we are planning on using the Bevel to capture entire buildings, and even cities.
Can I 3D print my photo?Yes. But keep in mind Bevel is designed for creating Genuine 3D™ photographs. At the moment, the photos you take with the Bevel can be downloaded directly from Cashew as OBJ, STL, PLY and DAE. Cashew will also soon have a feature that will help make your models water tight.
Can I use Bevel outside?
Bevel uses visible light to capture 3D data, and so bright light like direct sunlight is a problem. We're working on ways to get you a result even in the least ideal conditions, but the best results are indoors with standard lighting.
Is there a minimum megapixel needed for my camera on my phone?
No, there is no minimum quality required as of yet. But please note, we've seen better 3D photos with an iPhone 6 camera over an earlier iPad.

What type of phone do I need to have?
Bevel will work with most modern smartphones and tablets. While it's impossible to know for certain ahead of time the details of each and every possible combination for Bevel and smartphones or tablets, we have designed the device for a universal fit and we have a fairly good idea about requirements.
Here are some basics to help you decide:
For both Android and iOS we recommend that your device has an accelerometer and a gyroscope. Or at minimum a 6-Axis accelerometer. Phones with no gyroscope may get different results. Also we recommend having Kit-Kat or higher.
For iOS devices, we recommend any devices that can run iOS 8 and higher.
Other phones and tablets are likely to work and we will do our best to consider them, however, as a starting point, the list above is our development threshold.

What is the battery life / charging time?
Bevel works a lot like the flash on your phone. If the laser was to be used constantly, it would provide roughly 3 hours of battery life before needing to be charged. Depending on how many photos you take, this should get you through the day, roughly matching your phones battery life. 
Charging time on a standard adapter should be anywhere from 20 - 30 min. The Bevel does not use power from your phone, and will be charged with a separate cable.

What file formats are supported?
At the moment, the photos you take with the Bevel can be downloaded directly from Cashew as OBJ, STL, PLY and DAE. Bevel's native file format, as well as export options, have not been decided on yet. We are open to suggestions if you have a preference.


Can you scan from 360 degrees?
We haven't gotten to that point in our development, but yes, that has always been our vision. Keep in mind though, that for 360 degree scans, you subject will have to remain still. Because of processing times, longer, or more elaborate Bevel photos, may end up being an advanced feature.
Do you support Blackberry or Windows Phone?
Our goal is to under-promise, over-deliver. We'll make Bevel available to as many people as we can, but right now we can only promise iOS and Android.",14.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p class=""p3""><span class=""s1"">Five fully manual 35mm cameras will be pre-loaded with a single roll of film and packed into five separate camera bags. The bags will be shipped overnight across the world from one photojournalist to the next - one in a small town in the middle of the U.S., another among relief efforts in a natural disaster zone, or working the White House press pool. Each photojournalist will get only one click of the shutter.</span></p>

Project Synopsis 

• 
The Mission 

One camera. One click. One moment.

In an age where digital photography, the Internet, and motor drives have accelerated the process of image-making, the thought, vision and construction of the decisive moment gets lost in the rush. FOCUSED will bring a diverse group of photojournalists from across the world together one frame at a time towards a common goal: to rely more on our senses than technology.

One roll of film will hold thousands of miles of travel with photo subjects as diverse as the areas they are sent. Frame by frame, the viewer will get a glimpse of the thought process behind making one singular, thoughtful image.

The Project

Five fully manual 35mm cameras will be pre-loaded with a single roll of film and packed into five separate camera bags. The bags will be shipped overnight across the world from one photojournalist to the next - one in a small town in the middle of the U.S., another among relief efforts in a natural disaster zone, or working the White House press pool. Each photojournalist will get only one click of the shutter.

Just one click.

Photojournalists will document their photos not only on film, but in hand-written journal entries with quotes and technical specs from each situation. Journal entries will be scanned and published alongside the images on the website along with any future gallery showings and publications.

All cameras, film canisters, and notebooks will be retained as a historical record of the project and be used in future gallery showings and print publications.

The Benefit

This is an unprecedented opportunity for hundreds of photojournalists to work together. In addition, all of the money raised through unused donations, print sales, book sales, etc., will go to fund youth photography programs across the globe.  FOCUSED has partnered with Critical Exposure in Washington DC, The AjA Project in San Diego, Through the Eyes of Hope in Rwanda, and Fundacion Ph15 in Argentina to help build their wonderful programs teaching photography to underprivileged youth.

<h2>What is NEMOART?</h2>
<p><strong><em>""NEMOART : 3D Modeling + Rendering + Compositing""</em></strong></p>
<p>Today, many people share their daily lives and pictures on SNS with others. Most of those pictures are taken by their smartphones instead of real cameras. In addition, people give digital filter effects to the photos. They also purchase or make our own labels to add it. Thanks to the development of smartphones and widely used SNS, everything became possible and easy. Everything began from the human desire to express ourselves. In near future, the technology that helps to express oneself in better way will take part in our lives for certain.</p>
<p><strong>Q : What will be “the Next Generation” photo editing that we desire?</strong><br/><strong>A :</strong> We already have gone through the revolution of Computer Graphics (CG) in the movies, games, architecture, and so forth. CG brought us the satisfaction of “virtual reality”.   </p>
<p><strong>Q : What makes the CG possible in the movie? And why can’t we achieve it easily?</strong><br/><strong>A :</strong> The answer lies within the 3D modeling, image compositing, and rendering technology. These bring the realism into the movie screen. However, It is very difficult for the average users to utilize it, because the 3D modeling isn't easy to learn and intuitive to use. Moreover, Image compositing and rendering tasks are expensive to perform and to operate. </p>
<p>So, that’s why <strong>NEMOART</strong> is here for us.<br/>NEMOART provide the photorealism to your precious photos. You only need to put the 3D model formulated by cubes and make one simple click. Then, everything is fully responsible to NEMOART rendering cloud service.</p>
<p><strong>Q : What kind of 3D cubes can we put into the photos?</strong><br/><strong>A :</strong> You can use 3D cubes made by other users or experts, or you may make one on your own. All the steps are as easy as playing with ‘LEGO’ blocks.</p>
<p>NEMOART is the first service that provides modeling, compositing, and rendering with one’s smartphone at once. It also has a meaning of next-generation in editing photos. </p>
<p>NEMOART is the first project of “BARI”. We imagine the virtual reality in the computer environment like Matrix. For such reason, we study and prepare various technologies other than NEMOART.<br/>We look forward to have your kind attention and contribution to our first service, NEMOART.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>NEMOART can formulate model and scene, and then it can process through Rendering Cloud Service.</p>

<h2>Photography rendered by NEMOART</h2>
<p>NEMOART creates all the things you can imagine: animals, cartoon characters, geography, things, effects, signature and even your avatar. And, the NEMOART’s rendering can give breath to a new life into your 3D creation. Furthermore, your 3D creation can be alive in your photo. Followings are simple examples that show how you can create realistic images. </p>
<p><img alt=""Photos"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-RWs36o9BLpc/UVRl9Sz3NTI/AAAAAAAAAGU/Zcpg8l1_9lE/s861/photos.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""Photos""/></p>
</div>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Photorealistic effect </h2>
<p>As above gallery samples have shown, NEMOART’ rendering makes your 3D creation into reality. Using several materials such as glass, plastic, and mirror, your 3D creation seems to be genuine with proper exposure. This is one of the most powerful weapons in NEMOART. NEMOART generates natural light as if your 3D creation is originally in the photo. Therefore, you just put your own 3D creation into photo in order to make a natural image.</p>
<p><img alt=""effect1"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-fdh5CRjYvpc/UVRl3KiP_zI/AAAAAAAAAFs/qUwahGLfQK8/s600/effect1.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""effect1""/></p>
<p>Your 3D creation is not a simple 2D emoticon anymore. It is reusable and recreative in various dimensions and in different spaces. These works are attributed to the following effects. In other words, it means that your 3D creation can be set in any position, and it can be adjusted to any sizes according to your photo composition. If it is created on your hand, it can be free anywhere. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Realistic material</strong></p>
<p>NEMOART supports several materials, which means that you can assign different materials to different cubes. Even though you make the same figure model, the rendering images depend on the materials which you choose. Your 3D model can be air, glass, metal and so on. It can also be light as well.</p>
<p><img alt=""effect2"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-MUqTgP2dbL0/UVRl3lvrfVI/AAAAAAAAAFc/w7QRzmJ8YzM/s900/effect2.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""effect2""/></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Natural light</strong></p>
<p>In real life, the same object looks different depends on where it is. If the object is under the hot sun, it seems to be vivid. On the other hand, the object is under the candlelight, it seems to be dim. NEMOART also provides the natural light based on the light source of your photo. Therefore, the same model can be appeared differently depending on the photo that you use. </p>
<p><img alt=""effect3"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vSbeWv1l9SQ/UVRl31ajabI/AAAAAAAAAFQ/-tyyz9w6usA/s600/effect3.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""effect3""/></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Reflection effect</strong></p>
<p>If you make a floor based on the reflective materials such as metal or mirror, you can see that another 3D creation of yours can be visualized on the floor with defined reflection. Furthermore, the objects that were originally in your photo also show reflection on the floor as well. This reflection effect makes 3D creation more realistic. </p>
<p><img alt=""effect4"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-4tC-S1XCyM4/UVRl4GEl6gI/AAAAAAAAAFU/owAFgOLh0lw/s600/effect4.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""effect4""/></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Refraction effect</strong></p>
<p>If you are using glass or air material, you can create refracted effects of your 3D creation so that it can show the back side of it. </p>
<p><img alt=""effect5"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-z3E-COzA780/UVRl4US28VI/AAAAAAAAAFk/vMqCQfHcHDs/s600/effect5.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""effect5""/></p>
<p align=""left""><strong> </strong></p>
<p align=""left""><strong>Shadow effect</strong></p>
<p align=""left"">If you use shadow effect in NEMOART, one can finally achieve your 3D creation to perfection. You can make an actual shadow of your 3D creation in your photo. Most people won’t be able to differentiate whether it is real or not.</p>
<p><img alt=""effect6"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-WuG2gXjmGIs/UVRl45AmjZI/AAAAAAAAAFo/jCA8pL6at90/s600/effect6.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""effect6""/></p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h2>Rendering Evaluation</h2>
<p>Generally, the rendering requires a lot of computing resource and rendering time. (Even though NEMOART’s rendering is faster than the others, it also need a considerable amount of time.) Therefore, it is necessary to understand how to render its own 3D creation for creating a nice image. To increase efficiency of the image creation, we provide two levels of service quality: Low Quality and High Quality.  If you select low quality, you can get result quickly but with lesser image quality. On the contrary, if you select high quality, you can get high quality of image with little bit of longer time.</p>
<p><img alt=""evaulation1"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-U7nz8R_rx2g/UVRl2WjZdhI/AAAAAAAAAEs/yaovfCgLKQU/s822/Evaluation1.jpg"" src="""" style=""vertical-align: middle;"" title=""evaulation1""/>* Low quality(left) vs High quality(right)</p>
<p>If you would to estimate rendering time, you need to consider the elements which have an immediate influence to rendering procedures. Including quality of service, followings are the important elements related to rendering time. </p>

<h2><span style=""font-size: 1.17em;"">User interface</span></h2>
<p>For efficient 3D modeling and rendering, NEMOART consists of 4 scenes. All of the 4 scenes are intimately connected to each other. In each scene, you can see representative examples, make 3D objects, create realistic photos, and share your results. </p>

</div></div>","Hello, friends, former (and future) photography workshop students, fellow photographers and anyone else who just happens to arrive on this page:    I will get right to the story of what happened and how you can help, and how I will thank you for helping:    Two weeks ago I parked my truck with a Leer shell at the Jackson, WY, Albertsons parking lot so that I could take a bus to the Jackson Hole Ski mountain and work my first day with the Adaptive Ski program.     Why did I park there? It's a popular local choice to avoid the 15 minute drive to the ski area and paying (and hunting!) for parking at the usually crowded resort, its a very public, and seemingly 'safe' place to park, etc. But sometimes these very public places are the easiest place for thieves to work, I have begun to understand.     Well I took a duffle bag with necessary gear for the day with me and left behind a Jansport ski pack still packed from a backcountry excursion the day before, with the following items:1:   My 2014 Canon 70D with a  Canon 18-135mm lens in it. Value: $1350.002:   A Black Diamond avalanche shovel: $75-90.003:   A Patagonia Torre ski jacket: $420.004:   A Black Diamond LED headlamp: $35-60.00 5:   Black Diamond Climbing skins: $145.006:   A Smart Wool zip up wool shirt... $100       In all honesty, I almost never leave my camera in my ski backpack and in the back of the truck because I simply like having it in the cab of my truck with me for safety and for instant access should a photo arise; 99% of the time its with me. Thus, having left it in the pack, and the back of the truck, was an very rare event. But this is very important: I did lock it the shell, just in case.      I likely didn't even think about my Canon 70D still being in the pack when I came back from the outdoor excursion the day before, I guessI must have been tired. So it stayed in the pack all day in a locked shell, should have been safe, right?  I returned to Albertson's 8 hours later back to my truck, then went on about my business, truthfully I did not notice anything missing then.     And so.... it was not until the next day when on my way to work that I saw a Grand Teton sunrise scene worthy of a photograph, and I reached back for my camera...     Uh-oh...! WHERE is it???       Well... I knew it had been taken right away when I pulled over, went to the back of my truck, opened the shell, and: the entire ski pack and the above contents were no longer there.Apparently, the thieves simply pulled on the locked latch and the shell popped out; I guess it wasn't really as secure as I thought.  I have addressed this flaw by now, but it of course does not fix the very unfortunate theft.     Well... I promptly called the Albertson's grocery store and asked if they had surveillance video of the parking lot, to my surprise they said 'yes'.            Yet after filing a police report whereupon a kind officer from the Jackson police department reviewed the archived video of that day, it turns out that their video cameras did not extend out as far as where I was parked and therefore I was, essentially, just out of range.  There went that option for at least seeing the thieves in action. Actually catching them, of course , is a whole other matter.   The hindsight and lesson here is this: All that extra gear (that I mentioned above as stolen) and the pack should have been tossed into the cab of my truck. But I thought I was in a safe public place, you know? And it was secured, so I thought.                                                        And no!- I did not have renters insurance for theft of goods, etc, at all. My fault/responsibility and I have learned a big lesson here.  I have this insurance now, but of course it is too late in this case.        The worst part is that I had just purchased my Canon 70D in the early spring of 2014, total value $1350.00, on Amazon as part of a sweet kit that I bought to replace my old 60D.  Truth is, I haven't even finished paying for it yet, as I had financed it on a special Amazon offer.                                                       Okay, so:     There are many reasons why I hope to enlist your kind donation to replace my camera: I have been doing and involved in photography in a wide variety of ways for over 25 years now, including studying it at the college level and working it into my Natural Resources BS degree...  and it is truly an important passion of mine.      I could go into greater detail of my over 25 years of photography accomplishments, but that would take up way too much space here, and I am simply appealing to the goodness of you, my students and friends and fellow photographers, for I know I would help if you were in a similar situation-and remember, even $5-10 will be appreciated and useful.Please check out a few of my Facebook galleries:https://www.facebook.com/michael.grasseschi/media_set?set=a.2174133912010.2134692.1206678189&type=3           Also, below is a link my website: AND: If you buy any prints through my website during this campaign or beyond,  all the money I make there will most certainly go for the camera!     Its super easy: Just ""Add to Cart"" and there you go..      Hey-!-Did someone say ""Perfect Christmas Gift?""""        http://www.michaelgphotoandvideo.com           Finally, a major reason why I need your help replacing my camera on a sooner rather than later basis: * On January 3rd 2015 I leave for Portugal and the Azores Islands as part of a TV show filming trip, and I wont have a personal professional D-SLR camera to use and document this once in a lifetime trip!Believe me...if I could afford to replace my Canon 70D and the lens that was on it when stolen before I leave, believe me, I would not be here asking for your help!         So its really quite simple: I hope to replace this camera with as much of your grateful support as I can. Even $5 would help, of course :-)                                             WHY SUPPORT This Campaign:  FOR ALL OF MY previous 550+ photography students at the Crested Butte Wildflower Festival and in private request workshops, etc,  over the past 20 years (one is shown above) who have gained what I hope have been valuable and useful skills through my workshops, here is a way you can truly and genuinely 'thank me'.         For all those friends, family, and acquaintances over the years who have said ""I'd like to buy a print or support you in some way"", etc, here is your chance to help me out instead. It would truly mean even more.        Finally, the rest of my stolen gear was almost as important to me in other ways because of my over 35 years in the outdoors (and the outdoor industry  etc); so when and if I raise any $$ above the value of the camera, I will use it to replace those favorite backcountry essentials which had a total value of $700+.                                                                                                         When YOU DONATE (AND I SINCERELY THANK THOSE WHO ALREAD HAVE):    1: To anyone donating over $100:  You get a 2-4 hour photography workshop with me. Despite our likely distance (living here in Jackson, WY) we will make it work, somehow. Details to be worked out, I promise.          2: Anyone donating $50-$100:I will be available for all your photography questions for the next 3 months after this campaign ends, by phone or email, and I mean ANY questions at all; from the most simple ""Do brands of cameras matter"" when buying a new one to ""Help me understand depth of field before I go crazy."" Etc!         3: All $5-50 donations will get a 'free' print of any photograph of mine from my website or Facebook;  I am not sure how many of you will actually desire this, but it seems like an clear and worthy offering.Just for Fun:   
 I have a substantial media/photography resume that I you can go crazy with if you want to:  http://www.media-match.com/usa/cv/www.michaelgphotoandvideo.com

<div>
<h3>Where Do Your Contributions Go?</h3>
<p>I'm looking for $1250. You may ask, ""What will those funds cover?"" or ""What am I paying for here?"" It's simple:</p>
<p>I'm looking to purchase a brand-spanking-new <strong>Canon T5i kit</strong> right after it hits the website at my favorite online wholesale retailer. Pricing for this just-announced DSLR camera is not official yet; it will hit store shelves in April. Judging by the MSRP of the T3i and T4i kits at launch, the T5i kit will be priced at or around <strong>$1200 (tax not included)</strong>. These kits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Canon EOS Rebel T5i body</li>
<li>Canon EF-S 18-55mm Wide-Angle Lens</li>
<li>Canon EF-S 55-250 Telephoto Lens</li>
<li>Canon 300DG Camera Bag</li>
<li>8GB Class 10 SDHC Card</li>
<li>mini-HDMI cable</li>
</ul>
<h3>What Kind of Swag Do You Get?</h3>
<p>Each tier of donation includes a personalized and handwritten note from me sent via snail mail to your mailbox. If you so graciously donate $10 or more, I'll be more than willing to send some signed and numbered prints your way. Don't worry, these will be of higher quality than those seen in the gallery and will come without the nameprint in the corners. Contributors will be contacted via email once the campaign is complete to choose their desired prints.</p>
<h3>Houston, We Have a Problem</h3>
<p>Of course, with a flexible funding campaign, I may not reach my goal, however I still keep your contributions, and luckily I still get to send you my beautiful prints! While I may not be able to immediately purchase the camera kit, I will put in some more hard work at my job, and in time I'll come up with the rest of the funds to place my order for my new baby.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Impact My Life (and My Passion for Photography!)</h3>
<p>Any contribution you make will help further me in the art of photography. It would truly mean a lot if you can help make this dream into reality and allow me to continue pursuing photography, bigger and better than ever!</p>

We value and appreciate your support and are extremely excited to get the products over to you. </p><p><b>TEAM NYA-EVO</b></p></div>","FJORD 36 ACTION PACK AND REMOVABLE CAMERA INSERTS (RCI)It started with the grand ambition to make the best all-round adventure backpack on the market that allows you to carry precious camera gear safely in any unforgiving conditions. After a year of design, numerous prototypes, testing, and re-design, we are excited to introduce the NYA-EVO FJORD 36 Action Pack (36 liters / 2196 cu inch). Welcome to NYA-EVO, designed and tested in the Nordics.AS SEEN ON: USER VIDEO ONE TO DO IT ALLAn adventure camera backpack that you can take hiking, snowboarding, skiing, traveling, and climbing, the FJORD 36 is one Action Pack that does it all. Adaptable to exactly what you need, so can you be a smart and well prepared adventurer. PROTECTEDThe integrated RCI system is engineered to work with the bag so your precious gear is safe from the harshest elements. TESTEDProven in the lab and across the Nordics so it won't let you down.  PEACE OF MINDNot worrying about your gear means that you can focus on what's important, experiencing life.THE RCI UNITS, WHERE THIS BAG BECOMES SOMETHING REALLY SPECIALThe Removable Camera Inserts or RCIs are designed for optimal protection and customization. We understand that camera gear is extremely expensive, which is why our RCIs were engineered and tested to withstand major impacts. They were also designed to fit seamlessly into the FJORD 36, essentially, one was made for the other. The last thing you should worry about while on an epic adventure is if your costly gear will make it safely.  PACK IT YOUR WAYYou have a choice between three RCI sizes, small, medium and large. The benefit of having all three sizes is the freedom to customize and carry what you want when you want. When using one, the others can be left at home with the lid on to store your other gear. Every outing or assignment is different, be efficient and have the option to take exactly what you need.CARRY-ON COMPLIANTThe final size of the FJORD 36 was made to be carry-on compliant with most major airlines. Avoid problems and keep your costly gear with you while traveling.FLIGHT READYOur adjustable padded RCIs can be formed to perfectly protect your drone and other video equipment.BACK ENTRY We have design engineered into the bag a way to gain access to your gear in a matter of seconds without taking the bag off. Simply undo the chest strap and with the waist belt attachment secured move bag around to the front, unzip the back panel and you're in.COMPACT URBAN STATEWhen you don't have to lug around all your gear tighten the compression straps for a closer body fit, a more relaxed look and greater agility.SELF STANDINGThe majority of outdoor backpacks cannot stay upright and tip over without support. The FJORD 36 base is made of extreme wearing waterproof rubberized fabric (Hypalon) and was designed to support a packed backpack and allow it stand upright on its own.FLIP THEMThe shoulder straps were designed with a slight curvature for comfort but also usability. The right amount of EVA foam and density allows the straps to stay flipped in place when accessing the rear compartment. CLEVER DIVIDERThe divider zips and Velcros into place dividing the gear between the main and RCI compartments. The separation helps you avoid items falling into the RCI section and keeps the two spaces neatly separated.EXTERNAL GEAR CARRY ATTACHMENT POINTSSnowboard front | Tripod side or front | Skis side and front diagonal | Multiple ice-axes | Pole | Helmet | Large drone (helmet panel) | Gimbal (helmet panel) EXTERNAL NET CARRYEasily hold your bulky down jackets with the stretch mesh attachment which is also an ideal place to dry out your wet gear.THOUGHT-OUT ORGANIZATIONA multitude of pockets to organize your journey effectively and efficiently. A roomy front pocket is protective and planned-out with a small drain hole at the bottom so the water of wet gear can escape. A dedicated laptop sleeve that fits up to a 15"" MacBook Pro. There is also a stretch fabric zipper hip belt pocket among other access points, providing quick access to your valuables or other small items.   To make an impact, we knew we had to pay special attention to the materials and components of the bag. For that reason, every fabric has been purposefully chosen and each buckle is made to withstand immense pressure. The result is an adventure backpack that is made to last and worthy of the demanding professionals that own the FJORD 36.LAB TESTINGDrop test | Tensile pull test | Hydrostatic pressure test | Fabric | Shoulder strap | Carry handle | Compression strap | Waist strap | RCI D ring | RCI carry handle.FIELD TESTINGThe FJORD 36 Action Pack was used 12 hours a day for 26 consecutive days across the Nordics. Temperatures ranged from 37°F to -18°F (+3°C to -28°c)FABRIC The FJORD 36 uses Nylon 210 Denier Ripstop with a water-repellent coating on the front and a highly water resistant 0.1mm TPU film laminate on the backside. If that wasn't enough, each FJORD 36 Action Pack comes with it's own integrated rain cover that is taped seamed for good measure.  COMPONENTS The FJORD 36 uses highly water-resistant YKK zippers, strength-tested, glove-friendly buckles and glove friendly, lightweight aluminum pullers that give you fantastic control. The Action pack also has a hyper-strong waterproof Hypalon rubber base, which is extremely durable and made to withstand severe abuse.Yes, this is an extreme adventure backpack, yes, it is a highly adaptive camera backpack, and yes, this is a backpack for mountain bikers, skiers, snowboarders, and ice climbers. More than that, this is a backpack for world travelers, for people that go beyond known routes, for the ones that like to wake up on the edge of a mountain range, this is a backpack for people who want to travel in confidence.We designed engineered, lab tested, then field tested the NYA-EVO FORD 36 to allow people to go further than they have before, knowing that whatever they’re carrying will travel safely. Grab your Action Pack and experience what’s past your horizon.The FJORD 36 Action Pack has your back, go ahead, go further. HANG WITH US IN HONG KONG

<h3>Hi there!</h3>
<p>Once upon a time I worked in game development, but mostly just writing and localization (organizing translations). These days I'm learning my way around texturing and 3D modeling. I'm currently shooting texture resources with an old Canon A560 using CHDK custom firmware to generate RAW images along with the original JPGs, but the hardware is not quite up to par with the quality I want in my source material.</p>
<p>So I'd like to upgrade. But on a limited budget how do I do that? Crowdfund, and then give away the environment textures I photograph for free!</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>If you find the idea of royalty-free images appealing, donate one dollar. Then pass the word along. If I can't do this one dollar at a time, then there probably isn't enough use for something like this. :)</p>
<p>I'm looking into purchasing:</p>
<ul>
<li>a used Canon 5D or a new Rebel</li>
<li>a tripod</li>
<li>and building some mounts so I can get good head-on shots of subjects, even at weird angles.</li>
</ul>
<p>What do you get for contributing? Environment texture resource packs will be made available from my site under a Creative Commons license. You'll be free to share, remix, and use the texture resources royalty free in your hobby and commercial products.</p>
<p>If you run a site that archives textures for the community you too will be able to add them to your collection for free.</p>
<p>Each resource pack is downloadable from my Copy account, and all current and future packs will be posted on my website.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
</div>
<div>
<p>If you can't donate, or don't feel it's worth it to you, then share the link with someone you know who might find it useful.</p>
<p><strong>Overfunded?</strong></p>
<p>If, by some crazy reason, I get hugely funded I will split the extra funds between other Indiegogo projects and the Blender Foundation.</p>
<p>So donate a dollar, head over to Mootations.info and grab the latest image packs.</p>

<h3>Hello, from Stevie! </h3>
<p>We are students in our final year at university working on our final dissertation film and Middlesex University, London. The last 3 years have been a long journey of learning experiences for both Yasmin and McKenna, who are now putting everything they have got into their final film for their course. </p>
<p><strong>The Story</strong></p>
<p>Stevie is an 8 year old girl who is blind. She lives like any other 'normal' girl, but her recently widowed father feels Stevie needs surgery so she can live 'normally'. Unbeknown to her father, Stevie is happy the way she is, but goes ahead with the surgery anyway because she knows how happy it would make her dad.  </p>
<p>Stevie will be a 12 minute film set in Liverpool - the hometown of our Producer Yasmin. McKenna, originally from Mason, Michigan, wanted to experience making a film outside of London for her dissertation, and after their first visit to Liverpool felt that it was the right place. They began to look for locations &amp; cast in early November. Since then, the two have been on a second trip with their head of camera and sound, to asses any challenges or restrictions locations may have, as well as rehearsals with the cast. </p>
<p><strong>The Crew</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485620709/f2xqevzgklcqpoynehdh.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Yasmin our producer has spent her time at university gaining experience as a producer. This film is a culmination of her skills over the past three years, making a number of small films along the way. </p>
<p>McKenna, mainly from a cinematography and editing background, wrote ""Stevie"" with a friend of hers. Her work as a cinematographer and editor has brought invaluable skills to her directing role.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1485620800/xotufuqzlj6mrgqbtosk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This is our head of camera and sound. Dominika (left) our Director of photography &amp; Sound Designer (right) Martha Luigujõe have worked on a number of previous films with both Yasmin &amp; McKenna. Their relationship as a four has grown stronger over the past 8 months whilst developing the film, and are now working together like a well oiled machine to complete it. Dominika and Martha have been a huge part of the pre-production and development stages of the film, and have co-ordinated well with other departments whilst readying the storyboard's and other paperwork for the upcoming shoot. </p>
<p>Take a look at our DOP's website to see some of her previous work: <a href=""http://www.dbesinska.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.dbesinska.com/</a></p>
<p>Yasmin &amp; Mckenna have also recruited other colleagues from university to help in other departments such as lighting, continuity, make-up &amp; department assistants. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Why do we need your help?</strong></h2>
<p>We are looking for £1,500 for very basic elements of the film. We need to be able to feed our crew, pay the remaining balance for our locations (of which there are six!), pay to get the cast and crew from London to Liverpool, as well as buy two hard drives to store all of the files on our shoot days. Although very basic needs, these may not be met without your help and kindness! </p>
<p><strong>Whats in it for <i>you?</i></strong></p>
<p>As well as being able to help the get Stevie off the ground and onto your screens, you will be rewarded for such kindness. Each donation no matter what size will receive a personal thank you from the director and producer via e-mail. There will then be landmark donations that will each come with their own Stevie themed surprise, sent to you when the campaign has finished. </p>
<p>If our goal isn't reached - not to worry! Every penny will still go to the production, and compromises will have to be made.</p>
<h2>You're at university, right?</h2>
<p>Yes! This is the crew's final year at university, and our final grade is reliant on this film. We are not given any financial support by our university so it's up to us to fund ourselves. Until now it has come from our own pockets, which is why we need your help! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risky?</h3>
<p>Every film we have made until now throughout our university career has presented us with new and different challenges. Discovering new ones has only built up our reference list of what to do when any hurdle arises. So, what are <strong>some</strong> of the challenges we will face?</p>
<ul>
<li>Away from our university while shooting - We have already planned the logistics of our travels and where we will stay whilst shooting Stevie in Liverpool. We are planning our shooting schedule in keeping with where each location is placed (thanks to our two recce's.) We have also taken out the appropriate insurance for all of our equipment, as well as bringing extra equipment (such as camera and lights) in case something does go wrong. </li>
<li>Working with a young child - This is something that both Yasmin and McKenna were very apprehensive about - but after jumping in head first with rehearsals with Ava (playing Stevie) in October, McKenna and Ava's relationship has developed into a friendship, Stevie's character being at the centre.  They will also be bringing Ava to the set a couple of days before the shoot, so she gets to meet the crew and know what all of the equipment is used for, as to not be worried when faced with a camera on the first day of shooting. </li>

<h2>It's not all about the money! </h2>

<p>Some of you won't be able to help us financially, but there are still ways you can help our production get further. This could be by sharing our funding page with friends and family. You could also share our social media pages and follow our progress through the entire production, and share those too! </p>
<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to look at our campaign. Please take a look at our social media sites, and keep up to date with what we were doing. Send us a message on Facebook if you would like to ask us any questions about the film, or just have a chat! </p>
</div></div>","Hello, from Stevie! 
We are students in our final year at university working on our final dissertation film and Middlesex University, London. The last 3 years have been a long journey of learning experiences for both Yasmin and McKenna, who are now putting everything they have got into their final film for their course. 
The Story
Stevie is an 8 year old girl who is blind. She lives like any other 'normal' girl, but her recently widowed father feels Stevie needs surgery so she can live 'normally'. Unbeknown to her father, Stevie is happy the way she is, but goes ahead with the surgery anyway because she knows how happy it would make her dad.  
Stevie will be a 12 minute film set in Liverpool - the hometown of our Producer Yasmin. McKenna, originally from Mason, Michigan, wanted to experience making a film outside of London for her dissertation, and after their first visit to Liverpool felt that it was the right place. They began to look for locations & cast in early November. Since then, the two have been on a second trip with their head of camera and sound, to asses any challenges or restrictions locations may have, as well as rehearsals with the cast. 
The Crew

Yasmin our producer has spent her time at university gaining experience as a producer. This film is a culmination of her skills over the past three years, making a number of small films along the way. 
McKenna, mainly from a cinematography and editing background, wrote ""Stevie"" with a friend of hers. Her work as a cinematographer and editor has brought invaluable skills to her directing role.
This is our head of camera and sound. Dominika (left) our Director of photography & Sound Designer (right) Martha Luigujõe have worked on a number of previous films with both Yasmin & McKenna. Their relationship as a four has grown stronger over the past 8 months whilst developing the film, and are now working together like a well oiled machine to complete it. Dominika and Martha have been a huge part of the pre-production and development stages of the film, and have co-ordinated well with other departments whilst readying the storyboard's and other paperwork for the upcoming shoot. 
Take a look at our DOP's website to see some of her previous work: http://www.dbesinska.com/
Yasmin & Mckenna have also recruited other colleagues from university to help in other departments such as lighting, continuity, make-up & department assistants. 
 
Why do we need your help?
We are looking for £1,500 for very basic elements of the film. We need to be able to feed our crew, pay the remaining balance for our locations (of which there are six!), pay to get the cast and crew from London to Liverpool, as well as buy two hard drives to store all of the files on our shoot days. Although very basic needs, these may not be met without your help and kindness! 
Whats in it for you?
As well as being able to help the get Stevie off the ground and onto your screens, you will be rewarded for such kindness. Each donation no matter what size will receive a personal thank you from the director and producer via e-mail. There will then be landmark donations that will each come with their own Stevie themed surprise, sent to you when the campaign has finished. 
If our goal isn't reached - not to worry! Every penny will still go to the production, and compromises will have to be made.
You're at university, right?
Yes! This is the crew's final year at university, and our final grade is reliant on this film. We are not given any financial support by our university so it's up to us to fund ourselves. Until now it has come from our own pockets, which is why we need your help!

<h3>On-trend designs to up your photography game</h3>
<p>Replica Surfaces started with four must-have designs: <strong>two white-based</strong> and <strong>two color designs</strong>. Choose your favorites to create cohesive branding for your blog or business. Any two Surfaces pair perfectly together in an L-configuration (see how to get the look below) or next to each other in side-by-side Instagram posts. </p>

<h3>Food Blogger? Go ahead, get messy</h3>
<p>Replica Surfaces wipe clean with a damp cloth or, for the tough stuff, a spritz of kitchen cleaner. Seriously, I haven't found one substance that stains these things! Sriracha, red wine, or chocolate sauce? <strong>Replica can handle it</strong>. And don't worry, I didn't let the rest of the bottle go to waste (I'd insert the smirk emoji here if I could).  </p>

<h3>Rigid three-layer construction</h3>
<p>Other backdrops have their pros and cons. My goals? To pack as many pros as possible into one backdrop AND be the<strong> last backdrops you'll ever buy</strong>. And that starts with their construction. The rigid, three-layer design of Replica Surfaces means they're i<strong>ncredibly durable, glare-free</strong>, and able to stand upright with the help of our custom-fit stands (more about those below). Not shabby for something that weighs in at just 2 lbs and 3 mm thick. </p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Replica Stands: pair your favorite Surfaces to create immersive photos</h3>
<p>Replica Stands are custom-fit to<strong> hold any two</strong> Surfaces in an L-configuration. No more propping backdrops against awkward objects. The Stand's cutout-corner design ensures Surfaces lie flush against each other without any unsightly gaps. Stands will be 3D printed using a blue-gray ABS plastic I like to call ""Blue Steel."" Did I mention you get a <strong>FREE set of Stands with every order of two or more Surfaces?</strong> I can't make Replica happen without your help and some Stand-shaped thanks are in order!</p>

<p>When I launched my first backdrop company in 2017, I ran into delays with production and importing. Now with 100% American production, those problems are gone!

<h2>Now shipping!</h2>
<p>After a bit of a delay, we are now shipping a much higher quality and better product than we set out to make.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525968934/z48mcllxyii6qsijktin.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We are outsourcing the manufacturing of the aluminium case which will improve production time and product quality. While this has increased the cost of the manufacturing, we still have a low cost product compared to many out there on the market and hope to still innovate on the design and make improvements over time.</p>
<p>We have improved the case with a quality powder coat instead of anodizing and have added a much higher powered WiFi module giving the CRF improved range, wall penetration and noise floor level.</p>
<p>The first units have started to ship in early May 2018, and we expect to finish shipping IndieGoGo orders by July.</p>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>My name is Jack O'Gara. I am a 3rd year student who is currently filming my final year film for my degree. Last year I saved up enough to buy my own wireless follow focus. While it is not a cinema brand product, its low cost, high build quality and simple technology got me working as an AC on a few projects as well as being able to use it on my own projects.</p>
<p>As I used the wireless follow focus system I learnt about these range finder accessories that help you nail your focus when using a laser or measuring tape was not an option. But these where several thousand dollars designed for high end industry, so well out of my range.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489065334/swatq2oylsz43robgdjv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>That is why I spent a few weeks last year working on my own solution. I created a concept prototype using some off the self components and an Arduino. I programmed it and got it working. After showing it off to a few film making buddies, they wanted one too..</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489065544/dgdljpkgelyqfkrua77a.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>So for the past few months I have turned this concept into a fully working prototype. And now we have the CineRangeFinder. A low cost, but high quality and accurate sonar range finder to make this industry tool accessible to more people like me. </p>
<p>This IndieGoGo campaign is to make this product a reality.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The CineRangeFinder</h3>
<p>The product is a small box that sits on top of your camera using a standard 1/4 inch 20 thread socket allowing you to use any magic arm or mount you have with the same thread.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489136164/jsyv1efm1flhkimd2v8q.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>It is able to range from 1 foot in front of the sensor up to 30+ feet and you can set the datum line forward or backwards to adjust for placement on your setup. You can also set it to readout in metric if you prefer.</p>
<p>There are dual quad segment displays on both sides allowing you to see the readout either side of the camera. They come standard as Red but are available in Blue, Yellow and White as an option. The displays can also dim for when you don't want full power.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489136179/gan6vvd7oujvh1f6hb7n.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>3 buttons located on the top of the unit allow you to access the menu system that allow you to change the datum line offset, switch between imperial and metric, dim the displays, change wifi channels and factory reset the device.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://thumbs.gfycat.com/JovialSplendidBandicoot-size_restricted.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>An optional wireless unit will be made available at a later date that will allow you to get the display readout if you prefer a different placement on the camera for the readout or when operating remotely.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489136196/fcgivrutmvxj1dpdkrpw.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>To power the unit there is a 2 pin LEMO socket on the rear of the device. You can also power it via the micro USB socket (not advised, it is there for future firmware updates)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>NEW CineRangeFinder Remote</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491425460/q4mmrl0xmds5aqpweueo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The CineRangeFinder Remote (illustrated above) is an accessory for your CineRangeFinder.</p>
<p>It allows you to read the display and access the menu system without having to be arms reach of the main unit that is on top of you camera.</p>
<p>Its 1/4-20 thread on the back allows you to mount it pretty much anywhere such as on a wireless display or even attached onto your wireless follow focus.</p>
<p>The range is expected to be over 50m.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I have already invested a lot into this project using my own savings. The R&amp;D and prototyping of the range finder was well over £1000. But that has gotten the project to a point where we are nearly ready to manufacture them. The software is done and I have built a working prototype. I have even gotten circuit boards manufactured for the prototypes.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489066732/wzag4j1fpyspqr9xywhm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I'm not looking for any money to go into the final development of the product. This is already happening and should be done by the end of the month. This IndieGoGo campaign is to allow you to fund the production run of the CineRangeFinder and receive one in return.</p>
<p>Expected shipping is May for the first 5 early birds, and June through July for the rest. This may be +/- a few weeks depending on a few factors. More info bellow.</p>

<h3>Crowd fund product levels/goals.</h3>
<p>Depending on the amount we raise will change the quality of the product that we are able to manufacture.</p>
<p><strong>Level 1</strong> - Up to 19 orders.</p>
<p>At this level we are able to 3D print the case and use off the shelf components as well as our basic circuit boards.</p>
<p><strong>Level 2</strong> - &gt;20 orders</p>
<p>At this level we can do a production run of milled plastic cases. These cases are strong and light weight but not as strong as Aluminium. Still a high quality product though.</p>
<p><strong>Level 3</strong> - &gt;30 orders</p>
<p>Fully custom circuit boards and components. No off the shelf parts. Allows us to also make the case a bit smaller.</p>
<p><strong>Level 4 </strong>- &gt;50 orders</p>
<p><u>This is our ultimate goal</u>. Aluminium milled case. Anodised matte black (custom colours might be available) with your name or organisation or logo inscribed on the case as an option to make it all yours.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This is the first product of what I hope to be many. Supporting this crowdfund and production run in return for the product will also help me start working on more concepts that I hope to bring to market. I really want to help bring these cinema level tools to more people and students to help create better films.</p>

<p> </p>
<div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As with any crowdfund there are risks and challenges that can arise. This is why I have tried to negate as many of these as possible. This is why I have personally funded all the development of the product, prototypes and software so that you are not paying for vaporware.</p>
<p>This means the only problems that can arise is from the production run. And to reduce those risks I have made sure that we have multiple avenues made available for all of the production steps from the circuit boards to the case. This means I have multiple places to purchase components, raw goods and tools as well as multiple places to get things manufactured that I personally is not manufacturing such as the circuit boards.</p>
<p>We are expected to be shipping in May and June but this might be up to a month behind if we face any unforseen problem. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you don't want the product, if you believe that it is an awesome idea and possibly know people who would like it, please share this page with them! To make this as successful as we want it to be we really need as many orders as possible.</p>
<p>Sharing this on social media or on forums can really help!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>Q: Why is the sensor and display together in the same unit?</p>
<p>A: To split them would raise the cost of the product by way over $100 because of the extra cables and connectors alone. Because of this we have designed it to be a single unit but have added wireless to it to allow you to use an accessory we hope to release soon that will allow you to have the display mounted anywhere on the camera or even used remotely.</p>
<p>Q: How accurate is the sensor?</p>
<p>A: Very! The manufacturer specify that it is 1cm throughout most of the range of the sensor.</p>
<p>Q: Does the environment or certain clothing items cause problems?</p>
<p>A: Yes. The product uses sonar technology, while accurate, some environments and materials will cause it to be inaccurate or not even be able to range. This is because the sensor sends out an inaudible sound which bounces off the surface in front of it to measure how far away it is. If the surface in front of the sensor absorbs too much, it would be able to accurately measure the distance or even measure at all.</p>
<p>Q: How much power does the device draw?</p>
<p>A: Not much. We have not accurately measured yet, but measurements we have taken show it takes just over 1W. Enabling the wireless will increase this.</p>
<p>Q: How efficient is the sensor?</p>
<p>A: We are still testing this. On shoots I have have been on we are finding it works best at ranges between 1 and 15 feet. This is where it is most useful especially on wide angle lens. Narrower lens we are finding it works fine at 20+foot, though the reading can bounce around a bit due to more objects in the environment bouncing the sonar sound wave. Anything over 30 foot it is not useful. Mostly because the sensor wont range this far and typically in most set environments there will be too much environmental noise at this range. Manufacture specified range for human detection is upwards of 15-16 feet.</p>
<p>Q: What if you get upwards of 100 orders?</p>
<p>A: This would be amazing and I hope it happens. If this happens we can make the cases to a really high quality. There might a short delay as we will be looking to source better manufacturing equipment, but it will be worth it and long term will allow us to make the accessories such as wireless remote much better too.</p>

As with any crowdfund there are risks and challenges that can arise. This is why I have tried to negate as many of these as possible. This is why I have personally funded all the development of the product, prototypes and software so that you are not paying for vaporware.
This means the only problems that can arise is from the production run. And to reduce those risks I have made sure that we have multiple avenues made available for all of the production steps from the circuit boards to the case. This means I have multiple places to purchase components, raw goods and tools as well as multiple places to get things manufactured that I personally is not manufacturing such as the circuit boards.
We are expected to be shipping in May and June but this might be up to a month behind if we face any unforseen problem.

Q&A
Q: Why is the sensor and display together in the same unit?
A: To split them would raise the cost of the product by way over $100 because of the extra cables and connectors alone. Because of this we have designed it to be a single unit but have added wireless to it to allow you to use an accessory we hope to release soon that will allow you to have the display mounted anywhere on the camera or even used remotely.
Q: How accurate is the sensor?
A: Very! The manufacturer specify that it is 1cm throughout most of the range of the sensor.
Q: Does the environment or certain clothing items cause problems?
A: Yes. The product uses sonar technology, while accurate, some environments and materials will cause it to be inaccurate or not even be able to range. This is because the sensor sends out an inaudible sound which bounces off the surface in front of it to measure how far away it is. If the surface in front of the sensor absorbs too much, it would be able to accurately measure the distance or even measure at all.
Q: How much power does the device draw?
A: Not much. We have not accurately measured yet, but measurements we have taken show it takes just over 1W. Enabling the wireless will increase this.
Q: How efficient is the sensor?
A: We are still testing this. On shoots I have have been on we are finding it works best at ranges between 1 and 15 feet. This is where it is most useful especially on wide angle lens. Narrower lens we are finding it works fine at 20+foot, though the reading can bounce around a bit due to more objects in the environment bouncing the sonar sound wave. Anything over 30 foot it is not useful. Mostly because the sensor wont range this far and typically in most set environments there will be too much environmental noise at this range. Manufacture specified range for human detection is upwards of 15-16 feet.
Q: What if you get upwards of 100 orders?
A: This would be amazing and I hope it happens. If this happens we can make the cases to a really high quality. There might a short delay as we will be looking to source better manufacturing equipment, but it will be worth it and long term will allow us to make the accessories such as wireless remote much better too.

<h4><b>Range</b></h4>
<p>Pinout works with your smartphone at a distance of up to 30 meters (98 feet). </p>
<h4><b><a name=""battery"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Battery free</a></b></h4>
<p>Pinout does not require any battery power. It uses power from your camera, yes, but the amount of power it requires for a year’s worth of use is approximately the amount of power stored in a miniature button battery, so it does not use up your camera’s precious power.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><a name=""plan"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kits</a></h2>
<p>Pinout has many features for everyone from novices to professionals. To make it easier to choose, we’ve bundled features in easy to use kits, all of which come with one Pinout device. The Basic kit is very affordable with functions anyone can use such as loss prevention and remote control. The Pro kit is aimed at more advanced users who want to step up their photography with features such as time lapse and GPS (geotagging) function. For users that want it all, we have the Full kit with all features Pinout has to offer. Each feature is also available individually so you can mix and match depending on your needs.</p>

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>We started our company Zesty 6 years ago in Tokyo, Japan and were one of the earliest companies that acquired a MFi(Made for iPod, iPhone, iPad) license from Apple.  Currently we focus on IoT(Internet of Thing) and digital life. We have developed and introduced products on the market such as an infrared communication adapter, an RFID reading and writing adapter, a visible light communication SDK, a multi-function wireless remote controller, etc. </p>
<p>In 2012 we launched ZGR, a device to remote control Nikon cameras with iPhone, with the mission to make cameras and photography better. We received a lot of love for our ZGR series, so we decided to make it even better with the Pinout. This time, we wanted to make a product for everyone so we shrunk the size while adding tons of new features such as loss and theft prevention, easy to use remote control, and many more.</p>

<p>We have worked hard to get Pinout to where it is today and we have the technology and manufacturing process set. We hope to successfully finish our campaign by the end of January 2016, finish manufacturing by March, and get Pinout to the contributors in April.</p>
<p>If we get enough support, we will develop devices for other camera manufacturers ASAP, start the manufacturing process in May or June 2016, and ship the first batch out in July 2016. From our R&amp;D experience with developing previous devices in the ZGR series, we have the technology to develop devices compatible with Canon and other manufacturers.

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Q: Why is Pinout only compatible with Nikon cameras? </span></p>
<p>A: Previously we developed a precursor to Pinout that is compatible with other camera manufacturers and we'd like Pinout to be compatible with other brands too. However, we do not have the funds currently to start developing and manufacturing Pinout compatible with other brands while keeping all its features. We decided to focus on one brand (Nikon) to put this cool device on the market as soon as possible, and hopefully use the funds we raise to expand compatibility to other brands. </p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Q: I don’t have a Nikon camera, but I’m interested in Pinout. Should I contribute to your campaign? </span></p>
<p>A: Yes! Your contribution will help us reach our campaign goal, and if we reach our campaign goal, we will start development and production of Pinout compatible with other brands ASAP. We already have the technology to make Pinout compatible with most Canon DSLRs; if there is demand we are prepared to answer it! Your feedback is very important for us, so please let us know if you’d like us to develop Pinout to be compatible with your favorite brands in the comments section. </p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Q: I’ve ordered the Basic Kit, but I want to add features while the campaign is still ongoing. Can I upgrade to Pro or Full Kit?</span></p>
<p>A: During the campaign, you can donate 7 USD to unlock premium features at a discounted price, so you can add whichever features you'd like. However, once the transaction is complete for a contribution, you cannot change it to another kit. You can also add additional features at any time after the campaign is over at the prices listed in the features table above or at <a href=""http://www.letspinout.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.letspinout.com</a>. </p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Q: Is there a limit to how many coupons I can buy? Is there an expiration date on the coupons?</span></p>
<p>A: No limits or expiration dates! You can buy coupons for as many features as you need, and they can be unlocked whenever you need. These coupons are also valid for Pinout compatible with other camera brands such as Canon, when we release it in the future. You can show support and demand for Pinout compatibility with other brands and by purchasing these coupons now, enabling us to release Pinout for other brands soon. </p>

We wanted to create a device to make DSLRs more accessible for everyone—and thus, Pinout was born. Pinout is not just a remote control for your camera—it is a theft prevention device, GPS, remote control, and supports HDR imaging, time-lapse, and many other features all rolled into one small, slick device + free application for smartphones. It has features for the professional cameraperson but is easy enough for anyone with a smartphone to use. Like a pin defining spaces on a map, Pinout is a tool that can help you make your surroundings your own through photography.   The featuresRemote shutter release Make that perfect, DSLR-quality selfies and hassle-free group pictures a reality. Pinout has no wires, and is easily controlled via an app on your smartphone. You can snap a picture with the volume control button, a simple click using the app, shaking your phone, or even by simply saying “CHEEESE” with the voice command mode.  Remote release is a popular tool used by serious photographers both outside and inside for shooting wildlife, scenery, and studio shoots. One reason is because when you manually press the shutter on your camera, even the steadiest of us send a small vibration to the camera body leading to blurry pictures. With Pinout, you can capture that crisp, beautiful shot of sunset you always wanted.  Loss/theft preventionExpensive cameras are an easy target for theft. With Pinout, you can set your smartphone to alert you when your camera goes 20 or 30 meters (up to 98 feet) away from your phone, with your camera on or off. No more leaving your camera somewhere and forgetting it behind. You can even track the point where your camera went out of range if it does get lost or stolen. GPSWith the GPS feature, you can automatically geo-tag your photos by recording GPS position data of each picture you take into EXIF information, as you shoot. Moreover, on the easy-to-use map interface on the dedicated app, you can set your location to the place you’re taking a picture of. For example, you can take pictures of Mt. Fuji from hundreds of kilometers away and set your location to Mt. Fuji so that all of your pictures are automatically tagged with what’s actually in the picture. Automatically geotagging saves a lot of time in the long run and also makes it easy to share location of the shoot when you share photos on social media.  High-dynamic-range (HDR) imagingHDR imaging allows you to take better pictures by adding more “dynamic-range” or ratio of light to dark. The same scene is shot multiple times with different exposures and all images rendered together to yield a “HDR” image that is closer to what your eyes see than what your camera “sees”. Recent smartphones come with HDR imaging function but with DSLRs the process is cumbersome as it requires manual editing. Pinout makes taking better pictures of landscapes, low-light or backlit scenes with your DSLR much easier. Time-lapseA series of pictures are captured at a particular interval and played back to yield what looks like a video. This feature is perfect for capturing subtle changes to scenery or objects over a period of time. Time-lapse allows you to cut through the noise and observe things from a different perspective by manipulating the flow of time.Moreover, you can also perform distance-lapse with Pinout which allows you to take a series of pictures with interval of a particular distance, instead of time. For example, you can strap your Pinout-attached camera to your car’s roof and drive around your neighborhood to capture scenery that changes with distance. With Pinout, you can easily set the interval, number of frames to shoot, and exposure on the app. With the premium function, you can set exposure of each frame individually as well. Once you press start, Pinout receives the command and starts the time-lapse, allowing you to watch videos, surf, or even turn off your smartphone. Pinout also offers advanced options with time lapse such as preset for shooting star trails, HDR time lapse, and bulb ramping. Multi-camera controlPinout app can control up to 10 cameras simultaneously, so by setting up cameras at different angles you never miss the perfect angle for that perfect moment. Great for photographing sports! Sensor-based photography (under development)DSLR cameras have few sensors built-in but smartphones come packed with sensors such as motion sensor, vibration sensor, face detection sensor, along with camera and microphone. Pinout can use your smartphone's sensors to enhance DSLRs’ capabilities. We have some cool features under development but we'd like your feedback so feel free to let us know what you want!Some features we're thinking of developing:Lightning sensor: Capture perfect lightning shots with Pinout. Flash of bright light (such as lightning) captured through your smartphone’s camera activates your camera’s shutter through Pinout. You can set the sensitivity at which it activates through the app on your smartphone.Motion sensor: With this feature on, any changes in your smartphone’s position triggers the shutter on your Pinout-connected camera so you can snap a picture at the moment your phone moves.  Compact designThe stylish pin-shaped design in black and red blends in seamlessly with Nikon DSLRs, adding a cool accent to your camera. The compact size also means Pinout doesn’t get in the way when shooting, and there is no need to take it off before stowing it away in your camera bag. It attaches to  the accessory port, leaving the hot shoe free for an external flash unit. 
Range
Pinout works with your smartphone at a distance of up to 30 meters (98 feet). 
Battery free
Pinout does not require any battery power. It uses power from your camera, yes, but the amount of power it requires for a year’s worth of use is approximately the amount of power stored in a miniature button battery, so it does not use up your camera’s precious power.
 
Kits
Pinout has many features for everyone from novices to professionals. To make it easier to choose, we’ve bundled features in easy to use kits, all of which come with one Pinout device. The Basic kit is very affordable with functions anyone can use such as loss prevention and remote control. The Pro kit is aimed at more advanced users who want to step up their photography with features such as time lapse and GPS (geotagging) function. For users that want it all, we have the Full kit with all features Pinout has to offer. Each feature is also available individually so you can mix and match depending on your needs.

Our Story
We started our company Zesty 6 years ago in Tokyo, Japan and were one of the earliest companies that acquired a MFi(Made for iPod, iPhone, iPad) license from Apple.  Currently we focus on IoT(Internet of Thing) and digital life. We have developed and introduced products on the market such as an infrared communication adapter, an RFID reading and writing adapter, a visible light communication SDK, a multi-function wireless remote controller, etc. 
In 2012 we launched ZGR, a device to remote control Nikon cameras with iPhone, with the mission to make cameras and photography better. We received a lot of love for our ZGR series, so we decided to make it even better with the Pinout. This time, we wanted to make a product for everyone so we shrunk the size while adding tons of new features such as loss and theft prevention, easy to use remote control, and many more.

But we need your support!

We want to know more about you—the user’s—needs. This is one reason why we’re crowdfunding, because we want to build a community and get feedback from users. Please feel free to leave us comments and suggestions on what to develop. Let’s work together to enhance the DSLR experience! 
Currently our product comes in two types, A and B and can only be used with Nikon cameras. We have the technology to expand compatibility with cameras from other manufacturers, but we don’t have enough funds to start production. If the campaign succeeds, we plan to make Pinout compatible with other camera makers. 
We want to expand and improve on features. We have already developed many free and premium features but there is still room for improvement. 
If our campaign succeeds, we can speed up the development and manufacturing process.

Plan
We have worked hard to get Pinout to where it is today and we have the technology and manufacturing process set. We hope to successfully finish our campaign by the end of January 2016, finish manufacturing by March, and get Pinout to the contributors in April.
If we get enough support, we will develop devices for other camera manufacturers ASAP, start the manufacturing process in May or June 2016, and ship the first batch out in July 2016. From our R&D experience with developing previous devices in the ZGR series, we have the technology to develop devices compatible with Canon and other manufacturers. We just need your support ☺
We want to hear from you! Please leave a comment with any questions!
 

 
Packaging
We've produced a convenient case to store Pinout when it's not connected to a camera. The case is small enough to fit in a packed camera bag but big enough to not lose it easily.

FAQs:
Q: Why is Pinout only compatible with Nikon cameras? 
A: Previously we developed a precursor to Pinout that is compatible with other camera manufacturers and we'd like Pinout to be compatible with other brands too. However, we do not have the funds currently to start developing and manufacturing Pinout compatible with other brands while keeping all its features. We decided to focus on one brand (Nikon) to put this cool device on the market as soon as possible, and hopefully use the funds we raise to expand compatibility to other brands. 
Q: I don’t have a Nikon camera, but I’m interested in Pinout. Should I contribute to your campaign? 
A: Yes! Your contribution will help us reach our campaign goal, and if we reach our campaign goal, we will start development and production of Pinout compatible with other brands ASAP. We already have the technology to make Pinout compatible with most Canon DSLRs; if there is demand we are prepared to answer it! Your feedback is very important for us, so please let us know if you’d like us to develop Pinout to be compatible with your favorite brands in the comments section. 
Q: I’ve ordered the Basic Kit, but I want to add features while the campaign is still ongoing. Can I upgrade to Pro or Full Kit?
A: During the campaign, you can donate 7 USD to unlock premium features at a discounted price, so you can add whichever features you'd like. However, once the transaction is complete for a contribution, you cannot change it to another kit. You can also add additional features at any time after the campaign is over at the prices listed in the features table above or at www.letspinout.com. 
Q: Is there a limit to how many coupons I can buy? Is there an expiration date on the coupons?
A: No limits or expiration dates! You can buy coupons for as many features as you need, and they can be unlocked whenever you need. These coupons are also valid for Pinout compatible with other camera brands such as Canon, when we release it in the future. You can show support and demand for Pinout compatibility with other brands and by purchasing these coupons now, enabling us to release Pinout for other brands soon.

<div>As many of you will already know, I'm an amateur photographer, and I'm spending the summer in New Haven taking classes. I had gone into New York on June 29th to see a play for my English seminar, and I wound up walking all over town to see a friend's concert at the Bitter End. By the time I got on the train back home to New Haven, I was exhausted, and when I left the train that night, I left without my camera case, which contained my Canon T3i, several lenses, a flash, memory cards, etc. </div>
<div>That part was absolutely my fault. No two ways about it. </div>
<div>MetroNorth has a great reputation for returning lost possessions, and I was at the last stop on the last train of the night, so chances were good that I might get my camera bag back. Unfortunately, this didn't happen. My camera was never entered into the lost property system. It was clearly marked with my contact information. Whoever found it chose not to report the item to MetroNorth. Someone needed that camera more than I did, I suppose, and I'm fortunate to have enough in my life that I can absorb the loss of a camera. It isn't my livelihood. </div>
<div>It is, however, a passion and a hobby that enriched the lives of my friends and the organizations that I've worked with over the last few years.</div> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>I'm fundraising to replace my camera and the accessories I need to keep up my photography. I've set an $800.00 dollar goal which will allow me to purchase a camera body, flash, lenses, and memory cards. With this, I'll be back and better than ever.</p>
<p>For anyone that contributes $25 or more to my campaign, I can offer an hour in front of my camera to anyone who lives in the NYC or New Haven/Yale area. I will shoot whatever you want, whenever I can during the September 2014 to May 2015 school year. I'll even edit them to your liking. I've got experience doing head shots and event photography, but if you've got ideas, let me know! This gives me an opportunity to practice my hobby, and you get photos. For samples of my work, check out my photo page on Facebook, Pichures by Kyle (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pichuresbykyle?ref_type=bookmark)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/pichuresbykyle?ref_type=bookmark</a> ). </p>
<p>If I fall short of the proposed goal, all funds will still be put toward replacing my camera over a longer timescale. Over the next year, I have the incredible opportunity to travel the world with the Yale Whiffenpoofs. I hope to have replaced my camera by no later than next May, when we leave for our world tour, but I don't want to wait to start taking pictures with this awesome group. </p>
<p>Yale has been a tremendous gift to me. It's sent me around the world. It's let me sing in Carnegie Hall. It has given me my best friends. As I head into my last year at Yale, I want to be able to take pictures, to preserve in what meager way I can what my alma mater calls ""the shortest, gladdest years of life.""</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your help, and I hope to see you very soon, though a lens or otherwise.</p>

</div></div>","RIP Canon EOS 40D - On December 22, 2012, Red Works Studio photographer Nadya K. updated her Facebook status with the following announcement:
""After nearly 5 years of steady shooting―7 tours throughout Canada and the U.S., event coverage for many First Nation businesses, groups and organizations, Canadian media, universities and publishers, several annual music/ film festivals and awards shows, youth workshops, and hundreds of photoshoots―it is with deep sadness to inform you all that my camera died this afternoon while shooting a Round Dance in front of Prime Minister Harper's (temporary) residence. Rest in peace, Canon 40D, December 22, 2012. We sure had some good times, met and helped hundreds of people over the years. Please join me. ... ....in a moment of silence.... ... .""
New Gear: Canon EOS 5D Mark III - The funds raised in this campaign go directly towards purchasing the Canon EOS 5D Mark III, which is a much needed upgrade from what I was previously shooting on, and will produce higher quality images, and camera features to support a broader range of shooting opportunities.


Canon EOS 5D Mark III (body only)
Plus 3 Year Protection Plan
The 3 year protection plan covers manufacturer defects, mechanical malfunctions, is a fully transferable warranty providing worldwide coverage and comes as a highly recommended plan with purchases of this category.


""Kwandibens' photos actively depict the Indian with passion and integrity. She captures an Indigenous spirit (individual and collective) and resuscitates characters overshadowed by the burden of false impression. Her aesthetic, whether shot in black and white or color, is cinematic. Her portraits carry personal and collective strengths forward and create lasting impressions."" — Ryan Rice/ Curator
Your Contribution Makes a Positive Impact - A new camera means I can continue to highlight, promote and showcase the diverse cultures of First Nations people, communities, groups and organizations. The images I've photographed over the past 6 yrs have been licensed for use in educational textbooks, university publications, documentaries for CBC, CTV, and other mainstream news. My work also positively affects First Nations youth in communities across Canada through outreach workshops in schools and community centres. By donating you will be contributing to the creation of art and photography that empowers First Nations people across Canada and the United States, which has far-reaching impact on audiences not only in the Americas but also abroad.

Nadya Kwandibens is Ojibwe (Anishinaabe) and French from the Northwest Angle #37 First Nation in Ontario, Canada. She is a self-taught, dynamic photographer specializing in artistic natural light portraiture and event photography.
In 2000 Nadya began exploring photography and while working in video/ radio production, she has gathered the professional experience to easily connect with people and groups.

<p><br/></p><p><b>27 May</b></p><p>Hello everyone!<br/>We've been off-line for a while and now we are again here! Our campaign ended a few days ago.<br/><br/>Campaign was not as successful as we would like, mainly because it was perceived rather than a shop, not as an opportunity to support the idea, and of course, because we are unfortunately are not yet able to show the perfect stabilization, as in the competing models that have been developed and improved over the years. However, even the collected funds are enough to continue system development and make new improved prototypes and prepare manufacturing. We have already ordered and received a lot of new parts needed for the development. We are significantly improving SERVOSTAB prototype - equip it with new mechanics, metal housing, a new gyroscope and more accurate magnetic encoder. We'll post news about our new prototype as soon as we get some results. And of course we'll make all possible to send out perks, but time limits may be shifted because campaign goal was not reached.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p><b>25 March</b></p>
<p>We receive a lot of feedback. We will reply to everyone, but that may take a bit of time.</p>

It also will be tuned better and some FW enhancements will be made. We also plan to use better magnetic encoder with higher angular resolution (16 bits instead of current 12 bits, which means 16 times more accurate).

<h4>What is SERVOSTAB?</h4>
<p>It is a motor designed to stabilize a video camera. The output shaft of the motor remains stationary, while the motor body is moving, thus the direction of the camera attached to the output shaft is not changing. SERVOSTAB stabilizes one rotation axis, however, by using two or three units two or three rotation axes may be stabilized, thereby achieving complete camera stabilization.

</p><p>SERVOSTAB is made in the format of standard servo motor with size about 4x4x2 cm, which allows the use of existing camera mounts for multi axis stabilization systems and even upgrading already existing systems.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/505626/files/20140413135243-servo2.png?1397422363"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h4>How stabilization works?</h4>
<p>SERVOSTAB has built-in gyroscope which detects any rotation. Gyroscope data are being processed by microcontroller and the motor is driven to compensate external rotation. SERVOSTAB works in two different modes. The first mode is full camera stabilization. The second mode is follow stabilization, when only too fast movements and shaking are stabilized while the camera smoothly follows the movements of the operator.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/453965/files/20140323103853-follow.png?1395596333"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h4>How powerful is SERVOSTAB?</h4>
<p>SERVOSTAB is really powerful. It can stabilize most of DSLR cameras and does not require precise  camera balancing.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/453540/files/20140323070416-unbalanced.png?1395583456"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h4>What is required  by SERVOSTAB to work?</h4>
<p>SERVOSTAB is extremely autonomous and can work without any external devices. Just connect 4.5-8.4V voltage supply and that's all! SERVOSTAB allows direct connection to 7.4V (2S) lithium battery without any converters.

</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/453933/files/20140323101822-battery.png?1395595102"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h4>How can I control the direction of the camera?</h4>
<p>SERVOSTAB allows control of camera rotation. All rotation control is applied on top of stabilization, as if we control the conventional non-moving servo. SERVOSTAB uses standard servo connector and PWM signal as input. It can be connected to any existing servo controller like RC radio receiver, servo driver, arduino and others. Input signal can be interpreted in several ways selected by user with very flexible configuration, ranging from smooth panning, and ending in a quick and precise positioning.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/453522/files/20140323070252-connect_to.png?1395583372"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h4>Are there any limits in rotation?</h4>
<p>No. SERVOSTAB allows 360° rotation and unlimited number of turns. Software angle limits can be set by the user to protect the camera and the mount from damages. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/453529/files/20140323070325-limits.png?1395583405"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h4>How can I configure SERVOSTAB?</h4>
<p>Connect SERVOSTAB to your computer using USB and supplied adapter and run our utility. It allows configuration of many parameters and even giving a name to each device so they don't get mixed up in multiple axis mounts. It also allows you to update SERVOSTAB firmware so new features may appear in future.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/453942/files/20140323102138-utility.png?1395595298"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h4>Any other features?</h4>
<p>Lots of them!</p>
<p>For example, the default servo output shaft position is user-settable. You can change it at any time without even touching the motor - no need in unscrewing  anything. More to that you can setup servo behavior at power-on, whether it will start stabilizing from current position or it will slowly move to default position. Using camera mounts with gears or belts is also not a problem - just setup scaling factor of gear and select whether the output shaft direction should be reversed. </p>
<p>Unlike other servo motors SERVOSTAB has the full color indication LED on back side. Each color has its meaning, though the LED can be deactivated to prevent unwanted flares.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/453528/files/20140323070319-led.png?1395583399"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>There are also features that the user won't usually see, but they are still very important, such as overheating protection, camera mount jamming protection, wrong connection protection and others. </p>
<p>We also have a lot of ideas to be implemented, which will become available with firmware updates for all users in future. Among them are RS-232 advanced external control, horizon tracking system (using accelerometer already built-in), the possibility to stabilize the servo motor body itself but not the output shaft and more.</p>
<p>We pay great attention to the ease of use, so you do not have to worry about calibrating the gyroscope, playing with numbers (like tuning PID coefficients), fine balancing, etc. Just plug in SERVOSTAB, select modes you want to use and you are ready to go!</p>
<br/><br/><h2>What makes SERVOSTAB the best stabilization solution?</h2>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<b>Compact size:</b> no external controllers/sensors/wires/etc. Apply power and that's all. One more wire if external control is needed.</li>
<li>
<b>Huge torque:</b> while having small size SERVOSTAB produces really huge torque for heavy camera stabilization and even capable of driving seriously unbalanced systems: no need for precise balancing.</li>
<li>
<b>Standard dimensions and connection:</b> fully compatible with existing camera mounts and servo controllers: replace and go!</li>
<li>
<b>Ease of use:</b> no need in fine tuning.</li>
<li>
<b>Power efficiency:</b> consumes nearly zero power when not moving (in balanced systems).</li>
</ul><p></p>
<br/><br/><h2>How is it made?</h2>
<p>To make all features possible some modern technologies were used:</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Question</h2>
<br/><h3>General</h3>
<p>
<b>Does the servo function adequately if it is mounted horizontally? Can it stabilize pan/yaw/roll axis?</b><br/>
Yes. Servo orientation does not matter, it will work properly in any orientation due to use of gyroscope, not accelerometer. Though SERVOSTAB also has accelerometer built-in (in fact IMU) and we plan to add horizon tracking system in future FW updates. Of course such system will work only for servo horizontal axis orientation.
</p>
<p>
<b>Does the servo comes with the PC software and USB adapter? </b><br/>
Yes. USB adapter comes with each SERVOSTAB. You may also use third-party RS232-USB adapters. Software will be freely available for downloading at our website.
</p>
<p>
<b>Do you need beta-testers?</b><br/>
Probably yes. If you want to become a beta-tester, please send an email with subject ""Beta-testing"" to support@servostab.com. We will contact you once we will start beta testing.
</p>
<p>
<b>What's the expected cost once you bring it to market?</b><br/>
We expect the final price to be in 100$-150$ range. It depends on many factors, such as the final prototype materials cost, the success of this campaign, the mass production costs and others.
</p>
<br/><h3>Technical specs</h3>
<p>
<b>Does SERVOSTAB supports geared/belt gimbals?</b><br/>
Yes, it does. There is a ""scale"" field in our setup utility, which scales the output shaft angle by some factor.
For example if your gimbal gear/belt reduction has ratio 1:10, you just need to enter 10.000 scale factor and probably select ""reverse"" option if you use one gear pair. That's all. After that you can setup SERVOSTAB like there is no gear, for example you can set up an angle limits in degrees (or using interactive mode, by turning servo output shaft in released mode).<br/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/481558/files/20140403114111-1533857_223251167869892_1011499976_n.png?1396550471"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>
<b>What is the torque of SERVOSTAB?</b><br/>
Current prototype has torque about 12 kg*cm@7.4V. We expect it to be something around that in mass production version.
</p>
<p>
<b>What is the frequency of the sensing/adjustment that is taking place?</b><br/>
The gyroscope is sampled at 1000 Hz, the magnetic encoder at 4000 Hz and the motor PWM level is updated at 4000 Hz (each 5th PWM pulse).
</p>
<p>
<b>Does SERVOSTAB require PID tuning?</b><br/>
Our current tests show high stability with different loads without additional tuning. In the final version we expect either no PID tuning by the user or very simplified tuning like setting one of the presets. 
</p>
<br/><h3>Contributions and perks</h3>
<p>
<b>What happens to perks if goal is not reached?</b><br/>
We will continue to work on the project in any case, but if the goal is not reached, time frames may be shifted. We appreciate your participation and will do everything to send out perks.
</p>
<p>
<b>Can I grab one perk more than once?</b><br/>
Yes. To do that you should contribute a few times, each time selecting the perk.

27 MayHello everyone!We've been off-line for a while and now we are again here! Our campaign ended a few days ago.Campaign was not as successful as we would like, mainly because it was perceived rather than a shop, not as an opportunity to support the idea, and of course, because we are unfortunately are not yet able to show the perfect stabilization, as in the competing models that have been developed and improved over the years. However, even the collected funds are enough to continue system development and make new improved prototypes and prepare manufacturing. We have already ordered and received a lot of new parts needed for the development. We are significantly improving SERVOSTAB prototype - equip it with new mechanics, metal housing, a new gyroscope and more accurate magnetic encoder. We'll post news about our new prototype as soon as we get some results. And of course we'll make all possible to send out perks, but time limits may be shifted because campaign goal was not reached.25 March
We receive a lot of feedback. We will reply to everyone, but that may take a bit of time.
We will also post some updates shortly, stay tuned!

Good news! Now you can get a SERVOSTAB for free! Click here to learn more.
Sample video. We are receiving many requests for an example of stabilized video footage from a camera. So we have made a short video demonstrating the stabilization.
Please notice! We used an early version prototype in this video. Final version we are currently developing has completely different (and better) mechanics. It also will be tuned better and some FW enhancements will be made. We also plan to use better magnetic encoder with higher angular resolution (16 bits instead of current 12 bits, which means 16 times more accurate). Some  info about the video:SERVOSTAB EARLY prototype stabilization testCamera: Canon 600D (Rebel T3i/Kiss X5)Lens: Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS IITotal weight: 775 grams / 27.3 ozFocal lengths: 18mm (crop 1.6)Mount: highly unbalanced one axis mount

EARLY BIRD 2 perk now avaiable! Get SERVOSTAB for only 109$
14 April
SERVOSTAB goes metal!
Meet metal SERVOSTAB! Now it's fully made of aluminum without any plastic parts, which gives real rigidity to servo motor. Precision CNC machined case allows reaching zero backlash in gear system.
We are now waiting for new PCB's, gyroscopes and encoders with enhanced characteristics to build SERVOSTAB final prototype.



What is SERVOSTAB?
It is a motor designed to stabilize a video camera. The output shaft of the motor remains stationary, while the motor body is moving, thus the direction of the camera attached to the output shaft is not changing. SERVOSTAB stabilizes one rotation axis, however, by using two or three units two or three rotation axes may be stabilized, thereby achieving complete camera stabilization.

SERVOSTAB is made in the format of standard servo motor with size about 4x4x2 cm, which allows the use of existing camera mounts for multi axis stabilization systems and even upgrading already existing systems.

How stabilization works?
SERVOSTAB has built-in gyroscope which detects any rotation. Gyroscope data are being processed by microcontroller and the motor is driven to compensate external rotation. SERVOSTAB works in two different modes. The first mode is full camera stabilization. The second mode is follow stabilization, when only too fast movements and shaking are stabilized while the camera smoothly follows the movements of the operator.

How powerful is SERVOSTAB?
SERVOSTAB is really powerful. It can stabilize most of DSLR cameras and does not require precise  camera balancing.

What is required  by SERVOSTAB to work?
SERVOSTAB is extremely autonomous and can work without any external devices. Just connect 4.5-8.4V voltage supply and that's all! SERVOSTAB allows direct connection to 7.4V (2S) lithium battery without any converters.


How can I control the direction of the camera?
SERVOSTAB allows control of camera rotation. All rotation control is applied on top of stabilization, as if we control the conventional non-moving servo. SERVOSTAB uses standard servo connector and PWM signal as input. It can be connected to any existing servo controller like RC radio receiver, servo driver, arduino and others. Input signal can be interpreted in several ways selected by user with very flexible configuration, ranging from smooth panning, and ending in a quick and precise positioning.

Are there any limits in rotation?
No. SERVOSTAB allows 360° rotation and unlimited number of turns. Software angle limits can be set by the user to protect the camera and the mount from damages. 

How can I configure SERVOSTAB?
Connect SERVOSTAB to your computer using USB and supplied adapter and run our utility. It allows configuration of many parameters and even giving a name to each device so they don't get mixed up in multiple axis mounts. It also allows you to update SERVOSTAB firmware so new features may appear in future.

Any other features?
Lots of them!
For example, the default servo output shaft position is user-settable. You can change it at any time without even touching the motor - no need in unscrewing  anything. More to that you can setup servo behavior at power-on, whether it will start stabilizing from current position or it will slowly move to default position. Using camera mounts with gears or belts is also not a problem - just setup scaling factor of gear and select whether the output shaft direction should be reversed. 
Unlike other servo motors SERVOSTAB has the full color indication LED on back side. Each color has its meaning, though the LED can be deactivated to prevent unwanted flares.

There are also features that the user won't usually see, but they are still very important, such as overheating protection, camera mount jamming protection, wrong connection protection and others. 
We also have a lot of ideas to be implemented, which will become available with firmware updates for all users in future. Among them are RS-232 advanced external control, horizon tracking system (using accelerometer already built-in), the possibility to stabilize the servo motor body itself but not the output shaft and more.
We pay great attention to the ease of use, so you do not have to worry about calibrating the gyroscope, playing with numbers (like tuning PID coefficients), fine balancing, etc. Just plug in SERVOSTAB, select modes you want to use and you are ready to go!
What makes SERVOSTAB the best stabilization solution?



Compact size: no external controllers/sensors/wires/etc. Apply power and that's all. One more wire if external control is needed.

Huge torque: while having small size SERVOSTAB produces really huge torque for heavy camera stabilization and even capable of driving seriously unbalanced systems: no need for precise balancing.

Standard dimensions and connection: fully compatible with existing camera mounts and servo controllers: replace and go!

Ease of use: no need in fine tuning.

Power efficiency: consumes nearly zero power when not moving (in balanced systems).

How is it made?
To make all features possible some modern technologies were used:




Microcontroller is the brain of SERVOSTAB. We use powerful STM32 microcontroller with ARM Cortex-M4 core running at 72 MHz. All this power is used for complex mathematical algorithms that control position and stabilization about 4000 times per second.








MEMS gyroscope is built-in SERVOSTAB and allows to obtain the angle of rotation. Having dimensions of only 4x4x1 mm it contains complex constantly moving mechanical parts inside. Powerful mathematics is used to process gyroscope data and get precise rotation angle with nearly zero drift over time.








Magnetic encoder is used as output shaft position sensor. Unlike ordinary potentiometers used in regular servos, magnetic encoder is contactless sensor, thus it will never wear out. More to that it allows 360° rotation and even multiple turns. Also magnetic encoder provides really high accuracy of 0.088°.








Coreless motor unlike conventional motor which has a heavy rotor comprises a light rotor which can start, stop and change direction very fast. That is very important for stabilization accuracy and smoothness. Moreover coreless motor has high power that allows stabilizing heavy cameras.








Metal gears and dual ball bearing ensure high reliability and good mechanical characteristics of the servo motor. Large torque allows stabilization of heavy cameras and poorly balanced systems. Near zero backlash increases stabilization smoothness.








Full metal housing provides high durability, reliability and good heat dissipation needed for such powerful device as SERVOSTAB. Although the current prototype is partly plastic, we plan the final version to be fully made of metal.

We started SERVOSTAB project in early 2013. During past year we have tested a lot of concepts, developed several prototypes, solved dozens of technical challenges.

We finally developed all the electronics for SERVOSTAB. It consists of two small PCB's, having sizes of only 35x16mm and 10x15mm.

These two boards are tightly placed inside SERVOSTAB, one above another. Maintaining small size we managed to place all the components on these boards, see how it looks like assembled:

Finally we assembeled it all together:

To launch our new, nonprofit 501(c)3 foundation, we seek the
generous support of Indiegogo backers for the foundation’s initial, ambitious
undertaking: 
The Disappearing America Project.
Just as vintage, historic photographs are national treasures,
we believe that a sweeping photographic study of old, endangered, and fast-vanishing
places, enriched by evocative video stories, will become priceless national
resources, preserved for unending generations at America’s oldest federal
cultural institution: the nation’s amazing Library of Congress.

Old General Store in Alabama by Carol M. Highsmith
BACKGROUND


For 33 years, renowned American photographer Carol M.
Highsmith has crisscrossed the nation, producing a vast visual record of our
times. She has donated more than 25,000 images, copyright-free, to the world
via our treasured Library of Congress.  There, they stand among the
Library’s top six featured collections, alongside the work of Mathew Brady,
Dorothea Lange, and others.  
Highsmith is the only living photographer so honored.
Now, Highsmith and distinguished videographer Connie Doebele,
a longtime producer of some of C-SPAN’s most important and compelling programs,
have founded the This is America! Foundation to support the creation of a
definitive visual study of early 21st-Century America.
No such effort has even been attempted since photographers
fanned out across the nation to document the ravages of the Great Depression 75
years ago.
And the foundation’s first expedition, for which we enlist
the help of Indiegogo backers, will focus on “Disappearing America.”

WHAT’S “DISAPPEARING AMERICA”?
No doubt you’ve seen the toll of merciless time and changing
tastes across our land: Sagging barns. 
Abandoned gas stations.  Drive-in
movie theaters reduced to junkyards. 
Shabby trailer courts and family-owned motels, cluttered general stores,
and butcher shops with sawdust on the floor barely hanging on.  Like quirky snake farms and giant dinosaurs
and freaky museums, all were once everyday staples of American life.
Fewer and fewer of these vestiges of simpler days are being
rescued or restored.  Many old places disappear
from the landscape as corporate farming supplants family farms, interstate
highways draw traffic away from the old, two-lane roads, and sprawling
subdivisions and shopping malls spread into rural dales.

VISUAL PRESERVATION
People snap photographs of these endangered landmarks all the
time on cellphones, inexpensive still and video cameras, and occasionally on
fine equipment to produce images for exhibit or sale.  Most of these images are here today and
forgotten tomorrow.
But Highsmith’s photographs of old places, and Doebele’s
stories about men and women who created round barns and teapot-shaped diners and
dancing neon signs will survive for untold generations to come, protected, preserved,
and made available to everyone, everywhere without copyright restriction at the
place we call “America’s Memory.” 

Big Tex (before he burned to a crisp) at the Texas State Fair by Carol M. Highsmith 
Thanks to their incomparable preservation specialists and
facilities, Library of Congress curators tell us there’ll be “no end date” to our
Disappearing America images and videos that depict a nation in the thrall of
change -- even as today’s digital
format, like yesterday’s celluloid film, becomes outdated. 
Indiegogo funders can help make the historic Disappearing America
Project a rousing template for other This is America! Foundation expeditions to
follow.  And by underwriting this
project, you’ll be supporting the everlasting preservation mission of the Library
of Congress: the greatest body of knowledge and creativity on earth.

We believe in crowdfunding and we are super-excited to join Indiegogo after 3 successful projects on Kickstarter.Why do we like crowdfunding platforms, such as Indiegogo, so much? Simply because this is the best, largest and most professional focus group in the world! Your knowledge is invaluable and what's really cool is that people are happy to share their knowledge and experience - to help developers like us bring to market products that might not have been developed using the traditional way.These are just some of the reasons we're here for our fourth crowdfunding project.Three years ago, we introduced on Kickstarter the miggo ""Strap&Wrap"" -  the world's first camera strap that morphs into a compact protective carrier. The campaign raised 400% above target and our young company received a huge infusion of energy to continue developing innovative products.  Two years ago we were back again with agua holsters - an IPX3 storm-proof quick-draw camera holster - this time we raised 800% of what we asked for, with only 2000 amazing backers. It gave us a lot of confidence and resources to continue.  Last year we introduced Pictar – our revolutionary iPhone camera grip that gives to mobile-photography lovers the ability to truly unleash the power of their iPhone camera and take their photography to a completely new level. Pictar is now sold worldwide -thanks to our amazing backers!  And now, we are truly excited to join Indiegogo with our new line of agua bags, offering for the first time a game-changing product not only for photographers but also for the emerging and exciting area of drone photography. Please support our project. Thank YOU!Team miggo at video shooting dayProject's Time-Line:Risks and challenges.We have invested tons of effort in order to make sure we will be able to deliver the agua bags on time but, Murphy is always on the lookout and many unexpected things can happen . The factory we selected has decades of experience in producing highly technical bags and cases and we have made prepared many samples and carefully selected material suppliers and shipping companies.

<h2><strong>I am not sure about robots? Why do I need a robot?</strong></h2>
<h3><strong><em>""If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses."" - Henry Ford</em></strong></h3>
<p>Do you still go to the Horse dealer to buy a new horse? Living in the 21st Century, technology has taken us leaps and bounds. Faster, more efficient technologies help us save a lot of time, provide better security and STAY out of our way. Applications are getting smaller, faster and more sophisticated by the day. We need to adopt them to stay ahead of competition and give ourselves more time for other better things in life. If you're still confused about robots then ask yourself this: Do you have time to do everything yourself? Do you worry about security for personal property and family? Are you still spending 10s,100s or 1000s of dollars every year for tasks that you could do for much cheaper?</p>
<h2><strong>Who made the Dragonfly Robot?</strong></h2>
<p>The research behind the dragonfly began with a $1,000,000 grant from the US Air Force. The dragonfly has been developed at the Georgia Institute of Technology, as a joint effort between 20+ researchers, PhDs, professors and students from multiple universities across the world.</p>
<h2><strong>Why a ""Dragonfly"" robot?</strong></h2>
<p>Dragonflies can perform aggressive feats of flight; flying forwards, backwards and achieving speeds in excess of 35mph. They're the top of their food chain in the insect world and the fiercest predators in the sky.</p>
<p>Our work mimics the actual insect in flight, with four independently flapping wings. Significant research has gone into blending biology and robotics together. At insect scale, airplanes and helicopters are no longer efficient while flapping wings excel. This not only gives the Robot Dragonfly a great boost in performance, but also makes it look really cool!</p>
<p>We’ve ALL seen Helicopters, we’ve ALL seen Quadcopters and Airplanes but really… ALL of them are BULKY, Low-on-Battery and really just a “one Trick Pony!” The TechJect Dragonfly is really in a league of its own! It hovers like the best helicopters and quadrotors. It flies like the best of airplanes. It’s all these different flyers combined! </p>
<p>We make the Dragonfly smaller and smaller with each iteration, while enhancing its insect-like performance! Something physics does not allow for all the other flying systems; giving us the edge.</p>

What is the TechJect Dragonfly?
 
The TechJect Dragonfly is a wifi-enabled, super-small, smart and energy efficient robotic insect; it can do amazing aerial photography, aerobatic maneuvers for gaming, autonomous patrolling for security and surveillance, and much more. With up to 20 sensors onboard, the Dragonfly is the most advanced and compact flying platform out there.
You can control the robot insect using your iPhone, Android Smartphone or computer and make it do complex tasks including home security, neighborhood watch, advanced gaming and more; you can do this in person or remotely. The Dragonfly sports the smallest and most comprehensive autopilots on the market, with video cameras, GPS, gyroscopes and more.




What can I do with a robotic flying insect?
The Dragonfly can be used for any task requiring live and mobile video feed; such as photography, home/workplace security, swarm robotics, advanced gaming and spying! And it does it with style with 5 technology patents delivering the extended performance improvement over other systems in the market. With up to 20 environmental sensors, cameras and GPS capabilities, it can be developed to track athletes & outdoor events, or integrated with an App as a fun way to retrace a day of skiing, hiking or whatever you like.

If you think our soldiers aren't safe enough, give one to each and see how their surrounding awareness improves (like a guard dog watching out for his master). Walking alone at night? Keep a third eye looking out for you all the way back to your home.

perks will be delivered or deemed satisfactory. The nature of crowdfunding is
such that campaigns on Indiegogo are raising funds for work-in-progress
projects, ideas, or causes. Contributing to a campaign and claiming a perk on
Indiegogo is not the same as buying something online.

Because projects may still be in their early stages, many things can
happen between the time the project is raising funds and the expected project
release date. While your contribution brings the campaign idea closer to
becoming reality, there’s always the chance that a project may end up falling
through, and the campaign owner may not be able to offer their contributors the
perks they’d originally promised.
That said, campaign owners are still held by our Terms of Use to fulfill perks. If for any reason they’re unable to offer you the perk you
claimed, campaign owners are obligated to reach out to their contributors and
work out a mutually satisfactory resolution- this resolution could be an
alternative perk, a promise to issue the promised perk at a later date if the
campaign owner is able to raise additional funds, or a refund.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My name is Jessica Hess, and I go by JNH Photography. I love photography, and it's a HUGE part of my life. I always struggled to produce a quality in my work that I was happy with, because I've never had the funds to back up my ideas or to fund my equipment. Last year, when we received tax returns my mother was generous enough to loan me money to buy a used Nikon D2X. It's the first and only real professional camera I've ever owned. because it's the first time I found such a great deal as well as had some way to make the purchase. </p>
<p>Recently, my camera fell just three feet and will no longer turn on. I rely on this camera to not only capture memories with my son, but I also use it as a source of income. My boyfriend and I have recently lost our jobs, and we're currently in a financial hardship. I have $0 to my name, and therefor have absolutely no way to have my camera repaired or even so much as looked at. This camera means more to me than I could ever fully express, it's something I wanted for so many years, and all of my hard work is gone if I can't continue to make my art! It's my livelihood, and photography is my escape from the world and it's hardships. If I can't get this camera fixed, I fear I'll have to give up photography entirely.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need just $500 to get my camera repaired. I'm not asking for a new camera, or even enough to get a better lens once it's fixed, I only want my camera fixed and working again. It means a great deal to me that I do this, for I've never cared so much about any other material object in my entire life.</p>
<p>Everyone who donates will be donating to a good cause, and I appreciate every single penny anyone can help me with. Even donating just $1 puts me that much closer to my goal of having the one object of value returned to me.</p>
<p>I also want to point out that everyone who donates will be rewarded in some way. I know I can't afford to offer much, but I still hope I can make the perks worth it for you guys.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>You can really help me by spreading the word around, and using the share tools to show this campaign to your friends. The more people that see it, the more likely I can get my camera fixed and continue doing the one thing that makes me truly happy.</p>
<p>I thank you all for taking the time to read this.</p>

<p>Hello my dear family and friends.  This is a bit awkward, but I need some help.  As you all know I am not very go at asking for help and would usually rather ram my head into a wall repeatedly before admitting I can't do something.  This, however, is different.<br/><br/></p>
<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>As many of you know Nick and I have orders to Hawaii in the spring.  I have convinced myself that this is my big break and that once we get there my photography business is going to take wing and soar into the aether without looking back.  So what's the big deal?  Am I just doing this to brag? NO! <br/><br/>Here's were I need the help.  I need a better camera to be able to take pictures of my amazingly awesome customers.  While the shiny, new cameras will always make me go ""ohhh!  ahhh!""  I am, alas, practical if nothing else.  I have found an amazing deal on a used ""so 2 seasons ago"" camera.  A Canon EOS 7D SLR, to be exact. <br/><br/>So here's where you come in.  I can not afford this on my own.  While the thought of saying ""Damn the torpedoes! Full speed ahead!"" and rushing head long into debt and a subsequent divorce (or at least a well deserved beating) is very tempting, I thought I would try something different and ask for help.  If all of you would be so kind as to donate $20, that will bring me leaps and bounds closer to my dream!<br/><br/> Call a Christmas gift, a birthday gift, a donaton or what have you.  I can't do this without your help.  Please give what you can and share with friends and family who may wish to give too.  <br/><br/>Thank you all for your help, support and understanding.  This last year has been a rough start and I know it's not over yet, but more than worth it.  Thank you for helping me make my dream come true.  None of this would be possible with you  all!<br/><br/>Best Wishes,<br/>Amy</p>

<p>I am very close to finishing my screenplay! Having a laptop would be immensely helpful, allowing me to get OUT of the house, and out of the city to work - a much more conducive environment. If I sell it, part of the funds would go helping the gifted Tatiana Mariott to follow her dream with tuition to study fashion/costume design.</p>
<p>On a personal level, my equipment was stolen soon after I made the decision to stop operating in invisible mode. It took courage on my part to not slide back into invisible mode, but to put this fundraiser online. But I believe it’s part of my process in allowing myself to be seen in the world. And thus, you would also be helping me to better support myself and those I love.</p>
<p>I would also like to utilize my skills in services such as  natural habitat restoration and land conservation, and the preservation of the knowledge of native peoples. I am especially drawn to learn and preserve the plant knowledge of the Amazonian and Native North America cultures.</p>
<h3><strong>Funding Details</strong></h3>
<p>After more research, I realized it would be wiser to go for the funds to purchase the new camera (500e. more), along with one new lens. The camera has important innovations over it’s predecessor, and both the camera and lens are less costly and MUCH lighter and smaller then the alternatives - with me being in the lightweight division, weighing in at 47.3 kilos,  this matters.</p>
<p><strong>Used:  </strong>15”Apple i7 laptop, at least 4G. ram, 500k. or 1g. video memory for editing. <strong>1,500 euro</strong></p>
<p><strong>New:  </strong>Panasonic Lumix GH3 photo/HD video camera  <strong>1,025 euro</strong></p>
<p>Panasonic GX Vario lens, 30-100mm(70-200) 2.8, power OIS, <strong>1,150euro</strong></p>
<p><strong>1500+1025+1150=3,675+147(indigogo fee)=<strong>3,822</strong></strong></p>
<p>With<strong> 4732e. funds raised,</strong> I could add a second important lens:</p>
<p>Panasonic Lumix GX Vario lense, 12-35mm(28-70mm)/2.8 lens(pkg.w.camera)  <strong>1,900e </strong></p>
<p><strong>1500+1900+1150= 4550+182(fee)=<strong>4732</strong></strong></p>
<h3><strong>Additional Ways You Can Help</strong></h3>
<p>Another way to support would be to pass this along and ask a friend or family member to consider donating. Most people are glad to help if they know it’s going to a good cause…you could tell them the are supporting the arts.</p>
<p>Using the Indiegogo ""share tools"" is huge and it's also easy to send an email or re-post on facebook. This would be a huge help!</p>

Some of you also know me by my first name, Nancy. I am an artist and my medium is photography. I have been creating work for over 20 years. Recently I have been expanding into motion picture, and working on a screenplay.
I am asking for your help in replacing my equipment, which was stolen my from home: my computer, camera, lenses, memory cards and batteries. These are not only my work tools, they are a way for me to experience and express my impressions of the world and my life.




Five times my work has been selected by jury in the annual competition, American Photography and published in their beautiful coffee table book. The last time there were over 12,000 entries and just over 300 were selected. I was a runner-up and received an Honorable Mention in the National Geographic International Photo Competition. My work has been exhibited and purchased numerous times; and I have received other awards and accolades.

<p><b>I am not really a tech person, is it hard to set up Furbo at home by myself?</b><br/></p>
<p>No need to worry! Setting up your Furbo is a cinch! Setup is only three simple steps away: <br/>1. Plug in each end of the USB cable into the Furbo device and the adaptor. <br/>2. Download the Furbo app through the App Store/Google Play. <br/>3. Open the Furbo app and follow the on-screen instructions to complete setup.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Can I use Furbo with my cat?</b><br/></p>
<p>You can absolutely use Furbo with your cat. In fact, our office kitty loves it! You may put cat treats inside Furbo for your cat as long as the size of the treats fit into Furbo’s treat dispenser!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Where should I place Furbo?</b><br/></p>
<p>Good question! Depending on where your dog usually wanders, you can place Furbo anywhere at home away from direct sunlight and moisture. We recommend placing Furbo 12 to 20 inches above the floor, or based on your dog's height. You will find a set of three fixed 3M double-sided tape mounted on the bottom of your Furbo unit to aid with stabilization. . <br/><br/>If you own a tripod, you can also use the tripod mounting sockets on the bottom of Furbo to attach it to your tripod.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Is Furbo's camera angle wide enough to see what my dog is doing throughout the day?</b><br/></p>
<p>Sure thing! Furbo has a 120° wide-angle camera with a built-in microphone and speaker. To get your dog to come towards the camera just use the Furbo app to toss him treats and speak through the microphone.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Can I use my own treats with Furbo?</b><br/></p>
<p>Yes, certainly! We understand all puppies have different preferences for treats. It is no problem as long as the size of those treats is smaller than the treat dispensing hole on Furbo. (Round shaped treats with a diameter <br/> around 1 cm (.4"") work best.)<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Can my family members and I connect to Furbo at the same time?</b><br/></p>
<p>Yes, you can! Furbo is user friendly for family members, but to protect your privacy, one Furbo will correspond to one email account and password. If there are multiple users, we recommend sharing a family account and password. <br/><br/>P.S. Please note that Furbo can only have two people connected at the same time.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Can I share the pictures or videos captured by Furbo onto my social media accounts?</b><br/></p>
<p>Yes, sure thing! In addition to saving pictures and videos taken from Furbo to your phone, you can also share them on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, email, and more!<br/></p>
<p><b><br/></b></p>
<p><b>How do I clean Furbo?</b><br/></p>
<p>Cleaning Furbo is an easy task! For your convenience, you will only need a damp cloth to wipe and clean Furbo.<br/><br/>As Furbo contains sensitive electronics, do not rinse Furbo under running water.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Does Furbo need batteries?</b><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>No batteries are needed for Furbo! Furbo uses USB cable and standard power adapter to plug into the wall. This way you can always stay connected with your furry loved ones. </p>
<p>P.S. Furbo’s power adapter plug supports 110v and 220v, meaning it is compatible with power outlets in every country around the world with just a socket converter.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What is the minimum WiFi upload speed needed for Furbo to transmit data smoothly?</b><br/></p>
<p>We recommend the WiFi upload speed to be at least 0.8 Mbps (0.1 MB/s) to maintain the best video streaming quality.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>What does each of the colored lights mean?</b><br/></p>
<p>Each light has its own meaning as listed below:<br/><br/>- White light: Furbo is starting up<br/>- Green light: Furbo is ready for setup<br/>- Purple light: No Wi-Fi connection <br/>- Yellow light: Furbo is in Standby mode<br/>- Blue light: Furbo is in use! <br/> <br/>P.S. Dogs can see the color yellow and blue, which means your furry best friend can tell whether you are using Furbo or not when he or she sees the light on Furbo!<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Why did you design Furbo to toss treats?</b><br/></p>
<p>Furbo allows dogs to joyfully catch and fetch treats as if you are right there playing with them. The tossing feature is perfectly designed to entice your dog to enter the camera’s field of view so that you can wach your dog through Furbo’s app.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>My dog barks all the time, does that mean I will keep receiving barking alerts from Furbo?</b><br/></p>
<p>If your dog is barking too often and you would like to avoid receiving repeat notifications, simply adjust Furbo's barking detection sensitivity through the Furbo app settings.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Does Furbo come with a warranty?</b><br/></p>
<p>Yes! Furbo comes with a one year free warranty starting from the date of shipping. Your Furbo warranty covers all defects in material and workmanship, except the following: </p>
<p>- Damage caused by accident, misuse, abuse, disassembly, unauthorized modification or neglect. <br/>- Damage caused by liquid contact.  <br/>- Damage resulting from failure to follow instructions contained in your instruction manual. <br/>- Damage resulting from the performance of repairs by someone not authorized by our company.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>If I have other questions, who should I contact?</b><br/></p>
<p>As a backer, we understand you may have questions and concerns for Furbo, and we are happy to help answer them!<br/><br/>We are currently receiving a lot of inquiries, but we make sure to try our best to respond to you as fast as possible! Please contact hello@furbo.co with any questions you might have.<br/></p>

</div></div>","The World's Best Pet Cam, Training Device & Treat Dispenser.After consulting with many professional dog trainers and researchers, we engineered Furbo to stimulate a dog's unique audible and optical receptors that trains your dog to know when Furbo is active.
For example, Furbo will light up in a cool blue hue that stimulates their optical receptors and also triggers a light audible clicking noise that is akin to a professional trainer’s clicking device.

It's fun, scientific, social & comforting.How will you use Furbo?Train your dog for good behavior, correct their bad behaviors, comfort them when you are away or simply have some fun sharing awesome (and cute!) photos and videos of them on social media...








The Media Loves Furbo!

Dogs do too, check out the TechCrunch Puppy Party!!!Ever Wonder What They're Up To When You're Away?

The smartphone app controlled interactive camera  lets you see, hear, talk, play & give treats to when your away.





Check up on them, ask them for a trick or just start shooting them treats to show you care.

 ​


Just make sure you press record, you don't know what you'll see!



Stay close to your furry loved ones...







No matter where you are!










Furbo is the all-in-one pet sitter for when you 're away.

See how these furry lil guys use Furbo...







Have fun with Furbo



These guys are about doing tricks and waiting for the treats!

Bailey likes to show off with Furbo. He probably needs his on YouTube channel...





Play and have fun with your dog while you're away!



It's trick time, let's have some fun with treats!
Using the Furbo app on your smart device, you can trigger Furbo to ‘pop’ treats remotely. 
The accompanying sounds, lights and speaker alert your dog that a delicious treat is on the way. 


Unlike other devices that silently drop a treat to the floor, Furbo pops the treat across the room to let you and your dog play fetch remotely. 

​

Designed to accompany a variety of treats and to be incredibly simple to use, you’ll instantly feel closer than ever to your dog while you’re away from home. 



Check in anywhere, anytime to see your furry loved one. 
Furbo provides real-time audio and video streaming (and recording) in crisp 720p HD over a super-wide 120° angle lens so no matter where you place Furbo in your home - you’ll be able to see your dog at all times!
 



Calm them while you're away and let them know everything is okay.


Verbally communicate with your dog.
Give them that extra sense of comfort when you’re away. 
Whether you want to call for them or calm them, hearing your voice when you’re away from home can make all the difference for some dogs!



See what they are up to across the room.
To get an even closer glimpse of your little puppy, you can simply stretch the screen on your smart device for a 4x zoomed-in view!



Worried about your dog when you’re working late? 
Furbo has a built-in infrared LED filter that lets you see an incredibly clear view despite low-light conditions.




Reinforce good habits or reprimand bad ones - as they happen.






Being away doesn’t mean you can’t be there when something upsets them.

Furbo’s built-in microphone senses barking and immediately sends an alert to your phone. 
To give you the most accurate alerts possible, Furbo is designed to calibrate the natural audio of your home environment in order to ignore background noise. 




Dogs in particular both see and hear in very specific wavelengths. 
After consulting with many professional dog trainers and researchers, we designed Furbo to be conducive to a dog’s natural environment. 
For example, when Furbo is ready to launch a treat, the popper will light up in a cool blue hue that stimulates the optical receptors in canines. 
It will also trigger a light audible clicking noise that is akin to a professional trainer’s clicking devices. This helps train your dog to know exactly when Furbo is active and you’re ready to interact remotely. 





Keep your pup happy and entertained while they're home alone so you can avoid the little headaches caused by separation and missing their best friend!




Who knows, go ahead an share...your dog could be the next viral internet sensation!


Using the Furbo app, you can instantly capture pictures and videos of your pups that can be saved directly to your smart device or shared through social networks.
Whether you want to capture one of many cute moments or capture the evidence of some bad dog behavior - you’ll never have to miss an important moment again.




As our global community of Furbo users continues to grow, you can easily share the cutest and most heartfelt moments in your dog's life with other animal lovers. 
Whether it’s on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, or another platform, Furbo will provide hours of hilarious, touching, and entertaining content for everyone to enjoy.




While Furbo is the best tech-companion on the market, you can rest assured knowing that we’ve taken your comfort into mind as well. 
With the touch of a button on the Furbo app, you can easily set Furbo to shut off as soon as you walk in the door or when your smart device is in close proximity to home. 




Using industrial-strength 3M adhesives, Furbo will stay grounded to whatever surface you place it on though most Furbo users prefer to place it on a counter-top surface or next to their home entertainment center. 

Whether you have a larger dog or a scrappy puppy, Furbo’s natural bamboo wooden cover sits perfectly flush at the top of Furbo to make sure your smart pup can’t get their paws on all the treats. 





​


















Furbo is ready to go and guaranteed to ship!


We've already beta tested over 1000 users and are ready for full-scale production. 
The Furbo App is already available as a free download on the App Store & Google Play so you can download it right now. As soon as your device arrives, you’ll be ready to go in minutes!

​




 




 Not only does Furbo work perfectly on your smart phone and tablet (iOS + Android) - it also works on your Apple Watch to make checking on your furry friend as easy and hassle-free as possible. 
With a flick on the wrist, you can pop your dog’s favorite treats at any time!









See what's under the hood!




















I am not really a tech person, is it hard to set up Furbo at home by myself?
No need to worry! Setting up your Furbo is a cinch! Setup is only three simple steps away: 1. Plug in each end of the USB cable into the Furbo device and the adaptor. 2. Download the Furbo app through the App Store/Google Play. 3. Open the Furbo app and follow the on-screen instructions to complete setup.

Can I use Furbo with my cat?
You can absolutely use Furbo with your cat. In fact, our office kitty loves it! You may put cat treats inside Furbo for your cat as long as the size of the treats fit into Furbo’s treat dispenser!

Where should I place Furbo?
Good question! Depending on where your dog usually wanders, you can place Furbo anywhere at home away from direct sunlight and moisture. We recommend placing Furbo 12 to 20 inches above the floor, or based on your dog's height. You will find a set of three fixed 3M double-sided tape mounted on the bottom of your Furbo unit to aid with stabilization. . If you own a tripod, you can also use the tripod mounting sockets on the bottom of Furbo to attach it to your tripod.

Is Furbo's camera angle wide enough to see what my dog is doing throughout the day?
Sure thing! Furbo has a 120° wide-angle camera with a built-in microphone and speaker. To get your dog to come towards the camera just use the Furbo app to toss him treats and speak through the microphone.

Can I use my own treats with Furbo?
Yes, certainly! We understand all puppies have different preferences for treats. It is no problem as long as the size of those treats is smaller than the treat dispensing hole on Furbo. (Round shaped treats with a diameter  around 1 cm (.4"") work best.)

Can my family members and I connect to Furbo at the same time?
Yes, you can! Furbo is user friendly for family members, but to protect your privacy, one Furbo will correspond to one email account and password. If there are multiple users, we recommend sharing a family account and password. P.S. Please note that Furbo can only have two people connected at the same time.

Can I share the pictures or videos captured by Furbo onto my social media accounts?
Yes, sure thing! In addition to saving pictures and videos taken from Furbo to your phone, you can also share them on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube, email, and more!

How do I clean Furbo?
Cleaning Furbo is an easy task! For your convenience, you will only need a damp cloth to wipe and clean Furbo.As Furbo contains sensitive electronics, do not rinse Furbo under running water.

Does Furbo need batteries?

No batteries are needed for Furbo! Furbo uses USB cable and standard power adapter to plug into the wall. This way you can always stay connected with your furry loved ones. 
P.S. Furbo’s power adapter plug supports 110v and 220v, meaning it is compatible with power outlets in every country around the world with just a socket converter.


What is the minimum WiFi upload speed needed for Furbo to transmit data smoothly?
We recommend the WiFi upload speed to be at least 0.8 Mbps (0.1 MB/s) to maintain the best video streaming quality.

What does each of the colored lights mean?
Each light has its own meaning as listed below:- White light: Furbo is starting up- Green light: Furbo is ready for setup- Purple light: No Wi-Fi connection - Yellow light: Furbo is in Standby mode- Blue light: Furbo is in use!  P.S. Dogs can see the color yellow and blue, which means your furry best friend can tell whether you are using Furbo or not when he or she sees the light on Furbo!

Why did you design Furbo to toss treats?
Furbo allows dogs to joyfully catch and fetch treats as if you are right there playing with them. The tossing feature is perfectly designed to entice your dog to enter the camera’s field of view so that you can wach your dog through Furbo’s app.

My dog barks all the time, does that mean I will keep receiving barking alerts from Furbo?
If your dog is barking too often and you would like to avoid receiving repeat notifications, simply adjust Furbo's barking detection sensitivity through the Furbo app settings.

Does Furbo come with a warranty?
Yes! Furbo comes with a one year free warranty starting from the date of shipping. Your Furbo warranty covers all defects in material and workmanship, except the following: 
- Damage caused by accident, misuse, abuse, disassembly, unauthorized modification or neglect. - Damage caused by liquid contact.  - Damage resulting from failure to follow instructions contained in your instruction manual. - Damage resulting from the performance of repairs by someone not authorized by our company.

<p> The inspiration for the Langly Field Jacket comes from one of the most iconic utilitarian designs of all time, the M-65 field jacket. Originally developed by the military to function in any climate, the M-65 keeps cool on hot days, warm on cold nights, and dry during monsoons. The four large pockets secure all your necessities within easy reach, while the jacket’s clean lines lend it a timeless quality that still influences contemporary style. Our jacket features multiple reinforced snap-flap pockets; an adjustable hood and cuffs; a wind and water-resistant shell; and only the finest hardware available. This garment shines in any weather you may encounter in the city — or on the road.</p>

<p>Starting from scratch, we engineered our own state of the art materials. Our proprietary weather-shield technology keeps moisture and wind outside the shell while still letting your body breathe, wicking away perspiration to keep you warm and dry. In addition, every seam on the jacket is fully tape-sealed, ensuring a completely weatherproof shell.</p>
<p>Mobility and comfort were also top priorities. Our raglan sleeve design offers unrestricted range of motion without bulk or bunching, retaining our ideal silhouette. Downpours will roll right off the adjustable wireframe hood; its pull-cord system lets you simply and accurately adjust the hood shape and size to your liking. In warmer weather, zippered vents under the arms make it easy to let off steam.</p>

<p>Tailored pockets cater specifically to personal devices and the modern globetrotter’s need to access them. Pass-through channels covertly route headphone or battery charger cables from the exterior to the interior upper pockets. We’ve also lined the pockets with an RFID-blocking material to keep your passport, credit cards, and travels documents secure. In photo configuration mode, the Langly Field Jacket features a tether system that can be attached inside the front pockets.

At the end of 2013, I shut my doors forever to start a new chapter in a new city. I sold almost everything I owned including all of my professional gear, downgraded to a Fuji X-series camera (which I fell in LOVE with) and moved my life to Seattle, Washington.<br/></p><p><b>On July 4th someone stole that camera. </b></p><p>The one I had just sold my gear for. </p><p>The only one I had left. </p><p>To add insult to injury,<b> this is the second time this has happened.</b> The first time came with a busted car window and about $30k worth of 5Ds and Canon L-glass jacked from my backseat the first few hours into a New York City visit. They also took an iMac and a few other expensive items. My track record with cameras is somewhat of a tragedy and I’m back to the part where I’m basically devastated.</p><p><b>So I want to try something that I wasn’t able to try the last time,</b> I'm asking you (my Instagram friends) to chip in individually to collectively buy me another camera. Of course, since I’m asking Instagram there will be mostly Instagram specific rewards but I would like to include some opportunities to get coffee or maybe go on an adventure. This is a good way for us to meet, not because you bought my time, but because I don’t know a better way to tell someone “thanks” than in person.</p><p>Regardless, I'm running this campaign a little different than traditional ones. </p><p>Here’s where my head’s at:</p><p><b>1) I'M ONLY ASKING MY FRIENDS.</b> I am not opening this up to a web-wide beg where I ask you all to share this with your friends and they ask them to share it when theirs. I’m begging only from my friends. There’s something cool about having access to a community of people who appreciate your stuff and, while the circumstances suck, using the platform that introduced you to say “Hey, can I have your help?"". Listen, it’s not YOUR fault that my camera was stolen, but you might be someone who is able to contribute to <b>undoing the whole “fault” thing in the first place. </b>That’s really bizarre and really amazing. </p><p><b>2) I WANT TO MAKE THIS LESS ABOUT THE REWARDS.</b> Honestly, I’m turning to the one group of people who might most care about something as silly as my Instagramming and I’m asking them to help if they feel like they appreciate it enough to do that. I want people to pitch in not because they want a “reward” but because they empathize and because they enjoy the tiny photos and hopefully interesting quotes they see coupled together on their phones from me every other day. I want to be super up front about this from the start: I’m absolutely putting effort into the rewards because I want to give you something for giving me something,<b> but I don’t want to hide the fact that I’m asking you to be generous. </b>The rewards are an incentive, of course, and I'm cool with that, but let’s be real: I’m stuck and I’m asking for your help in getting me un-stuck.</p><p><b>3) I REFUSE TO DRAG THIS THING OUT.</b> I’m making this campaign 10 days long because I cannot be ok with posting for 20, 40 or 60 days in an effort to talk people into buying something for me that they didn’t lose. I’d much rather you decide whether giving is something you feel good about, and if you do...you just go for it. <b>I’m asking for help from whoever can help, as soon as they are able to help and for as much as they can afford to help.</b> I literally want to hit my goal within 48 hours. If I don’t, I’ll have a few more days to post and plead. I'm going as big as I can for one week and then I'm out. Think we can do it?</p><p><b>4) I’M STARTING IT OUT AT $10.</b> Here’s the thing, I know how important money is. It’s the reason I can’t afford to drop another $2,000 on a new camera right now. Money matters in a lot of ways so I've decided that if someone can only afford to spare one dollar, I’d rather they keep it and use it where they need it. I’ve been torn between the whole “Let them give what they can” and “Don’t ask for cash from people who shouldn’t really be giving it” philosophies. After some thinking, I’ve decided to go with ""Option B"". This has nothing to do with not appreciating a dollar from a friend who is giving me what they're able, <b>and everything to do with opting to ask my friends who are in a better financial space to give more because it's easier for them.</b></p><p>------------------</p><p>Again, this is an odd place for me.<b> I feel lucky </b>to have a chance at seeing my camera replaced by people whom I’ve met through a medium that didn’t even exist 5 years ago,<b> and equally embarrassed</b> to be giving them the opportunity to do so. But I finally decided to do it after being encouraged by my real-life friends and when I realized that I would WANT to know if one of my favorite insta-friends had some misfortune and I could help undo that misfortune.</p><p>What I had: I had purchased the Fuji X-M1 when it was relatively new. I had that body, a couple mid-range lenses and a 35mm 1.4 which was magic. I also had 3 batteries, a few chargers, a few cards and a bag that I rarely used. <b>It ended up being just over $2k when I bought everything brand new. </b>If you check prices now, you could get that camera for almost half that price, and I’m totally aware of that. However, it still doesn’t change what I lost in terms of investment. What I’d like to do is <b>set a goal of $1k </b>(which will help me tremendously) but <b>shoot for $2k which will mean I effectively lost nothing</b>, and will help me get the most recent version of the camera that I had originally. </p><p>The reality is that if <b>100 of my friends pitch in $20 bucks,</b> I'm at my highest goal where I effectively didn't lose a dime. You will have helped un-steal the thing that was stolen. <b>It will be like it never happened, and that's incredible.<span><br/></span></b><span><br/></span>So this is it. If you've read this far, then at least you care about what's happening in my life. <b>This is the part where you get to decide if you want to help any how much you are able to.</b> It's also the part where I tell you that I'm grateful either way.<span><br/></span></p><p>Thank you all so, so, so much. I'm both intimidated and excited by this experience. <span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span><b>Now let's get it.</b></span></p><p></p></div>","UPDATE no. 1  |  FIRST GOAL HIT IN 2 DAYS!____________________________________You did it.

This is a good way for us to meet, not because you bought my time, but because I don’t know a better way to tell someone “thanks” than in person.Regardless, I'm running this campaign a little different than traditional ones. Here’s where my head’s at:1) I'M ONLY ASKING MY FRIENDS. I am not opening this up to a web-wide beg where I ask you all to share this with your friends and they ask them to share it when theirs. I’m begging only from my friends. There’s something cool about having access to a community of people who appreciate your stuff and, while the circumstances suck, using the platform that introduced you to say “Hey, can I have your help?"". Listen, it’s not YOUR fault that my camera was stolen, but you might be someone who is able to contribute to undoing the whole “fault” thing in the first place. That’s really bizarre and really amazing. 2) I WANT TO MAKE THIS LESS ABOUT THE REWARDS. Honestly, I’m turning to the one group of people who might most care about something as silly as my Instagramming and I’m asking them to help if they feel like they appreciate it enough to do that. I want people to pitch in not because they want a “reward” but because they empathize and because they enjoy the tiny photos and hopefully interesting quotes they see coupled together on their phones from me every other day. I want to be super up front about this from the start: I’m absolutely putting effort into the rewards because I want to give you something for giving me something, but I don’t want to hide the fact that I’m asking you to be generous. The rewards are an incentive, of course, and I'm cool with that, but let’s be real: I’m stuck and I’m asking for your help in getting me un-stuck.3) I REFUSE TO DRAG THIS THING OUT. I’m making this campaign 10 days long because I cannot be ok with posting for 20, 40 or 60 days in an effort to talk people into buying something for me that they didn’t lose. I’d much rather you decide whether giving is something you feel good about, and if you do...you just go for it. I’m asking for help from whoever can help, as soon as they are able to help and for as much as they can afford to help. I literally want to hit my goal within 48 hours. If I don’t, I’ll have a few more days to post and plead. I'm going as big as I can for one week and then I'm out. Think we can do it?4) I’M STARTING IT OUT AT $10. Here’s the thing, I know how important money is. It’s the reason I can’t afford to drop another $2,000 on a new camera right now. Money matters in a lot of ways so I've decided that if someone can only afford to spare one dollar, I’d rather they keep it and use it where they need it. I’ve been torn between the whole “Let them give what they can” and “Don’t ask for cash from people who shouldn’t really be giving it” philosophies. After some thinking, I’ve decided to go with ""Option B"". This has nothing to do with not appreciating a dollar from a friend who is giving me what they're able, and everything to do with opting to ask my friends who are in a better financial space to give more because it's easier for them.------------------Again, this is an odd place for me. I feel lucky to have a chance at seeing my camera replaced by people whom I’ve met through a medium that didn’t even exist 5 years ago, and equally embarrassed to be giving them the opportunity to do so. But I finally decided to do it after being encouraged by my real-life friends and when I realized that I would WANT to know if one of my favorite insta-friends had some misfortune and I could help undo that misfortune.What I had: I had purchased the Fuji X-M1 when it was relatively new. I had that body, a couple mid-range lenses and a 35mm 1.4 which was magic. I also had 3 batteries, a few chargers, a few cards and a bag that I rarely used. It ended up being just over $2k when I bought everything brand new. If you check prices now, you could get that camera for almost half that price, and I’m totally aware of that. However, it still doesn’t change what I lost in terms of investment. What I’d like to do is set a goal of $1k (which will help me tremendously) but shoot for $2k which will mean I effectively lost nothing, and will help me get the most recent version of the camera that I had originally. The reality is that if 100 of my friends pitch in $20 bucks, I'm at my highest goal where I effectively didn't lose a dime. You will have helped un-steal the thing that was stolen. It will be like it never happened, and that's incredible.So this is it. If you've read this far, then at least you care about what's happening in my life. This is the part where you get to decide if you want to help any how much you are able to. It's also the part where I tell you that I'm grateful either way.Thank you all so, so, so much. I'm both intimidated and excited by this experience. Now let's get it.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Children love cameras. They love having their picture taken &amp; they love snapping the pictures themselves. We want to bring this love &amp; joy to kids who have never held a camera before. Kids who would never have a chance to otherwise. They’ll see themselves &amp; their lives through a different lens. Literally.</p>

<br/>Why a photography workshop?</h2>
<p>I was walking through Cité Soleil, the largest slum in the Western Hemisphere located in Haiti, one of the poorest places on Earth. Trash littered the streets and dirty stagnant rainwater was often used as latrines. The sun pulsated directly overhead, bleaching the blue sky to a blinding white. Sweat droplets raced down my spine and pooled at my lower back. Children dressed in rags – or for some, in nothing at all – played a spirited game of soccer with a half-inflated ball. I snapped a picture of a group of rambunctious kids, only to have eager young hands grab at my camera to see the image captured on my screen. </p>
<p>The novelty of the reproduction faded and most darted off between the shanty houses. One remained, diligently pointing at each face on the screen, as if ticking them off in his head. He stopped at the last one. His own. He let out a burst of pure, innocent, giggling glee and scampered off. Alone, I realized that for people who have next to nothing, a mirror was an unattainable luxury. This child only met his reflection by process of elimination. For he knew which ones were his friends and which one was the stranger.</p>
<p>I was struck dumb. For I never realized a person could walk through life without knowing his own physical self. But photography can change that. It lets a child see himself &amp; his world through different eyes. By learning tangible skills &amp; a new avenue of self-expression, he can contribute to his life &amp; his community.</p>

<br/>What we’re taking on.</h2>
<p>We partnered with Respire Haiti, a school in Gressier, Haiti that educates restaveks (child slaves), to hold a week-long workshop in January 2013.

Twenty-five students will document their own stories in relation to the commemoration of a national disaster. Some will discover the possibility of being a photographer / a journalist / a storyteller when they grow up. For others, the workshop will be a healing tool to help them discover who they are beyond the forced servitude they are subjected to. We will also host a gallery show at the end of the week showcasing the students’ images. The show will allow the children to show their self-worth to themselves &amp; to their caregiver families. </p>

</p><p>THE INTRODUCTION<br/>
<i>Since 27 years I live in Graz. I was raised here, went to school here,
studied here. Now it’s enough. I love this city but I have to grow, broaden my
horizon, see and learn. I need to leave!</i></p><p><br/></p><p><br/>
ABSTRACT<br/>
I want to roam, starting in Amsterdam. Making photographs of things I like: food, crafts, sailing... I would like to inspire other people and document
what I will learn. I tought in a workshop for analogue photography to earn some money alongsides my studies. As I will spend the little money I have on traveling I need financial
help to buy camera gear. The photographs I shoot I want to provide primarely free: to
motivate and inspire. And more should follow (Books, Magazines, etc.)<br/></p>
<br/><p><br/>
THE DETAILS<br/>
<br/>
<b>My Project</b><br/>
To ask people to finance a personal camera equipment is quite frankly selfish. Bit  photographs of other people gave me energy when I felt
somehow exhausted working or studying during the last years. They let me escape everyday
life and let me dream, so I could rest for a moment.<br/>
Now I want to deliver such pictures and let other people
dream or escape their boundaries for a few minutes, when they look at my
photographs on my website, blog or even my photobooks.<br/>
<br/>
<b>The first step: Amsterdam</b><br/>
I am especially interested in food and crafts so I will seek interesting places
and people to document their experience and expertise. As an ongoing engineer I like to
look for innovative products concerning energy supply and transport. This made
me plan to go to Amsterdam in spring 2017, as the first destination on my
hopefully worldwide-ish roam. I can imagine Amsterdam nearby big harbors with a lot
of food and spices shipped to Europe will satisfy my needs at first. Additionally, I
have always considered the bike as the best transport system in a city and in
Amsterdam I guess I'm at the right place for that - maybe I will find a job
concerning bicycles, traffic and engineering. At last, there is another big
issue, that drag me to Amsterdam. The fair-transport project with the old
sailing ship ""Tres Hombres"" has its home port just an hour away
from Amsterdam (check it out: <a href=""http://fairtransport.eu/ships/tres-hombres)."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://fairtransport.eu/ships/tres-hombres).</a> A
ship that transports regularly high quality organic rum from the Caribbean to Europe
just with the power of the wind. I want to see that!<br/>
<b><br/>
My Background</b><br/>
I started to shoot photographs in high school where we had many of somewhat artistic presentations.
Then, for a rather long time, I forgot how much I liked it. I have always
needed to work during my studies to pay my bills. During a chemistry workshop I
did for children, a colleague and I decided to do an analogue BW photography
experiment. I was hooked! Soon had my own analogue photography workshop using my dad's old analogue camera. I
watched and read a lot about photography and was able to borrow camera gear
from friends to play and learn. Now I want to get more serious with an own
camera gear.<br/>
<br/>
<b>The Benefits</b><br/>
I want to deliver the best photographs I am able to shoot documenting the
experiences I make during my journey, to give insides in new cultures, portrait
the best craftsmen at what they do best, shoot the best food and the most awesome
spices, while I'm traveling with a 100-year-old sailing ship. And all this for
free: to motivate and inspire.<br/>
<br/>
<b>The Risk</b><br/>
I am a passionate photographer but I am not a professional (at least not by
now). There is a slightly chance of my photographs no being that perfect,
inspiring or motivating (at least at the beginning). It would be great to give
me a chance!<br/>
<br/>
<b>The Gear</b><br/>
I want to make it short. I really would love to own:</p>
<p>A Canon or Nikon. The all-rounder 5D (Canon) or the D810 (nikon) seem really perfect for my needs. The two of the best lenses I can get for my budget: something like a fixed 50
mm and a something to ~ 200 mm including filters to protect them.<br/>
Finally a bag to transport them safely.<br/>
The rest of the money (if there is some)  will be spent on flashcards, filters, extra batteries, a
tripod, reflector, and maybe on a new laptop (mine is 8 years old).<br/>
<br/>
<b>You want to help - in another way?</b><br/>
It is a lot what I am asking for. If you can't spend any money, but want to
help, I always need contacts to photographers to learn, craftsmen, sailors,
chefs for photographing their work, or to people who sell equipment.<span></span></p><p><br/><span>

 and I'm going to buy a Canon Rebel T5i camera, which will be a massive 
upgrade over my current Rebel T2i. I want to get a 70-200mm f2.8 
telephoto lens to pair with it. It's like the telephoto lens I have now,
 with one huge difference, the fixed aperture at f2.8. In simple terms, 
taking pictures is all about how much light gets into the camera, and 
f2.8 would allow basically twice as much light as I can get with the

 me zooming to get a better picture. </p><p>With this new lens I would 
be able to get twice as much light into the lens, which will make for 
better pictures. They won't be as grainy and fuzzy looking because I 
won't have to max out the ISO to make things visible. Shots at night 
will be immensely better and I'll actually be able to capture action. 
Indoor shots, like at comedy shows, will look great because I'll 
actually be able to get light into the lens and capture action 
simultaneously. Essentially, with the combination of the new camera I'm 
buying and the new lens you're donating toward, every picture I take 
will be twice as good as what I was capable of taking before. </p><p>If 
everyone I've ever taken a picture of donated just $5 I'd be able to buy

use a picture I've taken as a profile picture, or when people use one of my pictures for their business or promotional material, or when people tell me 
they have a picture I've taken framed in their house. I will continue
 taking pictures and posting them on Facebook for free either way. 
Photography has never been a business for me, I've never made money from
 it and I don't intend to. I'm hoping you'll help me to get this lens so
 that I can take even better pictures for everyone. </p>

<h2>Why is Kylin M Unique?</h2>
<p><i><strong>Physical design (visible items)：</strong></i></p>
<ul>
<li>The world’s first rotatable handle design, enables you to carry it with ease in addition to the standard fishing rod carry position. Carry mode makes it much easier to film at different angles especially for low angle shoot.</li>
<li>With Snoppa’s special control cable (option), you can directly control the photo shutter/focus, video record, and zoom for popular cameras (Sony and Panasonic for the time being) making filming more convenient.</li>
<li>Roll track mode is supported, in addition to pan track, omni track and lock modes.</li>
<li>Light and portable. Compared with other big gimbals, the Kylin M has a lighter body and is primarily designed for lightweight cameras. Paired with the unique carry mode, a videographer has more flexibility and filming freedom.</li>
</ul>
<p><i><strong>System design (non visible items):</strong></i></p>
<ul>
<li>The Kylin M has a parallel bus (instead of a serial port that most other gimbals have), which has excellent extension capabilities. We’ve preserved a bus interface port on the handle (the hole above the zoom button) through which the Kylin M can already equip many accessories and support for many more in the near future.</li>
<li>Using our own independently developed algorithms, specially developed over four years, has great controllable stability, excellent adaptability, and more extendable abilities.<br/> </li>
</ul>
</div>
</div><h2>Compatible with various lightweight filming devices</h2><p>The Kylin M is primarily created for lightweight cameras and is compatible with lightweight DSLR, mirrorless DC, mobile phones and action cameras. It comes with a special control cable which lets users control shutter/focus, video recording and zoom conveniently.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519291617/jt9ph30fhovepylj8aky.png"" src=""""/></p><h2> </h2><h2>Two Transformable Handling Modes</h2><p>Unlike other gimbal stabilizers which allow for straight holding only, Kylin M comes with 2 handling modes; the straight holding mode (which is suitable for high angle and medium angle filming) and the carry mode (which is best for low angle filming). Users can film easily at various angles because of its unique design. </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518414816/mjcjuxbb2vmf6e2bbp9w.png"" src=""""/></p><div><div><p> </p></div></div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1518415489/phxijz5oergzbnilypps.png"" src=""""/><br/> </p><p><u><i><strong>Demo film of carry mode shooting at low angles</strong></i></u></p><div>

<p><strong>Kylin M</strong> is the ideal stabilizer for mobile phone filming enthusiasts who like to use their mobile phones with other heavy camera accessories for high-quality filming output.

<h2>Strength and Durability in a Lightweight Body</h2>
</div>
<div>
<p>The extremely light-weight Kylin M comes in at just 980g/2.16 lb (including the batteries) while its payload capacity reaches up to 1300g/2.87 lb, compatible with almost all mirrorless digital cameras on the market, as well as mobile phones, action cameras and even some models of DSLR cameras. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517841954/j79n0lbbxrea6bhqrtan.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Notice: 1300g(2.87 lb) is just a rough estimation. The payload depends not only on the weight of the whole filming device (camera + lens), but also the position of its center of gravity. </p>
<p>If the weight is over 1300g but the center of gravity is close to the gimbal, it may also work.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""> </h2>
<h2>Unique Foldable Handle Design</h2>
<p><i><strong>For Portability</strong></i></p>
<p>The Kylin M’s unique rotatable and foldable handle design allows it to be folded into carry mode.</p>
<p>When the Kylin M is folded into carry mode, the dimensions are only 22 wide and 25cm long, and it can easily fit in a bag for transport.</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: left;"">FAQ</h2>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">1) How long is the warranty?    </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The Kylin M comes with a 12 month limited warranty for Indiegogo backers. We also ensure that every unit is free from manufacturing defects and handled with the utmost care during shipment.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/>2) Which filming devices are compatible with Kylin M?    </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Kylin M is primarily designed for light weight filming devices. The actual payload is related not only to the weight of device itself (camera+lens), but also to the position of the center of gravity. If the total weight of filming device is beyond 1300g while the center of gravity is close to the gimbal, it may also work.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/>3) Why not to make the Kylin M compatible with heavier cams?</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Technically it would be easy for us to make the Kylin M with heavier weights (for example, by enlarging the motors and arms), but we would have to sacrifice the portability and make the gimbal heavier. This is not necessary for users of more lightweight cams and would make the whole experience unconformable.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We have to find a balance between weight/portability and payload.  The higher the payload, the heavier the gimbal will be.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">In Snoppa’s stabilizer series, Kylin M is designed for lightweight filming devices, with the ability of bearing more weight than ordinary small-scale handheld gimbals for action cameras or phones (in some cases people may add heavier accessories like wide-angle lenses, lights and microphones etc to the phone)  while it is not as heavy as large-scale gimbals for big DSLRs or pro cams. In this case users can have a much better experience filming with lightweight cameras.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">For those who need to film with heavier cameras, we are working on another Kylin model (tentatively named the Kylin Pro) which is also very uniquely designed and more powerful to bear more weight, but the body is much heavier than current model M. We will release this new model later once it is in production stage.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">4) Will there be control cable support for other cameras?</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Currently we only support Sony and Panasonic for the time being. For users of other camera brands please send us your camera model, then we will make a statistics on the demand of other camera models and to decide from which brand/model we should continue to develop.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/>5) How long does it take to get a full battery charge?    </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The battery in Kylin M requires 3 hours from full discharge to full charge with our supplied charger.  </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;""><br/>6) Is Kylin M waterproof? </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">No, it’s just splash proof.<br/> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">7) Is there a dual-hand handle accessory?</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Yes, we have planned to design and produce a dual-hand handle, and will be available world-wide soon. If you wanna hold your Kylin M with two hands to relieve the pressure on your single arm, you can choose this optional accessory soon.<br/> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">8) When I can receive my order? </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">We’ve already prepared several hundred sets of materials in stock and have assembled nearly a hundred completed units, some of which we had already sent out to some KOLs and friends of filming pros for review. The first production run was interrupted for two weeks by Chinese lunar new year holidays in February, and we will continue the production at the bottom of February and start to place orders for more materials in early March for the increased demand.</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">The shipment of the first batch of Kylin M will begin from the bottom of March 2018 after the crowdfunding ends. Actual ship dates will vary depending on your country, your location, and when you’ve placed your order. We will keep you up to date on every step of the process. </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">In order to deliver Kylin M safely and efficiently, the orders will be dispatched by different courier companies, depending on the destination regions. Consequently we may ship out in a slightly different order from the initial buying sequence.<br/> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">9) Why order now?    </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">For promotion purpose we launched this crowdfunding campaign at a remarkable discount in return for all your support.<br/> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">10) Why is the shipping seems high?</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">A: We spent a lot of time deciding on the right shipping partner and cost. We are afraid to choose a shipping company that is cheaper as we would be left with the bill if the product is damaged or lost, and we don’t want you the customer to receive damaged goods or even lose it.<br/> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">11) Change of address?    </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">If you need to update your address, please contact our support team: indiegogo@snoppa.com<br/> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">12) Indiegogo’s shipping location lists me in the wrong country?</p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">At the end of the campaign, we will send out a survey confirming where you would like your Kylin M to be shipped.<br/> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">13) What is your refund policy?    </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Refunds are processed on a case-by-case basis. At some point we will need to lock down refunds in order to go into production and ship product to you. We will not be able to refund orders once they've shipped.<br/> </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">14) Do I have to pay VAT / GST?    </p>
<p style=""text-align: left;"">Customers are responsible for assuring the product can be lawfully imported to the destination country. The recipient is the importer of record and must comply with all laws and regulations of the destination country. Orders shipped may be subject to import taxes, customs duties and fees levied by the destination country. The recipient of an international shipment may be subject to such import taxes, customs duties and fees, which are levied once a shipment reaches the recipient's country. Additional charges for customs clearance must be fulfilled by the recipient. Snoppa has no control over these charges.</p>
</div></div>","KYLIN M: Rebranding the Concept of FilmingThe Kylin M is the world’s first revolutionary gimbal stabilizer with a rotatable handle designed to provide ease and better filming output. Its flexible design improves filming accuracy and makes filming more convenient than using traditional gimbals. wedding film demo


A short film shot with Sony 6300 and Kylin M, filmed by Karim in France. Thanks for sharing.


 
Original clips demo


To show the raw clips filmed with Kylin M gimbal and some cameras (Sony, Fujifilm, iPhone7 plus) without any special editing like speed adjustment, software stabilization, color correction etc. The original sound in the clips are also kept on purpose. 
 


Why is Kylin M Unique?
Physical design (visible items)：

The world’s first rotatable handle design, enables you to carry it with ease in addition to the standard fishing rod carry position. Carry mode makes it much easier to film at different angles especially for low angle shoot.
With Snoppa’s special control cable (option), you can directly control the photo shutter/focus, video record, and zoom for popular cameras (Sony and Panasonic for the time being) making filming more convenient.
Roll track mode is supported, in addition to pan track, omni track and lock modes.
Light and portable. Compared with other big gimbals, the Kylin M has a lighter body and is primarily designed for lightweight cameras. Paired with the unique carry mode, a videographer has more flexibility and filming freedom.

System design (non visible items):

The Kylin M has a parallel bus (instead of a serial port that most other gimbals have), which has excellent extension capabilities. We’ve preserved a bus interface port on the handle (the hole above the zoom button) through which the Kylin M can already equip many accessories and support for many more in the near future.
Using our own independently developed algorithms, specially developed over four years, has great controllable stability, excellent adaptability, and more extendable abilities. 


Compatible with various lightweight filming devicesThe Kylin M is primarily created for lightweight cameras and is compatible with lightweight DSLR, mirrorless DC, mobile phones and action cameras. It comes with a special control cable which lets users control shutter/focus, video recording and zoom conveniently. Two Transformable Handling ModesUnlike other gimbal stabilizers which allow for straight holding only, Kylin M comes with 2 handling modes; the straight holding mode (which is suitable for high angle and medium angle filming) and the carry mode (which is best for low angle filming). Users can film easily at various angles because of its unique design.    Demo film of carry mode shooting at low angles

 

Also mobile phone compatible



Kylin M is the ideal stabilizer for mobile phone filming enthusiasts who like to use their mobile phones with other heavy camera accessories for high-quality filming output. It provides the balance between small scale handheld phone stabilizers (which does not allow inclusion of external camera accessories) and big scale stabilizers (which allow for inclusion of accessories but are too big for carrying convenience)
In the above picture, the iPhone7 plus mounted on Kylin M is equipped with Zeiss Exo wide-angle lens, and Shure MV88 microphone. In addition, you can also add a light on it if necessary.

 
Test with Kylin M and iphone7


 
 
All Controls Integrated in the Handle Panel 



With our specially designed connecting cable, you have direct shooting control for some popular cameras with buttons right on the handle, including focus/photo shutter, video record and zoom. 
Currently supported camera control: Panasonic Lumix GH4/GH5, Sony mirrorless DC.

 
 

1/4 inch screw extendable


The bottom of the Kylin M’s handle has a ¼ inch threaded hole for users to connect a tripod. This allows you to sit the camera on a spot and helps to extend other ways of filming controls.
 



 
Following Modes


Filmmakers can shoot via various different modes.
Pan track modeRoll and tilt axes are locked, pan left and right following the arm movement, pushing the joystick up and down to tilt.
Lock modePan, roll and tilt axes are all locked, pushing the joystick to pan or tilt.
Omni track modeRoll axis is locked, pan and tilt following the arm movement.
Roll track modePan and tilt axes are locked,  gimbal can be rolled by pushing the joystick left and right, or by rolling your arm. 


 

 
Strength and Durability in a Lightweight Body


The extremely light-weight Kylin M comes in at just 980g/2.16 lb (including the batteries) while its payload capacity reaches up to 1300g/2.87 lb, compatible with almost all mirrorless digital cameras on the market, as well as mobile phones, action cameras and even some models of DSLR cameras. 

Notice: 1300g(2.87 lb) is just a rough estimation. The payload depends not only on the weight of the whole filming device (camera + lens), but also the position of its center of gravity. 
If the weight is over 1300g but the center of gravity is close to the gimbal, it may also work.
 
 
Unique Foldable Handle Design
For Portability
The Kylin M’s unique rotatable and foldable handle design allows it to be folded into carry mode.
When the Kylin M is folded into carry mode, the dimensions are only 22 wide and 25cm long, and it can easily fit in a bag for transport.




 High Decoupling SystemWith our brand new attitude resolving algorithm, each controlling axis is separated from each other, in order to avoid mutual interference. Extendable Bus InterfaceThanks to the application of a local network controller, we’ve separately preserved a bus interface on the gimbal plate and handle, through which we can attach accessories adding more options and convenience.Example of BUS interface application   Camera Control Cable(optional accessory)With the Kylin M’s built-in bus system and our specially designed control cable accessory, we can realize the camera control through the handle buttons, realizing functions of photo focus/shutter, video record and zoom.


 
 
 
Dual Power Source that Keeps Your Camera Charged and Running

Kylin M is equipped with 2 Li-ion batteries 26500 (3200mAh), which can support at least 12 hours of runtime. With the control cable connected, when the gimbal is powered on, it can directly charge your camera to prevent a dead battery from interrupting/ruining your shoot. 
 
 
 
Specifications   
The Kylin Pro is equipped with dual handles as well as a detachable central handle, giving you more options while filming or even during downtime between shoots.
There’s a lock ring on the left and right arm, through which you can adjust the handle to any angle you want and then lock it.
 

 


Thåe three handles can work as a tripod that allow the Kylin Pro to stand on the ground, without the need of an extra tripod.

 




 
Rotatable Handle

There’s a lock ring on the left and right arm, through which you can adjust the handle to any angle you want and then lock it.
 
 




1. Camera parameters
2. focus control
3. control wheel for camera parameters
The Kylin Pro integrates a 1.8 inch OLED color screen on its right handle, through which you can read the camera parameters in realtime, including ISO, aperture, and shutter speed.
With the control wheel on the side of the left handle, you can adjust the camera parameters directly, without the need of manually adjusting settings on the camera itself.
Focus can be adjusted by the slider. By pushing the focus button up and down you can easily control the focus position.






1.  HDMI port
2.  CAN bus port
3.  3.5mm Mic
The Kylin Pro has a video output interface built-in allowing you to directly connect your camera and monitor through theintegrated HDMI ports. This prevents cable clutter from affecting the stability of your video, giving you an all around better viewing and recording experience.
The CAN expansion bus can easily connect with our focus controller (soon to be released), an external fill light, remote control and other accessories.
There is also an integrated 3.5mm external microphone jack, allowing you to attach a variety of microphones to the stabilizer. Attaching a high-quality microphone through the stabilizer will allow you to get better audio than the camera’s built-in microphone.





 
Extension Holes for External Devices

There are three 3/8 inch threaded holes and four 1/4 inch threaded holes on the horizontal arm, which are reserved for mounting accessories like external monitor, single handle, microphone support, light support, extension pole and so on.







 
Collapsible arms(Quick spring lock)
 
 
 
 

The left and right arms of the Kylin Pro are collapsible. With the quick release spring locks on the joint of each arm, you can easily fold and unfold the arms quickly, without any troublesome mounting or un-mounting steps.
 





 
Fixing the Mounting Position

Normally you have to rebalance the gimbal after removing the quick release plate to maintain proper stabilization. But on the Kylin Pro, we added a guide to the bottom of the gimbal plate, which allows you to quickly reattach the plate in the proper position.

18 July 1610 Baroque Style painter Michelangelo Merisi, better known
as Caravaggio, died in the little village of Porto Ercole in the
South of Tuscany after a tumultuous life.</i><i> 400
years later in the summer 2010 a team of 3 young artists gave –
after two years of deep research, intense preparation and hard work
involving the whole village – birth to the contemporary art project
CARAVAGGIO MMX. 
</i>
</p><p>Hi, I'm Giuseppe Zanoni, I was born in Porto Ercole,
Tuscany, Italy in the 1970. When I was a child, I was very passionate
about art and I started to draw. At the age of 12 years, a friend
gave me a photocamera. Oh....love at first sight! It was amazing to
discover the reality with this equipment and I started with the
photography which then became my job.</p>
<p>In the 2004, with Annegriet Camilla Spoerndle and
Giacomo Pietrapiana, I founded ""Melograno"", a No Profit
Association with the goal to realize visual projects. Since 2004 the
projects submitted to the local authorities are directed to the
search for new forms of communication. This research, combined with
the experience of Melograno members, led to the creation of new form
of educational and cultural activities in the field of visual arts in
our area.</p>
<p>In
the 2008, we decided to investigate about the great painter
Caravaggio.</p><p><b>CARAVAGGIO
MMX – Homage to the great art rebel in 8 contemporary
photographical reinterpretations</b></p>
<p>Yet
in his lifetime CARAVAGGIO was known for his unconventional and
epoch-making character – in his personality, relationships and in
his art.</p>
<p>He
lived a life like a real Bohemian, passing his time with (fe)male
prostitutes, drugs and street fightings like a real rock’n’roll
star and he caused a rumpus by integrating his flamboyant lifestyle
in his artworks – by ignoring completely the classical idealism
which dominated the whole art scene at his lifetime and by
„highlighting“ his subjects as they really were – with all
natural physical and emotional defects and a extreme dramatic use of
lighting, which has never been seen before.</p>
<p>With
the intent to pay tribute to this famous painter in the place where
he died in his 400th anniversary of death, we developped 8
photographical reinterpretations of eight masterpieces of Caravaggio,
based on the following guidelines:</p>  1. Caravaggio
	was a society observer.<br/><br/><p>
What would have aroused his
interest, when he was alive in 2010? 
</p>
<p>
Our answer was: Problems you
generally don't like talk about like teen and work problems, trash
tv, family violence, MAFIA, AIDS, WAR</p>
<p>
In 8 contemporary
reinterpretations with the spirit of 2010, but maintaining dimension,
light and composition of Caravaggio’s paintings.</p>  2. Caravaggio
	was a photographical painter.<br/><br/><p>
But would he have even painted
in 2010? 
</p>
<p>
Our answer was: No, he would
have used a photo camera, because Dr. Lapucci, Director of the
Department of Restoration at the SACI Studio Art Centers
International in Florence, associates Caravaggio’s painting
technique with the origins of photography. So she demonstrated that
he was using photosensitive material as base of his paintings just
400 years ago 
</p>
<p>
Using a view camera on sheet
films, scanned and printed on Hahnemühle best quality paper, without
the infinite possibilities of digital photography and the virtuous
tricks of digital post production. What you see, existed exactly like
that in the studio. Not only the composition, the pose of the models
and the objects, but even the incidence of light, the shadows of the
protagonists, the chromatic graduation.</p>  3. Caravaggio
	felt himself close to the common people.<br/><br/><p>
So would he have used
professional models for his 2010 photographs? 
</p>
<p>
Our answer was: No, he
would’nt. He would have worked, as he did, with the simple people
who surrounded and inspired him 
</p>
<p>
The participation of Porto
Ercole residents as protagonists of the photographs completes the
temporal circle that began 400 years ago. Porto Ercole is no longer
the place, where Caravaggio died, but also the place where his works
- forever contemporary – have been revisited and continue to
exist.<br/><br/></p><p><b>CARAVAGGIO

</p>
<p>I will start May 1 from
Rome following the cycle route <a href=""http://www.eurovelo.com/en/eurovelos/eurovelo-7"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">EuroVelo 7 - The Sun Route</a> in
5900km through Italy , Austria, Czech Republic , Germany, Denmark,
Sweden , Finland and Norway will take me to the North Cape.</p>
<p>Why Rome - North Cape?
Since I started traveling and photograph with the pinhole get to
the North Cape by bicycle is one of the trips of my dreams that I
have repeated periodically to do, but because of fear or lack of time
and money, I always put off, so at age 42 I decided to put aside
their fears and take the time to realize the adventure of my dreams.</p>
<p>Travel and photograph with
the pinhole camera is an integral part of my way of seeing the
photography and life, almost all of my photo projects are born when
they are traveling or are a result of a trip.</p>
<p>Using the pinhole camera
for more than 20 years, using cameras handcrafted , and always came
with me from the first trip in 1995, a cost to cost from <a href=""http://www.artmajeur.com/it/artist/lucabaldassari/collection/stati-uniti/1264393"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://www.artmajeur.com/it/artist/lucabaldassari/collection/stati-uniti/1264393"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">New York to Los Angeles</a></p><p></p><p>This time I decided to leave by bicycle
because as the pinhole camera helps me to slow down, to look for my
times, slowing down and I see things better and I feel longer in
contact with the way so feel better beaty, gives me the opportunity
to stop when I want to take a picture or to make friends with the
people I meet along the way,  maybe just to exchange a greeting
gesture.</p><p></p>
<p>I am of the idea that the
deliberate slow pace allow me to find a connection/link with what I'm
doing/trying and let me see/photographing in a different manner the
places that through.</p>
<p>I decided to do some
50/70km per day , a distance which I think allows me to find the
right balance between distance traveled and time required to develop
good pictures, camping or sleeping in self-sufficiency using
<a href=""https://www.couchsurfing.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">couchsurfing</a> and <a href=""https://www.warmshowers.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">warmshowers</a> , especially in big cities, such as Prague or Berlin, and when it
will be possible to bring the food to cook but once a week I'm going
to eat at least one meal in the country that will host me because  am
convinced that sample the local cuisine, as well as visit the places
and meet the people is an integral part of a journey.</p><h3>Something about me:</h3>

I did not reach the goal</h4>
<p>I have often wondered what
will happen if I do not get to the goal? I'll start it anyway because
this is a dream and dreams should be followed, perhaps not be able to
leave Rome and I'll do a stretch by train or plane to cut kilometers and
days of travel, it is sure that I leave because I bought a return
ticket!</p><p>As with all travel the unexpected is always around the corner
unexpectedly a break of the bike, a fall and broke an arm and the
journey is finished, you put it in the account, the trips are a way which helps us to grow and adapt in front of the difficulties that life
presents to us.</p><p><br/></p><h3>A note on the printing

</h2><p>ciao mi chiamo Luca Baldassari e sono un fotografo ho bisogno del vostro supporto per realizzare il viaggio fotografico “un foro stenopeico a Capo Nord” prosecuzione del progetto fotografico “in giro per il mondo con il foro stenopeico” che è diventato parte della mia vita.</p><p>Partirò il primo di maggio da Roma seguendo il percorso ciclabile <a href=""http://www.eurovelo.com/en/eurovelos/eurovelo-7"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">EuroVelo 7</a> – La Strada del Sole che in 5900km attraversando l’Italia,  l’Austria, la Repubblica Ceca, la Germania, la Danimarca, la Svezia , la Finlandia e la Norvegia mi porterà a Capo Nord.</p><p>Perché Roma – Capo Nord? Da quando ho iniziato a viaggiare e fotografare con il foro arrivare a Capo Nord in bici è uno dei viaggi dei miei sogni che periodicamente mi sono riproposto di fare, ma per paura, per mancanza di tempo e di soldi ho sempre rimandato, così a 42 anni ho deciso di mettere da parte le paure e prendermi il tempo per realizzare l’avventura dei miei sogni.</p><p>Viaggiare e fotografare con il foro stenopeico è parte integrante del mio modo di vedere la fotografia e la vita, quasi tutti i miei progetti fotografici nascono quando sono in viaggio o sono conseguenza di un viaggio.</p><p>Utilizzo il foro stenopeico da più di 20 anni anni, usando macchine fotografiche artigianali auto prodotte, ed è sempre venuto con me dal primo viaggio nel 1995 un coast to coast da <a href=""http://www.artmajeur.com/it/artist/lucabaldassari/collection/stati-uniti/1264393"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">New York a Los Angels</a>.</p><p>Questa volta ho deciso di partire in bicicletta perché come  il foro stenopeico mi aiuta a rallentare, a cercare i miei tempi, e rallentando vedo meglio le cose e mi sento più a contatto con il percorso che sto facendo a percepirne meglio la bellezza. Mi offre la possibilità di fermarmi quando voglio per scattare una foto o per fare amicizia con le persone che incontro lungo la strada, magari per  scambiarci solo un cenno di saluto.</p><p>Sono dell’idea che la lentezza deliberata mi aiuti a trovare una connessione/collegamento con quello che sto facendo/cercando e mi faccia vedere/fotografare in modo diverso i luoghi che attraverso.</p><p>Ho deciso di fare circa 50/70km al giorno, una distanza che credo mi permetta di trovare il giusto equilibrio tra spazio percorso e tempo necessario per elaborare buone immagini,  in autosufficienza dormendo in campeggio o utilizzando il <a href=""https://www.couchsurfing.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">couchsurfing</a> e<a href=""http://www.warmshowers.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">warmshowers</a>, sopratutto nelle grandi città e quando sarà possibile, per il cibo porterò l’occorrente per cucinare ma una volta alla settimana ho intenzione di mangiare almeno un pasto nel paese che mi ospiterà perché sono dell’idea che assaggiare la cucina locale, oltre che visitare i luoghi e incontrare le persone, sia parte integrante di un viaggio.</p><h2>Qualcosa su di me:</h2><p>Diplomato presso l’<a href=""http://www.cine-tv.net/home.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a><a href=""http://www.cine-tv.net/home.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Istituto di Stato per la Cinematografia e Televisione “Roberto Rossellini”</a>  a Roma sezione fotografia nel 1993.</p><p>Riconoscimenti: 2013 Visual Art Author selected – 2010 Confini 08 – winner of the annual review dedicated to the for creative photography – 2009 Author signaled Premio della qualità creativa in fotografia professionale premiofotografico.org – 2009 Adrenalina Author selected adrenalina.roma.it – 2009 Associazione ArtGallery Selected as a photographer of the month associazioneartgallery.org</p><p>Mostre : NAKED CITY – FEST ROMA.

Cercare una condivisione con chi la riceve con la voglia di trasmettere le sensazioni provate o ancora da vivere, con la voglia di cercare un legame o solo di saldarlo.<br/>Ed è in quel momento che ci si stacca da tutto e si comincia a viaggiare con la mente a ripensare a ciò che si è fatto o quello che si potrebbe fare. E’ un modo per far ripartire la nostra immaginazione.<br/>Le attacchiamo al muro o sul frigo e lì rimangono a monito di una possibile fuga, anche quando si scoloriscono è difficile staccarle quasi fossero una via di evasione alla quale ci dispiace rinunciare anche per il tempo di un fuggevole sguardo.</p><p>Le stampe sono a tiratura limitata 1000 formato 15×20 ogni foto ha il timbro a secco, sono stampate su carta epson matte heavyweight con inchiostri claria che garantiscono una durata di circa 90 anni (fonte <a href=""http://www.wilhelm-research.com/epson/WIR_EpR380_2006_11_29.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">epson/WIR_EpR380_2006_11_29.pdf</a>)</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""youtube-player"" height=""310"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/ovBVEOcfKck?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent"" style=""line-height: inherit;"" type=""text/html"" width=""497""></iframe></div><p></p><h2><a href=""http://travellingtwo.com/resources/biketouringbasics/chapter-3-how-much-will-it-cost"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a></h2><h4><b>Moleskine series: </b></h4><p>Sono dei piccoli album montati su<a href=""http://www.moleskine.com/us/collections/model/product/sketchbook-large"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Moleskine Sketchbook</a> formato 5″x8¼” inches – 13x21cm, che uso anche per catalogare le foto originali contengono 50 stampe inkjet stampate su carta<a href=""http://www.hahnemuehle.com/en/digital-fineart/digital-fineart-collection/glossy-fineart/p/Product/show/77/300.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Hahnemühle FineArt Baryta</a> formato 10x13cm,  stampate da  <a href=""http://www.soluzioniarte.it/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Soluzione Arte</a> a Roma, le foto sono rimovibili in modo da poterle utilizzare singolarmente o per cambiare la sequenza della storia che segue un percorso cronologico.</p><p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""youtube-player"" height=""310"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/sBmdzcohCXk?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent"" style=""line-height: inherit;"" type=""text/html"" width=""497""></iframe></div><p></p><h2>Cosa si riceve:</h2><p>1€: I miei sinceri ringraziamenti!

pinhole camera in North Cape

A photographer a pinhole camera and a bicycle on the road for 100 days from Rome to the North
Cape

hi my name is Luca Baldassari and I'm a photographer, I need
your support to achieve ""A pinhole camera in North Cape""
follow-up to the photographic project ""around the world with the pinhole"" that has become part of my life. 

I will start May 1 from
Rome following the cycle route EuroVelo 7 - The Sun Route in
5900km through Italy , Austria, Czech Republic , Germany, Denmark,
Sweden , Finland and Norway will take me to the North Cape.
Why Rome - North Cape?
Since I started traveling and photograph with the pinhole get to
the North Cape by bicycle is one of the trips of my dreams that I
have repeated periodically to do, but because of fear or lack of time
and money, I always put off, so at age 42 I decided to put aside
their fears and take the time to realize the adventure of my dreams.
Travel and photograph with
the pinhole camera is an integral part of my way of seeing the
photography and life, almost all of my photo projects are born when
they are traveling or are a result of a trip.
Using the pinhole camera
for more than 20 years, using cameras handcrafted , and always came
with me from the first trip in 1995, a cost to cost from New York to Los AngelesThis time I decided to leave by bicycle
because as the pinhole camera helps me to slow down, to look for my
times, slowing down and I see things better and I feel longer in
contact with the way so feel better beaty, gives me the opportunity
to stop when I want to take a picture or to make friends with the
people I meet along the way,  maybe just to exchange a greeting
gesture.
I am of the idea that the
deliberate slow pace allow me to find a connection/link with what I'm
doing/trying and let me see/photographing in a different manner the
places that through.
I decided to do some
50/70km per day , a distance which I think allows me to find the
right balance between distance traveled and time required to develop
good pictures, camping or sleeping in self-sufficiency using
couchsurfing and warmshowers , especially in big cities, such as Prague or Berlin, and when it
will be possible to bring the food to cook but once a week I'm going
to eat at least one meal in the country that will host me because  am
convinced that sample the local cuisine, as well as visit the places
and meet the people is an integral part of a journey.Something about me:

How I'll use your
donations:In total I need for my
trip around 9000euro  I decided to split the
money that I will need in budget items, so that it is more clear how
I will use them.
Auto Financing: 2500€ Transport: total 2452,59€2150€ a new bike, unfortunately my bike Di
Bartolomei after 15y.o. business is not suited to the trip that I
want to take, and I decided to take the Surly Ogre is an excellent
compromise between price and quality, with Marco Trailbike we tried to find the best compromise for mount a  cheap
bicycle  but reliable, full rack, bags, lights, mudguards,
dynamo and all the equipment for a safe journey and Solar Panel and Extra batteries19€ Ferry Rostock-Gedser284.59€ Air ticket return Honningsvag - RomeFood and Accommodation: 3000€ I calculated an average
of 30€ a day to eat and sleep for more info about How Much Will It Cost? For accommodation will
sleep mostly camping and if the budget will allow me, in the big
cities,such as Berlin or Prague, i will sleep in the hostels, depending on the availability of
hosting will try to use couchsurfing and warmshowers I think is the
best way to meet new people in the countries I may visit.Camping Equipment: 800€ Tent, sleeping bag, stove,
camping equipment and all the necessary material.Material Photo: 800€ To reduce the cost of the
photographic material, about 80 boxes, I decided to take an average of 7 photo per day, normally I use Fuji film FP 100C45 size 102x131mm - 4x5"" I would like to use a lot of this film but it has
become too expensive and difficult to find I will take with me the
smaller size Fuji FP 100 film format 85 x108mm - 3x4"" much
cheaper.
Production and printing
photos and book: 1950€ about 30% of the funding reached.Risks and ChallengesIf
I did not reach the goal
I have often wondered what
will happen if I do not get to the goal? I'll start it anyway because
this is a dream and dreams should be followed, perhaps not be able to
leave Rome and I'll do a stretch by train or plane to cut kilometers and
days of travel, it is sure that I leave because I bought a return
ticket!As with all travel the unexpected is always around the corner
unexpectedly a break of the bike, a fall and broke an arm and the
journey is finished, you put it in the account, the trips are a way which helps us to grow and adapt in front of the difficulties that life
presents to us.A note on the printing
pressPostcards pinhole Why pinhole postcards?Pinhole postcards are like short tales of my travellings, wandering around with my faithfull pinhole camera.A postcard is something special, we buy it because we want to keep “that” place with us, or sometimes we simply “wish” to go somewhere, and we by a postcard about it. Or we want to share our feelings, and in that particular place we send a nice postcard to someone special.When we look again at them we start travelling again, we think back at what we have alone or at what we are going to do. Looking at our postcards is a way to feel free.We stick them on the wall or on the fridge, and there they stay, as a remainder of a possible escape. They get old and colours are not bright anymore but we don't want to throw them away. They represent on our feelings and our wishes, they are our possible escape even only for the time of a quick look. Moleskine series:They are
little album, mounted on Moleskine Sketchbook, size 5 ""x8 ¼""
inches - 13x21cm, that I also use to catalog the original photos,
contain 50 inkjet prints size 10x13 cm printed on Hahnemühle FineArt Baryta printed by Soluzione Arte in Rome, the photos are removable so you can be used in any other way,
individually or to change the sequence of the story that follows a
chronological path.Thanks for your support, in any amount!
I
will be keeping a blog, facebook, tweet, istagram, while I am traveling that is going to be
updated weekly with images and videos.If you can't pledge, please share, Tweet, Facebook, Google+ or how ever you communicate to your friends about my project. The more people that know about it, the better chance it has of succeeding.
I
wish to thank a few people who have supported the project and who
have made this Indiegogo campaign possible:

Un foro stenopeico a Capo Nord

Un fotografo un foro stenopeico e una bicicletta in strada per 100giorni da Roma a Capo Nord.
ciao mi chiamo Luca Baldassari e sono un fotografo ho bisogno del vostro supporto per realizzare il viaggio fotografico “un foro stenopeico a Capo Nord” prosecuzione del progetto fotografico “in giro per il mondo con il foro stenopeico” che è diventato parte della mia vita.Partirò il primo di maggio da Roma seguendo il percorso ciclabile EuroVelo 7 – La Strada del Sole che in 5900km attraversando l’Italia,  l’Austria, la Repubblica Ceca, la Germania, la Danimarca, la Svezia , la Finlandia e la Norvegia mi porterà a Capo Nord.Perché Roma – Capo Nord? Da quando ho iniziato a viaggiare e fotografare con il foro arrivare a Capo Nord in bici è uno dei viaggi dei miei sogni che periodicamente mi sono riproposto di fare, ma per paura, per mancanza di tempo e di soldi ho sempre rimandato, così a 42 anni ho deciso di mettere da parte le paure e prendermi il tempo per realizzare l’avventura dei miei sogni.Viaggiare e fotografare con il foro stenopeico è parte integrante del mio modo di vedere la fotografia e la vita, quasi tutti i miei progetti fotografici nascono quando sono in viaggio o sono conseguenza di un viaggio.Utilizzo il foro stenopeico da più di 20 anni anni, usando macchine fotografiche artigianali auto prodotte, ed è sempre venuto con me dal primo viaggio nel 1995 un coast to coast da New York a Los Angels.Questa volta ho deciso di partire in bicicletta perché come  il foro stenopeico mi aiuta a rallentare, a cercare i miei tempi, e rallentando vedo meglio le cose e mi sento più a contatto con il percorso che sto facendo a percepirne meglio la bellezza. Mi offre la possibilità di fermarmi quando voglio per scattare una foto o per fare amicizia con le persone che incontro lungo la strada, magari per  scambiarci solo un cenno di saluto.Sono dell’idea che la lentezza deliberata mi aiuti a trovare una connessione/collegamento con quello che sto facendo/cercando e mi faccia vedere/fotografare in modo diverso i luoghi che attraverso.Ho deciso di fare circa 50/70km al giorno, una distanza che credo mi permetta di trovare il giusto equilibrio tra spazio percorso e tempo necessario per elaborare buone immagini,  in autosufficienza dormendo in campeggio o utilizzando il couchsurfing ewarmshowers, sopratutto nelle grandi città e quando sarà possibile, per il cibo porterò l’occorrente per cucinare ma una volta alla settimana ho intenzione di mangiare almeno un pasto nel paese che mi ospiterà perché sono dell’idea che assaggiare la cucina locale, oltre che visitare i luoghi e incontrare le persone, sia parte integrante di un viaggio.Qualcosa su di me:Diplomato presso l’ Istituto di Stato per la Cinematografia e Televisione “Roberto Rossellini”  a Roma sezione fotografia nel 1993.Riconoscimenti: 2013 Visual Art Author selected – 2010 Confini 08 – winner of the annual review dedicated to the for creative photography – 2009 Author signaled Premio della qualità creativa in fotografia professionale premiofotografico.org – 2009 Adrenalina Author selected adrenalina.roma.it – 2009 Associazione ArtGallery Selected as a photographer of the month associazioneartgallery.orgMostre : NAKED CITY – FEST ROMA. LA NUDA CITTÀ 2013 – Musinf – Museo dell’Informazione e Arte Moderna V edizione della Mostra Nazionale di Fotografia Stenopeica (Senigallia) – Città Altra Economia WWPPD 2011 (Roma) – Officine K (Roma) –  Sala Fenice (Trieste) – Lanterna Magica (Palermo) – Polifemo Fotografia (Milano) – Osservatorio Gualino (Torino) – Vision Quest (Genova) – The Brick Lane Gallery (Londra) – Galleria di Via Larga (Firenze) – One-day Pinhole and Reggae Project (Niznevartovsk – Russia) – GARAGE (Omsk – Siberia) – Gallery ART+FACT.LTD (Tashkent – Uzbekistan) – Festival of contemporary art Living Perm (Perm – Russia) – Academy of Photography (Tomsk – Russia) – Galleria RGB46 (Roma) – Enoteca Cavour 313 (Roma) – Fotoforniture Sabatini (Roma) – Ristorante ott8 e mezza (Roma) – VISTA Arte e Comunicazione (Rome) – Adrenalina (Roma) – Casa d’aste Bloomsbury Auction (Roma) – Galleria Eralov (Roma).Come userò le vostre donazioni:In totale mi occorrono per il viaggio circa 7000euroHo deciso di dividere i soldi che mi serviranno in capitoli di spesa in modo che sia più chiaro come li userò.
Auto Finanziamento: 2500€
Trasporti: totale 2452,59€2150€ a una nuova bicicletta. Purtroppo la mia bici Di Bartolomei dopo 15 anni d’attività non è più adatta al viaggio che voglio intraprendere e ho deciso di prendere laSurly Ogre che è un eccellente compromesso tra prezzo e qualità inseme a Marco diTrailbike abbiamo cercato di trovare il miglior compromesso per montare una bicicletta in economia ma affidabile, completa di portapacchi, borse, luci,parafanghi, dinamo e tutte le dotazioni per un viaggio in sicurezza, Pannello solaree batterie extra.19€ Traghetto Rostock-Gedser284.59€ Biglietto aereo di ritorno Honningsvag – RomeCibo e Alloggio: 3000€Ho calcolato una media di 30€ al giorno per mangiare e dormire per maggiori info al riguardo How Much Will It Cost?Per l’alloggio dormirò prevalentemente in campeggio e se il budget me lo permetterà nelle grandi  città, come Praga o Berlino dormirò in ostello, compatibilmente con la disponibilità degli hosting cercherò di usare il couchsurfing e warmshowers credo sia il modo migliore per conoscere nuove persone nei paesi che visiterò.Attrezzatura da Campeggio: 800€Tenda, sacco a pelo, fornello, attrezzatura da campeggio e tutto il materiale necessario.Materiale Fotografico: 800€Per ridurre le spese del materiale fotografico, 80 scatole circa,  ho deciso di scattare una media di 7  foto al giorno con il foro stenopieco, normalmente uso pellicola Fuji film FP 100C45 formato 102x131mm – 4×5” vorrei molto usare questa pellicola ma è diventata troppo costosa e difficile da trovare quindi porterò con me il formato più piccolo Fuji film FP 100 formato 85 x108mm – 3×4″ molto più economicaRischi e sfide – Se non raggiungo l’obiettivoMi sono chiesto più volte cosa succederà se non arrivo all’ obbiettivo?Partirò comunque perché questo è un sogno e i sogni vanno perseguiti, magari non riuscirò a partire da Roma e dovrò fare un tratto in treno  o in aereo per tagliare km e giorni di viaggio ma è sicuro che partirò anche perché ho comprato il biglietto di ritorno.Come in tutti i viaggi l’imprevisto è sempre dietro l’angolo una rottura imprevista della bici, un caduta e si rompe un braccio e il viaggio è finito lo metti in conto, i viaggi ci aiutano a crescere e  adeguarci di fronte alle difficoltà che la vita ci presenta.Una nota sulla stampa premi:Cartoline StenopeichePerché cartoline?Sono del’ idea che quando si spedisce una cartolina o la si compra per sé è perché si vuole rii-tornare a pensare al posto dove si è stati o dove si vorrebbe andare. Cercare una condivisione con chi la riceve con la voglia di trasmettere le sensazioni provate o ancora da vivere, con la voglia di cercare un legame o solo di saldarlo.Ed è in quel momento che ci si stacca da tutto e si comincia a viaggiare con la mente a ripensare a ciò che si è fatto o quello che si potrebbe fare. E’ un modo per far ripartire la nostra immaginazione.Le attacchiamo al muro o sul frigo e lì rimangono a monito di una possibile fuga, anche quando si scoloriscono è difficile staccarle quasi fossero una via di evasione alla quale ci dispiace rinunciare anche per il tempo di un fuggevole sguardo.Le stampe sono a tiratura limitata 1000 formato 15×20 ogni foto ha il timbro a secco, sono stampate su carta epson matte heavyweight con inchiostri claria che garantiscono una durata di circa 90 anni (fonte epson/WIR_EpR380_2006_11_29.pdf) Moleskine series: Sono dei piccoli album montati su Moleskine Sketchbook formato 5″x8¼” inches – 13x21cm, che uso anche per catalogare le foto originali contengono 50 stampe inkjet stampate su carta Hahnemühle FineArt Baryta formato 10x13cm,  stampate da  Soluzione Arte a Roma, le foto sono rimovibili in modo da poterle utilizzare singolarmente o per cambiare la sequenza della storia che segue un percorso cronologico.Cosa si riceve:1€: I miei sinceri ringraziamenti!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Kimberly and I am an author of<a href=""http://www.kimberlyhargraves.com/Store/Books.aspx"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> 30 plus books</a>. I am a <a href=""https://www.republishing.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">publisher </a>and <a href=""http://www.rejoiceessential.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">magazine</a> editor. Writing is my passion and it's very therapeutic. I have been through many storms in life such as having anxiety for five years, being suicidal, getting evicted, and being on probation for three years. Writing books helps me stay sane. I came from humble beginnings and hit rock bottom before. I could've been dead or in jail but I gave my life to Jesus. From there, I had a reason not to commit suicide and encourage others who were chronically depressed like I was. </p>
<p>My stories bring hope and restoration to many.  So many people have testified that my books have helped them in their darkest hour. My books have caused doors to open. I have been able to travel to share my story.  Recently, I wrote a screenplay for my book, ""The Pastor's Secret"" and a short film about marriage. </p>

<p>I would love for my books to be turned into films. Some people will never read a book but they will watch a film. I want my message to reach as many people as possible. That's where you come in. You can help us get the equipment that we need to start filming. You can partner with me as we impact lives together. We have the talent but we need you to believe in us and give us an opportunity by investing in the vision. I live by faith so anything will help. I live a life of service. From sun up to sun down, I constantly give of myself to those who are hurting from the trials in life.</p>
<p>My husband is skilled in <a href=""https://www.tronmosesmedia.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">videography, photography, and media</a>. He works really hard to help my vision. He studies his craft so he can put out excellence. He always encourages me to go higher. Together we can put together a beautiful film. </p>

<h3>Plan</h3>
<p>If we don't reach our goals, then I will still buy some equipment based on the amount raised. Anything is better than nothing.  </p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Years ago I was on a dark path. I was suicidal and depressed, I was arrested, and while in jail, I picked up a book that changed my life. It gave me hope to live again and to forgive myself. From that moment on, I passed what was imparted into me from that book to others. Many have testified how my books, blogs, magazine, and my story has inspired them. I desire to take some of my books to the next level by producing them into films and movies. As many people as possible need to hear this message especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many are grieving and feel weary. Encouragement and inspiration to continue on their journey despite the trials can brighten their day. I know that my assignment on this earth is bigger than me. That's why I consistently serve others with my gifts and talents and uplift those around me.</p>
</div><div>

My name is Kimberly and I am an author of 30 plus books. I am a publisher and magazine editor. Writing is my passion and it's very therapeutic. I have been through many storms in life such as having anxiety for five years, being suicidal, getting evicted, and being on probation for three years. Writing books helps me stay sane. I came from humble beginnings and hit rock bottom before. I could've been dead or in jail but I gave my life to Jesus. From there, I had a reason not to commit suicide and encourage others who were chronically depressed like I was. 
My stories bring hope and restoration to many.  So many people have testified that my books have helped them in their darkest hour. My books have caused doors to open. I have been able to travel to share my story.  Recently, I wrote a screenplay for my book, ""The Pastor's Secret"" and a short film about marriage. 

I would love for my books to be turned into films. Some people will never read a book but they will watch a film. I want my message to reach as many people as possible. That's where you come in. You can help us get the equipment that we need to start filming. You can partner with me as we impact lives together. We have the talent but we need you to believe in us and give us an opportunity by investing in the vision. I live by faith so anything will help. I live a life of service. From sun up to sun down, I constantly give of myself to those who are hurting from the trials in life.
My husband is skilled in videography, photography, and media. He works really hard to help my vision. He studies his craft so he can put out excellence. He always encourages me to go higher. Together we can put together a beautiful film. 

What We Need & What You Get
Funding
The goal is to raise $20,000 to get all equipment and to pay taxes and fees.
Equipment
Here is the list of the equipment that we are hoping to purchase with your support.
Two Cameras: Panasonic Lumix S1H 
We need two to capture different angles.

 
Mic: Sennheiser MKH-416 

- Pressure gradient receiver with a short interference tube
- Hyper-cardioid at low and medium frequency
- Above 2kHz approaches lobar pattern


Mic: Rode Blimp Windshield 
We need the best mics to reduce background noise and the wind

Light: Dracast LED2000 Kala Bi-color LED 3 light Kit 
We need to have a great lighting system to make our films pop

Two Lens: Panasonic Lumix SPRO 24-70mm F/2-8 L Mount Lens
We need the sharpest lens possible to produce high-quality films.

Editing And Production Cost: 
We have to invest in music, editing software, the location, crew, any extra equipment or accessories such as (batteries, chargers, SD cards, storage), talent, amount of pre-production, post-production, and more.
Here are some of the perks:

A signed copy of The Pastor's Secret Book: Prepare to take a journey as you read this exhilarating tale. 

PDF of Short Film: You get the PDF of the first short film that we will shoot. The short film is about a couple having marital and financial problems. Things go from bad to worse. Will their marriage survive? This film provides hope and inspiration.

Plan
If we don't reach our goals, then I will still buy some equipment based on the amount raised. Anything is better than nothing.  
The Impact
Years ago I was on a dark path. I was suicidal and depressed, I was arrested, and while in jail, I picked up a book that changed my life. It gave me hope to live again and to forgive myself. From that moment on, I passed what was imparted into me from that book to others. Many have testified how my books, blogs, magazine, and my story has inspired them. I desire to take some of my books to the next level by producing them into films and movies. As many people as possible need to hear this message especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many are grieving and feel weary. Encouragement and inspiration to continue on their journey despite the trials can brighten their day. I know that my assignment on this earth is bigger than me. That's why I consistently serve others with my gifts and talents and uplift those around me.

Risks & Challenges
There is a short window to raise all the necessary funds to film/produce this short film. There is a possiblity that all the funds wouldn't be raised. However, I will what funds that have been raised and buy whatever equipment I can. Instead of buying two cameras and lens, I will get one of each. My husband and I are training in film developing so we can keep our budget as possible. Together we can produce and edit a great film by ourselves if we don't raise the funds to hire help or an expert. 
Even in the COVID-19 Pandemic, we will take safety measures while filming. We must continue to work because our vision is too great to put it on hold. We will start casting roles once the equipment is obtained and start production soon after.

This makes FlashQ compatible with most camera and Flash brands.Behind the ScenesFlashQ is the result of research and development by our leading engineering team in Hong Kong. We all share the mind: pushing the boundaries of innovation to create revolutionary products.

Miniaturized internal antenna design puts FlashQ to be the first Wireless Flash Trigger product of its size in the world. The size is small, and the signal is strong. FlashQ can provide reliable wireless flash triggering, at any angles.


Proprietary energy-efficient protocol enables FlashQ to be the device with low power and low latency radio. Therefore, FlashQ transmitter / receiver is just powered by a CR2302 coin battery with 180 days standby time.
