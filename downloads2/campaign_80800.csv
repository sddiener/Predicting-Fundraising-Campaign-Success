<h2>Luciano Lu - River of Cultures</h2>
<p>(Please scroll on video for more on my story and for audio samples of my music!)</p>
<p>(PORTUGUÊS - No terceiro video (acima) eu conto minha história inteiramente em Português!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Overview </h3>
<p>I am an independent musician and music educator in Canada. Originally from Brazil, I share my music with a passion for my home country's traditional cultural pool where a mix of Indigenous, West African and Mediterranean European influences merge into surprising uplifting manifestations. </p>
<p>I have been a freelancer/ contract worker both in the art education as well as in the performing arts sectors for over 17 years in Canada. This year's events have pushed artists all over the world to either transition into virtual economy or to forgo their art and look for labour jobs. As a musician and composer, recording my music is the foremost important step in this transition and the fact that I have the opportunity and time to do it now, makes me immensely grateful! With your support I am going to not only be able to pay for regular costs of editing and mastering this album, but also to take the whole project to the next level!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Where are the funds going?</h3>
<p>Total project budget: $15,000</p>
<p>Personal investment (inheritance): $7,500</p>
<p>Estimated Costs:</p>
<p>$4,000 recording assistance editing and mastering costs - (done remotely) </p>
<p>$3,500 going directly to invited (featured) artists and session musicians.</p>
<p>$3,000 towards my professional accordion (with a trade-in)</p>
<p>$2,000 for pressing 200 vinyls</p>
<p>$1,000 for merchandise and gifts costs</p>
<p>$1,000 in press and advertisements for the campaign and album launch. </p>
<p>8% of pledges goes to Indiegogo (transaction processing and hosting)</p>

<h3>Who are the musicians?</h3>
<p>In my musical journey I have met countless talented musicians of all walks of life, styles and cultural backgrounds. For several years I was immersed in the Brazilian percussion and world music scene in Toronto, Canada, and in this community I count with several mentors and talented friends who have influenced my path in major ways. One of my objectives with this album project is to feature some of these relationships in different tracks, creating a cross pollination of cultures and strengthening bonds in a time where the music community is devastated. Rather then having these artists help me with ""favours"", I would like to be able to offer them an honourable pay for their participation in my album project! Among those confirmed to be featured in this album are: Flavia Nascimento (Quebec/Belo horizonte), Alexandre Garnizé (Rio), Riquinho Fernandez (Quebec/João Pessoa), Maninho Costa (Toronto/Rio), Hassan El Hadi (Toronto/Marrakesh), Sergio Chocolate (Toronto/Recife), Chris Butcher (New Orleans/Toronto) Jean François Lapierre (Gatineau, QC), Wise Atangana (Ottawa/ Cameroon), Andy Gamper ""Red Lion"" (Huntsville, ON), Bill McBirnie (Toronto). </p>

<h3>Who is my producer?</h3>
<p>Six years ago I had the rare chance to record one song with a phenomenal musician, multi-instrumentalist and producer from the North East of Brazil, Betinho Muniz (titled ""Poder da Graça"" on videos above). Since then I have been dreaming of doing a full album with him!! Now that independent music education contractors and performers like me are but stalled, and everything has gone remote, I am jumping on this chance to record over distance, and in fact we have already started! With Betinho Muniz on board there's no waiting around, he works fast and gets things done! That is why I know the album is coming one way or another!</p>

<h2>Hi folks!</h2> <p>I am fundraising to give YOU the opportunity of a lifetime to come with me into a 'famous northwest London recording studio' and make a Christmas Record with me as part of my choir!</p> <h3>The amazing thing about this is:</h3>

<p>- You don't need to be able to act</p>
<p>- You don't even have to be there in person</p>- <span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">AND MOST OF ALL, you cannot get into this particular studio for love nor money without being there on recording business.

<p>- IN THE MUSIC VIDEO we will shoot on the day in the iconic and highly recognisable studio room</p> <h3>And you will get:</h3>
<p>- A christmas hat to keep (wearing it in the video is mandatory ;))</p>
<p>- Lunch in the studio canteen (you never know who might be around)</p>
<p>- An entire afternoon at the studio recording, filming, being photographed, followed by drinks</p>
<p>- Professional pictures of you in the famous studio room, and in front of the entrance to the studio to keep</p> <p>If you are international: I will post you the same hat, and want you to send in a pic or short video of you (or your cat) in it, and we will edit it into the video so it will be as if you are with us on the day!</p>

<p>You. For music fans, for history fans, for people who want to support my music and have fun at the same time. For people coming as a family, with friends, or solo supporters - you will all be made very welcome and led through the day by my coordinator. For people who want a day they will never forget, and a video to prove it!

<p>Singer-songwriter Timothy Cloverleaf (aka Timothy Cloherty)
is an accomplished songwriter and producer having performed on the Conan O'Brien
Show and had music videos on MTV. He has music with both SONY Music publishing
and RONDOR Publishing and has recorded albums and EP's with ALMO Sounds
(Geffen) and HiFi Recordings. </p>
<p>After having toured North America and the UK with The Rake's

started other projects including then bands Booga Sugar and 50 Shades of
Green. </p>
<p>Weaving traditional folk instruments with his pop
sensibilities he crafts his songs into beautifully sad stories that you can
sing along and dance to. </p>

   What I Need & What You Get
The home studio is good for some of the demoing and even some of the overdubs but studio time in a professional recording studio is expensive between 500 and 1000 per day. I'll be looking to find the best deals and rates I can find to keep the costs within my budget. I'll be looking to get a studio for 500/day.
After the original studio tracking sessions I'll be working for the most part in the home studio for overdubbing where necessary. I'll need about 4500 for extra studio time and upgrades to get this sounding as professional as possible. 
Mixing will be about 100/day and about a day per song. I'll be hoping to have between 13 and 16 songs for the album. So somewhere between 1300 and 1600.
CD post production and duplication will cost around 2900 for the first 1000 CD's and that will include digitally downloadable MP3's from various music download sites in perpetuity. 
WHAT YOU GET... are my beautiful songs available for your listening pleasure! Plus all donors will be thanked in the liner notes of the physical CD art work. (And you'll have that warm hearted feeling of philanthropic pleasure for your generous gift that will last you till the next world). AND I've arranged for a few perks.
    The Impact People around the world will be able to listen to these wondrously enchanting songs eventually enlightening the masses to bring about global euphoria. Especially if we can get beyond the CD and duplication phase and into radio promotion!
    Challenges As funding comes in I will chip away at the demos and early recordings for the album and start rehearsals for the special guest musicians and singers. I expect that it will take approximately 2 months to finish recording the tracks and another few weeks for post production and CD duplication. After that there will be time to start getting promotional materials together and get started on publicity and maybe even radio promo! 
I have opted in to inDemand so if I raise over the amount necessary to finish the recordings I will put the extra monies toward promotion and publicity.

Attention to detail, especially from a songwriting sense was imperative. All of us involved in Mark Pontin Group work full time as musicians. But not full time in Mark Pontin Group solely. To fund recording albums, touring and promotion we work hard playing weddings, functions, cabaret and anything musical we can do.

We need the gigs to sell the CD's. We need them to raise our profile. But we need a raised profile to get the gigs.</p><p>One way to attempt to combat this is to use PR. A good PR firm with good contacts can get magazine interviews, radio play, newspaper articles etc. </p><p>But, you guessed it, this costs money.</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">So as an up and coming band, we need to -</span><br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Fund our equipment, transport, websites, promo, rehearsals, advertising, recording costs, video costs, cd duplication, artwork,touring costs etc and now... PR too.</p><p><br/></p><p>So we have worked hard to pay for all the above, with the exception of PR. </p><p>Our resources are exhausted, even Mark's beloved 1961 SG Reissue was pawned to pay for extra studio time for Textures. Yes, harsh reality! Ironically Mark was recognised in the Cash Generator queue...</p><p><br/></p><p>If this was a 'Dragons Den' type scenario our investment would be all of the above. We have brought you a great first album, which many people have enjoyed on Spotify (10,000 plays and counting) and at our shows. Trouble is, Spotify and similar pay us just $18 for those plays, and the gigs usually cost us money right now too.</p><p><br/></p><p>With your help we can change that. With your added investment, we can push the new album 'Textures' out into the greater musical world, to gain the exposure that would push the band to the next level, allowing it to be self sustaining, allowing the shows to progress and allowing us to reach new audiences too.</p><p>So why should you invest in us? Your hard earned money is just as important? Too right! We agree 100%. </p><p>For us we believe that 'Textures' NEEDS to be heard en masse. For all fans of blues rock, guitar and good songs. We wrote the album as if it was something WE would buy and cherish. Its done with a nod to some great albums of the past, and in a way that albums used to be made. Albums used to be ART. All too often these days, you get GREAT guitar players, and not so great songs. Or GREAT songs but poor production. Or GREAT guitar,songs, but poor vocals. As a band we have collectively listened to hundreds of thousands of hours of GREAT music, and our goal was to utilise some of the ingredients of those great albums into 'Textures'.</p><p>We made sure the songs were crafted and presented well. There isn't a weak song on the album. Every one has its own merits.</p><p>We made sure we have several radio friendly songs, with big hooks, but still blues rock. </p><p>We made sure the production is top notch, maintained a traditional feel, but is contemporary and would appeal to fans new and old.</p><p>We made sure only the best takes made it through. We spent our money ( and pawned our instruments ) to get more time in the studio to get it just so.</p><p>We made sure the artwork is ART work. All done in house, all pictures, design everything.</p><p>So have a listen to our preview video. Its 12 minutes long, I know, but if you're thinking of investing, you need to KNOW, right?</p><p>We are not asking for a fortune. Just a little boost to help us out. £1500 is our goal, and if we get more then great.</p><p><br/></p><p>The money will be used to promote Textures via PR. This will raise awareness of us, the album, the songs etc. With this profile raising we can secure more decent work, further advance the band along the road to becoming a self sustaining unit that doesn't have to pawn their instruments, or doesn't have to 'go on after the purple monsters' at caravan parks ( as useful as they have been..).</p><p>You also get a hand in pushing some great music, and you get the just deserved feeling of satisfaction that you contributed whole heartedly to this.</p><p><br/></p><p>But wait, we don't want your money for nothing ( or your chicks for free...). No,no,no..</p><p>You can blag yourself a whole load of EXCLUSIVE goodies, including some prized instruments, guitar lessons, show tickets etc etc. CHECK THEM OUT !!!

A good PR firm with good contacts can get magazine interviews, radio play, newspaper articles etc. But, you guessed it, this costs money.So as an up and coming band, we need to -Fund our equipment, transport, websites, promo, rehearsals, advertising, recording costs, video costs, cd duplication, artwork,touring costs etc and now... PR too.So we have worked hard to pay for all the above, with the exception of PR. Our resources are exhausted, even Mark's beloved 1961 SG Reissue was pawned to pay for extra studio time for Textures. Yes, harsh reality! Ironically Mark was recognised in the Cash Generator queue...If this was a 'Dragons Den' type scenario our investment would be all of the above. We have brought you a great first album, which many people have enjoyed on Spotify (10,000 plays and counting) and at our shows. Trouble is, Spotify and similar pay us just $18 for those plays, and the gigs usually cost us money right now too.With your help we can change that. With your added investment, we can push the new album 'Textures' out into the greater musical world, to gain the exposure that would push the band to the next level, allowing it to be self sustaining, allowing the shows to progress and allowing us to reach new audiences too.So why should you invest in us? Your hard earned money is just as important? Too right! We agree 100%. For us we believe that 'Textures' NEEDS to be heard en masse. For all fans of blues rock, guitar and good songs. We wrote the album as if it was something WE would buy and cherish. Its done with a nod to some great albums of the past, and in a way that albums used to be made. Albums used to be ART. All too often these days, you get GREAT guitar players, and not so great songs. Or GREAT songs but poor production. Or GREAT guitar,songs, but poor vocals. As a band we have collectively listened to hundreds of thousands of hours of GREAT music, and our goal was to utilise some of the ingredients of those great albums into 'Textures'.We made sure the songs were crafted and presented well. There isn't a weak song on the album. Every one has its own merits.We made sure we have several radio friendly songs, with big hooks, but still blues rock. We made sure the production is top notch, maintained a traditional feel, but is contemporary and would appeal to fans new and old.We made sure only the best takes made it through. We spent our money ( and pawned our instruments ) to get more time in the studio to get it just so.We made sure the artwork is ART work. All done in house, all pictures, design everything.So have a listen to our preview video. Its 12 minutes long, I know, but if you're thinking of investing, you need to KNOW, right?We are not asking for a fortune. Just a little boost to help us out. £1500 is our goal, and if we get more then great.The money will be used to promote Textures via PR. This will raise awareness of us, the album, the songs etc. With this profile raising we can secure more decent work, further advance the band along the road to becoming a self sustaining unit that doesn't have to pawn their instruments, or doesn't have to 'go on after the purple monsters' at caravan parks ( as useful as they have been..).You also get a hand in pushing some great music, and you get the just deserved feeling of satisfaction that you contributed whole heartedly to this.But wait, we don't want your money for nothing ( or your chicks for free...). No,no,no..You can blag yourself a whole load of EXCLUSIVE goodies, including some prized instruments, guitar lessons, show tickets etc etc. CHECK THEM OUT !!! You won't be able to get these offers anywhere else...For more band info or if you would like to contact us go to www.markpontingroup.comTHANK YOU !!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</div><p></p><h3>Background</h3><h4>You know <i>The Messiah</i>. But do you know The Christmas Story? The Baroque master Heinrich Schütz wrote a Christmas tale of unsurpassed beauty, and we've got a production that brings it to life.<br/><br/>
</h4><div>
<p><b>The Plan</b><br/>On December 26, <a href=""http://theweckmannproject.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Weckmann Project</a>, <a href=""http://musicanuova.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Musica Nuova</a>, and <a href=""longandaway.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Long and Away</a> viol consort will perform the Schütz Christmas Story <i>(Weihnachtshistorie) </i>at First Church Cambridge, with music direction by <a href=""http://www.jeffreygrossman.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jeffrey Grossman</a> and stage direction by <a href=""http://www.juliamintzer.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Julia Mintzer</a>. This beautiful work is not often performed due to the varied instruments required and the difficulties of engaging an English-speaking audience with a German-language work. </p>
<p><b>We will show you a Christmas Story full of theater. </b>Our staging brings out the universal human experiences of this tale: birth, fear, joy, death, promise. At our first collaboration in 2014, some 300 people from diverse backgrounds joined us. In fact, our children's concert was so popular that kids and families are again welcome to this year's afternoon performance - and <b><a href=""https://www.artful.ly/events/4028"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">children under 10 are free</a></b>!</p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>This campaign<b> directly supports fees for artists, </b>who are taking pains during the holiday season to devote the time and care that this complex production requires.</p>
<p><b>We are keeping ticket prices low </b>to welcome families and as many people as possible to this rarely-heard masterpiece. But it's a <b>financial risk</b> for our companies, and it means we must turn to you to help make this production possible. In return, please enjoy one of our <b>musical perks</b> - and more! - as thank you gifts. </p>
<p>What if we don't make our goal? Liza and Amanda will waive their fees to pay the 30+ other artists involved. But if we exceed our goal and<b> hit $7,000, Liza will dress up like Schütz and serenade passersby in Davis Square</b> - that's priceless!</p>

<div>* PS, it's true, <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-schutz-bucket-challenge/x/525125#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">last year</a> we were calling this The Christmas Oratorio. It's the same work, but The Christmas Story is more true to the original title.</div>
<p></p>
</div><p></p></div>","BackgroundYou know The Messiah. But do you know The Christmas Story? The Baroque master Heinrich Schütz wrote a Christmas tale of unsurpassed beauty, and we've got a production that brings it to life.

The PlanOn December 26, The Weckmann Project, Musica Nuova, and Long and Away viol consort will perform the Schütz Christmas Story (Weihnachtshistorie) at First Church Cambridge, with music direction by Jeffrey Grossman and stage direction by Julia Mintzer. This beautiful work is not often performed due to the varied instruments required and the difficulties of engaging an English-speaking audience with a German-language work. 
We will show you a Christmas Story full of theater. Our staging brings out the universal human experiences of this tale: birth, fear, joy, death, promise. At our first collaboration in 2014, some 300 people from diverse backgrounds joined us. In fact, our children's concert was so popular that kids and families are again welcome to this year's afternoon performance - and children under 10 are free!

What We Need & What You Get
This campaign directly supports fees for artists, who are taking pains during the holiday season to devote the time and care that this complex production requires.
We are keeping ticket prices low to welcome families and as many people as possible to this rarely-heard masterpiece. But it's a financial risk for our companies, and it means we must turn to you to help make this production possible. In return, please enjoy one of our musical perks - and more! - as thank you gifts. 
What if we don't make our goal? Liza and Amanda will waive their fees to pay the 30+ other artists involved. But if we exceed our goal and hit $7,000, Liza will dress up like Schütz and serenade passersby in Davis Square - that's priceless!

<p>The Minidoka Swing Band (MSB) is under the umbrella of the
Portland Japanese American Citizen's League (JACL) which preserves the culture
and values of Japanese Americans and develops understanding between all social
and ethnic groups.  The Minidoka Swing Band and its educational message
represents all Americans. Our planning team has already put in almost two years
of planning to secure our Japanese venues and plan the itinerary.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Contributors
to our campaign will help our volunteer musicians with the $100,000 expense of
traveling to and staying in Japan while we share WWII Japanese American history
with the Japanese. We
want to help Japanese citizens
understand the suffering that Japanese
Americans endured during WWII when they were imprisoned behind barbed wire in
isolated incarceration sites surrounded by armed guards. Despite this unjust incarceration of parents and families,
young Japanese American men felt the ambivalent
compulsion to choose between their ancestral country and their new homeland.
Many chose to enlist in the American military, serving with distinction in the
100th Infantry Battalion, the 442nd Regimental Combat Team and the 522nd Field
Artillery Battalion. Education and awareness is the best way to prevent this
type of imprisoned injustice, “hard choices” and the other tragedies of war
from recurring in the future. <span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>                         </span></p>

<p>We need your support and donations! The
Minidoka Swing Band and its 23 members is composed entirely of volunteers who donate their
valuable time and talent to share the history of WWII Japanese American
Incarceration through music of the era and music that was popular inside the
incarceration camps and played by imprisoned internees. Your donation to our educational tour throughout Japan will help
all band members cover the cost of transportation and lodging in Japan. 70% of our band members are over 65 or retired. Four families in the band have 2-4 family members that are musicians in the
band.</p>
<p>Our hosts in Japan will be donating the venue sites for
our performances and the Minidoka Swing Band will receive no compensation for their performances in Japan. With your help we will be able to cover our expenses for airfare,
lodging, meals and transportation while in Japan so that we can share our educational mission statement.  </p>
<p>We all know that the citizens of Japan suffered greatly during
WWII and we want to share with them that Japanese Americans suffered as well. We are the last  surviving generation that has had personal experience inside the incarceration camps. </p>
<p>Three of our Minidoka Swing Band members were actually imprisoned during WWII when they were young, along with their families.  Our band leader, Larry Nobori, a retired music instructor from the Portland School District and an accomplished classical and jazz musician was incarcerated as a baby in  the Jerome Relocation Center. O<span>ur lead female vocalist, Nola Sugai Bogle, was incarcerated in the Minidoka Relocation Center as a young child and o</span><span>ur lead male vocalist, Henry ""Shig""
Sakamoto was incarcerated as a teenager in the Minidoka Relocation Center.
 Many of our other band members had parents, grandparents and other family
members imprisoned in several other incarceration sites around the USA. </span><span style='color: rgb(106, 106, 106); letter-spacing: 0px; font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'></span></p>

<p><strong>On February 19, 2011 the Minidoka Swing Band was honored to play at the Oregon Nikkei Endowment reception for ""An Intimate Dinner with George Takei"" at the Portland Marriott Downtown Waterfront Hotel. I have included a very nice email I received from Mr. Takei regarding the evening:</strong></p>
<p><i>""Dear Laura,</i></p>
<p><i>I was transported to my boyhood imprisoned in two U.S. internment camps at that memorable evening (two weekends ago) at the reception for the Oregon Nikkei Endowment. Our barrack was just across the way from the mess hall at both camps. So, one of my cherished memories from those years is that of the music that wafted over on Saturday nights from the mess hall after my mother put us to bed.</i></p>
<p><i>The music of the 40’s that I heard from the Minidoka Swing Band sounded so familiar and sweet. That was the music of my boyhood. That was the sound that I loved. And it was brought back to me so marvelously that evening in Portland. My appreciation and gratitude goes to those talented musicians for keeping a dulcet part of a dark experience so melodically alive.</i></p>
<p><i>My thanks to you and the talented musicians for the great work that you are doing.</i></p>
<p><i>Warm regards,</i></p>

<p><span style=""line-height: 30px; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;"">The Impact: </span></p>
<p>Our project will use music, pictures and narration to help everyone understand and remember the injustices of the Japanese American Incarceration during WWII.</p>
<p>The Minidoka Swing Band has performed throughout Oregon and Washington and we would like to reach out to other citizens of the world who were also deeply affected by the tragic events of WWII.  We want to prevent any group of people from suffering and being unfairly imprisoned because of prejudice, discrimination, and war hysteria.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 30px; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;"">Who is our band?</span><br/></p>
<p>The Minidoka Swing Band consists of 17 musicians and 4 vocalists who play and sing such big band tunes as “All of Me,"" “American Patrol,"" ""Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy,"" “Moonlight Serenade,"" “Sentimental Journey,"" “Tuxedo Junction,""  and many more. </p>

<p>In 1942, President Roosevelt signed
Executive Order No. 9066, and between 110,000 and 120,000 Americans of Japanese
heritage who lived on the West Coast of the United States were given one week’s
notice to leave their homes, businesses and possessions.
Japanese Americans spent almost four years behind barbed wire; armed guards in
towers ensured that prisoners did not escape. The Band shares this history through the big band swing music that was popular
at that time. This music was played inside the camps by some professional and non-professional
musicians who where incarcerated, mostly young teens. As quoted
by 91-year-old George Tsugawa, a former
prisoner at the Minidoka Incarceration Camp, <i>“Every weekend we
looked forward to the music and dancing. We loved to swing dance
and loved the music and loved the socialization it afforded us. It gave us
something to look forward to and took our minds off our living
situation. Your band brings back such wonderful memories of a bad place.”</i></p>

Minidoka Swing Band Japan Tour                              PO Box 86310                                                       Portland, OR  97286
In observance of the 70th anniversary of the end of WWII, the all-volunteer and not-for-profit Minidoka Swing Band will be performing a concert tour in Japan November 6-16, 2015. We will be sharing an important part of Japanese American history through educational narration, pictures and music to the cities of Tokyo, Yokohama, Iwaki-city, Minamisoma, Gotemba and more.

Based in Portland, Oregon, the Minidoka Swing Band educates and preserves an important period of Japanese American history. Through our music we reach out to groups and organizations and share what the people of Japanese ancestry on the west coast of the U.S.A. endured during WWII.






The Minidoka Swing Band (MSB) is under the umbrella of the
Portland Japanese American Citizen's League (JACL) which preserves the culture
and values of Japanese Americans and develops understanding between all social
and ethnic groups.  The Minidoka Swing Band and its educational message
represents all Americans. Our planning team has already put in almost two years
of planning to secure our Japanese venues and plan the itinerary.

Contributors
to our campaign will help our volunteer musicians with the $100,000 expense of
traveling to and staying in Japan while we share WWII Japanese American history
with the Japanese. We
want to help Japanese citizens
understand the suffering that Japanese
Americans endured during WWII when they were imprisoned behind barbed wire in
isolated incarceration sites surrounded by armed guards. Despite this unjust incarceration of parents and families,
young Japanese American men felt the ambivalent
compulsion to choose between their ancestral country and their new homeland.
Many chose to enlist in the American military, serving with distinction in the
100th Infantry Battalion, the 442nd Regimental Combat Team and the 522nd Field
Artillery Battalion. Education and awareness is the best way to prevent this
type of imprisoned injustice, “hard choices” and the other tragedies of war
from recurring in the future.                          
           
What We Need:

 
We need your support and donations! The
Minidoka Swing Band and its 23 members is composed entirely of volunteers who donate their
valuable time and talent to share the history of WWII Japanese American
Incarceration through music of the era and music that was popular inside the
incarceration camps and played by imprisoned internees. Your donation to our educational tour throughout Japan will help
all band members cover the cost of transportation and lodging in Japan. 70% of our band members are over 65 or retired. Four families in the band have 2-4 family members that are musicians in the
band.
Our hosts in Japan will be donating the venue sites for
our performances and the Minidoka Swing Band will receive no compensation for their performances in Japan. With your help we will be able to cover our expenses for airfare,
lodging, meals and transportation while in Japan so that we can share our educational mission statement.  
We all know that the citizens of Japan suffered greatly during
WWII and we want to share with them that Japanese Americans suffered as well. We are the last  surviving generation that has had personal experience inside the incarceration camps. 
Three of our Minidoka Swing Band members were actually imprisoned during WWII when they were young, along with their families.  Our band leader, Larry Nobori, a retired music instructor from the Portland School District and an accomplished classical and jazz musician was incarcerated as a baby in  the Jerome Relocation Center. Our lead female vocalist, Nola Sugai Bogle, was incarcerated in the Minidoka Relocation Center as a young child and our lead male vocalist, Henry ""Shig""
Sakamoto was incarcerated as a teenager in the Minidoka Relocation Center.
 Many of our other band members had parents, grandparents and other family
members imprisoned in several other incarceration sites around the USA. 

                                                       WWII Japanese American Relocation Camps.

On February 19, 2011 the Minidoka Swing Band was honored to play at the Oregon Nikkei Endowment reception for ""An Intimate Dinner with George Takei"" at the Portland Marriott Downtown Waterfront Hotel. I have included a very nice email I received from Mr. Takei regarding the evening:
""Dear Laura,
I was transported to my boyhood imprisoned in two U.S. internment camps at that memorable evening (two weekends ago) at the reception for the Oregon Nikkei Endowment. Our barrack was just across the way from the mess hall at both camps. So, one of my cherished memories from those years is that of the music that wafted over on Saturday nights from the mess hall after my mother put us to bed.
The music of the 40’s that I heard from the Minidoka Swing Band sounded so familiar and sweet. That was the music of my boyhood. That was the sound that I loved. And it was brought back to me so marvelously that evening in Portland. My appreciation and gratitude goes to those talented musicians for keeping a dulcet part of a dark experience so melodically alive.
My thanks to you and the talented musicians for the great work that you are doing.
Warm regards,
George Takei                                                                                                  http://www.georgetakei.com/

The Impact: 
Our project will use music, pictures and narration to help everyone understand and remember the injustices of the Japanese American Incarceration during WWII.
The Minidoka Swing Band has performed throughout Oregon and Washington and we would like to reach out to other citizens of the world who were also deeply affected by the tragic events of WWII.  We want to prevent any group of people from suffering and being unfairly imprisoned because of prejudice, discrimination, and war hysteria.  

Who is our band?
The Minidoka Swing Band consists of 17 musicians and 4 vocalists who play and sing such big band tunes as “All of Me,"" “American Patrol,"" ""Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy,"" “Moonlight Serenade,"" “Sentimental Journey,"" “Tuxedo Junction,""  and many more. 

  
We play at celebrations, festivals, libraries, conferences, remembrances, weddings, concerts in the park and at many other venues across the Pacific Northwest. The Band operates entirely on donations, honorariums from performances, and some grants. Our musicians range in age from 16 to 88 yrs. old. Resources are spent for practice space, equipment, music, and minimal travel reimbursements.

     

The Minidoka Swing Band has been recognized by TV, magazine and newspapers.  Stories and articles have included the front page of the Wall Street Journal (New York), an Emmy - nominated story by KING TV5 Evening Magazine Program (Seattle, Washington), the National Newspaper of the JACL Pacific Citizen (Los Angeles, California), and many more local newspapers around the Portland - metro area. Two of the Minidoka Swing Band’s musical recordings were used in the nationally broadcasted documentary about music in the WWII Incarceration camps, “Searchlight Serenade,” produced by KEET - TV Public Broadcasting (Eureka, California)

<h3>Why Opera NEO is Important to my Growth</h3>
<div>This summer I have the incredible opportunity to return to Opera NEO, an operatic training program, in San Diego, California. While there last year I was able to participate in performances of the Magic Flute as Papageno, sing in the Cabaret night and most importantly study with voice teacher Braeden Harris. As many of you know last summer was important to me because that was when I made the decision to switch to tenor. I can say with certainty that without the help of the staff at Opera NEO I would not have had the same level of success that I am having today. That being said, I still have a long way to go in solidifying my ""new voice."" I very much believe that returning to Opera NEO this summer is going to get me to where I need to be vocally. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<h3>Information about the Recital</h3>
<div>
<p>Join Daveed and pianist Michal Schmidt for an afternoon vocal recital to help him raise money to attend Opera NEO this summer. </p>
<p>The program will be Deux Melodies Hebraïques by Ravel, 6 Songs from a Shropshire Lad by George Butterworth, L'horizon Chimerique by Fauré and Dichterliebe by Schumann</p>
<p>Rebecca Ergas has graciously let us use her house for the recital. The address is 346 Wyldhaven
Rd. Bryn Mawr PA 19010 and will be held on on
Sunday July 12<sup>th</sup> at 2:00 PM. </p>
</div>
<h3>What is Opera NEO?</h3> <p>Opera NEO is an up and coming young artist program based in San Diego, California. They have offered me unique opportunities to:</p> <ul> <li>Perform the role of Vogelsang in Mozart's ""Impresario"" </li> <li>Participate in masterclasses and professional development workshops </li> <li>And most importantly my continued studies with voice teacher Braeden Harris who was instrumental in my recent switch to Tenor repertoire. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<div>I was fortunate enough to attend Opera NEO last year where I was able to sing the role of Papageno in Mozart's ""The Magic Flute"" and study with voice teacher Braeden Harris. While there I was able to work with a highly supportive team of professional musicians who were both knowledgable and professionally connected. This year I hope to strengthen these relationships and:</div>
<div><br/></div> <ul>
<li>Identify and refine my new tenor audition repertoire.</li> <li>Continue to gain positive ground in my transition to Tenor.</li> <li>Strengthen my stage craft through opportunities in the main stage operas, cabaret performances and outreach performances.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Donations</h3> <p>Although Opera NEO provides professional standard performances it is first and foremost a training program and therefore has expenses associated with it. 
There is no fixed admission fee for the performance but there is a
suggested minimum donation of $50 per group. However, donations of any quantity
will be accepted and much appreciated. Those who are unable to attend the recital but donate $25-$50 will receive a recording of Dichterliebe and those who donate $50 or more will receive a recording of the entire recital. The donations will go to cover the costs of:</p> <ul> <li>Opera NEO Tuition</li>
<li>Cover recital expenses </li>
<li>Air Fare </li>
<li>Dining Expenses</li> </ul> </div> <p>Thank you all so much for your time, I really hope you all can attend! </p><p><br/></p><p>-Daveed</p></div>","Why Opera NEO is Important to my Growth

The program will be Deux Melodies Hebraïques by Ravel, 6 Songs from a Shropshire Lad by George Butterworth, L'horizon Chimerique by Fauré and Dichterliebe by Schumann
Rebecca Ergas has graciously let us use her house for the recital. The address is 346 Wyldhaven
Rd. Bryn Mawr PA 19010 and will be held on on
Sunday July 12th at 2:00 PM. 

What is Opera NEO? Opera NEO is an up and coming young artist program based in San Diego, California. They have offered me unique opportunities to:  Perform the role of Vogelsang in Mozart's ""Impresario""  Participate in masterclasses and professional development workshops  And most importantly my continued studies with voice teacher Braeden Harris who was instrumental in my recent switch to Tenor repertoire. 


    The Impact
I was fortunate enough to attend Opera NEO last year where I was able to sing the role of Papageno in Mozart's ""The Magic Flute"" and study with voice teacher Braeden Harris. While there I was able to work with a highly supportive team of professional musicians who were both knowledgable and professionally connected. This year I hope to strengthen these relationships and:
 
Identify and refine my new tenor audition repertoire. Continue to gain positive ground in my transition to Tenor. Strengthen my stage craft through opportunities in the main stage operas, cabaret performances and outreach performances.


    Donations Although Opera NEO provides professional standard performances it is first and foremost a training program and therefore has expenses associated with it. 
There is no fixed admission fee for the performance but there is a
suggested minimum donation of $50 per group. However, donations of any quantity
will be accepted and much appreciated. Those who are unable to attend the recital but donate $25-$50 will receive a recording of Dichterliebe and those who donate $50 or more will receive a recording of the entire recital. The donations will go to cover the costs of:  Opera NEO Tuition

</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And if you're wondering where this money is mostly likely going (whether we hit our goal or not), we can pretty much assure you it's a gas tank.  We recently purchased a 1995 Ford E-350 diesel shuttle bus (see excited Phil and Jonny with Delores in photo above).  Filling that up is going to be soooo much fun!  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>If you know what crowd funding is, feel free to skip this paragraph.  Our perks are to the right.  If you don't, it's simple.  We are asking for a donation from you, and the more you give the more you get in return from us.  You can contribute as little as $1 and we won't complain.  Every dollar counts.  You can also donate $2,500.  We will definitely not complain there either.  For $1 you get our new single INSTANTLY via email before it's official release.  Indiegogo has made it as easy as can be to share this page with all of your friends with their handy sharing tools you'll see on the page, so use 'em!  </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>And now for the perks! As you'll see to the right, <b>almost all of these perks stack</b>, so if you donate $10, you get a one of a kind acoustic EP, and the single.  If you donate $25 you get an exclusive shirt, the acoustic EP, and the single, and so on.  Some other cool stuff we're doing this time around include but are not limited to:</div>
<div>- Doing a shot of beer in honor of every name who donates and filiming the whole thing. Yep.  Every donation earned means this video will be a bit more hilarious. </div>

Did you enjoy the music video?  Cool.  We enjoyed making it!  Want our new song ""We Owe You The Truth"" FIRST for as little as $1?  Excellent.  Keep reading.Greetings.  We are the Small Town Titans, a hard rock power trio from York, PA, and we keep things simple.  We write songs by jamming in a basement together using guitars, drums, our voices, and occasionally the harmonica.  If we can't do it live at a show, we don't put it on a record.  We have been working hard saving all of our money earned from shows and merch sales for several years all over PA, NJ, MD, and VA.  We are ready to tour all over the USA and we are finally taking this next crucial step in our career.  There's one problem.  It's really, really expensive.  We're not kidding and we can prove it to you with spreadsheets.  Everyone loves spreadsheets.  But first here's a picture to show our excitement upon purchasing our baby, Delores, on 11/11/14 - National Metal Day \m/ \m/.  Ben couldn't make it because he was working.  Bummer.




 So, we aren't signed to a record label and we don't get any outside support financially whatsoever, except from what we receive from you, the fans.  We have saved as much money as humanly possible over the last three years in order to do this.  We are showing you, the fan, exactly what we need below.  We've even included links where we can to show you where we got our expense amounts from.  


And if you're wondering where this money is mostly likely going (whether we hit our goal or not), we can pretty much assure you it's a gas tank.  We recently purchased a 1995 Ford E-350 diesel shuttle bus (see excited Phil and Jonny with Delores in photo above).  Filling that up is going to be soooo much fun!  

If you know what crowd funding is, feel free to skip this paragraph.  Our perks are to the right.  If you don't, it's simple.  We are asking for a donation from you, and the more you give the more you get in return from us.  You can contribute as little as $1 and we won't complain.  Every dollar counts.  You can also donate $2,500.  We will definitely not complain there either.  For $1 you get our new single INSTANTLY via email before it's official release.  Indiegogo has made it as easy as can be to share this page with all of your friends with their handy sharing tools you'll see on the page, so use 'em!  

And now for the perks! As you'll see to the right, almost all of these perks stack, so if you donate $10, you get a one of a kind acoustic EP, and the single.  If you donate $25 you get an exclusive shirt, the acoustic EP, and the single, and so on.  Some other cool stuff we're doing this time around include but are not limited to:
- Doing a shot of beer in honor of every name who donates and filiming the whole thing. Yep.  Every donation earned means this video will be a bit more hilarious. 
- Selling a live acoustic EP exclusively through this campaign
- Exclusive t-shirts and hoodies with YOUR name and tour dates on the back (like THESE, see the side bar of perks for all the info):












- Show memorabilia (signed broken sticks, strings, drum heads, posters, etc.)


- Phil will give you a page from his journal (you've been warned)
- Jonny will make you a custom shirt like the ones he has been wearing recently at gigs
- Ben will draw you a flip book telling tales of the band (even WE can't wait to see these so DONATE!)
- We'll play in your living room
- We'll professionally record a song you wrote
- and of course MORE!

And now, the moment you've all been waiting for.  Spreadsheets.  Here's some screenshots of all the money we still need (oh joy!).  We've also included a link to this Excel spreadsheet so you can actually click the links within and see we are telling the truth!

Click HERE to see our full tour expenses spreadsheet.









Our last campaign for our record ""From Fight To Flight"" was a resounding success and we can't thank our fans enough for it.  We can only hope to hit our goal once again by giving back to you, the fan.  This dream ends before it even begins without every single last one of you.  We take pride in sharing our journey as a band with as many of you as we possibly can.  So let's do this together.  You help us and we will give you everything we can in return.  

So...Are You With Us?  Then spread the word using the hash tag #AreYouWithUs. If you scroll to the top of this page and click the gallery tab, you'll find official social media pics you can use to help spread the word about this campaign along with us. We'll see you on the road. :-)

</div><p></p><h3>Not just any EP...</h3><p>In 2009 I became a rapper. How do you become a rapper you ask? I really don't know the answer to that. You see in my case, I just borrowed the maiden name of my maternal grandmother and went around calling myself a rapper. Shortly after becoming a ""rapper"", I did what most people do… Just mimicked what I saw and heard. </p><p>I wrote lyrics. Book loads of them. I'd get rap instrumentals from anyone I could and I would spend hours and hours just writing lyrics under the streets of NYC while commuting to and from work on the subway. </p><p>Though, I genuinely enjoy all of the music I've ever made, something never felt quite right. I felt like I was putting on a bit of a character and trying to be like other rappers. During that time I was trying to find my sound and the only way I knew how to do it, was to mimic what I had heard other artists do.  6 years, 2 EP's &amp; 4 singles later I have finally found MY sound. I've started making a kind of music that is truer to me and to be completely honest, it's not really rap. I don't know exactly what it is, but I love it and I really can't wait to share it with you. </p><h3>How much do we need?</h3><h3>$5,000</h3><p>Your contribution will cover the costs associated with creating an extremely professional project in which you'll be able to say, ""I helped create that"".</p><p>Your currency will pay for: </p><p>Studio Time, Mixing, Mastering, Hiring local musicians (The magic), Album Art &amp; Digital distribution  for 3 well packaged tracks that will impact humanity.  </p><h3>Where is your money going?</h3><div>A bulk of the budget will go into production costs.

<p>Jason has worked extensively with 5 time Grammy nominated Tift Merritt (No relation). He Mixed Chatham County Line's record ""Wildwood"", Co produced recorded and mixed Six String Drag's record ""Roots Rock-n-roll"", Co produced, recorded and mixed Keny Roby's critically acclaimed record ""Memories and birds"", worked with Underhill Rose on 2 records and a lot of other things... He also recorded and mixed a track of Bloodshot Records 25th anniversary…To top it all off, he's been in sessions with Dr. Dre, Paul Westerberg and Courtney love.  Not only has he been successful behind the scenes pushing the record button, he has also shared the stage with Keny Roby while on a 2 week tour opening for Citizen Cope. </p>

<div>The use of real recorded instrumentation versus packaged (digital) sound  is incomparable.  Jason and I will be hand selecting local talent and paying them to come into the studio to record with us.  Think deep strings, cellos, percussion and local vocals.  I will be providing the mouth trumpet (just kidding we will not have any mouth trumpeting on this record.  Maybe next time).     </div>
<h3>Album Art  </h3>
<p>The album art for this record will be subtle, yet powerful and there is no better person to do it, than my good friend Jamie Makely.  Jamie is an amazing artist who I have been so fortunate to have on my side.  She designed art for my last EP, ""Till It's Over"", and 3 of my singles. </p>

<h3>Sans Masque the EP </h3>
<p>This project is dedicated to anyone on the search of truly finding themselves in a culture saturated with hypocritical principles.  One which boasts of individuality all while constantly streaming commercials that feed off insecurities in order to sell products. Sans Masque (Without Mask).  Take off your mask and embrace your strengths and discover your own weaknesses.  </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>Why will this EP be successful? </h3>
<p>I take pride in hard work.  I am surrounded by talented and amazing people who enjoy sharing their skills for a good cause and I strive to make the world a little better than it was before I got here.  If I've learned anything since I began recording music, it's that you can't force anything and if you do it will become evident in the final product.  Working with Jason on my latest project, Little One (releasing 7/27/15), was an amazing unforced experience in which we brought our strengths to the table all while complimenting each others weaknesses.  This method of creating is my new mantra and it will be clear when you hear.  </p>

</div><p></p></div>","Not just any EP...In 2009 I became a rapper. How do you become a rapper you ask? I really don't know the answer to that. You see in my case, I just borrowed the maiden name of my maternal grandmother and went around calling myself a rapper. Shortly after becoming a ""rapper"", I did what most people do… Just mimicked what I saw and heard. I wrote lyrics. Book loads of them. I'd get rap instrumentals from anyone I could and I would spend hours and hours just writing lyrics under the streets of NYC while commuting to and from work on the subway. Though, I genuinely enjoy all of the music I've ever made, something never felt quite right. I felt like I was putting on a bit of a character and trying to be like other rappers. During that time I was trying to find my sound and the only way I knew how to do it, was to mimic what I had heard other artists do.  6 years, 2 EP's & 4 singles later I have finally found MY sound. I've started making a kind of music that is truer to me and to be completely honest, it's not really rap. I don't know exactly what it is, but I love it and I really can't wait to share it with you. How much do we need?$5,000Your contribution will cover the costs associated with creating an extremely professional project in which you'll be able to say, ""I helped create that"".Your currency will pay for: Studio Time, Mixing, Mastering, Hiring local musicians (The magic), Album Art & Digital distribution  for 3 well packaged tracks that will impact humanity.  Where is your money going?A bulk of the budget will go into production costs. My friend, fellow musician and producer Jason Merritt will open his home studio to me for many hours while he records, edits, mixes and masters the tracks all while wearing the producer hat.  Why Jason Merritt? Jason has been able to capture the exact sound required for this EP.  Not only that, he's got credits.
Jason has worked extensively with 5 time Grammy nominated Tift Merritt (No relation). He Mixed Chatham County Line's record ""Wildwood"", Co produced recorded and mixed Six String Drag's record ""Roots Rock-n-roll"", Co produced, recorded and mixed Keny Roby's critically acclaimed record ""Memories and birds"", worked with Underhill Rose on 2 records and a lot of other things... He also recorded and mixed a track of Bloodshot Records 25th anniversary…To top it all off, he's been in sessions with Dr. Dre, Paul Westerberg and Courtney love.  Not only has he been successful behind the scenes pushing the record button, he has also shared the stage with Keny Roby while on a 2 week tour opening for Citizen Cope.

<p>Hi, I'm Julie Nolen. Most people call me Julie Effin Nolen, polite for...well, you know. </p>
<p>Born and raised in West Texas, I came to Austin at the turn of the century to write stories and make music. This full length record will be my first as a completely solo artist. Done my way. Little bit country and a lotta bit rock n roll.</p>

<h3>Palenke Soultribe at a turning point</h3>
<p><i>What started in Colombia with two artists in 2006 has grown into an amazing live &amp; electronic 4-piece band. They serve up infectious Afro-Colombian rhythms with spicy electronic dance tunes. Founders/producers <b>Juan Borda </b>and <b>Andres 'Popa' Erazo</b> teamed up with drummer <b>Argel Cota</b> &amp; percussionist <b>Clodomiro Montes</b> in their current home Los Angeles, completing that shimmering punchy-ness that is Palenke's signature sound.</i> </p>
<p>Perusing this musical path over the years has been challenging, but it's been beyond inspiring! We're so grateful to have been touring and sharing our music with so many diverse people. Three years ago we never would have imagined that we would play festivals like Glastonbury, and yet, there we were. <br/>We've done so much a small team, so it's time to take things to the next level!</p>

Palenke Soultribe at a turning point
What started in Colombia with two artists in 2006 has grown into an amazing live & electronic 4-piece band. They serve up infectious Afro-Colombian rhythms with spicy electronic dance tunes. Founders/producers Juan Borda and Andres 'Popa' Erazo teamed up with drummer Argel Cota & percussionist Clodomiro Montes in their current home Los Angeles, completing that shimmering punchy-ness that is Palenke's signature sound. 
Perusing this musical path over the years has been challenging, but it's been beyond inspiring! We're so grateful to have been touring and sharing our music with so many diverse people. Three years ago we never would have imagined that we would play festivals like Glastonbury, and yet, there we were. We've done so much a small team, so it's time to take things to the next level!



Our goals at WOMEX, BudapestWe're thrilled that PST has officially been invited to showcase at one of the world's largest music markets: WOMEX! On 22 October we'll have the opportunity to play in front of 2500 professionals: presenters, agents, labels and media from all over the globe, generating huge exposure. Our management company, Kokako Music, has been working tirelessly to get us to this point and has done most of the booking. Together we have to expand! It's the opportunity we've been looking for, the means to find the right partners to get our music out there TO YOU!  What's involved:
Finding labels to release our new album SANGRE
Finding agents for specific regions, to build viable tours
Playing live to get discovered by festival/venue promoters
Meeting with press to spread the word
and much more! 
All this will take place in Budapest, Hungary, 22 Oct 2015.


 
Making SANGRE

In order to accomplish the above, we need to present our new album. On stage we have such amazing chemistry and fun, that we've set out to capture that vibe on our forthcoming album SANGRE.
SANGRE completes the final chapter in our a 3-album series. It represents the third color - red -of the Colombian flag, complementing the previous 2: 'Oro' (yellow) and 'Mar' (blue)This album represents passion, love and exhilarating (heart) beats. it is us literally pouring our experiences and hearts out to you. So not only do we need to finish this for Womex, we need to finish this chapter for ourselves.SANGRE will include collaborations with some of our gifted musical friends.

</p><p align=""center""><b><u>COSTRUIAMO MUSICA</u></b></p><p><b><u>Chi siamo?</u></b></p>
<p>La banda
musicale <em>“Francesco Curcio”</em> di Amantea (CS) porta oggi il nome del suo
fondatore e primo maestro che, nel 1987, ha dato vita a questa grande realtà
con lo scopo di avvicinare al mondo musicale i giovani del territorio in una
regione difficile come la Calabria.</p>
<p>il maestro Curcio, è riuscito in poco tempo a
costruire un organico di giovanissimi dalle grandi potenzialità che col passare
dagli anni è cresciuto ed ha raggiunto traguardi insperati in giro per l’Italia
e nel mondo portando la sua musica. </p>
<p>Ancora più importante, è riuscito <b>a creare momenti di socializzazione,
coinvolgimento e formazione musicale </b>dando vita ad un gruppo di giovani,
meno giovani e giovanissimi che condividono la stessa passione e si impegnano
per portare avanti un progetto comune, in miglioramento costante.</p>
<p><b><u>Cosa facciamo
e cosa abbiamo fatto?</u></b></p>
<p>L’impegno giornaliero ci ha portati ad
ottenere grandi risultati in Italia così come all’estero.</p>
<p>Nel 2003 ci siamo esibiti al <em>6º
Festival Internacional de Mùsica Amadora dos Templàrios </em>a Tomar, in <b>Portogallo</b>. </p>
<p>Il 2004 ha suggellato un periodo di grandi
successi con il 1° posto nel concorso nazionale “Energia in Banda” a Napoli e il
titolo nazionale della <b>BANDA MUSICALE
PIÙ GIOVANE D’ITALIA</b>, premio riconosciuto per la migliore interpretazione
eseguita dalla banda musicale più giovane</p>
<p>Nel 2005, abbiamo partecipato alla
prestigiosa parata del <b><i>COLUMBUS DAY</i></b> per le vie principali
di <b>New York</b>. Infine, nel 2006, è tra
le partecipanti al concorso internazionale di <b>Barcellona</b> “Festival Internazionale delle Bande Musicali Europee”.</p>
<p>Tra i prestigiosi riconoscimenti bisogna
ricordare che, in occasione dei festeggiamenti per il 150° Anniversario
dell’Unità d’Italia, il Presidente del Comitato per le Celebrazioni dei 150
anni dell’Unità d’Italia ha conferito il titolo di “<b>BANDA MUSICALE DEL 150° ANNIVERSARIO DELL’UNITÀ D’ITALIA</b>”.</p>
<p>Questi riconoscimenti non vogliono essere dei
traguardi ma delle tappe nel nostro percorso di crescita sia come associazione
musicale che come punto di riferimento per l’intero hinterland di Amantea, e
soprattutto per i giovani e giovanissimi.</p>
<p><b><u>Cosa vogliamo
fare?</u></b></p>
<p>Anche il talento musicale ha bisogno di mezzi
adeguati. Finora tutte le attività son state realizzate in un piccolo magazzino
adattato a sala prove, dovendo inoltre pagare un cospicuo affitto, che in un
periodo particolare come quello odierno rischia di soffocare la nostra
associazione, che non riceve più praticamente nessun contributo.</p>
<p>Abbiamo perciò intenzione di <b>realizzare un plesso moderno</b> che permetta
di fornire un sostegno adeguato alla formazione dei ragazzi e alla
continuazione delle attività fin qui svolte.</p>
<p>A tal proposito l’amministrazione comunale, non
potendo finanziare un edificio ex novo, ha premiato l’associazione assegnando
un terreno di circa 1.500 mq per la realizzazione di un polo di attrazione
d’eccellenza a condizione che la struttura venga realizzata in tempi
prestabiliti dalla convenzione. </p>
<p>Un progetto che prevede una sede a forma di
una chiave di violino, divisa in 3 blocchi: una grande sala da concerto e altre
due sale per attività didattico – formative costruito in modo tale da
richiamare l’attenzione anche sulla <b>sostenibilità
ambientale</b>. Insomma, non solo musica, ma cultura in senso più lato. </p>
<p>Alla base del progetto i criteri tengono
conto dell’ambiente circostante in cui il plesso dovrà essere inserito, ovvero in
un’area già parzialmente urbanizzata che comprende un plesso scolastico e un
palazzetto dello sport.</p>
<p>Per la realizzazione dell’intero progetto il
costo stimato è di € 400.000. Una cifra considerevole ma estremamente
necessaria per il futuro di numerosi giovani talentuosi che vedono svanire i
propri sogni.</p>
<p>L’obiettivo minimo del direttivo è quello di
realizzare almeno il primo blocco così da permettere all’associazione di
svolgere in maniera autonoma le attività bandistiche basilari. </p>
<p><b><u>Perché sostenere il nostro progetto?</u></b></p>
<p>Sostenere il nostro progetto significa
sostenere i giovani calabresi, non solo i giovani della Banda Curcio <b><u>a credere ancora nella cultura</u></b>, <u>soprattutto
quella musicale</u>, oggi più che mai penalizzata. Confidiamo in chi, come noi,
crede nella musica come presupposto per un futuro migliore, dove le arti
musicali coincidano con uno sviluppo sostenibile, e dove soprattutto, si possa ancora
sperare di realizzare i propri scopi senza dover sacrificare le proprie
passioni. </p>
<p>È un grande sogno non irrealizzabile, ma <b>serve il contributo di tutti.</b> </p>
<p>Per questo motivo abbiamo realizzato questo
video, con la speranza che il messaggio arrivi a tutti voi.</p>
<p>Ogni contributo sarà ben accetto e, per
maggiori informazioni, visita il sito <a href=""http://www.bandafrancescocurcio.it/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>www.bandafrancescocurcio.it</u></a> nella sezione

<p>The
“Francesco Curcio” Musical Ensemble in Amantea, Italy has the name of his
founder and first director who, in 1987, gave life to this great reality, in
order to attract young people to music in a difficult territory, Calabria.</p>
<p>Director Curcio,
in a short time has created a big ensemble made up of talented people that has
grown during the years and has achieved important not expected goals all over
Italy and the World, thanks to its music.</p>
<p>Even much
more important, he created socialization, participation and musical formation
moments, for young, younger and less young people who share the same passion
and work hard to carry on a common project, always improving.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What are we doing? And what have we done?</b></p>
<p>We worked
hard every day to reach great results both in Italy and all over the World.</p>
<p>In 2003
we participated in the “<em><span>6º Festival Internacional de Mùsica Amadora dos Templàrios”, in Tomar,
Portugal.</span></em></p>
<p><em>In 2004 we achieved a lot of
prizes starting with the 1<sup>st</sup> prize at the </em>National Competition “Energia in
Banda” in Naples, which allowed us to win the “Italian Youngest Ensemble”
prize, in Florence, for the best performance by the youngest ensemble.</p>
<p>In 2005,
we took part in the Columbus Day parade in New York and finally, in 2006, we
came back to Europe to participate in the “European Musical Ensemble
International Festival”, in Barcelona.</p>
<p>Among our
achievements, we can’t forget that in 2011, the President of the Committee for
the 150th Anniversary of the Italian Unification declared us “Ensemble of the
150th Anniversary of the Italian Unification”</p>
<p>All these
achievements are not objectives but we look at them as necessary steps to grow
both as musical ensemble and as benchmark for the whole community.</p>
<p><b>What would we like to do?</b></p>
<p>Even
musical talent needs to be supported. Until now, all our activities have been
performed in a small storehouse that we used as practice room, paying a
substantial rent that we can’t afford to pay anymore and that could lead to
bankruptcy, since our Ensemble has not a public fund.</p>
<p>So, we
would like to build a modern building to continue performing our educational
and musical activities.</p>
<p>Since the
local administration can’t finance a new building for our activities, it gave
us a plot of land (1500 square meters) for the building of a new rehearsal
room, to help us achieving our goal, but on the condition that it will be built
within the established time frame.</p>
<p>Our
project is a treble clef building made up of three blocks: a big concert room
and two smaller rooms for educational activities, which will be built looking
at the environmental sustainability. So, not only music, but culture!</p>
<p>Criteria
used in this project took account of the environment where the rehearsal room
will be built, that is a partially urbanized area, near to a school complex and
a sports arena.</p>
<p>To
achieve our project, the estimate cost is of €400.000. It is a large sum but
absolutely needed to continue helping our talented musicians have a future.</p>
<p>The

<br/></div>","COSTRUIAMO MUSICAChi siamo?
La banda
musicale “Francesco Curcio” di Amantea (CS) porta oggi il nome del suo
fondatore e primo maestro che, nel 1987, ha dato vita a questa grande realtà
con lo scopo di avvicinare al mondo musicale i giovani del territorio in una
regione difficile come la Calabria.
il maestro Curcio, è riuscito in poco tempo a
costruire un organico di giovanissimi dalle grandi potenzialità che col passare
dagli anni è cresciuto ed ha raggiunto traguardi insperati in giro per l’Italia
e nel mondo portando la sua musica. 
Ancora più importante, è riuscito a creare momenti di socializzazione,
coinvolgimento e formazione musicale dando vita ad un gruppo di giovani,
meno giovani e giovanissimi che condividono la stessa passione e si impegnano
per portare avanti un progetto comune, in miglioramento costante.
Cosa facciamo
e cosa abbiamo fatto?
L’impegno giornaliero ci ha portati ad
ottenere grandi risultati in Italia così come all’estero.
Nel 2003 ci siamo esibiti al 6º
Festival Internacional de Mùsica Amadora dos Templàrios a Tomar, in Portogallo. 
Il 2004 ha suggellato un periodo di grandi
successi con il 1° posto nel concorso nazionale “Energia in Banda” a Napoli e il
titolo nazionale della BANDA MUSICALE
PIÙ GIOVANE D’ITALIA, premio riconosciuto per la migliore interpretazione
eseguita dalla banda musicale più giovane
Nel 2005, abbiamo partecipato alla
prestigiosa parata del COLUMBUS DAY per le vie principali
di New York. Infine, nel 2006, è tra
le partecipanti al concorso internazionale di Barcellona “Festival Internazionale delle Bande Musicali Europee”.
Tra i prestigiosi riconoscimenti bisogna
ricordare che, in occasione dei festeggiamenti per il 150° Anniversario
dell’Unità d’Italia, il Presidente del Comitato per le Celebrazioni dei 150
anni dell’Unità d’Italia ha conferito il titolo di “BANDA MUSICALE DEL 150° ANNIVERSARIO DELL’UNITÀ D’ITALIA”.
Questi riconoscimenti non vogliono essere dei
traguardi ma delle tappe nel nostro percorso di crescita sia come associazione
musicale che come punto di riferimento per l’intero hinterland di Amantea, e
soprattutto per i giovani e giovanissimi.
Cosa vogliamo
fare?
Anche il talento musicale ha bisogno di mezzi
adeguati. Finora tutte le attività son state realizzate in un piccolo magazzino
adattato a sala prove, dovendo inoltre pagare un cospicuo affitto, che in un
periodo particolare come quello odierno rischia di soffocare la nostra
associazione, che non riceve più praticamente nessun contributo.
Abbiamo perciò intenzione di realizzare un plesso moderno che permetta
di fornire un sostegno adeguato alla formazione dei ragazzi e alla
continuazione delle attività fin qui svolte.
A tal proposito l’amministrazione comunale, non
potendo finanziare un edificio ex novo, ha premiato l’associazione assegnando
un terreno di circa 1.500 mq per la realizzazione di un polo di attrazione
d’eccellenza a condizione che la struttura venga realizzata in tempi
prestabiliti dalla convenzione. 
Un progetto che prevede una sede a forma di
una chiave di violino, divisa in 3 blocchi: una grande sala da concerto e altre
due sale per attività didattico – formative costruito in modo tale da
richiamare l’attenzione anche sulla sostenibilità
ambientale. Insomma, non solo musica, ma cultura in senso più lato. 
Alla base del progetto i criteri tengono
conto dell’ambiente circostante in cui il plesso dovrà essere inserito, ovvero in
un’area già parzialmente urbanizzata che comprende un plesso scolastico e un
palazzetto dello sport.
Per la realizzazione dell’intero progetto il
costo stimato è di € 400.000. Una cifra considerevole ma estremamente
necessaria per il futuro di numerosi giovani talentuosi che vedono svanire i
propri sogni.
L’obiettivo minimo del direttivo è quello di
realizzare almeno il primo blocco così da permettere all’associazione di
svolgere in maniera autonoma le attività bandistiche basilari. 
Perché sostenere il nostro progetto?
Sostenere il nostro progetto significa
sostenere i giovani calabresi, non solo i giovani della Banda Curcio a credere ancora nella cultura, soprattutto
quella musicale, oggi più che mai penalizzata. Confidiamo in chi, come noi,
crede nella musica come presupposto per un futuro migliore, dove le arti
musicali coincidano con uno sviluppo sostenibile, e dove soprattutto, si possa ancora
sperare di realizzare i propri scopi senza dover sacrificare le proprie
passioni. 
È un grande sogno non irrealizzabile, ma serve il contributo di tutti. 
Per questo motivo abbiamo realizzato questo
video, con la speranza che il messaggio arrivi a tutti voi.
Ogni contributo sarà ben accetto e, per
maggiori informazioni, visita il sito www.bandafrancescocurcio.it nella sezione
“nuova sede Banda Curcio”.
BUILDING MUSICWho are we?
The
“Francesco Curcio” Musical Ensemble in Amantea, Italy has the name of his
founder and first director who, in 1987, gave life to this great reality, in
order to attract young people to music in a difficult territory, Calabria.
Director Curcio,
in a short time has created a big ensemble made up of talented people that has
grown during the years and has achieved important not expected goals all over
Italy and the World, thanks to its music.
Even much
more important, he created socialization, participation and musical formation
moments, for young, younger and less young people who share the same passion
and work hard to carry on a common project, always improving.

What are we doing? And what have we done?
We worked
hard every day to reach great results both in Italy and all over the World.
In 2003
we participated in the “6º Festival Internacional de Mùsica Amadora dos Templàrios”, in Tomar,
Portugal.
In 2004 we achieved a lot of
prizes starting with the 1st prize at the National Competition “Energia in
Banda” in Naples, which allowed us to win the “Italian Youngest Ensemble”
prize, in Florence, for the best performance by the youngest ensemble.
In 2005,
we took part in the Columbus Day parade in New York and finally, in 2006, we
came back to Europe to participate in the “European Musical Ensemble
International Festival”, in Barcelona.
Among our
achievements, we can’t forget that in 2011, the President of the Committee for
the 150th Anniversary of the Italian Unification declared us “Ensemble of the
150th Anniversary of the Italian Unification”
All these
achievements are not objectives but we look at them as necessary steps to grow
both as musical ensemble and as benchmark for the whole community.
What would we like to do?
Even
musical talent needs to be supported. Until now, all our activities have been
performed in a small storehouse that we used as practice room, paying a
substantial rent that we can’t afford to pay anymore and that could lead to
bankruptcy, since our Ensemble has not a public fund.
So, we
would like to build a modern building to continue performing our educational
and musical activities.
Since the
local administration can’t finance a new building for our activities, it gave
us a plot of land (1500 square meters) for the building of a new rehearsal
room, to help us achieving our goal, but on the condition that it will be built
within the established time frame.
Our
project is a treble clef building made up of three blocks: a big concert room
and two smaller rooms for educational activities, which will be built looking
at the environmental sustainability. So, not only music, but culture!
Criteria
used in this project took account of the environment where the rehearsal room
will be built, that is a partially urbanized area, near to a school complex and
a sports arena.
To
achieve our project, the estimate cost is of €400.000. It is a large sum but
absolutely needed to continue helping our talented musicians have a future.
The
minimum target is to build the first block (the concert room), at least, to
allow the Ensemble continue performing its basic activities in complete
autonomy.

Why should you support
our dream?

Supporting our project means helping Calabrian people and not only the
members of the “Francesco Curcio” Musical Ensemble to continue believing in
culture and, mainly, in musical culture, nowadays penalized.
We trust in those who believe in music as a tool for a better future,
where musical arts can grow with a sustainable development and where it is
still possible to realize our dreams without sacrificing our passions.
It is a big dream but it is not impossible, and we need all your help!
For this reason, we made a video, hoping that our message will reach you
all.

<p>In 1995, the band entered the studios to

<p>The demo tape got extremely good response
from the world wide underground metal scene, and was completely sold out at 450

<p>In 2004, after seven years of silence,
""The Bishop of Hexen"" rejoined once again and recorded a promo CD,entitled ""Unveil the Curtain

<p>in its highest degree. The promo CD was
highly appraised by record labels &amp; magazines around the metal scene.</p>

""The Nightmarish Compositions"" album, entitled: ""The Somber Grounds

featured in the highly praised ""Brutal Legend"" video game soundtrack

already performed on various stages around Europe and recently also in <b>Jamaica. </b>She has done shows at festivals like Reggae Sun Ska (FR) and Future Reggae Ruigoord (NL) and has opened for artists like Israel Vibration, Ziggy Marley, Etana and Groundation. On her very inspirational<a href=""http://leahrosier.com/post/115586647583/leahinjamaica"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""> journey to Jamaica</a> she got invited by King Yellowman to sing at one of his concerts. Ever since Leah developed
skills to record her own songs, she has been voicing many different riddims by
producers and bands from all over the world. She released <b>her first
album High Paw in 2012</b> on her own label Likkle Green. In Amsterdam, Leah works closely with <a href=""http://www.blackstarfoundation.nl/index.php?lang=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.blackstarfoundation.nl/index.php?lang=en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Black Star Foundation</a>, a non-profit organization which has been committed to promote Reggae music in Holland for more than ten years. </p>

We've opened for French acts like Danakil and Mo'Kalamity. Last year we made a video for Leah's song <b>Enough Is Enough</b> on Rise &amp; Shine's Pitaya Riddim.

""Irie""
[ai-ri \i'-ree] is Jamaican word and it means 'alright, good'. Positive. And
that's all we want to do! Share good vibes, only irie vibes!Who are we?
Leah Rosier from Amsterdam, the Netherlands, is passionate about
Reggae and combines this with her love for singing and writing songs. With a
joyful international mindset determined to share those irie vibes anywhere, Leah has
already performed on various stages around Europe and recently also in Jamaica. She has done shows at festivals like Reggae Sun Ska (FR) and Future Reggae Ruigoord (NL) and has opened for artists like Israel Vibration, Ziggy Marley, Etana and Groundation. On her very inspirational journey to Jamaica she got invited by King Yellowman to sing at one of his concerts. Ever since Leah developed
skills to record her own songs, she has been voicing many different riddims by
producers and bands from all over the world. She released her first
album High Paw in 2012 on her own label Likkle Green. In Amsterdam, Leah works closely with Black Star Foundation, a non-profit organization which has been committed to promote Reggae music in Holland for more than ten years. 
Rise & Shine is a Reggae backing band from
Besançon, France, consisting of six experienced musicians and a producer. They are members of Uppertone, a local organization which has been supporting and promoting Jamaican music in all its forms for over a decade. In
the past Rise & Shine have done live shows with French artists like Yaniss Odua and
Nuttea. Besides backing reggae and dancehall singers, Rise & Shine also
produce their own riddims. For their two projects Opus Riddim (2011) and Pitaya
Riddim (2014) they have worked with various artists like Jah Mason, Queen Omega
and Ricardo Clarke.
How we linked upTogether we have been making Reggae
music since 2011 when we connected through social media and the band sent Leah
some music to voice. This resulted in the song Music Teach Me (Opus Riddim) and
Love Fyah, featured on Leah’s first album. In March 2012 we all met each other
when Leah came to Besançon for three weeks to rehearse for our first shows that
same month. 
Ever since we started performing live we've had a great connection, we all get along very well. We bring out a lot of creativity in each other. We've done many gigs in France and Switzerland in bars, clubs and other venues and also at festivals like Swimming Poule, Cult’Urban and Festival de la Paille. We've opened for French acts like Danakil and Mo'Kalamity. Last year we made a video for Leah's song Enough Is Enough on Rise & Shine's Pitaya Riddim. All this productivity and our strong bond naturally led into making an album together.
Our album: Only Irie VibesThe past
year we've put our heart and soul in writing this album and right now the final
recordings are happening at studio Le Zèbre in Besançon, France. It brings joy to say that our album
includes two collaborations with Jamaican artists recorded in Kingston, where
Leah Rosier went earlier this year. One with the legendary vocal group The
Mighty Diamonds and another with rising star Jahbar I. On this very productive
and inspirational trip to Jamaica, Leah recorded two more duets, performed six
times and shot a lot of video material.Leah Rosier recorded a duet for our album at Anchor Studios in Kingston, Jamaica.

<p>“We are Arise Band, living in the sunny city of Durban in the vibrant country of South Africa. Arise is a band that could be described as many things but we see ourselves as a group of young, passionate Christians who write music about what is close to our hearts. With many musical influences at work in our personal lives, we find a fresh and vibrant sound emerging as we play together”</p>
<p>We are currently working on our first full-length album following our debut EP “Jesus Is” which was released in July 2013. The band is working with esteemed Producer Nik Fairclough who produced the award winning “Life and Times of Absolute Truth” album by band Tree63. Nik has also worked with artists such as Chris Tomlin, Matt Redman as well as one of our own friends, Tim Hughes.</p>
<p>An album for any band is a timestamp of their journey and aims to capture some of the life and passion of the music that they create. For our upcoming album we are excited to not only lay down the songs that we have been writing but to more importantly release anthems that will strengthen the church and inspire those who might be on a journey to finding Jesus. We are trusting for the words and music in this album to reach far beyond our feet and to lift up a sound that we could not match, as voices from around the world make these lyrics their own personal war cries.</p>
<p><b>WHAT WE NEED</b></p>
<p>Albums cost money, as we are sure that people know. Just how much money is up to the band itself in a lot of regards. One could record in their bedroom and make it huge like Owl City, or you could go to Abbey Road and come out sounding like the Beatles. We are aiming to capture these songs in the best way that we possibly can and that will be costing us a chunk of money. We are asking for your help to cover our costs of producing a quality product and distributing it around the country. Here is a list of what the funds we raise will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Studio time</li>
<li>Mixing and mastering</li>
<li>Replication and printing of albums</li>
<li>Marketing </li>
<li>Distribution</li>
<li>Merch for the album</li>
</ul>
<div>We are not sitting back expecting for the money to fall out of the sky and so the amount we are aiming to raise on indiegogo is a portion of the album cost. We have been saving, working and raising the rest on our own so basically we are asking you to <b>join</b> us in funding the album and not simply asking you to fund it alone.</div>

<p><b>OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELP</b></p>

<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>WHAT IS SAGIP?</h3>
<p>SAGIP, in English, means RESCUE or SAVE. This is exactly what the movement aims to accomplish. To rescue and save the Filipino nation from total destruction due to corruption. Living in the Philippines, it is not hard to notice the never-ending vicious cycle of corruption which exists in all levels of society. Civilians, businessmen, government officials, big, small, rich, poor, etc. No one is exempted. Every Filipino desires progress for his/her nation for sure. Who wouldn't? But when it comes to action, nobody seems to be interested in 'walking the talk'. People (regardless of their social class) would almost always pursue their own self-interest in matters concerning society. The effects to the Philippine society are not good. They're terrible. </p>
<p>This is the reason why SAGIP is born. To combat the disease spreading in the Philippines. SAGIP believes that with true unity, the Filipino people can save and rescue the nation.</p>
<h3>HOW?</h3>
<p>SAGIP makes use of one particular medium to accomplish what it wants to accomplish: MUSIC. </p>
<p>WHY MUSIC?</p>
<p> Music is a powerful medium, even a catalyst to unite people together specially those sharing the same sentiments or vision. Filipinos all ever the world love music. Whether they live in the city or rural areas, music is part of their lives. From children to adults ,Filipinos are known to love singing and some made it big time globally. Thus we see music as a means to activate every Filipino as a mover for change which gave birth to this project. Given the right message of a song, they will likely catch the vision to be a change mover for the nation.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">SAGIP wishes to use music in order to do the following:</span></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<ul>
<li>To stir up Filipinos and show them the full reality of the state of their nation. </li>
<li>To show them (whether they be politicians, normal citizens, etc.) the things they are doing wrong which, in turn, hinders true progress. <span style=""background-color: initial;""> </span>
</li>
<li><span style=""background-color: initial;"">To encourage all Filipinos to help their country break away from the vicious cycle of corruption that has been plaguing the Philippines since who-knows-when.</span></li>
</ul>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>MUSIC CREATED...SO FAR</h3>
<div>SAGIP has been able to release 4 songs so far. Thanks to contributing artist: Maralita. The songs were independently released since  there seems to be no local record label interested in distributing songs like these. The four songs can be heard through SAGIP's YouTube channel. To hear the songs. please go to the link below -</div>

</div>
<h3>THE PLAN</h3>
<div>So what does SAGIP want to do now? </div>
<div>Release a hit song and make an EP album that will include this new song plus all the other past songs released under SAGIP. The plans for the new song are as follows:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>To produce the possible hit song using a powerful and hard-hitting genre: Rock-Rap. This genre is popular especially among the Filipino youth: the nation's future leaders.</li>
<li>To give it a message that will wake -up Filipinos and make them see the disease called corruption afflicting their country as the worst epidemic.  </li>
<li>To deal with all levels of corruption in the country  (government, lower-government, corporate and citizen).</li>
<li>To release the song prior to the 2016 elections (hopefully the song inspires them to be better decision makers when the election comes).</li>
<li>To collaborate with 3 of the most influential rap artists in the Philippines. The plan is to make them deliver the rap parts of the song. </li>
<li>To make a music video of the song. A visual support to the message of the song. </li>
<li>To market the song full-blast so that all may hear of the message contained in it. What use is the message if it will not be heard?</li>
</ul>
</div> </div> <div> <h3></h3>

<h3>WHY SAGIP NEEDS YOU HELP</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Making music purely out of love for country &amp; not for the financial satisfaction of local record labels is a hard task. It remains to be an unattractive venture for local record labels whose main goal is profits (just like all the other businesses). This forces SAGIP to operate independently. The movement is able to create and release songs due to the personal and heartfelt contributions of artists and all the other people in it. </p>
<p>For SAGIP to survive and be able to create more music for the country, it needs the help of more people who share the same stand and sentiment as SAGIP's. SAGIP invites you to be a part of the movement. Support SAGIP and help the movement stir up more Filipinos through music.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>WHERE YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS WILL GO</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b>Music - </b>recording, mixing, arrangement, featured artists' talent fees, &amp; musicians' talent fees. We want the music itself to be a masterpiece carefully crafted to perfection. It must tackle all the issues aimed to be dealt with and it must be arranged in such a way that it will leave a mark to the listener. A good mark. </p>
<p><b>Music Video -</b> production (filming, props, talent fees, equipment rental, wardrobe, set design, etc.) &amp; post-production costs (Editing, visual FX, color correction, etc.). Similar to the music, it is our desire that the music video be produced with flying colors. Something that will not escape the attention of the viewer. The best will be done in order to visually communicate the message of the song efficiently and effectively. The music video will consume most of the budget that will be gathered for this project. </p>
<p><b>Marketing - </b>We want to make sure that the song and its music video reach as many Filipinos as possible. Hence, the team behind SAGIP will be making use of radio (which is still quite a powerful entity in the music industry of the Philippines) and YouTube in spreading the song. Radio tours, social media promotions and YouTube promotion tactics will be employed. </p>
<p><b>EP Album</b> - Mastering, Album Art &amp; CD replication. The new song will be compiled with SAGIP's existing songs and the factors mentioned are the ones that will incur costs.</p>

<p>Ek hoop julle het my klein filmpie hierbo geniet.</p>
<p>Luister, ons sukkel hier in Slangfontein. Dit het laas jaar glad nie gereën nie en die vee kla aanhoudend, maar dis nie hoekom ons mismoedig is nie.</p>
<p>Ons is mismoedig omdat die Radio Kalahari Orkes al vir jare elke Saterdagaand hier op die stoep sit en werk aan nuwe liedjies wat ons graag wil hê julle moet hoor. Van hulle is vastrap, ander is trane-trekkers, meeste van hulle is nogal kwaai.  Ons kan egter nie die deuntjies uitgee nie, want die die platebedryf, soos ons dit ken, het verdwyn soos 'n reenwolk in die hemel bo ons dorre ou plaasie.</p>
<p>Onlangs het ons Upington toe gery en wat vind ons daar? Die gebou wat eens ons platemaatskappy gehuisves het staan leeg. Al wat oorgebly het is stof en stukkende vensters en ’n dronkie wie seg gaan huistoe! Die musiek bedryf het sy gat gesien! Het julle takhare nog nie van <i>free downloads</i> gehoor nie?</p>
<p>Met ‘n stukkende boerehart en knop in die keel klim ons in ons ou bakkie en ry huistoe. Op die stoep vat ons ’n sluk mampoer. Ek vra: “Boys, kan julle dit glo?” en die ouens sug. In die verte staan 'n maer tollie stert innie lug, kou stof en klippies met ‘n bevoeterde gesig.</p>
<p>Eweskielik veskyn ou Kleinboet, skoolbaadjie en al, mooi gejelde hare en ’n broek wat te knap is om af te val. Hy staan en idle, opgewonde, soos ’n ou Ford kar. Hy wil weet waarom almal so mismoedig lyk. Ons verduidelik en Kleinboet lag. “Nee wat Oom Boet,” seg hy. “<i>No need to be sad.</i> Ek ken ’n nuwe nommer, iets nogal baie <i>rad</i>. Ons laaities noem dit “<i>crowd funding</i>”.</p>
<p>Soos ek die storie verstaan werk hierdie “crowd funding” so. Ons sê vir ons fans: “Broers en susters, ons het julle verskriklik lief. Julle het by ons gestaan en ons CD's gekoop en as die kar se petrol klaar was, het julle tot by ons shows geloop<i>. </i>Dis vir julle wat ons hierdie nuwe liedjies geskryf het, maar die platemaatskappy is in sy moer en ons het skaars ’n geldjie om die maer tollies te voer. Hoe maak ons nou?”</p>
<p>Hier’s die plan: Julle gee vir ons ’n ietsie, en ons gebruik dit om julle hêppie te maak. Boonop kry jy lekker presente - goed wat jy en slegs JY in die hande kan kry. Niemand anders nie. Nooit ooit.</p>
<p>Hier op die regterhand van die bladsy is van die sweeties uiteengesit, maar daar's nog baie meer.</p><p></p><p>Maar dit is nie net ’n nuwe CD wat ons belplan nie, ons wil veel meer aanpak.</p><p>RKO wil met ’n “drie-fase” aanslag vorendag kom. ’n Driepoot pot so te sê.

(Dit is noemenswaardig dat in Amerika die bemarkingsbegroting gewoonlik veel hoër is as die prduksiekoste: Sowat 60-40)</p><p> Dit bring ons by die tweede fase; naamlik die produksie van drie films. ’n Dokumentêre film van die hele proses, en twee musiek videos. Nie net movies nie - spesiale flieks wat mense sal laat KYK en geniet.</p><p>Laastens die derde fase of te wel die Koeksuster op die koek.: Die opstal op R.K.O se plaas was nog altyd die musiek, daarom het ons al klaar vir een van Afrikaans se grootste dramaturgte, Harry Kalmer, gevra om vir ons ’n splinternuwe verhoogstuk te skryf.

</div></div>","They say it takes a lifetime to put out your first album and as I prepare to release this project to the world, this statement couldn't feel more true. A journey from New York City to Berlin to Cologne to Stockholm has led me to this point, asking for your support, in order to give a voice and a platform to a new and refreshing sound available to be experienced by people everywhere.  


I've spent the last two years conceptualizing this piece, inspired by the vibrant nightlife of Berlin and New York, and the storytelling power that exists inside of house and techno music. And now I am in the process of developing a team, which is passionate about the music and the vision,  allowing  for the successful release of this project....


UP THE DOWNSTAIRCASE 

Up The Downstaircase is a collection of 12 tracks carefully crafted and written by myself, produced alongside a brilliant roster of International DJ/Producers from Berlin, Cologne, Leipzig, and Toronto. Beatkind, Bellville, Fennec and Wolf, K-Sonik, Liftboi, Vincent Stefansson, Sebastian Dittrich, and  Martin Tugendhat have worked with me to create this world that takes place in three parts.

1) The Night
2) The Nightlife
3) Sunrise
Visual inspiration from the project is now on my evolving Pinterest:

<p>So. I’m going to record a four song EP The Orchard… and my first music video. I’ve been obsessing over this project for months so let me start from the beginning</p>
<p>It is very rare that I write songs and care about them for more than a month or so. Usually, I move on pretty quickly and leave my past creations to wilt. One of the songs I wrote is called “Foolish Heart” and it didn’t get added to my collection of dusty old songs. In fact, I’m as excited about it today as I was the day I wrote it. Now, I know that I m building it up quite a bit. But, I truly think it’s something you will love. It’s a lot like what I’ve written in the past in that it has a district melody, is sufficiently original, and is catchy but it’s also like nothing I’ve ever written before. The lyrics are less strange and cryptic and you might even place it in the genre of “Pop”. BUT don’t let that scare you. You know me, I hate writing something that sounds like anything else. </p>
<p>The song Foolish Heart is about loving someone and not being sure if they love you back. You have this thought or feeling stuck inside your brain: Maybe, even if it’s just a .5% chance, maybe they love you back. And, it’s a rather exciting feeling, but you also feel quite pathetic and desperate at the same time. It’s an odd mental and emotional predicament and I think it’s something most of us can understand. </p>
<p>This person is all you think about and all you really want and in your brain you know it’s simply ridiculous to obsess over something that may never happen. BUT it’s the heart that drives us to madness. See, our mind knows better, but the heart…</p>
<p>The heart is foolish. </p>
<p>I had an uncommonly clear mental picture/story when I wrote this song…which is odd because usually when I write it’s about a couple different things. It has it’s own little world. That’s where the idea of a music video was born.  </p>
<p>After I wrote Foolish Heart I began to write more music than I ever had. The other songs on The Orchard are both reminiscent of past releases but also new and unexplored. The Orchard EP will include, collaborations, happy songs, sad songs, an incredible producer (he produced Hide and Seek), general artsy-ness, new themes, enhanced lyrics and melodies, cool artwork, and so much more. I literally cannot wait to show you. </p>
<p>THIS is when we decided to do the Indie-Go-Go</p>
<p></p><p>The statistics are: </p>
<p>$20,000+ for both a 4-song EP AND a music video <b>BY APRIL 10th 2015</b></p>
<p>This would cover:</p>
<p>-travel</p>
<p>-production of the 4 songs</p>
<p>-musicians</p>
<p>-production of the video</p>
<p>-directing of the video</p>
<p>-script</p>
<p>-costumes</p>
<p>-advertising</p>
<p>-extras</p>
<p>-location</p>
<p>-marketing</p>
<p> etc etc etc! </p>
<p>And more cool news is if we raise even more than $20,000…we will create even more content! Maybe a 6 song EP! Or another music video! The options are endless =] </p>
<p>This project is me. I’ve had a whole year to think it thorough, come up with ideas, and create. I’m ready, now. It’s time to start doing. </p>
<p>Let’s think of a good analogy to end this novel….My past music has been the humble embers of a quiet fire and this new EP and video will coax the flames up, lighting the way to new opportunities for perhaps a full length album, tours, and more! This project is the first stepping stone…and I <b>need your help</b>. You have supported me, stood by me, encouraged me, and made me who I am today (as cliche as that sentence is). Thank you so SO much. I feel honored to be followed by such wonderful people. I hope this project makes you excited and ready for an incredible future together. </p>

</p><p><b>The
Debut Studio Album Project Part 2</b></p>
<p>Music has always been a huge part of
my life. I come from a musical family, where all of my siblings played an
instrument, and sang, including my gospel singing parents. It was at an early
age when I got my voice singing in the family band. I knew singing was my gift.
I eventually went on to perform in music</p>
<p>festivals, gospel choirs, bands,
etc. in my young adult years. Life was good and I so enjoyed singing wherever,
anyone would have me. My career took off fast, however, I made the decision to
get married and start my family. My priority was to be a great mom and I did
not see a way that would allow me to</p>
<p>meet the needs of my children, and
focus on the demands of a career in the music industry at the same time. I have
three amazing children that are now my backup singers; well, at least two of
them. My youngest son is not quite there yet as a singer, but he is on track to
be my keyboardist in the future. Yes, I have amazing children. </p>
<p>So, I returned to the music scene
and began performing once again. I had the honor to perform before over 25,000
fans at the Tony Gwynn Memorial Tribute, open up for red hot jazz guitarist
Nick Colionne and join in the recording studio with jazz great Eloise Laws just
to name a few milestones. I also, had the pleasure of singing for former first
lady, Laura Bush, and the wedding of Gold Medalist, soccer great, Alex Morgan.
I have shared the stage with many national recording artists. I gained a great
fan base and sold out shows. I’m often asked after shows if I have music to
purchase and I’ve had to say no. Now, I am taking the next steps so I will
never have to say no again.</p>

<p>I have some of the greatest
songwriters and musicians joining me on this project. My producer is Grammy
Winner Kamau Kenyatta, who received a 2014 Grammy for producing best jazz
vocals album “Liquid Spirit” by jazz artist Gregory Porter. I am so excited to
work with Kamau and others to deliver my first album “I Still Love You”. The
title song was written by my dear friend and Grammy winner, Jaymes Felix.
Jaymes is a composer, musician, songwriter, and former lead singer of Tower of
Power. He also sang with Gospels legend, Andrae Crouch. Finally, Pamela Sawyer,
Motown songwriter whose music credits include, ""Love
Child"", ""If I Were Your Woman” has written a few songs for the album.</p>

<p><b>While I've been able to cover<span>  a good portion of the costs of recording
""I Still Love You"" on my own, when you are recording at this quality,
costs up add rapidly! Your donation to Daneen Wilburn’s Debut Studio Album Part

<ol>
<li>Pre-production: This
     is an important step standard in any commercial recording project. Kamau
     and I will start by discussing arrangements, examine lyrics and structure,
     and establish a plan for how additional instrumentation will be utilized.</li>
<li>Musicians
     &amp; Recording: Next, Kamau and I will hire some of the best
     musicians to play various instruments bringing to life the heart of this
     album. </li>
<li>Mixing
     &amp; Mastering: Each track will be mixed to add excitement and
     nuance to the compositions. The final step for the album will be mastered

Motown songwriter whose music credits include, ""Love
Child"", ""If I Were Your Woman” has written a few songs for the album.

While I've been able to cover  a good portion of the costs of recording
""I Still Love You"" on my own, when you are recording at this quality,
costs up add rapidly! Your donation to Daneen Wilburn’s Debut Studio Album Part
2 will go towards the following costs:

Pre-production: This
     is an important step standard in any commercial recording project. Kamau
     and I will start by discussing arrangements, examine lyrics and structure,
     and establish a plan for how additional instrumentation will be utilized.
Musicians
     & Recording: Next, Kamau and I will hire some of the best
     musicians to play various instruments bringing to life the heart of this
     album. 
Mixing
     & Mastering: Each track will be mixed to add excitement and
     nuance to the compositions. The final step for the album will be mastered
     from beginning to end, to ensure your listening ears have a great
     experience.
CD
     pressing and promotion

Please also don't hesitate to share this
campaign and check out some great perks too! There are social media share
buttons here on this page--and please tell your friends how grateful we are for
this support. “I Still Love You”.

<p>Avon Faire has just finished their debut album,“Riddles and Love Songs”, an 11-song collection of beautiful, traditional UK and Irish folk songs, sung in rich, 3-part harmony. And it's available now! </p>
<p>We are so excited about our new record; and we've created this page to sell CDs and T-Shirts and all kinds of special offers and incentives for you to enjoy - Thank you for your support!</p>
<p><strong>The Story of Avon Faire:</strong></p>
<p>Avon Faire is a female trio, inspired to sing in 3-part harmony &amp; play traditional UK &amp; Irish folk, Renaissance &amp; Medieval, and folk/pop songs.  </p>
<p>In New York City, Andriette Redmann asked friends Betsy Long and Kath Green to join her in a journey of singing beloved songs. In the first minute of hearing how we sounded together, Avon Faire was born.

<p>In the summer of 2015, Avon Faire embarked on a mini-tour of England: the historic Walter de Cantelupe Inn near Worcester; Bristol’s Arnolfini Gallery for an opening of internationally renowned artist (and Betsy's dad!) Richard Long; The Loxwood Joust in Sussex, a 2 weekend medieval festival where Avon Faire performed 4 sets per day, opening for the lauded Mediaeval Baebes; and in Cornwall for a sold-out show at the lovely Tremenheere Sculpture Gardens. The tour was a success, with enthusiastic audiences, new friends of all ages, and the enjoyment of the magical countryside, scenes reminiscent of lyrics in the songs.<br/><br/>Upon our return to NYC, we continued performing, including at Richard Long’s opening at the Sperone Westwater Gallery.

<p><b>The Nutshell. <br/></b><span>My name is Locks, I’m a songwriter based in North London. <br/>
This is the first indigogo campaign I’ve done.</span></p>
<p>I’m setting up this campaign to try and raise money to go back into the
studio with a new band to record a new EP: <em><em>Rattle Them Bones</em></em>. I’m really excited about this one
as we have already had such positive feedback from <i>Skeletons </i>which was aired on Steve Lamaqcs BBC6 Music show &amp;
will be featured on the EP. We already have PR interest as well, something I’ve
never had before. We have already booked three gigs for the spring/summer and
one festival (Sampire festival) which is in its’ first year! Funded entirely by
crowd funder and deemed one of the most successful crowd funded campaigns. I am
usually constantly booking gigs however now’s the time to focus on rehearsing
and recording. </p>
<p>The style of music borders on Nick Cave &amp; The Bad Seeds <i>Murder Ballads, </i>Tom Waits, a bit of Dead
Mans Bones and possibly Kill it Kid. It’s dark &amp; jaunty, the lyrics focus
on the unnerving parts of life we all encounter, the bits that people try to
ignore in themselves or that consume them. </p>
<p><i>Rattle Them Bones </i>is meant to shake
you and unsettle you. <br/><a href=""https://soundcloud.com/locksofficial/skeletons-2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://soundcloud.com/locksofficial/skeletons-2</a></p>

<p><b>What We Need &amp; Where It Goes.<br/> </b><span>I’ve asked for help raising £2000 to cover as much of the costs as
possible, this includes:</span></p>
<p>Studio time – Recording Vocals, drums, guitars, double bass<br/>
Mixing &amp; Mastering<br/>
CD Pressing &amp; Artwork printing<br/>
PR Costs<br/>Postage &amp; packaging, we want to send you your perks!<br/>
<br/>
We are aiming to start recording in April for it to be released end of July
however if we don’t reach our end goal we will still use it to put towards all
of the above. We are going to make this EP. <br/>
<br/>
All the artwork is original and designed by myself and my dear friend Jemma
Hardingham who has designed my previous album artwork (hello, macabre) and EP
(A collection of songs about loss and leaving). One of the perks of the
campaign will be a signed print of the artwork. </p>
<p>This feels like such a great opportunity to take my music to a wider
audience, tour and then hopefully record more EPs. Without the help of this
campaign this EP most likely won’t get recorded and sent out into the world,

Mein Projekt gibt es in dieser Form noch nicht gibt. Ich selber arbeite im Medium Radio seit 1999 wobei ich auch meine Erfahrungen im kommerziellen Radio (Redaktion bei MainFM) sammeln konnte. Radios gibt es viele, jedoch nicht in der Form wie wir es gestalten werden.</div><div>Der Sender wird 24 Stunden an 365 Tagen im Jahr aus einem tatsächlich vorhandenen Studio senden. Dies wird derzeit mitten im Herzen der schönen Altstadt in 63654 Büdingen gebaut und wird dann als sogenanntes ""Offene Studio"" bezeichnet. Offenes Studio bedeutet, das wir immer eine Tür offen haben, ob für den Hörer, einen Gast oder für Menschen die nur einmal sehen möchten wie Radio gemacht wird.</div><div>Radio, ist ein Medium das auf der ganzen Welt zum täglichen Begleiter geworden ist. Leider aber zu oft geht alles im Einheitsbrei unter und man sieht die Unterschiede nicht. </div><div>Deshalb ist dies als regionaler Radiosender gegründet worden, der auf die Region bezogenes Radio macht. Das ganze läuft ehrenamtlich und wird maßgeblich durch eine Gbr.  finanziert. </div><div>Wir arbeiten in Zukunft mit Schulklassen, Vereinen und Organisationen, mit Künstlern und Bands und letztendlich mit Menschen die durch einen besonderen Beruf, ein tolles Hobby oder einer Aktion in unseren Fokus kommen. Wir gehen bei Veranstaltungen vor Ort und fangen so die Stimmung und die Reaktionen ein. Wir beziehen Stellung zum politischen Geschehen und schauen auch mal über den Tellerand von Büdingen und der Wetterau hinaus.</div><div>Das Thema Medienkompetenz soll in den Vordergrund gerückt werden, So werden wir besonders an Kinder- und Jugendliche herantreten und diese in Kursen zeigen wie Radio funktioniert.

Ich selber arbeite im Medium Radio seit 1999 wobei ich auch meine Erfahrungen im kommerziellen Radio (Redaktion bei MainFM) sammeln konnte. Radios gibt es viele, jedoch nicht in der Form wie wir es gestalten werden.Der Sender wird 24 Stunden an 365 Tagen im Jahr aus einem tatsächlich vorhandenen Studio senden. Dies wird derzeit mitten im Herzen der schönen Altstadt in 63654 Büdingen gebaut und wird dann als sogenanntes ""Offene Studio"" bezeichnet. Offenes Studio bedeutet, das wir immer eine Tür offen haben, ob für den Hörer, einen Gast oder für Menschen die nur einmal sehen möchten wie Radio gemacht wird.Radio, ist ein Medium das auf der ganzen Welt zum täglichen Begleiter geworden ist. Leider aber zu oft geht alles im Einheitsbrei unter und man sieht die Unterschiede nicht. Deshalb ist dies als regionaler Radiosender gegründet worden, der auf die Region bezogenes Radio macht. Das ganze läuft ehrenamtlich und wird maßgeblich durch eine Gbr.  finanziert. Wir arbeiten in Zukunft mit Schulklassen, Vereinen und Organisationen, mit Künstlern und Bands und letztendlich mit Menschen die durch einen besonderen Beruf, ein tolles Hobby oder einer Aktion in unseren Fokus kommen. Wir gehen bei Veranstaltungen vor Ort und fangen so die Stimmung und die Reaktionen ein. Wir beziehen Stellung zum politischen Geschehen und schauen auch mal über den Tellerand von Büdingen und der Wetterau hinaus.Das Thema Medienkompetenz soll in den Vordergrund gerückt werden, So werden wir besonders an Kinder- und Jugendliche herantreten und diese in Kursen zeigen wie Radio funktioniert. Dabei werden diese dann die gesamten Bereiche des Radios kennen lernen. Diese Kurse sind aktiv Kurse in denen die Kursteilnehmer aktiv im Studio in den einzelnen Bereichen arbeiten bis hin zur eigenen Sendung die wir dann Live senden. Diese Kurse sind natürlich kostenfrei und wir werden insbesondere mit Schulen und anderen Trägern arbeiten. Die LPR (Landesmedienanstalt) gibt hierbei entsprechende Hilfe die wir in Anspruch nehmen werden.Das alles muss natürlich finanziert werden. unsere derzeitige  Grundausstattung: 4 PC`s, 2 Mischpulte, diverse Mikrofone und andere Technik, sowie einen Satz für Interviews und Umfragen (mobiles Gerät).Da jedoch der Wunsch ist sowohl das Radio als auch den bereich Medienkompetenz so nah wie möglich an die großen Radiosender zu bringen benötige ich noch einiges an Ausstattung.Was noch fehlt:1 x Airmate (Mischpult digital für den Radiobetrieb) kosten 1890,- Euro1 x Radioautomationssystem der Marke Mairlist kosten 1785,- Euro2 x Pc incl. Monitoren für den alleinigen Betrieb der vor genannten Systemekosten rund 1300,- EuroDamit wäre eine Basis geschaffen um Radio zu machen das wirklich am Zahn der Zeit ist.Die monatlichen Kosten für Miete, Gema, GVL und Strom werden auch in Zukunft von der Gbr. getragen.Sollte der Betrag nicht erreicht werden, so können zumindest einige Teile angeschafft werden, da jeder Zugewinn sowohl das Radio als auch den Bereich der Medienkompetenz fördert.Ziel ist es ein Projekt aufzubauen, das wir weiterführen können, so wird neben dem jetzigen Verbreitungsweg (Internet) der Sprung in das regionale Kabelnetz und als fernziel auf DAB+ und UKW zu kommen. Gerne stehe ich für Fragen dazu auch via Mail unter Sendeleitung@radio-citybeat.de zur Verfügung.Ich würde mich freuen wenn ihr dies Unterstützen würdet, denn es ist mehr als ein Traum, es ist etwas wovon sehr viele Menschen etwas haben. Natürlich werde ich über jede der Anschaffungen entsprechende Rechnungen und deren Zahlungen veröffentlichen und jeder Cent wird ausschließlich in das Projekt Radio CityBeat investiert.Vielen herzlichen Dank schon an dieser Stelle sagtStefan Pfeifer",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>It doesn't get bigger than this - Vito Palumbo has built a successful career as a contemporary composer and pedagogue over twenty years. Now the famous Abbey Road Studios - perhaps the most famous recording spot in the world - will play host to an incredible experience: the <strong>LSO Records Palumbo.</strong></p>
<h3><strong><i>Realizzare un Sogno</i></strong></h3>
<p><i>In venti anni, Vito Palumbo si è creato una carriera di successo come compositore e pedagogo. Ora i famosi, forse più famosi al mondo, Abbey Road Studios ospiteranno un'incredibile esperienza: la LSO che registra Palumbo.</i><strong>Meet Vito.</strong></p>

<p><i>La settimana scorsa Vito ha scoperto che le autorità locali, una volta entusiaste sostenitrici del suo lavoro, hanno di colpo smesso di dare sostegni finanziari a tutte le imprese artistiche.

Senza aiuto finanziario, questo nuovo lavoro d'arte contemporanea Europea che è l'album di Vito non avrà modo di esistere.</i></p>

</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>Some of you may know me from the live shows and recordings I've done with singer and songwriter <b><a href=""http://www.melodygardot.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Melody Gardot</a></b>. Or you may have seen me on stage touring with 3x Grammy and Tony Award winning jazz icon and NEA Jazz Master, <b><a href=""http://www.deedeebridgewater.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dee Dee Bridgewater</a></b>. I've been a saxophonist since I was just a little kid and now have been playing professionally for nearly 20 years. It’s hard to believe that I’ve been at it for so long, but music is my life and it keeps me going every day.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>I'm thrilled and excited (and freaked out!) to share with you a project that has been weighing on my soul for some time now. I've always been asked, show after show, when I'll be releasing some music of my own. Well after years of touring and recording, I'm finally ready to take the big step. And with your help, we can turn a simple dream into a reality!</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>
</p>
<p>Making an album requires a lot of planning, patience and determination. And money! I'll need funding for:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">4 days in a top of the line recording studio (2 days to record, 1 day for fixes, 1 day for overdubs)</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Recording and rehearsal fees for 4 in-demand NYC recording and performing artists</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">3 days of rehearsals in a quality NY rehearsal studio with basic recording capabilities and music gear (amps, keyboards, etc)</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Special guest artist fees</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Engineering fees for mixing and mastering the final recording</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Album artwork</span><br/>
</li>
<li>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">Printing the physical albums and digital distribution</span><br/>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The cost of recording studio rentals, rehearsal studio rentals, mixing the album, mastering, and hiring the musicians and engineers, average to about $800 per track. “Industry standard"" for a full length album is 10 songs.  When you add in the fees and taxes for the campaign, the printing of the album, and the artwork, the costs easily add up to $10,000 - before marketing, additional merchandise, and physical shipping costs, etc.</p>
<p></p>
<p>That's where YOU come in. With your contributions, I believe we can reach and exceed this goal. Fortunately, I'll be on tour in the US, Canada, and Europe for the next 45 days with the incredible <b><a href=""http://www.melodygardot.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.melodygardot.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Melody Gardot</a></b>, spreading the word about this exciting new project. I'll be posting regular video and photo updates of the tour, the campaign, and the music creation process!</p>
<p>And to show my appreciation, I'll be offering some unique perks for every contribution, including secret recordings, saxophone lessons, opportunities to meet the band and see the recording process LIVE, exclusive interviews, album credit, and much more!</p>
<p><i>Remember! </i> Every little bit counts towards making this project the best it can be. The biggest hurdles are paying the recording studio fees and the musicians. The closer we get to our goal, the more I can do when it comes to hiring special guest artists. Even if we don't reach our final monetary goal, the money will still go towards lowering the upfront initial costs associated with making the album (i.e. studio time).</p>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Some of the biggest risks associated with a project of this nature involve scheduling. I'll be recording and rehearsing in one of the fastest cities in the world - NEW YORK! Known for looming skyscrapers and endless diversity. It's also known for it's non-stop hustle and bustle. Fortunately, there are no shortage of quality studios to use. I've been working with my musicians for many years now around the world and they are all excited to come together to make this project happen.</p>
<p>Marketing is also a challenge with any artistic process. Fortunately, the new connected world we live in offers us unique ways to approach this. Through social media and live performances, I have an opportunity to market the album to audiences around the world. This campaign is the first step in a social media effort designed to get the word out. High profile shows as a featured soloist with amazing, award-winning artists also provide a chance to promote the project to millions around the world. </p>
<p><b></b></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<div>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>Making an album is a very personal and vulnerable adventure. I've had thoughts of releasing an album in the past, but for too long was nervous about what my impact could be. I always want my audience to be able to relate to my music. I’ve been fortunate to travel around the world doing what I love and to see firsthand how music can serve as a bridge to connect people everywhere. From clubs in Tokyo, to theaters in France, to arenas in Australia, it's the most endearing feeling to have a person approach and tell you that your music has changed their mood, their day, their life. To be able to connect with people around the world despite our spoken language, through sound and energy, is a unique gift. </p>
<p>The opportunity to connect with something deeper and larger than myself is what inspires me to create music. I've been afraid for so long that my voice wouldn't reach far enough to others or that it would be rejected. I’d tell myself maybe I haven't practiced hard enough or had enough experience to say something that matters. Perhaps being a part of someone else's vision is the only way to validate what I do. But at some point I realized I had to put my personal anxieties aside and take a leap of faith. This project is that leap. And I hope it impacts you the way it has me.</p>

<h3>Some more about IRWIN</h3>
<p></p>
<p><b><a href=""http://www.irwinhall.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">IRWIN HALL</a></b> is a saxophonist, flautist and clarinetist known for his versatile stylings and melodic improvisations. His abilities have taken him around the world playing everything from jazz, swing, funk, groove, gospel, and beyond. He got his musical start on the alto saxophone in his elementary school in New Jersey at the age of 9. But when a local jazz musician came by his church a couple of years later, Irwin’s life was changed. He joined a youth program called Jazz Institute of New Jersey at the age of 11. In less than a year, Irwin was on stage performing at blues bars, organ jazz sessions, local churches, and in his early teens was ranked third nationally in the NAACP ACT-SO competition in the contemporary music category. </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>From 2003 to 2007, Irwin attended Princeton University where he majored in East Asian Studies. He became fluent in Japanese and after graduating moved to Tokyo to work at the Asahi Shimbun, Japan’s largest and oldest national newspaper as the Research Assistant to the Editor-in-Chief. While working in Tokyo, he encountered songstress <b><a href=""http://www.melodygardot.co.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Melody Gardot</a></b> who heard him play and hired him immediately to join her band.

communities not often represented at UK festivals. And, at the same 
time, we’ve extended our commitment to providing a platform for 
risk-taking female musicians who are still sorely under-represented in 
other jazz festivals. Audiences this year can look 
forward to enjoying performances by breath-taking musicians including 
Artifacts Trio, featuring Nicole Mitchell, Tomeka Reid and Mike Reed 
(US), Ingrid Laubrock and Tom Rainey (US), Sophie Agnel, Steve Noble and
 John Edwards (France/UK), Bourne Davis Kane with Paul Dunmall (UK), 
Konstrukt with Alexander Hawkins (Turkey/UK) and more. It promises to be a truly special event.  But we need your help to make it happen. In
 order to make this dream a reality, we need to raise £3,000 to access 
funding promised to us by the Arts Council. If we don't make this target, the future of the festival - which is 100% non-profit - is in serious doubt. 
The team at BAJF are already hard at work getting preparations underway,
 but, to get us up and running, we urgently need your help.  Will you make a donation today? In
 return, you'll get to be a patron of the festival, get exclusive 
merchandise, or even be lucky enough to sit in our VIP area. This year, 
you can also use your contribution to buy reduced-price early bird 
tickets for the festival, which will save you money and help bring the 
festival one step closer to happening. If you can't 
contribute you can still help us by sharing this campaign on social 
media, telling your friends and generally helping us get word out. Let’s
 do everything we can to make sure Brighton Alternative Jazz Festival is
 back to stay in 2016! For further details see the Facebook event page at https://www.facebook.com/events/1155865431142013/  And the festival's dedicated website at http://brightonalternativejazzfestival.com",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Creating music is not only a passion, but a privilege. Living in a place where so many creative minds are being thrown in the mix can only be described as a ""utopia"" where it leaves you feeling nothing less than fortunate. I've had the opportunity to live amongst many great musicians and songwriters, of whom I'm glad to call friends. Residing in this type of environment has produced not a desire to write a better song than your counterpart, but a desire to further better yourself and your storytelling abilities. </p>
<p>With this in mind, I've been working tirelessly to create something that is new and will hopefully have a lasting effect. The release of my first record was an example of me testing the waters and waiting for the moment to jump. I don't regret this at all. But since then, I have come a long way and now feel it is time to continue down this road of squalor to bring you the best I have to offer. This new record will be completely different from the first. Showcasing all new songs, it will range everywhere from folk to blues, rock, gypsy and more; all the while covering a literary field of Gothic tales to cynical love. I hope that everyone will find solace in their own interpretations.</p>
<p>Asking for help has never been a strong suit of mine, but living the life of a musician can leave you feeling hopeless sometimes. Sometimes you just have to ask. Your donations to this project will NOT be taken lightly. The cost of creating a high quality product does not come cheap and we have estimated that the goal of $10,000 will make it possible to do so. I will be working with the best minds and top notch musicians on this project and can guarantee that every donation received will go towards creating something that we can all be proud of. Without the support of family, friends and fans, I would find myself in a dark hole. </p>
<p>I thank you from the bottom of my heart to those who have been supportive. It means the world to me and I look forward to see what the future brings.</p>
<p>P.S. - Although the life of a musician/songwriter can sometimes sound gloomy, I hope the video above can show the lighter side of things.</p><p><br/></p></div>","Creating music is not only a passion, but a privilege.

<p>Creativity, passion, music, and performance are of utmost importance to me and they bring me unlimited happiness. I like to pass that happiness on to others as many ways as possible and I'd like one of those ways to be creating an album full of beloved Christmas songs for everyone to enjoy.</p>
<p>This is where you come in.</p>
<p>I can't do this without your help and support. I'm asking you to become a vital part of helping me pursue my dream and bringing happiness to others, which is something we all need right now. </p>
<p>Read ahead to find out how you can make a difference, what your donation is funding, and what kinds of fun gifts you can receive by helping out!</p>

</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p><strong>Our goal is $20,000 by August 25. </strong></p>
<p>In the interest of total transparency, here's the 411 on the financial aspects of the project:</p>
<p><strong>Where your money goes:</strong></p>
<p>Making and marketing an album of the best quality is no small feat. Every step counts. By donating to this campaign you will be helping provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Digital and print marketing</strong>: The best of the best in advertising and design for the album. My friends at <a href=""http://www.kernvision.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">KernVision</a> and <a href=""http://www.jack-design.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">JMack Design</a> will be helping with all things graphic and visual.</li>
<li>
<strong>Studio Fees</strong>: The album will be recorded over the course of a few days at <a href=""http://www.thebunkerstudio.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Bunker Studio</a> in Williamsburg.</li>
<li>
<strong>Musician Fees</strong>: I'm asking my friends, including <a href=""http://www.mtaylormusic.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Michael Taylor</a> as arranger, to play and sing with me on this project because I love them and their talent. I'm blessed to know lots of amazing professional artists who love what they do and deserve compensation for their high quality work. </li>
<li>
<strong>Mixing and Mastering Fees: </strong>The Bunker Studio has amazing mixing and mastering technicians on staff who stay with the artist throughout the recording process and after to ensure the absolute best product possible.</li>
<li>
<strong>​Album Production: </strong>This will ensure production and shipment of physical and digital copies of the album to recipients who purchase the album. This includes copyright fees for any songs which are not public domain.</li>
<li>
<strong>Post Production Advertisement and Concert: </strong>A small portion of proceeds is set aside for an album release party and publicity.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>What You Get</h3>
<p>There are lots of great rewards waiting for you when you donate to the cause! They are outlined in the Perks section (to the right). They include but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Signed Posters</li>
<li>Vinyl and CD copies of the album</li>
<li>Early release perks</li>
<li>Complimentary tickets to the album release</li>
<li>AND MORE!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We are counting on $20,000 dollars and I KNOW we can do it. But any and all donations will be put to very good use!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Music heals and enriches the soul. The holiday season is a time when people set aside their differences, show a little more kindness, and walk with an extra spring in their step. Christmas songs are a huge part in fostering that love, community, and unity. For this reason, I would like to add my voice to the list of artists who have made holiday music contributions to the world. If even one person is uplifted or changed by this album, it will all be worth it.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, I have performed in NYC and all over North America in musicals, concerts, and cabaret shows, bringing live entertainment to happy audiences of strangers and friends alike. These experiences have been so amazing, but those moments are fleeting in live performance. For this reason, I long to create an album that listeners can revisit again and again. I want to provide a way for you and the rest of the public to be able to relive those magical moments. Making an album allows anyone to relive and treasure the experience for a lifetime.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There is always an amount of risk that comes with creative projects. From budget changes to timeline shifts to technical difficulties, no artistic pursuit is without its hurdles. I have worked with my team of artists to prepare for the unexpected and create a game plan that will maximize our time and money efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>""But what if you don't make your goal?""</strong></p>
<p>In crowdfunding, there is always a fear that your goal will not be met. In the event that the goal is not reached, all donated funds will still be put to use in producing the best product with the money we receive. We will redistribute the money being put towards this project and go with Plan B to make sure you still get an album even if we don't make it to $20,000.</p>
<p><strong>However, I believe in all of you so much and I know we can make this happen!</strong></p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If anyone understands the financial constraints life can put on us on a day-to-day basis, it's me. Trust me. If you are unable to contribute at this time I totally understand. </p>
<p><strong>But! You can help in other </strong><b>ways!</b></p>
<p>In crowdfunding, word of mouth is the best tool you can have in your arsenal to make sure you reach your goal. So, if you can't make a donation, please be sure to take advantage of your social media circle by sharing this campaign with your friends, family, and any famous people you might know! (Hey, it's worth a shot!) Just getting the word out is a gigantic step in the right direction! You can simply copy and paste this URL to your various social media outlets or take advantage of IndieGoGo's sharing tools.</p>
<p>A little help goes a long way and sharing this page definitely counts!</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In 2016 former police officer and Broadway composer/playwright Christopher Smith wrote the  music and lyrics of the original song ""You Were There (A Tribute for the Fallen.)"" The song, which was first performed by choral groups, celebrates the courage and sacrifice of public service and armed service members who have died in the line of duty. This is something that has been close to Chris' heart for many years.</p>
<h3>Free for families and communities worldwide</h3>
<p>Chris believes that this song should be completely free for anyone who wants to use it in a non-profit, non-commercial way.

<p>I am Sherrie Love. I am an artist. I've been an artist for as long as I can remember. My mother worked for a school supply company when I was growing up, and when I visited the store, I ran straight for the tubes of paint, always fascinated by the multitude of colors. Although I am predominantly an oil painter and colorist, I have worked in and enjoyed many mediums. I am particularly interested in sculpture. I weld. I love foundry work and have done several bronzes. I enjoy working in clay. I am a writer and fashion designer as well. I began a line of women's clothing called Trucker's Daughter.  I studied fine art at Watkin's College of Art, Design, and Film in Nashville, Tennessee.</p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I have had the vision for many years to create The Muse, </span>a gathering place for artists, poets, musicians, and revolutionaries. I have had a gallery and studio and have curated many interesting art shows and hosted events.The Muse is the next logical step, a beer/wine/coffee bar/art gallery where people can paint, draw, write, etc. The bar will feature live music, poetry slams, fashion shows, and special events of all kinds. There will be a large studio space where art classes are held. The Muse will be an artist's community, a school, and a venue for entertainment.</p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Life as an artist can be challenging. </span>My reason for creating The Muse <span style=""background-color: initial;"">is to create a forum and outlet where people can nurture their talents  and expose their art to the world via the internet and television.</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> Because of the way our society is constructed, artists do not fit the norm.

It can be discouraging if not devastating to feel as though one's skills are not of value. That can cause a devaluation of the self, which is why I love the quote above from James Allen. It makes me feel like I do have a purpose and that I contribute value to our world.</span></p>

<p>The Muse will also be a place of learning where a variety of art classes are held. As well as a class designed for teens with autism. I was invited by the mother of an autistic teen to teach an art course. The class has evolved to include the local autistic community. One of the mothers and I are designing the curriculum together. In her wisdom and understanding of autism, she is entitling the course, Art and Life Skills.  I am certain that not only those with autism but artists also will benefit through some of the practices in this curriculum.

My name is Lauren Dair Owens and I am a singer/songwriter originally from Anchorage, Alaska (now living in Valencia, California). I am 16 years old and I have written over 50 songs and have put out two EP's. Over the last few years, I have really been trying to find myself as an artist. I have gone through many musical changes and find my music to always be evolving. From hard rock to power ballads, it seems like I've tried it all. I think I have finally found my niche. I think that this is the perfect time to show the world the real Lauren. Along with this new style, I think it is time to adapt my name into something more fitting. While I will always wear my old music on my sleeve, it is time to shed my skin into something more me. So along with my old style, I will also be dropping the 'Owens' in my name. So from now on, I will be known by 'Lauren Dair'.</p>
<p>New name, new style, same heart. I want my third EP to feel like my first one. My first EP had a sense of innocence. I hid behind this tough exterior because I didn't know how to be vulnerable. But now I know that there is nothing more beautiful than pure innocence and bare-bones honesty that rocks someones soul. They often say that third times the charm and I think that is 100% true. The last year and a half has been full of ups and downs and has made for some excellent writing material. The songs I have written tug at my heart-strings and I want to share these songs in hope that they may have the same affect on someone else.<br/></p>
<p><br/> </p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>My third EP has been written and hopefully can be recorded this summer. I see this EP as a celebration. This EP will celebrate my graduation from high school, moving into my professional musical career, and starting my life in the ""real world"". Why should you contribute? Here's a few reasons:<br/> <ul> <li>You would be helping contribute to an EP that has the possibility of having songs placed in various TV shows and movies. <br/>
</li> <li>You would be helping a young artist get their music out into the world. <br/>
</li> <li>Producing, arranging, and mastering music can be very costly. Without help, it may take a year or two to save enough money to put these songs into the world. <br/>
</li>
<li>Putting music out into the world is challenging and expensive.  I 
have written the songs but to get them arranged, produced and mastered 
can cost thousands of dollars.  I want to share my experience with my 
fans and friends! I am hoping to raise money to help cover the last 
money needed for my third EP.  My goal is to record something so amazing
 that I can continue my musical career. </li>
<li>For those of you that will donate $5, $10, $50 or more... you 
can share in my musical journey!  For each level, there will be a perk! 
 So read through and please consider a small donation.  Even a little 
bit makes a huge difference! </li>
<li>The money will be used for finishing up recording and mastering my third EP!</li>
</ul>
<ul> </ul>I am hoping to make this EP between five or six songs long. With your assistance, I will be able to fully record, produce, and master all of my tracks. As a senior in highschool/freshman in college, every extra dollar will help make this vision of mine come true. Thank you to everyone who has supported me thus far and to all of those who have yet to hear what I have to say with my music, I hope you enjoy the music! Thank you!<br/>

We'll be playing show after show after show, often in cities where we haven't a single familiar face to lock eyes with. Promoting a quirky comedy act in maybe a dozen new cities in a row is going to be hard, and that's no lie either. </li> <li>We are working to build relationships with local radio stations across the US and Canada, with our professional-quality song recordings. But getting the word out also takes money (that's where you come in!) and legwork.

It's a long story, but that show is currently in its 9th season of production under the professional stewardship of a reputed regional theatre in the midwest. Point being, the opportunities for exposure, influence and future growth presented to these artists, as ambassadors of the arts community of Portland, OR, are inspiring.    Risks & Challenges  Playing the role of two washed up country music stars and bringing silly songs to life is a LOT of fun, and that's no lie! However, the realities of a three-month tour are not always rosy.  We'll be sleeping in weird places. We'll be playing show after show after show, often in cities where we haven't a single familiar face to lock eyes with. Promoting a quirky comedy act in maybe a dozen new cities in a row is going to be hard, and that's no lie either.  We are working to build relationships with local radio stations across the US and Canada, with our professional-quality song recordings. But getting the word out also takes money (that's where you come in!) and legwork. Happily, the most effective form of advertisement is word of mouth, and one thing we've come to count on is once folks get in the door, the songs and the spirit of these characters gets 'em hooked. And that's also where you come in!    Other Ways You Can Help Can't scrounge up the cash? We get it! Want to help us even beyond your donation?  Spread the word! If you have a posse in Fresno, Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg, Edmonton or ANYWHERE who enjoys witty and irreverent original music, send them to our website (www.thefamoushaydellsisters.com), send them to a show!
Help us get booked at your neighborhood bar! Think we'd be a great fit for a music or comedy venue near you? Let us know! Share this campaign or any of our videos on your social media! Surely someone will get a kick out of something, we hope!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

0,"<div class=""routerContentStory-storyBody"" data-v-1df7bf5a=""""><p></p><p>Hi all, </p><p>We're Colour &amp; Codeine, an alternative rock band from the Reading area. We've been together for about 2 years, playing shows in our home state of PA, along with a few other states along the east coast. Last year, we released our first EP titled ""If I Die Tomorrow"", and it was a HUGE success!! This summer, we are currently scheduled to make a trip to Boston to record our next EP for a total of 10 days with producer Gary Cioffi, however, it's going to be a bit costly considering we are all attending college.

This summer, we are currently scheduled to make a trip to Boston to record our next EP for a total of 10 days with producer Gary Cioffi, however, it's going to be a bit costly considering we are all attending college.

<div>Hello, everyone.  My name is Ken Lavigne and I am a classically trained singer  from Vancouver Island, Canada. I sing and perform my style of classical crossover music to appreciative audiences all over North America. A few years ago, I fulfilled a life long goal of singing at Carnegie Hall in NYC, giving the proceeds to charity.  I realized I couldn't just wait for someone to open the doors for my career, so I took a leap of faith and made it happen for myself.  The risk and hard work helped my career immensely, but now is the time to raise the bar again - by singing at the <b>Sydney Opera House</b> in Australia! What's new this time around?  It's still a self produced show, but this time producers from <b>PBS</b> want to document the evening and present it on their network.   I need to raise the funds to make this happen.</div>

    The Impact

What does this project mean to me?
This is an enormous project and I have to get it right. I am excited, terrified, nervous, and determined that it be the very best it can be. The Sydney Opera House project will take everything I have to book the hall, find musicians and hire the technicians necessary to document the evening. It will take even more resources to fill the historic hall with an audience.  But I'm not afraid of challenges, and I am passionate about performing at great halls across the globe.  Success at this level is the career game changer I have been working towards for the past 6 years.  
   Risks & Challenges There are risks to taking on a challenge like this.
We could underestimate the challenges of producing a concert overseas and fail miserably which inevitably will result in death by humiliation (there have been known cases).  All joking aside, it wouldn't be the first time I've picked myself up, only to keep trying.
While taking on the challenge of performing at one of the world's greatest concert halls may be the biggest challenge for me to date, I have succeeded once before and know the risks are worth it.

And finally...Cross Promotion!

<p>Hi! We are Jesse &amp; Alta Keller…aka: The Prams. Our dreams of being musicians, artists and song-writers started when we were just young kiddies. Then we grew up (who knows what that really means), met each other, fell in love and our dreams merged into one - The Prams. We’ve been writing, creating and dreaming of the day when we would record an album for all of you to hear. Guess what! That day has finally come! </p>
<p>Before you read further why don't you click this link and download our latest single, ""Meant To Be"" along with a couple demos that will be on the album.  Take a list while you continue reading!</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/sh/nw4wmdvtnwf7oyz/AAC_5pNB9Y-1B-upd79QdZFFa?dl=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.dropbox.com/sh/nw4wmdvtnwf7oyz/AAC_...</a><br/></p>
<p>And continuing ... </p>
<p>We couldn’t be more excited to share our dream with you and hope that you catch a little “Pram fever”. We’ve got a bunch of songs ready for your ears to enjoy, we just need help recording them! </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need!</h3> <p></p>
<p><span>There are so many things that go into making a great album. And we want ours to be amazing.  These are the following things your generosity is allowing us to do:</span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<h4><span>Goal 1:</span></h4>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>[$3000]</b> We will be able to <i>pay our amazing musicians </i>what they are worth.  Sure we could fake it and end up with some mediocre tracks but we ain't gonna win no Grammys doin’ that. If you want the pros, they get paid for their talent.</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>[$5000]</b> MOST PEOPLE would pay for a studio but we are <i>purchasing and renting everything we need to fill the space we already have</i>.  In doing this you are really supporting our future projects too because we can do it AGAIN and AGAIN with our own studio equipment.</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>[$3000]</b> <i>Mastering and Duplication of the album</i>.  You may not even know what mastering is, but trust me it’s very important. <a href=""http://studiopros.com/tag/why-master-your-album"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">HERE</a> is some info on the process if you are interested. Duplication gets our the physical copies and online distribution.</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>[$3000]</b> <i>Promotion, Perk completion, and Fees</i>.  Promotion is key to getting our music to the people who need to hear it.  This is how you get all your stuff in the mail :)</span></li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<br/><h4>Goal 2:</h4>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>[$3000]</b> <i>Sound system</i>.  A tour would not be possible without a sound system… and a trailer! (“ohp, reference to a new Prams song”... now you really wanna hear it don't cha?)</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>[$5000]</b> Additional <i>Promotion and booking</i> costs.  We could use up the entire budget on promotion and marketing and still have more people and places to reach out to.  But $5000 will allow us to make a big dent in the local and regional music industry.</span></li>
<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><b>[$2000]</b> <i>Travel expenses</i>.  Petroleum, Ramen noodles, and sleeping bags … and the occasional shower.</span></li>
</ol>
<h3><span>What You Get!</span></h3>Below is what you can expect for supporting us. Take a look at the Perks for more details.</div><div>

</div></div>","Hi! We are Jesse & Alta Keller…aka: The Prams. Our dreams of being musicians, artists and song-writers started when we were just young kiddies. Then we grew up (who knows what that really means), met each other, fell in love and our dreams merged into one - The Prams. We’ve been writing, creating and dreaming of the day when we would record an album for all of you to hear. Guess what! That day has finally come! 
Before you read further why don't you click this link and download our latest single, ""Meant To Be"" along with a couple demos that will be on the album.  Take a list while you continue reading!
https://www.dropbox.com/sh/nw4wmdvtnwf7oyz/AAC_...
And continuing ... 
We couldn’t be more excited to share our dream with you and hope that you catch a little “Pram fever”. We’ve got a bunch of songs ready for your ears to enjoy, we just need help recording them! 
   What We Need! 
There are so many things that go into making a great album. And we want ours to be amazing.  These are the following things your generosity is allowing us to do:

Goal 1:


[$3000] We will be able to pay our amazing musicians what they are worth.  Sure we could fake it and end up with some mediocre tracks but we ain't gonna win no Grammys doin’ that. If you want the pros, they get paid for their talent.
[$5000] MOST PEOPLE would pay for a studio but we are purchasing and renting everything we need to fill the space we already have.  In doing this you are really supporting our future projects too because we can do it AGAIN and AGAIN with our own studio equipment.
[$3000] Mastering and Duplication of the album.  You may not even know what mastering is, but trust me it’s very important. HERE is some info on the process if you are interested. Duplication gets our the physical copies and online distribution.
[$3000] Promotion, Perk completion, and Fees.  Promotion is key to getting our music to the people who need to hear it.  This is how you get all your stuff in the mail :)


Goal 2:


[$3000] Sound system.  A tour would not be possible without a sound system… and a trailer! (“ohp, reference to a new Prams song”... now you really wanna hear it don't cha?)
[$5000] Additional Promotion and booking costs.  We could use up the entire budget on promotion and marketing and still have more people and places to reach out to.  But $5000 will allow us to make a big dent in the local and regional music industry.
[$2000] Travel expenses.  Petroleum, Ramen noodles, and sleeping bags … and the occasional shower.

What You Get!Below is what you can expect for supporting us. Take a look at the Perks for more details.



Thank You!
We have so many people who have supported us over the last few years.  We are absolutely overwhelmed with gratefulness.  We feel so blessed that we were created with the ability to make music that can impact peoples’ lives. Thank you, thank you, thank you for all of your support.  The only reason we can do what we love is because of YOU, our friends, our family, and our fans.  We are excited to bring you along with us on this journey the next six months.

<div>My name is Silas King IV. Im a 19 year old singer, songwriter, producer, dancer, and i really love music. You know its like i love it so much that its the only thing i think about. I remember when i first thought about being a musician i said to my self i can do this cause i saw people who were young like me dancing on T. V like Chris Brown, Usher, and most of all Michael jackson. Well since the age of 12 i have been singing and it all started when my family and i had lost are house back in 2005 and we were homeless for 2 years and i just remember feel so hopeless, but my dad would all was tell me ""What don't kill you only makes you stronger"", i remember having to take the metro bus to intermediate school for the first time in my life, i was so embarrassed and afraid but it made me tough. I remember my dad come to pick me up in taxi's and i just felt like man when is something gonna change. But through all the pain from living with my youngest sister who was 18 years old at the time and had 2 children, then to living in a small hotel for 6 months. I can say I'm am so thankful for everything that happen in my life. Through all the pain a man emerged and i discovered my self over the years. From all the moments of being alone at home and just looking at the mirror i noticed something about Silas King... ""ME!"" I am a really courageous person and fearless. I know who i am and I will go after my dreams no matter what. I thank God for always being there for me. I really do believe that all things are created by GOD through Man. He sends the ideas from HEAVEN its just up to us to grab them and cultivate the rest. See music has been a really great friend to me and its my way to express how i feel. I love music and its something i will never stop doing, cause it brings me so much joy. So the reason why I'm running this campaign is to raise enough money to be able to create an album of quality. Im going to bring that quality music back. The music like, Teddy Pendergrass, Marvin Gaye, Michael Jackson, or Luther Vandross would create. That magical music that brings you in and takes you on a journey from start to finish, with memorable melodies. That feel good music, the kind of music that makes you feel excited and you can't wait for the next song to come on. You know, that music that makes you laugh, cry, dance, be sad, be happy, makes you jump, and makes you just darn right feel good. Im gonna take my time and build my music, cause i don't think anything should be rushed. So i really appreciate each and everyone of you for supporting me and my dream and i just wanna say from the bottom of my heart, I LOVE YOU.</div> </div> <div> <h3>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>some risk and challenges i might face are, songs being deleted , computers breaking down, hard drives corrupting, but I've over come so many obstacles, they won't stop me. Im too determined and committed to who i am. I have to much class and character to let obstacles stop me. I always remember what my father tells me all the time that its not what happens to you that matters , its what you do about it, so use that same energy you use to focus on the problem use it to focus on the solution and solve the problem. With GOD all this are possible. </p>

</div></div>","Who am I?
My name is Silas King IV. Im a 19 year old singer, songwriter, producer, dancer, and i really love music. You know its like i love it so much that its the only thing i think about. I remember when i first thought about being a musician i said to my self i can do this cause i saw people who were young like me dancing on T. V like Chris Brown, Usher, and most of all Michael jackson. Well since the age of 12 i have been singing and it all started when my family and i had lost are house back in 2005 and we were homeless for 2 years and i just remember feel so hopeless, but my dad would all was tell me ""What don't kill you only makes you stronger"", i remember having to take the metro bus to intermediate school for the first time in my life, i was so embarrassed and afraid but it made me tough. I remember my dad come to pick me up in taxi's and i just felt like man when is something gonna change. But through all the pain from living with my youngest sister who was 18 years old at the time and had 2 children, then to living in a small hotel for 6 months. I can say I'm am so thankful for everything that happen in my life. Through all the pain a man emerged and i discovered my self over the years. From all the moments of being alone at home and just looking at the mirror i noticed something about Silas King... ""ME!"" I am a really courageous person and fearless. I know who i am and I will go after my dreams no matter what. I thank God for always being there for me. I really do believe that all things are created by GOD through Man. He sends the ideas from HEAVEN its just up to us to grab them and cultivate the rest. See music has been a really great friend to me and its my way to express how i feel. I love music and its something i will never stop doing, cause it brings me so much joy. So the reason why I'm running this campaign is to raise enough money to be able to create an album of quality. Im going to bring that quality music back. The music like, Teddy Pendergrass, Marvin Gaye, Michael Jackson, or Luther Vandross would create. That magical music that brings you in and takes you on a journey from start to finish, with memorable melodies. That feel good music, the kind of music that makes you feel excited and you can't wait for the next song to come on. You know, that music that makes you laugh, cry, dance, be sad, be happy, makes you jump, and makes you just darn right feel good. Im gonna take my time and build my music, cause i don't think anything should be rushed. So i really appreciate each and everyone of you for supporting me and my dream and i just wanna say from the bottom of my heart, I LOVE YOU.

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The Dirty Habits are ready to take the world by storm with their own brand of KickAss Hard Rock'n'Roll!

<p>Vocalist and Lead Guitarist Mars Trinity, a singer with a unique raspy voice, plays every night in Montreal bars. He has also self-released many albums.

And last but not least, hyperactive rhythm-guitarist William J Enhyde has written and demoed something like 50(!) songs for the project since 2015.</p>
<p>By doing it independently, The Dirty Habits keep the precious ""Master Tapes"" and remain sole proprietors of their musical destiny, making you the real boss!

""Baz"", excited with the band's energy and drive has agreed to help make the most of the songs the boys choose for the album.</p>
<p>This album will be our weapon of choice to convert KickAss Hard Rock'n'Roll lovers around the world to our cause! It's no secret that touring with an album in tow greatly improves the likelihood of drawing bigger crowds. </p>
<p>Not only our contributors will get a piece of the action, they will also support an up-and-coming band that do it their way, in control of their vision. Our contributors will also get to see the project take form from the very beginning! Kinda like watching a toddler make its first steps into the World!</p>

<p>We've also invested in getting the basic tracks really solid, money coming from our pockets. This crowdfunding campaign has been put together so we can reach our goal, keep the ball rolling.

<p>Of course, we are aware that this very exciting adventure greatly needs your help to come to life. In the event that we do not reach our goal, we have thought about different scenarios: downsizing the budget allowed to rent the studios, taking a couple of days less to complete the recordings.

<p>On the other hand, if we get more money than we've expected, we are of course going to invest it to better the final product!</p>
<h3><b>Why we need you!</b></h3>
<p>It's no secret that since MP3 revolutionized the way we think about sharing AND buying music, big record companies have become very prudent when comes the time to sign an artist. Most likely, they will let the artist finance his/their project and they will - maybe - sign them to take care of the distribution or marketing of the record. Record sales have dramatically dropped, and we're in the midst of a revolution: finding new ways to live off of our music. But there's a good side to this. By paying for his album, the artist remains proprietor of the ""Master Tapes"", enabling him to decide how his music will be marketed. The Rolling Stones own none of the records the have made from 1964 to 1972, the year they  put together their OWN record company. This doesn't mean they get no royalties, but it means that if the owner of the ""Master Tapes""  decides to put together an album of very poor quality outtakes from the vault, The Stones have no say. And who gets swindled? You, the purchaser of such indignities. It is for us a matter of respect. Let the artist decide if he wants or not to make a samba remix of his Death-metal epic record! Lol! Anyway, you get the idea. Artists and entertainers such as rock musicians have always contributed to the bettering of society. Remember the sixties? So, you would have your say in expressing that what all artists create can have a positive impact on the world we all live in, the world we all hope to live in too.</p>
<p>Whatever happens, this record will be made. We all have jobs, and have been working on this for so long that we'll take money out of our pocket to make this album for y'all! But a top-notch recording goes a long way in many ways : subtler atmospheres, more intense moments, the experience of very pleasant emotions and THE sound quality. Let's not kid ourselves: a treat for our ears!</p>
<p>Of course, it is possible to cut corners. Like producing it ourselves for instance or taping it ""live"". Lots of other independent artists chose that way : their aim is to get the music out for everybody to enjoy. </p>
<p>For those of you that want to get their hands on the album, this means more pleasure for your buck!</p>
<h3>You'd like to contribute but can't?</h3>
<p>Sure you can! By spreading the word! By using IndieGoGo's tools to do so. By asking your friends to check out our various profile pages on the web. By coming to our concerts (the money we make playing a gig is used to cover the rehearsal spot and transportation expenses, but anything that remains will go into this project.)</p>
<p>Thank you so much for having taken the time to read about our project. We hope a connexion has been made and that we will see you on tour!  The sooner, the better!</p>
<p>Rock ON!</p>

Today it is impossible to think of a cellular phone without thinking of Selfies. <b>So we thought of taking the popular Selfie idea and adding a little twist – turning it into a ""Pelfie""</b>.</p><p>Think about it, why shouldn't we give our pets a place of respect?

The end goal of the project is to upload the resulting mosaic online. However, it has become clear to us that it's not easy for everyone to expose themselves and selfies aren't suitable for everyone.As a result, we looked for an additional way that would allow those interested to identify with and participate in the project.In an age when each and every one of us has a cellular phone within reach at all times - a phone which is, in actuality, a computer that fits in the palm of our hand - big things can be made to happen by little people.We brainstormed ways to harness this power into a global social concept that would unite and emphasis our similarities and the brotherhood between us; not our differences and the things that separate us. Today it is impossible to think of a cellular phone without thinking of Selfies. So we thought of taking the popular Selfie idea and adding a little twist – turning it into a ""Pelfie"".Think about it, why shouldn't we give our pets a place of respect? Why shouldn't we put them in the center arena for a change? When was the last time someone put them on a pedestal?

Myself and my amazing team owns a company by the name of MILITIA BROADCAST PTY LTD and this is our story:</p>
<p>For years now we have been creating live musical content for sponsors and agencies; live to screens filming at international events with some livestreaming in the mix here and there. A few months ago we started filming South African live bands (in our home country) for the purpose of ONLY livestreaming their intimate hour sets live online. We did not want to have an audience in the shoot as we believed that if the artist featured had anything amazing to offer the viewer, that it should be their performance, the only variable to win the viewer over.</p>
<p>This project became so successful that our national television broadcaster approached us to licence the content created for these amazing artists. </p>
<p>The only catch is that we have to focus on the more mainstream hit artist - and as amazing as they might be, by doing so we are missing out on hundreds of mind blowing artists that will never get to be the mainstream flavour of the month.</p>
<p>There are so many amazing and talented musicians in South Africa - from Jazz, Prog-Rock, Electronica, Indigenous and my favourite, the mash-up bands that you will only ever hear playing live in a 20 pax club downtown in Braamfontein.</p>
<p>There are also many obstacles in our country as in most other countries for startup musicians and it is not just financial - the lack of true distribution platforms, a collective place where pure talent means more than pressing play on a cdj and rapping over the studio recording, connection directly to what you the FAN wants and not some fabricated fast-food music designed to be consumed by the masses.</p>
<p>We have decided to take a stab at creating (for now in South Africa only) a daily live stream in HD, from a warehouse in Johannesburg featuring the array of spectacular talent we have here, music that you are most likely never to stumble upon on youtube or soundcloud.</p>
<p>The goal in six months is to create the most amazing platform for artist on a daily basis to share their live's work with you, the fan, so that we can start the project in other countries that faces the same obstacles.</p>
<p>Currently the artist after their ""Urban Session"" performance own the content created - The Master Video Mix, The Camera separates and the Multitrack audio recordings - This in turn can create extra income for them selling DVD's at their shows - using it as promotional material and in some cases we heard that some artist, after showing these sessions to promoters, got booked for big international festivals. </p>
<p>It's funny how the abbreviation for ""Urban Sessions"" spell ""US"" - this is truly the only way this can happen. </p>
<p>Now, the only missing piece to the puzzle is YOU!</p>
<p><b>YOU can help us to provide the life-blood our music industry so desperately need.</b></p>
<p>And above all, it's going be fun as hell doing it!</p> </div> <div> <h3></h3>

<p>• We would want to work towards renting our own studio/warehouse whereby we will be able to create these livestreams from, on a daily basis, instead of renting a studio space at  a massive daily cost.</p>
<p>• Own a few of our own lights - you will see in the videos attached - we have to date bought LED tubes and wired them to strip plugs with on/off switches and flicked it on and off manually to create the look in the sessions. This is crazy to say the least but that is what we have to work with and we make do with these little makeshift solutions in the meantime - lol.</p>
<p>• Dolly and tracks - we still have to hire them in because it's damn expensive to buy even secondhand ones.</p>
<p>• Some essential backline for the artists.</p>
<p>• A small PA for the band to have the best vibe that they possibly can have during the recording. Currently this is also a massive cost centre that we have to hire in.</p>

You will be able to listen into our production meetings - what we are planning for the following week - who the bands are - how we will film the shows - the bands you would like to see etc. We are pretty good at what we do but with your creative touch we can collectively create the most mind-blowing sessions ever seen on this planet.</p>
<p>If you feel generous and believe in what we have fought tooth and nail for, then take the plunge and part with a few of your precious dollars, or donate a piece of equipment that we can save money on instead of renting it in.</p>

<p><b>YOU</b> will always be the first! </p>
<p>Weeks before we schedule the online release of the content, you will get a notification to watch the session live, before anyone else online.</p>

<p>We will send little surprise gifts to our backers - it might be a drumstick, a beautiful framed photo signed by the artists, crazy clothing and even pieces of tech that <b>YOU</b> helped us fund.</p>

</div></div>","My name is Eban Olivier. Myself and my amazing team owns a company by the name of MILITIA BROADCAST PTY LTD and this is our story:
For years now we have been creating live musical content for sponsors and agencies; live to screens filming at international events with some livestreaming in the mix here and there. A few months ago we started filming South African live bands (in our home country) for the purpose of ONLY livestreaming their intimate hour sets live online. We did not want to have an audience in the shoot as we believed that if the artist featured had anything amazing to offer the viewer, that it should be their performance, the only variable to win the viewer over.
This project became so successful that our national television broadcaster approached us to licence the content created for these amazing artists. 
The only catch is that we have to focus on the more mainstream hit artist - and as amazing as they might be, by doing so we are missing out on hundreds of mind blowing artists that will never get to be the mainstream flavour of the month.
There are so many amazing and talented musicians in South Africa - from Jazz, Prog-Rock, Electronica, Indigenous and my favourite, the mash-up bands that you will only ever hear playing live in a 20 pax club downtown in Braamfontein.
There are also many obstacles in our country as in most other countries for startup musicians and it is not just financial - the lack of true distribution platforms, a collective place where pure talent means more than pressing play on a cdj and rapping over the studio recording, connection directly to what you the FAN wants and not some fabricated fast-food music designed to be consumed by the masses.
We have decided to take a stab at creating (for now in South Africa only) a daily live stream in HD, from a warehouse in Johannesburg featuring the array of spectacular talent we have here, music that you are most likely never to stumble upon on youtube or soundcloud.
The goal in six months is to create the most amazing platform for artist on a daily basis to share their live's work with you, the fan, so that we can start the project in other countries that faces the same obstacles.
Currently the artist after their ""Urban Session"" performance own the content created - The Master Video Mix, The Camera separates and the Multitrack audio recordings - This in turn can create extra income for them selling DVD's at their shows - using it as promotional material and in some cases we heard that some artist, after showing these sessions to promoters, got booked for big international festivals. 
It's funny how the abbreviation for ""Urban Sessions"" spell ""US"" - this is truly the only way this can happen. 
Now, the only missing piece to the puzzle is YOU!
YOU can help us to provide the life-blood our music industry so desperately need.
And above all, it's going be fun as hell doing it!   

• We have a reputable track record and content with enormous traction.
• We own in full all the broadcast gear for this project, cameras, lenses, switchers, recorders  etc.
• We have additional projects throughout the year as service providers from which the profits on-goingly will fund these Urban Sessions .
• We have access to the most amazing artists that need your help to be discovered.

• We don't have hundreds of thousands of dollars to sustain this by ourselves.
• We would want to work towards renting our own studio/warehouse whereby we will be able to create these livestreams from, on a daily basis, instead of renting a studio space at  a massive daily cost.
• Own a few of our own lights - you will see in the videos attached - we have to date bought LED tubes and wired them to strip plugs with on/off switches and flicked it on and off manually to create the look in the sessions. This is crazy to say the least but that is what we have to work with and we make do with these little makeshift solutions in the meantime - lol.
• Dolly and tracks - we still have to hire them in because it's damn expensive to buy even secondhand ones.
• Some essential backline for the artists.
• A small PA for the band to have the best vibe that they possibly can have during the recording. Currently this is also a massive cost centre that we have to hire in.
  


Our vision is to include our backers in weekly ""Live Production"" meetings that we will livestream, to our backers online channel, that only they have access to. You will be able to listen into our production meetings - what we are planning for the following week - who the bands are - how we will film the shows - the bands you would like to see etc. We are pretty good at what we do but with your creative touch we can collectively create the most mind-blowing sessions ever seen on this planet.
If you feel generous and believe in what we have fought tooth and nail for, then take the plunge and part with a few of your precious dollars, or donate a piece of equipment that we can save money on instead of renting it in.
We are not fussy - the donations can be second hand - nothing a bit of elbow grease and a lick of paint can't fix :-)
MOST IMPORTANTLY:
YOU will always be the first! 
Weeks before we schedule the online release of the content, you will get a notification to watch the session live, before anyone else online.
We will REWARD our backers with live shows that no money in the world can buy you.
We will send little surprise gifts to our backers - it might be a drumstick, a beautiful framed photo signed by the artists, crazy clothing and even pieces of tech that YOU helped us fund.

We can only thank you for your time reading our story and we hope that you can see our passion and our determination.

We can't wait to have YOU onboard for the most exciting musical ride of YOUR life!
Love from South Africa!

The album incorporates quite a few genres</b>. From hip hop, to hard rock, to disco, to soul.  Yet, it all still sounds like one cohesive project. We drew on a wide range of influences, including Gangstarr, NIN, Marvin Gaye &amp; Tammi Terrell, RATM, RHCP, MIA, and Jay-Z to name a few.  <br/><br/><b>2. We sampled the original onboard audio from the Apollo 11 missions.</b> Real clips of Buzz Aldrin, Neal Armstrong, and Michael Collins traveling through space and landing on the moon. What was it like for them to see the earth from their shuttle for the first time?  How did they experience outer space?  You'll find clips of them speaking throughout the album, and hopefully will gain a closer understanding of this phenomenal achievement.  <br/><br/><b>3.

The album incorporates quite a few genres. From hip hop, to hard rock, to disco, to soul.  Yet, it all still sounds like one cohesive project. We drew on a wide range of influences, including Gangstarr, NIN, Marvin Gaye & Tammi Terrell, RATM, RHCP, MIA, and Jay-Z to name a few.  2. We sampled the original onboard audio from the Apollo 11 missions. Real clips of Buzz Aldrin, Neal Armstrong, and Michael Collins traveling through space and landing on the moon. What was it like for them to see the earth from their shuttle for the first time?  How did they experience outer space?  You'll find clips of them speaking throughout the album, and hopefully will gain a closer understanding of this phenomenal achievement.  3.

The Whiskey Crisis has a whole lot of local Ithaca talent and a whole lot of fun, and we want to roll both of those things into a new album! </p>
<p>Every one of us has had a hand in writing and arranging the music for this album, and we know you'll be just as excited about it as we are. We've got rock, we've got soul, and we've got a few surprises in store. Help us bring this album to life!</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We need $3,000 to make this happen. We need these funds to tap even more Ithaca talent to record vocals, instruments, and drums, and to and mix and master each track. We'll also use these funds to print some snazzy hard copies of the album. We've already got all these folks lined up, we just need to get started!</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>You guys, we have such great perks. Remember, <i><b>for each funding tier, you get that prize </b><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">AND all the prizes in the tiers below</span></i>. Hot damn, you can't beat that.</p>
<p>Among our perks is one we are so excited to make: <b>a brand-new, live acoustic version of our last album, Diving for Falls</b>. Think The Whiskey Crisis: Unplugged! We love to rock out, of course -- but you don't want to miss this totally different corner of our sound. </p>
<p>Just a tier or two above that, and you can also be the lucky beneficiary of <b>Julia's baking and crafting skills!</b> We're talking custom treats and designs. Professional people have paid her good money for these things, folks, and they didn't even get any music to listen to as they enjoyed their prizes! How sad for them. But not for you!</p>
<p>Now hold on to your pantaloons, because you have the chance to actually make The Whiskey Crisis <i>work just for you. </i>We're talking you can have us come do <b>an hour set just for you </b>(and hopefully some other people, because playing <i>just</i> for you might be awkward). Wanna impress people -- or maybe just your secret crush -- by throwing a killer party with a live band? We can be that band! We can even be all like, ""What?? You want to afterparty with <i>us??!!</i>"" So impressive, you are. So crushworthy.</p>
<p>Last but not least: Have you ever fantasized about having a <b>song written and recorded just for you</b>? It makes us tingle just thinking about it. We will make that fantasy a reality! We will work with you to make a song that you love -- we're talking a song with custom style, lyrics, and arrangement just for you -- and we will record it all fancy-like. How cool would it be for the rest of your life to be able to say, ""This killer band wrote and recorded a song just for me. Wanna hear it? NBD."" So impressive, you are. So cool.</p>
<p>And don't worry -- <b>even if we don't reach our goal, you still get yer prizes, and we still get to use all the funds we collect</b>.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>We think the best thing about this album is that it represents a true collaboration among Ithaca musicians. Most of our band members are songwriters, arrangers, and mainstays in the Ithaca music scene, and most of us have been recognized in local music awards by Ithaca's own Jim Catalano for our songwriting, production, vocals, and ""MVP"" work among Ithaca bands. </p>
<p>Many bands in which 3/5 are bandleaders, 4/5 are songwriters, and 5/5 are arrangers would have a hard time working together. Not The Whiskey Crisis! We have struck gold with personal and professional chemistry. We have created an album of new music that represents both our woven-together creative vision and the absolute blast we have playing music together. </p>
<p>The result will be an album unlike anything the Ithaca music scene has heard.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> There are always risks. Like, the lead singer/keyboardist might accidentally fracture her elbow roller-skating (*ahem*), or aliens might make an unscheduled stop at the recording studio and abduct our engineer. Those jerks!</p>
<p>But seriously, we've all done a lot of recording in this area, and have a good idea of what needs to happen and how. Also, we're chomping-at-the-bit committed. We can promise you your money will be well-used and that, alien attacks aside, this shiz is happening. Unless nobody donates, which would really suck.</p>
<p><br/></p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>But if you can't donate, you don't suck! Particularly if you use your voice and technology to help spread the word about the project. </p>
<p>Actually, please do this even if you can donate, you absolute rock star!</p>

</h3>
</div><p>We feel like the people who support us already do so much for us. So, to be honest, asking you for money kind of makes us feel a bit guilty. But we absolutely can't go on without financial help. We funded all of the previous bands and projects we've had on our own money and often took pride in the fact that we were a young band that could pull that off without ever having to resort to crowdfunding. But now with college, our band fund spent on the last project, Jake's child on the way, and more financial obstacles, we can't stretch our dollars any further. We need your help, and we'd be endlessly grateful if you could help us raise some money or even just some awareness. But to alleviate some of the guilt, you get more than just our eternal appreciation; you get some pretty awesome prizes as well!</p><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>We have high hopes for the support from you lovely people, and between the costs of recording/mixing/mastering/distributing an album professionally, touring in the summer, and ordering new merchandise, we're going to be set back a drastic amount in band funds, more than we can provide. Which is why we need YOUR help!</p>
<p>You've always been good to us, folks. Be it showing up to numerous venues to watch us play, sharing our music with friends, or sending us friendly and/or inspiring messages over the internet, you all have definitely proven to be kind and supportive fans, friends, and family. We hate to ask any more of you (which is why we often just give merch away at shows), but we simply can't go on with the funds we have (or lack, rather), so we'd like to ask you to help us collectively raise $1,500 by the end of March. We know that that's a lot of money, and even if we don't reach that goal, we'll still be super excited for every penny of support we do receive. Truly anything helps. But to create an incentive for your donations, we're offering up some pretty awesome prizes! Perks include:</p> <ul> <li>Advanced downloads of a song from the new album</li> <li>Merchandise bundles including CDs, stickers, t-shirts</li> <li>Boxes of assorted treasures from old bands we've been in together, including Dead Authority and Exploding Head Syndrome</li>
<li>Songs written and recorded about/for you on a CD</li>
<li>Free show attendance forever (including the possibility of rides to shows)</li>
<li>Writing and recording a song of yours (or even a cover, if you want) with us at a professional recording studio</li>
<li>Us playing a gig in your house! No location restrictions, and YOU pick the set list</li>
<li>Us being housemaids for you and making a remake of any movie you want</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>It's always weird being a band on one of these crowdfunding websites, because we aren't noble humanitarians, spreading important ideas and solutions to the world's problems, but we aren't selfish people. Being in a band is something we love. Asking people for money isn't, but since we need to in order to continue to do what we love, we swear to make it something you will love as well. We really don't see any difference between us and the audiences we perform for. We're all people, and it's a goal of ours to be utterly inclusive and have everyone interested not just be a nameless fan of The Fromps, but an important part of The Fromps. We really do always remember you people and what you do for us. Though we have our occasional eccentric traits, we truly are humbled and flattered by your continued support. So to give back, we're giving you our absolute best effort in writing, recording, touring, and interacting with you all. We really want this band to be as worth while for all of you as it is for us.</p>
<p>Plus, there are totally cool and fun prizes we can all enjoy.</p>

My friend Jamie Cruisey has let me use his studio, provided me access to amazing analogue machines and helped me produce a whole new sound.

I have been involved in music my entire life as a <a href=""www.christopherklaich.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">performer and composer</a> leading me to have a degree in music. As a babysitter/nanny and a teacher of music for all ages, I have noticed a great lack of quality music for children. <b>Children are smart </b>and thrive when given the opportunity, but it seems that often music is dumbed down with simple arrangements and terrible sounds. It seems, just because they are kids, their music is not made to the same standards as music for adults. That is just not right. They can handle and <b>DESERVE better</b>!</p>
<p>Studies show that music in children's lives <b>boosts brain power, improves memory, aids in language skills, and fosters creativity</b>. I was inspired to create an album of <b>fun, smart, quality music</b> that actually inspires children and gives them the <b>music they deserve</b>. And because there is detail and quality in this music, it is only an added bonus that<b> adults will actually enjoy</b> listening to the music as well.<b> I need help</b> to fund the remaining costs of the album so this music can be available for children and help them develop into the <b>best they can be</b>.  </p>

<p><span>This covers the following costs:</span></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>$1250</b> to finish recording and get it ready for post production. This includes hiring a few more musicians and recording some last tracks, as well as getting all of the tracks mastered, giving it that final polish.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>$2750</b> for post production costs, making the physical CDs, graphic design work for the album, registering the songs, and making sure all the legal work is taken care of.</li>
<li>
<b>$2500</b> is needed for marketing. Once the album is complete we need to let people know it is out there! This money will help buy ad space and get the word out, so this music can be heard and enjoyed by all!</li>
<li>
<b>$1000</b> contingency fund is needed as this is the first album I have produced and don't want to be surprised with unforeseen costs without the ability to cover them. </li>

I knew there would be challenges as I learn everything that is involved in self producing an album, but I thrive on challenging myself in learning and discovering. I have been working on this album for two years already, composing and arranging the music and little by little recording and getting things ready. Now that I am nearly finished with that part, I have taken a look at the ""mountain"" ahead of me and realized that I will need help to make this happen in a timely manner! I am passionate about this album and believe in the children and realize their grand future possibilities! I am only excited to see what the future brings!</p>

As a babysitter/nanny and a teacher of music for all ages, I have noticed a great lack of quality music for children. Children are smart and thrive when given the opportunity, but it seems that often music is dumbed down with simple arrangements and terrible sounds. It seems, just because they are kids, their music is not made to the same standards as music for adults. That is just not right. They can handle and DESERVE better!
Studies show that music in children's lives boosts brain power, improves memory, aids in language skills, and fosters creativity. I was inspired to create an album of fun, smart, quality music that actually inspires children and gives them the music they deserve. And because there is detail and quality in this music, it is only an added bonus that adults will actually enjoy listening to the music as well. I need help to fund the remaining costs of the album so this music can be available for children and help them develop into the best they can be.  
   What I Need & What You Get $7500 is needed to finish making this album and to get it out to the world. 
This covers the following costs:



$1250 to finish recording and get it ready for post production. This includes hiring a few more musicians and recording some last tracks, as well as getting all of the tracks mastered, giving it that final polish.


$2750 for post production costs, making the physical CDs, graphic design work for the album, registering the songs, and making sure all the legal work is taken care of.

$2500 is needed for marketing. Once the album is complete we need to let people know it is out there! This money will help buy ad space and get the word out, so this music can be heard and enjoyed by all!

$1000 contingency fund is needed as this is the first album I have produced and don't want to be surprised with unforeseen costs without the ability to cover them. 

Be sure to SELECT your PERK:
There are some great perks to contributing to this project! Everything from mp3 downloads to physical copies of the album, some even signed by yours truly! If you know me, you know I also love to craft and make food. (check out my instagram!)  I included some baked goods, knit booties and even a full on dinner party! If you have any perks you would like to see, please let me know!If unable to fully fund this project, I will use what is raised to help me get along in this journey to a completed album, even if it means a later release date as the balance of funds are raised by myself. 
On the flip side, if there is a surplus (LET'S HOPE!), I have ideas and plans to make other, follow up albums to create a whole collection of children's music with the same mission of great, fun, music for kids. My ideas span from music for nap time, to playtime melodies, to songs from around the world etc. etc. etc.! 

The Impact
 We all know children and have them in our lives. Be they our own children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews, or friend's children we want the best for them and give them every opportunity to be the best they can be. This album is for them! To boost brain power, improve memory, aid in language skills, and foster creativity!

    My Challenges This is the first album I have ever done, but to me, that is an exciting beginning! I knew there would be challenges as I learn everything that is involved in self producing an album, but I thrive on challenging myself in learning and discovering. I have been working on this album for two years already, composing and arranging the music and little by little recording and getting things ready. Now that I am nearly finished with that part, I have taken a look at the ""mountain"" ahead of me and realized that I will need help to make this happen in a timely manner! I am passionate about this album and believe in the children and realize their grand future possibilities! I am only excited to see what the future brings!

Other Ways You Can Help
 I realize that you might not be able to help financially, but you can share this with your friends, and help get the word out for this awesome project! Send emails, tweet, share on Facebook, or even carrier pigeon if it suits you!
