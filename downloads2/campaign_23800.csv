<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I've been a professional belly dance instructor and performer for over nine years. Belly dance has not only been a great source of joy and fun for me, it has also been a profound and powerful medium for helping me to effectively cope with the challenges of life by increasing my confidence, self-esteem and ability to stay grounded and centered. </p>
<p>Because belly dance has been such a powerful positive force in my life I am passionate about sharing it with everyone I can- but especially the people who need it most. As a volunteer teaching belly dance to underprivileged sixth-grade girls at a middle school in East Oakland, I saw how belly dance transformed them by increasing their self-esteem and helping them to tap into a source of strength within themselves. The program that I will receive training in is “Pomegranate SEEDs” which is an after school program that presents to youth the finest instruction in Middle Eastern Arts along with programming that promotes self-discovery and self-actualization, provides mentorship at a very high level and prepares young women for independence.</p>
<p>On completion of the SEEDs Teacher Training Certification Program I will bring this program back to Oakland and implement its twelve year successful track record mentoring young women to be healthy and strong individuals who are socially and fiscally responsible to themselves and their community. The program I will create in Oakland will accept teen girls for a full academic year and will include after-school classes 1 ½ hours each three days per week. The program will include Middle Eastern Dance instruction, specifically American Tribal Style (ATS) dance, talking circles, journal writing and presentations.</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need $1500 to cover my expenses of the teaching certification program fee and for travel expenses.</p>
<p>In exchange for your donation I am offering some great perks!</p>
<p>$40- Receive a beautiful hip scarf coin belt. I will mail to you for free (in US only) and will do my best to get you your requested color. These hip scarves are high-quality, made to last and fun to wear!</p>
<p>$100-Receive a one-hour private belly dance lesson, in person or on Skype AND also receive a beautiful belly dance hip scarf or Bellydancewear T-shirt. </p>
<p>$250-Live belly dance performance for your next special event</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Every community needs a program for this and I am excited and grateful to have the opportunity to bring it to the young women who need it most in our community. This program has hundreds of success stories of young women that were on a path of destructive behavior who transformed their lives The young women in our community need to know that we care about them and give them the knowledge and tools which we so often take for granted. If we want to change our community and our world then we need to powerfully impact women from an early age so that they can use these strategies for a lifetime.</p>
<p>This program has already been proven successful for over twelve years, so it will be easy to implement this program here with equal success and impact for years to come. </p>

Stage Left Players has a 21-year history in northeast Ohio. What started as a group of nomad actors has become an organization that prides itself on producing and performing high-quality children's and adult's shows.
A few years ago Stage Left acquired the Trinity Play House in Lisbon, Ohio, an old Presbyterian church with a 100-year history.
Since then, the costs of maintaining the building has strained Stage Left's budget.
We're looking for some help fund our 21st season!


The Impact

Every year Stage Left produces 4-5 adult shows and 3 children's shows, not including Stage Left's musical theater summer camp.

Your contributions will go towards subsidizing the cost of performing those shows including theatrical rights, set construction, costumes and more!

That allows ticket money to go towards some necessary maintenance around the play house including repaving and finishing the parking lot, having the roof inspected and repaired and other must-haves. 

Ticket money will also pay for the improvements we've already made like the new drapes, carpet and cushions we've added prior to our season opener, ""Young Frankenstein the Musical.""
Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't donate your money, please donate your time! Please share this fundraising campaign on social media! Make sure to visit our website and ""like"" our Facebook page.Also, if you're looking to volunteer at Stage Left, we'd be happy to have you!

<p>We are PearlArts Studios / STAYCEE PEARL dance project and Tuff Sound Recording. We humbly ask for your help in raising $15,000 in support of our youth programming, which we provide at no charge to our high-school students, our movement residency program, and meaningful pay for our dancers time, energy and expertise as we begin work on our new project UNTITLED: I’d rather not say.</p>
<p>In addition, we will host THE HOUSE PARTY</p>
<p>DJ Soy Sos is breaking out the throwback beats that we remember dancing to all night long with no cares in sight and the promise of waking up the next day just to do it all again. It's a party in signature PearlArts style that blends awesome music mixes, great-looking dance, and contagious energy. We'll transport you from our Point Breeze studio to a classic Brooklyn loft party. <br/></p>

<p>PearlArts Studios/STAYCEE PEARL dance project (PAS/SPdp) exists to interpret and mirror culture and community through dance and dance centered multi-media experiences. With diverse casting and programing, PAS/<span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">SPdp explores innovative and often juxtaposed conceptual possibilities while participating in meaningful collaborations with artists, educators, musicians, choreographers, and activists. PAS/SPdp is a single-choreographer driven, professional organization, that produces dynamic dance performances, layered visual and sonic artistic presentation, and programming around compelling concepts and themes relevant to current social/political and community issues. PAS/SPdp often illuminates and interprets the works of celebrated legendary and contemporary figures of the African Diaspora. Examples of such projects include OCTAVIA, which explores the life and work of famed African American Science Fiction novelist, Octavia Butler, and  ...on being..., where we focus on ideas around identity, most specifically Post-Blackness. </span></p>
<p>We started out as PearlArts: movement and sound in 2006 when asked to participate in a couples exhibition, EQUIPOISE, for the ArtUP Gallery. Since then, we have collaborated on several multi-media projects including RECOIL, a fantastical narrative installation incorporating sculpture, dance, and animated illustration, and  Named-Unnamed: the sound-installation, conceived of  boldly recognizing slain Iraqi civilians.  STAYCEE PEARL dance project (SPdp) began as an informal incubator for movement exploration in the Fall of 2009 with ten dance students. The group then settled into a cohesive six, and the new ensemble debuted its first official concert, PUPA, in 2010 at the Kelly-Strayhorn Theater. In the Fall of 2010, the Kelly-Strayhorn Theater extended a season-long residency into a longer opportunity, naming SPdp the resident dance company for the theater.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>PAS/SPdp now resides in a beautiful 2000 square foot studio with a 27x32 foot sprung dance floor, office, and space to create sound and visual art. We enjoy sharing this space with our community by offering classes and workshops lead by local, national and international artists. We also provide residency opportunities especially for movement artists who are interested in exploring collaboration with other art forms.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our  youth programming includes going into area schools daily, bringing dance and dance composition to K -8th graders, while we conduct workshops and provide performance opportunities for 9 - 12 graders in our studios. We pretty much have our in-school programs covered, thankfully, but we could use support of our youth activities including instructor pay, snacks, and expenses related to our space.</p>
<p>PearlArts offers 2 - 3 movement residency opportunities per year, which cost $8000 for us to manage and produce. Our residencies have given emerging choreographers space and time in our studio to work on choreography, collaborate with musicians and visual artists, then produce a showing of their work at our studio. We engage peers and mentors, by inviting them to a preview where residency artists are provided feedback, then we assist in marketing and provide resources and information to move their projects forward. </p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Finally, UNTITLED: I’d rather not say,  represents new artistic inspiration for our creative team. After two very heady concept-driven seasons, we are in a place to truly enjoy using movement as our conceptual focus. We will still create interesting sound, and juxtapose spacial installation and video, however, these elements will respond to the generated blocking, gestures, and vocabulary of our choreography. We are excited about the challenge of eliminating the narrative, and abstract conceptual idea, to explore  pure movement. We are then interested in why and how people move. What gestures and mannerisms are culturally inspired? Historically and culturally, how does the idea of movement and line making with the body take shape, and how does improvisation fit into this picture?</span><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>We are at the very beginning stages of this project, and will have a couple of work-in-progress viewing sessions over the next year including October 26th, 9 pm at PearlArts Studios, May 2nd 2014 at the Alloy Studios, both in Pittsburgh. UNTITLED is scheduled to premier in January of 2015.</p>Thank you in advance for any level of support!<p></p>

After two very heady concept-driven seasons, we are in a place to truly enjoy using movement as our conceptual focus. We will still create interesting sound, and juxtapose spacial installation and video, however, these elements will respond to the generated blocking, gestures, and vocabulary of our choreography. We are excited about the challenge of eliminating the narrative, and abstract conceptual idea, to explore  pure movement. We are then interested in why and how people move. What gestures and mannerisms are culturally inspired? Historically and culturally, how does the idea of movement and line making with the body take shape, and how does improvisation fit into this picture?




We are at the very beginning stages of this project, and will have a couple of work-in-progress viewing sessions over the next year including October 26th, 9 pm at PearlArts Studios, May 2nd 2014 at the Alloy Studios, both in Pittsburgh. UNTITLED is scheduled to premier in January of 2015.Thank you in advance for any level of support!
Please spread the word about our HOUSE PARTY!!!

<p><b>“What's

<p>New

<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our
inaugural production of <i>Henry V </i><span>by
William Shakespeare was nominated for three Craig Noel awards by the San
Diego Theatre Critic’s Circle. The
production <i>won two</i> awards for Outstanding
Direction and Outstanding Actor in a Lead Role, proud to be standing among the well-respected
theatres of San Diego, including the Old Globe, La Jolla Playhouse, and San Diego REP. We were included in every
single year-end, critic's-favorite list. 
And, that was just our first show!</span></p>
<p><b>
</b></p>
<p><b>This
initial success would not have been possible without generous donors like you.</b> That first, award-winning, production which
saw New Fortune smash onto the scene was entirely funded by crowd-funding right here on
IndieGoGo and by your private donations.</p>
<p><b>""If
you're so great, why do you need my gift?""</b></p>
<p><b>
</b></p>
<p>Good
question.</p>
<p>It’s
true that our founders, Richard Baird (Artistic Director), Amanda Schaar
(Managing Director) and Matt Thompson (Head of New Works), each have a wealth
of experience in the theatre, a great work ethic and a dedication to delivering
productions of the highest quality. And
it’s true that our staff, board of directors and company members all have the
same commitment to producing superior works of theatrical art. </p>
<p>But
NONE of this success would have been possible without contributions from giving
people who want and encourage excellence in the theatre, like YOU. </p>

<p><b>OUR MISSION:</b></p>
<p>New
Fortune is proudly committed to presenting “Original Classics.”</p>
<p>That is
to say, we present classical works as original, new, and relevant to today's
society, which is, sadly, too rare in the U.S. these days.<span>  Additionally, we present original works we
consider to be (or become) modern classics. Our reading series has so far
included the original, unpublished adaptations of <i>Picture of Dorian Gray </i>(adapted
from Oscar Wilde by Richard Baird), and <i>Wuthering Heights </i>(adapted from
Emily Bronte by Kirsten Brandt), as well as <i>Cellar Door (</i>a new play by
Matt Thompson).  Plus, we are <i>always </i>reading
new work submissions. (email info@newfortunetheatre.com, ATTN: New Work)</span></p>
<p><b>WHO WE ARE:</b></p>
<p>Prior to
forming <span>New Fortune Theatre Company<b>,</b>
Richard (our Artistic Director) was the Founding Artistic Director of San
Diego's Poor Players Theatre, directing over 20 productions of Shakespeare’s
(and his contemporaries’) plays. Richard went on to perform and direct in some
of the top theatres around the country, including Oregon Shakespeare Festival,
Chicago Shakespeare and The Old Globe Theatre. <i>Henry V</i> was his 48th
Shakespearean production, and he has since performed his 49th in Arizona
Theatre Company's <i>Romeo and Juliet </i>(Mercutio/Friar Lawrence/Montague). </span></p>
<p>Amanda (our
Managing Director) met Richard while performing for and serving as Director of
Educational Outreach for Southwest Shakespeare Company (where Richard was
working as Associate Artistic Director). They suited each other so well, she
went on to act in and serve as executive assistant to Richard for two of the
final productions of Poor Players (<i>Richard II &amp;</i> <i>Measure for
Measure)</i>. An accomplished actress, musician, dancer and writer, Amanda has
worked widely in both classical and experimental venues nationwide, and has
over 10 years of experience in theatre administration, including as founding
Co-Artistic Director of her own 501(c)3 Into Theatre, a children's theatre.</p>
<p>Matt (our
Head of New Works) met Richard and Amanda while performing at one of our
favorite theatres, North Coast Repertory Theatre.<span>  There, Matt served as Artistic Associate,
Literary Manager and Director of Education. Matt is also Founding Artistic
Director of Compass Theatre and Enterprise Theatre Company. A published
playwright, Matt has over twenty titles in print through Dramatic, Heuer,
Brooklyn and Eldridge Publishing. </span></p>
<p>Together,
with their extensive backgrounds spanning centuries and forms, Richard, Amanda
and Matt founded New Fortune Theatre Company; committed to presenting Original
Classics.</p>

</strong></p>
<p><strong><b>“Ok,
you sound legit. But what <i>exactly</i>
does my gift do?”</b></strong></p>
<p>Another
good question!</p>
<p>In a
recent Commission of Arts and Culture meeting Amanda met the Managing Director
of another small theatre in San Diego. Amanda asked, <i>'</i>”How do you structure your budget to pay your full cast’s union
wages?' The other MD replied, “It's hard, you know, we only have a $300,000
annual budget.” Amanda laughed, “Of course it's hard!” What Amanda didn't add
is that New Fortune’s annual budget is currently <b>less than $25,000. </b></p>
<p>Despite
that, New Fortune Theatre employed two union actors above the minimum scale,
and paid every single actor and technician. Talent is our product, and we
respect that in every way we are able.</p>
<p><b>Theatre is an expensive
proposition: </b>renting
the venue for performance, the rehearsal space, the director, the actors, the
flights, the housing, the stage manager, the assistant stage managers, the
technical director, the set designer, the set itself, the costume designer, the
costumes themselves, the lighting designer, the sound designer, marketing,
development, box office, front of house, printing, union dues, (&amp; union
mandated coffee, yes that's real), insurance, printing costs... even down to
the<i> program</i> you hold in your hands which has been painstakingly comparative-price-researched,
after being formatted, submitted to a general vote of whether or not to do the

to do the art! (We are fortunate to have the amazing Gedimin Bulat on our side <a href=""http://www.gedimin.com.)"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>www.gedimin.com.)</u></a></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>Frankly,
it's just <i>expensive </i>to produce a show. That's why you see so many productions
set in a single-set living room with a cast of 5 or 6 actors, usually
addressing one or more “hot button issues”: racism, sexism, sexuality,
addiction, violence, politics, religion, or all of the above! </p>
<p>These
sorts of plays are comparatively cheap to produce <i>and</i>they have a
built-in, button-pushed audience. </p>
<p>That's
also the reason why theatres tend to produce shows that THEY know that YOU know
like <i>Much Ado About Nothing, South Pacific </i><span>or<i> Noises Off, </i>to name a few.<span> 
</span></span></p>
<p>Now,
these are great shows! That's why they're so popular! <b>But what about all the other great shows that you may not have heard
of?</b> Odds are you won't get to hear of them, because most theatres don't
want to take the risk of you not attending. Or, if you're still reading, you
may be one of industrious aficionados who has discovered these great, lesser
known works and would love to see them produced!</p>
<p>We
want to bring them to you! We're not trying to be elitist or mysterious or
quirky here. <b>We <i>believe</i> there is great work to be done that most professionals are
dying to do, but that most producers feel uncomfortable producing. </b>They
don’t trust you to come.</p>
<p><b>W</b><b>e believe that great work should speak for
itself.</b> We
trust that you are passionate theatre-goers who are brave enough to go see
something new, especially since you’ll know any work we produce will be of
tremendous quality. <b>Quality is what we
are banking on.</b> We intend to produce work of such consistent and excellent
quality that no matter <span>whatthe
show may be called, you will <i>know </i>that it's going to be <i>great.</i> </span></p>
<p><i>T<span>hat </span></i>iswhat
your donation makes possible!</p>
<p><strong>If
you look at the acclaim we’ve received with a nearly nonexistent budget,
professionally speaking, and if you look at the award-winning company we’ve
created from thin air, you’ll know that quality is exactly what you can expect
from New Fortune Theatre Company.</strong></p>

addiction, violence, politics, religion, or all of the above! 
These
sorts of plays are comparatively cheap to produce andthey have a
built-in, button-pushed audience. 
That's
also the reason why theatres tend to produce shows that THEY know that YOU know
like Much Ado About Nothing, South Pacific or Noises Off, to name a few. 

Now,
these are great shows! That's why they're so popular! But what about all the other great shows that you may not have heard
of? Odds are you won't get to hear of them, because most theatres don't
want to take the risk of you not attending. Or, if you're still reading, you
may be one of industrious aficionados who has discovered these great, lesser
known works and would love to see them produced!
We
want to bring them to you! We're not trying to be elitist or mysterious or
quirky here. We believe there is great work to be done that most professionals are
dying to do, but that most producers feel uncomfortable producing. They
don’t trust you to come.
We believe that great work should speak for
itself. We
trust that you are passionate theatre-goers who are brave enough to go see
something new, especially since you’ll know any work we produce will be of
tremendous quality. Quality is what we
are banking on. We intend to produce work of such consistent and excellent
quality that no matter whatthe
show may be called, you will know that it's going to be great. 
That iswhat
your donation makes possible!
If
you look at the acclaim we’ve received with a nearly nonexistent budget,
professionally speaking, and if you look at the award-winning company we’ve
created from thin air, you’ll know that quality is exactly what you can expect
from New Fortune Theatre Company.

<p>
</p><p>And now, for <i>THE EXTENDED VERSION</i></p>
<p>
</p><p>WHY? - THE FINANCIALS</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our original fundraising goal for the play was to raise the cost of the venue, which is $2900.  We have already been raising money the old fashioned way, and had an amazing turnout at our fundraiser, The Pre-AFTER Valentine's Day Party, where we managed to raise $776!  So, in light of this, we are now aiming to raise the difference, which is $2124.  <br/></span></p><p>To go more into budgetary details:</p><p>When <span style=""font-weight: normal;"">theatre companies are forecasting possible revenue gained from a production, the general rule is to assume that you will fill 30% of your seating capacity on average.  We have decided to have an early bird ticket price of $17 and a regular ticket price at $20.  Using these numbers and the 60-seat capacity of the Havana Theatre our magic number for average attendance is 18 people per night.  Given that everything is really based on a guesstimate, we’re using the $17 as the ticket price for 33% of the sales of this 30% capacity forecast, and 67% at $20.  All crunched together, our possible revenue from the show equals $3,764. Our expenses for the show, on a VERY modest budget, which includes some honorariums for our crew in the $50-100 range, are $4,955. Yes, that’s correct, you’re seeing and understanding things correctly, we lose money, almost certainly, with the aforementioned projected revenues. If you are at all business-minded, or are a number cruncher at all, like my mathematician friend, you’re probably about to say, “So you don’t make anything?  You don’t even break even...I don’t know how you artists do business!”  </span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">HOWEVER!!! With raising the $776 dollars, we are now theoretically out of the RED!  But, we are still hoping to raise the rest of the cost of the venue, in case people would prefer to go hiking or skiing rather than seeing our fabulous cast scantily-clad dealing with their relationship problems!!!</span></p><p>
</p><p>Which brings us to...</p><p>WHY? - THE <i>ARTISTIC</i> WHY and IMPACT</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">As mentioned in our abridged version above, Geena Davis has been quoted as saying, “Yes, we can and will work to tell more women’s stories, listen to more women’s voices and write richer female characters”. Ironically, when I first decided that I wanted to produce AFTER as my inaugural production, it only partially had to do with the fact that the play was written by a female playwright.  And yes, at least this time around, as an actress working hard at creating a name for herself in the industry, there needed to be a female role appropriate for me. For the better, there are in fact, two roles for women and two roles for men, a fair and equitable, 50:50 split. <br/></span></p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Fate as well would play a role in leading me to my FEMALE director.<br/></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">It didn’t take long for me to think of Jessica Anne Nelson as a directorial option as we had worked together in the past and also remained friends.  Upon reading AFTER, Jessica was very excited to come on board and as an added benefit to me as a producer, Jessica was also interested in coming on board as a co-producer. Suddenly, we realized how cool this project was shaping up to be, with an originally written work by a female playwright, co-produced by two one-woman companies.  </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">As we moved forward and started involving crew we thought about how much cooler it would be to have a crew of all women, and how we could really be contributing to the independent theatre scene and changing its landscape, following in the footsteps of so many other independent theatre companies in Vancouver that have preceded us and have females at the helm: Staircase XI, Twenty Something Theatre, and delinquent theatre, to name only a few off the top of my head. The high density of females as the heads of these young theatre companies are paving the way to giving women exponentially more opportunities as they start to penetrate the higher echelons of senior theatre management and production in years to come, and we would love to contribute to that!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>WHO?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">dream of passion productions, created by Stefania Indelicato and Excavation Theatre created by Jessica Anne Nelson.  I, Stefania, am an actress, writer, producer, originally from the West Coast of Vancouver Island, who studied Theatre and Arts &amp; Culture at the University of Toronto and since graduating have been developing a career as an actress in theatre, film and television.  Jessica Anne Nelson is my co-producer, and a director, writer, producer, who graduated from the University of British Columbia. Most notably, she was recently awarded the Onsite Award for her inaugural production of Meanwhile at the 2013 Vancouver Fringe Festival. Martha Herrera-Lasso the playwright of AFTER is a writer and Master’s Graduate of the University of British Columbia who is currently working on her PhD at Berkeley.  This project marks a creative reunion of sorts amongst the three of us.  </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In the 2011 Vancouver Fringe Festival all three of us were involved in a presentation of <i>Short and Sweet: Small Plays for Big Ideas.  </i>Martha and I acted in the shows, and Jessica directed one of them.  <br/></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>WHAT?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">So what is this play about and why were we compelled to produce it?  Firstly, it has always been very exciting for me to work on original works, and to get to work on a play that is an originally-written work by a female playwright, is even more exciting when you think of the way that you are contributing to the artistic canon of work produced by female artists.  In addition, Jessica and I felt that this play was highly relatable to both men and women.  </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">It is a play about four people, a man and woman in their 20s and a man and woman in their 30s, each at different stages in their lives, who get themselves caught up in complicated and sometimes surprisingly emotional and confusing conversations, all taking place after sex.  Struggling to find their paths in life and in their interpersonal romantic relationships, this is an exploration of love and lust, intimacy and miscommunication, in a modern day society that is overwhelmed by choice.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">In coming up with this campaign, and thinking about what the play is about, a certain phrase came to my mind #firstworldproblems.  I have never been a fan of this term.  There has always been something flippant about it that didn’t sit right with me, <i>don’t we actually live in the first world...</i>.  The matter really did grow of concern to me as time went on and I had to commit to whether or not I wanted to go through with producing this play.  I have always loved being a part of work that is greater than itself, work that is for a cause, or deals with real issues, world issues if you will.  But still, I didn’t feel right about throwing away my problems as essentially being unfounded, or lacking any sort of importance due to the privileged country I’m blessed to have been born into.  </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">So, after already deciding to produce the play, Jessica and I, on a similar page with this, sought some guidance.   We came across a Huffington Post article written by psychologist Roger Covin, Ph.D., titled <i>Why We Shouldn’t Discount First World Problems</i>.  Covin addresses this phrase stating that, “...the habit of labeling many things as ""first world"" may compel us to make uninformed judgments of other people, and possibly strengthen existing misanthropic beliefs of people in general.” </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Through further research, I came across another article on <i>The Atlantic Magazine</i> official website, in an article titled, <i>What’s Wrong With #FirstWorldProblems</i>.  Written by Alexis C. Madrigal, the article cites an analysis of #FirstWorldProblems by Teju Cole, a writer, art historian, and photographer who was born in the US but raised in Nigeria.  Madrigal talks about how she was never a fan of the phrase but for some reason could never really put her finger on why.  She sought the same sort of guidance and critique, it seems, that we did and came across Cole.  Cole says, </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">""I don't like this expression ‘First World Problems’ it is false and it is condescending. Yes, Nigerians struggle with floods or infant mortality. But these same Nigerians also deal with mundane and seemingly luxurious hassles. Connectivity issues on your BlackBerry, cost of car repair, how to sync your iPad, what brand of noodles to buy: Third World problems. All the silly stuff of life doesn't disappear just because you're black and live in a poorer country. People in the richer nations need a more robust sense of the lives being lived in the darker nations. Here's a First World problem: the inability to see that others are as fully complex and as keen on technology and pleasure as you are...None of this is to deny the existence of social stratification and elite structures [in Nigeria]. There are lifestyles of the rich and famous, sure. But the interesting thing about modern technology is how socially mobile it is--quite literally. Everyone in Lagos has a phone.""<br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Ultimately, then, we hope that by presenting this piece to an audience, that we will help to give society some perspective about the way that we function in relationships today, not hoping to present these #firstworldproblems as the most difficult or complicated problems in the world, but as problems that we all share, all over the world.  Real problems, common even - in this play - problems primarily in miscommunication. <br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Of AFTER, Herrera-Lasso says, “I think miscommunication is really interesting and fun and also frustrating and inevitable, and this play is kind of about that. About miscommunication and intimacy and it being okay. So maybe by the time we leave the theatre we’ll all be a little more confused and intimate and okay with it than when we got here.”</span></p><p>IN CLOSING, </p><p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Thank you so much for your time and consideration in helping us out!  If you’re not in a position to contribute you can still help out by sharing our campaign to your social media groups using this short link <a href=""http://about.me/stefaniaindelicato"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>igg.me/at/after-play</span></a></span></p>

Greeting. Germaul Barnes/Viewsic Expressions Dance, in association with Kumble Theater, needs A Leg Up - Black Buddha Donations. Black Buddha is our first full-evening length performance premiering on September 21 and 22, 2012 at 7:30pm in the LIU-Kumble Theater. This will be a unique and exciting production featuring seven GB/VED dancers and two guest artists; Miguel Anaya - formerly with White Oak Dance Project and Nejla Yatkin - Director of NY2 Dance. Anchored within Germaul Barnes’ signature action-packed and chroeo-theatrical style, this 90-minute dance theatre piece dramatizes the true stories of an African American man's path towards enlightenment and his struggles against various forms of social prejudice. 





But we need A Leg Up to make Black Buddha possible. This project will provide opportunities & occupation to many NYC artist so we're teaming up with indiegogo.com to ask for contributions.  In exchange, we have rewards for every level of contribution from our “A Leg Up - Black Buddha” campaign.  Find one that excites you the most and jump on the GB/VED Bandwagon. Thanks! 

Budget Breakdown  


Your money goes directly to paying our amazing dancers. One-time salary for these 9 amazing dancers adds up to a whopping $8000. We need to raise money to pay them!  
Our operating budget is $17,000 for many expenses including Costumes, Set-design, Marketing, Administration fees, Travel/Transportation costs, Photographer, and Videographer.
Your contribution will directly aid the transformation of this historical theatre in Downtown Brooklyn to provide a desert backdrop for this journey. 
The estimated budget for this performance is a little over $25,000. We are humbly asking for your help in raising a little more than half of the project expenses. 
The Impact
Black Buddha is a rare blend of storytelling and dance, combining autobiographical solos with collective community issues through choreography. As we share our stories, we encourage others to share their experiences as well, often discovering that we are all telling versions of the same truth. As we face our fears and struggles, there is strength in knowing that we are not alone, and through our unique expressions, we can discover various pathways to healing and choose to become channels of enlightenment. Help us share this experience with our communtiy and ensure that these dancers get paid for their incredible time and talent.  Also, your generous support will invest in the development of GB/VED and support our Outreach Programs like the upcoming ""Brown Bag Workshop & Talk""

Colovic (concept/visuals) in collaboration with Sara Galassini (concept/solo performer), Adonis Volanakis (scholar/director), Fa Ventilato (sound artist) and Matsuo Makoto (set design/visuals) will present the Sacred Way’s first work in progress for the stage. Ms.Colovic
recently completed her thesis on the current refugee crisis on the EU borders
and joined forces with a creative team to explore the journey from life to
death to find life again.  </p>
<p>The Sacred
Way is an interdisciplinary collaborative project that begins with the vision
of a better and more just world for everyone. It reexamines the commonly adapted
exploitation of defense and security. Meaning to forward the message that not
all acts of defense and security need weapons or aggression for real solutions.
The Scared Way's goal is to challenge the preconceived ideas of equality and
interpretations of security that claim to be defending people’s human rights
and basic needs to survive. </p>
<p>The first phase of the project
focuses on the loss of life at sea for thousands of migrants fleeing for
survival and the hope of a better life. It explores the cycle of life and death
and investigates the ancient Myth of Persephone and Demeter and the Eleusinian
Mysteries as a way to approach the passage of the human soul in its journey
from light-to-darkness to find light again. The goal of the first development
phase of the Sacred Way is to create a theatrical platform that celebrates the
death of the many victims and in its future stage it aims to start an on
site-collaboration with the refugees and marginalized groups themselves so that
they can become the advocates of the cause. The UNHCR, which stands as the
official UN refugee agency, has published its 2012 review of the global trends,
which shows that we are facing today a global humanitarian crises. The official
report claims 7.6 million people were newly displaced due to conflict or
persecution, including 1.1 million new refugees and over the year an average of
23,000 persons per day left their homes to seek protection elsewhere (either
within their borders of the their country or in other countries). At the close
of 2012, 45.2 million people were forcibly displaced worldwide as a result of
persecution, conflict, generalized violence and human rights violations, of
which 15.4 million were refugees.</p>
<p>We hope
that the impact of the Sacred Way will further awareness and guide the project
into a larger scale work that will propose solutions to the issues of security,
defense and the human rights of refugees and marginalized people.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What We Need
&amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p></p>
<p>We are
asking for 1,500 USD to cover the expenses of the first work in progress, this
includes rehearsals fees and the cost of our team working on the production.
Any monies raised will be an enormous contribution to our collaborative vision

I dream of being a professional dancer. I work toward this dream by dancing approximately 15 hours per week by attending classes and rehearsing for performances at local events and outreach programs.  Since I am a Scholarship Student, I am aware my classes are gifts. Without the generosity of the CoffeeMill, I would not have had the training, skills or opportunity to audition for Joffrey Ballet School. The great honor of being accepted into the NYC program is more than me or my parents expected.In order to be competitive in the world of professional dance, professional training must be acquired. Local dance classes will not be enough to get me where I need to go.   Joffrey Ballet School has that training and atmosphere combined with a facility where greatness is achieved. I will be with dancers with like goals and skills, which will allow further growth and development.What We Need & What You GetThe summer intensive cost is approximately $1500 per week.  I have enrolled for a two week session, $3000.  This price includes Tuition, housing, fees and food. School uniforms and transportation are extra. I am hoping to raise $4000. This amount should cover all costs including transportation, uniforms, chaperon fees and meals while traveling. cost:  The two week session cost:
$1,199.00 Tuition
$998.00 Housing Fee for two weeks
$125.00 Resident Fee

<h3>WHAT</h3>
<p>""However long it takes to reach each other's shores.""</p>
<p>-Karl Jensen, <i>All This We're Each Forced Into; Private Painful Insight</i></p>
<p>YEAR OF THE SNAKE is a work conceived by three bay area artists: composer Jason Hoopes, choreographer Peiling Kao, and writer/visual artist Karl Jensen. The three elements that make up Year Of The Snake include the choreography, a physical record of the music (available November 15th), and a book compiled of writing and imagery composed specifically for this work (also available November 15th).</p>
<p>Year Of The Snake is a metaphor for “cycles of self-transformation”. In an age of hyper-competition and dependent convenience, we lose sight of the personal process and power of self-transformation, and what it takes to enter the process. What it takes to enter the process has much to do with Empathy.</p>
<p>Empathy is a practice. We have to do it for it to be. This requires vulnerability, which requires strength, through courage. These things are in turn built upon positive learning experiences, even as we accept that learning includes an element of trauma; transformation is traumatic. </p>
<p>Self-transformation concerns the application of the Will upon processes which are already in motion, and always have been. We die. Birth, death - same door. Knowing this, what do we see? Knowing this, what do we want? And what are we doing about it? We have a chance to participate in the shaping, the form, of our own transformation. But it is something we each experience alone or not at all. Such solitude is traumatic. Empathy is the Will acting to harness the inward power of Solitude and send it outward, opening toward, defining space, leaving useful room, useful because empty. Sometimes we practice Empathy in front of a mirror; be gentle with yourself as you shed skin.</p>
<p>We are reaching out to you, and you may choose to reach back in many forms, all valuable. To financially support this project is not only to help pay theater fees, promotion costs, CD and book duplication costs, and travel, but also (and most important) fees for three professional dance artists and twelve musicians. </p>
<p>As personal perspective changes, the traumatic shedding of old skin, and the acceptance of new forms of understanding, provide useful lessons for compassionately ushering in needed societal progress. You never have a finite number of chances to become, and your becoming helps others do the same. You're not invited. You're inside. It is not as important to get the message as it is to send it. You are invited. This is the spirit of this work.<br/></p>

<h3>DETAIL + THANKS</h3>
<p>The goal we've set for this public funding campaign comes with a list of spending priorities. <br/></p>
<p>The first thing we want to be sure we can do is pay the artists who helped us bring this work to life. We enlisted the aid of fifteen trained and professional local artists. They've all been so generous. Contributions will be proritized toward paying these people.</p>
<p>After artist fees, the next significant expense is the rental fee for the venue. Monies from ticket sales will also go toward this cost. Due to limited seating for thus far only a 3-day run, ticket sales alone will not cover our expenses. This is why the goal we've set here is just below the actual cost to us; it is intended to buffer income from tickets. To offer a modest thank you, the pieces of work outlined in the next financial priority are available as ""perks"" in this campaign.</p>
<p>The next financial priorities are the production costs for the musical record, the book of original text, and imagery. Year Of The Snake presents three pieces of work composed around the same theme(s). In addition to Peiling's choreographed performance, Jason has produced a physical and digital record of his hour-length score, intended to be available as a stand alone work. The seeds of this work are really found in Karl's writing, and he has produced a book of original writing and imagery composed specifically in tandem with Peiling's and Jason's visions. For perspective, the cost of music production alone will reach $2000.</p>
<p>Please note: The ""perks"" are set up in a range relationship. For instance, donate between $10 and $49 and receive the first ""perk"", donate between $50 and $75 and receive the second, etc.</p>
<p>You may also choose to decline ""perks"" and to donate anonymously. You may donate any amount you wish.</p>
<p>Please email us at yearofthesnakeoakland@gmail.com to leave a web link with us to promote on our website along with your name, in thanks. (We do reserve the right to use discretion when approving web links). </p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you for listening. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>IMPACT</h3>
<p>There are so many artists all around the world making such important work. Why support this project? That's only answerable by you. We all invest energy in many forms where ever we feel it will be best used. </p>
<p>To invest in our work is to invest in sincere and sober efforts to engage Empathy as a practice. This is something present in all three of our work trajectories; to strip away cleverness and entertainment, and touch what is pulsing just beneath the surface, what we all share. Think of an enemy - yes, them too. </p>
<p>Many technological forces we've created in the world isolate and dislocate us from each other, through the guise of convenient access. Empathy is one of the early casualties. We want to invest in its practice and value. We're all here. Cycle. Self-transformation. You have power. You are not alone in your aloneness. Neither am I in mine. </p>
<p>Thank you for listening.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>SUPPORT IN MANY FORMS</h3>
<p>If you are unable to contribute financially, you may choose to help us spread the word. Please feel free to use the Indiegogo ""share"" features and tell your friends and family about the project. We must transform alone, but no one expresses work like this alone. </p>
<p>As you share this project funding campaign with loved ones, please tell them also that they are seen and accepted.</p>

Many technological forces we've created in the world isolate and dislocate us from each other, through the guise of convenient access. Empathy is one of the early casualties. We want to invest in its practice and value. We're all here. Cycle. Self-transformation. You have power. You are not alone in your aloneness. Neither am I in mine. 
Thank you for listening.


SUPPORT IN MANY FORMS
If you are unable to contribute financially, you may choose to help us spread the word. Please feel free to use the Indiegogo ""share"" features and tell your friends and family about the project. We must transform alone, but no one expresses work like this alone. 
As you share this project funding campaign with loved ones, please tell them also that they are seen and accepted.
Thank you for listening.

<p>We were founded in 2008 with only two dancers, Founding Artistic Directors, Jennifer Alden and Valeria Cordero (Cordero has retired, succeeded by Michael J. Lopez). Now we have more than 20 dancers including a junior company made up of dancers ages 9-14. We have backgrounds in ballet, jazz, modern, contemporary, hip hop and aerial dance. In fact—we are the <b>ONLY aerial dancers</b> in North East Oklahoma! [""Swing"" by for class sometime!] </p>
<p>PDT loves to collaborate with local artists of various genres including stage combat, installation artists, video artists, actors and visual artists. We perform six-ten pieces annually, including full-length productions. We have recently enjoyed performing at 25 local elementary schools as part of the Arts &amp; Humanities Council of Tulsa's Harweldon Institute program. We are a fairly unique dance company because we all have day jobs and then rehearse at night! We believe in burning both ends to produce amazing results! [really we just believe that this integration of the real world into the theatrical affords us a unique perspective which fuels our choreography with relatable stories and themes].<br/></p>
<p><i><b>THIS CAMPAIGN! </b></i>We are so excited to have the opportunity to tour our production of ""Virus"" in Ashland, Oregon! We have been invited by the <b>""Ballet in the Park""</b> series to perform this piece and work with local dancers. The performance will be at the Butler Band shell in Ashland’s acclaimed Lithia Park as part of the Revival of “Ballet in the Park.” It is important for us as performers to get experience outside of our comfort zone and see what different areas of the country can teach us. We believe that this enriches us and pushes us further in our dance. </p>
<p><b>WITH YOUR HELP</b> we can travel to Oregon and share this piece with locals there, and give our dancers touring experience. <b>WITH YOUR HELP</b> we can afford plane tickets! [You wouldn't want us to WALK all the way there now would you?] Once we get there, we've got a great package of performing and teaching—what more could we ask for?

[except plane tickets] So thank you for reading all of this and if you take just one thing away from your reading experience today [hitchhiking is dangerous] please let it be that the arts are important. [and plane tickets are too]<br/></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are asking for $5,000 to fly our beautiful dancers to Oregon [and home again].</p>
<p>We will give you so much cool stuff! See Below!</p>
<p>If we do not reach our full goal, the amount we do raise will go to fly as many of our dancers as the cash allows. The rest will have to walk. <br/></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>We know it doesn't seem like much—but this trip is the INAUGURAL touring experience for us!  You can be one of the GROUND-BREAKING donors! We hope to tour more in the future and this will get us started. <br/><p></p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>If you are short on cash, we understand. [we are too!] So we simply ask that you contribute in another way.

Currently I am the producer, an actor and designer for this show, and wearing this many hats for the production has been difficult when we lack a big part: Funding.</p>
<p>You may be wondering ""who the heck are these kids""? And that is a perfectly appropriate question. We are a group of collegiate level actors, directors, designers, cinematographers, and theater aficionados from Rhode Island, that we have assembled to put on this amazing production, we are going by the name Mad Hat Theater (in the name of hopefully our OWN theater one day!) we are a non-profit, bunch of passionate theater hooligans who are super passionate about what we do. We have come together to put on one show before many of us continue on to grad school. We are natural-born story tellers and when we find a story to tell we simply must see it done. Thus is the case with Stephen Adly Giugus’ masterpiece ""The Last Days of Judas Iscariot"".</p>
<p>I would like to take this time to explicitly warn you, this is not ""A Christmas Carol"", this is a political show with profanity, racism, and more audaciously…questions. Was Judas at fault? Did he betray Jesus? Is there a heaven full of only good and a hell full of only bad? While this show does not attempt to answer any of these questions , it does bring up some wonderfully haunting points, not only about biblical characters, but even closer to home: does forgiveness matter if we cannot forgive ourselves?</p>
<p>This production means a lot to Ben and to me. And the fact that now we are, after all of these months of planning, so close to beginning actual production, it is a truly incredible feeling. This is a play about second chances, about forgiveness, about doing what is right, not because it is easy (because it is not) but because that is what HAS to be done. This show examines the life of a well known ""criminal,"" Judas,  and analyzes every move he has made in order to show us something because, we? We are not unlike Judas.</p>
<p>So now... What will we do with the funds? GREAT QUESTION! Here, allow us to answer: <br/>-Purchase the rights to the script <br/>-Pay for our rental space (we rent it for December-January for rehearsals, tech week and performance week(s))<br/>-Pay to rent out locations to film<br/>-Purchase scripts (not cheap for 30+ people!)<br/>-Purchase/Rent costumes, hair/wigs, makeup, accessories, set pieces, props, scenery <br/>-Rent video equipment for the filmed portions of the production such as cameras, tripods, sound equipment, reflectors etc<br/>-Rent equipment to actually SHOW the film such as: projector, cords/cables, projector screen, dolly and whatever else is necessary to show the filmed portions!<br/>-Pay for our cast and crew on film (as we will be filming for several LONG days we will need to rent a vehicle to transport all of the people and equipment, pay for meals, gas, and pay for any other help we need)<br/>-Purchasing products such as posters, programs, tickets, T-shirts, DVDs, etc</p>
<p>Our team is absolutely awesome! We have cinematographers, sound people, light people, editors, and designers. And all of those important people have staff to help them with their equipment, so as you can see, it can become very expensive very quickly!</p>
<p>We would also like to hire our photographer Alex to take stills throughout the filming process and to also take photos during the show! But he doesn't come cheap either.<br/><br/>Not to mention, it goes to all of you! When wonderful people like you donate to humble productions like ours, we want to repay you in rewards! And we shall!

in 2008 when we were working on a very non-clown project. However,
quite quickly we realised we had a shared passion for the red nose
and have been working and training together since. </p>
<p>
Over
a year ago, I nervously approached Ita about creating a brand new
clown show. We
had just finished our <i>Clown through Mask</i> training
and I really wanted to create something based on what we had
learnt. Thankfully, Ita said yes. What began as a 10 minute cabaret piece about a clown who performed some
of the most famous moments in Shakespeare developed into the show
that is now called <i>OutRAGEous Fortune</i>. The show is about a clown, Dolores, who is completely obsessed with Shakespeare. Her ultimate dream is to perform on stage at the Globe Theatre. Of course, life doesn't quite go according to plan... <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Last year we presented a first

elaborate and fine tune the show, develop our following and present it to other theatre professionals. We have both loved working on this show and it means a lot to us both personally and professionally to make and present the best version of it we can.</span></p><p>
<b>More
about us:</b></p>
<p>
I
am a clown and theatre maker.  At the age of six, I had the
first inkling that I wanted to be a clown and aside from a few detours have pursued that path.  I've studied at Lispa, a
physical theatre school based on the pedagogy of Jacques Lecoq, and
also with the brilliant Sue Morrison in <i>Clown through Mask</i>.
For the last 6 years I have worked creating, performing and
facilitating clown based performances and workshops.</p>
<p>
Ita
is a performer, writer and great storyteller. She has trained in
the <i>Gaiety School of Acting</i> and with the two world
renowned clown teachers Philippe Gaulier and Sue Morrison. Recently,
Ita wrote and performed in her own one woman show, <i>Fabulous
Females</i>.  She has also performed in numerous short films and
plays in Dublin and further afield. <br/></p>
<h3>
Dolores'
Dowry</h3>
<p>
So,
to put the show on Dolores needs to bring a dowry. €800 worth of
a dowry to be exact. What exactly will this go towards I hear you
say:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
	A
	percentage will go towards the venue costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	5
	days worth of rehearsal space (we have another five arranged with
	the support of Fringe Lab).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	Photography,
	 poster design &amp; Print.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
In
return, aside from being eternally grateful, we will be offering some great creative rewards including messages of thanks,
selfies, postcards and even performances personally from Dolores. There will also be some
discounts on tickets and workshops. </p>
<h3>
This
great stage of fools</h3>
<p>
What is the value of clown and this show today?</p><p>The clown expresses all aspects of themselves with authenticity - all their joy, rage, sorrow, beauty, disappointment... They share their vulnerability, their beautiful imperfections and humanity while maintaining a certain playfulness about their life/ predicament. By doing this, and connecting with the audience in this truth, they give them permission to recognise and express their own humanity. Now more than ever people need to be truly seen and acknowledged. This is the role of the clown.</p><p><i>OutRAGEous Fortune</i> is about ambition, enthusiasm and the desire to live our dreams. It's also about the frustration and disappointment we feel when things aren't quite going to plan. In a world that sometimes only seems to value perfection and worldly success, Dolores gives a voice to our struggles in a really fun, honest and entertaining way.  </p><h3>
Nothing
will come of Nothing</h3>
<p>
What
if you can't donate right now? Don't worry, we totally understand.
What you can do is help share this campaign or details of the show
the show itself.  And of course most importantly come along and
see us in April. Whatever way you can support us we are very
grateful.</p>

first inkling that I wanted to be a clown and aside from a few detours have pursued that path.  I've studied at Lispa, a
physical theatre school based on the pedagogy of Jacques Lecoq, and
also with the brilliant Sue Morrison in Clown through Mask.
For the last 6 years I have worked creating, performing and
facilitating clown based performances and workshops.

Ita
is a performer, writer and great storyteller. She has trained in
the Gaiety School of Acting and with the two world
renowned clown teachers Philippe Gaulier and Sue Morrison. Recently,
Ita wrote and performed in her own one woman show, Fabulous
Females.  She has also performed in numerous short films and
plays in Dublin and further afield. 

Dolores'
Dowry

So,
to put the show on Dolores needs to bring a dowry. €800 worth of
a dowry to be exact. What exactly will this go towards I hear you
say:



	A
	percentage will go towards the venue costs.



	5
	days worth of rehearsal space (we have another five arranged with
	the support of Fringe Lab).



	Photography,
	 poster design & Print.



In
return, aside from being eternally grateful, we will be offering some great creative rewards including messages of thanks,
selfies, postcards and even performances personally from Dolores. There will also be some
discounts on tickets and workshops. 

This
great stage of fools

What is the value of clown and this show today?The clown expresses all aspects of themselves with authenticity - all their joy, rage, sorrow, beauty, disappointment... They share their vulnerability, their beautiful imperfections and humanity while maintaining a certain playfulness about their life/ predicament. By doing this, and connecting with the audience in this truth, they give them permission to recognise and express their own humanity. Now more than ever people need to be truly seen and acknowledged. This is the role of the clown.OutRAGEous Fortune is about ambition, enthusiasm and the desire to live our dreams. It's also about the frustration and disappointment we feel when things aren't quite going to plan. In a world that sometimes only seems to value perfection and worldly success, Dolores gives a voice to our struggles in a really fun, honest and entertaining way.

<h3>VISION</h3>
<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;"">We are thrilled to create a theatre that puts the body and the performer in
the centre of the action. Before costumes, props and stage designs
can exist we shape the stage with  movement. Our theatre is meant to
speak visually and therefore be accessible for a broad audience, an
audience that does not need to have a particular knowledge of
literature to understand the performace. The human body is universal
and as such its language. We want to transpose this language in its
various forms, comic, tragic, grotesque and deliver classical plays
in a fresh and accessible spirit.</span></h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
</div><div>
<h3>MULTICULTURAL</h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Our
company is international and therefore multilingual. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">This is a
challenge and at the same time a chance to create a borderless
theatre which is ready to adapt to the local particularities. An
ongoing challenge for the actors of the </span><i style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Commedia</i><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">
was to study the humans, their language, forms of expression, sorrows
and hoys before playing so they could confront their audience with an
image of themselves. By these means they were able to entertain and
criticize at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Likewise
our productions shall keep their international character and, at the
same time, pick out specific regional elements. These elements enrich
our physical play which is rooted in a variety of theatrical forms of
expression such as Mime, Object Theatre and Physical Storytelling.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>

<h3>STYLE</h3>
<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;line-height: 26px;background-color: initial;"">Tragicomedy
delivers us the base. The laughter, created through pointed comic,
Slapstick and Grotesque caracters opens spaces in the audience that
make a receptive ground for the hidden tragedy. Our theatre is meant
to communicate a profound human experience, that reduces the physical
gap between audience and stage to a minimum.</span></h3>

</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Why
Molière? How study and adapt a text in 4 languages? 
</p>
<p>The
text is the literary base for the ensemble. In the creation it is
worked dramaturgically by the actors, it is stretched, torn apart,
rewritten and worked to serve the necessity of a multilingual
adaptation. <i>The Miser / L'Avare/ L'Avaro / Der Geizige/
Saituri</i> has become an image of a
society, in which the fear of material loss has become a dominant
factor in how politics and public opinion are shaped. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our
wealth is built on sand. The panic of declining life standards
threatens this structure as we witness the closing of borders and
societies, generating mistrust and hatred.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>THE MISER</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Harpagon's
household is a microcosm and a mirror of a social reality. His regime
is one of fear: a very clever tool, cold-blooded and calculated.
Costs-in-Use are being weighed up and whoever needs too much is
sorted out. Harpagon's servants work for him out of poverty, they
come from everywhere. They have fled, they are lost and do not even
understand themselves. The patron feeds them what is leftover from
the meals and makes it clear he could destroy all hopes for a better
existence by snapping his fingers. In this ambiance, hungriness and
emotion grow rapidly until they explode in a storm of despair and
love. What remains?</p>
<h3></h3>
<p></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h3>METHODS</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>In
our methods of creation the ensemble is influenced by the pedagogy of
J.Lecoq, applied through Saidi Lassaad at his school in Brussels. 
</p>
<p>The
Finno-Canadian-Italian-German troupe had the opportunity throughout
the period of two years to study with teachers and students to create
a common vocabulary of movement. This language is permanently refined
and enhanced in the creation period. All members bring in new
experiences and methods from abroad such as singing, rhythm, acting
techniques, dance, juggling...</p>
<p>Improvisation
and daily physical exercise are the base for the common creation.
Between us we exchange roles from students to teacher to generate
more knowledge. 
</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>MASK</h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The
mask is an essential element and tool for the actors. Through the
manipulation of body and voice, the mask gives important material in
the creation of the characters. Meanwhile it allows the actors to
play 2-3 different characters in one play if needed. Maskmaking and
research is a further, vital element of the troupe.</span><br/></p>
<br/><div>
<h3></h3>
<h3>PUBLIC</h3>
<p>As performers we assume our responsibility towards the audience, we are the hosts, if we play in theatres, schools, or refugee homes. </p>
<p>As we are playing we create a moment of collecitivity and discourse. We are inspired by the virtuose musicality of the <i>Commedia dell'Arte</i>, which used strong physical play as a key performative element. At the same time the <i>Commedia </i>has always been a european phenomenon, which as a wandering and travelling art form, knew no borders. We want to keep the libertarian spirit and mobility. Therefore we construct our pieces with a minimum of technique and set design, relying on the expressivity of our bodies and voices.</p>
<br/><div><br/></div>
<h3>WORKSHOP: Body Talk</h3>
<div>
<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">An immersive theatre
workshop which incorporates multiculturalism and multilingualism in
finding a common physical language.</span><br/>
</div>
<div>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our goal is to encourage
individual physical expression as we move towards an open
intercultural exchange. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Although each individual
comes with a special color, a cultural backround and a way of speaking,
the human body is universal. We all share this reality. In
investigating how the body moves, we find not only what makes us
different, but what makes all too human. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Hippana teaches specific
theatre games and exercises that enhance communication and acting skills between
students.

</div></div>","WELCOME! 

Hippana is an international travelling theatre company from Finland, Canada, Italy and Germany. We are a new generation of theatre makers who risk uncommon adaptations of classical plays and give workshops on physical theatre. Join us to make this very special event happen! LET'S GO ON TOUR 2016! 

Palermo: May

Brussels: June

Cologne: June-July



VISION
We are thrilled to create a theatre that puts the body and the performer in
the centre of the action. Before costumes, props and stage designs
can exist we shape the stage with  movement. Our theatre is meant to
speak visually and therefore be accessible for a broad audience, an
audience that does not need to have a particular knowledge of
literature to understand the performace. The human body is universal
and as such its language. We want to transpose this language in its
various forms, comic, tragic, grotesque and deliver classical plays
in a fresh and accessible spirit.



MULTICULTURAL
Our
company is international and therefore multilingual. 
This is a
challenge and at the same time a chance to create a borderless
theatre which is ready to adapt to the local particularities. An
ongoing challenge for the actors of the Commedia
was to study the humans, their language, forms of expression, sorrows
and hoys before playing so they could confront their audience with an
image of themselves. By these means they were able to entertain and
criticize at the same time.
Likewise
our productions shall keep their international character and, at the
same time, pick out specific regional elements. These elements enrich
our physical play which is rooted in a variety of theatrical forms of
expression such as Mime, Object Theatre and Physical Storytelling.




STYLE
Tragicomedy
delivers us the base. The laughter, created through pointed comic,
Slapstick and Grotesque caracters opens spaces in the audience that
make a receptive ground for the hidden tragedy. Our theatre is meant
to communicate a profound human experience, that reduces the physical
gap between audience and stage to a minimum.

MOLIÈRE AND THE COMMEDIA




Why
Molière? How study and adapt a text in 4 languages? 

The
text is the literary base for the ensemble. In the creation it is
worked dramaturgically by the actors, it is stretched, torn apart,
rewritten and worked to serve the necessity of a multilingual
adaptation. The Miser / L'Avare/ L'Avaro / Der Geizige/
Saituri has become an image of a
society, in which the fear of material loss has become a dominant
factor in how politics and public opinion are shaped. 



Our
wealth is built on sand. The panic of declining life standards
threatens this structure as we witness the closing of borders and
societies, generating mistrust and hatred.




THE MISER

Harpagon's
household is a microcosm and a mirror of a social reality. His regime
is one of fear: a very clever tool, cold-blooded and calculated.
Costs-in-Use are being weighed up and whoever needs too much is
sorted out. Harpagon's servants work for him out of poverty, they
come from everywhere. They have fled, they are lost and do not even
understand themselves. The patron feeds them what is leftover from
the meals and makes it clear he could destroy all hopes for a better
existence by snapping his fingers. In this ambiance, hungriness and
emotion grow rapidly until they explode in a storm of despair and
love. What remains?



METHODS


In
our methods of creation the ensemble is influenced by the pedagogy of
J.Lecoq, applied through Saidi Lassaad at his school in Brussels. 

The
Finno-Canadian-Italian-German troupe had the opportunity throughout
the period of two years to study with teachers and students to create
a common vocabulary of movement. This language is permanently refined
and enhanced in the creation period. All members bring in new
experiences and methods from abroad such as singing, rhythm, acting
techniques, dance, juggling...
Improvisation
and daily physical exercise are the base for the common creation.
Between us we exchange roles from students to teacher to generate
more knowledge. 




MASK
The
mask is an essential element and tool for the actors. Through the
manipulation of body and voice, the mask gives important material in
the creation of the characters. Meanwhile it allows the actors to
play 2-3 different characters in one play if needed. Maskmaking and
research is a further, vital element of the troupe.


PUBLIC
As performers we assume our responsibility towards the audience, we are the hosts, if we play in theatres, schools, or refugee homes. 
As we are playing we create a moment of collecitivity and discourse. We are inspired by the virtuose musicality of the Commedia dell'Arte, which used strong physical play as a key performative element. At the same time the Commedia has always been a european phenomenon, which as a wandering and travelling art form, knew no borders. We want to keep the libertarian spirit and mobility. Therefore we construct our pieces with a minimum of technique and set design, relying on the expressivity of our bodies and voices.

WORKSHOP: Body Talk

An immersive theatre
workshop which incorporates multiculturalism and multilingualism in
finding a common physical language.




Our goal is to encourage
individual physical expression as we move towards an open
intercultural exchange. 



Although each individual
comes with a special color, a cultural backround and a way of speaking,
the human body is universal. We all share this reality. In
investigating how the body moves, we find not only what makes us
different, but what makes all too human. 



Hippana teaches specific
theatre games and exercises that enhance communication and acting skills between
students. 



The workshop includes:


Warm-up: Fun and interactive
body and voice warm-ups


Physical Comedy: Exploring
the worlds of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton.


Voice: Playing with the tones, vibrations, intensities and differences in language. 



Movement: Physical training
for theatre and performance.

Mask: Finding the body of the mask

<div>This year Scrappy Shakespeare is producing one of Shakespeare's greatest tragedies, <i>Macbeth</i>. Taking inspiration from the spooky but fun styles of Tim Burton and early Jim Henson films, our production will be fun, inventive, and family-friendly. Join us at the <b>Denny's Plaza</b> for any of our 10 FREE performances, all at 7:30 pm on the dates below:<br/>June 23 - 26<br/>June 30 - July 1<br/>July 7 - 10 </div>
<h3>What's Scrappy Shakespeare?</h3> <p>Scrappy Shakespeare is a company that was founded on the idea that if you want to see something done, you use the resources you have and dive in head first. Last year six professional theatre artists decided that they could produce the first public, free, outdoor Shakespeare play in Spartanburg with only themselves as the team behind the entire production. We were six artists with a strong shared work history--we shared a vocabulary, a level of passion, and an excitement for the new and the challenging. So the six of us designed, directed, produced, and acted in a production of <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i> staged at the amphitheater outside of USC's George Dean Johnson, Jr. College of Business and Economics.<br/><br/>This year we're back with our second production: <i>Macbeth</i>. We've also moved to a new location, the plaza at the Denny's Building, to create greater visibility for our production.</p>
<p>In keeping with our company aesthetic, this year's production is sure to be fast, fun, and family-friendly.</p> </div> <div> <h3>More than just a production...</h3> <p>It may sound strange to say that you're contribution could change professional theatre, but we believe it could.</p>
<p>There are very few professional acting opportunities in Spartanburg, though we have many training programs at our local colleges producing quality actors ever year (our company is almost entirely made up of them). We are seeking to change that by offering quality theatrical opportunities that go beyond acting in a show and gives the company the experience of creating and producing a performance from beginning to end.. Your contribution ensures that our company can continue to grow and offer more and more of these opportunities to our local artists.</p>
<p>Professional theatre isn't something that only happens in big cities, it happens everywhere. All it demands is a group of artists who are dedicated to creating quality work and the means to compensate them for their time. With your help we are redefining ""professional"" to include artists who value living and working in smaller cities like Spartanburg.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Keep us free!</h3> <p>We think it is of great importance that we are able to offer our work to the public free of charge. Your donation ensures that we raise our money from those who are able to contribute without having to create a threshold for our audience. This means the greatest accessibility to every citizen of Spartanburg.</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>But, I don't have the money to give...</h3>

</p>
<p>Even if we don’t reach our entire goal, any funding we can get will help.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Why Hamlet? Why Now?</h3> <p></p>
<p>We all know and love Shakespeare’s classic Hamlet. Even if you were one of the less dutiful students in high school and skipped on this ubiquitous required reading, we still pick up on these references in our culture. “To be, or not to be?” is widely quoted, written into comics, or referenced in countless scripts, books, and cartoons. And it’s only one of many classic lines that we quote in our day to day whether we are aware of it or not. So why Hamlet? Why here and why now?</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Our members, Jenny Hoffman and Michelle Lawson, began this process with two ideas: 1. They wanted the script to be adapted into a three person show and 2. What if Hamlet was actually mentally ill? In fact, what if his mental illness extends into the fact that the plot of the classic tale of Hamlet is actually only happening in Hamlet’s head? From these two points, they allowed the language to flow into this new adaptation. What became of this new story was beyond anything either could imagine. It eventually evolved into a story of mental illness in our society today. Those who suffer from these diseases are not only plagued with their invisible symptoms, but with stigmas, lack of support, or well-meaning friends and family who believe these illnesses can be wished or loved away. This is why Hamlet’s story needs to be told now.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Show Dates and Locations</h3> <p>

Even if you were one of the less dutiful students in high school and skipped on this ubiquitous required reading, we still pick up on these references in our culture. “To be, or not to be?” is widely quoted, written into comics, or referenced in countless scripts, books, and cartoons. And it’s only one of many classic lines that we quote in our day to day whether we are aware of it or not. So why Hamlet? Why here and why now?


Our members, Jenny Hoffman and Michelle Lawson, began this process with two ideas: 1. They wanted the script to be adapted into a three person show and 2. What if Hamlet was actually mentally ill? In fact, what if his mental illness extends into the fact that the plot of the classic tale of Hamlet is actually only happening in Hamlet’s head? From these two points, they allowed the language to flow into this new adaptation. What became of this new story was beyond anything either could imagine. It eventually evolved into a story of mental illness in our society today. Those who suffer from these diseases are not only plagued with their invisible symptoms, but with stigmas, lack of support, or well-meaning friends and family who believe these illnesses can be wished or loved away. This is why Hamlet’s story needs to be told now.   Show Dates and Locations

As you may or may not know, I have been spending the last few years working on getting my Bachelor of Fine Arts in Theatre from the University of Arkansas. I have developed an extreme passion for live performance and I have been working as hard as I possibly can to learn the skills necessary to be a part of professional performances. I have been focusing mainly on acting, directing, and stage management but have done everything from working on costumes to lighting designs. This summer I am happy to announce that I will be taking a huge step toward my goal as I will be putting on my first professional production.

This is a huge time commitment and it is essential that I raise enough money to make it worth their while.</p><p>3. <b>Costumes</b>- Having good costumes is vital to helping an actor develop his/her character. It is also very distracting to the audience when the costume do not fit the show or actors on stage. </p><p>4. <b>Props</b>- Certain props are non-negotiable for allowing the action on stage make sense. Most of these will have to be purchased. </p><p>5. <b>Space Rental</b>- Although I will do my best to reserve the rehearsal and performance spaces for free, this may not be an option.</p><p>6. <b>Crew Wages- </b>The crew of this show will be minimal but imperative.

<b>The Other Theatre Company is excited to announce its production of Anna
Deavere Smith’s <i>Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992</i></b><br/><p></p>
<p>We are a 501(c)3 not-for-profit theatre company in Chicago dedicated to telling stories about othered populations and their allies. Our inaugural season opens with this powerful play about race in the United States. <br/></p>
<p>In 1991, four white police officers brutally beat Rodney King, a black man,
at the end of a high-speed chase in Los Angeles. In 1992, those same officers
were acquitted of the beating, despite damning video evidence witnessed around
the world. Outrage and chaos followed. </p>
<p>A solo performance transformed into a play for multiple actors, <i>Twilight</i> captures
fragments of this especially volatile moment in 20th century US race politics.
Some referred to the direct aftermath of the acquittal as the LA riots. Others
challenged that mainstream name for the explosive events, calling them
rebellions, uprisings, or disturbances. Each name imagined a different story
with different stakes. The LA uprisings became a flashpoint for conflicting
perceptions of relationships between race, ethnicity, class, power, violence,
and resistance—both in LA and the US as a whole. The play’s vivid verbatim
dialogue introduces us to many people Smith met while conducting interviews
about the uprisings.</p>
<p>But why flash back to 1992 Los Angeles in 2015 Chicago? The Other Theatre
Company wants to revisit Smith’s riveting play now, in what many US activists
have called “The Ferguson Moment.” The passionate protests against the shooting
of Michael Brown in Ferguson have drawn much-needed (though still not enough)
attention to the injustice bodies of color have often suffered at the hands of
law enforcement. While the events of Ferguson 2014 and Los Angeles 1992 are not
the same, considering them together allows us to analyze systems of injustice
as we make connections across time and space. In both LA and Ferguson, what
outsiders might have perceived as relatively isolated events were actually the
result of old, entrenched systems of power and privilege. <i>Twilight </i>is
ready for a dialogue with The Ferguson Moment and for a dialogue with the
realities of Chicago and so many other locations here and abroad, past and

Deavere Smith’s Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992
We are a 501(c)3 not-for-profit theatre company in Chicago dedicated to telling stories about othered populations and their allies. Our inaugural season opens with this powerful play about race in the United States. 
In 1991, four white police officers brutally beat Rodney King, a black man,
at the end of a high-speed chase in Los Angeles. In 1992, those same officers
were acquitted of the beating, despite damning video evidence witnessed around
the world. Outrage and chaos followed. 
A solo performance transformed into a play for multiple actors, Twilight captures
fragments of this especially volatile moment in 20th century US race politics.
Some referred to the direct aftermath of the acquittal as the LA riots. Others
challenged that mainstream name for the explosive events, calling them
rebellions, uprisings, or disturbances. Each name imagined a different story
with different stakes. The LA uprisings became a flashpoint for conflicting
perceptions of relationships between race, ethnicity, class, power, violence,
and resistance—both in LA and the US as a whole. The play’s vivid verbatim
dialogue introduces us to many people Smith met while conducting interviews
about the uprisings.
But why flash back to 1992 Los Angeles in 2015 Chicago? The Other Theatre
Company wants to revisit Smith’s riveting play now, in what many US activists
have called “The Ferguson Moment.” The passionate protests against the shooting
of Michael Brown in Ferguson have drawn much-needed (though still not enough)
attention to the injustice bodies of color have often suffered at the hands of
law enforcement. While the events of Ferguson 2014 and Los Angeles 1992 are not
the same, considering them together allows us to analyze systems of injustice
as we make connections across time and space. In both LA and Ferguson, what
outsiders might have perceived as relatively isolated events were actually the
result of old, entrenched systems of power and privilege. Twilight is
ready for a dialogue with The Ferguson Moment and for a dialogue with the
realities of Chicago and so many other locations here and abroad, past and
present. 
In the Chicago of today, our questions are many, and Twilight helps
us ask them. How can we as citizens respond to the reality that not everyone
has the luxury of viewing the police as protectors? How do people react when
they feel like their lives don’t matter? How do people make sense of violence
they witness firsthand? How do we elevate the news sources that center
marginalized voices? How do we make connections across moments without erasing
the differences between them? How can we force systemic change where change is
so urgently needed?

</p><p>Scorrere per Italiano:</p><p><b>Who are we?</b></p>
<p>Open FLR was born in 2013 out of the passion and creative output of a
group of professional dance practitioners, each of which honed their skills and
nurtured their careers abroad. From this enthusiasm this association creates
contemporary dance workshops, choreographic seminars and performative events in
Florence (Italy).</p>
<p>In an attempt to respond to the lack of professional opportunities for
local dance artists, OpenFLR laid the foundations for a long-term project as an
exchange platform in which European contemporary dancers can interact and exchange
skills with recent graduates and young Italian professionals.</p>
<p><b>What is the project?</b></p>
<p>The series of activities held in 2013 and 2014 encountered a fertile
ground for development and exchange. Open FLR hosted over 60 teachers, dancers,
and choreographers from different countries and areas of the contemporary dance
world, culminating in a Summer Choreographic Intensive held in July 2014 that presented
and premiered three brand new commissions by Natalia Horecna, Edan Gorlicki and
Riccardo Meneghini.</p>
<p>Participants and organizers agreed on the strong potential of this event
and therefore want to invest in a new edition for 2015.</p>
<p>As such, the aim of OpenFLR is to offer an educational professional
opportunity, with high professional standards, for a very accessible cost.</p>
<p>Participants will spend <strong><span>fourteen days </span></strong>together<strong> in
a dance lab </strong>led by
three internationally acclaimed choreographers <b>Joeri Dubbe, Keren Rosenberg and David Hernandez</b>.  The <strong>first two days</strong>
will consist of <strong>technique classes </strong>and workshops to allow the dancers to
meet the choreographers and vice versa. On the <strong>third day </strong>the <strong>participants will be divided in three different
groups and start a new creative process with one of the choreographers. </strong></p><p>Every day will start with a <b>technique class (either Gaga or Countertechnique®)</b> open to participants and other professional dancers.<br/></p>
<p>Open FLR will provide the space for each choreographer to experiment and
investigate their practice. By working with the dancers five hours a day, <strong><span>they
will create a work in progress to be presented at the end of the Intensive.</span></strong>
This will be a <strong>fantastic opportunity for young professionals</strong>
to experience and dive into a choreographic process, to learn different
practices, to be creative and collaborate with established choreographers. <strong>A
brief but unique professional experience!</strong></p>
<p><b>Why should you support it?</b></p>
<p>In our present economic and historical context it has become
increasingly hard to foster educational and personal growth as an artist. A
professional dancer is usually obliged to use their own funds to travel abroad
to find work or take part in auditions. To dance professionally requires
constant training to maintain mental and physical stamina and alertness, to be
prepared for opportunities as they arise, and therefore a deep knowledge of our
bodies and an ability to remain current with the trends, styles, and forms of
an ever-changing discipline is essential for success.</p>
<p>The participants (Italian and international) demonstrated great interest
and enthusiasm for the activities organized by OpenFLR. Many of those present
felt eager to contribute their own knowledge and experience creating a new
network that transcends the traditional networks of the contemporary dance
scene. </p>
<p>With your support Open FLR would be able to expand our reach to make
this experience open to any dancers no matter their back rounds or stage in career
development. The presence of more diverse group will enrich the experience for
everyone supporting their practice, travels and accommodation in Florence. </p>
<p><i>‘</i><i>The organisers of OpenFLR took their passion and tried to disseminate
their sense of generosity throughout the participants. They were very open and
available and created an amazing platform for people from different countries
to meet and come together to share their dance knowledge in a spirit of
collaboration that is not limited by economic of social conditions. It has been
an unforgettable and precious journey for me, I feel richer as a dancer and as
a person. Two weeks away from home travelling alone from Hong Kong to Europe for
the first time has been a very important moment in my life, a turning point’</i></p>

<p>Because we’re passionate about the artists behind them.  </p>
<p>TBD’s long-term commitment to
developing new pieces of theater means that we’re open to – and almost <i>expecting </i>– the nature of those pieces
to radically change over their life with us. 
So when TBD takes on a project, what we’re really doing is committing to
<b>an artist</b> in pursuit of something they care deeply about.  The artist’s passion for their project makes
us passionate about enabling its creation.  </p>

to the brink of a radically new era in its programming.  For the first time in our history, we have a
wealth of work refined by a long-term process and ready to be fully produced
AND a wealth of crazy-talented artists with projects that need and deserve TBD’s
developmental process.We're asking for your help to raise the $8,000 needed to cover the costs of originating, developing, and showcasing the six new pieces of theater (six!) that make up the backbone of our programming this spring.Why these projects?
Because we’re passionate about the artists behind them.  
TBD’s long-term commitment to
developing new pieces of theater means that we’re open to – and almost expecting – the nature of those pieces
to radically change over their life with us. 
So when TBD takes on a project, what we’re really doing is committing to
an artist in pursuit of something they care deeply about.  The artist’s passion for their project makes
us passionate about enabling its creation.  
TBD was created out of a passion for theater-making; we seek (and have
been sought out by) fellow artists as passionate about their work as we are.

The new work of Cycle 3:

Expense breakdown:

For the development side of our work this year, here's how our $8,000 are divided:





Coming soon to Cycle 3...
Later in Cycle 3, The Brewing Dept. will continue its work on projects begun during Cycle 2, producing fully realized visions of HamletGhosts, created by Cody Holliday Haefner, and Othello, edited and directed by Thomas Kapusta and featuring Jenny Vallancourt.",8.0,0,"10 Campaigns

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""></h3>
</div><p>Hello from the hearts and minds that make up the <i>Nesting</i> Cast and Crew! </p><p>We
 are an independent group of theatre artists in Portland, OR. Our goal 
is to create something authentic, innovative, scary, immersive, and 
entertaining. <i>Nesting</i> stemmed from a desire not only to 
experiment in the art of theatre, but also to explore the nature of 
fear.  Fear is a universal experience that can motivate us or cripple 
us; we're interested in exploring the moment that exists between hearing
 a noise in a dark room and deciding to enter that room anyway.</p><h3>Who are we?</h3><p><i>Nesting</i>
 is helmed by Joel Patrick Durham (Director/Creator) and Natalie 
Heikkinen (Producer/Proptress).  Nesting is collaboratively being 
written by David Bellis-Squires, Alwynn Accuardi, and Joel. There are 
our amazing performers Alwynn Accuardi, Rose Procter, Nathan Crosby and 
Murri Lazaroff-Babin. Our talented production team consists of Will 
Gebo, Corey McCarey, Kaia Maarja Hillier, Andrew Bray, Taiga Christie, 
Tyler Buswell, Clara-Liis Hillier, Kathleen Kelly, and Lexie Quandt.</p><h3>What is Nesting?</h3><p><i>Nesting</i>
 is a story which follows and explores the fears of three friends who 
move into a house in Portland together. Their new home (and new 
housemates) begin to influence their everyday lives, making their worst 
fears manifest and playing on their deepest guilty secrets. What's 
really going on in this house, and who's responsible?</p><p>One of the unique aspects of <i>Nesting</i> is
 that the story takes place over 2 nights of theatre. We will be 
performing Episodes 1 &amp; 2 for half of our showtimes and Episode 3 
&amp; 4 for the other half; catch the first and second episodes on the 
same night, then come back <span>tomorrow</span> (or the next week) for the thrilling conclusion. Those who love to binge-watch Netflix can get their live theatre fix.</p><p>Nesting will be presented at the extremely intimate Shoebox Theatre (2110 SE 10th Ave, Portland, OR 97214), opening March 4th 2016, and will run until March 26th.<br/></p><p>As a semi-improvised show (the main plot line is scripted but the actors discover and create dialogue), <i>Nesting </i>will
 be a different experience for each performance. That means new jokes, 
new stories, and new ways of unraveling the mystery might appear <i>each show!</i>  We want to thrill you and leave you asking juicy questions, but we need your help to make this happen!</p><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Have we piqued your fancy? Do you want to help? Awesome!  Here's the situation:</p>
<p>Since
 we're an independent production, all money that we raise goes directly

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We
 want to thrill you, but we also want to keep innovating. We believe 
theatre should be accessible to everyone and entertaining as hell!  We 
want to continue to create entertainment that's fun to watch and fun to 
make.  There are hundreds of young, talented artists in Portland, OR who
 are looking for opportunities to exercise their creativity; when the 
opportunities can't be found, we believe in creating them!  We 
are so excited and thankful for our production team that is willing to 
dive into this project. These are passionate, local, energized and 
professional theatre artists who do what they do because they want to 
make unique, authentic theatre that resonates with a younger audience. We
 care about our community and we care about you.  Feel free to come to 
the show and let us know what you think and what you want to see in the 
future!</p>

</div></div>","Hello from the hearts and minds that make up the Nesting Cast and Crew! We
 are an independent group of theatre artists in Portland, OR. Our goal 
is to create something authentic, innovative, scary, immersive, and 
entertaining. Nesting stemmed from a desire not only to 
experiment in the art of theatre, but also to explore the nature of 
fear.  Fear is a universal experience that can motivate us or cripple 
us; we're interested in exploring the moment that exists between hearing
 a noise in a dark room and deciding to enter that room anyway.Who are we?Nesting
 is helmed by Joel Patrick Durham (Director/Creator) and Natalie 
Heikkinen (Producer/Proptress).  Nesting is collaboratively being 
written by David Bellis-Squires, Alwynn Accuardi, and Joel. There are 
our amazing performers Alwynn Accuardi, Rose Procter, Nathan Crosby and 
Murri Lazaroff-Babin. Our talented production team consists of Will 
Gebo, Corey McCarey, Kaia Maarja Hillier, Andrew Bray, Taiga Christie, 
Tyler Buswell, Clara-Liis Hillier, Kathleen Kelly, and Lexie Quandt.What is Nesting?Nesting
 is a story which follows and explores the fears of three friends who 
move into a house in Portland together. Their new home (and new 
housemates) begin to influence their everyday lives, making their worst 
fears manifest and playing on their deepest guilty secrets. What's 
really going on in this house, and who's responsible?One of the unique aspects of Nesting is
 that the story takes place over 2 nights of theatre. We will be 
performing Episodes 1 & 2 for half of our showtimes and Episode 3 
& 4 for the other half; catch the first and second episodes on the 
same night, then come back tomorrow (or the next week) for the thrilling conclusion. Those who love to binge-watch Netflix can get their live theatre fix.Nesting will be presented at the extremely intimate Shoebox Theatre (2110 SE 10th Ave, Portland, OR 97214), opening March 4th 2016, and will run until March 26th.As a semi-improvised show (the main plot line is scripted but the actors discover and create dialogue), Nesting will
 be a different experience for each performance. That means new jokes, 
new stories, and new ways of unraveling the mystery might appear each show!  We want to thrill you and leave you asking juicy questions, but we need your help to make this happen!
What We Need & What You Get
Have we piqued your fancy? Do you want to help? Awesome!  Here's the situation:
Since
 we're an independent production, all money that we raise goes directly 
to the people and materials we need to make this show incredible!  We're
 looking at the cost of renting a theater for rehearsals and 
performances; paying our designers, director, actors and writers; and 
we're in need of set, costumes, and prop materials.  We have the 
optimism and the passion, but we knew we would need to reach out and ask
 for help from the community.
We've 
applied for the RACC Project Grant (fingers crossed!) and we have some 
very wonderful friends who have agreed to sponsor certain budget items. 
 However, in order to make this production what it really deserves to 
be, we need a bit more help!
So we've set our Indiegogo goal at $5,000!  Can you help us reach it in 30 days?
Whether you spread the word by posting to your FacePage or donate a little cash, ANY help you can give is super valuable.
If you have room in your budget to donate some funds, anything from $1 up will result in your name listed on our website as well as on display in the lobby of the theatre, and grant access to behind-the-scenes photos and videos!

 you can spare a little more, we have some fun perk packages to show our

It’s about getting a group of people together and tapping into our child-like desire to create—to try new things and see what works and what doesn’t.

In Gruesome Playground Injuries, Rajiv Joseph takes us on an intriguing thirty-year journey of friendship, nostalgia, attachment, love, pain and maybe a little healing. Ultimately, the play shows us snapshots of Doug and Kayleen’s (Dougleen’s) friendship as their lives collide time and time again in surprising and often destructive ways, leaving them to investigate both their emotional and physical scars.</p><p>One of our goals in embarking on this project is to put on this play limiting ourselves to use only what we had immediately on hand, in our own homes or things we could borrow. This can be seen as both a practical means of keeping a low budget but also as an artistic challenge and a means to investigate our own memories and scars. Ultimately, Kayleen and Doug represent all of us as human beings. We hope this project to be a way for all of us—creative team, cast and audience—to learn more about ourselves.

<p>We are <b>Fujiwhara</b>, a theater company. </p>
<p>About us: Writer/Director Moze
Halperin first approached Actor/Director Anna Eisley in 2013 to perform
alongside him in his play <i>Kisses From Fujiwhara</i>, which premiered at the
Catalyst Festival at Dixon Place. In it, Moze asked Anna to play a
paralytic/partially mummified drag queen whose grasp on the English language is
limited to one repeating song – strangely, this wasn't too unpleasant an
experience, so they decided to continue working together. </p>

sort of in a mall, and sort of on an invisible train-track. This play is a
spin on immersive theater, wherein characters are displayed as works of art on
pedestals making audience members incidental gallery goers. Up until now,
all our theatrical undertakings have been scripted before rehearsal processes. For this project, </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">however, we thought a different approach may be more
beneficial. The dialogue, set in a mall, will partially be developed with the

dialogue with heavy physical strictures, essentially disembodying the speech. Without

<p>Our debut production will be performed
at The Woods Cooperative in Ridgewood, Queens – where we both live and aspire
to contribute to a burgeoning performing arts scene. Our aim, after this piece,
is to continue Fujiwhara performances that, after this Indiegogo nest-egg, will
be financially self-sufficient. The small funding bump we're asking for is crucial to our project
– to pay for rehearsals, a week's rent at the Woods Cooperative, and to create
a set resembling the interior of a gallery. We realize experimental theater is no cash cow, but it is both emotionally and intellectually
sustaining for us, and entirely indispensable in this sense; hopefully what we bring to the
community will reciprocate the same sense of emotional, intellectual and even comedic fulfillment. We can't do it without a little help. </p>

About the Project“Ever wondered if out there, in a faraway universe, lives another you? This haunting new work presents two dramatically different versions of one life. Set in parallel worlds, manipulated by a chorus of mysterious figures, Two blends the unsettling surreal with the familiar hyper-real. Written by local playwright Kat Taddei and directed by Colette Habel.”Two, a new stage-play, was an exciting challenge to write for emerging playwright Kat Taddei. The first full draft of the script was completed just this spring, for a third-year workshop at the University of Victoria, under the mentorship of award-winning playwright Charles Tidler.At the end of her spring workshop, Kat received an e-mail from Charles encouraging her to submit the script to local producer Catador Theatre, who were seeking an original play for production at the 2015 Victoria Fringe Festival. Anxiously, Kat did so... and a week later, Two was selected! Soon, Colette Habel, a fifth-year UVic student wrapping up her double-major in Theatre and Creative Writing, was on board as Two’s director. Together, Colette and Kat were lucky to find and cast a group of talented young people just as excited as them about bringing Two to life-- a group almost entirely made up theatre students, an amazing mixpot from the Victoria Academy of Dramatic Arts, UVic’s Phoenix, and Capilano University in Vancouver.

<p>This October 18 <strong><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/wasabasscoburlesque?directed_target_id=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wasabassco</a></strong> will present a full theatrical burlesque adaptation of/ homage to <strong>1933's King Kong</strong> at <strong><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/thebellhouseny?directed_target_id=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Bell House</a>,</strong> in celebration of the film's <strong>80th anniversary</strong>. This will be the most elaborate production we have EVER mounted, with extensive costumes, props, set pieces, group numbers, and of course re-creating the great Kong himself. <br/><br/> Short on time but big on enthusiasm, we’ve launched this indiegogo campaign to help raise the necessary budget to properly execute the production.</p>
<p><strong>WHO WE ARE</strong></p>
<p>Since its birth in 2004, New York based <strong>Wasabassco</strong> has produced finely-curated burlesque and nightlife events throughout New York City and across the nation, bringing their singular extravaganzas to diverse and enthusiastic audiences. Named by the Travel Channel as one of the Ten Best Burlesque Shows in the world, Wasabassco provides couple-friendly, risqué entertainment featuring internationally-recognized burlesque and variety performers from New York City and around the globe.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT WE NEED </strong></p>
<p>Funds raised for this production will first and foremost go toward the realization of Kong himself, as it will take great expense, craftsmanship, and skill to create the illusion of the 8th Wonder of The World in Wasabassco style for the Bell House stage.</p>
<p>In addition to Kong, it is our aim to create environments for the Kong adventure: the original props, costumes, and set pieces - including a New York cityscape - required to bring our tale to life. </p>
<p>Last and certainly not least, we must pay all of the fine performers, costumers, writers and creators involved in the show for their contributions, rehearsal time, onstage appearance, and talent.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT YOU GET</strong></p>
<p>We’re against the idea of begging for donations for a for-profit venture - so for the most part we are simply using this campaign to sell <strong>advance tickets</strong> and packages to the show itself. <strong>VIP</strong> <strong>tickets</strong> will include access to a pre show party and a talk from world recognized Kong expert <strong>Ray Morton.</strong></p>
<p>Additionally, many friends and supporters of Wasabassco have stepped forward to offer services in an effort to see this project realized, and those incentives are included as well.</p>
<p>For those who want to donate smaller sums or are unable to purchase tickets to the show we are offering items and perks that we would gladly sell elsewhere as merch.</p>
<p><strong>THE IMPACT</strong></p>
<p>With your help we can create one of the most amazing nights of live entertainment  ever seen, an event people will talk about for years – and, with the creation of the props and costumes already achieved, a show we can repeat in the future.</p>

<p>I have been creating and performing dance-theatre work since 1996. As I grow up, so does the work, and more importantly the scale of the work. For <strong>The Atomic Weight of Happiness</strong> I gathered an amazing team together to make an amazing production.</p>
<p>It's about personal mythology and how family lore shapes us, emotional equations - trying to dissect and understand feelings, and a proposal on how to save the world. (Happiness and innovation combined are a magical mix!)</p>
<p>The show opened in Toronto in April 2011, then got a remount for 600 grade 7's at Theatre Direct in the fall of 2012 and now we are getting to tour it!</p>
<p>We're heading to the UNO Festival in Victoria at the end of May, to Ottawa in August, and later to Peterborough and Vaughn. In the interim I am working to get more touring dates and intend to be touring this work for a while. The set is incredible and needs special attention to not get busted when it travels. We need to build shipping cases for it. Once we do, we'll be able to go anywhere!</p>
<p>Please consider making a contribution to help us share this great show with as many people as possible.</p>

<p>Expect Theatre/ Spark Collective</p>
<p><strong>Playwrights &amp; Directors:</strong> Created and Directed by Chris Tolley and Laura Mullin</p>
<p><strong>Cast:</strong> Beryl Bain, Lauren Brotman, Quancetia Hamilton, Muoi Nene, Peyson Rock, David Shelley, Richard Stewart</p>
<p><strong>Team:</strong> Dramaturg: Erica Kopyto, Musical Director: Andrew Craig,Choreographer: Nicola Pantin, Lighting Design &amp; Production Manager: Arun Srinivasan, Design: Ed Hanley, Light Designer &amp; Production Manager, Set &amp; Costume Designer: Jackie Chau, Stage Manager: Laura Cournoyea, Organist: Richard Wilson, Fight Choreographer: Simon Fon</p>
<p> <strong>AWAKE</strong></p>
<p>A hit of the 2011 Fringe, AWAKE is a new theatre piece that takes you deep into the heart of one of Toronto’s most violent neighbourhoods. Set in the funeral of a victim of gun violence, AWAKE explores the ripple effect of gangs within a community. Developed over three years, the production portrays the lives of those living in an “at risk” community. The show is made up entirely from interviews with mothers who have lost sons, gang members, outreach workers, and police. The show combines verbatim theatre, dance, video, and gospel music. Expect Theatre is raising funds to produce the World Premiere of AWAKE as part of the Next Stage Festival at the Factory Theatre from Jan. 2 – 13, 2012.</p>
<p>Expect Theatre receives operating funds from the Ontario Arts Council that go towards this project. AWAKE has also been supported by the Toronto Arts Council. This show was work shopped at the Toronto Fringe Festival in 2011. It was the second highest grossing show out of the 155 shows presented that year.</p>
<p> <strong>Impact of Support</strong></p>
<p>If you assist with the production of this project, you will be supporting a unique and ambitious multidisciplinary theatre piece that delves into the root cause and effect of gun violence in Toronto. It also helps illuminate the challenges faced by some living in priority communities. Everyone has a stake in putting a stop to the growing issue of gang and gun violence in our city. We cannot stop this violence without better understanding the reasons behind it.</p>
<p><strong>Production costs to be covered by this campaign include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Payment of artist fees such as actors, designers and crew</li>
<li>Production costs (sets, video rental and costumes)</li>
<li>Video rental</li>
<li>Marketing and Outreach</li>
<li>Tickets for youth in priority neighbourhoods</li>

</li>
</ul><p><strong>About Expect Theatre:</strong></p>
<p>Laura Mullin and Chris Tolley founded Expect Theatre in 1996. Expect is dedicated to producing cutting edge, original, multi-disciplinary productions that explore modern urban life.</p>
<p>One of Mullin and Tolley’s most notable productions is Romeo/Juliet REMIXED, which premiered at the 2002 Toronto Fringe Festival and was remounted in Toronto in 2004 and Philadelphia in 2005. This interactive theatrical piece earned five Dora Award nominations and received international media attention, including a feature in the prestigious New York publication, Stage Directions. One of their more recent pieces, STATIC (an interactive exploration of fear) premiered as part of Harbourfront’s 2007 New World Stage Festival and was a winner of the inaugural Harbourfront FreshGround Commissioning Program. Other work with Harbourfront Centre includes writing and directing the show One Sleepless Night for the International Festival of Authors. Additional writing credits include the CBC commissioned radio drama, The Tunnel Runners (CBC Radio 1 and Radio Canada International). In 2011 the company presented a workshop production of AWAKE at the Toronto Fringe Festival. The show was the second highest grossing show of the Fringe.</p>
<p> In 2005, Mullin and Tolley founded the urbanNOISE Festival, an annual event that brings some of Canada’s top urban artists into the Jamestown community to shine the spotlight on this unique area. To date, over 10,000 people have attended this Festival that featured such performers as Drake and Jully Black. In 2009, Expect was shortlisted for a Toronto Arts Foundation Award.</p>

 AWAKE
A hit of the 2011 Fringe, AWAKE is a new theatre piece that takes you deep into the heart of one of Toronto’s most violent neighbourhoods. Set in the funeral of a victim of gun violence, AWAKE explores the ripple effect of gangs within a community. Developed over three years, the production portrays the lives of those living in an “at risk” community. The show is made up entirely from interviews with mothers who have lost sons, gang members, outreach workers, and police. The show combines verbatim theatre, dance, video, and gospel music. Expect Theatre is raising funds to produce the World Premiere of AWAKE as part of the Next Stage Festival at the Factory Theatre from Jan. 2 – 13, 2012.
Expect Theatre receives operating funds from the Ontario Arts Council that go towards this project. AWAKE has also been supported by the Toronto Arts Council. This show was work shopped at the Toronto Fringe Festival in 2011. It was the second highest grossing show out of the 155 shows presented that year.
 Impact of Support
If you assist with the production of this project, you will be supporting a unique and ambitious multidisciplinary theatre piece that delves into the root cause and effect of gun violence in Toronto. It also helps illuminate the challenges faced by some living in priority communities. Everyone has a stake in putting a stop to the growing issue of gang and gun violence in our city. We cannot stop this violence without better understanding the reasons behind it.
Production costs to be covered by this campaign include:

Payment of artist fees such as actors, designers and crew
Production costs (sets, video rental and costumes)
Video rental
Marketing and Outreach
Tickets for youth in priority neighbourhoods


About Expect Theatre:
Laura Mullin and Chris Tolley founded Expect Theatre in 1996. Expect is dedicated to producing cutting edge, original, multi-disciplinary productions that explore modern urban life.
One of Mullin and Tolley’s most notable productions is Romeo/Juliet REMIXED, which premiered at the 2002 Toronto Fringe Festival and was remounted in Toronto in 2004 and Philadelphia in 2005. This interactive theatrical piece earned five Dora Award nominations and received international media attention, including a feature in the prestigious New York publication, Stage Directions. One of their more recent pieces, STATIC (an interactive exploration of fear) premiered as part of Harbourfront’s 2007 New World Stage Festival and was a winner of the inaugural Harbourfront FreshGround Commissioning Program. Other work with Harbourfront Centre includes writing and directing the show One Sleepless Night for the International Festival of Authors. Additional writing credits include the CBC commissioned radio drama, The Tunnel Runners (CBC Radio 1 and Radio Canada International). In 2011 the company presented a workshop production of AWAKE at the Toronto Fringe Festival. The show was the second highest grossing show of the Fringe.
 In 2005, Mullin and Tolley founded the urbanNOISE Festival, an annual event that brings some of Canada’s top urban artists into the Jamestown community to shine the spotlight on this unique area. To date, over 10,000 people have attended this Festival that featured such performers as Drake and Jully Black. In 2009, Expect was shortlisted for a Toronto Arts Foundation Award.

Virtual
Box Office was created in 2010 by a team of performing arts and IT
professionals, as a fee-free service to the performing arts community, a sector
that has struggled with commercial ticketing agencies who’s fees are
prohibitive to smaller organizations.
Our team
is made up entirely of volunteers, from a number of backgrounds, including:

Online Ticketing Solutions
Event Management
Theatre Production and Direction
Software Development
Retail Merchandising and Marketing
Data Center Management
Cloud Computing design and development
Whilst we
hope one day to grow Virtual Box Office into a commercial entity, today it does
not pay any salaries or employees. All development and costs are borne by the
team.
Virtual
Box Office offers fee-based ticketing to commercial organizations, which helps fund
(although not entirely, yet!) development and hosting. This lets us offer free
ticketing services (event management, ticket sales, product sales, marketing
and other capabilities) to smaller, non-professional performing arts organizations, including:

Not-for-profit organizations and charities
Non-professional theatre companies
Community based theatre companies
Whilst
our team is based in Australia (that place at the bottom of our planet!), our
users and clients are global – from the US to Europe!  We really live in a small world…
Why are we creating this product? Are we mad to
make it free?
Yes, in a way we are mad! Mad at other ticketing agencies
and providers reaping excessive profits by double-dipping on booking fees.  It doesn’t really cost us much to host the
environment (a rack of equipment, so cloud services and a bit of internet…), so
today as we grow we can cover the costs ourselves…
But why
do we do this? Why are we spending our valuable spare time creating this?

Non-commercial organizations, in particular schools and amateur performing arts

     upwards of 7-15% of the ticket price
We want to see

The Impact – Seating Allocation
One of
the key aspects of any ticketing system is ‘seating allocation’ – the capability
of organizations to create online seating plans, and let their consumers or

The
commercial players in the ticketing industry offer these services for an
exorbitant rate, but we believe we can offer it very, very cost effectively.
The
purpose of this pitch is to raise funds to develop this aspect of the system,

What We Need & What You Get
We’re
looking to raise up to $25,000.   This
will help us to cover software development costs for this project, and fund the

Odd Man Out Productions is presenting a new and physical version of August Strindberg’s Miss Julie at the Theatre Local in the Bussey Building in Peckham, opening on the 31st of October 2012 and running until 17 November 2012. 
Our version of Miss Julie will be highly physical, a dance of lust and power between Julie and John, representing the almost tangible tensions at work over the length of the play. This all happens while on the grounds the local community is feasting and celebrating, barging onto stage at one point. This celebratory dance will be performed by members from Southwark’s local community.
The show will be directed by Vernon Douglas who has extensive experience in the theatre and having shown work at the Royal Court Theatre and The Young Vic among others.

A brutally funny modern tragedy, <strong><em>Electra in a One-Piece</em></strong> re-imagines the bloody Greek tale for our digital era.  When Elle discovers that her mother has murdered her father and is burying him in the backyard, she sends for help the only way she knows how: the internet.  Armed only with a video camera, she videotapes the gruesome scene and posts it on YouTube to alert her brother stationed in Iraq, inadvertently becoming an overnight YouTube sensation.  Urged on by the chatter of anonymous commenters clamoring for more, Elle and her family saturate the internet with videos, stirring controversy and piquing the interest of a savvy television producer with plans for a camera-ready bloodbath.<br/><br/><a href=""http://www.electrainaonepiece.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Visit The Show Website</a></p>

A brutally funny modern tragedy, Electra in a One-Piece re-imagines the bloody Greek tale for our digital era.  When Elle discovers that her mother has murdered her father and is burying him in the backyard, she sends for help the only way she knows how: the internet.  Armed only with a video camera, she videotapes the gruesome scene and posts it on YouTube to alert her brother stationed in Iraq, inadvertently becoming an overnight YouTube sensation.  Urged on by the chatter of anonymous commenters clamoring for more, Elle and her family saturate the internet with videos, stirring controversy and piquing the interest of a savvy television producer with plans for a camera-ready bloodbath.Visit The Show Website

<h2><strong>""No More Secrets"" : Using performing arts to encourage elementary school children to prevent and/or disclose sexual abuse.</strong></h2>
<p>Street Theatre Company is a non-profit, professional arts organization dedicated to fostering theatre, music and arts education in Nashville by producing the highest quality professional theatre performances and educational workshops, and providing artistic opportunities for young people.  Street Theatre Company bases its philosophy on the elements of street theatre: to make the arts accessible and affordable to all in the community, and select thought-provoking productions that can leave an audience enlightened.  </p>
<p>As part of its youth programming and community outreach, STC produces the social service play, <em>No More Secrets</em>.  1 out of 6 girls and 1 out of 8 boys will be sexually abused each year. Statistics show that over 89% of child sexual assault and abuse comes from someone a family knows, and only 16% of children who suffer from abuse disclose. More than ever, children need the opportunity to learn more about the prevention of sexual abuse.</p>
<p><em>No More Secrets</em> is a musical that tells the tale of a pre-teen girl named Jenny who, for years, has been sexually abused by a trusted neighbor, and her subsequent disclosure. The play entertains while at the same time providing children with information about abuse and how they can protect themselves and others from abuse. This show addresses many of the concerns children may have about disclosing and truly connects with students. All characters are portrayed by professional actors who have been trained by counselors. The play is followed by a question and answer period where the students are invited to ask questions, and a professional counselor and school guidance counselors are available to provide additional support in the event of disclosure.</p>
<p><em>No More Secrets</em> previously toured Nashville area disadvantaged schools, performing at 15 schools in 2009 and 10 schools in 2011, as well as offering two free public performances at a local community center.  The show has a proven track record of success with disclosures well into the double digits at the end of each tour.</p>
<p>The most powerful feedback came in an email from a counselor:</p>
<p><em>“I want you to know that we had 9 disclosures with 3 of them resulting in DCS calls. One resulted in the arrest of a family member that evening. Had you not visited our school, this student would have entered her summer break with the abuse likely happening on a daily basis. The student had been exposed to Safe At Last through my classroom guidance, Kids on the Block abuse program, and finally “No More Secrets”. She really related to the play and disclosed that afternoon. I can’t begin to tell you how grateful I am for your program and hope that many more of our students in Metro Schools will be able to benefit from the play. Well done!”</em></p>
<p>STC’s long term goal is to tour approximately 25 schools each year, and to continue on a rotating basis every three years to each given school, ensuring that all students see the program at least once.  If this goal is met, over 6,000 students can be reached each year. The goal for us on Indiegogo is to reach 7 schools in the fall of 2013 with enough funding so that schools will not have to pay for the program. The objective of this program is that students will leave the performance with tools to prevent sexual abuse from happening to them, or if they are already being abused, that they will disclose the abuse to a trusted adult.</p>
<p>The <em>No More Secrets</em> tour costs $675 to bring to each school.  As school budgets are perpetually diminishing, the goal is to offer this program at absolutely NO COST to schools to remove barriers that may prevent children from seeing this important social play, especially those in undeserved populations.  </p>

<p><b>Brussels, PARTS &amp; the Arts! <br/></b></p>
<ul>
<li>My name is Tiffany Martin- I am a student and an
     aspiring performing artist and choreographer/director. Currently I am
     majoring in Dance &amp; Theater at University of California Davis. I have
     been passionate about dance &amp; theater throughout my life and it is my
     deep desire to continue working in the arts world- to dance, create original
     productions, and teach. </li>
<li>I began dancing at a very young age. Growing up in
     the Sierra foothills, in Placerville, California there were very few
     opportunities to study dance. So, I became very involved in the theater
     world, and eventually began creating and mounting original dance/theatre
     productions involving many artists in the community. I produced three
     original, devised shows, all of which incorporated dancers and non-dancers.
     These shows received ample positive feedback from the community. They were
     all free to the public, and the money we did raise helped support the high
     school theater program. This is the type of work I would like to continue to create &amp; mount. <br/>
</li>
<li>I recently transferred to UC Davis to continue studying
     dance. I am a third-year undergraduate, and will be graduating next spring
     2015. </li>
<li>Dance is an integral part of my life; I wish to make a
     life and a living centered on the arts. Next summer 2015, I have the unique opportunity to
     continue my education abroad in Brussels, Belgium. I have been accepted
     into the summer program at the contemporary dance school P.A.R.T.S.,
     established by dance pioneer Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker. The summer
     session includes a variety of classes in Yoga, Contemporary dance
     technique, Movement improvisation, and choreography taught by renowned
     teachers. I strongly believe that this workshop will be a great post-graduation opportunity, a way to meet teachers &amp; make connections. Going abroad, to a place like Belgium, a hub of
     cutting-edge performance arts culture, would broaden my perspectives as an
     artist. I have no doubt that it will deepen my knowledge
     and help me to move forward with my own work. My experience at PARTS
     will ripple outward into the arts community, as it will help me continue
     to mount dance productions and teach dance in the local area.  More on PARTS here: <a href=""http://www.parts.be/en/summer-projects"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.parts.be/en/summer-projects</a>
</li>
<li>While in Europe, I hope to visit the surrounding
     countries France, the Netherlands, and Germany. There are many dance and
     theater events going on all summer in these areas, and I hope to involve
     myself in additional workshops, as well as see performances. If I can manage to raise enough funds, I will also attend classes &amp; workshops at ImPulsTanz in Vienna, Austria. ImPulsTanz is an amazing dance festival with classes &amp; performances galore.

</li>
</ul><p><b>Your Support <br/></b></p>
<ul>
<li>I am going to UC Davis on an academic/need-based
     scholarship. Because of the often unstable financial realities of working
     as an artist, I chose not to take out any student loans. So, I am a
     full-time student and I also work several jobs to cover the costs of
     living. In this way, I have no extra funds for educational trips. So, in order
     to make this trip to Brussels happen, I am in need of financial support. </li>
<li>$3,000 will cover the costs of tuition, a plane ticket,
     housing, and necessities. </li>
<li>There are awesome, artsy, handmade, &amp; heartfelt
     thank-you gifts for all donations, from $10 to $500+. Please check out the

     artist in the greater spectrum of the community and the world, and am
     always giving back with my work. </li>

While in Europe, I hope to visit the surrounding
     countries France, the Netherlands, and Germany. There are many dance and
     theater events going on all summer in these areas, and I hope to involve
     myself in additional workshops, as well as see performances. If I can manage to raise enough funds, I will also attend classes & workshops at ImPulsTanz in Vienna, Austria. ImPulsTanz is an amazing dance festival with classes & performances galore. More on ImPulsTanz: http://www.impulstanz.com/en/

All this depends a great deal on your support...

Your Support 

I am going to UC Davis on an academic/need-based
     scholarship. Because of the often unstable financial realities of working
     as an artist, I chose not to take out any student loans. So, I am a
     full-time student and I also work several jobs to cover the costs of
     living. In this way, I have no extra funds for educational trips. So, in order
     to make this trip to Brussels happen, I am in need of financial support. 
$3,000 will cover the costs of tuition, a plane ticket,
     housing, and necessities. 
There are awesome, artsy, handmade, & heartfelt
     thank-you gifts for all donations, from $10 to $500+. Please check out the
     perks and see what gifts you can receive for your support.
The
Impact

This experience will help me grow as an individual, an
     student, an artist, and a future teacher of the arts. Your support here
     will go back into the world ten-fold, guaranteed. I see my work as an
     artist in the greater spectrum of the community and the world, and am
     always giving back with my work. 
I have created Kickstarter campaigns for my last two
     dance/theater productions, both of which were funded & completed
     successfully, and all promises met.

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>For the past 3 years, I've written and directed original musicals at Saint Rose. I can honestly say that it has been the best experience of my life. This is my last year doing this, and I could really use some help! Roger That: The Sleuthsical is a murder mystery musical that takes place at a circus. I have a lot of faith in this show, and there's so much that I would love to do with it. However, I don't get paid to do this, and I don't get a budget, so any money that goes into the show comes out of my pocket. Any amount that you could contribute would be extremely helpful and appreciated. The show will be March 30 &amp; 31 in St. Joe's Auditorium</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>While writing and directing a show is difficult on top of being a full-time student, I've come across a lot of obstacles that could be fixed. The school can only provide 3 handheld microphones for us to use that aren't even designed for us to sing with. Having to hold the microphone, and pass it off to other actors on stage during a scene is distracting and frustrating. Having to block the scenes around this is annoying, and really limits all the things that I could do. Additionally, the backstage area of the auditorium is very limited. There is essentially no where for the actors to go when they're not in a scene, so having to fit props and scenery back there is also really difficult. I would love to be able to build a set that not only sets up the scene that is happening, but also extends the back stage area so that we can easily move around to ensure that nobody gets hurt moving around backstage in the dark. </p>

<p>'Dreamplace &amp; The Black Box Memoir' is a new one act play - a mix of poetry and monologue written and performed by Barbara Lorraine Laing. The play was developed as part of the In(ter)ventions: Literary Practice at the Edge program at The Banff Centre in February 2012. It follows the story of Theresa, a 31 year old woman who finds herself at the bottom of the ocean floor. We listen into her underwater conversations with an old friend as she explores her own 'black box' - the parts of herself she thought were indestructible - and discover that memory, like sound, is often distorted in our 'dreamplaces'.</p>
<p>Currently, I am slotted to perform at The Toronto Fringe Festival's Artist Alley in July 2012. This includes 8 performance slots in a 'tent' space. The play has also been submitted to the SummerWorks Theatre Festival - and the final decision will be made on April 1st. In addition, I am in the process of securing a third summer venue in the GTA. Having returned to Canada in November after four years teaching in an English seaside town in the UK, I am currently looking to secure sponsorship, grants and other funding to assist me in establishing my company and producing new theatrical/poetic work in the Toronto area and beyond. Specifically, the new piece I created received a very positive response from faculty and peers at the In(ter)ventions program last month, and I have secured a place for it at The Toronto Fringe Festival as part of the AlleyPlays, July 4-15th.</p>
<p>I will be presenting the play at 2 other venues this summer, including a potential slot at the SummerWorks festival <a href=""http://www.summerworks.ca/2011/home.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.summerworks.ca/2011/home.php</a>. If accepted into the SummerWorks festival, I will need to pay $791 in the first week of April. Below you will find a list of the primary expenses that need to be covered. By earning a minimum $1000, I will be able to cover the cost of the SummerWorks festival fee (if the play is accepted), and/or use the funds towards meeting the following needs at the Fringe and other venues:</p>
<p>- Publicity/Advertising</p>
<p>- Workshop and rehearsal space </p>
<p>- Venue/Festival Entrance Fees</p>
<p>- Set construction &amp; Props</p>
<p>- Honorarium for hiring a director and technical crew</p>
<p>- Transportation</p>
<p>- Hiring a musician</p>
<p>Please note that because I have been living out of province for the last four years, I do not qualify for Ontario Arts Council funding at this time.</p>

<p><strong>Company Info</strong></p>
<p>‘She’s Making a Spectacle of Herself!’ is a new theatre company which specializes in poetry, performance, interdisciplinary projects and creative workshops. We develop and support new writing and artistic work that is experimental, poetic, and engaging. Striving to create beautiful and thought provoking performances, our events and workshops aim to be playful, adaptable, all-around-sassy occasions which highlight the work of local writers, musicians and artists who support and honour creative adventures. We hope to encourage and foster a spirit of connection and collaboration between artists, educators and the community.</p>
<p><strong>Why a Spectacle?</strong></p>
<p>The 'actress' and women who 'perform' have always been daring. Throughout the history of theatre and literature, there has been a tendency to label women who have the power to make people laugh as 'bizarre', 'unfeminine' or as 'making spectacles of themselves'. During her graduate studies Barbara became fascinated by stories of these women who risked being 'too much' and began to see parallels in the accounts of travel writers, poets and other artists. In the context of the company’s current mandate and goals, the slightly tongue-in-cheek ‘spectacle’ reference in the title can, nowadays, be applied to anyone who dares to create something, to challenge expectations, and the sense empowerment and adventure generated by artistic exploration.</p></div>","Project Overview

</p><p>Embodiment Project is a bay area-based street dance theater company dedicated to presenting arts
as moral action to audiences of diverse demographics.   Our new
work <i>Chalk Outlines</i>, interweaves

Brown, Trayvon Martin, Oscar Grant, Freddie Gray, Eric Garner and the countless
other African American men who have unjustly lost their lives due to police
brutality.  This production includes all original music by Valerie Troutt

off the first night of Rennie Harris’ 18th Annual Illadleph Legends of
Hip Hop Festival Bay Area, which will include workshops, panel discussions
and performances with pioneers of hip hop dance from around the country.</p>

As you can see, the cost of the show is more than the $2,000 we set as our goal. That’s our minimal goal. Really, we need to raise $3,000.
And the rest?
We’ve received a grant from the Cambridge Arts Council and Mass Cultural Council, and we’ve raised the rest from generous donors who have gotten us most of the way. Now we need YOU to get over the finish line.
 
Liars & Believers is a 501(c)(3) non-profit, so all of your donation, above your ticket ($20/$30) and Soundtrack download ($25) is tax deductible!

FOR THE FINAL 5 DAYS OF OUR CAMPAIGN, ALL CONTRIBUTIONS WILL BE MATCHED, UP TO $3000. THAT'S RIGHT. FOR EVERY $1 YOU GIVE, YOU EFFECTIVELY GIVE $2! 



“Sensitively directed by Travis Chamberlain and shrewdly acted by Erin Markey, Tennessee Williams' GREEN EYES is gorgeous: a short, eloquent evening that feels complete, complex, and entirely satisfying. I'd like to think [this production] sounds a clarion call for more first-rate productions of Williams' much demeaned later work.”

                –John Lahr, The New Yorker

OUR STORY
Straight from its sold-out premiere run in New York City, Travis Chamberlain’s highly acclaimed site-specific production of Tennessee Williams' GREEN EYES debuts in downtown Boston at The Ames Hotel, presented by Company One ---- January 18-Febraury 15, 2012. 


This no-holds-barred production stuns with a searing lead performance by Erin Markey—“a kittenish vixen whose sexual pliancy hides an iron will” (The New York Times)—duking it out with her husband on their honeymoon in New Orleans.  In the course of an evening, GREEN EYES transforms an actual hotel suite into a psychosexual battleground, where desire and violence become indistinguishable. Produced by Chris Keegan and The Kindness.

THE IMPACT
Presented by Company One, ""one of the 10 most inspiring and innovative theatre  companies on our national landscape”  according to The American Theater Wing (Tony Awards), the Boston premiere of GREEN EYES is going to prove, yet again, why this production remains one of the most talked-about debuts of Williams’ work in recent years.Penned in 1970 and then hidden away for decades, GREEN EYES was only just published in 2008, twenty-five years after Williams’ death. Your support allows to us bring this “lost” romantic thriller to a broader public, illuminating the provocative relevance of Williams’ rarely produced late experimental plays for contemporary audiences.ALSO: This year marks Williams’ centennial. And with your help, we'd like to give him the best birthday present a playwright (dead or alive) could wish for--A PREMIERE!!

WHAT WE NEED & WHAT YOU GET
We've got the gig. We've got our team. We've got a great show. These things are certain.


But we still need your help. Our goal for this campaign is $3000.

Your donations will get us there (via Amtrak) and put a roof over our heads (for a month) during the month that we will be working in Boston. Donations will also contribute to rehearsal expenses, administrative overhead, and, perhaps most importantly, our day-to-day quality of life as artists who too often overextend, cut corners, and grossly underpay ourselves (when we're lucky) in order to take advantage of opportunities (like this) to share our work with new audiences.
$3000 only covers a fraction of the money we need to raise for this production (based on what we feel comfortable asking for through IndieGoGo), so if we make our goal, please do not let that deter you from continuing to give. We promise to put your money to good use!TAX DEDUCTIBLE

<h1>A New Home for Actors, Artists, and Audience</h1>
<p>In Syracuse there are a host of small community theater companies, but no dedicated space devoted to community theater and performance programming.  Many of the civic and private theaters in Syracuse have priced themselves out of affordability for most small or even large community theaters.  Enter our project, The Central New York Playhouse:</p>

<div class=""template asset""> </div>
<h1>A Unique Space with a Unique Mission</h1>
<p>We are building a new home for Actors, Artists, and Audience.  The space we have chosen is a former retail space in Shoppingtown Mall.  Our 4500 complex will have 800 square feet of performance space, a full rehearsal room, a music room, a secondary cabaret area, and of course our audience area able to seat almost 200 people.</p>

<div class=""template asset""> </div>
<h1>The Construction Fund Goals</h1>
<p>But before we open we need your help.  Proper construction of our stage is expensive.  The stage needs to be made of fire treated wood &amp; the curtains have to be fire retardant.  That is to say nothing about tables, chairs, re-designing the entryway into the theater and curtaining a long line of windows on one side of the theater.  That is why we are hoping that you will help kick start our project and help us fund it fully and beyond.</p>

<h1>Opportunities for Hundreds of Local Actors and Artists, and Potentially Several Thousand Audience Members</h1>
<p>Once we build our stage we have a very intense main stage schedule.  Over the next 13 months we will bring 10 fully staged theatrical productions.  Our productions range from farcical comedies, to poignant classics, and 3 full scale musicals.  Four of our offerings will be Central New York premieres including the CNY amateur premiere of Monty Python's Spamalot taking the stage in the first weekend it will be available to community theaters in North America.</p>

Every line is a piece of poetry. That is the first thing that drew me to this play: the beauty that seeps out of it, which I found so affective upon first reading. This beauty is steeped in spirituality, and engaging with this spirituality has been a transforming experience for everybody working on the play. Lines like: ""Benjamin, open the curtains - I want God to see us"" are mystical and metaphysical, and the cast and I have worked hard to bring these lines to life.

It is filled with beautiful language and characters who are caught up in spiritual agony and ecstasy: sometimes both at once. Directed by <strong>William Rasitsan-Powell</strong>, the show will open Friday April 25th, 2014 and run until Saturday May 3rd, 2014 at <strong>The Box Toronto</strong>, a new and exciting space in Toronto.</p><p><em>Easter</em> features an energetic and risk-taking cast, starring <strong>Mathieu Burdan</strong>, <strong>Stephanie Seaton</strong>, <strong>Eva Barrie</strong>, <strong>Addison Becker, Jamie Johnson</strong> and <strong>Margaret Hild.</strong></p><p><strong>Easter</strong> is the second production by <strong>Naught, A Theatre Company</strong>, which is committed to producing spiritual and metaphysical pieces that seek to breathe new life into the theatre. The company was founded in 2013 by husband and wife duo <strong>William and Beata Rasitsan-Powell</strong>. Their first production was William's play <em><strong>Something Is Wrong</strong></em>, in the summer of 2013. Easter is a chance for the company to develop its mandate and to broaden it to include existing works that inspire the moving, spiritual experience that the company wants to bring to audiences.</p><p><u>Show information for <em><strong>Easter</strong></em>:</u></p><p>Venue: The Box Toronto, 89 Niagara St.</p><p>Opens: April 25, 2014</p><p>Closes: May 3, 2014</p><p>Performances: April 25-26; May 1-3, 8PM</p><p>Tickets: $18; Student $12</p><p>Tickets are available at <a href=""http://naughttheatre.wordpress.com/buytickets/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://naughttheatre.wordpress.com/buytickets/</a>, in person, or at the door.

Of course, we are trying to cut costs wherever we can: by borrowing from other companies, rehearsing at the cheapest spaces in town, not advertising on video billboards on the Gardiner, etc. Most importantly, we want to put up a show that lives up to our artistic vision and standards. Easter is an absolutely beautiful play. Every line is a piece of poetry. That is the first thing that drew me to this play: the beauty that seeps out of it, which I found so affective upon first reading. This beauty is steeped in spirituality, and engaging with this spirituality has been a transforming experience for everybody working on the play. Lines like: ""Benjamin, open the curtains - I want God to see us"" are mystical and metaphysical, and the cast and I have worked hard to bring these lines to life. Strindberg's characters are at once archetypal and visceral, forcing each other towards grace, pulling out the rug of hypocrisy, so that the prideful can learn what it means to fall.Please, help out in any way you can. Every $5 makes a tremendous difference towards how successful and effective this show can be. We appreciate your support!Sincerely,William Rasitsan-PowellArtistic DirectorNaught, A Theatre CompanyHere's some information about the production of Easter:Spring is coming. The ice is finally melting in the streets and in our hearts. The Heyst family has been consumed with pride and shame, but these will be torn from them, no matter how hard they cling. Naught, A Theatre Company, presents Easter, a lesser-known work by the brilliant turn-of-the-century Swedish playwright August Strindberg. Easter is the story of the changing of the seasons, of moving towards the light, of learning to embrace change. It is filled with beautiful language and characters who are caught up in spiritual agony and ecstasy: sometimes both at once. Directed by William Rasitsan-Powell, the show will open Friday April 25th, 2014 and run until Saturday May 3rd, 2014 at The Box Toronto, a new and exciting space in Toronto.Easter features an energetic and risk-taking cast, starring Mathieu Burdan, Stephanie Seaton, Eva Barrie, Addison Becker, Jamie Johnson and Margaret Hild.Easter is the second production by Naught, A Theatre Company, which is committed to producing spiritual and metaphysical pieces that seek to breathe new life into the theatre. The company was founded in 2013 by husband and wife duo William and Beata Rasitsan-Powell. Their first production was William's play Something Is Wrong, in the summer of 2013. Easter is a chance for the company to develop its mandate and to broaden it to include existing works that inspire the moving, spiritual experience that the company wants to bring to audiences.Show information for Easter:Venue: The Box Toronto, 89 Niagara St.Opens: April 25, 2014Closes: May 3, 2014Performances: April 25-26; May 1-3, 8PMTickets: $18; Student $12Tickets are available at http://naughttheatre.wordpress.com/buytickets/, in person, or at the door.

Thank you!About the Project Verge follows four dancers as they move between the realms of ancient forest and clearcut, embodying both the ecological connections that support life in British Columbia’s ancient temperate rainforests and the fragmentation of this landscape through industrial logging.This film invites the viewer to stand, as witness and potential activist, at the epicenter of this scarred and sacred landscape.Born out of a collaboration between Vancouver-based choreographer Anna Kraulis, media artist Leslie Kennah, and Ancient Forest Alliance activist Hannah Carpendale, Verge aims to bridge the arts and conservation movements, combining artistic expression and forest activism to create a compelling, site-specific dance film. 
Where It Came From  In the summer of 2013, we shot an exploratory pilot film (above) on Coast Salish Territory in Stanley Park (Vancouver) with dancers Jennifer Aoki, Jennifer Dunford, Angelina Krahn and Rianne Svelnis.

Impact This project does not exist in isolation - rather, it is part of a growing movement towards a deeper and more personal connection with environmental issues. By merging artistic practice with the forest conservation movement, we can draw greater attention from a more diverse audience. This artistic activism encourages people to engage with the issue in a deeper, more meaningful way.

About the Creators This is the second collaborative project between Leslie Kennah, Hannah Carpendale and Anna Kraulis. We began working together after recognizing the potential impact that merging our diverse areas of expertise could have. In 2013, we collaborated on the project Water Bodies, combining dance and film to raise awareness about the cultural/historical and ecological significance of water, specifically exploring the lost and buried streams of the Vancouver’s False Creek Watershed.Our group has been generously awarded a DanceLab research residency (2013/14) at The Dance Centre in Vancouver. Individually, we are all recognized professionals in our respective disciplines and we continue to grow a significant body of work in the arts and activism fields. The dancers we have chosen for this project are professional artists who each bring to the work a strong connection to environmental activism. We are lucky to have such a dedicated team!

<h3>     The opportunity has arrisen for me to perform this New Orleans style dance at a collaborative concert in New York City as part of a cultural exchange campaign.  The concert, Too Hot For New Orleans, will be funded and organized by James Demaria Productions, and is a collaboration between New York hip hop artists and New Orleans musicians.  The aim is to create a new musical genre to be sponsored, brought and shared ultimately around the world, while shedding light on the importance of the two cultures.  Mr. Demaria has filmed a documentary called Treme Life and done extensive professional photography within and for the city of New Orleans.  As a cultural enthusiast, he sees my dance as a crucial element to the making and marketing of this musical genre.  It will help to engage the listeners, define the feel of the new music, and shed light on the influential culture of New Orleans and its effects on surrounding cultures.  </h3>
<h3>     Your contributions will help to cover travel, housing, and compensation for the time and energy put into the performance. You will also receive gifts in return for your donations.  On a larger scale, allowing me to participate in this cultural exchange will help to put New Orleans culture on the global map.  While the collaboration of hip hop and New Orleans funk contributes to the progression of artistic expression and cultural unity in a big way, the preservation and development of dance only strengthens that goal.  </h3>
<h3>     To me, this concert won't be complete without dance.  Giving the audience permission to move, showing them <em>how</em> they can move to the new music, revving their enthusiasm, and essentially conversing with &amp; playing off the musicians to strengthen the entire art, must happen for this collaboration to gain sponsorship and grow larger.  </h3>

<p><span class=""font_8""><span class=""font_9"">Cabaret Roulette </span></span><span class=""font_8""><span class=""font_9"">launched in November 2012 with a simple goal: to shake up the cabaret scene by throwing out old ideas, empowering audiences and challenging artists to push beyond their comfort zones. We've had two shows so far and a third is in the hopper, and the quality has been OUTSTANDING.<br/></span></span></p>
<p><span class=""font_8""><span class=""font_9"">Each show has a central theme, </span></span><span class=""font_8""><span class=""font_9"">chosen in advance by the audience </span></span><span class=""font_8""><span class=""font_9"">via the <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/CabaretRoulette"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Facebook fan page</a>, followed by a live vote. Eight carefully-curated artists,</span></span><span class=""font_8""><span class=""font_9""> representing as widely-differing disciplines and styles as possible, then have two months to create a brand new act putting their individual take on that single theme. The show is called ""Roulette"" because we won't know where the ball lands until the night.</span></span></p>
<p><span class=""font_8""><span class=""font_9"">The model encourages creativity and risk: with just a hint of friendly competition, the artists are inspired to dig past the obvious and the done to create something truly fresh and extraordinary. And with no discipline duplicated on the night, the audience can expect an exciting, fascinating evening of true variety.</span></span></p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Out of necessity, we ran the first shows as a doorshare, splitting the remaining profits evenly between the artists - a method that thankfully has worked well but is no model for ensuring the quality of the art we're asking for and encouraging the long life of the show.</p>
<p>We are fundraising in order to establish a small fund from which to guarantee artist fees and reduce personal risk.  If the show does well, the ticket sales will comfortably replenish the fund and we can roll it over for use on the next show. If the show doesn't do well, the artists still get paid for their hard work and we assess the future of the show based on its commercial appeal and prospects.</p>
<p>Some of our dreams for the show include:</p>
<p>* Moving to a better night for the audience.  Right now all we can afford are Wednesdays, but this a Friday kind of show!</p>
<p>* Move to a monthly format, with two shows in the hopper at any given time, in order to capitalise on the momentum.</p>
<p>* Build on the theatre experience side of the experience, further differentiating ourselves from the crowd of burlesque shows out there.</p>
<p>* Longer runs!  Perhaps a tour!  Why not London's WEST END!?!</p>
</div>
<div>And if the show continues to do well right to the point where we decide to move on to other projects, we commit to rolling our parachute money over to another arts company in need. It's only right.</div>

<p>""I Was Loved by a Rat"" is a twisted fairy tale, a dark comedy, and a humorous tragedy revolving around an ill-fated love between a lonely young woman and a chivalrous rat who share a squalid apartment. While the world of the play is surreal and whimsical, at its heart the story explores the tensions between the love and fear, desire and revulsion that underlie many of our closest (human) relationships.</p>
<p>This play was written by Essie Martsinkovsky while she was pursuing her M.F.A. at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, Asia, in Singapore. After a number of class workshops and a public reading with a Singaporean arts organization, she submitted the play to FringeNYC and was thrilled to learn she'd have a chance to create a fully staged version for an audience.</p>
<h2>What We Need :</h2>
<p>Putting on a show at FringeNYC does cost money. Here are just a few of the things that we need money to pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rehearsal space and studio Fees</li>
<li>Props, costumes and set pieces</li>
<li>Insurance to cover us, and insurance to cover you when you come to see the show!</li>
<li>A stage manager, a lighting programmer, and a venue manager</li>
<li>Stipends for our actors</li>
<li>Programs and postcards to promote the show</li>
<li>Fireproofing our set</li>
</ul><p>We need $3475 to safely cover all the costs of our production. We know this is a big number and <strong><em>n</em></strong><em><strong>o donation is too small, even a dollar helps!</strong></em> And, if you break it down, we only need at least 139 of you to donate $25 each and we'll reach our goal in no time!</p>
<h2>What You'll Get :</h2>
<p>Other than the wonderful warm fuzzies of doing something good for your fellow man, and a fully realized version of ""I Was Loved By a Rat"" - we have lots of great swag and prizes for all of our donors big and small! Please check out the prizes at the side of the page for more details!</p>
<h2>The Team :</h2>
<p>Audra Arnaudon (<em>Producer/Authorized Company Representative) </em><span class=""notranslate"">majored in Film and Television and minored in Producing at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. A Brooklyn resident, she currently works in Production Management for National Geographic Television. In 2012, Audra produced ""...And Then She DIES at the End!"" for FringeNYC. It received a Performance award, and turned a very small profit (Yay!). Because of her successful past experience with FringeNYC, she knows she can help make IWLBAR the best it can be!<br/></span></p>
<p><span class=""notranslate"">Essie Martsinkovsky <em>(Writer/Producer) </em>recently completed her M.F.A. in Dramatic Writing at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, Asia. While at Tisch, she acted in a variety of student films and plays, and directed a full production of her bilingual Russian/English short play ""About Face."" Prior to obtaining her M.F.A., she worked as an ESL teacher, a writing tutor, and mediator in small claims court, where she came across many people entangled in conflicts with their neighbors, roommates, and lovers.<br/></span></p>
<p>Anna Strasser <em>(Director)</em> is thrilled to be working on this project with Essie and Audra! She currently works as the Executive Assistant at Signature Theatre Company.

<h2>FringeNYC &amp; The Future :</h2>
<p>FringeNYC has served as a springboard to Broadway and Off-Broadway for many years, introducing the world to shows like ""Urinetown"" and ""Dog Sees God"". The festival has launched the careers of many well-known writers, such as The Office's Mindy Kaling. Basically: if you kill it at FringeNYC it can open doors. Doors you will have helped us walk through! We hope you'll support our show and the tradition of FringeNYC!</p>
<h2>Other Ways You Can Help :</h2>
<p><strong>If you're in Manhattan or close by - come see our show in August at FringeNYC!</strong> The proceeds we make for the show will help us to cover some of the costs we incurred while putting on the production. We're still waiting on our venue assignment and our performance schedule, but will be posting updates here as soon as we have them!</p>
<p><br/>If you can't come see the show, and you can't contribute, but you would still like to help out - <strong>make some noise for us!</strong> Use the links above (below the video) to let your friends know about our fundraising efforts!</p></div>","About The Show :
""I Was Loved by a Rat"" is a twisted fairy tale, a dark comedy, and a humorous tragedy revolving around an ill-fated love between a lonely young woman and a chivalrous rat who share a squalid apartment. While the world of the play is surreal and whimsical, at its heart the story explores the tensions between the love and fear, desire and revulsion that underlie many of our closest (human) relationships.
This play was written by Essie Martsinkovsky while she was pursuing her M.F.A. at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, Asia, in Singapore. After a number of class workshops and a public reading with a Singaporean arts organization, she submitted the play to FringeNYC and was thrilled to learn she'd have a chance to create a fully staged version for an audience.
What We Need :
Putting on a show at FringeNYC does cost money. Here are just a few of the things that we need money to pay for:

Rehearsal space and studio Fees
Props, costumes and set pieces
Insurance to cover us, and insurance to cover you when you come to see the show!
A stage manager, a lighting programmer, and a venue manager
Stipends for our actors
Programs and postcards to promote the show
Fireproofing our set
We need $3475 to safely cover all the costs of our production. We know this is a big number and no donation is too small, even a dollar helps! And, if you break it down, we only need at least 139 of you to donate $25 each and we'll reach our goal in no time!
What You'll Get :
Other than the wonderful warm fuzzies of doing something good for your fellow man, and a fully realized version of ""I Was Loved By a Rat"" - we have lots of great swag and prizes for all of our donors big and small! Please check out the prizes at the side of the page for more details!
The Team :
Audra Arnaudon (Producer/Authorized Company Representative) majored in Film and Television and minored in Producing at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. A Brooklyn resident, she currently works in Production Management for National Geographic Television. In 2012, Audra produced ""...And Then She DIES at the End!"" for FringeNYC. It received a Performance award, and turned a very small profit (Yay!). Because of her successful past experience with FringeNYC, she knows she can help make IWLBAR the best it can be!
Essie Martsinkovsky (Writer/Producer) recently completed her M.F.A. in Dramatic Writing at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, Asia. While at Tisch, she acted in a variety of student films and plays, and directed a full production of her bilingual Russian/English short play ""About Face."" Prior to obtaining her M.F.A., she worked as an ESL teacher, a writing tutor, and mediator in small claims court, where she came across many people entangled in conflicts with their neighbors, roommates, and lovers.
Anna Strasser (Director) is thrilled to be working on this project with Essie and Audra! She currently works as the Executive Assistant at Signature Theatre Company. Prior to that she worked in the administrative offices of Lincoln Center Theater. She recently directed a one act play by Anthony Dvarskas that premiered at the Strawberry One Act Festival. She also directed Lucy Wang in ""Chinese Girls Don't Swear"" at the Workshop Theater in Manhattan and helped her develop it into a one-woman show which was produced by the Emerging Artists Theater. Additionally she is producing ""Recipe For Success With Chef Michael Denardi"" which can also be seen at this year's New York International Fringe Festival.
