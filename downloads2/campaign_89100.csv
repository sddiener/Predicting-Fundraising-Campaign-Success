<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Engineering and production of electronic innovations bring their share of risks and challenges but the industry has developed well known solutions and remedies for them.

<p>We have already done initial validation of the Klipfone concept, and design, through the exact sized models we assembled with the 3D printed housing parts.

<h3>COMMON QUESTIONS ABOUT THE KLIPFONE CONCEPT</h3>
<p><strong>HOW IS KLIPFONE DIFFERENT FROM A TRADITIONAL WIRELESS HEADSET?</strong></p>
<p>A traditional wireless headset often gets lost, forcing some users to wear it all day long. As a result, the user experience of enjoying content on the smartphone is compromised by not turning on the sound or playing the sound, and annoying other people. By clipping directly to your phone, Klipfone becomes an always-available Bluetooth headset that allows the user to stop compromising on her content experience.</p>
<p><strong>DO I REALLY NEED KLIPFONE IN ADDITION TO MY STEREO HEADPHONE?</strong></p>
<p>We have found that there’s certainly room for both in our lives! The Klipfone headset complements conventional headphones, which are ideal for prolonged use such as listening to music or watching long videos. Klipfone is great for impromptu use such as watching video clips, video calls, or having to look up information on the phone screen during a call.</p>
<p><strong>DO I NEED KLIPFONE EVEN IF I WEAR A HEADPHONE OR A HEADSET ALL DAY?</strong></p>
<p>If you are such a user, you can still take a break from your headset or the headphone without having the fear of not finding them when you need them on a moment’s notice. This is so because you can always depend on the Klipfone headset being handy right on your smartphone.</p>
<p><strong>FOR IMPROMPTU NEED, WHY CAN’T I USE THE SPEAKERPHONE? </strong></p>
<p>Unless you are alone, the sound from a speakerphone will annoy those around you. Also, sound from the speakerphone can be hard to hear if you are in a noisy public place. In such conditions, the Klipfone headset provides a simple elegant solution.</p>
<p><strong>WILL KLIPFONE SUPPORT MY PHONE AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL DEVICES?</strong></p>
<p>The Klipfone headset will pair with up to two devices simultaneously - a phone, and a tablet or a laptop that support wireless capability. Once paired with your phone and one additional device, the Klipfone headset will play the audio from either device seamlessly, one at a time.</p>
<p><strong>ARE THERE DIFFERENT SIZES OF EARBUDS TO FIT DIFFERENT EARS?</strong></p>
<p>With the Klipfone headset, one size actually does fit all. Its unique shape allows it to securely clip into your ear without trying to squeeze an ear-bud into your ear canal as done by conventional headsets.</p>
<p><strong>ARE THERE PLANS FOR FOLLOW ON FUTURE PRODUCTS</strong></p>
<p>We plan to develop and bring to market various Klipfone headset versions that will fit a wide variety of devices. In addition, we are planning several add-on modules and cases to complement the Klipfone headset. These peripherals will provide added battery power, charging, and protection for the Klipfone headset and the phone itself. </p>
<p><u>We are planning an upgrade path for Klipfone backers to future models and accessories.</u></p>

Unless you are alone, the sound from a speakerphone will annoy those around you. Also, sound from the speakerphone can be hard to hear if you are in a noisy public place. In such conditions, the Klipfone headset provides a simple elegant solution.
WILL KLIPFONE SUPPORT MY PHONE AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL DEVICES?
The Klipfone headset will pair with up to two devices simultaneously - a phone, and a tablet or a laptop that support wireless capability. Once paired with your phone and one additional device, the Klipfone headset will play the audio from either device seamlessly, one at a time.
ARE THERE DIFFERENT SIZES OF EARBUDS TO FIT DIFFERENT EARS?
With the Klipfone headset, one size actually does fit all. Its unique shape allows it to securely clip into your ear without trying to squeeze an ear-bud into your ear canal as done by conventional headsets.
ARE THERE PLANS FOR FOLLOW ON FUTURE PRODUCTS
We plan to develop and bring to market various Klipfone headset versions that will fit a wide variety of devices. In addition, we are planning several add-on modules and cases to complement the Klipfone headset. These peripherals will provide added battery power, charging, and protection for the Klipfone headset and the phone itself. 
We are planning an upgrade path for Klipfone backers to future models and accessories.

THE AVERT USB SAFETY ADAPTOR, WILL PROTECT YOU, YOUR FAMILY & FRIENDS 

What is the Problem?
USB Charger's have no built-in electrical protection which means that if an electrical fault occurs, in or downstream of the charging unit, the electricity can not be isolated or cut-off.
Many homes and commercial buildings have Safety devices (RCD's Residual Current Devices & GFCI's Ground Fault Current Interrupters) installed in the switchboard, however they do not provide protection against DC (Direct Current) ELV (Extra Low Voltage) electrical faults, which can occur with USB charged products.
Why Are USB Chargers Dangerous?
The voltage these USB chargers produce (typically 3 Volts to 9 Volts DC) is not the issue, the up to 3 Amps of current they produce, is the safety problem and can do serious damage with an unfortunate circumstance.
Fibrillation of the heart occurs at 50 to 100milli-amps and 3 amps is 30 times greater than 100milli-amps.  Fire can also start from as low 100milli-amps.
                
The Avert USB Safety Adaptor 
The Avert USB Safety Adaptor, incorporates a unique ‘Blu-Chip’ technology, that detects and cuts-off the power when an electrical fault is detected, at DC ELV levels, when charging or using electronic devices, safe-guarding the lives of individuals when needed most.We all use USB Rechargeable Products Everyday - yet none of them has 'Built-in Electrical Protection' to guard against an electrical fault condition, product misuse or electrical safety complacency.Just like surge control devices, which are commonly used to protect computers and electronic goods from voltage surges, the Avert USB Safety Adapter protects you and your family from a potentially dangerous electrical fault conditions.                                      
Why are manufacturers of USB chargers & products               not providing electrical protection?
Manufacturers of electronic products are using USB Charger-Adaptors to recharge their products, but these USB Chargers are not as SAFE as they should be... Electrically. 
There is a perception that there is no danger when using USB chargeable products because of the ELV and Double Insulation, however there can be up to 3 amps of current & no electrical protection on these low voltage DC chargers.                          Global Product Safety Recalls Recently, even trusted manufacturers such as Apple and Microsoft have been forced to carry out major recalls of some of their charging products due to some users receiving electrical shocks or resultant fires. There are also large numbers of other manufacturers that have had products banned or recalled over the last few years, due to serious electrical safety incidents or fires.

Many Documented Cases 

There are many documented cases of injuries or
electrocutions caused by USB chargers, highlighting these SAFETY concerns.
These range from phones being accidently dropped into water while charging, to
infants sucking on an electrically connected USB cord.

<p>Before coming to Indiegogo we wanted to ensure that our display could be a reality. We started over 9 months ago developing this display. At current stage, we are still trying to make it better, but even we fail to make it on time, you still could get a working one as you see in the video or pictures if you want to get the whole product earlier. And such modification would not influence the cost. There are still some minor parts such as the tripod or other accessories not shown in the perk list, but it would be easier to make it on time.</p>
<p>We are confident our 4 month production timeline is achievable. Since in the major parts, like LCD or casing, there is no design out of manufacturing ability. What we need to do is to keep everything on schedule. And we would update you here and twitter to keep everyone informed. </p>

<p><b>5. Do you have a warranty?</b></p>
<p>No, at current stage we do not have such

<p><b>7. Why touch panel is not a standard part?</b></p>
<p>First, the cost of touch panel with good
performance on big size LCD is a little high. Second, according to our
understanding, such touch function, especially multi touch could not work well
on Raspberry yet because of the driver issue. So we decide not to make it as a
standard part. Keyboard and mouse should be enough to work with this display.
However you still could choose the set including touch panel if you are

utilizing the world's largest open-sourced IoT framework, AllSeen Alliance’s AllJoyn.Existing smart home packages are focused on home security or
home energy savings. However, there are numerous parts to install and difficult
to setup. This is why a lot of people are reluctant to start using IoT products
for the home. MagicHome’s starter package is an easy to use smart home solution
that utilizes IoT in an efficient manner. 
Most smart bulbs use a standard E26 base. If you have a lamp that
supports this type, just plug it in and connect it to your wi-fi network. Our smart
plug can be plugged into any existing outlet and connected to your home
appliances. 
Simply plug in our MagicCast device into your TV's or monitor's HDMI
port to enjoy instant smart home solutions as well as other
various media services. 

Smart plugs and light bulbs can easily be controlled by connecting
them to your home’s wi-fi network and controlled via either our UI through your TV or our app. 

Plug in any of your home appliances or devices into our MagicHome Smart Power Plug to obtain instant control through the MagicHome app. MagicHome also utilizes multiple media services that will help
create scenarios that users want and control other smart tools. 


Through the MagicCast HDMI stick, you can control your smart plugs and bulbs using the provided UI through your TV/monitor as well as the app that we have developed. The MagicCast device is the core of our package and is extremely smart and customizable. 


You can enjoy a smarter lifestyle with various media
services and convenience features.Customize your home settings when watching a movie or playing a game. Once setup, it'll activate automatically.You can see the amount of
electricity you’re using in real-time and also the rates so you can plan the
amount you wish to use and help save energy.Information is delivered effectively through our user
interface to your TV or monitor.



If you don’t
like coming into a dark home, turn on the lights before coming in. If you’re
worried about theft while on vacation, you can control your bulbs and other
devices like your TV or stereo to dissuade robbers. Customize your own scenarios and control your home from wherever, whenever. 
Media/Game Mode: Select Game mode to enjoy various
effects while playing a game with our bulbs. You can select Media mode to set

Co-FounderChief Executive OfficerAward-Winning Entrepreneur, Electrical Engineer, Creative Media Consultant@whosyourvladiOliver Sandovski



Co-FounderChief Operating OfficerExperienced in Industrial Engineering, 3D Modelling, Prototyping, Production & Logistics@oliverskiiWe have known each other for over 20 years, and have developed complementary abilities that, when combined, give us a complete skill set to ensure we can take MODR to the store shelves and beyond. Our experience with developing a sports entertainment product allowed us to battle the Dragons on CBC's Dragon's Den (unfortunately, the episode never aired), be featured in Popular Mechanics as the top gadget of the NY Toy Fair, win the 2009 Design Exchange Award for Engineering, and be featured on the CTV morning show. We have the entrepreneurship experience to take an idea from idea to consumer, plain and simple.JOIN THE SMARTPHONE REVOLUTION

We have the ability and the ingenuity to make MODR happen, and we come to you, our backers, for the cash to help us realize our goals. With your contributions, we will change the way people approach their smartphones, tablets and laptops forever. No longer will we be satisfied with paying exorbitant prices for only the most basic functionality in our smart devices and their cases.With MODR, you can upgrade your current phone without breaking the bank, and enjoy functionality not found anywhere else.
With the money raised by this campaign, we plan to create the molds for the Samsung Galaxy S4, S5 and S6 versions of our case, as well as for the reModules and X-Port accessories. We will purchase components in bulk to keep the costs down, and ensure that we will have short lead times while maintaining quality control. We will also use funds for app support, advertising, certifications, taxes, as well as any fees associated with crowdfunding. 



RISKS & CHALLENGES
Our challenges include the uncertainty of entering an untapped market, as well as competing against multi-million dollar companies. We are confident in our market research, and there is a massive untapped market that will now be served by MODR. Our experience in creating successful and unique electronics products will give us the tools needed to ensure we get the job done.

</h3><h3>A bit ""About Me"" and ""Background Check""<br/>
</h3>
<p>Hi. I am Gurudatt from India (you may 
call me Crypto Guru or just Guru) and started my first venture in 1991 
with my buddies writing software for airports and saving water in 
factories in India.</p>
<p>Post that, I worked with small and big (the largest in India) 
companies in India for about 20 years. In 2009, I started my own 
project, invested all my savings and started on the path to making 
online users secure, protecting their identity and information from 
hackers and marketeers or just people who want to steal and sell your 
data. With (when you agree to the terms of use of a website) or without 
your permission. </p>
<p>Initially I though I could create something and sell it to the banks, make a lot of money and then develop ""My"" project.</p>
<p>However, that did not happen as Banks did not want a secure system 
but a solution where they can make a lot more money by charging 
customers. </p>
<p>The out of band password-less authentication developed by me (which 
was a finalist at the Global Security Challenge in 2011 and vetted by 
Lockheed Martin/IC2 of Texas University) was considered ahead of its 
time by banks in India and quite low tech (as compared to Biometric 
authentication)  by western markets.
</p>
<p>I had to close down the venture as quickly as it started. However, 
the idea did not close down and you can see the tech in action on my 
latest project InviSocial.com </p>
<h3>Now Building ""Your"" Network<br/>
</h3>From being a ""My"" project, I want to make it a ""Your"" project. The current name is ""InviSocial"" which means Invi(sible) Social.  It is free to sign up and test it. <br/><br/><p>The world's most secure and private network. Be it for Social or Business, Community or Enterprise, the goal is to get online users taste, use and host their own encrypted network.</p>
<p>The Beta version is here. When I say ""Beta"" it means the product is not without bugs. So it will stay that way till the code is re-written from bottom up by a bunch of cool cat coders and designers.</p>
<p>Until then, this is the best out there. If you check the comparison of self hosted social networking services at <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_social_networking_software"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_social_networking_software</a></p>For the moment, to keep the project live and kicking, I seek your interest foremost and financial contribution.<br/><br/><h3>What is InviSocial, What can you do with it! </h3>Invisocial is not one thing but two things. The website <a href=""http://www.invisocial.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.invisocial.com</a> is a free social networking service that even businesses can use to create their own internal private network. <br/><br/>Using this FREE service, you can create an online profile such as the one I have created at Invisocial.com/gurudatt and keep blogging and turn your account into a blog. <br/><br/>If you are the social type,  you can invite your friends to Invisocial.com and use the service to privately share updates, pictures, files, contacts, online identities, bookmarks, etc All of which is secure and encrypted.<br/><br/>However, all of your data is resident on InviSocial.com's server which is very 
limited and cannot handle more than a few hundred users for now.  Which through your contribution the number can be bumped up to a few thousand users. Maybe more.<br/><br/>Now the second thing that InviSocial offers is the platform for create your own social network, blog, website on your own website or server using the very same features or with some customization. All in one working day. This is called the hosted version of Invisocial and which is a paid version and starts with $24.99 as the basic price. More about this is available on Invisocial.com/about<br/><br/><h3>How is InviSocial different from other Social Networks! </h3>For one, InviSocial is the only platform/service where all of the user data is encrypted. This is not just the password or email address but everything you post, your chat, your personal messages, contact lists, Everything.<br/><br/>This ensures that InviSocial offers the maximum privacy and security for your identity and information.<br/><br/>Second, InviSocial is completely advertisement free. There will and not be any advertisements. Putting third party advertisements not only is irritating but also can bring in viruses and thus there is no chance of such thing happening on InviSocial.com<br/><br/>There are no backdoors. There is no password recovery option. This means though we store your password in encrypted form, the encryption method used is so strong that even we cannot retrieve it if you forget it. You will have no option but to create a new account. However, we provide the option of exporting all your encrypted data and files and you can then import it to your new account. So better not forget your password. <br/><br/>Besides logging in using UserName/Password, Invisocial.com is the only website that offers Secure T-Pin password less authentication that works exactly like how you withdraw cash from an ATM machine. This T-Pin is registered by you and you can login to your account from only your computer. Your T-Pin will not work on another computer and allow them to access your account even if they come to know about it. Thus this offers hack proof protection from viruses that steal your login credentials. Using T-Pin secure login ensures that you do not have to use the normal username/password and can use it only for sign in from a computer where the T-Pin will not work. Using and Remembering T-Pin is more easy than a lengthy password. And locking it to your computer makes it highly secure.<br/><br/>Besides using InviSocial as a social network, you can create a internal network for your organization that is hidden or invisible to the rest of the members. <br/><br/>And finally unlike other mainstream social networks, InviSocial offers to host your own network on your own website and transfer the data from InviSocial.com whenever you decide to make the change.<br/><br/><br/><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold; line-height: 30px; font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">What is needed to keep the ball rolling</span><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px;"">.</span><br/></p>

<br/>For communication between modules we are using wire, 433 MHz radio, bluetooth or Wifi.
<br/>Due to absence of some worthwhile Arduino's mudules and sensors, we use the freely available commercial products. We choose this way to keep price on the acceptable level but you are this is the chance for other developers to make open source alternatives.

What is in the box?
enCardroiD and most of it's modules are based on the popular open-source electronics platform Arduino and credit-card sized computer Raspberry PI.
For communication between modules we are using wire, 433 MHz radio, bluetooth or Wifi.
Due to absence of some worthwhile Arduino's mudules and sensors, we use the freely available commercial products. We choose this way to keep price on the acceptable level but you are this is the chance for other developers to make open source alternatives.

<p>Our lives are increasingly dependent on
the Internet. It’s not just about your computer or a smartphone anymore—even
your thermostat, light bulbs, TV, and kitchen appliances can be “smart.” Because
of this, we are becoming more vulnerable: every device is a potential window of
opportunity for hackers.  </p>
<p>You probably know someone who was the
victim of identity or credit card theft, and you understand that children are
any scammer’s favorite targets.  We like
to think we’re ok, but all it takes is leaving one device unprotected.</p>
<p>Common ‘solutions’ to Internet security
problems are either too complicated or too expensive, so most people leave the
default settings on their routers and just go with the basic programs, and
don’t give it a second thought until disaster strikes.</p>
<p><b>THOSE
DEFAULT SETTINGS AND PROGRAMS AREN’T ENOUGH TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM</b>. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1435863113/o1oymv8izdmstdsc943b.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2>This is where DropAP comes in.</h2><div>

<p>According to the latest forecast from

<p>Last year, a security firm Proofpoint,

Internet-enabled security cameras and baby monitors. The cameras had faulty
software that left them open for online viewing, and in some instances
listening, by anyone with the cameras’ IP address. As a result, hundreds of consumers’
private video feeds were made public. 
Finally, earlier Wink Home Automation Hub outage left the users
powerless as a result of a bad security update.</p><h2>Choose A Reward For Your Peace Of Mind</h2>

house, office, and car, but how to you protect the doors to your online home?
Our lives are increasingly dependent on
the Internet. It’s not just about your computer or a smartphone anymore—even
your thermostat, light bulbs, TV, and kitchen appliances can be “smart.” Because
of this, we are becoming more vulnerable: every device is a potential window of
opportunity for hackers.  
You probably know someone who was the
victim of identity or credit card theft, and you understand that children are
any scammer’s favorite targets.  We like
to think we’re ok, but all it takes is leaving one device unprotected.
Common ‘solutions’ to Internet security
problems are either too complicated or too expensive, so most people leave the
default settings on their routers and just go with the basic programs, and
don’t give it a second thought until disaster strikes.
THOSE
DEFAULT SETTINGS AND PROGRAMS AREN’T ENOUGH TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. This is where DropAP comes in.

The DropAP solution
DropAP is a Smart and Secure Internet Access Solution.  This solution integrates Cloud Technology, Router Functionalities, and Mobile App Controls to provide overall family based protection at home and away.
Most Advanced Router Technology 
The DropAP Router is an advanced and high
performance Wireless Router that you can easily setup
and manage from your mobile devices, no installation required. Everything is
managed by the App communicating with the DropAP device. It can function as a
router, a Wi-Fi Wireless Router, or an extender.  Still, DropAP is even more than that: it’s
the easiest, safest, and most cost-effective way to keep your family’s Internet
usage monitored, safe, and protected. Unparalleled Parental Control Features 
The DropAP offers an affordable,
comprehensive solution for parents. We know that there are plenty of products
that claim to have parental control features, but they don’t come close to what
DropAP offers parents:  a way to set up
parental controls for every device to
monitor your child’s Internet usage in real time from wherever you are and
wherever your child’s devices are in the world thanks to DropAP’s cloud-based
infrastructure.  If that weren’t enough,
DropAP also gives parents a way to block site visits by simply listing the categories
and keywords you want to prevent your children from accessing. You can also limit
device usage by schedule or time limit—and it can all be done through the cloud. Efficiency with Economy
Traditionally, establishing a home Wi-Fi
network involved buying a router, buying additional software for each device,
and then updating software again and again to continue protection against malware.
To protect every device in your home, you’d have to spend hundreds of
dollars—not to mention hours—every year. If you didn’t do this, you’d just have
to pray that just hackers and scammers wouldn’t be interested in your data.DropAP eliminates all of that extra
cost, time, and hassle by combining the best-in-class home Wi-Fi router, PLUS
protection for ALL your mobile family devices, existing and new. No need to
purchase new security apps and programs ever again!ZAP: One-Click-Connect
DropAP believes the Internet should be
quick and easy to access.  Imagine with
one click, you can connect to the Internet, instantly and securely. No need for
passwords but secured.
Your guests can enjoy an easy, secure connection too. The DropAP
one-click-connect feature allows them to join your Wi-Fi network by simply

Because we are  always on the move, we must  perform  several  tasks  in  different  places:  at  home,  at  work, with our  clients,  when  we  wait,  when  we  travel,  at  our  friends'  parties, and  while  commuting.  We  always  want  to  have  a  computer, a tablet,  a  projector  or  a  device for playing games or watch TV. </p><p>However, we do  not  want  to  feel  the  burden  of  carrying  multiple  devices  or  carting  large  consoles  around  with  us. </p><p>With Masterkey, you  can simply  transform  your smart phone, which  is  always  with  you, into a powerful  little  device  that  satisfies  all your communications  and  gaming  needs.

<h3>Project Status</h3>
<p>As you can see from the timeline above, we're in the final phase.  Funds from this pre-order campaign will be used to fund manufacturing costs. Masterkey has been developed since 2014 and we're committed to building the coolest &amp;  the  most useful adapter for smart phones  on the market. We'd love to hear your candid and constructive feedback and would encourage those inclined to participate in our campaign.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our core business is hardware and the cloud.  We know the phone industry pretty well. We’ve been working with manufacturers and carriers, so everything we need is already in place. However, we are committed to bringing you a great product, and won't settle for anything less. Thus, during our manufacturing stage, we will actively work with our factory to make sure that everything is up to our standards. We recognize that this might result in a delay in our manufacturing process if complications arise, and we find it very important to make sure that these are shipped in a timely matter, but the quality comes first. This isn't our first rodeo but things seem to always come up and will be providing regular updates every 3 weeks to backers.</p>

Are You in Business? Masterkey 2.0  BE is the Easiest Way to Define Your Prospect's Hot Button.
Masterkey 2.0  Business Edition (BE) is designed for sales teams and businesses. Let's say you have a presentation in front of six people and you try to present your service or product which is too big or too small or maybe too complicated.What you need is a wearable smart projector. Masterkey 2.0  BE has a built in kinesthetic sensor and software that recognizes the interest in your presentation on the faces of your prospects.How it works (Business Edition)?We developed software that recognizes facial patterns (interested in, or not interested in), facial features, face recognition, gender and age recognition, detection of hand gestures, analysis and registration of images.While you're running your presentation, Masterkey 2.0  BE observes all prospects.

We’re a tech company that  believes in innovation through collaboration. Whatever we do we want to create a product that will make people happier.Team members are from US and EU. Most of them are HW & SW experts.What we stand forWith our knowledge and  product  we strongly believe that we can help business and sale staff  growing faster and reliable.  After all, customers count most.CharityWe would like to align ourselves with some charities that help people get to and from where they need to go. Do you have any ideas of some great ones? Possibly a Veteran’s organization, or any others that could help them out.                                 Our  StoryMy  name  is  Michael. I'm  a  computer  expert  and  an  enterpreneur. I also develop  computer  peripherals. In  my  spare  time,  I  like to cycle,  watch movies,  and  enjoy   delicious  food at  restaurants  . I  came  up  with  the  idea  for  the  Masterkey  adapter  on  one  of  my  business  trips. Because we are  always on the move, we must  perform  several  tasks  in  different  places:  at  home,  at  work, with our  clients,  when  we  wait,  when  we  travel,  at  our  friends'  parties, and  while  commuting.  We  always  want  to  have  a  computer, a tablet,  a  projector  or  a  device for playing games or watch TV. However, we do  not  want  to  feel  the  burden  of  carrying  multiple  devices  or  carting  large  consoles  around  with  us. With Masterkey, you  can simply  transform  your smart phone, which  is  always  with  you, into a powerful  little  device  that  satisfies  all your communications  and  gaming  needs. In many cases better than others. You  can  use  it  anywhere  and  anytime  with  all  of  the applications  that  exist  on  the  market.We've  invested  a lot  of  effort,  time,  knowledge,  and  funds  into  this  project. The  best  and  the   highest  quality  suppliers  have  been  chosen for the components, manufacturers and developers .  Product Development Manufacturing
 
Project Status
As you can see from the timeline above, we're in the final phase.  Funds from this pre-order campaign will be used to fund manufacturing costs. Masterkey has been developed since 2014 and we're committed to building the coolest &  the  most useful adapter for smart phones  on the market. We'd love to hear your candid and constructive feedback and would encourage those inclined to participate in our campaign.
 
Risks & Challenges
Our core business is hardware and the cloud.  We know the phone industry pretty well. We’ve been working with manufacturers and carriers, so everything we need is already in place. However, we are committed to bringing you a great product, and won't settle for anything less. Thus, during our manufacturing stage, we will actively work with our factory to make sure that everything is up to our standards. We recognize that this might result in a delay in our manufacturing process if complications arise, and we find it very important to make sure that these are shipped in a timely matter, but the quality comes first. This isn't our first rodeo but things seem to always come up and will be providing regular updates every 3 weeks to backers.

<p>Driven primarily out of the aggravation of broken and inferior quality charging cables my team and I went on a journey to produce a cable that solved the short comings of conventional cables, we wanted <strong>one cable for all devices</strong>, it had to be <strong>durable</strong>, <strong>would not break</strong> and capable of charging devices <strong>fast</strong>.

</div></div>","Charging cables have become an integral part of all of our everyday lives and a broken or incompatible charging cable amounts to an almost insurmountable crisis.

Driven primarily out of the aggravation of broken and inferior quality charging cables my team and I went on a journey to produce a cable that solved the short comings of conventional cables, we wanted one cable for all devices, it had to be durable, would not break and capable of charging devices fast. ITIPz was born.

Our team of designers and engineers went through numerous iterations of design and rigorous testing to accomplish the ITIPz premium quality product for apple and android devices.


With the global movement towards USB-C, the next logical step was for us to develop the USB-C magnetic tip. We have started with the design and early prototypes and need your backing to assist us in bringing it to fruition. 
USB-C inserts for Magnetic tip.

<p>It is long overdue “We the People” take our credentials back from those that don't take the necessary measurements to prevent our identification and credentials secure and private! Daily we are seeing our personal lives getting hacked and stolen. This needs to STOP! My SS# was compromised and some illegal alien was using it! Every 2 seconds another person's identification is stolen! This is an emergency right NOW!</p>
<p>The people and companies we have entrusted are not doing their job and we are all vulnerable. All the agencies could have fixed this longtime ago just by taking the situation more seriously and by investing a small amount of additional capital.

<p>Everyone can help by donating whatever they can and be sure to contact your Congressional representative and inform them about this cause.</p>

Everything is thought out to the smallest detail, the materials are carefully selected to provide you with an experience and design that you will never get with another smartphone.  Designed in Sweden, Symetium features a unique monolithic and minimalistic design without any visible camera lenses or camera cutouts on the front or back. Every detail and material has been thoughtfully chosen to give you a unique and clean design that you’ll have never seen before. And, with the adjustable virtual bezel you won't have any issues holding it in any situation.     A Desktop PC In Your Pocket Powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 865, and with 12 GB of RAM, Symetium was never designed to be a smartphone it was designed to be a desktop computer. Symetium can provide you with a great and productive experience, whether you're a gamer that wants to connect it to a tv with a controller,  or a businessman or businesswoman that wants to work on the go, the desktop UI has been designed to give you the same experience as a desktop computer with no limitations.   A Gaming Smartphone As Well! Symetium is great for gaming and media as well!Connect it to a TV with a controller and get a media center UI optimized for controllers like Android TV to turn Symetium into both a media center device and a gaming console.Powered by Dolby Atmos, Symetium features two powerful stereo speakers for a rich and powerful sound. And of course, it has a 3.5 mm headphone jack. Not all trends are useful :), we even opted for an IR blaster so you can control your tv while streaming to it.  Powerful 5500 mAh Battery Symetium has an incredible 5500mah battery and quick charge 4.0 to last you through the day and beyond, using the supplied glass panel you can also enable qi wireless charging, The charger can also be used with AAA batteries, so you can transform your charger into a mini power bank in case of emergency.  Lifelike Display Symetium is equipped with a bezel-less 90hz 4k HDR OLED display for vibrant colors and deep blacks, with its 90hz refresh rate you will get a fluid lag-free performance for both gaming and anything else. There is also an advanced built-in calibration tool with everything from whitebalance to contrast and more, that can store calibration profiles so you can calibrate the colors after the sRGB or Adobe RGB or DCI-P3 color space or punchy and vibrant colors with the included ""Vibrancy+"" calibration preset, choose which apps your custom profiles should apply to, so you can have accurate true to life colors when you choose.     
One Camera Fits All The modular camera system of Symetium also features Sonys 48 Megapixel flagship sensor imx586 for the best quality photos whether you want to take a selfie or photos of the world.With its modular design, you will be able to upgrade to a multiple camera setup with the lenses you desire, and with its magnetic design you can attach it anywhere on Symetium or somewhere else, Symetium also features a camera holder so you can pull the camera out or rotate it for easy access or to take highly detailed selfies, the camera module itself is waterproof so you don’t have to worry about getting it wet, if you prefer to have a visible camera lens you can also get the optional camera lens panel so you don’t have to pull out the camera when you want to take a photo.We also built in a two-stage camera shutter key so you will never miss a shot. Turn Symetium into a mini computer We also designed a stylish metal case with a built-in QWERTY keyboard and a trackpad.This elegant case protects your phone and turns your Symetium into a mini computer!  Invulnerable Design With Symetium you don’t need to worry about scratches. Unlike many expensive brand new smartphones, which you can easily and permanently scratch, The display of Symetium is designed to be recessed which allows you to install a screen protector invisibly without affecting design or function. You don’t need to buy it separately - a tempered glass screen protector already comes pre-installed.  Symetium comes with a magnetic back panel, so you can switch to other colors and materials to suit your style or replace a scratched panel with a new one.The inside has a window to the hardware inside, so you can turn Symetium into a transparent phone, just by using the supplied clear glass back panel. Don’t worry if you lose your panel, the inside is waterproof, so even without a back panel you will still be protected from water and dust.  Symetium also supports QI wireless charging if you use the supplied glass panel, and with the optional open camera lens panel, you don’t have to remove the camera to take a photo..   A Beautiful UI Based On Design And Function! SymetiumUI is designed to work as a desktop operating system as well as a mobile operating system, with elegance in mind. The thoughtfully made design will harmoniously reflect the wallpaper you're using, with the translucent design it will dynamically adapt its UI design and dynamic home button to your wallpaper. Symetium also features a dynamic notification led and home button so you can choose what notification led style you want, and with the built-in UI customization, you can customize the translucency or turn it off completely. You can also connect Symetium via USB type C to an HDMI display, for a full desktop experience with a mouse and keyboard without any need for a dock.  Unlike standard Android, SymetiumOS intelligently organizes applications and files into separate categories — for example, an image gallery, as well as image-related widgets. This was done to ensure that applications and data were clean and organized and that the user could better control the operation of the PC operating system.   Choose Your Android And Modify It Symetium will come with an untouched stock Android one pre-installed. But you can upgrade it to SymetiumOS. No PC is needed, just plug in the supplied USB flash drive to Symetium and let the system do the rest.By giving you the opportunity to choose between stock android and SymetiumOS or any other ROM such as LineageOS, we want to show our openness to third-party modifications.  We are personally tired of the smartphones that ""die"" as soon as the manufacturers stop updating them. We are going to keep Symetium up to date as long as we can with a guaranteed 2 years of updates on SymetiumOS and longer on stock android, We also greet others to creating custom ROMs to keep Symetium alive for many years to come and we will release everything you need to modify your Symetium to your heart's content without having your warranty voided!Because that’s what Android is all about, freedom and customization! First Class Security with Symetium you will be able to encrypt apps or data using fingerprint or a passcode or both, Symetium also features advanced anti theft features such as protection mode, protection mode will turn on if a force reboot or soft reset has been initiated or if the Sim Card has been removed, Protection mode let's you listen to the microphone or track your device as well as displaying messages on the screen, Protection mode will also continuously connect to any nearby open Wi-Fi connection to keep tracking enabled even if threes no connection available.  Protection mode will run silently and the device will appear off and refuse to start it will just display a fake low battery warning when trying to boot unless you choose to display a message on the screen remotely, Protection mode can be disabled if you hold the power button for 10 seconds,Protection mode will also let you reserve battery which won't be used during normal operation so you know there's always battery available for protection mode, Protection mode can also be configured to initiate when the non-reserved battery has been fully depleted Symetium will also perform a silent system wipe if you input a unique pin code of your choice when unlocking your device, this is useful if you are forced to unlock your device and don't want your data to fall into the wrong hands, to abort the operation simply hold on the power off button in the power menu, this can of course also be pass-code protected.            Symetium pay a securely encrypted cryptowallet

Safeskin addresses this head on with the first hardware solution.The button works with a 0.026in (0.65mm) tactile switch, making it so slim that you would never guess it’s a completely separate button.Lightining Compatiable: Keep your phone charged without having to worry about the case getting in the way.6 layer HDI PCBCommunicates with the iPhone through Apple-approved ProtocolOur Case is Drop Proof! Made out of a strong but flexible material, PC ABS, Safeskin absorbs the shock and prevents the phone from breaking. The touchscreen starts save with the case slightly above the phone’s screen.How loud is the alarm on the Eye?It is 100 dB.How long is the alert and how do I switch off?It keeps on alerting until the Case and Eye get back into each other’s safety range and the owner presses the button for 5 seconds on the Eye.What is the range of the alert distance? There are two different options. The user can choose between them in the application. There is a smaller range (about 30 feet) and a larger one (about 100 feet).What happens if I go to the bathroom with my phone in my pocket, but the Eye remains in my bag?If your alarm function is turned on then as soon as you get out of the Eye’s safety range both accessories will start to alarm. You can easily turn this off by pushing the button of the Eye for 5 seconds. And in case your in a SafeZone that you have set up earlier then the alarm won’t even go off.How do I switch back to normal mode after an alert?You just have to switch off the alarm by pressing the button on the Eye for 5 seconds within in the Case’s safety range. As soon as the alarm turns off everything is automaticallay back to normal.How do I find my keys, bag etc. if I am using several Eyes?You can easily manage your Eyes in the Safeskin application. When you put a given Eye on any of your belongings, you can name it in the app. When you are looking for something then you can simply ring the given Eye with light or sound or both through the application.What happens if I lose my Eye?You can’t loose your Eye because it is virtually connected to the phone. So if you were to lose it then both would start to alarm.How do I prevent a false alert, eg. my kids are playing with the my phone/Eye?You can set a SafeZone or a SafeTime in the app.How do I take off the case?You get a key included in your Eye. With that you need to turn the three locks to match your own color code. You receive your own color code in the application, right after you connect the case to your phone.What happens if I lose my keys and forget the color code?You cannot lose your keys because it is inside the Eye which is always wirelessly connected to your phone and Case. You can always see your color code by logging into the app with your own credentials.Is the Case/Eye compatible with Android phones?Not at the moment. However, we are planning on developing Safeskin for Androids as well in the future.What is the material of the Case? Is it drop proof?The material of the case is PC ABS. Yes, the case is drop proof.Can I pay with my phone if the Case is on my phone?Yes, NFC works with our case on.Does wireless charging work with my Case on?Yes wireless charging works through the Safeskin Case.What is the extra function of your application, comparing it with ""Find my iPhone""?You can manage all your Eyes and thus find your different belongings as well. And you can also manage your safety settings.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Let's START!!</p>
<p><u><strong>Who we are?</strong></u></p>
<p>We are Sertea Web.                                <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517406029/wpxjjcele2cibjqkcoj7.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Sertea Web</strong> is a spin off of an <strong>Italian company</strong> that has created a multi-channel communication platform. We design and develop a technology platform elder age-friendly, in a Technological Park near Milan.</p>
<p><u><strong>Reasons for our project?</strong></u></p>
<p>In the last 50 years, the socio-economic development of most countries has been accompanied by a significant reduction in fertility and increases in life expectancy. According to the latest estimates, by 2050 in the world 1 person every 5 will be 60 years or more.</p>
<p><u><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517392858/tpwxmposqqyndhrsq2um.png"" src=""""/></strong></u></p>
<p>The elderly population, in fact, will double from 900 million individuals to almost 2 billion. With 21.4% of citizens over 65 Italy is the second country in the world for longevity after Japan.</p>
<p>Elderly people, in most cases, are unable to use smartphone, for example due to vision problem. Our purpose is to help them. </p>
<p>This work, in fact, addresses elderly people who DO NOT use smarthphone. </p>
<p>We have considered that innovating does not necessarily mean inventing something new, but also better using what we already have. So by Following this philosophy, the normal home phone we all know has been revolutionized.</p>
<p><i><u>WE INNOVATE THE PARADIGM OF COMMUNICATION TELEPHONE / TELEVISION!</u></i><br/>Now communication technology is no longer an obstacle for elderly people. <strong>Making calls with the TV means using a technological tool available to each generation.</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517394094/qs2myjx0bp4wv2lpzwy5.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>What is HomePhone?</strong></u></p>
</div><div>
<p>The real HomePhone is a new concept device that transforms YOUR home television into a smartphone!<br/>It is carefully designed for people security and home care of seniors and the sick.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517392909/tvvo3lyn4pbezzkklfon.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/>In case of necessity, like a car failure or a illness, HomePhone allows to get your phone call or a SMS on television at home.<br/>HomePhone is able to display the message (SMS/PUSH) or the entry call on the screen, turning on the television (if switched off or in stand-by) or switching the program if the TV is on, forcing your family members to answer.<br/>When you close the Pop-up and switch-off the alarm with your TV remote controller (OK button), you confirm that you have received the message.</p>
<p><strong>FOR THIS REASON HOMEPHONE ALWAYS GIVES YOU THE CERTAINTY OF REACHING THE DESIRED PERSON!!</strong></p>
<p>It also has an EMERGENCY BUTTON. This is designed for a sudden domestic accident (like a stroke, heart attack, fall with consequent fractures, thief intrusion). Interested person can easily push the button and send an alert message to pre-defined contact list.</p>

<div class=""""><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/fYqZnOQdxWw?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
</div></div>
<div> </div>
<p>Finally, it is designed as a Telemedicine device. In fact, it is able to collect data concerning vital parameters and send them to hospital facilities, for a remote analysis or save into servers.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1517406336/bgih61dnopmrxzcz9q8r.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><u>Feature:</u></p>
<p>• HomePhone makes them talk with the TV, being equipped with SIM, Bluetooth, WiFi, HDMI, USB, Apps<br/>• Compatible with TV model produced from 2005 onwards<br/>• Self-installing<br/>• Profile set-up through web app (contact list, emergency number)</p>
<p><i><u><strong>The Real HomePhone is covered by international patent applications.</strong></u></i></p>
<p>We need 850.000 $ to go from the prototype to the real industrialization. In particular we have to produce a minimus of 1400 working device and this sum that we request is necessary for cover all the production cost and other fees. No profit for us, only the need to start the production and transform our project into reality. </p>
<h3>Prizes and Awards</h3>
<p><i><u>1) Digital 360 Awards 2017</u></i></p>
<p>On the 28th of June we have been selected ""the best telecommunications solution"" by a jury of 53 CIOs of the major companies operating in our country!!!!</p>
<p>We won in the category of telecommunications and were finalist in the category of IoT (Internet of Things) and Big Data Analytics at the Digital 360 Awards.</p>

Sertea Web is a spin off of an Italian company that has created a multi-channel communication platform. We design and develop a technology platform elder age-friendly, in a Technological Park near Milan.
Reasons for our project?
In the last 50 years, the socio-economic development of most countries has been accompanied by a significant reduction in fertility and increases in life expectancy. According to the latest estimates, by 2050 in the world 1 person every 5 will be 60 years or more.

The elderly population, in fact, will double from 900 million individuals to almost 2 billion. With 21.4% of citizens over 65 Italy is the second country in the world for longevity after Japan.
Elderly people, in most cases, are unable to use smartphone, for example due to vision problem. Our purpose is to help them. 
This work, in fact, addresses elderly people who DO NOT use smarthphone. 
We have considered that innovating does not necessarily mean inventing something new, but also better using what we already have. So by Following this philosophy, the normal home phone we all know has been revolutionized.
WE INNOVATE THE PARADIGM OF COMMUNICATION TELEPHONE / TELEVISION!Now communication technology is no longer an obstacle for elderly people. Making calls with the TV means using a technological tool available to each generation.

 
What is HomePhone?

The real HomePhone is a new concept device that transforms YOUR home television into a smartphone!It is carefully designed for people security and home care of seniors and the sick.
In case of necessity, like a car failure or a illness, HomePhone allows to get your phone call or a SMS on television at home.HomePhone is able to display the message (SMS/PUSH) or the entry call on the screen, turning on the television (if switched off or in stand-by) or switching the program if the TV is on, forcing your family members to answer.When you close the Pop-up and switch-off the alarm with your TV remote controller (OK button), you confirm that you have received the message.
FOR THIS REASON HOMEPHONE ALWAYS GIVES YOU THE CERTAINTY OF REACHING THE DESIRED PERSON!!
It also has an EMERGENCY BUTTON. This is designed for a sudden domestic accident (like a stroke, heart attack, fall with consequent fractures, thief intrusion). Interested person can easily push the button and send an alert message to pre-defined contact list.


 

 
Finally, it is designed as a Telemedicine device. In fact, it is able to collect data concerning vital parameters and send them to hospital facilities, for a remote analysis or save into servers.

Feature:
• HomePhone makes them talk with the TV, being equipped with SIM, Bluetooth, WiFi, HDMI, USB, Apps• Compatible with TV model produced from 2005 onwards• Self-installing• Profile set-up through web app (contact list, emergency number)
The Real HomePhone is covered by international patent applications.
We need 850.000 $ to go from the prototype to the real industrialization. In particular we have to produce a minimus of 1400 working device and this sum that we request is necessary for cover all the production cost and other fees. No profit for us, only the need to start the production and transform our project into reality.

<p>Ignition have finally decided to bring the users some simple merchandise that they have asked for. That merchandise would be cases! We have decided to go with the Apple Silicone style cases with the same quality but for an affordable price.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We need $500 to get our first 200 cases.</li>
<li>By supporting our campaign you get the case and you also get a personalised letter when your case is delivered. </li>
<li>If we do not reach our goal all funds go directly back into Ignition and making it better for everybody.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul><li>By supporting our campaign you'll be helping us provide you with great cases but for a great price whilst still helping Ignition.</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>During the process of creating the cases we will have to continuously talk with our suppliers to try and get the best pricing to keep the price of the cases down.</li>
<li>We have experience dealing with wholesalers and working them down to a reasonable price.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't support our campaign directly you can always try the following!</p>
<ul>
<li>Spread the word! Make some noise about our campaign!</li>

Ignition have finally decided to bring the users some simple merchandise that they have asked for. That merchandise would be cases! We have decided to go with the Apple Silicone style cases with the same quality but for an affordable price.

What We Need & What You Get

We need $500 to get our first 200 cases.
By supporting our campaign you get the case and you also get a personalised letter when your case is delivered. 
If we do not reach our goal all funds go directly back into Ignition and making it better for everybody.


The Impact
By supporting our campaign you'll be helping us provide you with great cases but for a great price whilst still helping Ignition.

Risks & Challenges

During the process of creating the cases we will have to continuously talk with our suppliers to try and get the best pricing to keep the price of the cases down.
We have experience dealing with wholesalers and working them down to a reasonable price.


Other Ways You Can Help
If you can't support our campaign directly you can always try the following!

Spread the word! Make some noise about our campaign!
You can also use the Indigogo share tools to help!

And that's all there is to it.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

I am a hardware developer that makes all sorts of fun/functional/funky gadgets for the <a href=""http://www.jolla.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Jolla phone</a>. <br/><br/>This is me:<br/><p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441299313/hgzuz3qlekozosv91z0b.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 242px; height: 298px;""/><br/></p>
<br/><p>Jolla has now made a beautiful tablet and I want to make a carbonfiber casing for it. Carbonfiber is awesome! It looks great and offers great protection. Keep it light, keep it sporty, keep it Funky!<br/></p>
<br/><h3>The idea</h3>
<p>The tablet is beautiful, but as with all other tablets it has a very large glass area which makes it vulnerable to scratches and cracking. Without a strong protective casing it is a bad plan to throw it in your backpack with all your other stuff. <br/></p>
<p>Things like charging cables, pens, other electronics or even books can put concentrated loads on the screen which can easily crack a screen. Having a strong casing covering the screen with a soft inner lining will remove all the concentrated loads, by absorbing a lot of the force and spreading it over a large surface area. <br/></p>
<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441731634/exzt17cnqmbdszamhn75.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 452.307px; height: 339px;""/><p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>During use you can easily slide of the casing and put it 
in the normal position, exposing the screen. Due to the flat surface on 
the back, placing it on rough surfaces will certainly scratch the back 
panel. Not good. Slap a casing around it and you can place it down 
anywhere. <br/></p>
<p>Being able to carry the tablet around with you  and
 use it wherever without worries increases the functionality and will 
guarantuee a longer life without cracks and scratches. </p>Sounds good right? And as an added bonus it also looks awesome!<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441732296/f9km6lhyzhnuvgef9lsm.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 464px; height: 348px;""/></p>

</h4>
<p>You will get a carbonfiber/epoxy casing with a nice satin

This is laminated using epoxy resin with a 'wet lay up' method. This is a fancy term for 'lay down the carbon by hand, pour the epoxy from a cup, distribute it evenly with your creditcard and go over it will a paintroller to sqeeze out the air'.
A plastic sheet is tensioned over the wet laminate and tensioned by hand. Small air bubbles under the plastic are removed by going over it again with a roller.

<h3>The DAC</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Hifime are making a new <a href=""http://hifimediy.com/Sabre-9018-DAC"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sabre 9018 DAC</a> that will feature the ESS Sabre 9018 chip at a very affordable price! The DAC will be available with the regular USB plug for sure, so this campaign is just a chance to get it with Type-C plug.</p>
<p>We have picked the most important features to include in this DAC to be able to make a incredible sounding DAC at this low price. The most important parts in a DAC is the DAC chip, the headphone driver (if any), the power supply and the circuit. We are using a great sounding pair (ES9018k2m DAC+SABRE9601 driver) and have added extra noise reducing capacitors to smoothen the USB power. <br/></p>
<p>It will come in this new nice looking plastic case which is still simple and keeping cost down.<br/></p>

<p>
</p>
<p><b>Features</b></p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Sabre ES9018k2m DAC chip and SABRE9601 headphone and line out driver</li>
<li>Works and sound great with most headphone (including low impedance IEM and high impedance headphones) and all line level devices (preamps, amplifiers)</li>
<li>No drivers required for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iPhones</li>
<li>Accepts 32kHz, 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 88.2kHz and 96kHz</li>
<li>Volume controlled by computer vol +/- keys<br/>
</li>
<li>Optical output<br/>
</li>
<li>122dB SNR <br/>
</li>
<li>110dB THD+N: 2Vrms @ 600 ohm load<br/>
</li>
<li>100dB THD+N: 30mW @ 32 ohm load</li>
<li>40-80 mA power usage (depends on volume and sample rate)<br/>
</li>
<li>Dimensions: 5.5 x 3.5 x 1.8 cm (without cable)<br/>
</li>
<li>Weight 30 gram</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Sabre 9018 DAC can play any format (MP3, AIFF, FLAC etc) from CD quality up to 96kHz and 24 bit. It does not support 196k or 384kHz natively, nor does it play DSD files. <b>Why</b>? Most people does not have 192/384/DSD files. You do not benefit from a 384kHz capable DAC when playing CD quality (or high resolution 96kHz) files. If you need a 192kHz/384kHz/DSD DAC then we have other options for you. We have intentionally omitted this for all of our customers that don’t play 384kHz/DSD so you can save and get a better sounding CD quality DAC.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><i>I thought higher resolution is better??</i></p>
<p>If you have bough high resolution 192kHz or 384kHz files then yes it is better to have a DAC capable of decoding 192/384kHz without downsampling. If you play CD’s, MP3, FLAC, Apple lossless, Spotify, Tidal high resolution etc then you will not benefit from a 192/384kHz capable DAC.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The benefits of 96/24 include:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>No drivers required!</li>
<li>Responds to system volume level in detailed 64 steps</li>
<li>It works with the <a href=""http://hifimediy.com/usb-isolator"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">USB isolator</a> to further reduce noise from the computer and improve clarity and sound quality</li>

We are using a great sounding pair (ES9018k2m DAC+SABRE9601 driver) and have added extra noise reducing capacitors to smoothen the USB power. 
It will come in this new nice looking plastic case which is still simple and keeping cost down.







Features


Sabre ES9018k2m DAC chip and SABRE9601 headphone and line out driver
Works and sound great with most headphone (including low impedance IEM and high impedance headphones) and all line level devices (preamps, amplifiers)
No drivers required for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iPhones
Accepts 32kHz, 44.1kHz, 48kHz, 88.2kHz and 96kHz
Volume controlled by computer vol +/- keys

Optical output

122dB SNR 

110dB THD+N: 2Vrms @ 600 ohm load

100dB THD+N: 30mW @ 32 ohm load
40-80 mA power usage (depends on volume and sample rate)

Dimensions: 5.5 x 3.5 x 1.8 cm (without cable)

Weight 30 gram




The Sabre 9018 DAC can play any format (MP3, AIFF, FLAC etc) from CD quality up to 96kHz and 24 bit. It does not support 196k or 384kHz natively, nor does it play DSD files. Why? Most people does not have 192/384/DSD files. You do not benefit from a 384kHz capable DAC when playing CD quality (or high resolution 96kHz) files. If you need a 192kHz/384kHz/DSD DAC then we have other options for you. We have intentionally omitted this for all of our customers that don’t play 384kHz/DSD so you can save and get a better sounding CD quality DAC.



I thought higher resolution is better??
If you have bough high resolution 192kHz or 384kHz files then yes it is better to have a DAC capable of decoding 192/384kHz without downsampling. If you play CD’s, MP3, FLAC, Apple lossless, Spotify, Tidal high resolution etc then you will not benefit from a 192/384kHz capable DAC.


The benefits of 96/24 include:


No drivers required!
Responds to system volume level in detailed 64 steps
It works with the USB isolator to further reduce noise from the computer and improve clarity and sound quality
Don’t pay extra for what you don’t need




How you can help
 We need to order several thousands of the Type-C cables. As this is a new plug it is fairly expensive at this time.
If we receive enough preorders then we will go ahead with it and take the chance that we'll sell the remaining eventually. 
All preorders are shipped first with registered mail.
As we have already started making the DAC, we will be able to order the type C cables and finish them quickly. It will be ready in January about 3 weeks after the campaign end.
The Impact

 You can be one of the first to get a USB type C DAC for your Nexus or Macbook ! 
USB type C is for sure a great step forward and although you can use an adaptor instead of a native cable it's very convenient to plug it directly.  Any risks? The DAC is already in production. If there is not enough interest for the type C plug, then we are still making the same DAC with the normal USB plug and you can consider getting it instead.
Other Ways You Can Help

 Please spread the word to your audiophile friends with new Nexus phones, new Macbooks or other laptops with the type C USB!",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3><b>The Main Idea</b></h3>
<p>I started developing the Triband based on the amount of power we need to use in our daily life. While still in college, I would find myself with low power with my phone leaving me stranded without anyone to call. I would consider myself quite the forgetful fellow. </p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1411572/files/20150424052719-FlashDrive_Icon.png?1429878439"" src="""" style=""width: 98px; height: 98px;""/></h3>
<h3><b>Flash Drive Issue</b></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I've always had a major issue keeping track of my flash drives, I've definitely lost over 20 flash drives over my 6 year long college career. Older projects have been lost which I could have used in my line of work, and redoing projects that i've lost in the process wasn't fun. I'd want to avoid having to run back and forth between my apartment and school/work.</span></p>

<h3><b>Night Time Issue</b></h3>
<h3></h3>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">I always loved the night, with the awesome shiny dots in the sky (we call em stars, in lion king, they're fireflies stuck in the sky. Those poor poor fireflies...), but sometimes it gets a little bit troublesome when walking down a dark alley way or getting things from your lightless garage. I've actually walked into a pole on my way home more than once (true story).</span></p>

<h3><b>Ending Notes</b></h3>
<p>In a way, this is a product I am making for myself back in the past. I am sure that Triband can help others whether it be school, work, camping, meetings, and other possible uses. But its always nice to have something conveniently located where you can grab it easily (you can stop looking through your backpack/bag/purse now).</p>

Update #4.5 - Hardware Sneakpeak
Heres a quick sneakpeak and preview of the internals of Triband Plus! I wanted to do a one shot video and everything isn't perfect, but i hope that you like it :)

The Main Idea
I started developing the Triband based on the amount of power we need to use in our daily life. While still in college, I would find myself with low power with my phone leaving me stranded without anyone to call. I would consider myself quite the forgetful fellow. 

Flash Drive Issue
I've always had a major issue keeping track of my flash drives, I've definitely lost over 20 flash drives over my 6 year long college career. Older projects have been lost which I could have used in my line of work, and redoing projects that i've lost in the process wasn't fun. I'd want to avoid having to run back and forth between my apartment and school/work.




Night Time Issue

I always loved the night, with the awesome shiny dots in the sky (we call em stars, in lion king, they're fireflies stuck in the sky. Those poor poor fireflies...), but sometimes it gets a little bit troublesome when walking down a dark alley way or getting things from your lightless garage. I've actually walked into a pole on my way home more than once (true story).



Ending Notes
In a way, this is a product I am making for myself back in the past. I am sure that Triband can help others whether it be school, work, camping, meetings, and other possible uses. But its always nice to have something conveniently located where you can grab it easily (you can stop looking through your backpack/bag/purse now).

We've kept the cost low on designing, R&D, and prototyping as we did mostly everything ourselves. The main cost will go to molding/tooling, mass production, and shipping.








Christopher ChengI graduated from San Jose State University Spring 2013 with a Computer Engineering BS. Since then (and during my time at SJSU), I've worked as a Field Application Engineer in home automation for over 3 years and another year in game development. I've taken a new turn to work as an entrepreneur/inventor as the creator of Triband Plus. Through my new taken experience, I've started designing, terrible videography, and animating all which make a really nice hobby (really fun too!).


The Team of Memes











I'll be covering milestones up until recently, this portion will update as we finish more on the product. I have neglected anything related to PR and marketing, and finding manufacturers and other helpful companies.

Designing the Triband(11/15/2014)I've gone through a horrendous amount of iterations until i came to the final design of it. Here, take a look at some of these disasters.

Now here's the final design that went straight into 3D designing.

Hardware Prototype V1 Development (01/15/2015)

At this point, I have actually accomplished a lot! It seems like I'm so close to finishing this project. But of course, its never that simple.You could charge a mobile phone, charge the Triband itself, but using it as a charging cable didn't work. Of course I had to do a complete redesign of the hardware to make it work (lame). Instead of spending more time, i've decided to find someone who can help with the overall redesign and even manufacture the hardware for us.
But during this time, we realized we need to get a 3D design and an Industrial Design in order to push our project further. The Industrial design could cause us to completely redesign the hardware and having to push through a higher R&D (research and development) cost [but it didn't].
3D Design (01/19/2015)We probably should have worked on the 3D design first before moving on to hardware, or at least have both working at the same time, but the Industrial design may cause us to redesign anyways. Its hard to say when we actually have to had start the hardware design. But since we have the hardware already working, we have proved that the Triband can potentially work as a product for all the end consumers.I present to you our next milestone! We are moving forward, and that is the most important thing that you can do with any project.Industrial Design (02/10/2015)We've finally got our Industrial design finished, and somehow the size of our PCB board fits in perfectly. Though we had to make changes to the size of the battery multiple times before we got this right. With this, we can define the cost of molding the Triband for the final stage of development.

Non-working Prototype (03/15/2015)For marketing purposes, we developed a non-working prototype. I was so happy to get this in my hand as it was like bringing up a baby into growth. Though it doesn't work, I can't wait to have a working prototype on hand (you would have seen most of our pictures were taken with this prototype, but the plastic lock broke after a month of use, but no worries! We'll be using an aluminum lock which should last forever).Hardware Prototype V2 (05/05/15)We've finished the final version of the hardware that will go into the working prototype. We won't start it right away since there is so much to do before hand. But here are some images! I will be posting videos later on to show off all the functions sometimes in the middle of our campaign!

Production and Quality Assurance


During production, anything can happen. From parts not fitting in right, terrible assembly of our product. We'll have to push up some trust and hope that none of these happens through our current team.

There is a second problem associated to production, we have found out that our product will be very hard to put together without damaging it due to the nature of having the FPC wires in the band. It is projected that there will be a fail rate of 10 - 20% during the injection mold phase of assembly. We are looking for a injection molding company right now that is confident in putting our product together. (At some point, I believe one of the companies have tried to trick me with their extremely low price!)

After molding and assembling the final product, we'll run a burn test (20 hours of various tests) on all Triband Go Companion assembled to ensure that every single product is working before being shipped out to our backers. Safety and quality is our number one priority!

Shipment 2 Backers


Shipping is always complicated when it comes to shipping multiple projects. Things can go wrong, packages go missing, and many complaints filed.

Though finding someone who will be able to handle all the shipment and figure out the logistics helps! With the help of one of the guys in the team, he has massive knowledge on shipping packages to everywhere in the world. He is one hard worker, and we are slowly figuring out the logistics of shipping as we go. If any packages didn't seem to make it to its destination, contact us and let us know so we can make things right and find out what happened.

<b>FAQ'S</b><br/><br/><b>Q: Can I buy EndlessWine if I don't live in the USA?</b><br/>A: We have this crowdfund disabled for users foreign to the USA.  This is mostly because our wine distribution partner only ships to the USA.  As we get distribution partners in other countries, we will open up sales of the Units to those countries.<br/><br/><b>Q:  Is there anything special I need to make EndlessWine work in my house?<br/></b>A:  You need wifi access so that the rack can communicate via the internet with the ordering program.  You need an Android or Apple Smartphone in order to download and install the free companion app. Also, the rack needs to be plugged in.  So you'll need a power outlet near where you plan to keep your rack.<br/>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>We understand that not everyone is in a position to support us financially, but that doesn't mean you can't help!  Help us now by doing one of the following:<br/><br/>1.  Tell every single (living) wine drinking human you know about this.  Post it on all the social media outlets you can (use the Indiegogo tools for this).<br/>2.  Comment on this page.  Tell us what you think.<br/>3.  The next time you have a glass of wine....think about us :)<br/>

invention of Endless Wine. We think the world is now a better place!
:)The concept is simple really:1st....we start with a simple 5 position wooden construction wine rack.THEN...we add the technology magic....Position sensors transmit empty Wine slots via a Wifi Connection to a server-side application that notifies you on your mobile device to reorder the wine for that slot.  The mobile app enables you do do exactly that, in real-time.  Never 
forget to stay fully stocked, and NEVER have a ""last bottle"" again.You populate the  Tasting Queue by pre-shopping for a list of wines that you want to try.  When you drink one bottle in your Tasting Queue, the next bottle in your queue gets re-ordered automatically.Here's are all the reasons to Love us:
Available ONLY in the USA
Made in the USA
Programmed in the USA
5 Refillable Wine Position
Patent pending
Wifi enabled
FREE Wine Re-Ordering App is Available for both Apple and Android devices


What People are Saying:
""Now THIS app might be reason enough
for me to get a smarter phone! LOL"" – Mary Hamilton
""I’ve never heard of a better idea!""
– Justin A Turner
""I think that this new product is a
smashing idea."" – Mo’ Vino Journey
Risks & ChallengesOne of the major challenges we face with this project is that we rely on a 3rd party wine distributor to deliver the wine.Since we are not a wine retailer or distribution house ourselves, we need to have and maintain a relationship with a 3rd party partner to do fulfillment for us.  This is why we are programming our app to be ""Product Catalog Agnostic"".  Meaning, since there are dozens of wine distributors in the United States who would LOVE to get in on this, we want our app to be flexible enough to work with any of them.  This way we are less reliant on any one business relationship in order to be successful.

FAQ'SQ: Can I buy EndlessWine if I don't live in the USA?A: We have this crowdfund disabled for users foreign to the USA.  This is mostly because our wine distribution partner only ships to the USA.  As we get distribution partners in other countries, we will open up sales of the Units to those countries.Q:  Is there anything special I need to make EndlessWine work in my house?A:  You need wifi access so that the rack can communicate via the internet with the ordering program.  You need an Android or Apple Smartphone in order to download and install the free companion app. Also, the rack needs to be plugged in.  So you'll need a power outlet near where you plan to keep your rack.
  
Other Ways You Can HelpWe understand that not everyone is in a position to support us financially, but that doesn't mean you can't help!  Help us now by doing one of the following:1.  Tell every single (living) wine drinking human you know about this.  Post it on all the social media outlets you can (use the Indiegogo tools for this).2.  Comment on this page.  Tell us what you think.3.  The next time you have a glass of wine....think about us :)",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Our company, MJ Technology, has a
mission to bring innovative, high quality hardware and software to the market
at an increased value for you the consumer. Our MJ Technology Linux Tablet
series is just one example.</p>
<p>Led by our two company founders, we are
a team of eight developers who have a combined knowledge base of over 50 years
in the mobile technology fields. Our company has already brought one product to
the market, our MJ7HDTV Android HDTV Tuner tablet, so we have the experience of
designing, testing, and bringing to market a complete product. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459357946/uqlgiplpd5nof04vtuiv.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Our plan now is to bring to the
world market a tablet specifically designed and tailored for the Linux
operating system, not only for use by the avid Linux user, but also for the
everyday user, thus bringing the benefits of Linux to people around the world.<br/><br/>Our goal is to make a superior
tablet, both in build quality and hardware performance. This lets consumers
then decide how they can utilize it to their best advantage. Whether that is a
dual boot Windows 10/Open SUSE Linux system for a system administrator needing to
manage multiple servers remotely, or just Open SUSE Linux as your sole operating
system for personal use, we have a tablet that will fit your needs.<br/><br/><p>We are seeking $200,000.00 to bring
this product to final production. We have prototype tablets built and are in
final design testing and debug stages to make ready for production. We have
shown proof that our tablets are real, and will work with multiple Linux
distributions, via the videos we have posted on our Facebook and YouTube
channels during the development stages. </p>
<p>We are ready to go forward with
final production at this point, and are asking for your support, to help us
make the World’s First actual Made-for- Linux x86/x64 Tablet a reality.</p>
<p>We want the user to have the choice
of what operating system and software they want for their given application.
Even if a user would like multiple operating systems on one tablet, such as
Open SUSE Linux, Elementary OS, Linux Mint, Red Hat, Ubuntu ,or Kali Linux, we
can provide the user with the options they need.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459358000/bao752tu9brzdt8xtwxi.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459358016/h2472aitnocyqh0ud60s.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>We will assist them in that respect
by working on making all known viable, popular Linux distributions compatible
with our Linux tablets. It will take time to integrate the different Linux distributions
shown above, as each has unique properties, but that is our end goal here at MJ
Technology LLC.</p>
<p>The first Linux OS to be installed
on our tablet by default will be the latest stable version of<span> Open SUSE</span> Leap or Ubuntu Desktop
16.04 LTS with the most current version of Unity/Mir window manager.</p>
<p>Open SUSE Linux and Ubuntu Linux  is the mostly widely
used and recognized consumer-oriented Linux distributions to date, therefore it
was the most logical choice to start our tablet development with. This allows
the user immediate access to the hundreds of thousands of applications/games
already available on Linux.</p>
<p>Once Ubuntu Touch is to a released
state, we will provide an installable image built for our tablet, with
instructions via our website so the consumer can upgrade/install the OS themselves,
or with our tech support assistance if needed.</p>
<p>Our goal has always been a true
Linux x86/x64 Tablet/PC  with true convergence of use across multiple devices being
the end goal, just as Canonical has shown with Ubuntu Touch, but with the added
bonus of being x86/x64 base with no compatibility issues or need of
porting/redevelopment of software from x86 base to ARM base.</p>
<p>We want to put the power and control
of the computer back in the <i><b>user’s hands</b></i>.</p>

<p><b>Linux provides multiple advantages:</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459358658/tw5qgepekewvqnu1myin.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b>Cost</b> – The most obvious advantage of using Linux is the fact
that it is free, to obtain and use, while Microsoft and other products are
available for a hefty, and sometimes, recurring fee. Microsoft licensed
software is typically only allowed to be installed on a single computer, where
as a Linux distribution and the related software can be installed on any number
of computers, without paying a single dime.<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459358692/omyxgdbcpsuifwga24tq.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b>Security</b> – In line with the costs advantage, the system security
aspects of Linux is much stronger and robust than that of Windows. Why should
you have to spend extra money for anti-virus protection software, taking up CPU
time, memory, and disk space?

<p>The Linux operating system has been
around since the early nineties and has managed to stay secure in the face of
widespread viruses, spyware and adware for all these years. It is modeled after
UNIX software, which is run around the world in multiple business and universities,
and was designed from the beginning with security as a prime function.</p>
<p>While the argument has been made by
some that Linux not being widely used compared to other operating systems is a
reason for there being few known viruses able to attach it, it is more the way
Linux is constructed internally that precludes easy infection and spread of
computer viruses.</p>
<p>The Linux operating system is open
source and if there were a widespread Linux virus released today, there would
be patches released in a matter of hours or a few days, either by ordinary
people that use the operating system or by the distribution maintainers. You
wouldn’t need to wait for a patch from a single company like we do with some
operating systems, that could take weeks or months maybe possibly years in some
cases.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459358727/b447lucckcwpab5zve76.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b>Choice (Freedom)</b> – The power of choice is a great Linux advantage. With
Linux, you have the power to control just about every aspect of the operating
system. Two major features the user can control are the look and feel of their
desktop by way of numerous Window Managers, and the kernel, which controls the
computer hardware. In Windows, you’re either stuck using the boring default
desktop themes, or risk possible corruption or failure by installing a
third-party shell. By controlling the kernel, the user can fine-tune their
system for the way they work, not relying on a generic, one-size fits all usage
pattern.<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459358755/zw2nsvbnofcxu2eqdlzf.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><b>Software</b> - There are so many software choices when it comes to doing
any specific task, be it system admin, multi-media creation, education, you
name it. If you need a specific program, you will probably find one or more
that will work for you. You could search for a basic text editor from multiple
sources at once, and yield hundreds, if not thousands of results.

<p>Regular users and programmers
contribute applications all the time. Sometimes it’s a simple modification or
feature enhancement of an already existing piece of software, sometimes it’s a
brand new application. In addition, software on Linux tends to be packed with
more features and greater usability than software on Windows.</p>
<p>Best of all, the vast majority of
Linux software is free and open source. Not only are you getting the software
at no charge to you, but if you have a problem or an idea for an improvement,
you can make a request to the software developers directly for them to make the
changes. Another option, if you understand the programming language, is you,
the end-user can modify the source code yourself and add more functions or fix
problems. By contributing your changes to the source code back to the Linux
community, you are improving the software for everyone.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1459358803/is9b6xdwlu9brmujobyh.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

<p><b>Risks
&amp; Challenges:</b></p>
<p><b><span>1.<span> 
</span></span></b><b>Failed
past Linux/Ubuntu Projects - </b>We totally understand everyone’s
apprehensions since the Jolla and Ubutab incidents and the fact it has made
everyone very cautious is something we take very seriously here at MJ
Technology.</p>
<p>Jolla just needed to be upfront: the money and development focus was on the
Sailfish OS and the hardware was an afterthought, not a priority for their
campaign here on Indiegogo.</p>
<p>Ubutab on the other hand was an outright scam from the beginning. There were
telling signs: nothing but rendered pictures, outlandish published specs, no
plan stated on how to market or sell the tablet (at a profit) as the hardware
used would cost more than they were asking for it, which meant no future
development and no support after the campaign was
done.</p>
<p>Finally the biggest problem was the people involved in making the campaign did
not have any experience designing or manufacturing a small scale or mass-produced
product, and the campaign was led by a person with no technology field experience
or manufacturing background.</p>
<p>We developed and have brought to market one device already, the MJ7HDTV
Android HDTV Tuner tablet. We are close to 95% or better complete with the new Linux
tablets, and just need funds to make the production of them happen.</p>
<p>The MJ Technology Ubuntu Tablet is based on existing hardware, not something
developed from scratch, like a new processor type or something like that. The
hardware is based on proven components, and we are assembling them using
standard practices.</p>
<p>The unique thing is the OS, which is based on existing software (Ubuntu and
other Linux distro's) we have developed to work with the hardware we have
built. So we are bringing a new product to market, but using proven software
and hardware, plus we have a proven track record of delivering the expected
product like our MJ7HDTV Tablet.</p>
<p>MJ Technology’s project is an “all or nothing” campaign, unlike Ubutab’s
which was a “flex payment” campaign. This meant no matter what happened, they
would get the campaign money whether they could deliver the product or not. </p>
<p>Our development team has the knowledge and the desire to complete this
project. If you look at our progress updates and videos on our Facebook page,
you will see we have had the option to try and raise the money for some time.
We chose not to do this until we had a proven hardware/software configuration finalized
and were ready to take the last steps to move to the production phase. </p>
<p>That time is <u>NOW</u>! Please show your support, whether it is making a
pledge for one of our tablets or just spreading the word to others who might be
interested via social media or word of mouth. 
Let’s make a true Linux tablet, created by avid users, available for
everyone, a reality…</p>

everyday user, thus bringing the benefits of Linux to people around the world.Our goal is to make a superior
tablet, both in build quality and hardware performance. This lets consumers
then decide how they can utilize it to their best advantage. Whether that is a
dual boot Windows 10/Open SUSE Linux system for a system administrator needing to
manage multiple servers remotely, or just Open SUSE Linux as your sole operating
system for personal use, we have a tablet that will fit your needs.We are seeking $200,000.00 to bring
this product to final production. We have prototype tablets built and are in
final design testing and debug stages to make ready for production. We have
shown proof that our tablets are real, and will work with multiple Linux
distributions, via the videos we have posted on our Facebook and YouTube
channels during the development stages. 
We are ready to go forward with
final production at this point, and are asking for your support, to help us
make the World’s First actual Made-for- Linux x86/x64 Tablet a reality.
We want the user to have the choice
of what operating system and software they want for their given application.
Even if a user would like multiple operating systems on one tablet, such as
Open SUSE Linux, Elementary OS, Linux Mint, Red Hat, Ubuntu ,or Kali Linux, we
can provide the user with the options they need.
We will assist them in that respect
by working on making all known viable, popular Linux distributions compatible
with our Linux tablets. It will take time to integrate the different Linux distributions
shown above, as each has unique properties, but that is our end goal here at MJ
Technology LLC.
The first Linux OS to be installed
on our tablet by default will be the latest stable version of Open SUSE Leap or Ubuntu Desktop
16.04 LTS with the most current version of Unity/Mir window manager.
Open SUSE Linux and Ubuntu Linux  is the mostly widely
used and recognized consumer-oriented Linux distributions to date, therefore it
was the most logical choice to start our tablet development with. This allows
the user immediate access to the hundreds of thousands of applications/games
already available on Linux.
Once Ubuntu Touch is to a released
state, we will provide an installable image built for our tablet, with
instructions via our website so the consumer can upgrade/install the OS themselves,
or with our tech support assistance if needed.
Our goal has always been a true
Linux x86/x64 Tablet/PC  with true convergence of use across multiple devices being
the end goal, just as Canonical has shown with Ubuntu Touch, but with the added
bonus of being x86/x64 base with no compatibility issues or need of
porting/redevelopment of software from x86 base to ARM base.
We want to put the power and control
of the computer back in the user’s hands.

MJ
Technology presents our ""Warrior"" series of Tablets. Pledge for one
today here on IndieGoGo and join ""The Way of the Enlightened
Warrior."" Please take a moment to review the specifications below of each model
in our Tablet series, and begin your journey on the enlightened path.After hearing concerns expressed by
some people about the initial pricing of the tablets with the higher
performance level hardware, we have responded quickly to them and have come up
with an additional mid-range model.

While providing mid-range level
hardware, it will still provide an excellent user experience. It comes with the
same case/multiple ports/display/battery and will function as just well as our
other models for user not requiring the stronger performing hardware.
Below is what the 8.9 inch (on left)
and 10.1 inch (on right) models will look like, each model coming with two
available color options, matte black or a brushed aluminum finish. See our
website for the optional matching tablet that provides for a true 2-in-1 Ultrabook
experience.
Here is a comparison of
specifications between our MJ Technology Ubuntu Tablet and the BQ M10 Ubuntu
Touch Tablet. The BQ M10 will only run Ubuntu Touch and Touch related software
natively, as it uses an ARM processor. For better view and comparison to other tablets like Microsoft Surface Pro 4 and Dell Venue 8 Pro Please click on the link just below.Click Here for Comparison Sheets to compare our tablets to others tablets...

This precludes it from running
Ubuntu Desktop, or any other x86/x64 based distribution of Linux natively therefore an emulation API will have to be used. You can be
the judge, but we feel we have surpassed the BQ M10 with our tablet design that
is a true multi-use system from the start. Some people will ask  “What does using Linux as your operating system provide
you, the user, over other operating systems”?
Linux provides multiple advantages:Cost – The most obvious advantage of using Linux is the fact
that it is free, to obtain and use, while Microsoft and other products are
available for a hefty, and sometimes, recurring fee. Microsoft licensed
software is typically only allowed to be installed on a single computer, where
as a Linux distribution and the related software can be installed on any number
of computers, without paying a single dime.Security – In line with the costs advantage, the system security
aspects of Linux is much stronger and robust than that of Windows. Why should
you have to spend extra money for anti-virus protection software, taking up CPU
time, memory, and disk space?

The Linux operating system has been
around since the early nineties and has managed to stay secure in the face of
widespread viruses, spyware and adware for all these years. It is modeled after
UNIX software, which is run around the world in multiple business and universities,
and was designed from the beginning with security as a prime function.
While the argument has been made by
some that Linux not being widely used compared to other operating systems is a
reason for there being few known viruses able to attach it, it is more the way
Linux is constructed internally that precludes easy infection and spread of
computer viruses.
The Linux operating system is open
source and if there were a widespread Linux virus released today, there would
be patches released in a matter of hours or a few days, either by ordinary
people that use the operating system or by the distribution maintainers. You
wouldn’t need to wait for a patch from a single company like we do with some
operating systems, that could take weeks or months maybe possibly years in some
cases.Choice (Freedom) – The power of choice is a great Linux advantage. With
Linux, you have the power to control just about every aspect of the operating
system. Two major features the user can control are the look and feel of their
desktop by way of numerous Window Managers, and the kernel, which controls the
computer hardware. In Windows, you’re either stuck using the boring default
desktop themes, or risk possible corruption or failure by installing a
third-party shell. By controlling the kernel, the user can fine-tune their
system for the way they work, not relying on a generic, one-size fits all usage
pattern.Software - There are so many software choices when it comes to doing
any specific task, be it system admin, multi-media creation, education, you
name it. If you need a specific program, you will probably find one or more
that will work for you. You could search for a basic text editor from multiple
sources at once, and yield hundreds, if not thousands of results.

Regular users and programmers
contribute applications all the time. Sometimes it’s a simple modification or
feature enhancement of an already existing piece of software, sometimes it’s a
brand new application. In addition, software on Linux tends to be packed with
more features and greater usability than software on Windows.
Best of all, the vast majority of
Linux software is free and open source. Not only are you getting the software
at no charge to you, but if you have a problem or an idea for an improvement,
you can make a request to the software developers directly for them to make the
changes. Another option, if you understand the programming language, is you,
the end-user can modify the source code yourself and add more functions or fix
problems. By contributing your changes to the source code back to the Linux
community, you are improving the software for everyone.
What more could you, the user, ask
for?
In the coming days, we will be
posting some videos in Comments section and Gallery explaining our vision for our tablets, plus showing some
working preview examples of what is to come in the next few months when the
tablets are available for delivery.
See our Facebook page as we will be
posting continuing updates on the final testing and development progress.                    https://www.facebook.com/MJ-Technology-LLC-576568032444682/https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_bXAqtExCIQSsozIBwJLbABelow are some News/Media outlets
that have referenced our upcoming tablet release: You can also do a search online to
find out about our Ubuntu Tablet, just do a keyword search ""MJ Technology
Ubuntu"".

Please join our vision, and support
our work, as we strive toward providing the best possible Linux experience for
all consumers, with a portable, powerful, and useful tablet now, and more
devices in the future.
Risks
& Challenges:
1. 
Failed
past Linux/Ubuntu Projects - We totally understand everyone’s
apprehensions since the Jolla and Ubutab incidents and the fact it has made
everyone very cautious is something we take very seriously here at MJ
Technology.
Jolla just needed to be upfront: the money and development focus was on the
Sailfish OS and the hardware was an afterthought, not a priority for their
campaign here on Indiegogo.
Ubutab on the other hand was an outright scam from the beginning. There were
telling signs: nothing but rendered pictures, outlandish published specs, no
plan stated on how to market or sell the tablet (at a profit) as the hardware
used would cost more than they were asking for it, which meant no future
development and no support after the campaign was
done.
Finally the biggest problem was the people involved in making the campaign did
not have any experience designing or manufacturing a small scale or mass-produced
product, and the campaign was led by a person with no technology field experience
or manufacturing background.
We developed and have brought to market one device already, the MJ7HDTV
Android HDTV Tuner tablet. We are close to 95% or better complete with the new Linux
tablets, and just need funds to make the production of them happen.
The MJ Technology Ubuntu Tablet is based on existing hardware, not something
developed from scratch, like a new processor type or something like that. The
hardware is based on proven components, and we are assembling them using
standard practices.
The unique thing is the OS, which is based on existing software (Ubuntu and
other Linux distro's) we have developed to work with the hardware we have
built. So we are bringing a new product to market, but using proven software
and hardware, plus we have a proven track record of delivering the expected
product like our MJ7HDTV Tablet.
MJ Technology’s project is an “all or nothing” campaign, unlike Ubutab’s
which was a “flex payment” campaign. This meant no matter what happened, they
would get the campaign money whether they could deliver the product or not. 
Our development team has the knowledge and the desire to complete this
project. If you look at our progress updates and videos on our Facebook page,
you will see we have had the option to try and raise the money for some time.
We chose not to do this until we had a proven hardware/software configuration finalized
and were ready to take the last steps to move to the production phase. 
That time is NOW! Please show your support, whether it is making a
pledge for one of our tablets or just spreading the word to others who might be
interested via social media or word of mouth. 
Let’s make a true Linux tablet, created by avid users, available for
everyone, a reality…
2. 
Can we
produce the tablet as described? - We have worked on a similar device, our MJ7HDTV Tablet since August 2014
and released it to market in October 2015. This is why we have a complete
confidence in our ability to successfully deliver this product. 
We could really use your comments, suggestions, concerns about our 
Ubuntu Tablet project the MJ Technology Warrior Tablet Series. Please 
e-mail us @  comments@mj-technology.com  So we can address any 
and all concerns you might have about project we have not addressed as 
of yet with videos, pictures, and our mission statment here on IndieGoGo.We have an experienced team, very
skilled both with hardware and software integration. We are absolutely
confident that we can ship this Ubuntu Linux Tablet according to our projected timeline.  We have already completed and tested several
models of the prototype using the old Intel’s Bay Trail Processor when we first
started development and now with the Intel Cherry Trail processor. 
This has helped us to not only gain
thorough, component-specific knowledge to aid in development and design of this
tablet, but has allowed us to build solid and professional relationships with
all of the component suppliers involved in the future production process.
We understand that there are a few risks associated
with the launch of a brand new technology product into the world market, but we
are convinced that with our design, these are minimal and manageable. We
already have in our hands a complete, functioning product, and we are ready to
mass-produce it for you the consumer. 
We believe in a transparent project management
approach, thus we have chosen to keep all our backers informed on a regular
basis about the progress made during the production phase, just as we have
during the hardware/software development phase, through our Facebook page.  https://www.facebook.com/MJ-Technology-LLC-576568032444682/Mark Jun - Co-founder of MJ Technology the

<p>SwipeBoard is an idea that allows you to look at the text inputting from a different angle. It solves a number of issues that regular software keyboard has:</p>
<p>·      To fit the screen, key buttons should be small enough</p>
<p>·      Keyboard takes a large part of the screen</p>
<p>·      You make mistakes pretty often</p>

<h3>The Idea</h3>
<p>To understand the idea, it is better to watch the video, but in short, instead of making you tap key buttons on a regular software keyboard, SwipeBoard matches a swipe direction over the screen with a particular letter. As a result, you need to allocate smaller part of a screen, user doesn’t have to be as accurate (hence, typing speed increases), eye-free text inputting is supported (so people with eye-disabilities can use it as well).</p>
<p>The biggest power of the idea is that any part of touch surface can become a keyboard for you, starting from Apple Watch, ending with a touch surface on a steering wheel of your car (should be an interesting case with the autopilot in Tesla, right?).</p>

<h3>Why do we need money?</h3>
<p>Currently, we have pretty good prototypes for Android and iOS that implement the idea. Unfortunately, as we have main jobs, we can only work on the project in our personal time that makes development rather slow.</p>
<p>Here is what we need to complete a production ready applications:</p>
<p>·      Create configuration interface, so everybody can configure languages, global actions (like language switch, etc.), special characters layout, enable keyboard on a system level, create custom gestures, etc.</p>
<p>·      We need the design for both the Board (colors, fonts) and configuration interface</p>
<p>·      Implement autocorrection (T9) and autosuggestion services. Without these features, nobody will use SwipeBoard instead of a regular software keyboard. This was tested on our friends</p>
<p>·      Create a training guide, to make the moving to the SwipeBoard smooth and comfortable.</p>
<p>·      Improve the algorithm of recognizing swipes, as currently it is a little bit hard to get used to the app in the beginning.</p>
<p>·      We plan to work on eye-disabled people support version of the app as well, but UAT Members (see below) should prioritize this point first.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>Future on the wrist</h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Watches that are not
only about keeping time turned into a usual part of our everyday environment
only recently. However, this innovation especially hit plenty of people
pursuing active lifestyles. One of the most populous and rapidly growing
communities are cyclists of numerous varieties, like trail riding and mountain
biking, road training and regular everyday commuting. People like us and our
friends. We ride any terrain, under any conditions, in any weather.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">In many cases,
companies that manufacture smart watches</span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> and HRM sport watches rightfully
concentrate their effort on developing the core product and pay significantly
less attention to the option of easy and secure mounting of the watch on the
bicycle handlebar, which a lot of riders would enjoy. As a result, there is either
no holder at all or a holder too unhandy for everyday use.</span><br/>
</div>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<h3>Our Idea</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">We decided to
address the issue</span><span style=""font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> by developing the necessary fixture from scratch instead of augmenting
the already available designs. We strove for lightweight, simplicity and ease of
use, flexibility and integrity, all the while keeping the price affordable and
manufacturing eco-friendly.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span></p>

<br/><p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span></p>
<h3>Path to perfection</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">After several months
of field testing and tweaking, we came up with the multi-purpose design, in
which every detail is functionally loaded. 
The holder’s base is a precision laser cut strip of  polypropylene – widely available and non-toxic plastic, both affordable and highly durable. The silicone coating of the part that
contacts the handlebar prevents skidding in any conditions and the horizontal lock
keeps the watch within sight no matter how heavy the jolting. The high-performance
hook and loop fastener keeps the holder securely fixed in place. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our holder is </span><b>safe for your watch</b><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">: it does not create any extra load to straps or pins when used according to instructions, mainly because, unlike other holders, it does not require strong tightening and significantly reduces the risk of the watchstrap unbuckling by accident.<br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464208949/final1_t3csgl.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;""></span></p>
<h3>One size fits all?</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The holder’s
dimensions and parameters fit many existent models of sports watches. The holder was developed and tested with Pebble smart watches and with popular wrist-worn HRMs
manufactured by Sigma, Garmin and Polar. Its resilient fastening provides the watch with additional protection by absorbing most of the impact energy, and its wide
frontal part shields it from water and mud. The holder can be securely attached
at any place on the handlebar of the mountain bike or on the bar tape of the road
bike – all it takes is the width of two inches! Besides the main, most
versatile model, we have also developed variations for compact watches like
Sigma PC3 series and tough chronometers like Garmin Fenix. You can make your ride even more advantageous by using apps like Ventoo or Strava and use smart watch to complement your bike computer or completely replace it, as you see fit.</span></p>

<h3>On your arm, bike, desk</h3>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">And a little special extra!
At home, in your office or at the
gym, the holder turns into a handy desktop watch stand with an adjustable
viewing angle. Are you doing popular plank or squats exercise every day and worried about your
heart rate? Place your HRM watch in front of you and enjoy the results!</span></p>

<div><p style=""text-align: center;""><b>Smartwatch
Anywhere. Striving for Comfort</b></p></div>
<p></p>
<p></p>
</div></div>","Future on the wrist
Watches that are not
only about keeping time turned into a usual part of our everyday environment
only recently. However, this innovation especially hit plenty of people
pursuing active lifestyles. One of the most populous and rapidly growing
communities are cyclists of numerous varieties, like trail riding and mountain
biking, road training and regular everyday commuting. People like us and our
friends. We ride any terrain, under any conditions, in any weather.


The Problem

In many cases,
companies that manufacture smart watches and HRM sport watches rightfully
concentrate their effort on developing the core product and pay significantly
less attention to the option of easy and secure mounting of the watch on the
bicycle handlebar, which a lot of riders would enjoy. As a result, there is either
no holder at all or a holder too unhandy for everyday use.



Our Idea

We decided to
address the issue by developing the necessary fixture from scratch instead of augmenting
the already available designs. We strove for lightweight, simplicity and ease of
use, flexibility and integrity, all the while keeping the price affordable and
manufacturing eco-friendly.




Path to perfection

After several months
of field testing and tweaking, we came up with the multi-purpose design, in
which every detail is functionally loaded. 
The holder’s base is a precision laser cut strip of  polypropylene – widely available and non-toxic plastic, both affordable and highly durable. The silicone coating of the part that
contacts the handlebar prevents skidding in any conditions and the horizontal lock
keeps the watch within sight no matter how heavy the jolting. The high-performance
hook and loop fastener keeps the holder securely fixed in place. 
Our holder is safe for your watch: it does not create any extra load to straps or pins when used according to instructions, mainly because, unlike other holders, it does not require strong tightening and significantly reduces the risk of the watchstrap unbuckling by accident.





One size fits all?

The holder’s
dimensions and parameters fit many existent models of sports watches. The holder was developed and tested with Pebble smart watches and with popular wrist-worn HRMs
manufactured by Sigma, Garmin and Polar. Its resilient fastening provides the watch with additional protection by absorbing most of the impact energy, and its wide
frontal part shields it from water and mud. The holder can be securely attached
at any place on the handlebar of the mountain bike or on the bar tape of the road
bike – all it takes is the width of two inches! Besides the main, most
versatile model, we have also developed variations for compact watches like
Sigma PC3 series and tough chronometers like Garmin Fenix. You can make your ride even more advantageous by using apps like Ventoo or Strava and use smart watch to complement your bike computer or completely replace it, as you see fit.





On your arm, bike, desk

And a little special extra!
At home, in your office or at the
gym, the holder turns into a handy desktop watch stand with an adjustable
viewing angle. Are you doing popular plank or squats exercise every day and worried about your
heart rate? Place your HRM watch in front of you and enjoy the results!




Why your contribution is important

Currently, we are only manufacturing Smartwatch Anywhere Holders for friends and colleagues who help us with testing so the production cost per item is quite high. With additional funding, we will improve our product and spend the money wisely to satisfy all our contributors without delay:
 
Order a big batch of source polypropylene sheets of the optimal size, density and thickness. Minimize the laser cut bills due to a large manufacturing volume and adjust cut quality for our product. Order custom size hook and loop fasteners for better fixing.
Improve the silicone coating durability.
Add a bit of nice printing on the holder's surface.


If we secure the necessary funding, we will move forward and offer two-layer models with improved usability in a variety of colors and textures soon after the first wave of manufacturing and shipping to customers!


Risks and challenges


We take our project very seriously: we are confident that we will be able to manufacture and ship our holders on time to all of our contributors. 


We will keep you updated about Smartwatch Anywhere Holders development and your feedback will help us provide you a more sound product.
We understand the simplicity of our idea and probably copies and fakes will appear soon so we did everything possible to protect your investments:  Each holder has a unique serial number to prevent counterfeiting. We have applied for a patent in our country.
We are serious about legal protection against product copies. 










Perks



Classic Holder is a universal one. It fits virtually any watch with a plastic, rubber, resin, leather or similar strap up to one inch (25 mm) in width. When used as a handlebar holder, it safely and reliably keeps any watch in place with weight up to two ounces (50 g) regardless of the size of the watch.



Slim Holder is a lightweight version designed for narrow or small watches with weight up to 40 grams and up to a one-inch wide strap. Ideal as an invisible tabletop stand for your favorite watch.



Tough Holder is a reinforced version created for improved durability in extreme conditions. It is able to carry an up to 90 g watch with a 30-mm wide strap. Virtually indestructible when used as a desktop stand. Casio-style double part metal straps should be used with caution because of their heavy weight.

Kodiola is Easier than other Kodi Boxes
Just plug in the device, connect it to a TV, and you are ready to start using Kodi like always! No installing APKs or signing up for Amazon subscriptions required.
Automatic Updates
            
Kodiola will automatically update Kodi and the Linux OS it runs on so you always have the latest and most secure software running, without having to manually update every few months.
Sync Configuration and Media Collection
Kodiola boxes sync configurations with each other, so once you configure your settings and repos, it is synced across all the Kodiola boxes and TVs in your home. One box functions as the ""guru"" which pushes settings to the other ""follower"" boxes.

Once devices are connected together, unify the media on all Kodiola devices and access your complete aggregated library from all of the other Kodiola boxes in your home!
 
Kodiola is Smarter than other Kodi Boxes
In addition to the features that make Kodiola easier to use, there are smart features in Kodiola that help you get the most out of this next generation Kodi box.

We live in the World where environment is taken for granted, where woods are just some large pile of plants that produce oxygen and looks nice. People are less considerate about the Earth than never before. We want to change that! Introducing iPallet4.me - a tablet cover made from used transport pallets. Personal story: when I bought my first tablet, I didn't want to buy some rubber/plastic case for it. Eventually I did, but only to protect the device from scratching. Since I was in pallet crafting as a hobby woodworker, I thought: ""It will be cool to produce wooden case from pallet wood"".At first, I thought It can't be done.  But wait, there's more!  

 
 Others about us   Featured in: 1001pallets - Recycled Pallet Tablet Case       Why only these types of tablets? Thanks for asking. There are  tremendous types of tablets out there on the market.  We are producing only for the best selling models according to our research and intuition. With the development of a single case for a single tablet requiring a large quantity of our limited resources, the necessity to be strategically selective is paramount. Scratch protection with soft, eco friendly leather. Choose your finish : natural, burned, black. We'll get in touch after you became ""the backer"".   Your logo engraved? No problem. Handcrafted juta bags for shipping.    Side PerksPallet coastersEvery piece of wood is valuable. Therefore, nothing is left unused. Pallet coaster are made from the rest of the wood during production process. T-Shirt Who doesn't like T-shirts?   About the projectThis is a pallet, okay? Lots of dirty, old, pallets. Used pallets are usually thrown away like that.  And this is a tablet.Nice, isn't it. The process 1. Sketching  2. Rendering

</p>
<p>PureCase is the first antibacterial case AND glass screen that protects you from germs and your iPhone (5/5S and 6) from
drops and scratches. Both, the durable casing and ultra-thin glass screen protector have been enriched with microsilver particles, which are naturally antibacterial.</p>

</h1>
<p>Did you know that our phones often have fecal
bacteria, E.coli and other pathogens on them? We felt that having a clean phone
should be like washing hands or having regular showers – normal. Of course there are also a lot of your own, healthy skin bacteria on your phone but it's those harmful pathogens that cause illnesses and that we want to contain. And not to
mention that keeping personal items clean could also help you, your family, your kids or people with weak immune systems fight of nasty colds that go round school or circulate around the subway with all the sneezing folks.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h1>Dropping, breaking, scratching... </h1>
<p>But the case and glass screen aren’t just for
germaphobes, health workers or frequent travellers, the focus is very much also
on functionality and design. Our smartphone is one of the most used item each day, we activate it
more than 150 times. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1268214/files/20150304102204-PureCase_Prezi_02Scratchbild_250215_CH.jpg?1425493324"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We don’t
just take our phones everywhere including bathrooms, we drop them while out
jogging or throw them in our handbags or pockets with keys in. We give them to our kids and often they end up skidding over sidewalks
or other unpleasant surfaces. The result: broken screens, scratched up cases
and expensive repairs (if at all possible). Ouch. Totally
unnecessary heart-ache when this is so easily avoided with PureCase &amp; Screen at a fraction of the cost. PureCase will safe us clumsy multi-taskers
from misery, </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1268217/files/20150304102236-PureCase_Prezi_03Dropbild_250215_CH.jpg?1425493356"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Verena, one of our friends immediately
put one of our prototypes to the test: „I accidently dropped my brand new
iPhone 6 while out for a run. I’d had it for 3 days and luckily put on the case
and glass screen the day before. The glass broke but my iPhone screen didn’t.
Already worth every cent.“</p>
<h1>Air bubbles good-bye</h1>
<p>Remember those annoying air bubbles from cling film-like plastic screen protectors? You can say good-bye to those. The PureCase glass screen is extremely thin, really easy to apply and feels just like the original
glass underneath. It is equally touch sensitive as your iPhone's touch screen underneath and you won’t even notice it's there. It not only gives your smartphone an extra layer of protection from drops and scratches but is of course also antibacterial - because your touch screen is where it matters most!</p>

<p></p>
<h1>Simple, stylish, state of the art</h1>
<p>PureCase puts the focus on the
classy gadget itself, in this case the iPhone 5/5S and 6. It doesn't distract
from the precious Apple design, which is what people are willing to spend
hundreds of dollars on. That’s why both case and glass screen protector are available in
transparent and anthracite / graphite only. State of the art polyurethane and tempered glass both enriched with micro silver technology give you that extra layer of protection.</p>

<h1>Who we are</h1>
<p>We are a bunch of good friends (3 guys, 1 girl) centered around our „mastermind“ Moritz. We are from
Munich in Germany (Oktoberfest, rings a bell?) and Salzburg in Austria (if
Sound of Music and Mozart mean anything to you...). We’ve always wanted to do
something together, which we started discussing at various nights out over our
favourite drink gin &amp; tonic. Go figure. And because we have always been
very entrepreneurial minded, Moritz eventually came up with the idea for
PureCase. Sadly the occasion wasn't the happiest: a close friend was diagnosed with cancer and had to undergo chemotherapy, which really weakens the immune system. After learning about the amount of germs on our smartphones and considering how often we touch them - PureCase was born. Ever since we’ve been working our butts off, and can’t look at subway
rails, door knobs or our iPhones the same way. You can learn more about each team member further below. </p>

<h1>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h1>
<p>We’ve invested our initial funds and a lot of
time in testing the casing, glass screen and antibacterial micro silver
coating. All that’s now ready for tooling and mass production. We  now have super cool prototypes but to
order the first batch of products we need your help.</p>
<h1>Perks</h1>
<p>We’ve got some special perks for you in store.
Besides our „Early Birds“ at 30% discount for our first 100 supporters, we’ve
also included some travel perks for our high rollers. A week at an exclusive apartment in Salzburg or Vienna – how about making
the most of these once in a lifetime opportunities? We are excited to meet you.</p>

<h1><br/></h1><h1>FAQs</h1>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>PURCHASING &amp; SHIPPING</b></p>
<p><b>How do I choose my iPhone model and PureCase color?</b></p>
<p>Once you have purchased a perk, go to <a href=""http://www.purecase.net/color"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.purecase.net/color</a> enter the email address that you registered for Indiegogo and select your model and color. We can’t process or ship your order until you have finished the order process by selecting both.</p>
<p><b>When will I receive my PureCase?</b></p>
<p>Our aim is to start delivering soon after the campaign finishes (mid June). However please be patient with us as we may have to make unforseen changes, tweeks and optimizations to the first batch of production.</p><p><b>Where do you ship to?</b></p><p>Worldwide.</p>
<p><b>Is shipping included?</b></p><p>Shipping is included for countries of the European Union, United States and Canada. All other countries please purchase the ""Rest of the world shipping"" perk of $ 5 on top of your regular perk.</p><p></p><p><b>Is PureCase available for Samsung?</b></p><p>Unfortunately the production tools for each type of case are incredibly expensive, which is why we are crowdfunding. We are starting with the case and glass screen for the iPhone 5/5S and 6 but as soon as we have enough funds we will aim to produce PureCase for Samsung too. If you want to stay up to date and get notified, subsribe to our newsletter on <a href=""http://www.purecase.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.purecase.net</a> </p>
<p><b>Is there a warranty for PureCase &amp; Screen?</b></p>
<p>We have done many tests and had great results when phones were dropped. Most times there was not a scratch on either PureCase &amp; Screen or the phone underneath. Sometimes the PureCase glass screen protector broke but the iPhone screen was completely unharmed. So with proper use and care of your PureCase &amp; Screen you will get an added layer of protection for your smartphone. However we can not be held responsible or liable for any damage to your phone in any shape or form (e.g. if it is dropped etc.).</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>PURECASE – CASE AND GLASS SCREEN</b></p>
<p><b>What material is the case made of?</b></p>
<p>It is synthetic, polyurethane to be more precise.</p>
<p><b>Can I attach the glass cover myself?</b></p>
<p>Of course you can. The cover comes with an alcoholic cleaning cloth and a micro-fabric cloth to remove dirt, stains and bacteria before you easily attach the glass screen to your iPhone display.</p>
<p><b>How stable is the glass screen?</b></p><p>The screen is made of glass, which means that if you drop your phone on a hard floor, the glass may break. However with the added layer of protection, your phone screen is much less likely to break.</p>
<p><b>Does the glass screen affect the touch functionality of my iPhone?</b></p><p>Not all all. The touch screen works exactly the same. In fact, it makes the screen feel even smoother.</p>
<p><b>Is the glass cover visible?</b></p><p>When you look really closely you might see the edges oft the glass cover. Overall, it is almost invisible and you won’t even feel it. </p>
<p><b>Is PureCase waterproof?</b></p><p>No. As with most electronic devices, you should keep your phone away from water, with or without PureCase &amp; Screen. Even though the case has protective covers for openings such as the head phone jack, water might still get in.</p>
<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>BACTERIA PROTECTION</b></p><p><b>How long will the antibacterial effect last?</b></p><p>The antibacterial effect has a life time of 40 years.</p>
<p><b>How does the protection work?</b></p><p>PureCase uses the highly effective micro silver technology. It is odorless and transparent, so you wont even notice it is there. </p>
<p><b>Will my iPhone be completely free from bacteria?</b></p><p>The micro silver technology has a strong antibacterial impact. It is even effective against bacteria like MRSA, E-Coli or EHEC. It also eliminates odors created by bacteria. Although it is almost impossible to make anything completely free of bacteria, PureCase will SIGNIFICANTLY reduce the number of bacteria on your phone.</p>

<p></p></div>","Perfect if you care about your health and protecting your precious iPhoneWe thought holding something to your mouth, ears and face that is dirtier than a toilet seat, a rail on public transport, door handles or the soles of your shoes is a little... gross. Fact is, on average, all these items are cleaner than your smartphone.  
   



Antibacterial case & glass screen



PureCase is the first antibacterial case AND glass screen that protects you from germs and your iPhone (5/5S and 6) from
drops and scratches. Both, the durable casing and ultra-thin glass screen protector have been enriched with microsilver particles, which are naturally antibacterial.








Health & hygiene

Did you know that our phones often have fecal
bacteria, E.coli and other pathogens on them? We felt that having a clean phone
should be like washing hands or having regular showers – normal. Of course there are also a lot of your own, healthy skin bacteria on your phone but it's those harmful pathogens that cause illnesses and that we want to contain. And not to
mention that keeping personal items clean could also help you, your family, your kids or people with weak immune systems fight of nasty colds that go round school or circulate around the subway with all the sneezing folks.



Dropping, breaking, scratching... 
But the case and glass screen aren’t just for
germaphobes, health workers or frequent travellers, the focus is very much also
on functionality and design. Our smartphone is one of the most used item each day, we activate it
more than 150 times. 

We don’t
just take our phones everywhere including bathrooms, we drop them while out
jogging or throw them in our handbags or pockets with keys in. We give them to our kids and often they end up skidding over sidewalks
or other unpleasant surfaces. The result: broken screens, scratched up cases
and expensive repairs (if at all possible). Ouch. Totally
unnecessary heart-ache when this is so easily avoided with PureCase & Screen at a fraction of the cost. PureCase will safe us clumsy multi-taskers
from misery, 

Verena, one of our friends immediately
put one of our prototypes to the test: „I accidently dropped my brand new
iPhone 6 while out for a run. I’d had it for 3 days and luckily put on the case
and glass screen the day before. The glass broke but my iPhone screen didn’t.
Already worth every cent.“
Air bubbles good-bye
Remember those annoying air bubbles from cling film-like plastic screen protectors? You can say good-bye to those. The PureCase glass screen is extremely thin, really easy to apply and feels just like the original
glass underneath. It is equally touch sensitive as your iPhone's touch screen underneath and you won’t even notice it's there. It not only gives your smartphone an extra layer of protection from drops and scratches but is of course also antibacterial - because your touch screen is where it matters most!





Simple, stylish, state of the art
PureCase puts the focus on the
classy gadget itself, in this case the iPhone 5/5S and 6. It doesn't distract
from the precious Apple design, which is what people are willing to spend
hundreds of dollars on. That’s why both case and glass screen protector are available in
transparent and anthracite / graphite only. State of the art polyurethane and tempered glass both enriched with micro silver technology give you that extra layer of protection.

Who we are
We are a bunch of good friends (3 guys, 1 girl) centered around our „mastermind“ Moritz. We are from
Munich in Germany (Oktoberfest, rings a bell?) and Salzburg in Austria (if
Sound of Music and Mozart mean anything to you...). We’ve always wanted to do
something together, which we started discussing at various nights out over our
favourite drink gin & tonic. Go figure. And because we have always been
very entrepreneurial minded, Moritz eventually came up with the idea for
PureCase. Sadly the occasion wasn't the happiest: a close friend was diagnosed with cancer and had to undergo chemotherapy, which really weakens the immune system. After learning about the amount of germs on our smartphones and considering how often we touch them - PureCase was born. Ever since we’ve been working our butts off, and can’t look at subway
rails, door knobs or our iPhones the same way. You can learn more about each team member further below. 

Basti (top left), Kurt (top middle) and Verena (bottom left) are good friends who helped us with the video shoot and other grass-root stuff. The PureCase team: Alexis (top right), Moritz (bottom middle) and Martin (bottom right) - the fourth member, Catherine, unfortunately isn't in the photo.
What We Need & What You Get
We’ve invested our initial funds and a lot of
time in testing the casing, glass screen and antibacterial micro silver
coating. All that’s now ready for tooling and mass production. We  now have super cool prototypes but to
order the first batch of products we need your help.
Perks
We’ve got some special perks for you in store.
Besides our „Early Birds“ at 30% discount for our first 100 supporters, we’ve
also included some travel perks for our high rollers. A week at an exclusive apartment in Salzburg or Vienna – how about making
the most of these once in a lifetime opportunities? We are excited to meet you.

with a vivid eye for detail, patience and stamina that will knock out a bull on steroids.
Catherine
Catherine sees the bigger picture. Never shy
of a vision to change the world she can pull together a mind blowing strategy
from a few notes on a piece of napkin and get started on exciting the world about
it. PR, marketing and content are her home turf.
The vision (for the future)
""We want to create something that not only aids everyday personal hygiene but also protects people's precious high-tech investments, without distracting from the beautifully designed product underneath."" Which is why PureCase & Screen is just the first product... let's see what's next. We would also like to offer PureCase for Samsung owners and we will be looking into other gadgets like iPads/tablets too. Another idea would be to focus on applications in the health industry like in hospitals or pharmacies to protect people with weak immune systems. We'd love to hear your thoughts and ideas.

FAQs
PURCHASING & SHIPPING
How do I choose my iPhone model and PureCase color?
Once you have purchased a perk, go to www.purecase.net/color enter the email address that you registered for Indiegogo and select your model and color. We can’t process or ship your order until you have finished the order process by selecting both.
When will I receive my PureCase?
Our aim is to start delivering soon after the campaign finishes (mid June). However please be patient with us as we may have to make unforseen changes, tweeks and optimizations to the first batch of production.Where do you ship to?Worldwide.
Is shipping included?Shipping is included for countries of the European Union, United States and Canada. All other countries please purchase the ""Rest of the world shipping"" perk of $ 5 on top of your regular perk.Is PureCase available for Samsung?Unfortunately the production tools for each type of case are incredibly expensive, which is why we are crowdfunding. We are starting with the case and glass screen for the iPhone 5/5S and 6 but as soon as we have enough funds we will aim to produce PureCase for Samsung too. If you want to stay up to date and get notified, subsribe to our newsletter on www.purecase.net 
Is there a warranty for PureCase & Screen?
We have done many tests and had great results when phones were dropped. Most times there was not a scratch on either PureCase & Screen or the phone underneath. Sometimes the PureCase glass screen protector broke but the iPhone screen was completely unharmed. So with proper use and care of your PureCase & Screen you will get an added layer of protection for your smartphone. However we can not be held responsible or liable for any damage to your phone in any shape or form (e.g. if it is dropped etc.).
PURECASE – CASE AND GLASS SCREEN
What material is the case made of?
It is synthetic, polyurethane to be more precise.
Can I attach the glass cover myself?
Of course you can. The cover comes with an alcoholic cleaning cloth and a micro-fabric cloth to remove dirt, stains and bacteria before you easily attach the glass screen to your iPhone display.
How stable is the glass screen?The screen is made of glass, which means that if you drop your phone on a hard floor, the glass may break. However with the added layer of protection, your phone screen is much less likely to break.
Does the glass screen affect the touch functionality of my iPhone?Not all all. The touch screen works exactly the same. In fact, it makes the screen feel even smoother.
Is the glass cover visible?When you look really closely you might see the edges oft the glass cover. Overall, it is almost invisible and you won’t even feel it. 
Is PureCase waterproof?No. As with most electronic devices, you should keep your phone away from water, with or without PureCase & Screen. Even though the case has protective covers for openings such as the head phone jack, water might still get in.
BACTERIA PROTECTIONHow long will the antibacterial effect last?The antibacterial effect has a life time of 40 years.
How does the protection work?PureCase uses the highly effective micro silver technology. It is odorless and transparent, so you wont even notice it is there. 
Will my iPhone be completely free from bacteria?The micro silver technology has a strong antibacterial impact. It is even effective against bacteria like MRSA, E-Coli or EHEC. It also eliminates odors created by bacteria. Although it is almost impossible to make anything completely free of bacteria, PureCase will SIGNIFICANTLY reduce the number of bacteria on your phone.
Will I never get sick again?Unfortunately no one can guarantee you to never get sick again. What PureCase does is to limit the amount of bacteria you transfer from all sorts of sources e.g. door knobs, toilets or handrails onto your phone (your most often used item) and on to your face, hands, nose, mouth etc. PureCase therefore is an important part of daily personal hygiene just as washing your hands, cleaning your teeth or showering regularly is.
I hardly ever get sick – why would I need PureCase?PureCase not only protects you from bacteria but also other people you interact with each day by limiting the transfer of bacteria. This especially helps people with weak immune systems. 
Does PureCase also protect me from good bacteria?When you are a healthy person your body usually ensures that all good bacteria you need are there. PureCase protects you from spreading any kind of bacteria and it is harmful bacteria and pathogens that cause illnesses and that we want to contain. Just like showering or hand washing PureCase won’t throw your natural and good bacteria balance off course.",12.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The idea of 3DTuning came to us back in 2007, when one of our friends
 wanted to change the front grill of his already pretty old SUV, but 
could not find an easy way of visualizing the final result. This is how 
the 3DTuning story started for us and thanks to all of our users from 
214 countries all over the world - it seems like we are just at the 
beginning of this exciting journey!</p>

 form a dedicated team working solely on ""3DTuning <i>Edition Pro</i>"".
 It will reduce our development time by at least 4 months. We know how 
to increase the team very fast without compromising the quality of the 
project. During the course of the project we have used a number of 
free-lance resources and subcontractors, who are already familiar with 
our requirements and high standards of modeling.

The idea of 3DTuning came to us back in 2007, when one of our friends
 wanted to change the front grill of his already pretty old SUV, but 
could not find an easy way of visualizing the final result. This is how 
the 3DTuning story started for us and thanks to all of our users from 
214 countries all over the world - it seems like we are just at the 
beginning of this exciting journey!





Today,
 3DTuning.com and ""3DTuning"" mobile app is a unique photorealistic car 
configurator with more than 800 car models, millions of monthly visitors
 and ten million individual car projects generated by our users.










Pretty obvious, but non the less, WE LOVE CARS AND WE LOVE 3DTUNING :)

All key members of our team have been with 3DTuning since the very beginning of our project in 2007.

Currently we are a team of 30 full time programmers and 3D 
specialists, covering the web site and the mobile app, with almost 40% 
of our team being female (not a typical picture in ""car tuning"" project 
;)) 

You can see almost all of our team members in the video below, so it is very nice to meet all of you :)

If
 with your help we will be succeful in raising the necessary funds, we 
will be able to increase the current team by 30%, which will allow us to
 form a dedicated team working solely on ""3DTuning Edition Pro"".
 It will reduce our development time by at least 4 months. We know how 
to increase the team very fast without compromising the quality of the 
project. During the course of the project we have used a number of 
free-lance resources and subcontractors, who are already familiar with 
our requirements and high standards of modeling. 








The purpose of this campaign is not to make money, but to make ""3DTuning Edition Pro"" happen. 



We are investing approximately the same amount we have requested and 75% of the requested funding will go to additional and dedicated employes salaries. Below is the overall breakdown:


1) modeling costs                 45%  $ 42 000  3 months   10 people

4) buffer                                  10%  $ 10 000







In this kind of projects usually two type of risks are outlined:
1) functional - not all of the announced features can be realized;

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Our company was founded on a simple concept - security needs to be easy, or people won't use it.</p>
<p>The Gordian Vault is a solution to a problem - how can one securely handle data, when one can't trust the device it's running on?</p>
<p>Our CEO, Kate Gray, has dedicated her career to security, building solutions to protect companies and users from hackers.  She has worked as a security consultant and engineer, building solutions to security problems big and small.</p>
<p>One of the biggest issues facing end-users and organizations right now is how to handle security in apps.  Android and IOS are designed to isolate applications from each other for security (so your games can't read your online banking data, for example), but this very protection keeps security software from being able to scan your device for threats.  Tools to help users root and jailbreak their devices use the same exploits that hackers do; if you can root your device with one of those tools, someone who steals your phone can, too.</p>
<p>In industry, when something needs to be secure, we use a smart card.  Smart Cards are dedicated security computers, designed from the ground up to protect their keys from hackers, destroying themselves before they give up their secrets.  When satellite providers want to protect their feeds, they use a smart card.  When banks want to protect their credit cards (and your money) from cloning, they use a smart card.  From parking meters to laundry machines, printer refills to classified military systems, smart cards provide needed protection, even when the device itself can't.</p>
<p>Our Hardware Security Module provides the same degree of security, with hardware that meets Payment Card Industry standards, in a form factor compatible with Moto Z phones, and making it available to application developers.  This lets us provide a very high level of security, and protects the keys from viruses or other rogue applications as well as physical attack.</p>
<h2>Bitcoin Vault<br/> </h2>
<p>We're passionate about security, and working to protect our users.  That's why we are launching the Gordian Vault with support for Bitcoin - digital currency for the digital age.</p>
<p>Storing your Bitcoin keys in your Gordian Vault ensures that no application can steal your keys.  Transactions are confirmed on a dedicated security e-Ink display, and the keys never leave the vault.  Our vault is compatible with the Trezor protocol, making it easy for developers to support, and we will be launching with a supported wallet.</p>
<p>When you send Bitcoin, the address and amount are confirmed on the secure display, ensuring that you are sending money to where you want it to go.  When you receive Bitcoin, your address is displayed on the secure display, ensuring that the address shown belongs to you.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are accepting pre-orders in order to negotiate volume discounts, and to help offset the cost of development.  With your help, we can finalize the schematic, help fund development of the mobile-specific functionality, and work with our partners to finalize and manufacture the final form factor.</p>
<p>We have an existing HSM (Hardware Security Module) design based on the Kinetis K81 processor, which we are leveraging in order to bring the Gordian Vault to market quickly.</p>
<p>Purchasers of the Gordian Vault will get the Vault, as well as access to Bitcoin wallets and Authentication software compatible with Google Authenticator (OATH HOTP).</p>
<p>For users who do not yet have a Moto Z phone (such as users of the Moto G and Moto Z phones), we offer a dock that permits the mod to be used by bluetooth.  You can upgrade at any time without using any keys.</p>
<p>Moto Mods™ snap onto any Moto Z to give it a whole new superpower. They transform your phone allowing it to do things other phones can’t. To learn more visit <a href=""http://www.motomods.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.motomods.com</a>.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We will be releasing our technology an open API for any application (or manufacturer) to use without cost.  This API permits applications to store their data and keys, and mark them as secured - ensuring that they can not be extracted.  Our HSM has significant amount of storage space for keys, permitting it to be used for multiple wallets, and other applications (such as Google Authenticator-compatible authentication codes).</p>
<h2>Risks &amp; Challenges</h2>
<p>Building hardware is hard.  We have a great team, but a project like this takes time and money.</p>
<p>We will likely require several revisions on our PCB.  Those take time.  By sharing technology between the Gordian Vault and our other technologies, we are able to offset much of the cost.</p>
<p>Our design is expensive to build.  We use a high-end processor, a high-end screen, and we can't cut corners.  It means our margins are smaller, and it means that we will need to secure additional capital to fully complete the product.  We have raised over $50,000 in addition to this campaign, and will be raising additional funds, as well as contributing personal funds.</p>
<p>We have a long-term commitment to our Hardware Security Module platform, and will be using the same technology to provide security to other products and devices.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you know someone who could benefit from next-generation security available for their mobile device, please pass this campaign along.  Indiegogo has tools to make sharing easier.</p>

<p>Also, we provide a Web Accessibility Tool for Services, Information and transactional Web Pages.  This Tool may be included in any web page that wants Inclusite Service with out the modification of their content.  This will allow the Blind and Disabled people to visit a certain Web Page directly with out visiting our web page first.  This Tool can be as a Pop Up, Personalized Icon, Inclusite Icon, etc. </p>
<p>Some Examples: </p>

<p>That's why <b>Inclusite</b> was created: </p>
<p>To provide <b>Web Accessibility</b> for the Blind and Disabled People around the World, from any computer, in real time and <i>with out modifying the Web Pages.</i></p>

<p>There are over 190 million people in the World that cannot access the Web on their own!  And if we add the people who have difficulties accessing the web like seniors, the number exceeds 1 billion people (15% of World population).</p>

<p>Today there is no Web Based Software that can compare with Inclusite.  This means that we don't only have the opportunity to support this Human Right, but the OBLIGATION to do so.  <span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">                                       </span></p>

<p><b>WHY A CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN? </b></p>
<p>With this campaign, we want to raise awareness of the technology, gain your support and trust and show that the World needs a Web Accessibility Tool for the blind, disabled and elderly people.  </p>
<p>In many ways we are like a version of Google translate, but for the blind and disabled. What Inclusite needs is your HELP to get to a critical mass of people to create awareness and continue to make this possible for all.  </p>
<p>Access to the web is a Basic Right and is becoming a Law in many countries around the world.  </p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">We want to get 10,000 crowdfunding backers to help impact this much needed right, so we need you to join us! <b>With your support</b> we will reach our fundraising goal and will be able to create history together.</span></p>
<p><span style=""text-align: right; background-color: initial;"">Thank you for taking your time to read our story and helping us reach 1B People with disabilities.</span></p>

<p>Inclusite has its current operations in Spain, Argentina, Mexico and has just opened an office in The United States.  As of today, Inclusite has been successful by creating relationships with public and private companies who have websites that everyone would like to access.</p>
<p>These companies choose to upload Inclusite directly on-top of their website, allowing traffic to flow directly through their own web page without modifying anything.  <br/></p>
<p>However, Inclusite's GOAL is to provide this needed service <b>WORLD WIDE</b> to every current Web Page by supporting the transitions, by uploading  the  ‘most viewed’ 100,000 web pages in the World and by building our own Data Center in The United States.  We call  this ""INCLUSTING""</p>
<p><b>KEY FACT:</b> The more funding we have, the more web pages get Inclusited and more access to information for all. This is great for businesses as well, as they get to tap into this vast unrealized market of consumers!</p>

</div></div>","Inclusite is a Web Based Accessibility Tool & Search Engine that provides Blind and Disabled People independent internet accessibility to the world of information on the web.  



By uploading Web Pages to our platform to provide the  Inclusite Service.  This means that every time a Blind or Disabled Person wants to access a certain web page or information, they will be able to do so! One of the KEY ingredients here is that they can do it from ANY COMPUTER, in REAL TIME, ANYWHERE!  
For example:  Let's say Richard is a Blind person that wants to surf the web and he needs a specific web page to do so....Richard already knows about Inclusite and knows that, by accessing www.inclusite.com,  he can search the Web Page for his need and be able to access this Web information.  Richard also knows that he doesn't need any peripherals  to have access the web, just his computer.  Inclusite works with your breath, voice or keyboard.


For this to happen we need the proper funding to be able to upload, support and maintain every web page in the planet.
Also, we provide a Web Accessibility Tool for Services, Information and transactional Web Pages.  This Tool may be included in any web page that wants Inclusite Service with out the modification of their content.  This will allow the Blind and Disabled people to visit a certain Web Page directly with out visiting our web page first.  This Tool can be as a Pop Up, Personalized Icon, Inclusite Icon, etc. 
Some Examples: 



That's why Inclusite was created: 
To provide Web Accessibility for the Blind and Disabled People around the World, from any computer, in real time and with out modifying the Web Pages.




There are over 190 million people in the World that cannot access the Web on their own!  And if we add the people who have difficulties accessing the web like seniors, the number exceeds 1 billion people (15% of World population).



Today there is no Web Based Software that can compare with Inclusite.  This means that we don't only have the opportunity to support this Human Right, but the OBLIGATION to do so.                                         


WHY A CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN? 
With this campaign, we want to raise awareness of the technology, gain your support and trust and show that the World needs a Web Accessibility Tool for the blind, disabled and elderly people.  
In many ways we are like a version of Google translate, but for the blind and disabled. What Inclusite needs is your HELP to get to a critical mass of people to create awareness and continue to make this possible for all.  
Access to the web is a Basic Right and is becoming a Law in many countries around the world.  
We want to get 10,000 crowdfunding backers to help impact this much needed right, so we need you to join us! With your support we will reach our fundraising goal and will be able to create history together.
Thank you for taking your time to read our story and helping us reach 1B People with disabilities.
                                      With respect,  
                                                              Dr. Fernando Hernandez (Founder of Inclusite) 


          


                                      How many people are you willing to help?
                                           Be the reason someone smiles today!                                                
                                              








                       





Inclusite has its current operations in Spain, Argentina, Mexico and has just opened an office in The United States.  As of today, Inclusite has been successful by creating relationships with public and private companies who have websites that everyone would like to access.
These companies choose to upload Inclusite directly on-top of their website, allowing traffic to flow directly through their own web page without modifying anything.  
However, Inclusite's GOAL is to provide this needed service WORLD WIDE to every current Web Page by supporting the transitions, by uploading  the  ‘most viewed’ 100,000 web pages in the World and by building our own Data Center in The United States.  We call  this ""INCLUSTING""
KEY FACT: The more funding we have, the more web pages get Inclusited and more access to information for all. This is great for businesses as well, as they get to tap into this vast unrealized market of consumers!

For years, consumers have bought specific smartphones only due to their physical keyboards or stylus attachments. Without these key attributes, no one would buy these overpriced, outdated phones. We aim to bring the physical keyboard and stylus to any phone so you can enjoy the perks of modern phones such as stunning cameras, large screens, support from carriers and manufacturers and the fastest processors.</p><p><strong>The Keyboard</strong></p><p>           The keyboard is designed for a tactile feel to help the user’s be able to type faster. With a physical keyboard, the screen is not covered by the virtual keyboard and is fully usable. Plastic keycaps and a color adjustable backlight lead to a high quality typing experience. The keyboard is built with a 1000mAh battery which lasts 100 hours and can be charged in 2-3 hours using USB-C. Functions which do actions such as adjust volume and brightness help make using your phone easier.</p><p><strong>The Slider</strong></p><p>           The slider is designed to work for over 100,000 slides over its lifetime, meaning the Type I can be used over a long period of time and still work while being moved from phone to phone.</p><p><strong>The Stylus</strong></p><p>              Attached to the back of the slider is a mount that holds an included stylus. Not only is the stylus usable on your smartphone, but the other end is a ballpoint pen for writing on paper. Extendable for more comfortable usage, this stylus is a tool for signing papers – on paper and on a PDF.</p><p><strong>Water and Dust Resistant*</strong></p><p>               You need your keyboard to be able to take on the daily splashes and spills of daily life. That's why the keyboard component of the Type I will be water and dust resistant so you don’t need to worry about your TYPE I becoming damaged from dust or water from everyday usage.</p><p><strong>Assembly</strong></p><p>               The SES Mobile Accessories TYPE I is very easy to assemble. Use the included screwdriver to attach the keyboard to the slider. Then, using the same screwdriver, attach the screws to the mounts on the slider and the holes on the silicone casing.</p><p><strong>How It Works</strong></p><p>               The keyboard is attached to the slider using two screws which line up on an adjustable mount which helps the Type I accommodate all phone sizes. The screws also attach to two holes that attach to the silicone bumper. The silicone bumper is stretchy enough to accommodate most phones (some even in their cases) and also provides some protection to the phone if ever dropped.</p><p><strong>About Us</strong></p><p>               SES Mobile Accessories is a company that aims to transform the way the world uses smartphones through innovative ideas and designs that improve the productivity and usability of the tool we all use every day. Based in the Chicago area, home and birthplace of our founder, we are proud to design and develop our products in the area surrounding America’s second city.</p><p><strong>Why support us?</strong></p><p>             By supporting our campaign, you will be supporting an idea originally created in 3 years ago in an old notebook and developed, tweaked, redesigned and redesigned again to fit the changing needs of smartphone consumers. The one constant that has never changed during our development is the revolutionary goal of freeing the physical keyboard from the phone. Users shouldn't need to buy hardware that is outdated and expensive in order to get the physical keyboard which is why we are here to change that.</p><h2>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h2><p><strong>Where the money goes</strong></p><p>          We will need $120,000 to fund the initial run of TYPE I attachments, the top 3 expenses being the development and manufacturing of the keyboard, development and manufacturing the slider and packaging. </p><p><strong>The Impact</strong></p><p>           By supporting SES Mobile Accessories, you will show the world that the physical keyboard isn't a feature that belongs on old phones or niche products, but a powerful tool that can and should be used on today's newest smartphones. No more having half your screen blocked when typing, no more needing to look at the screen while you type, no more losing time from slower typing. By supporting the TYPE I, you say goodbye to these issues and focus on productivity so you can spend time on more important matters. The stylus is a similar case. Other phones come with a stylus which are either incredibly expensive or lacking in specs. You can now choose whatever phone you want to have a stylus by supporting the SES Mobile Accessories TYPE I!</p><p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p><p>          The biggest issue will likely be making this all work with a very small team that is delivering its first product, which will drive us to work as hard as we can to make a lasting and strong impression! We are all perfectionists and have spent the past year working to make sure that this device is as perfect as we can make it and have calculated the costs over and over again to make sure they are correct. Thank you for supporting us and we will make sure there is a TYPE I in your hands if we reach the goal!</p><p><strong>Share Us!</strong></p><p>LinkedIn - <a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/company/ses-mobile-accessories"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.linkedin.com/company/ses-mobile-acc...</a></p><p>Twitter -  <a href=""https://twitter.com/ses_mobile"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://twitter.com/ses_mobile</a></p><p>Instagram - <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/sesmobileaccessories/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.instagram.com/sesmobileaccessories/</a></p><p>Reddit - <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/sesmobileaccessories"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.reddit.com/user/sesmobileaccessories</a></p><p>Website - sesmobile.com</p><p>YouTube - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGsk1k2SQ3yyfg1rjPAJ5xg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGsk1k2SQ3yyfg...</a></p><p>*SES cannot guarantee at this time the degree of waterproofing or dustproofing that the TYPE I will be certified at or if certified at all.</p></div>","What is this?Hello!         The SES Mobile Accessories Type I is a keyboard attachment designed to work for a majority of smartphones to help increase productivity of its users through the usage of a physical keyboard and stylus.

Based in the Chicago area, home and birthplace of our founder, we are proud to design and develop our products in the area surrounding America’s second city.Why support us?             By supporting our campaign, you will be supporting an idea originally created in 3 years ago in an old notebook and developed, tweaked, redesigned and redesigned again to fit the changing needs of smartphone consumers. The one constant that has never changed during our development is the revolutionary goal of freeing the physical keyboard from the phone. Users shouldn't need to buy hardware that is outdated and expensive in order to get the physical keyboard which is why we are here to change that.What We Need & What You GetWhere the money goes          We will need $120,000 to fund the initial run of TYPE I attachments, the top 3 expenses being the development and manufacturing of the keyboard, development and manufacturing the slider and packaging. The Impact           By supporting SES Mobile Accessories, you will show the world that the physical keyboard isn't a feature that belongs on old phones or niche products, but a powerful tool that can and should be used on today's newest smartphones. No more having half your screen blocked when typing, no more needing to look at the screen while you type, no more losing time from slower typing. By supporting the TYPE I, you say goodbye to these issues and focus on productivity so you can spend time on more important matters. The stylus is a similar case. Other phones come with a stylus which are either incredibly expensive or lacking in specs. You can now choose whatever phone you want to have a stylus by supporting the SES Mobile Accessories TYPE I!Risks & Challenges          The biggest issue will likely be making this all work with a very small team that is delivering its first product, which will drive us to work as hard as we can to make a lasting and strong impression! We are all perfectionists and have spent the past year working to make sure that this device is as perfect as we can make it and have calculated the costs over and over again to make sure they are correct. Thank you for supporting us and we will make sure there is a TYPE I in your hands if we reach the goal!Share Us!LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/company/ses-mobile-acc...Twitter -  https://twitter.com/ses_mobileInstagram - https://www.instagram.com/sesmobileaccessories/Reddit - https://www.reddit.com/user/sesmobileaccessoriesWebsite - sesmobile.comYouTube - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGsk1k2SQ3yyfg...*SES cannot guarantee at this time the degree of waterproofing or dustproofing that the TYPE I will be certified at or if certified at all.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>What is the difference between PRIVAT and other security smartphones?</strong></p>
<p>PRIVAT is the only smartphone in the world to offer a security system based on hardware that guarantees 100% the efficiency of its security functions. Other security smartphones in the market are based on software functions, to encrypt or create access keys to files, making them vulnerable of trespassing. In addition, some security smartphones do not allow new apps to be installed, reducing the use of the smartphone.</p>
<p><strong> Can I receive calls when the security camera is on?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, when the security camera is being used, you can receive a call and answer it, because there is an alert (audio + led), so you could change to normal mode.</p>
<p><strong>Which hardware resources share both boards?</strong></p>
<p>Every electronic board (private camera board and smartphone board) has their own processor, storage, and operative system. However, they share secondary hardware resources that accomplish specific functions and under no circumstances do they put at risk the isolation of both boards.</p>
<p>These shared resources are the battery, display, microphone, speakers, cameras, and USB connector. The active board is the one that takes control of the shared resources.</p>
<p><strong>Can I take photos and post them directly on my social networks?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, when your PRIVAT is in normal mode, it works the same as any other smartphone. You can take your photos and share them immediately.</p>
<p>The Smartphone board will control the camera at that moment, and there will be no functionality restriction nor apps use.</p>
<p><strong>What guarantees will I not lose control of my photos and videos?</strong></p>
<p>All photos and videos you have taken on private camera mode will be captured and stored in the electronic board, which is designed for that purpose, and it has no connection to the conventional board, where you will find applications and no connectivity to wired or wireless networks. You can be 100% sure your photos and videos stored on the private camera board are safe.</p>
<p><strong>How can I extract my photos and videos from the private camera memory?</strong></p>
<p>There are three ways:</p>
<p>- Saving or copying them to the private camera SD card.</p>
<p>- Connecting a USB cable to a USB port being on camera private mode.</p>
<p>- Through the floating internal memory, files can be copied in a secure way between both electronic boards (private camera and smartphone). This floating internal memory is never shared at the same time with both boards or operative systems, which ensures a safe copy.</p>
<p><strong>Can I copy files from the smartphone board to the private camera board?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you can do it directly using the floating memory. This is a practical and safe way of copying files between both boards.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of files can I store in the security board or the private camera board?</strong></p>
<p>All kinds of files can be stored. There is no limitation on that. However, you can only open photos and videos files.</p>
<p><strong>Does the private camera have Wi-Fi or Bluetooth connection?</strong></p>
<p>No, there is no connection module, no Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or cellular data. The only way to extract files from this board is through a manual action made by the user. </p>
<p><strong>Can the two boards be activated at the same time?</strong></p>
<p>No, only one board can be activated at a time. But some functionalities can remain in operation, like messages or calls, when using the private camera.</p>
<p><strong>How does the anti-spy mode work?</strong></p>
<p>It physically disconnects the cameras and the microphones, so it is impossible for spyware to turn them on.</p>
<p><strong>What is the physical disconnection of the GPS for?</strong></p>
<p>It avoids being accurately tracked, so it could be possible to know his daily routine.</p>
<p><strong>What guarantees will I receive my PRIVAT Smartphone?</strong></p>
<p>The crowdfunding campaign has a fixed goal, which means Indiegogo will only send the money if the goal is reached; otherwise, it will be returned to the backers. Also, the project is already in an advanced phase.</p>
<p><strong>Will PRIVAT work in my country?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, its communication modules work with the technologies used by cellular operators around the world. In addition, it has FCC and CE certification in accordance with the standards of the industry.</p>
<p><strong>Will PRIVAT be unlocked to work with any operator?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it will not have any restrictions.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any restriction for installing apps?</strong></p>
<p>There is no restriction. In the normal mode, you can install and use the apps like any other smartphone.</p>
<p><strong>Does the privacy screen protector come with PRIVAT?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, it is an accessory that comes with all PRIVAT Smartphones, and it is up to the user to use it.</p>
<p><strong>How does the privacy screen protector work?</strong></p>
<p>The privacy screen protector keeps the person next to you from seeing what you are doing on your PRIVAT, because the protector reduces the angle vision up to 45°, which means it can only be seen by its user.</p>
<p><strong>Can I charge my PRIVAT Smartphone with a wireless charger?</strong></p>
<p>You can use that kind of charger on your PRIVAT Smartphone.</p>

<h3>MY BACKGROUND</h3>
<p>My background includes 15 years in ""corporate America"" and 15 years in more entreprenurial roles. I love solving problems as evidenced by my 9 patents and many FDA-cleared medical devices. The Small Business Administration trusted me enough to approve a $1.6 million loan on a business that I bought and recently sold and paid-back the loan. </p>
<p>I invented a digital tag tag system for dentures called DentureID.com. Since then, many people said I should develop a similar system for valuables. So I secured the domain ""itag.com"" and developed a robust cloud-based data storage and retrieval system. FOREVER TAG uses this system and unique QR codes to save and retrieve personal identfication information.</p>
<p>My hope is that you will support the project to help me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fund commercial quantity of inventory</li>
<li>Develop awareness and trial of the product</li>
<li>Create new applications on a variety of materials</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>YOUR REWARD</h3>

</div></div>","MY BACKGROUND
My background includes 15 years in ""corporate America"" and 15 years in more entreprenurial roles. I love solving problems as evidenced by my 9 patents and many FDA-cleared medical devices. The Small Business Administration trusted me enough to approve a $1.6 million loan on a business that I bought and recently sold and paid-back the loan. 
I invented a digital tag tag system for dentures called DentureID.com. Since then, many people said I should develop a similar system for valuables. So I secured the domain ""itag.com"" and developed a robust cloud-based data storage and retrieval system. FOREVER TAG uses this system and unique QR codes to save and retrieve personal identfication information.
My hope is that you will support the project to help me:

Fund commercial quantity of inventory
Develop awareness and trial of the product
Create new applications on a variety of materials


YOUR REWARD
I guarantee you will get the reward(s) that you select. Even if I don't reach the project goal, you will get your reward because I have already made some inventory in low (expensive) batch quantities. Your enthusiasm and funding will give me confidence to make lower cost inventory in larger quantities.

PEOPLE ARE TRUSTWORTHY

<p>It takes us 2 years to create the prototype of FAMBO. During the past 2 years, we have tested 12 different ARM chips, including Rockchip, AllWinner, Samsung, and Amlogic. </p>
<p>We tested the video encoding and decoding performances, to make sure FAMBO have excellent video streaming performance. We changed the drivers in Android source code, so that it can support all the 3 cameras and the ZigBee chip provided by TI. </p>
<p>We also developed applications for FAMBO and smartphones. </p>

</div>
<div>
<p></p>
</div>The FAMBO team has been working on smart home systems since 2011. Most of the engineers have worked more than 10 years either in software or hardware development. Tens of ARM chips have been tested. Dozens of PCBs have been designed, made and tested. Hundreds of software versions have been developed. All these work contributes to the first prototype of FAMBO. <br/><br/>But the FAMBO team is still a small team. All the team members work with interest and enthusiasm. We all believe that we can make a difference to this world. <br/><br/>We design the product, make and test the hardware, modify Android source code, and develop FAMBO applications. In addition, we make our introduction videos ourselves. </div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>

<div>We are a group of new parents. We developed the FAMBO to help you spend more quality time with your kids and store every good memory. <br/>
</div>To start <b>mass production</b>, we must raise enough funds to make 2000 units. With your valuable support, we can achieve economies of scale and keep the product cost low, so that more people can enjoy their family life with FAMBO. <br/>

<div>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Our team has been working on FAMBO for 2 years. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The FAMBO and BlackPearl you see above are <b>REAL WORKING</b> prototypes. We will continue refining the hardware and upgrading software before and after mass production of FAMBO. </span></p>
<br/>
</div>
<div>During the past years, we have built very good and stable relationship with our hardware suppliers in Shenzhen, China. As our team is based in China, we can have much more control over our OEM factories. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Of course, no project is without any risk and challenges but we are doing our best to minimize them. We felt that we have done all the necessary preliminary work prior to launching a project on indiegogo. </div>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Birth of FAMBO
It takes us 2 years to create the prototype of FAMBO. During the past 2 years, we have tested 12 different ARM chips, including Rockchip, AllWinner, Samsung, and Amlogic. 
We tested the video encoding and decoding performances, to make sure FAMBO have excellent video streaming performance. We changed the drivers in Android source code, so that it can support all the 3 cameras and the ZigBee chip provided by TI. 
We also developed applications for FAMBO and smartphones. 








----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 



A Highly Integrated Smart Home System
FAMBO is designed as the in-home control center of the smart home system. All the popular wireless communication protocols are supported, including: 

WIFI
Bluetooth
ZigBee


WIFI is the most widely used wireless technology. Bluetooth is used in many new devices. In addition, we add ZigBee module into FAMBO, which does very good in low-power consumption and in-house communication. Here is the summarizing of ZigBee and Bluetooth: 


(See: http://www.greenpeak.com/Company/Opinions/CeesL... )



More ZigBee accessories will be added in near future, which makes the FAMBO system more powerful and interesting.

TIMELINE







----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
ABOUT US



The FAMBO team has been working on smart home systems since 2011. Most of the engineers have worked more than 10 years either in software or hardware development. Tens of ARM chips have been tested. Dozens of PCBs have been designed, made and tested. Hundreds of software versions have been developed. All these work contributes to the first prototype of FAMBO. But the FAMBO team is still a small team. All the team members work with interest and enthusiasm. We all believe that we can make a difference to this world. We design the product, make and test the hardware, modify Android source code, and develop FAMBO applications. In addition, we make our introduction videos ourselves. 







----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


Why we need your help?
We are a group of new parents. We developed the FAMBO to help you spend more quality time with your kids and store every good memory. 
To start mass production, we must raise enough funds to make 2000 units. With your valuable support, we can achieve economies of scale and keep the product cost low, so that more people can enjoy their family life with FAMBO. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 


Risks & Challenges


Our team has been working on FAMBO for 2 years. The FAMBO and BlackPearl you see above are REAL WORKING prototypes. We will continue refining the hardware and upgrading software before and after mass production of FAMBO. 


During the past years, we have built very good and stable relationship with our hardware suppliers in Shenzhen, China. As our team is based in China, we can have much more control over our OEM factories. 

Of course, no project is without any risk and challenges but we are doing our best to minimize them. We felt that we have done all the necessary preliminary work prior to launching a project on indiegogo.

<p>*  Custom notification alerting on all sensors with real-time chart analysis.<br/>** Requires Raspberry Pi for full functionality.<br/>*** Requires an e220 modem dongle with suitable sim for 3g connectivity.</p>
<span>With the right sensors and configuration the following timely alert situations can be detected by Pi HG and sent direct to your mobile device in seconds.</span><br/> <ul>
<li><span>High power use after 5.30pm - Cooker left ON !</span></li>
<li><span>Front door left OPEN !</span></li>
<li><span>No Kitchen activity by 9am, is your relative ok ?</span></li>
<li><span>Property activity detected when you are at work or on Holiday !</span></li>
<li><span>Flood or Rain alert !</span></li>
<li><span>Hot water tank temperature cold, forget that hot bath !</span></li>
<li><span>6am Frost alert - outside temp below freezing !</span></li>
<li><span>High wind speed - possible damage to property !</span></li>
<li><span>Heavy rainfall - possible flooding !</span></li>
<li><span>Sensor X battery voltage low ! </span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>The software will be provided for a nominal admin charge initially on SD card and I am now in a position to share the hardware platform to every Raspberry Pi user for an incredibly low price. </span></p>
<h2>What we need &amp; What do I get ?</h2>
</div><p>For a successful campaign and to make initial production viable I need sufficient funds to manufacture 500 PiHG boards. Many campaigns stall and fail by the initial high manufacture costs but because all boards are ready to go and with sensors being sold in DIY format - this will not happen. The Raspberry Pi was built and sold to improve learning &amp; education and Pi HomeGuard will continue with this theme. All sensors will initially be self build following a set of simple instructions. The complexity is now handled by the sensor board firmware making the construction possible with only a few cheap component modules.<br/>As an example when a door opens, to ensure detection, the open event has to be held ON for several transmit cycles. On my first version I needed a 555 timer delay circuit to hold the signal ON for at least 30 seconds. This added cost and complexity and the 555 circuit was not easy to build. This is now all handled in the firmware and we now only need two components, a 9901 sensor board and the magnetic door switch !</p><p>As a default Pi Homeguard monitors power usage on sensor 0 and board temperature on sensor 10. Up to nine other sensors can be added, but the humidity/temperature sensor only uses one channel.</p><p><b>Basic HG System connected by USB to Raspberry Pi B+</b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477577616/dq6d1adkfiarbluwdeyd.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><b>Basic system also includes Power clamp and wireless Transmitter but it does not include the above shown USB cable or cased Raspberry Pi.</b></p><div>As a starter this gives you a basic power monitor on sensor 0 and temperature on sensor 10. Even this basic system is useful to detect kettle power spikes, power highs like cooker left on and property temperatures.</div><div>
<br/><u><strong>Pi Connectivity:</strong></u>
</div><div>You have two Pi connection options;<br/> </div><ul>
<li>USB - using the PL2303 cable you can connect to the Pi by USB.<br/> </li>
<li>GPIO - or for the more technical direct to the Pi GPIO. This is very useful on the Pi Zero where the single usb port can then be used for 3gmodem or wifi dongle.</li>
</ul><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1477577676/d8tieealnwdxxcqxt80b.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/><strong>Pi HG connected to Pi Zero by direct GPIO connection</strong></p><div>The less technical can use the below PL2303 cable for a cleaner USB connection.</div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474406960/hwylxeh40hlqetmt3ye2.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/><br/>Note: If using a Pi Zero or GPIO connection the above cable is not necessary.</p><p><b>Sensor Build:</b><br/>After selecting the basic system you then decide what additional wireless sensors you want to add to your system. Only <i><strong>minor soldering skills</strong></i> are necessary, they are all very easy to build and use minimal components, but please remember to select the correct sensor board firmware (990x) for the sensor being built.<strong> </strong></p><div>

The Humidity/Temperature sensor (shown right) has the same attributes and can operate with the cheaper DHT11 (blue) or more accurate DHT22 (white) digital sensors.</div><div> </div><p><b>Sensor Battery Life:</b><br/>The battery life greatly depends upon sensor activity, but on test the door sensor has an estimated life of three years. The battery life of the humidity/temp sensor is however much less and a life of around 9 months can be expected. The life of a PiR sensor depends on activity in the area being monitored. One option as used in the door sensor video is to use ""sleep mode"" which only transmits data when triggered. The down side is you only get a battery voltage reading when the sensor is triggered, but for most situations this should be ok, the choice is yours.</p><p><b>Hosting Data:</b><br/>The sensor data can be hosted internally on the Pi which is stored in a Round Robin Database (rrd) format and is sized for ten years. But other options are available to store the data externally with CurrentCare, Xively or with EmonCMS. The external options are triggered by adding the appropriate API key to the config file.</p><h3><b><b>How does it all work?</b></b></h3><ul></ul><ol>
<li>First get your Pi HomeGuard hardware with SD card</li>
<li>Follow the self build sensor instructions</li>
<li>Load the SD card into your Raspberry Pi, connect to your network and apply power</li>
<li>Using your browser load <a href=""http://192.168.1.143/config"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://Pi-Local-IP     </a><a href=""http://192.168.1.143/config"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">   (Pi-Local-IP?  see Faq's) </a>
</li>
<li>Pair all your sensors to their respective channels</li>
<li>Edit the sensor config file and change labels &amp; colours as necessary</li>
<li>Load the Pi Local address (eg: 192.168.1.xx ) in your browser and watch the data appear</li>
<li>If necessary amend the graph layout or amend your alerts at: <a href=""http://192.168.1.143/config"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://Pi-Local-IP/editor</a>

</ol><div> </div><h3><b>Software:</b></h3><p>Depending on your requirements the software is totally flexible and can be used in several different ways. The default config has your Pi running, data collection, processing, raw data hosting and data alerting. The internal Pi data is stored in a Round Robin Database (rrd) format and is sized for ten years. I've been running the default Pi hosting software on my Pi for nearly three years, the presentation is a little primitive but it does work and has proved to be very useful and reliable.

With the right sensors and configuration the following timely alert situations can be detected by Pi HG and sent direct to your mobile device in seconds. 
High power use after 5.30pm - Cooker left ON !
Front door left OPEN !
No Kitchen activity by 9am, is your relative ok ?
Property activity detected when you are at work or on Holiday !
Flood or Rain alert !
Hot water tank temperature cold, forget that hot bath !
6am Frost alert - outside temp below freezing !
High wind speed - possible damage to property !
Heavy rainfall - possible flooding !
Sensor X battery voltage low ! 

The software will be provided for a nominal admin charge initially on SD card and I am now in a position to share the hardware platform to every Raspberry Pi user for an incredibly low price. 
What we need & What do I get ?
For a successful campaign and to make initial production viable I need sufficient funds to manufacture 500 PiHG boards. Many campaigns stall and fail by the initial high manufacture costs but because all boards are ready to go and with sensors being sold in DIY format - this will not happen. The Raspberry Pi was built and sold to improve learning & education and Pi HomeGuard will continue with this theme. All sensors will initially be self build following a set of simple instructions. The complexity is now handled by the sensor board firmware making the construction possible with only a few cheap component modules.As an example when a door opens, to ensure detection, the open event has to be held ON for several transmit cycles. On my first version I needed a 555 timer delay circuit to hold the signal ON for at least 30 seconds. This added cost and complexity and the 555 circuit was not easy to build. This is now all handled in the firmware and we now only need two components, a 9901 sensor board and the magnetic door switch !As a default Pi Homeguard monitors power usage on sensor 0 and board temperature on sensor 10. Up to nine other sensors can be added, but the humidity/temperature sensor only uses one channel.Basic HG System connected by USB to Raspberry Pi B+Basic system also includes Power clamp and wireless Transmitter but it does not include the above shown USB cable or cased Raspberry Pi.As a starter this gives you a basic power monitor on sensor 0 and temperature on sensor 10. Even this basic system is useful to detect kettle power spikes, power highs like cooker left on and property temperatures.
Pi Connectivity:
You have two Pi connection options; 
USB - using the PL2303 cable you can connect to the Pi by USB. 
GPIO - or for the more technical direct to the Pi GPIO. This is very useful on the Pi Zero where the single usb port can then be used for 3gmodem or wifi dongle.
Pi HG connected to Pi Zero by direct GPIO connectionThe less technical can use the below PL2303 cable for a cleaner USB connection.Note: If using a Pi Zero or GPIO connection the above cable is not necessary.Sensor Build:After selecting the basic system you then decide what additional wireless sensors you want to add to your system. Only minor soldering skills are necessary, they are all very easy to build and use minimal components, but please remember to select the correct sensor board firmware (990x) for the sensor being built. 
All sensors use the same wireless board transmitter to send data to the Pi and the sensor battery condition is also transmitted meaning you can spot batteries getting flat before they fail. This can of course be added as a sensor alert when the voltage of sensor# falls to a determined value.
Sensor firmware ref and build components used:9901 Door Open/Close - Sensor board and Magnetic door switch9901 can also be used for Toilet Flush - Sensor board and float sensor9902 Humidity/Temperature - Sensor board, DHT22/11 sensor & 10k resistor9903 Not allocated...................................................9904 PiR movement - Sensor board, HC-SR501 sensor, 5v power board9905 Wind speed - Sensor board, Maplins N25FR Anemometer9906 Rain Gauge - Sensor board, Maplins N25FR Rain Gauge9907 Flood - Sensor board, Flood level sensor
Initially only six sensor designs will be launched, but other sensors will be made available as demands dictate. One possible next version is for Carbon Monoxide.Note: a comprehensive build document is sent with each sensor type. PIR motion sensor and Humidity/Temperature sensor:
The HG PIR sensor (shown left) is small, wireless, portable and with a 7m range can be placed in any suitable room location, hidden from view and yet fully functional. The Humidity/Temperature sensor (shown right) has the same attributes and can operate with the cheaper DHT11 (blue) or more accurate DHT22 (white) digital sensors. Sensor Battery Life:The battery life greatly depends upon sensor activity, but on test the door sensor has an estimated life of three years. The battery life of the humidity/temp sensor is however much less and a life of around 9 months can be expected. The life of a PiR sensor depends on activity in the area being monitored. One option as used in the door sensor video is to use ""sleep mode"" which only transmits data when triggered. The down side is you only get a battery voltage reading when the sensor is triggered, but for most situations this should be ok, the choice is yours.Hosting Data:The sensor data can be hosted internally on the Pi which is stored in a Round Robin Database (rrd) format and is sized for ten years. But other options are available to store the data externally with CurrentCare, Xively or with EmonCMS. The external options are triggered by adding the appropriate API key to the config file.How does it all work?
First get your Pi HomeGuard hardware with SD card
Follow the self build sensor instructions
Load the SD card into your Raspberry Pi, connect to your network and apply power
Using your browser load http://Pi-Local-IP        (Pi-Local-IP?  see Faq's) 

Pair all your sensors to their respective channels
Edit the sensor config file and change labels & colours as necessary
Load the Pi Local address (eg: 192.168.1.xx ) in your browser and watch the data appear
If necessary amend the graph layout or amend your alerts at: http://Pi-Local-IP/editor

To host your Pi data on the internet see Faq's
To send your data to external hosts see Faq's
 Software:Depending on your requirements the software is totally flexible and can be used in several different ways. The default config has your Pi running, data collection, processing, raw data hosting and data alerting. The internal Pi data is stored in a Round Robin Database (rrd) format and is sized for ten years. I've been running the default Pi hosting software on my Pi for nearly three years, the presentation is a little primitive but it does work and has proved to be very useful and reliable. Each raw chart take about one second to generate which is amazing considering all the other stuff the Pi is running.The top header block shows the current power usage & temperature as at timestamp.The next block shows nine labeled sensors with the last reading and battery voltage. The colours help identify each sensor on the following charts.If necessary click the left magnify icon to expand last timestamp list.Activity charts then give a timeline presentation which show which sensor has been triggered recently and the colours help identify room activity.The Power usage chart shows the 3kW kettle spikes at 6am.We also have charts for temperature & humidity.
Wind speed & rainfall. and lastly - powers costs per hour / day / week.The above chart timelines can be easily changed (eg: Last 2h,7d,12w,3m) or disabled.You can see a working live example at:  http://www.pihomeguard.com
 
EmonCMS DashboardBut you could have the data hosted elsewhere, at for example Emoncms. All you do is add your API key to the config file and see the same data presented as on the below dashboard link:https://emoncms.org/jamieg/homeguard 
CurrentCare DashboardOr using a different API key in the config have the data hosted to the Current Care dashboard:
Virtual CottageYet another way to present the same data is to use the internal virtual cottage, all current main sensor data is presented on the one virtual icon;The chimney smoke, windows and door all change depending on sensor activity.  No room activity for 15mins & one panel grey, 30mins two panels grey, no activity for over one hour and curtains close.  Image can be displayed on your mobile device and gets updated every 5 mins.View a live presentation at:   http://www.pihomeguard.com/cottage

Sensor AlertingOne powerful feature is to have full control of any alerting on any sensor with the ability to have multiple alerts for the same sensor.
Any Day 1730-1930 High power use - Cooker left ON !
Any Day anytime - Front door left OPEN for >5mins !
Any Day No Kitchen activity by 9am, Is Mum Ok ?
Mon-Fri 0900-1700 Property Activity when you are at Work !
Any Day at 0900 - Battery Voltage of sensor# is below 2.2v !
Once a sensor alert has triggered you can decide when to repeat any further alerts. Sensor alerts currently have the option to use ""IFTTT"" or ""Pushover"", again configured by adding the appropriate API key to the config file. CactiYe another internal option is to use Cacti which has the ability to drill-down to a particular date and time and view any sensor data using your browser. Q and A
How do I find the Pi local IP address?Best way is to use a $6 IC Keypad Plate display, but with no display the Pi local IP can be found a number of ways:
 using a port scanner software like http://www.advanced-port-scanner.com

 or a mobile App called ""Fing"" for Android & iOS. 
Fing Android:https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=c...Fing iOS:https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/fing-network-sc...
 
The power sensor is supplied ready made, why don't you supply all sensors in same fashion?This may happen eventually but the cost for sensor molds would hold back the launch. The final cost would also have to add sufficient margin to make the business risk worthwhile making most sensors cost double the kit price.I don't have broadband but do get a good 3g signal, can I still use HomeGuard?Yes the Pi software is configured to run as cable network, WiFi or even a 3g dongle.( Note: Recommended 3g dongle is the e220 )How can I host my Pi data on the internet?
You would normally need a fixed IP to host on the internet but another feature is the ability to use duckdns to allow external hosting. All you do is register your DuckDNS address at https://www.duckdns.org and then add your Duck DNS Token to your PiHG config file. You also have to configure your router to forward port 80 from your Pi-local-IP. 
How can I post my Pi sensor data to external clouds on the internet?PiHG is currently pre-configured to post data to; Emoncms, Xivley and CurrentCareThey all follow the same process where you register on their site and get an API key code. This code is then added to the PiHG config file and data will be automatically posted to your chosen external cloud. 
Is my site secure?Unless someone knows your site name eg: MyNiceName.duckdns.org  it is unlikely to be found by anyone. But even if found the name and information will not mean anything to anybody. If someone found your site and tried to hack the site the utility Fail2ban has been installed to ban any further activity from the hacker IP. But if you are concerned PiHomeGuard can be configured to just post data to the local Catci or external clouds like EmonCMS which all have their own userid & password control. How many sensors do I need?This is a personal choice but even the basic power monitor system which comes with temperature monitor can be very useful. It can detect kettle power spikes, power highs like cooker left on and property temperature.I want PiHG but cant solder, can you provide ready made sensors?The initial goal is to raise enough funds to manufacture the PiHG board. If the campaign is successful providing ready made sensors could become an option. But you could buy a simple $10 soldering kit and learn yourself. Who knows, it could be the first step to a new career and open other opportunities.   Is it possible to add a display?Yes and this is recommended. For an additional $5 ( ebay search ""I2C display pi"" ) you can add your own I2C Keypad Plate direct to the Pi header.  Note: also works with Pi Zero.Using the on-board buttons this gives you the ability to:
Up  - Check your IP address & update duckdns.
Hold Right - Shutdown & Restart.
Hold Down - Shutdown & Halt.
Select - Display last sensor readings and help with sensor pairing.
Left - not used (yet).

The software is pre-configured to run the above I2C Keypad Plate as default, the display is not needed but for the extra $5 you may find it very useful. What models of Pi are supported ?I've tested the current software running on the old Model B, newer B+ and Pi Zero.
Will PiHG work on the Pi Zero ?Yes, PiHG can connect direct to the GPIO saving the Pi Zero usb port for 3gmodem or WiFi. How did all this start ? This is me and my Mum, taken before she took ill. We all have something we care about in life but the most important thing we value is usually our family and friends. About 3 years ago mum, then a widow, aged 89 was told by her doctor she could ""go"" at anytime and she was told to give up driving.

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Why we invented the Pocketsy?</strong></h2>
<p>Women clothing mostly comes with small or without pockets. So we end up carrying a handbag, despite there being so many things that are more enjoyable when our hands are free- And that’s seriously annoying!  For that reason over 80% of women may carry valuables in their bra, where it looks bulky, is not very comfortable and items such as phones might get sweaty- No more!!! </p>

<p>Hi- I’m Paula, I’m the co-founder of the pocketsy. I didn’t like carrying a bag when I was out and using a bra to carry my valuables came with too many disadvantages. But I still thought that a Bra was quite the perfect spot for a woman to put her stuff. So I started searching for a bra with pockets, that would be my perfect all-in one solution. But it DIDN’T EXIST! All the pocket bra’s I found had three main problems:</p> <p>They looked functional and not like something I’d want to wear.</p>
<p>The pockets were to small or not integrated. </p>
<p>The pockets weren’t easily accessible, and you kind of had to take off your clothes to access them … not very practical. </p> <p>So I teamed up with Dilara, my co-founder, who had been looking for the perfect mug-safe Bra for traveling. </p>

<p><b><br/></b></p><p><b>Automotive manufacturers deliberately de-tune an engine’s
ECU (Engine Control Unit) by utilizing a ‘generic’ setting within the software
so that tuning can be safely averaged for mass produced vehicles not tailoring
for individual circumstances. For this reason, engines are not able to run at
optimum power and efficiency due to varying factors including climate, fuel
quality variations, laws &amp; restrictions, altitude and driving habits. <br/>
The Berry system automatically interprets data from various sensors within the
engine and provides the ECU with a world first live modified map within the

<h3></h3><h3>About the Founder</h3><p><i>""</i><i> From his teenage years as an avid fanatic with everything from advanced mechanical projects and auto-motives to computer programming and design, Aaron later become a member of the Australian army studying military surveillance and security. After an honorable discharge, he completed a trade and studied in Mechanical Engineering. Currently, in his late 20's, he is further developing his skills in advanced micro controllers, mechatronics, programmable logic and broadening his design engineering skills</i><i>.""</i></p><h3>Prototypes</h3><p><i>
</i><b>Aaron has previously developed a highly advanced system
specifically for diesel engines and began steps to manufacture the item for
consumers in 2013.  Though due to its
intrusive nature by having to intercept various engine sensors (Throttle
Position, Fuel and manifold pressure, air temp, EGR and air flow) in an
under-the-bonnet installation he decided not to release the product on the
consumer market which was already flooded with intercept chips (though nowhere
near as advanced).  This reason further
pushed for research into the workings of the factory system and how to harness
a vehicles existing mapping software.</b></p><p><i>

highly effective and aesthetically pleasing product.</b></p><h3>Manufacturing</h3><p><b>Berry Robotics are truly satisfied that every avenue has
been explored to have a product ready for production in its entirety.  The final prototype of the Berry in all aspects
including design, hardware, programming, enclosure, manufacturing processes
including highly expensive injection mold tooling and testing have been
complete!  The system is active and
tested to date on all OBD2 compliant vehicles with results continually
exceeding expectations.  Estimated
expenses have exceeded the original budget, though the end result has proven to
be worth the sacrifice, with over 5 years of dedicated research and countless
man hours poured into developing a truly refined product.  Manufacturing tenders were placed in April
2016 focusing purely on quality, with most of the successful partners from

</div>","“The motivation behind the berry was simple; create a modern
plug-n-play device which refines economy and power” – Aaron Hunter, Berry
Robotics FounderThe Berry system is the world’s most advanced automotive computer system.  By modifying your vehicles existing computer, the berry is able to intelligently refine your engine to increase engine performance by proven tests of up to 28% or decrease fuel consumption by up to 10%.  With smartphone Bluetooth connectivity, users are also able to connect wirelessly to any smartphone to view real time performance data, fuel consumption, engine gauges and a whole lot more!
Easy Installation:With a one button installation, anyone can install a berry
in a matter of minutes.  As
the Berry system does not change ANY factory settings on the vehicles default
computer, it will not void manufacturer’s warranty and is reversible at any
time by simply removing the system from the On Board Diagnostic connection
found under the steering wheel column of most makes.

    

The OBD2 Port (required for berry connection) commonly found above the pedals or along side the center console on most makes

Your choice of 3 Berry's
Automotive manufacturers deliberately de-tune an engine’s
ECU (Engine Control Unit) by utilizing a ‘generic’ setting within the software
so that tuning can be safely averaged for mass produced vehicles not tailoring
for individual circumstances. For this reason, engines are not able to run at
optimum power and efficiency due to varying factors including climate, fuel
quality variations, laws & restrictions, altitude and driving habits. 
The Berry system automatically interprets data from various sensors within the
engine and provides the ECU with a world first live modified map within the
software to give the absolute optimum efficiency of the vehicle for not only
fuel economy, but torque, power and throttle response. 

About the Founder"" From his teenage years as an avid fanatic with everything from advanced mechanical projects and auto-motives to computer programming and design, Aaron later become a member of the Australian army studying military surveillance and security. After an honorable discharge, he completed a trade and studied in Mechanical Engineering. Currently, in his late 20's, he is further developing his skills in advanced micro controllers, mechatronics, programmable logic and broadening his design engineering skills.""Prototypes
Aaron has previously developed a highly advanced system
specifically for diesel engines and began steps to manufacture the item for
consumers in 2013.  Though due to its
intrusive nature by having to intercept various engine sensors (Throttle
Position, Fuel and manifold pressure, air temp, EGR and air flow) in an
under-the-bonnet installation he decided not to release the product on the
consumer market which was already flooded with intercept chips (though nowhere
near as advanced).  This reason further
pushed for research into the workings of the factory system and how to harness
a vehicles existing mapping software.


With Aaron’s obsessive nature to develop a product that’s
not only the most intelligent electronic plug-in device available, but a
product that well exceeds anything else available on the market.  A very extensive array of prototypes have
been developed (and failed Aaron’s Expectations) leaving an incredibly refined,
highly effective and aesthetically pleasing product.ManufacturingBerry Robotics are truly satisfied that every avenue has
been explored to have a product ready for production in its entirety.  The final prototype of the Berry in all aspects
including design, hardware, programming, enclosure, manufacturing processes
including highly expensive injection mold tooling and testing have been
complete!  The system is active and
tested to date on all OBD2 compliant vehicles with results continually
exceeding expectations.  Estimated
expenses have exceeded the original budget, though the end result has proven to
be worth the sacrifice, with over 5 years of dedicated research and countless
man hours poured into developing a truly refined product.  Manufacturing tenders were placed in April
2016 focusing purely on quality, with most of the successful partners from
Australia.
Manufacturing Locations:

The Aluminum enclosure will a be produced by a quality manufacturer in China
The molded lid for the enclosure will be produced in Australia
Chipsets and circuit board to be assembled in Australia
Software programming will be in Australia
The entire assembly process will be performed in Australia
All products will have final inspection by Berry Robotics in Australia for quality assurance
Any unlikely warranty claims will be fully assessed by Berry Robotics in Australia

   
Risk and Challenges
Any project is never immune to problems, though if issues were to arise
with production errors, Berry has taken the initiative to have ‘backup’
manufacturers in place to counter any possible delays with getting the product
to the consumer as quickly as possible. 
Expected delivery dates on the campaign are set later than the expected
completion date of the product as a safe guard for any potential delays in the manufacturing.  Berry have fortunately had various experiences with production processes
and are very familiar with lead times and manufacturing protocols, rest assured
your kickstarter backing is in good hands!
 

Thank you!

<h2>How it all started</h2>
<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>We are Rasim, Teymur, and Tural - co-founders of <a href=""http://ratersapp.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Raters</a>. </p>
<p>As many of you, we love watching great movies, discovering new actors and directors, and, most importantly, sharing all of this with friends who share a similar passion for cinema. </p>
<p>However, every attempt to watch something new would be accompanied by questions such as ""What should we watch?"", ""What was the movie Emily was talking about?"", ""What would Pedro say about this film?"" and so on...</p>
<p>...and, yes, this would take hours. </p>
<p>To solve this issue for ourselves and for all the movie enthusiasts out there, we decided to create an app that would allow users to connect with people whose taste they trust and have their movie reviews and Watchlists all in one place. In other words - to create Raters.   <br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532557531/ocs35p45isjbcuo4y1ee.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h2>Didn't you guys just reinvent the wheel?</h2>
<p>With so many movie platforms like IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and Netflix, why do we need another one? The answer is simple - your friends. If you think about it, quite frequently good movie recommendations emerge from your conversations with friends and acquaintances.</p>
<p>The key difference between Raters and conventional movie platforms is its focus on the social aspect and interaction between movie enthusiasts. Raters allows you to see what movies your friends have watched recently, how they rated them and what they thought about them. Besides, you can like and comment on their reviews, facilitating further discussion, which may lead you to your new favourite movie.</p>
<p><strong>Raters:</strong><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1532980431/w8plodzksbesl372igze.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>Why do we exist?</h2>
<p>We have an ambitious aim to help develop the film industry, and our goals can be categorised into two broad areas:</p>
<p>1. For users, we seek to create a global community of movie lovers where they can share their experiences and find movies that they will enjoy.</p>
<p>2. For independent studios and directors, we seek to create a platform where they can find their relevant audiences, who are most likely to be interested in their films.<br/> </p>
<h2>Why this campaign is so important for us</h2>
<p>It has been a long and rocky (but also a super-fun) road from the day the idea was conceived. </p>
<p>Today we have a fully working version of our <u><a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/raters-movie-lovers-network/id1258540735?mt=8"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">app</a></u> on the App Store (and we would love to hear your feedback!)</p>
<p>What we also have is an avalanche of ideas we would like to test and implement to enhance user experience. Your support would allow us to realize our ambitions and to fulfill our vision of creating a global community of movie enthusiasts!<span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'> </span></p>

<h2>Love Raters but low on budget? You can still help</h2>
<p>Don't worry, we still like you. But if you get the word out and make some noise about our campaign we will like you even more! :)</p>
<p>A wide coverage is a cornerstone of a successful campaign, so your ""share"" may be the one that does it for us! </p>
</div></div>","How it all started
Hello there!
We are Rasim, Teymur, and Tural - co-founders of Raters. 
As many of you, we love watching great movies, discovering new actors and directors, and, most importantly, sharing all of this with friends who share a similar passion for cinema. 
However, every attempt to watch something new would be accompanied by questions such as ""What should we watch?"", ""What was the movie Emily was talking about?"", ""What would Pedro say about this film?"" and so on...
...and, yes, this would take hours. 
To solve this issue for ourselves and for all the movie enthusiasts out there, we decided to create an app that would allow users to connect with people whose taste they trust and have their movie reviews and Watchlists all in one place. In other words - to create Raters.   

 
Didn't you guys just reinvent the wheel?
With so many movie platforms like IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and Netflix, why do we need another one? The answer is simple - your friends. If you think about it, quite frequently good movie recommendations emerge from your conversations with friends and acquaintances.
The key difference between Raters and conventional movie platforms is its focus on the social aspect and interaction between movie enthusiasts. Raters allows you to see what movies your friends have watched recently, how they rated them and what they thought about them. Besides, you can like and comment on their reviews, facilitating further discussion, which may lead you to your new favourite movie.
Raters:
Why do we exist?
We have an ambitious aim to help develop the film industry, and our goals can be categorised into two broad areas:
1. For users, we seek to create a global community of movie lovers where they can share their experiences and find movies that they will enjoy.
2. For independent studios and directors, we seek to create a platform where they can find their relevant audiences, who are most likely to be interested in their films. 
Why this campaign is so important for us
It has been a long and rocky (but also a super-fun) road from the day the idea was conceived. 
Today we have a fully working version of our app on the App Store (and we would love to hear your feedback!)
What we also have is an avalanche of ideas we would like to test and implement to enhance user experience. Your support would allow us to realize our ambitions and to fulfill our vision of creating a global community of movie enthusiasts! 
Campaign Goal
In short, we plan to target our efforts and funding on developing app functionality and adding new features. Based on existing users' feedback, these will include:
1. TrailersWatch trailers of new releases without leaving the app
2. Actors and Directors NavigationSearch for trending actors or films by your favourite directors
3. Extension to AndroidDownload Raters on Google Play and start following friends who use Android(We are also keen to release a Web version if we exceed our target!)
4. Groundbreaking Recommendation System (!)
OK, hear us out here, because we really want you to understand what makes our recommendation system ground-breaking.
Imagine you are trying to get a recommendation from some conventional platform. In most, if not all, cases the result will be based on your previous ratings.
With Raters, you will receive suggestions based  on movies you rated, your preferred genres, actors, and directors, as well as tailored recommendations based on who you follow, whose posts you like and comment on, and even how closely your movie taste correlates.
Add those factors together, and your next perfect movie is only a couple clicks away.
We are still working on how this system will be implemented within the app. The way our team envisions it at the moment is a completely new screen (such as the draft design below), in which you can access movie recommendations individually tailored to you. This is still a work-in-progress but it will be perfected each time someone rates a movie.

 
Stretch Goals
While user experience remains the most important part of our project, we are also involved with filmmakers, studios and other stakeholders within the film industry.Therefore, we introduced the so-called ""Stretch Goal"" - additional milestones we set out in the event we exceed our funding target.

Engage British Film Institute (BFI) in our project. Collaboration with BFI will allow us to support BFI’s aim ""to champion diverse, bold and distinctive films and increase the audiences for them"". It is perfectly aligned to what we are hoping achieve at Raters. 
Cooperating with independent studios and directors with the aim of promoting their productions and supporting young talent. Our engagement with directors to date confirmed that they would be interested in Raters to help promote their films to their relevant audience and would thus would greatly optimise their Paper and Advertising (P&A) costs, especially in non-mainstream genres, such art-house, sci-fi and documentaries.

Our projections suggest that once we hit our target cash raised, we will be able to get started on all of the above. So if you're excited about Raters, all you need to do is - back us, buckle up, and join us for the ride!

<span>When it comes to 3D printing, one of the biggest questions was: cheap, or fast?
Most sub $300 3D printers are slow. They can print at around 30mm/s, maximum. That's not a big problem, as long as you don't want to print something over a few cubic centimetres. But if you want? Better get ready to grow grey hair.
<br/><br/>Of course, you can go for a multiple thousands of dollars machine, which will work fast, a precise. There are also DIY kits, for around $2-300, which can deliver a decent performance. But do you really want to tweak, calibrate, assemble, upgrade, and fine-tune your printer for hours, and then re-calibrate between every print?

<br/><br/>That's why we created AVOC.</span><br/>
</div> <div>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">AVOC is compact</h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460977282/CARP_3D_2_yxfpkr.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>
</p>
<p>While AVOC boasts an over 3L (183 cubic inches) build volume, it only 
measures 222*222*355mm, which means small footprint. The whole printer weights less than 3kg (6.61 lbs), making AVOC a real 
desktop 3D printer.<br/></p>
<br/><h2 style=""text-align: center;"">AVOC is fast</h2>

<br/>
<p>While It's more than three times faster than the other similarly priced desktop 3D printers. And it could be even faster, but since it's lightweight, we limited the maximal printing speed to 100mm/s, to avoid resonance. <br/></p>
<br/>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Enclosed build chamber</h2>
<p><br/></p>

<br/>
<p>AVOC features a completely enclosed build chamber. Not only does this keep the super hot nozzle away from children, pets, and flammable material, but it also helps to reduce the filaments smell, and it improves build quality drastically. It also helps to avoid breaking the print from a sudden air temperature change.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<br/><p>Not only do we use a completely enclosed build chamber, we also use low voltage components, and a full RGB LED feedback to indicate the hotend temperature.<br/></p>

<br/>
AVOC is a real CoreXY, not a H-bot. What does this mean? The effector
 is lightweight, and the horizontal motors don't move. This means, that 
each motor has to carry less than 100gramms, and most of the time they 
work in unison. CoreXY based builds are balanced, fast, and unlike 
H-bots they don't tend to bend. We found a way to eliminate the belt 
crossing, while minimising loads on the Y bearings. <br/><p><br/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">AVOC is simple</h2>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460987402/avoc_exploded_rxcicn.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>We found, that 
the main reason why 3D printers are expensive is the complexity, and the
 high number of parts used. Not only does this mean a bigger part cost, 
but it also increases labour time, and makes QC much harder. With AVOC, 
we tried to reduce part count as much as possible. For example: we 
incorporated the Z axis bearing housing, the electronics housing, the 
filament holder, and the extruder housing in one part. This only reduced
 the assembly time by over 30 minutes per printer.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Non-propietary filament</h2>

<br/>
<p>AVOC uses non propietary, 1.75mm diameter filament. It's filament compartment can store one standard 1kg roll, up to 200mm diameter. This allows you to keep using the filament you like, or buy filament at the local 3D printer store!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">""QC passed"" is NOT a sticker. <br/>
</h2>
<p>And this goes for both electronics, the power supply, hotend, and mechanical parts. User experience depends greatly on the number of problems one experiences with a product, and our aim for this number is 0. For this, we developed a fast, and reliable method for checking if all manufactured AVOCs meet our quality requirements.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">We talked about what AVOC is... But how did we achieve this?</h2>First a little bit about how the production costs usually build up. Let's take a generic, $500 Cartesian 3D printer as an example. These use a ramps board, with a4988 stepper drivers, and nema 17 motors. Usually with a knock off hotend. Let's assume it has a frame assembled out of aluminium extrusions. Usually it takes 4 hours to assemble one of these printers. The cost breakdown will be something like this:<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460987825/avg_printer_cost_jklk21.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 601.667px;height: 361px;""/></p>
<p>As you can see, the most expensive parts are the frame, the electronics, the steppers, and the assembly.</p>
<h2>So we started reducing the costs:</h2>
<h3>Mechanics:<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460988495/stepper_comparison_omymp3.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>We use cheaper steppers where high torque and high speed is not necessary. The CoreXY allows us to use less expensive NEMA17 steppers on the X-Y axes, becouse they stay in place, so both the X, and Y carriage are lightweight. The two carriages together weigh less than 100 gramms.</p>
<h3>Frame:</h3>
<p>Our printer uses a polycarbonate frame, which costs an extremely low amount of money. We can't post a picture of that, as we want to keep the exact how to a secret. Let's just say it's not the trivial solution.</p>
<h3>Custom parts:<br/>
</h3>
<p>AVOC has almost all parts custom made. The only exceptions are the bearings, linear rails, motors, and the timing belts (yeah, the fasteners too). This allowed us to reduce the part count to an incredibly low number. Just the above mentioned filament compartment reduced the part count by 4. Our main mechanics are similar to this. We use a single piece for the X-Y (A-B) motors, the Z bearings, and the idlers.</p>
<h3>Commercial grade parts:</h3>
<p> We could manufacture parts with extremely high precision, but that would cost a fortune. Instead, we decided to use commercial tolerances, which would lead to lower quality.... but they won't. Why? Because we designed AVOC with our mind full of tolerance calculations. This led us to a design, which actually eliminates all play where it would impact print quality. This means, that the cover of the filament tray might have a little play, or the fan can be positioned 0.4mm off, as it won't cause failed prints, but the bearings have no play. And they won't wear fast, don't worry about that.</p>
<h3>Heated bed, and hotend:</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460989463/AVOC_3D_effector_qr5mvz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>We don't have a heated bed. Now you might ask: but why did you place that roll of ABS inside the printer in the video? Doesn't that require heated bed to stick? The answer is no, it doesn't. ABS sticks well to our bed material, and it's a commercially available plastic. So if anything would happen to your printbed, you can replace it easily. <br/></p>
<p>Our hotend is a custom one. This is the only part not cheaper than most j-head knock-offs. It's actually more expensive. Now you might say ""whoa, but why would you do that?"". The answer is weight. We spare more on the weight reduction, than the hotend costs. And it's necessary for our high performance. We need active cooling, but with these small dimensions we need a really good heat distribution too to achieve the high printing speed.</p>
<h3>Electronics:</h3>
<p>We have it custom made. A multiple board solution wouldn't be reliable enough, and most boards have too much features we wouldn't use, but still have to pay for. For example: we don't need 6 endstop connectors, or heatbed temperature sensor. This is a great reduction in cost, and high reliability improvement.</p>
<h3>Last, but not least, the assembly costs:</h3>
<p>Our printer will be assembled inside the EU. This would usually mean high manufacturing costs, but we designed AVOC for manufacturing. Our colleagues building the printers won't have to solder wires standing on their head manipulating through a half inch hole. Let's just say AVOC is probably the fastest to assemble 3D printer.</p>

<p>Our team includes specialists in the field of marketing, mechanical engineering, mechatronics, and programming.

<p>We also have many advisers behind the scenes, who help us with realising our goals. <br/></p>
<br/><br/><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><br/></p>
<p>AVOC is a hardware, and hardware is hard. Until now, we only had a prototype printer, which is built by using different manufacturing methods than those intended to be used in the final version. The mass production units will use mould injected, extruded, and other mass manufactured parts, instead of the 3D printed ones we used in our prototype. This means, that they will have different properties, and they will need minor changes in order to deliver the high performance expected of them.<br/></p>
<h4>Manufacturing/lead times: <br/>
</h4>
<p>We know, that the parts of AVOC are manufacturable, and we have quotations for tooling, and manufacturing, and parts, but we also know, that getting them right takes time. And making changes takes even more time. <br/></p>
<h4>Sourcing :</h4>
<p> There is also a risk with sourcing. We designed AVOC with parts available from a wide range of suppliers, so all parts are always available in large quantities, however they have to be shipped to us so we can assemble them. And while shipping usually takes less than 60 days, there can always be delays. <br/></p>
<h4>Money management: <br/>
</h4>
<p>We have seen crowdfunding campaigns go south because of overspending. We left a safety margin for us, and we minimized the expenses.<br/></p>
<h4>All summed up: <br/>
</h4>
<p>We checked out, and analysed all mayor crowdfunding campaigns which run into problems. We are confident we will not make the same mistakes, and we can make AVOC happen. We set our delivery date to December, as we wanted to keep at least two months reserve, and we are confident to deliver by then. The same goes for our $200 000 campaign goal. Sure, $100 000 would look better, but then there wouldn't be any reserve should anything happen. We will also keep our spendings as open as possible, and keep you informed!<br/>

Most sub $300 3D printers are slow. They can print at around 30mm/s, maximum. That's not a big problem, as long as you don't want to print something over a few cubic centimetres. But if you want? Better get ready to grow grey hair.
Of course, you can go for a multiple thousands of dollars machine, which will work fast, a precise. There are also DIY kits, for around $2-300, which can deliver a decent performance. But do you really want to tweak, calibrate, assemble, upgrade, and fine-tune your printer for hours, and then re-calibrate between every print?

That's why we created AVOC.
 
AVOC is compact




While AVOC boasts an over 3L (183 cubic inches) build volume, it only 
measures 222*222*355mm, which means small footprint. The whole printer weights less than 3kg (6.61 lbs), making AVOC a real 
desktop 3D printer.
AVOC is fast






While It's more than three times faster than the other similarly priced desktop 3D printers. And it could be even faster, but since it's lightweight, we limited the maximal printing speed to 100mm/s, to avoid resonance. 

Enclosed build chamber



AVOC features a completely enclosed build chamber. Not only does this keep the super hot nozzle away from children, pets, and flammable material, but it also helps to reduce the filaments smell, and it improves build quality drastically. It also helps to avoid breaking the print from a sudden air temperature change.



AVOC is safe


Not only do we use a completely enclosed build chamber, we also use low voltage components, and a full RGB LED feedback to indicate the hotend temperature.

AVOC is CoreXY



AVOC is a real CoreXY, not a H-bot. What does this mean? The effector
 is lightweight, and the horizontal motors don't move. This means, that 
each motor has to carry less than 100gramms, and most of the time they 
work in unison. CoreXY based builds are balanced, fast, and unlike 
H-bots they don't tend to bend. We found a way to eliminate the belt 
crossing, while minimising loads on the Y bearings. 
AVOC is simple



We found, that 
the main reason why 3D printers are expensive is the complexity, and the
 high number of parts used. Not only does this mean a bigger part cost, 
but it also increases labour time, and makes QC much harder. With AVOC, 
we tried to reduce part count as much as possible. For example: we 
incorporated the Z axis bearing housing, the electronics housing, the 
filament holder, and the extruder housing in one part. This only reduced
 the assembly time by over 30 minutes per printer.
Non-propietary filament



AVOC uses non propietary, 1.75mm diameter filament. It's filament compartment can store one standard 1kg roll, up to 200mm diameter. This allows you to keep using the filament you like, or buy filament at the local 3D printer store!

""QC passed"" is NOT a sticker. 

And this goes for both electronics, the power supply, hotend, and mechanical parts. User experience depends greatly on the number of problems one experiences with a product, and our aim for this number is 0. For this, we developed a fast, and reliable method for checking if all manufactured AVOCs meet our quality requirements.

We talked about what AVOC is... But how did we achieve this?First a little bit about how the production costs usually build up. Let's take a generic, $500 Cartesian 3D printer as an example. These use a ramps board, with a4988 stepper drivers, and nema 17 motors. Usually with a knock off hotend. Let's assume it has a frame assembled out of aluminium extrusions. Usually it takes 4 hours to assemble one of these printers. The cost breakdown will be something like this:

<p>
    We are a relatively small team of technology enthusiasts and SmartWatch experts.
    Because you need more than just a few techies to develop a SmartWatch though, we partnered with some of the most innovative companies in the industry.
    However, we are still looking for brilliant minds to expand the OXY team!
    If you’re a software developer or an electrical engineer, and you’d like to work with us in our office in Bristol, make sure you contact us!

<p>
    The OXY SmartWatch is designed to be the first SmartWatch that truly looks like a watch!
    We used the most advanced hardware solutions available and an Android powered operating system that was developed specifically for wearable devices.
</p>
<p>
    In collaboration with Ingenic Semiconductors, we have designed a SmartWatch that promotes the open source ideology,
    virtually works with every smart phone,
    is made of only high-quality materials, and - most importantly - looks and feels amazing on your wrist.
</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.oxytechs.com/Content/Images/IndieGogo/What_is_the_oxy.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
    OXY is beautifully crafted and comes in two shapes - Round and Square - and in two colors - Black and Silver.
    All models are, besides the different shape, identical in terms of hardware and software.
    All versions of OXY are equipped with high-resolution AMOLED displays and super-durable Corning Gorilla Glass.
</p>
<p>
    To ensure that OXY satisfies even the highest quality standards, we decided to manufacture it using CNC finished 316L Stainless Steel - the same material used by established watch makers such as Tissot, Omega and Gran Seiko.
    It provides OXY with a high resistance against sweat and corrosion and also creates a very elegant look.

    OXY works with custom WatchFaces that can be changed easily according to your mood.
    You can download new WatchFaces for free and the 8GB memory enables you to install all of your favorite ones without running out of space.
</p>
<p>
    We are collaborating with multiple graphic designers and WatchFace-makers to assure that there will be a large selection of WatchFaces
    openly available when you receive your OXY.

<p>
    OXY makes monitoring your health and your fitness level as easy as it can be.
    You can use OXY to check and monitor your heart rate, or you can take it a step further and analyze the calories you burned, the miles you ran and the time you spent for each exercise.
    All data OXY collects can easily be transferred to your phone and shared with Google Fit - or any of your favorite fitness applications.
</p>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""360"" src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/145045648?color=f9b142&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0"" width=""640""></iframe></div>
<p>
    With the OXY phone app you can receive calls, send a response to a missed call and speak through the microphone in your watch.
    While all features are embedded, you can choose which ones suit you and disable the rest.
</p>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""360"" src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/145048531?color=f9b142&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0"" width=""640""></iframe></div>
<p>
    When using a SmartWatch, your smart phone notifications are probably the most relevant information that can be displayed, which is why we put a lot of emphasis on them when developing OXY.
    You can select which apps can send notifications to your wrist and which ones can not.
    Plus, we created a notification system that is easy to understand - whether you are an expert or OXY is your first SmartWatch.
</p>
<div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""640"" src=""https://player.vimeo.com/video/145048970?color=f9b142&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0"" width=""640""></iframe></div>
<p>
    Some of the most important notifications are calendar and task reminders.
    That is why OXY can display all appointments and tasks available on your phone's calendar, send custom reminders and notify you when needed.
    Additionally, OXY is equipped with a set of speakers and a vibration motor, which you can configure according to your preferences.
</p>
<p>
    You'd like to talk to your watch or even have more interaction?
    Using OXY's integrated voice control feature, you can execute searches, dictate text and even activate applications without any effort and without even using your smart phone.
    We are actively working with Microsoft to implement their intelligent personal assistant software Cortana and their language and visual Artificial Intelligence OXFORD to make OXY the smartest Smartwatch on the market!

    OXY is based on an open source philosophy and powered by Android™ and ELF OS.
    Therefore, there are already countless applications available on the market, with the number of apps growing every day.
    We work closely with the best Android developers around the world to deliver even more custom apps that you can use with your OXY.
</p>
<p>
    ELF OS has already been adopted in Asia and, in collaboration with Ingenic Semiconductors, we have developed a custom version that will boost the adaptation of the innovative wearable operating system.
</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""http://www.oxytechs.com/Content/Images/IndieGogo/Application_available.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><span style=""font-size: 12px;""><em>This is just a small list of what is already available for ELF OS.</em></span></p>
<p>
    In addition to touch and voice control, OXY also comes with a gesture detection feature.
    This makes it easy to interact with your applications and also to turn OXY on and off.
    To make sure that everyone can use gesture control, it can be activated with your right and your left hand.
</p>

<p>
    At this point, OXY has been in development for over one year.
    We partnered up with multiple established hardware manufacturers to achieve the most durable and well-designed result.
</p>
<p>
    We started with the PCB (circuit board) and went on to testing multiple display solutions (AMOLED, LCD, TFT).
    We then partnered with Ingenic Semiconductors and designed a complete Developer Kit, which allowed for a much faster and more efficient prototyping process.
</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.oxytechs.com/Content/Images/IndieGogo/Prototypes.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
    The OXY Smartwatch is powered by a high performance Ingenic M200 microchip created specifically for wearable devices. <br/>
    Ingenic M200 features an innovative, energy-saving architecture that is based on a dual-core XBurst processor where one high-performance CPU runs at 1.2 GHz while one low-power CPU runs at 300 MHz.
    M200 also includes a fully-featured multimedia subsystem which integrates dedicated graphics, video and imaging engines.
    You can read more about the M200 <a href=""http://blog.imgtec.com/mips-processors/mips-based-ingenic-m200-chip-and-newton2-platform-wearables-and-iot"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this blog article</a> from imagination.<br/>
    Ingenic xburst cpus are built using the <a href=""http://imgtec.com/mips/architectures/mips32/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">MIPS32 architecture</a> designed by Imagination Technologies.<br/>
    Imagination is a global technology leader whose broad range of silicon ip (mips, powervr, ensigma) has been used to create the socs that power many iconic mobile, consumer and embedded electronics.
    The imagination community includes companies such as AllWinner technology, Amazon, Apple, Broadcom, Google, Intel, Mediatek, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Rockchip, Samsung, Sony, Tsmc, Toshiba and many others.

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""http://www.oxytechs.com/Content/Images/IndieGogo/IMGTEC.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
    OXY is equipped with standard smart phone and tablet chips and sensors, such as a gyroscope, an accelerometer, Bluetooth and WiFi chips, and many more.
</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.oxytechs.com/Content/Images/IndieGogo/Technical_Table.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
    To ensure that OXY can truly be your daily companion, we wanted to make it possible to use it under any circumstances that you would also use your traditional watch under.
    We tested OXY under the shower and many other conventional places to test its limits.
</p>
<p>
    As a result, we certified OXY to be IP67 water resistant.
    This means you can use your OXY under the shower, at the beach or when you wash your car, but not for diving and similar activities - at least for now.
</p>
<p>
    One of the toughest challenges we had to overcome during the development of OXY was finding the best possible charging system. <br/>
    Some SmartWatches use NFC charging technology (also known as 'wireless charging' or 'inductive charging') to supply their device with power.
    The biggest disadvantage of such a solution is the lack of connectivity between the watch and your computer and the extra space required to host the NFC module.
    NFC charging does not allow for a USB connection mode, which is very important for OXY's open source development.
</p>
<p>
    Now you probably ask yourself: Why not a physical USB port?
    We wanted to make OXY the first SmartWatch that genuinely looks and feels like a traditional watch, which is why it was very important to us that OXY is water resistant.
    A physical USB port drastically reduces the water resistance of any SmartWatch and was therefore not an option.
</p>
<p>
    To solve both issues, we decided to power OXY using a magnetic charging solution.
    Similar to other watch makers, such as Huawei, Pebble and LG, we realized the potential of magnetic charging for developers, while also ensuring IP67 water resistance for your OXY.
</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""http://www.oxytechs.com/Content/Images/IndieGogo/Chargers.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
    To provide an alternative charging system for the OXY SmartWatch, we also developed a Docking Station, which can be ordered separately during this campaign.
    Besides providing OXY with a safe place to be stored, it makes charging your watch while you sleep or work at your desk much more convenient. <br/>
    Initially, the OXY Docking Station was designed to allow for a more convenient way for developers to create and test their software for OXY.
    However, after using the Docking Station for a while our
    realized that it can be useful for everyone - not only our developers.
</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""http://www.oxytechs.com/Content/Images/IndieGogo/Docks.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<hr/>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-pin-nopin=""true"" data-src=""http://www.oxytechs.com/Content/Images/IndieGogo/Software.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
    We believe that a good SmartWatch deserves an operating system that is designed specifically for wearable devices to ensure that all potential features of the device can be used.<br/>
    At the same time, however, we wanted to use an operating system that works with every smart phone, that can be configured very flexibly depending on your preferences, and that makes it possible to share our code with the global developer community - in other words, to make it Open Source.
</p>
<p>
    This is why OXY is running on ELF OS (Android Lollipop 5.1.1) and IWDS SDK, which provide developers with comprehensive sets of APIs to make the interaction between your smartphone and your OXY as effortless as possible.<br/>
    We wanted to achieve maximum compatibility, which means that you can use OXY with any device running Android 4.3 KitKat (or higher), iOS 8.0 (or higher) and Windows 10!
    In order to work with OXY, your smartphone only needs to be able to establish a Bluetooth connection and have the OXY Companion App installed.
</p>
<p>
    To make sure that even the most complex WatchFaces can be run by OXY's ELF OS, we integrated a strong, specially dedicated GPU.
    By using the OXY Companion App and our free OXY marketplace, you can easily download your favorite WatchFaces directly to your OXY SmartWatch.
</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.oxytechs.com/Content/Images/IndieGogo/Watchfaces.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
    The most important aspect of any SmartWatch operating system is the way you can navigate through the different menus and functions.
    While all notifications need to be available instantly, they should also not distract you from your important tasks or cost you too much time to find.
</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.oxytechs.com/Content/Images/IndieGogo/Swipe-Gestures.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
    The OXY interface navigation system is designed using the X3 concept, which was originally created by LokiFish, one of our most dedicated community members.
    The X3 concept guarantees that it will never take you longer than three steps to activate any function or application on your OXY SmartWatch!<br/>
    The concept is simple: never take <em>more than 3 steps</em> to achieve something.
    With this concept we have created a smart home launcher capable to achieve any operation with maximum 3 steps.
</p>
<p>
    In the following section, you can check out a sample configuration of the X3 navigation principle.
    When customizing your OXY, you can use the companion app to assign different applications and functions to each gesture, based on your personal preferences.
</p>
<h3 style=""font-weight: 200 !important;"">

<p>
    Swiping down on your OXY display activates the Device Summary and the Quick Access function.
    These two applications are used to grant you a quick, easy-to-find overview of your OXY's and your phone's status.
    You can use this overview, for example, to interact with your favorite media player, change the luminosity of your phone and your watch, access your most recent notifications and monitor the battery status of both of your devices.
</p>

    The OXY SmartWatch was created with our developers' needs and preferences in mind.
    We wanted to create a SmartWatch that truly represents the open source ideology and makes it easy to develop applications and WatchFaces.
    This is why OXY is IDE (Integrated Development Environment) friendly and comes with the full source code of our Android ROM, available for download on BitBucket.
    You can use either Eclipse or Android Studio to create custom WatchFaces and applications - OXY supports both!
</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.oxytechs.com/Content/Images/IndieGogo/oxy-android.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
    Thanks to our extensive collaboration with Ingenic Semiconductors, we could release a fully descriptive, free-to-download API documentation.
    We want everybody to be able to create their own WatchFaces and apps, which is why we are working on providing tutorials and articles explaining how to code for OXY.
</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://www.oxytechs.com/Content/Images/IndieGogo/oxy-api.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</h3>
<p>
    Android™ is an open-source operating system, developed by Google, which is used to power many of the latest smartphones and tablets. The full name of Android™ is AOSP, which stands for Android™ Open Source Platform.<br/>
    ELF OS is a set of APIs and applications, which is built on top of AOSP 5.1.1 Lollipop. This means that ELF OS is a so-called Android ROM, a customized version of the standard Android™ system, which is specifically designed for wearable technologies and SmartWatch screens. <br/>
    ELF OS is maintained by the OXY team and by Ingenic Semiconductors. It is entirely open source, customizable and documented, so anybody can download the source code.
</p>
<h3 style=""font-weight: 200 !important; color: #40485E;"">
    Will OXY receive <span style=""color: #f9b142 !important;"">updates</span> after the campaign?
</h3>
<p>
    Yes! As soon as there is a new feature, patch or OS version for your OXY, we will release it to our community. You can install them using a direct connection to your computer or by using the OXY Companion App (available for Android, iOS and Windows). In the future, you might also be able to directly update your OXY through your WiFi connection.
</p>
<h3 style=""font-weight: 200 !important; color: #40485E;"">
    Can I <span style=""color: #f9b142 !important;"">Jailbreak</span> my OXY?

Free applications and WatchFaces will be available online using the OXY companion app
Now we need your help to make the OXY SmartWatch a reality!





    We are a relatively small team of technology enthusiasts and SmartWatch experts.
    Because you need more than just a few techies to develop a SmartWatch though, we partnered with some of the most innovative companies in the industry.
    However, we are still looking for brilliant minds to expand the OXY team!
    If you’re a software developer or an electrical engineer, and you’d like to work with us in our office in Bristol, make sure you contact us!








    The OXY SmartWatch is designed to be the first SmartWatch that truly looks like a watch!
    We used the most advanced hardware solutions available and an Android powered operating system that was developed specifically for wearable devices.


    In collaboration with Ingenic Semiconductors, we have designed a SmartWatch that promotes the open source ideology,
    virtually works with every smart phone,
    is made of only high-quality materials, and - most importantly - looks and feels amazing on your wrist.



    OXY is beautifully crafted and comes in two shapes - Round and Square - and in two colors - Black and Silver.
    All models are, besides the different shape, identical in terms of hardware and software.
    All versions of OXY are equipped with high-resolution AMOLED displays and super-durable Corning Gorilla Glass.


    To ensure that OXY satisfies even the highest quality standards, we decided to manufacture it using CNC finished 316L Stainless Steel - the same material used by established watch makers such as Tissot, Omega and Gran Seiko.
    It provides OXY with a high resistance against sweat and corrosion and also creates a very elegant look.


In Summary

Open Source PlatformOXY OS is available on BitBucket and can be fully customized

Battery2 days or more in Ambient Mode5 days or more in Standby Mode (not paired with a Phone) 






    OXY works with custom WatchFaces that can be changed easily according to your mood.
    You can download new WatchFaces for free and the 8GB memory enables you to install all of your favorite ones without running out of space.


    We are collaborating with multiple graphic designers and WatchFace-makers to assure that there will be a large selection of WatchFaces
    openly available when you receive your OXY.



    OXY makes monitoring your health and your fitness level as easy as it can be.
    You can use OXY to check and monitor your heart rate, or you can take it a step further and analyze the calories you burned, the miles you ran and the time you spent for each exercise.
    All data OXY collects can easily be transferred to your phone and shared with Google Fit - or any of your favorite fitness applications.



    With the OXY phone app you can receive calls, send a response to a missed call and speak through the microphone in your watch.
    While all features are embedded, you can choose which ones suit you and disable the rest.



    When using a SmartWatch, your smart phone notifications are probably the most relevant information that can be displayed, which is why we put a lot of emphasis on them when developing OXY.
    You can select which apps can send notifications to your wrist and which ones can not.
    Plus, we created a notification system that is easy to understand - whether you are an expert or OXY is your first SmartWatch.



    Some of the most important notifications are calendar and task reminders.
    That is why OXY can display all appointments and tasks available on your phone's calendar, send custom reminders and notify you when needed.
    Additionally, OXY is equipped with a set of speakers and a vibration motor, which you can configure according to your preferences.


    You'd like to talk to your watch or even have more interaction?
    Using OXY's integrated voice control feature, you can execute searches, dictate text and even activate applications without any effort and without even using your smart phone.
    We are actively working with Microsoft to implement their intelligent personal assistant software Cortana and their language and visual Artificial Intelligence OXFORD to make OXY the smartest Smartwatch on the market!

    OXY is based on an open source philosophy and powered by Android™ and ELF OS.
    Therefore, there are already countless applications available on the market, with the number of apps growing every day.
    We work closely with the best Android developers around the world to deliver even more custom apps that you can use with your OXY.


    ELF OS has already been adopted in Asia and, in collaboration with Ingenic Semiconductors, we have developed a custom version that will boost the adaptation of the innovative wearable operating system.


This is just a small list of what is already available for ELF OS.

    In addition to touch and voice control, OXY also comes with a gesture detection feature.
    This makes it easy to interact with your applications and also to turn OXY on and off.
    To make sure that everyone can use gesture control, it can be activated with your right and your left hand.





    At this point, OXY has been in development for over one year.
    We partnered up with multiple established hardware manufacturers to achieve the most durable and well-designed result.


    We started with the PCB (circuit board) and went on to testing multiple display solutions (AMOLED, LCD, TFT).
    We then partnered with Ingenic Semiconductors and designed a complete Developer Kit, which allowed for a much faster and more efficient prototyping process.



    The OXY Smartwatch is powered by a high performance Ingenic M200 microchip created specifically for wearable devices. 
    Ingenic M200 features an innovative, energy-saving architecture that is based on a dual-core XBurst processor where one high-performance CPU runs at 1.2 GHz while one low-power CPU runs at 300 MHz.
    M200 also includes a fully-featured multimedia subsystem which integrates dedicated graphics, video and imaging engines.
    You can read more about the M200 this blog article from imagination.
    Ingenic xburst cpus are built using the MIPS32 architecture designed by Imagination Technologies.
    Imagination is a global technology leader whose broad range of silicon ip (mips, powervr, ensigma) has been used to create the socs that power many iconic mobile, consumer and embedded electronics.
    The imagination community includes companies such as AllWinner technology, Amazon, Apple, Broadcom, Google, Intel, Mediatek, Microsoft, Qualcomm, Rockchip, Samsung, Sony, Tsmc, Toshiba and many others.



    OXY is equipped with standard smart phone and tablet chips and sensors, such as a gyroscope, an accelerometer, Bluetooth and WiFi chips, and many more.



    To ensure that OXY can truly be your daily companion, we wanted to make it possible to use it under any circumstances that you would also use your traditional watch under.
    We tested OXY under the shower and many other conventional places to test its limits.


    As a result, we certified OXY to be IP67 water resistant.
    This means you can use your OXY under the shower, at the beach or when you wash your car, but not for diving and similar activities - at least for now.


    One of the toughest challenges we had to overcome during the development of OXY was finding the best possible charging system. 
    Some SmartWatches use NFC charging technology (also known as 'wireless charging' or 'inductive charging') to supply their device with power.
    The biggest disadvantage of such a solution is the lack of connectivity between the watch and your computer and the extra space required to host the NFC module.
    NFC charging does not allow for a USB connection mode, which is very important for OXY's open source development.


    Now you probably ask yourself: Why not a physical USB port?
    We wanted to make OXY the first SmartWatch that genuinely looks and feels like a traditional watch, which is why it was very important to us that OXY is water resistant.
    A physical USB port drastically reduces the water resistance of any SmartWatch and was therefore not an option.


    To solve both issues, we decided to power OXY using a magnetic charging solution.
    Similar to other watch makers, such as Huawei, Pebble and LG, we realized the potential of magnetic charging for developers, while also ensuring IP67 water resistance for your OXY.



    To provide an alternative charging system for the OXY SmartWatch, we also developed a Docking Station, which can be ordered separately during this campaign.
    Besides providing OXY with a safe place to be stored, it makes charging your watch while you sleep or work at your desk much more convenient. 
    Initially, the OXY Docking Station was designed to allow for a more convenient way for developers to create and test their software for OXY.
    However, after using the Docking Station for a while our
    realized that it can be useful for everyone - not only our developers.





    We believe that a good SmartWatch deserves an operating system that is designed specifically for wearable devices to ensure that all potential features of the device can be used.
    At the same time, however, we wanted to use an operating system that works with every smart phone, that can be configured very flexibly depending on your preferences, and that makes it possible to share our code with the global developer community - in other words, to make it Open Source.


    This is why OXY is running on ELF OS (Android Lollipop 5.1.1) and IWDS SDK, which provide developers with comprehensive sets of APIs to make the interaction between your smartphone and your OXY as effortless as possible.
    We wanted to achieve maximum compatibility, which means that you can use OXY with any device running Android 4.3 KitKat (or higher), iOS 8.0 (or higher) and Windows 10!
    In order to work with OXY, your smartphone only needs to be able to establish a Bluetooth connection and have the OXY Companion App installed.


    To make sure that even the most complex WatchFaces can be run by OXY's ELF OS, we integrated a strong, specially dedicated GPU.
    By using the OXY Companion App and our free OXY marketplace, you can easily download your favorite WatchFaces directly to your OXY SmartWatch.



    The most important aspect of any SmartWatch operating system is the way you can navigate through the different menus and functions.
    While all notifications need to be available instantly, they should also not distract you from your important tasks or cost you too much time to find.



    The OXY interface navigation system is designed using the X3 concept, which was originally created by LokiFish, one of our most dedicated community members.
    The X3 concept guarantees that it will never take you longer than three steps to activate any function or application on your OXY SmartWatch!
    The concept is simple: never take more than 3 steps to achieve something.
    With this concept we have created a smart home launcher capable to achieve any operation with maximum 3 steps.


    In the following section, you can check out a sample configuration of the X3 navigation principle.
    When customizing your OXY, you can use the companion app to assign different applications and functions to each gesture, based on your personal preferences.


Swipe Right



    Swiping right will activate OXY's Navigation.
    It will give you map directions without the need of taking your smartphone out of your pocket.
    This is really helpful, especially when you are on your scooter or bike.


Swipe Left



    By swiping left, you can access the Notification Timeline of your OXY SmartWatch.
    This screen displays all your phone's notifications and, of course, you can easily configure which app's notifications you will see in your Notification Timeline.
    You can see the details of each notification and interact with them by simply tapping them on your screen.


Swipe Up



    When you swipe up, your OXY will start the integrated Phone application.
    This app allows you to keep track of your call history, grants access to your phone's contacts and also lets you start and accept phone calls.


Swipe Down



    Swiping down on your OXY display activates the Device Summary and the Quick Access function.
    These two applications are used to grant you a quick, easy-to-find overview of your OXY's and your phone's status.
    You can use this overview, for example, to interact with your favorite media player, change the luminosity of your phone and your watch, access your most recent notifications and monitor the battery status of both of your devices.


Long Tap



    A long tap (holding) on the display of your OXY, while the current WatchFace is visible, will activate the WatchFace manager.
    With this integrated application you can easily swap different WatchFaces and access the specific settings of each one of them!


Holding the Power Button



    Holding down the Power Button of your OXY will activate the main menu.
    Through OXY's menu, you can access your installed applications or change important settings of your watch, such as brightness, vibration, volume, WiFi, Bluetooth and many more.


Apps


    The OXY SmartWatch is powered by the custom operating system Android Lollipop 5.1.1 ELF OS.
    This will enable you to install any application developed for Android Lollipop by default.
    All you have to do, in case you backed the round version, is make sure that the application's user interface also supports a round display.


Check out this video of our Round prototype executing the famous Doodle Jump apps:










    The OXY SmartWatch was created with our developers' needs and preferences in mind.
    We wanted to create a SmartWatch that truly represents the open source ideology and makes it easy to develop applications and WatchFaces.
    This is why OXY is IDE (Integrated Development Environment) friendly and comes with the full source code of our Android ROM, available for download on BitBucket.
    You can use either Eclipse or Android Studio to create custom WatchFaces and applications - OXY supports both!



    Thanks to our extensive collaboration with Ingenic Semiconductors, we could release a fully descriptive, free-to-download API documentation.
    We want everybody to be able to create their own WatchFaces and apps, which is why we are working on providing tutorials and articles explaining how to code for OXY.



    In addition to the API documentation, we created an XDA community where you can discuss your results, get advice and feedback, or download all available materials, such as sample apps, to speed up your learning process.



    However, we did not just want to improve the way you can develop your own apps for OXY, we also wanted to limit the effort of sharing your apps and WatchFaces with the OXY community! 
    This is why we created a marketplace, where you can easily upload your software and download the ones other developers provided for free.




    Every donation gets us closer to bringing the OXY SmartWatch to life!
    We are grateful for every pledge and appreciate all the support we have received through our community so far. 
    You are the best!

    We have a clear plan in mind when it comes to the future development of OXY.
    Our vision is to create an open source wearables platform for developers and users alike.
    We are dedicated to keep you, our backers, involved during every step along the way!



    Our manufacturing system is already in place and we can produce a maximum of 20,000 to 50,000 units every month, starting in January 2016.
    After production, we will send all produced units to Bristol once a month to avoid high shipping costs.
    In the UK, we will control the quality of every OXY and manually package each unit, before sending it directly to you.
    We will start shipping your OXY between June 2016 and July 2016- No matter where in the world you are located!


    OXY will also have CE and FCC certifications, our PCB Design Company is already working on getting all the papers done before OXY will be delivered to your home.



    You will receive your very own OXY including the free Companion App.
    The app works with virtually any modern smartphone (only Bluetooth connectivity is required), whether it runs on Android™, iOS© or Windows 10.




        Our Software Roadmap does not include changes made by the Open Source community.
    




Net Architectures ltd.


    Our team at Net Architectures is based in Bristol and in charge of the software of your OXY.
    Our team members are not just in Bristol though, we are also based in Spain, Germany, Hungary, Turkey, Argentina and many other beautiful places.
    A special thank you goes to our designers Joao, Sebastian, Daniel and Karl, who have done an amazing job so far!



BitHussar


    Bithussar is our VFX partner! That means they made our amazing video footage and animations.



All In Mobile


    We’ve partnered with AllInMobile to develop the final companion app for iOS and Android.
    Their team has been an amazing help so far and we are looking forward to further develop OXY with them.



Ingenic Semiconductors


    Lastly, we'd like to thank the great team of Ingenic Semiconductors.
    They have worked very closely with us and shared their invaluable knowledge, trust and expertise during the entire process of making OXY come to life.







    Our team mainly consists of software developers and hardware enthusiasts, which is why we have a lot of experience with developing mobile applications and systems.
    We are working with established hardware manufacturers in Asia and our production process is already in place.
    Therefore, we can estimate the target shipping date very well and also know exactly how many OXY SmartWatches can be manufactured every month.


    OXY has gone through numerous tests and QA (quality assurance) sessions, which were done by our manufacturers in China and also by our team of software engineers.
    In addition, Ingenic Semiconductors has provided us with a custom Hardware Development Kit months ahead of this campaign, so we could precisely simulate how our hardware and software would work together.
    OXY™ is a Registered Trademark in the United Kingdom, while the MIPS M200 CPU is patented by Ingenic Semiconductors and IMGTEC.



    By following the open source ideology we also commit to the highest possible level of transparency.
    We will regularly keep you updated about any changes, developments and news. After all, you are the ones who are making the OXY SmartWatch possible!
    If you have any questions or concerns, you can always contact us through our social media channels and via email (support@oxytechs.com).




    How can I purchase OXY?


    OXY is only available on Indiegogo at the moment. By pre-ordering it through our campaign, you can save up to 35% towards the future retail price!


    What will the future price of OXY be?


    OXY’s final retail price will most likely be $299.


    Is OXY water proof?


    OXY is certified to be IP67 water resistant! This means that you can use OXY under the shower, at the beach or other occasions you’d also wear your traditional watch for. You can’t use OXY for diving or similar activities though - at least for now!


    Which smartphone operating system is OXY compatible with?


    You will be able to use your OXY in conjunction with phones running Android™ 4.3 (or higher), iOS© 8.0 (or higher) and Windows 10. That means you can use OXY with virtually any modern smartphone!


    What is Android™ and ELF OS?


    Android™ is an open-source operating system, developed by Google, which is used to power many of the latest smartphones and tablets. The full name of Android™ is AOSP, which stands for Android™ Open Source Platform.
    ELF OS is a set of APIs and applications, which is built on top of AOSP 5.1.1 Lollipop. This means that ELF OS is a so-called Android ROM, a customized version of the standard Android™ system, which is specifically designed for wearable technologies and SmartWatch screens. 
    ELF OS is maintained by the OXY team and by Ingenic Semiconductors. It is entirely open source, customizable and documented, so anybody can download the source code.


    Will OXY receive updates after the campaign?


    Yes! As soon as there is a new feature, patch or OS version for your OXY, we will release it to our community. You can install them using a direct connection to your computer or by using the OXY Companion App (available for Android, iOS and Windows). In the future, you might also be able to directly update your OXY through your WiFi connection.


    Can I Jailbreak my OXY?


    It already is, with some security precautions! You can download the entire source code of ELF OS through our developer website and customize it however you want. Then, using our Bootloader available for Ubuntu and Windows, you can easily install your own operating system or customize an existing one. There is no limit to what you can do!


    How do I connect OXY to my smartphone?


    OXY is equipped with a Bluetooth 4.1 (BLE) antenna, which can connect to Android, iOS and Windows. You can pair OXY with your smartphone by using the QR-code reader of the OXY Companion App. Simply scan your OXY’s QR-code and you’re ready to go!


    Can I change OXY's wristband?


    Yes! Because OXY is equipped with a standard 20/22mm LUG (depending on the model), you can use any standardized wristband with your OXY! You can order a selection of custom high quality wristbands from us, but it is compatible with most other available models as well. You can make OXY look any way you want!


    How can I charge my OXY?


    You can charge OXY using the custom magnetic charger. Simply attach it to the back of your OXY and plug the USB-side of your cable into your computer - or directly into the wall using the A/C adapter. If you are a developer, or if you just want to have a specific place to charge your OXY at, you can also use the specially designed OXY Dock. This way you can use the screen of your OXY while it is charging. Oh, and it also looks pretty good!


    Can I answers calls or text messages using OXY?


    Yes! You can reply to text messages using applications for SMS, Whatsapp, Hangouts and Facebook Messenger. We are also working on adding additional messaging platforms to ELF OS in the future. 
    When it comes to phone calls, you have two options: You can either use your OXY just like a traditional Bluetooth headset (using the integrated microphone and speakers), or you can answer using a configurable list of answers that will be sent to your caller as a text. You could, for example, send ‘I am in a meeting right now. I will call you back after‘ or ‘I am currently not available. Please try again tomorrow’. Of course, you can also just decline the call directly through your OXY.


    Which fitness app can I use with OXY?


    OXY has an integrated fitness application! However, we are also working in integrating popular health tracking apps like Google Fit, MyFitnessPal and RunKeeper.


    Do I need to add shipping costs to my pledge?


    When you select your region, Indiegogo will automatically add the corresponding shipping costs to your pledge.
    You can find the respective shipping costs in the table below.
    Before being sent to you, every package will be re-checked manually, and then provided with a tracking number and insurance from our courier DHL.
    We will start shipping your OXYs in June 2016.



    Do other costs apply to my pledge?


    OXY is classified as an electronic device. Some countries have import taxes for electronics, which are unfortunately not under our control. If you are not aware of the current legislation in your country, check out  this website to find the import tax for your country.
    Note that you’ll be importing from the United Kingdom and that the amount you have to declare is your total pledge, minus the shipping costs for your region.


    Is there a manufacturer warranty for OXY?


    Our manufacturer offers a one-year limited warranty on all hardware related issues. Every defective product will be analyzed by our Quality Assurance department and replaced with a new OXY, in case of any hardware defect.


    How can I choose which OXY I want?


After the campaign, we will send out a backer survey. In this survey you will be able to indicate whether you want the OXY Round, or the OXY Square. You can also choose the color of your OXY then.


    What if my question was not answered here?


    If you have any questions that were not answered in our FAQs or on our page, make sure to contact us through our social media channels or directly via email. You can reach us at support@oxytechs.com. We’re looking forward to hearing from you!

Initially, we were merely consumers of protector that protected LCD display of expensive smartphone. Recently the type of protector have also diversified, it is 2D and 3D in form, PET and PC materials including Glass are applied, and it seems that the printed 3D type protector is consumed.
However, we have been waiting for the protector of glass 3D full curved screen protector, and eventually it started to develop itself. Creating a protector similar to the curvature of a smart phone was a real challenge and we understood that these full cover was not easily produced during development.
Our start is now !!
The glass 3D full curved clear screen protector is call Omni-guard.
Everyone, please use our newly born Omni-guard to make many reviews and comments. Empowered by your encouragement, we will build a mass production system and offer Omni-guard to many consumer who love smartphone.
With the future trend of smartphone without a Bezel as the only tool for LCD display protection, Omni-guard protects your valuable and advanced smartphone in the luxurious from the outside harmful environment.
Remark) These photos used in this page are based on actual protectors.

 
Where ? & Members ?
Our team was a small  company specializing in the development of the Republic of Korea founded in 2012. It seems that it took more than a year to introduce Omni-guard. Our team will do our best to make consumers satisfied with better protections from now on.
Please keep a close eye on us.
 
Shipping & Delivery ?
Omni-guard can be shipped worldwide and will be dispatched late-June.

Simply remove the back panel and slide your credit card in for a night on the town! FLIP: Elevate the Appearance. The FLIP hides the presence of your device with the capability to store multiple cards with it. Cases with card slots are usually unreliable and bulky, but the FLIP case attaches directly to the NuAns NEO  [Reloaded]  blending in perfectly to the CORE. The self-standing FLIP was designed to feel as if it was part of the phone to begin with.We know it’s important to you to always bring your important cards and not to forget them. Based on our extensive experience in designing smartphone accessories, we noticed that most consumers prefer the flip-type case. So we came up with an unconventional exterior design called FLIP that has two card pockets and a large storage pocket, apart from the backside IC card storage space. It even doubles up as a hands-free stand ideal for watching movies. Aside from that, the smartphone automatically turns on when the FLIP lid is opened and goes to sleep mode when closed.  CORE: Styled by You.The CORE, the center of NuAns NEO, was designed on the concept that it can be integrated with the exterior of the phone. The CORE represents everything we wanted in a smartphone device while allowing you to personalize your device around the CORE. Hence, a little bit of us and a little bit of you!Just like changing into clothes every day, you can change the exterior depending on the application of the phone and style you desire. The exteriors are two separate panels that are artfully designed using different textures; seamlessly unifying the exterior to the body of the phone. Battery: Quick Charge Port with USB Type-C.The inner battery of the NuAns NEO [Reloaded] has a 3,540mAh capacity, which is approx.2 times larger capacity than iPhone (iPhone 7: 1,960mAh). Talk Time: 23 hrs approx. Standby time: 335 hrs approx. It is compatible with the newest quick charging technology “Quick Charge 3.0” from Qualcomm. The external battery charger can charge up to 70% within one hour.  Memory: Abundant Data Capacity.The basic specification of NEO matches up to the high-end devices. Main memory carries 3GB so that it can work smoothly using multiple Apps at the same time. The Inner Flash Memory has 32GB of storage. With up to 1TB MicroSD Card of extra storage, so there is no need to worry about taking too many pictures or long videos.   Awards: Recognition and Honors.The Nuans NEO's design was the recipient of the Good Design Award 2016 Best 100 and the iF Design Award 2017 Gold Award. Camera: Professional Grade Camera.The reputed Sony backside illuminated CMOS sensors is used for both the front and rear cameras of the NuAns NEO [Reloaded]. The rear camera combines a bright lens of F2.0 with a field angle equivalent to 28 mm which is easy to handle and a 13 megapixels sensor. By using the distance measurement of the Phase Detection Autofocus and the contrast detection function to high-speed contrast detection autofocus, it is possible to achieve high-speed and accurate autofocus and enjoy photography comfortably at any time. We combined an 8 megapixels sensor and a super wide angle lens of 24 mm / F2.2 which is optimum for selfies with the front camera. There is no doubt that it will be useful not only for pictures of yourself with a beautiful background but also for the group selfies with friends and family.  Durable: Water, Weather, Whatever. You may want to use NuAns NEO [Reloaded] when it starts to rain while you are out, while you’re cooking in the kitchen so you can look at a recipe, take pictures when you play the kids in a sandbox, or even just taking pictures near water. To fit these various kinds of life situations, NuAns NEO [Reloaded] has been developed to be Dust-Proof and Water-Resistant up to a IP54 standard.     BANDsNuAns NEO [Reloaded] Bands4G LTE: 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 12, 17, 18, 19, 26, 283G: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 192G: Quad Band (850/900/1800/1900) *This is for your reference only.

For both security control of information and safety when you use the device, the unlocking function of the biosensor is indispensable. In NuAns NEO [Reloaded], has adopted a fingerprint sensor to eliminate the inconvenience of entering a security passcode every time to make it easy to use.   Design: Structure is Key.Most of the manufacturing companies are pursuing the world's thinnest and lightest devices. However, those attributes are not the single answer to the ""greatest smartphone every made"".  NuAns NEO [Reloaded] has our favorite attributes of a smartphone woven deeply in its CORE, proposing a change to the new digital lifestyle.Q. Does the thinnest phone make it easier to handle and to perform daily functions? A. Not always.We wanted a device that had advanced tech in its CORE, yet provided convenient functionality when held in your hand. In lieu of seeking out the thinnest possible device, we substituted it with installing the latest technological advancements. We found that the NuAns NEO [Reloaded]'s 5.29 ounces was the perfect weight to its key attributes: comfortable handling, visually stunning, and functionally sound. Display: Crystal Clear Display.The display has a very narrow frame giving it a 5.2 inch full HD display from Sharp. The enlarged display area expands to the full width of the front cover glass, It is almost frameless. Corresponding to a wide color range, the high-definition and beautiful display reaches 428 ppi pixel density and 1920 x 1080 pixels, that has improved not just by specs, but also by using the best quality display.*iPhone 7:  Screen size 4.7 inches, Resolution 750 x 1334 pixels (~326 ppi pixel density) Screen: Indestructible Glass.NuAns NEO [Reloaded] adopted the latest model of Asahi Glass ""Dragontrail Pro"". Making it the first model in the world to tackle strengthening the cover glass while making full use of its characteristic rounded shape. Furthermore, the surface of the cover glass has an anti-fingerprint coating that helps suppress the reflection of light with high transparency.  The Word on NuAns NEO [Reloaded]. ""The NuAns NEO [Reloaded] is solid without feeling overly dense, and though it will stretch your pockets more than the average smartphone, you can...make it double as a wallet."" - Engadget""A welcome respite from the familiar-looking smartphones we have grown accustomed to over the years.."" - Digital Trends""What distinguishes NuAns NEO [Reloaded] from other smartphones on the market are the possibilities for customization..."" - Web News Concept: What is it?Using textures and colors, while maintaining basic functionality and looks, we reviewed current smart phone lifestyles to understand what obstacles prohibit the euphoria that we call “comfort” in everyday technology. The NuAns NEO [Reloaded]'s sole mission is to seek that solution to comfort; with the new answer. The more we can blend the digital life into the comfort of our space, the easier it is to find that new answer. What is a Comfortable Digital Life?Comfort is something everyone can relate to. We strive for comfort in what we wear, where we sleep, and how we live. We asked ourselves, how do we find comfort in our smart phone devices? To find the answer we had to dissect what turns people off of current smartphones.
The panic during the loss of battery life.
The bulky design making smart phones hard to handle.
The cold, metallic, slippery texture.
 Concept: Altering The Look.For a tool that becomes the basis of your daily routine, you want a device that would perfectly integrate with your life – both at work and at home. A device that can naturally fit in your hands; flawlessly connected to you forming an emotional attachment to it.  Every day,  you bring things such as a bag, watch, stationery, or wallet with you. It’s the same with a smartphone, you carry it with you all the time. Wouldn’t it be nice to customize the “texture” of your smartphone so that it fits naturally in your hand and match it with a color that suits your taste? We analyzed a person’s lifestyle and redesigned the smartphone from scratch while considering every detail such as color, material, texture and shape.  We sought out to design a device that blends into our hands and lifestyles by using natural materials which bring immediate comfort. In this new era, we have brought nuance to digital devices with new answers for our lifestyles. Texture: The Ultimate Feels.We wanted our main focus to be on the appearance and texture of the device. In addition to the daily functions of the device, we find ourselves simply holding it more often than not. For that reason, we decided that NuAns and the NuAns NEO series were going to bring aesthetics and texture to life.Aside from existing materials such as tennâge, clarino, and ultrasuede, we added four additional materials: cork, denim, dotted ultrasuede, and stone to complement to your ""texture"" sensation. This is our concept for NuAns NEO [Reloaded], to deliver genuine touch, texture, and color to your everyday hand-held device.  Software: Enhance Your Experience.NuAns NEO [Reloaded] adopted the newest Android 7.1 (Nougat). Using the Google Play Store you can make the most of all the different Android Apps. The Android system dominates the large market share all over the world, opening up a multitude of possibilities.   The Qualcomm newest chipset “Snapdragon 625” was adopted to the core. By combining this chipset with the inner battery of the NuAns NEO [Reloaded], it doubles the capacity of the iPhone and can run efficiently for long hours. Also, high-speed communication was achieved by the USB 3.0.  Specifications: The Nitty Gritty.
