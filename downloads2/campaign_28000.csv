<p>My name is Mary Ellen Bowen and I am the founder and director of Kids To The Country in Tennessee and am asking for your help with this important program. Using direct hands-on experience with 
nature, Kids To The Country offers urban kids a break from often troubled 
situations, and a chance to connect, perhaps for the first time, with 
the Earth and her rhythms . The children come from homeless shelters, low-income neighborhoods, 
refugee centers, and special needs cases, such as Hurricane Katrina 
survivors. Over  5,500 children have participated so far since the program's inception in 1986.<br/><br/>Along 
with its summer sessions, KTC has a winter program with activities that reinforce the skills the kids have learned, and 
help keep them connected to nature and each other through the year. Before the holiday, we have a gift-making workshop and Kwanzaa celebration, where 
the children get to make many presents for their friends and families-—and 
enjoy the feelings of confidence and self-worth that come from giving as
 well as receiving.  The Kwanzaa Celebration reminds them of good living principles and instructions all year long.<br/><br/>KTC gives these kids experiential education normally 
unavailable to them. We teach about the value of nonviolent conflict 
resolution and respect for cultural diversity. They learn about their 
relationship with their environment and are encouraged to consider 
themselves truly a resource with answers to our global concerns. They 
learn skills like gardening and cooking, horse care and riding, 
mediation, expressive crafts, solar science, and nature arts. Perhaps 
most importantly, they are listened to and encouraged for the positive 
contributions that they make.<br/><br/>Plenty International is a 
not-for-profit charitable organization based in Tennessee, founded by 
The Farm in 1974 for relief work and development. Kids To The Country 
originally began in 1978 in the South Bronx in New York, where Plenty 
operated a free ambulance service. Neighborhood children were regularly 
invited to  The Farm’s upstate New York branch, where they received 
obvious great benefit. When the Bronx ambulance project completed its 
goals in New York, Kids To The Country was re-established back in 
Tennessee in 1986. Plenty’s intentions have always been to increase 
local self-sufficiency and improve the quality of life among people, 
focusing on indigenous communities, children, and vigorous protection of
 the environment.<br/><br/>Kids To The Country is held on 1750 acres of 
woodlands, meadows, creeks, and hills belonging to The Farm Community in
 Lewis County, 75 miles south of Nashville near Summertown. Founded in 
1971, The Farm is a nonsectarian intentional community that is currently
 home to about 200 people. It has its own accredited alternative school,
 an international Ecovillage Training Center with emphasis on 
sustainable living, and multiple thriving businesses, as well as Plenty 
International’s headquarters. Since one of the primary values in KTC’s 
philosophy is respect for the environment, an important part of the 
program is learning about the incredible diversity of plant and animal 
life that abounds in this beautiful location. <br/><br/>KTC Mission<br/>Create a multicultural exchange in a rural setting for at-risk children.<br/>Build a positive sense of community through nonviolent conflict resolution skills.<br/>Promote the growth of healthful relationships with one another. <br/><br/>KTC

</div></div>","The people of Nepal need your support today Hi i'm Ben and I am working with the Colchester ex-Ghurka society to ship a huge amount of clothing, outdoor equipment and blankets to Nepal after the crisis this year. Just to add more issues to the disaster, the monsoon season has just begun, so it is crucial and very urgent to distribute aid to the most remote parts of Nepal before. This year's monsoon season is going to cause untold health issues and complications for the worst affected areas of Nepal and the worst hit areas happen to be the most remote, with the least aid! 
''Populations continue to live in temporary shelters with sub-optimal hygiene, sanitation and water conditions'' The World Health Organisation (WHO)
The Colchester ex-Ghurka society and myself we have collected a freight containers (20ft) worth of warm clothing (for babies, children and adults) and outdoor equipment including tents and blankets. We now need your support to ship these goods to Nepal, Kamandu airport from here in the UK. Jet airways have very kindly offered us a huge discount on shipping the goods by plane, which means the equipment will be on the ground within 24 hours and distributed within days.  .  
Your support is directly going to make the difference to someones life and will allow them to live a semi-normal style, while governments and NGO's can rebuild this devastated country.    What We Need & updates for you
We need to raise £5000 ($8000) in total to ship the equipment to Nepal, We will keep you in the loop every step of the way. We will email all supporters with updates on shipping the goods and the safe arrival in the storage unit in Nepal. We will then send you pictures of the equipment being distributed in the worst hit areas of Nepal.   

''Months after Nepal’s deadliest quake on record, people in this mountainous region about 100 miles northeast of Kathmandu say it is no longer the jolting aftershocks but the steady monsoon rains that present the biggest challenge'' Yahoo News

This is your chance to help
This is your chance to help a nation that are truly in need of our support for the coming years to come. The Nepalese people are some the kindest and honest people, so as soon as I saw the earthquake and devastation, I knew I had to do something and now I am hoping you can find the compassion to help make this project complete. Both Kumar and Samesti have been working tirelessly to collect this huge amount of aid equipement and to bring this project to a close. If you can imagine what it could be like to have nothing and then to be given simple things like clothes and blankets and how they would help, then please support this campaign today and donate something small or large, everything will help.




Extra funds
Any extra funds raised from this campaign will be used to buy simple sanitation equipment such as dysenteries, water purification tablets and basic medicinal equipment.  

Thank you!



Thank you so much for your support in helping our efforts and namaste.

<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Nepal is a developing country located in South Asia, located
between India and China. It is one of the poorest countries in the world, with the
majority of the population living below the poverty line. According to UNICEF,
""around 1.2 million Nepali children between the ages of five and 16 have
either never attended school or have dropped out. UNICEF's experience shows
that children who are out of school for extended periods, including during
emergencies, become less and less likely to ever return to the classroom.""</p>

On April 25, 2015, a massive earthquake of 7.8 magnitude on the Richter
scale struck Nepal, followed by a second major tremor, on May 12. The death
toll from the two quakes now stands at nearly 9,000, and more than half a
million homes, most of them in hard to reach rural areas, are uninhabitable.
The full scale of destruction is still being assessed, as search and rescue
teams reach remote areas affected by these earthquakes.

another two dozen between magnitude 4.5 and 5. U.S. Geological Survey predicts that
serious aftershocks could persist for at least a year. Many on the ground in
Nepal continue to report aftershocks, and many are still - living in tents and makeshift
shelters. </span><br/></p>

<p>The current education system of Nepal is one of the youngest in
the world. Most of the children in rural areas are not exposed to
proper education. The public school infrastructure and curriculum in rural
Nepal is in very poor condition.<span>  This
has been greatly affected, and magnified, by the recent earthquakes and
unstable situation.</span></p>
<p></p>
<h4><b>The Project in Detail</b></h4>
<p>According to a UNICEF report, at least 950,000 children in Nepal will not be able to return to school. “Almost one million children who were enrolled in school before the earthquake could now find they have no school building to return to,” said Tomoo Hozumi, UNICEF’s Representative in Nepal.  </p>
<p>
</p>
<p>Kavreplanchock (Kavre) District is one of the hard-hit areas by
the earthquake. Panauti-3 is a village in Kavre, and Bal Uddhar
Secondary School is the only public school in the village. It has been severely
damaged and deemed unsafe, unusable by the government of Nepal.</p>

<p>Before the earthquake there were 300-400 students attending Bal

<h4><u>School Reconstruction</u></h4>

<p>All of
the students are eager to learn. They are all from poor backgrounds, and mostly
from the lower, formerly untouchable caste. Most of their families work on
subsistence farms, and others work for landowners for little or no money (for a
small share of the crop yield).<span>  </span>Work
is not guaranteed on a regular basis,

<p>Even though the parents earn very little, their primary
goal is their children's education, which is only way to better future - out of
extreme poverty. They are willing to make sacrifices, hoping that their
children will not have the same future as theirs. They are willing to eat less
and buy less, so that they can invest in their children's’ education -- and spend
the little money that they earn on books, uniforms and other materials required
for school.</p>
<p>Some of the children have to walk almost an hour to get to
school everyday. After school is finished, they go home and help their parents in
the fields, which makes that time they spent at school even more critical. The majority
of their parents are not educated beyond the third grade. Yet the parents know
and clearly understand that education is the only way to a better future. It offers
the only hope for a way out of extreme poverty.</p>
<p>The earthquake happened on a Saturday. Most of the students were
at home with their parents. When we asked them of their initial reaction, they
said that they were very scared. They did not know what to do. They ran outside
as quickly as possible. Then they camped outside for 2 to 3 weeks in fear of
aftershocks. Most of the houses in that area are damaged, some beyond repair.</p>

<p>We asked some of the students what they want to be when they
grow up. We were surprised, because no one said they want to be a farmer or
help their parents in their local shop. They were extremely optimistic and had
bigger life aspirations.   Some said they wanted to
be doctors so they can come back to the village and serve others, while others
said they wanted to be teachers, so they can teach and help improve the future
of their community.  We were glad to see that even in such a dire
situation, all the students were willing to leave the past behind and focus on
the future. These students inspired us.</p>

Almost four months
ago, the country of Nepal was devastated by multiple major earthquakes, taking
the lives of nearly 9,000 Nepalis and displacing hundreds of thousands more.The six Marines
and two Nepali soldiers aboard ""Vengeance 01"" gave their lives on 12
May 2015 during a UH-1Y helicopter crash while providing assistance to those
hit hardest as part of Operation Sahayogi Haat, or ""Helping Hand.""
It is in their spirit of giving and steadfast commitment that we
are proud to help rebuild the Bal Uddhar Secondary School in Nepal. And part of

Story of Nepal


Nepal is a developing country located in South Asia, located
between India and China. It is one of the poorest countries in the world, with the
majority of the population living below the poverty line. According to UNICEF,
""around 1.2 million Nepali children between the ages of five and 16 have
either never attended school or have dropped out. UNICEF's experience shows
that children who are out of school for extended periods, including during
emergencies, become less and less likely to ever return to the classroom.""

On April 25, 2015, a massive earthquake of 7.8 magnitude on the Richter
scale struck Nepal, followed by a second major tremor, on May 12. The death
toll from the two quakes now stands at nearly 9,000, and more than half a
million homes, most of them in hard to reach rural areas, are uninhabitable.
The full scale of destruction is still being assessed, as search and rescue
teams reach remote areas affected by these earthquakes.


Since the first two major
quakes, there have been more than a dozen quakes of magnitude 5 or higher, and
another two dozen between magnitude 4.5 and 5. U.S. Geological Survey predicts that
serious aftershocks could persist for at least a year. Many on the ground in
Nepal continue to report aftershocks, and many are still - living in tents and makeshift
shelters. 


Education


The current education system of Nepal is one of the youngest in
the world. Most of the children in rural areas are not exposed to
proper education. The public school infrastructure and curriculum in rural
Nepal is in very poor condition.  This
has been greatly affected, and magnified, by the recent earthquakes and
unstable situation.

The Project in Detail
According to a UNICEF report, at least 950,000 children in Nepal will not be able to return to school. “Almost one million children who were enrolled in school before the earthquake could now find they have no school building to return to,” said Tomoo Hozumi, UNICEF’s Representative in Nepal.  


Kavreplanchock (Kavre) District is one of the hard-hit areas by
the earthquake. Panauti-3 is a village in Kavre, and Bal Uddhar
Secondary School is the only public school in the village. It has been severely
damaged and deemed unsafe, unusable by the government of Nepal.



Before the earthquake there were 300-400 students attending Bal
Uddhar Secondary School. After the earthquake, the classes are being held either
in donated tents, patios of neighbors, or rooms rented from the neighbors.





Education For Purpose's goal is to rebuild Bal Uddhar Secondary School – a rural
public school, which in turn will provide proper education and needed support
to local youth.
School Reconstruction
Education For Purpose has received an official approval from the District Education
Department granting us permission to reconstruct the school according to
approved earthquake-resistant standards. Education For Purpose will have a team of volunteers and representation at the project site. Education For Purpose will leverage additional volunteers, and local residents as necessary. 


The Story of the Students and their Families

All of
the students are eager to learn. They are all from poor backgrounds, and mostly
from the lower, formerly untouchable caste. Most of their families work on
subsistence farms, and others work for landowners for little or no money (for a
small share of the crop yield).  Work
is not guaranteed on a regular basis,
and they earn about $2.50 for a 12-hour day -- barely enough to survive.  






Even though the parents earn very little, their primary
goal is their children's education, which is only way to better future - out of
extreme poverty. They are willing to make sacrifices, hoping that their
children will not have the same future as theirs. They are willing to eat less
and buy less, so that they can invest in their children's’ education -- and spend
the little money that they earn on books, uniforms and other materials required
for school.
Some of the children have to walk almost an hour to get to
school everyday. After school is finished, they go home and help their parents in
the fields, which makes that time they spent at school even more critical. The majority
of their parents are not educated beyond the third grade. Yet the parents know
and clearly understand that education is the only way to a better future. It offers
the only hope for a way out of extreme poverty.
The earthquake happened on a Saturday. Most of the students were
at home with their parents. When we asked them of their initial reaction, they
said that they were very scared. They did not know what to do. They ran outside
as quickly as possible. Then they camped outside for 2 to 3 weeks in fear of
aftershocks. Most of the houses in that area are damaged, some beyond repair.




We asked some of the students what they want to be when they
grow up. We were surprised, because no one said they want to be a farmer or
help their parents in their local shop. They were extremely optimistic and had
bigger life aspirations.   Some said they wanted to
be doctors so they can come back to the village and serve others, while others
said they wanted to be teachers, so they can teach and help improve the future
of their community.  We were glad to see that even in such a dire
situation, all the students were willing to leave the past behind and focus on
the future. These students inspired us.
This Is Where We Need You 
You have the chance to make a difference. You can give the children the most important gift of their lives, the gift of education. With your help, we have a chance to give these lost children hope, more importantly the hope of education. We will honor the Marines and soldiers by rebuilding the school. We want to make sure 
our
Marines legacy will live on, forever.

an Economic Engine for Paterson Through
the Arts

With the federal
designation of the Great Falls National Historical Park, Paterson, New Jersey is
poised to realize the dream of rejuvenating the historic district. Already
there are signs of life along Market Street at the entrance to the National
Park, and now we are seeking to raise seed money for a planning and feasibility
study to decide the best steps to take in remaking the area.

<p>In February of 2015, Rudy Gerson and Trevor Stankiewicz were asked by Professor and UN specialist <a href=""http://history.arts.cornell.edu/faculty-department-weiss.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">John Hubbel Weiss</a> to write an original play focused on the genocide in Darfur. Working closely with Weiss and Darfuri Scholar <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/17/opinion/in-sudan-the-janjaweed-rides-again.html?_r=0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ahmed Adam</a>, the pair created <i>The Darfur Compromised</i>, an informative, engaging, and bold new text. In April of 2015, the play premiered in Ithaca, NY in front of students, faculty, and local citizens. </p>
<p>Following this debut performance, Gerson and Stankiewicz were called into the office of Professor Bruce Levitt, who encouraged them to take the play to NYC and to form a professional production company to serve the play. From this meeting, Carsonic Productions was born. After receiving important dramaturgical notes, the play was retooled, strengthened, then performed September 2015 in Ithaca, NY.</p>
<p>In November of 2015, the play had its NYC debut to a full house at the historic Cherry Lane Theater. In 9 short months, the play grew from a school project to a professional work of art that raised thousands of dollars for Operation Broken Silence. </p>
<p>And that simply would not have been possible without the mentorship of our teachers, the support of our family, and the community of friends who energized us along the way.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary The number of students pursuing STEM education in tertiary institution in Tanzania has been dropping from 34% in 2004 to 14% in 2012. Due to this, Inspire STEM has decided to organize a STEM Boot Camp for Secondary School Students in Tanzania. 
This boot camp is aimed at increasing participation of students in the STEM field giving them an opportunity to learn about various career paths and develop interest in the field, triggering their creativity and research skills thus developing a well-rounded education essential to country’s development. 
This boot camp is important particularly to students who do not have access to knowledge about opportunities in STEM fields.    What We Need

This funds will cater for costs for secondary students from local communities across Tanzania who can not afford to cater for the camp expenses. 
The amount of funds received will determine how many secondary students will be selected to attend the camp. The more the funds, the more the students, the more the impact to the Tanzanian youth.  The total cost per head is 150$. The camp will take place for 5 days, and the funds will cater for accommodation, meals, transportation, STEM tool kits and excursion activities.     The Impact These funds will cater for 100 students across Tanzanian mainland particularly in rural areas who can not afford to attend the camp. 

We believe this will trigger students’ passion by actively engaging them into research, problem solving and creativity in the science and mathematics fields; 
Empower female students to actively participate and engage in STEM subjects, thus improving their overall performance in STEM fields; 
Offer career guidance and inspiration to students interested in pursuing higher education in the STEM fields; 
And serve as a bridge between the students, faculties and employers in the STEM fields.     Activities  The Boot Camp will have vast number of activities for students to explore and be part of the initiative. Such activities include, but not limited to:   Introduction to computer science and programming
Mobile App Development
Building robots and drones
Building renewal energy systems
Biomedical engineering at a glance
Science cafes and science slams
Excursion activities and team competitions
Career fair and 1:1 mentoring    Other Ways You Can Help  Please share the information with people who will be interested to share the spirit of STEM education to young Tanzanian youth
We accept STEM kits donations such as Raspberry Pi Kits, drone kits, etc",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<p>Greetings! I am immensely excited to finally share with you my <b>ALBUM</b> and special campaign project that changed my life.<br/></p>
<p>My name is Samuel J I am a musician from Cornwall south England. During a tour to Brazil I discovered some heavy truths with the many street children that I met.  <br/>Despite their courageous and larger than life smiles I found many of the children were being exploited in drug trafficking, arms trade and even sold for sex... </p>
<p> There courage was deeply moving and inspired my music. I wanted to help so I set out on a mission to create a large scale musical project with some of my musical heroes in Brazil. </p>
<p><b>THE ALBUM</b> <br/></p>
<p>It took me four years, and now the album is ready and features some of brazils top artists, they include <br/></p>

<p style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Hanel Yu - Kids' Food Basket (Grand Rapids, Michigan)<br/><br/></b></p>
<p>“Some people talked about football games. I talked about volunteer experiences.”</p>
<p>These are the candid words of Hanel Yu talking about service work among her high school peers. With an inspiration to help the hungry since her second year of high school, Hanel realized that volunteering was more than a resume-building experience. She soon learned that fighting hunger in her community meant so much more than anything she initially expected.</p>
<p>Hanel joined Kids Food Basket, a local non-profit organization that seeks to eliminate hunger in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Kids Food Basket packs hearty and nutritional meals for children who can’t afford lunch at poverty-stricken public schools. Hanel said she was most concerned about their developing brains. Kids Food Basket operates solely on volunteers, so Hanel was compelled to spread the word.</p>
<p>“It was there that I learned that hunger and poverty were all around me, not beyond me— which led me to vow to raise as much awareness and finances for these hungry children as possible,” she said.</p>
<p>Within the next school year, there were a lot more students from Hanel’s school that applied to be part of the organization. With Hanel’s help and voice, Kids Food Basket raised over $45,000 this year. On top of that accomplishment, Humanity Rising awarded her with a $500 service scholarship for being part of a greater future.</p>
<p>“I can’t eliminate world poverty, but it’s one step towards something better and making a better place for those who are impoverished,” she said.</p>

Johnny always had a knack for chess, but the relationships he built with the kids went far beyond a pair of doubled pawns.  Chess gave Johnny something positive he could bring to his community.  He believed that by teaching kids how to think critically while having fun and being competitive, they’d grow up making better decisions that would have a huge impact on the community.  Johnny said that chess gave him a reason to serve, and in return, he’s been rewarded in ways he never expected. “I just like to see how the kids react. I went into it expecting that the kids wouldn’t like it, being more into sports and videogames, but they got connected and started thinking a lot more.”</p><p>Humanity Rising is proud to award Johnny with a $500 Service Scholarship for his outstanding efforts working with youth and inspiring students and citizens alike to get involved in their local communities.

Our numbers are growing...and fast! Donate now and provide these motivated volunteers with scholarships for their outstanding efforts.Check out our updates page for all the service stories. Here's another from Grand Rapids, Michigan.



Hanel Yu - Kids' Food Basket (Grand Rapids, Michigan)
“Some people talked about football games. I talked about volunteer experiences.”
These are the candid words of Hanel Yu talking about service work among her high school peers. With an inspiration to help the hungry since her second year of high school, Hanel realized that volunteering was more than a resume-building experience. She soon learned that fighting hunger in her community meant so much more than anything she initially expected.
Hanel joined Kids Food Basket, a local non-profit organization that seeks to eliminate hunger in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Kids Food Basket packs hearty and nutritional meals for children who can’t afford lunch at poverty-stricken public schools. Hanel said she was most concerned about their developing brains. Kids Food Basket operates solely on volunteers, so Hanel was compelled to spread the word.
“It was there that I learned that hunger and poverty were all around me, not beyond me— which led me to vow to raise as much awareness and finances for these hungry children as possible,” she said.
Within the next school year, there were a lot more students from Hanel’s school that applied to be part of the organization. With Hanel’s help and voice, Kids Food Basket raised over $45,000 this year. On top of that accomplishment, Humanity Rising awarded her with a $500 service scholarship for being part of a greater future.
“I can’t eliminate world poverty, but it’s one step towards something better and making a better place for those who are impoverished,” she said.

<h3>Casataller</h3><p>Casataller is located in La Paz, Bolivia. It is a
space created in 2011 with the aim of promoting musical and sound creation
through educational, production, musical dissemination and research projects that benefit
artists, students, members of institutions, collaborators and audience
attending the activities. Currently a collective of Bolivian composers directs
Casataller and has concentrated its efforts on its most ambitious project: the
creation of a Composition School in Bolivia.</p>
<p>Casataller is a non-profit association which is held
through self-management and the cooperation of its partners.</p>
<h3><b>Composition School</b></h3>
<p>The Composition School project seeks to
contribute to the development of contemporary music through the formation of
composers with a solid technical and artistic foundation. This experience seeks
a multiplier effect and the existence of a real change in the Bolivian cultural
field. Music is a form of thought and Composing is a way of producing
knowledge, a place without new creators is bound to consume almost exclusively
music that has very little to do with its own reality.</p>
<h3><b>What do we need?</b></h3>
<p>Besides working with
tenured faculty, we have organized work with seven guest lecturers from
different backgrounds and different aesthetic trends.</p>
<p>We need $ 15,000 to
cover airfare, accomodation and fees for all our guests.</p>

<p>Alessandro Perini (Italy, 1983)</p>
<p>The permanent professors
in the School of Composition are Canela Palacios, Sebastian Zuleta, Lluvia
Bustos and Miguel Llanque, who are also the project promoters. However, we
believe that access to a wide range of approaches and experiences is essential
to achieve an optimal level of education.</p>
<p>That is why these seven
invited professors will offer master classes and workshops to our students. If
we reach the goal of this fundraising campaign we will have achieved an
unprecedented event in the history of bolivian music education.</p>

<p>This campaign is about Citizens for Affordable Housing, Inc. (<i>a HUD certified housing counseling agency</i>) raising money for apprenticeships in the housing industry for at-risk kids and providing scholarships to institution of higher learning. </p>
<p>Citizens for Affordable Housing, Inc has always been a privately owned company and we want to keep from jumping through extensive hoops of going to major investors to fund this campaign. We want to give the world and more specifically the community an opportunity to join us in launching this next phase of home ownership education from hands-on perspective. </p>

<p>This new program from Citizens for
Affordable Housing, Inc.  will bring a new perspective to homeownership
education . This program will train students, who would
not have been able to attend institutions of higher learning, to have the skills to
know the housing industry and will seek to get college credits or certifications while
doing it. While focusing on this education, the organization will be
strengthening the pool of integrity driven Loan Officers, Realtors, Contractors
and many other professionals in the housing industry. </p>

<strong>

 This initiative will be successful</strong> because there
have been so many people who wanted to be the best version of themselves and
they didn’t have a pathway to do it until now. We believe in staying in our
lane, which is the housing industry. We will seek to find those who seek a
career in Mortgage Financing, Housing Counseling, Real Estate, etc. and
eliminate the excuse for why they can’t be a success in that area and give them
the tools to succeed. </div><div>
<strong>Another reason why</strong> this will be a success
is because we have effective and prosperous housing professionals that will be
serving on the board as well as volunteers to make sure that real life
applications are being introduced and experienced by those that come through
the program. </div><div>
<strong>Lastly and the ultimate reason why</strong>, is
because of You. Your donations and your support means the world to this
organization and to those that will come through this program for years to
come. We will ever keep your names and your contributions to this vision before
those long after this program is thriving and touching so many lives. We as an
organization believe in being great stewards of funds brought in whether
through donations, grants, programs support or sustainable methods.  Many of you have been recipients of our
services or partnerships and you know that we provide the most honest and
integrity driven service we can render. The
statistics in the Nashville and surrounding areas of Tennessee is that 1 in
every 60 people have either gone through the program or their family member
has. That is longevity and impact. </div>

</ul><p><em><em><strong>Don’t just watch the revolution, but be apart of it. Changing the Housing Industry while changing Lives!</strong></em></em></p><ul>
</ul><div> </div> <p><br/></p></div>","The Focus: 
This campaign is about Citizens for Affordable Housing, Inc. (a HUD certified housing counseling agency) raising money for apprenticeships in the housing industry for at-risk kids and providing scholarships to institution of higher learning. 
Citizens for Affordable Housing, Inc has always been a privately owned company and we want to keep from jumping through extensive hoops of going to major investors to fund this campaign. We want to give the world and more specifically the community an opportunity to join us in launching this next phase of home ownership education from hands-on perspective. 
Only 18% of young at-risk adults never get connected to school or work from the ages of 18-24. WE HAVE TO CHANGE THIS!



Our Vision

The New Program: 


This new program from Citizens for
Affordable Housing, Inc.  will bring a new perspective to homeownership
education . This program will train students, who would
not have been able to attend institutions of higher learning, to have the skills to
know the housing industry and will seek to get college credits or certifications while
doing it. While focusing on this education, the organization will be
strengthening the pool of integrity driven Loan Officers, Realtors, Contractors
and many other professionals in the housing industry. 



The
ultimate vision is to build a housing industry university that educates those
who believe they are interested in it and propels them forward to pursue higher learning. 



The program will Expose the recipients of the program to all components of the housing industry. 

Real properties will be used to be a training ground for learning the industry trades.
Efforts from this program will create opportunities for Affordable Housing for low-to-moderate income homebuyers to have a piece of the ""American Dream""

We seek to provide
scholarships for those  wanting to attend 4 year/2 year colleges or
trade schools for certifications. We want to be an intricate part to properly educating
and setting individuals up for success in a career that means so much to so
many. 
Why:
The Founder and CEO of a Nashville Housing Counseling Agency only wanted to help homeowners have a smooth and educated experience for homeownership over 28 years ago. Her dream has been fulfilled in many ways, but has been threatened with the change of times and wildly volatile housing markets. The recent threats have almost bankrupt the  organization. Our fundraising mission is to Save the Organization by expanding the company's scope to help more individuals in the process.

Citizens For Affordable Housing, Inc.  has been ahead of the curve  in Housing Counseling maneuvers for 28 years, and in 2015 seeks to transform how the entire Housing Industry is experienced and how people are educated for placement is in the “Housing Servicing Team”.    What We Need & What You Get 

This is how the Fund Raised will be allocated: 


Primarily, the funds will be used to insure that the right candidates are awarded the assistance needed to go to the institution that will provide them the degree, certification, or license they need.Next the funds will be used to assemble a team to implement the proposed system for reaching out to those that will benefit most from the program.  Lastly the final third of the funds will be used to continue the program related activities already in place.  
 Because of you being a part of this ground breaking initiative , we have some amazing Perks that you will want to give attention to! View the Perks Section.
We have an amazing relationship with one of the Hotels in the Music City USA and have a Weekend Stay as one of the perks when you join us in this cause.
    The Impact and Why it will Be Successful! 


 This initiative will be successful because there
have been so many people who wanted to be the best version of themselves and
they didn’t have a pathway to do it until now. We believe in staying in our
lane, which is the housing industry. We will seek to find those who seek a
career in Mortgage Financing, Housing Counseling, Real Estate, etc. and
eliminate the excuse for why they can’t be a success in that area and give them
the tools to succeed. 
Another reason why this will be a success
is because we have effective and prosperous housing professionals that will be
serving on the board as well as volunteers to make sure that real life
applications are being introduced and experienced by those that come through
the program. 
Lastly and the ultimate reason why, is
because of You. Your donations and your support means the world to this
organization and to those that will come through this program for years to
come. We will ever keep your names and your contributions to this vision before
those long after this program is thriving and touching so many lives. We as an
organization believe in being great stewards of funds brought in whether
through donations, grants, programs support or sustainable methods.  Many of you have been recipients of our
services or partnerships and you know that we provide the most honest and
integrity driven service we can render. The
statistics in the Nashville and surrounding areas of Tennessee is that 1 in
every 60 people have either gone through the program or their family member
has. That is longevity and impact. 
    Risks & Our Plan To Succeed...  
With the newest move to salvage and
expand the company, new life has been instilled. With a wealth of Knowledge
joining us from various areas of the industry, the company is looking for a
moving to a more sustainable plan to continue to be a help to as many as the
organization can handle without the life support of granted funds and

Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  Share this funding mission throughout your social networks.  
Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about your campaign.

</p><p><b>Als Ob</b> is a high school journalism project which supports every child’s
right to culture and arts. <b>The project began in November 2011,</b> when the first
<b>Als Ob </b>Edition was published, after a huge effort and a great deal of work and
dedication from the Nicolae Iorga High-school students in Negresti, Vaslui
County (Romania). </p>
<p>During these four years, the magazine was awarded twice in the national
cultural magazines competition. Unfortunately, although the students are
working on the 16<sup>th</sup> edition, the future of the project looks bleak,
as funding is harder and harder to obtain.</p>
<p>The initiator of this project is Florin Onica, philosophy teacher, poet
and artist, who dedicated his full energy, time and money to help students and
the community become sensitive to high level culture and art.</p>
<p>He has published three poetry books and is the main song writer in the
Romanian band Nu Acum, winner of over 20 prizes in music festivals throughout
Romania, between 1999 and 2012.</p>
<p>Florin is also a leader in the school and in the community, being the
initiator of several cultural meetings and music concerts.</p>
<p>The <b>Als Ob</b> project holds the highest priority in Florin’s life, which is

</div>","Als Ob is a high school journalism project which supports every child’s
right to culture and arts. The project began in November 2011, when the first
Als Ob Edition was published, after a huge effort and a great deal of work and
dedication from the Nicolae Iorga High-school students in Negresti, Vaslui
County (Romania). 
During these four years, the magazine was awarded twice in the national
cultural magazines competition. Unfortunately, although the students are
working on the 16th edition, the future of the project looks bleak,
as funding is harder and harder to obtain.
The initiator of this project is Florin Onica, philosophy teacher, poet
and artist, who dedicated his full energy, time and money to help students and
the community become sensitive to high level culture and art.
He has published three poetry books and is the main song writer in the
Romanian band Nu Acum, winner of over 20 prizes in music festivals throughout
Romania, between 1999 and 2012.
Florin is also a leader in the school and in the community, being the
initiator of several cultural meetings and music concerts.
The Als Ob project holds the highest priority in Florin’s life, which is
proven by the fact that, during the four years of existence, he invested over
$3000 from his teacher salary, which, in Romania, is $300 per month.
Keeping this magazine alive is a very high stake: it has a huge cultural
influence on the small town of Negresti, as well as on the students’
psychological and cultural development.
If Als Ob finds resources to continue, the outcomes are extraordinary:


As mentioned above, the cultural influence on the small town of
Negresti, as well as many generations of students will benefit from
psychological and cultural development;

Als Ob provides a cultural link between Negresti and other cities in the
country, as well as a bridge between the local high-school and other
high-schools in the main cultural cities in Romania;

Als Ob has already been a starting point for young artists (poets,
photographers, painters), who will be students in the most prestigious
Universities in Romania and Europe;

So far, the magazine collaborated with many American Peace Corps
Volunteers, who advertised the project in their own American communities;

Over 1500 students read each edition of the magazine;

Between 2011-2015, over 60 students worked as editors for this magazine.


 Als Ob has four editions per
year (one for each season) and it costs $ 6000 to print 150 magazines, which
are 170 pages each. If the project receives more money than it needs for
printing each edition, the funds will go towards improving and expanding the
tools needed for every magazine: voice recorders, cameras, computer, software, magazine
collections, etc.
Your involvement in this project can make a huge difference, as: 


Als Ob is literally the only doorway for the students in Negresti to
freely express their creativity and to develop their cultural foundations;

You can help revive the printed cultural magazines, which are losing a
lot of ground in favor of the electronic ones;

Als Ob covers a wide range of arts: literature, social sciences,
painting, photography, drama,  film.


Als Ob was faced with many challenges during its existence, but the team
managed to maturely overcome any difficulty, becoming ever stronger and
experienced. Some of the challenges were:


The lack of interest for cultural activities  of the local community (which started to
change, by constantly raising awareness and involving people in these

<p>Merhaba,benim adım İdil Tekelioğlu,19 yaşındayım ve geçen sene
Avni Akyol Güzel Sanatlar Lisesi'nin müzik bölümünden mezun oldum. Oyunculuk,
benim çok küçük yaşta sahneye ilk ""Pinokyo"" olarak çıktığımda
keşfettiğim bir tutkuydu. Ben büyüdüm,oyunculuğa olan aşkım büyüdü,hayallerim
büyüdü. Gözlerimi kapattığımda gelecekte kendimi gördüğüm tek bir yer,kendimi
düşündüğüm tek bir an vardı; Amerika'da çok iyi bir oyuncu olduktan sonra
ülkemi elimde altın bir heykelciği tutarak temsil edebilmek... 13 yaşında
Amerika'da oyunculuk eğitimi alabilmek için bir üniversiteye gitmek istediğime
karar verdim ve engebeli bir yola adım attım. Gerek ben,gerek ailem maddi
manevi bir seferberliğin içine girdik. Yemedim,içmedim,uyumadım ve sadece tek
bir şey için çalıştım; hayallerim.</p>
<p>Uzun bir zaman sonra hem TOEFL hem SAT sınavına girdim, ve
istediğim puanları alınca seçmelerim için oyunculuk derslerine başladım. Bir
yıl boyunca grup derslerine katıldığım oyuncu koçu Merve Taşkan, bana
monologlarımı hazırlamakta yardım etti. Gel gelelim sınavlarım için New York'a
gittim, ve şu an,  neredeyse seçmelerine girdiğim her okuldan, 6 yerden
kabulüm var..  Peki ya şimdi?</p>
<p>Gitmek istediğim okul Amerika'nın en iyi drama
konservatuarlarından biri;American Academy of Dramatic Arts. Zaferime,
hayallerimi gerçekleştirmeye bir adım daha yaklaştım,fakat şimdi en büyük
engelim var karşımda, yıkmam gereken son duvarım,son dönemecim; burs bulmak...</p>
<p>Ne yazık ki bütçemiz okulumun masraflarını karşılamaya yetmiyor
ve başvurduğum yerlerden henüz bir ses çıkmadı. Bu sebeple ben de kendi
kampanyamı başlatıp sesimi,hikayemi duyurmaya karar verdim!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Siz de  bana katkıda bulunarak hayallerime bir adım daha
yaklaşmama yardım edebilirsiniz. Ben bir ilk olmak,farklı olmak,imkansiz
denileni başarabilmek,gelecekte ülkemi en iyi şekilde temsil edebilmek ve
herkesin hayallerine ulaşabileceğini kanıtlamak istiyorum,belki Broadway
sahnelerinde, belki de elimde altın bir heykelcikle... Çünkü hayaller gerçek

<p><b>Support a Turkish actress candidate for her education!</b></p>
<p>Hello, my name is Idil Tekelioglu, I’m
19 years old and graduated from Avni Akyol Fine Arts High School’s music
department last year. Acting was a passion that I found out with my very first
step to the stage as ""Pinochio"" at the age of six. I grew up as my passion and love for
acting and my dreams got bigger and bigger. When I closed my eyes, I saw one
magical moment, one remarkable scene in my head; becoming the “First Turkish
actress” who wins an Academy Award… When I was thirteen years old, I decided to
get into a drama school in America and took a step towards my intractable path.
My parents and I fought really hard both personally and financially. I didn’t
eat, didn’t sleep, didn’t go out, but studied only for one thing; my dreams.</p>
<p>After two years of struggle to improve
my low English skills, I took really high scores from TOEFL and SAT and started
to take acting lessons from an acting coach, Merve Taskan. We prepared three
monologues in a month and I went to my dream city, New York for my auditions. I
have 6 acceptances, from almost every school which I’ve auditioned for. And

Merhaba,benim adım İdil Tekelioğlu,19 yaşındayım ve geçen sene
Avni Akyol Güzel Sanatlar Lisesi'nin müzik bölümünden mezun oldum. Oyunculuk,
benim çok küçük yaşta sahneye ilk ""Pinokyo"" olarak çıktığımda
keşfettiğim bir tutkuydu. Ben büyüdüm,oyunculuğa olan aşkım büyüdü,hayallerim
büyüdü. Gözlerimi kapattığımda gelecekte kendimi gördüğüm tek bir yer,kendimi
düşündüğüm tek bir an vardı; Amerika'da çok iyi bir oyuncu olduktan sonra
ülkemi elimde altın bir heykelciği tutarak temsil edebilmek... 13 yaşında
Amerika'da oyunculuk eğitimi alabilmek için bir üniversiteye gitmek istediğime
karar verdim ve engebeli bir yola adım attım. Gerek ben,gerek ailem maddi
manevi bir seferberliğin içine girdik. Yemedim,içmedim,uyumadım ve sadece tek
bir şey için çalıştım; hayallerim.
Uzun bir zaman sonra hem TOEFL hem SAT sınavına girdim, ve
istediğim puanları alınca seçmelerim için oyunculuk derslerine başladım. Bir
yıl boyunca grup derslerine katıldığım oyuncu koçu Merve Taşkan, bana
monologlarımı hazırlamakta yardım etti. Gel gelelim sınavlarım için New York'a
gittim, ve şu an,  neredeyse seçmelerine girdiğim her okuldan, 6 yerden
kabulüm var..  Peki ya şimdi?
Gitmek istediğim okul Amerika'nın en iyi drama
konservatuarlarından biri;American Academy of Dramatic Arts. Zaferime,
hayallerimi gerçekleştirmeye bir adım daha yaklaştım,fakat şimdi en büyük
engelim var karşımda, yıkmam gereken son duvarım,son dönemecim; burs bulmak...
Ne yazık ki bütçemiz okulumun masraflarını karşılamaya yetmiyor
ve başvurduğum yerlerden henüz bir ses çıkmadı. Bu sebeple ben de kendi
kampanyamı başlatıp sesimi,hikayemi duyurmaya karar verdim!

Siz de  bana katkıda bulunarak hayallerime bir adım daha
yaklaşmama yardım edebilirsiniz. Ben bir ilk olmak,farklı olmak,imkansiz
denileni başarabilmek,gelecekte ülkemi en iyi şekilde temsil edebilmek ve
herkesin hayallerine ulaşabileceğini kanıtlamak istiyorum,belki Broadway
sahnelerinde, belki de elimde altın bir heykelcikle... Çünkü hayaller gerçek
olmak için vardır!*******

Support a Turkish actress candidate for her education!
Hello, my name is Idil Tekelioglu, I’m
19 years old and graduated from Avni Akyol Fine Arts High School’s music
department last year. Acting was a passion that I found out with my very first
step to the stage as ""Pinochio"" at the age of six. I grew up as my passion and love for
acting and my dreams got bigger and bigger. When I closed my eyes, I saw one
magical moment, one remarkable scene in my head; becoming the “First Turkish
actress” who wins an Academy Award… When I was thirteen years old, I decided to
get into a drama school in America and took a step towards my intractable path.
My parents and I fought really hard both personally and financially. I didn’t
eat, didn’t sleep, didn’t go out, but studied only for one thing; my dreams.
After two years of struggle to improve
my low English skills, I took really high scores from TOEFL and SAT and started
to take acting lessons from an acting coach, Merve Taskan. We prepared three
monologues in a month and I went to my dream city, New York for my auditions. I
have 6 acceptances, from almost every school which I’ve auditioned for. And
now?
The school I want to go is one of the
most prestigious conservatories in America, American Academy of Dramatic Arts.
I’m so close to embrace my dreams and my victory, but I have my last, and probably
the biggest obstacle on my path; finding a scholarship.
Unfortunately, we don’t have the budget
to pursue my education in New York. In order to make my dreams come true, I
need to find a scholarship or a sponsor. I haven’t got any positive response
from the institutions I’ve applied yet, so I decided to start my own campaign
to make my voice and story heard!
You can help me to pursue my education
and eventually become the First Turkish Academy Award-winning actress by donating my
cause. I want to be the first, I want to be different. I want to make my
“so-called” impossible dreams come true, prove that there is no such a thing as
impossible, and represent my country by playing on Broadway or holding a
beautiful, golden statue in my hands… Because dreams are made to come true!",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

We will set intentions for peace, chant peace prayers and mantras from different traditions so we can all connect to each others' basic humanity, sincerity and recognize that, Peace is our yearning no matter who we are!Free For All!May 21st, 4pm-8pmQuaker Meeting House701 W. Howard Ave Decatur , GA 30030STORYOn September 11, 2001, my world came crashing down. Like many Americans, I felt completely violated. I feared for the safety of my children and my family. I remember thinking, ""This only happens in far away countries, to people who often don't even feel real. How could it ever happen to us, in USA?"" I know a lot of you felt this ways. As time went by I kept praying and asking for directions. I knew some how my life's journey included being a voice for peace. What I learned was even more profound. I realized that even though each one of us, in this world, has different paths, our ultimate goal is happiness and peace within ourselves and around us. When I looked in my own heart, I found it to be full of pain, suffering and anxiety. I yearned so much for peace but, it was hard to feel it. So it became my mission to find the source of peace in my heart. From here I began coaching others how to get in touch with their inner happiness and peace. All through this time, I knew I was going to organize peace events and bring people together for peace. In fact, back in 2005 and 2006, I even got a team together to begin working on this goal. But as life would have it, those plans did not materialize.In 2014, while listening to a CD set on Sanskrit mantras, I came across the story of Vesak which commemorates Buddha's birth, enlightenment and death anniversary. According to this story, every year on full moon in May, Christ, Buddha and everyone who has worked on the upliftment of the world gather on an esoteric plane. There is a crystal bowl with a liquid in front of Christ who says a mantra. At the moment of the full moon, Buddha emanates a beautiful light and at this moment, everyone on the earth gets a quickening.  Everyone present then gets a drink of the water charged with the mantras and leaves. Global Peace event is a modified recreation of the above event. If we are to create lasting peace we will have to learn to look at each other's humanity. If peace has to become reality, we will have to learn to respect each other, come together, pray together, break bread together, share ideas, share joys, share tears, and uplift each other. Global Peace Event is a step in the direction of coming together for peace. It is a call to recognize our own and each other's  humanity. It is a call to come together, for all who care about peace. The EventThis is a high impact, high vibration event grounded in the knowledge that all action start at the level of thought and intentionsThis event is a commemoration of Buddha's birth, enlightenment and death. Vesak is celebrated by people all over the world. In this celebration we are inviting people from different walks of life, spiritual backgrounds and thought form. Our purpose is to have conversations about peace and how to make peace a priority in our own lives.This is a unique opportunity for you to listen to an exciting panel of speakers from different spiritual backgrounds as well as peace professionals and peace activists. These speakers will talk about peace in their paradigm and how to make peace a priority in your life. They will also help set intentions for peace and will bring peace prayers and mantras from their own spiritual background for us to repeat and chant.You will receive water charged and infused with these peace intentions and prayers. Speakers Dr. Sherrill HayesPeace ProfessionalDr. Sherrill Hayes Ph.D., Newcastle University; M.S. & B.S.

<h1><b>Short Summary</b></h1>
<h3><b>Hadrian Series: Our
Vision…</b></h3>
<p>Our vision is to create spaces for families and
communities to learn, explore and play together. Our desire is to contribute in
the cultivation of a mindful life, one that allows human beings to nurture
focus and attention, and make choices with an open mind, open heart and open
will. </p>
<p>Hadrian Series has come to being as a way to
respond to this intention, by offering parents, coaches and educators a new
narrative to support children in their growth developmentally. This is a
two-way path. While the intention is to support the child, through the conversation
(from Latin: con-versare- means to turn to one another), we create our dance
of language that brings both the adult and the child together into a discovery,
a new narrative that they co-create in partnership. </p>
<p>Hadrian Series starts its journey with Baby Light,
a book that celebrates light and life, through a curious and sparkling inquiry.
Baby Light will be soon followed by a few other books, which have already emerged
and are in the creative process.  </p>
<p>We intend to create a bouquet of resources,
especially in the space of children literature and playful learning, and we
would like to facilitate and host a space for others who feel compelled to
contribute and work with us to fulfill this vision. </p>
<p>Hadrian Series is a calling to all of us as “human
becomings” to bring forth the goodness and the beauty of the world at any given
moment. If you feel compelled to co-create with us and/or to support this
emergence forward, we welcome a conversation. </p>
<h3><b><i>WHY THIS BOOK? -A personal story of growth </i></b></h3>
<p>When my son Hadrian came to the world I experienced
a major shift, one of those overnight root expansions, like at the“Jack and the
Magic Beans”...My heart grew bigger and my capacity to be with others expanded.
How do you manage all that? I stayed with it and with all the support from
family and friends I was able to navigate the newness and actually tap into the
evergreen source that it was bringing forth for me. One day at a time, I was
able to accept that life had slowed down and that I was living in a different
rhythm; one that required another kind of care and lots of patience. I remember
how I started noticing in my neighborhood the gorgeous trees, the birds that
visited and all the kind people all around us. Walking with Hadrian allowed me
to see all that. I could whiteness the beauty and the goodness right in front
of me. It was all there to be celebrated. 
</p>
<p>One day, when my son Hadrian was about 1(one) and
he had just started to walk, I was sitting in the living room reading, when I
witnessed something extraordinary. I saw what I could have easily seen before,
only that now I was “SEEING” with a new pair of eyes. I was seeing, sensing and
embodying it. The sunlight had fallen inside the room and the string of light
was creating quite an excitement for Hadrian, who seemed curious and playfully
exploring. I saw him poking and turning around, and then going back and forth
as the light appeared and disappeared in his presence. Oh, it was magical!
Inside me, it felt like a stiff “Grinch” was melting down and all of a sudden I
was like a child. I wanted to play and delve in wonder!  It was this story that inspired the creation
of<b> Baby Light, a children’s book for the
family, </b><b>one that
inspires an open mind, an open heart and an open will. </b>It's a way
to go deeper with how beauty affects us right NOW, <b>supporting children’s growth through
the art of beauty and mindfulness.</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464449911/ac7246b8-7e47-4346-96fa-9569764dd7c7_1_vjozlp.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>As the experience was landing, I felt the desire to
support Hadrian in exploring what had happened at a deeper level, in simple
ways. When we grow we somehow lose that sense of play and wonder, it almost
feels like we cut fun once we get into the real work. I felt the need to offer
my son another way of looking at life and the daily experience where we
whiteness, observe, engage and breathe. I became so compelled at creating a new
narrative to support his growth, one that allows him to explore and find beauty
in everything. He can search for his own answers and yet have the guidance that
offers him possibilities. I wanted to invite him into a new language through
embodiment and inquiry, one that can open up choices from a place of care and
alignment.  </p>
<p>I am
compelled to see this little story be a dialogue builder, a new way of creating
a space for children and parents, for families, to celebrate splendor and
goodness everyday. It is an invitation for parents, coaches and educators <b>and
anyone who has the desire and passion to create spaces for families to come
together, to learn and explore. </b>It
is my desire to support human
beings develop emotional, cognitive, relational, somatic and spiritual competence,
to serve as a foundation for growth and development and to live life to its
fullest.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464450431/IMG_7079_prc4s0.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 620px;height: 605px;""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464450456/IMG_7081_atdp6h.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1464450485/IMG_7080_mxa8jp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>

two-way path. While the intention is to support the child, through the conversation
(from Latin: con-versare- means to turn to one another), we create our dance
of language that brings both the adult and the child together into a discovery,
a new narrative that they co-create in partnership. 
Hadrian Series starts its journey with Baby Light,
a book that celebrates light and life, through a curious and sparkling inquiry.
Baby Light will be soon followed by a few other books, which have already emerged
and are in the creative process.  
We intend to create a bouquet of resources,
especially in the space of children literature and playful learning, and we
would like to facilitate and host a space for others who feel compelled to
contribute and work with us to fulfill this vision. 
Hadrian Series is a calling to all of us as “human
becomings” to bring forth the goodness and the beauty of the world at any given
moment. If you feel compelled to co-create with us and/or to support this
emergence forward, we welcome a conversation. 
WHY THIS BOOK? -A personal story of growth 
When my son Hadrian came to the world I experienced
a major shift, one of those overnight root expansions, like at the“Jack and the
Magic Beans”...My heart grew bigger and my capacity to be with others expanded.
How do you manage all that? I stayed with it and with all the support from
family and friends I was able to navigate the newness and actually tap into the
evergreen source that it was bringing forth for me. One day at a time, I was
able to accept that life had slowed down and that I was living in a different
rhythm; one that required another kind of care and lots of patience. I remember
how I started noticing in my neighborhood the gorgeous trees, the birds that
visited and all the kind people all around us. Walking with Hadrian allowed me
to see all that. I could whiteness the beauty and the goodness right in front
of me. It was all there to be celebrated. 

One day, when my son Hadrian was about 1(one) and
he had just started to walk, I was sitting in the living room reading, when I
witnessed something extraordinary. I saw what I could have easily seen before,
only that now I was “SEEING” with a new pair of eyes. I was seeing, sensing and
embodying it. The sunlight had fallen inside the room and the string of light
was creating quite an excitement for Hadrian, who seemed curious and playfully
exploring. I saw him poking and turning around, and then going back and forth
as the light appeared and disappeared in his presence. Oh, it was magical!
Inside me, it felt like a stiff “Grinch” was melting down and all of a sudden I
was like a child. I wanted to play and delve in wonder!  It was this story that inspired the creation
of Baby Light, a children’s book for the
family, one that
inspires an open mind, an open heart and an open will. It's a way
to go deeper with how beauty affects us right NOW, supporting children’s growth through
the art of beauty and mindfulness.

As the experience was landing, I felt the desire to
support Hadrian in exploring what had happened at a deeper level, in simple
ways. When we grow we somehow lose that sense of play and wonder, it almost
feels like we cut fun once we get into the real work. I felt the need to offer
my son another way of looking at life and the daily experience where we
whiteness, observe, engage and breathe. I became so compelled at creating a new
narrative to support his growth, one that allows him to explore and find beauty
in everything. He can search for his own answers and yet have the guidance that
offers him possibilities. I wanted to invite him into a new language through
embodiment and inquiry, one that can open up choices from a place of care and
alignment.  
I am
compelled to see this little story be a dialogue builder, a new way of creating
a space for children and parents, for families, to celebrate splendor and
goodness everyday. It is an invitation for parents, coaches and educators and
anyone who has the desire and passion to create spaces for families to come
together, to learn and explore. It
is my desire to support human
beings develop emotional, cognitive, relational, somatic and spiritual competence,
to serve as a foundation for growth and development and to live life to its
fullest.


Our Goal Our Goal is to have this
book published and go live on July 30th,
2016. We would like to first get it published as a paperback and next as an
e-book and share this story with as many parents, children, coaches and
educators to support meaningful conversations. 
With the help and care of my talented husband
Gianfranco, who has done incredible work to create the illustrations, and so
many other family members and friends this book is almost done and ready for self-publishing.
With your engagement and contribution we can make it happen!
The investment 
All funds received up to and including the goal
amount of $12,000 will be used on Baby Light printing costs for the first 1000
books and as a start-up costs for the 2 other books that we have on the works.
As a startup project the set up and printing costs are by far the biggest
expense for Hadrian Series (including design, production, set up, etc). The book
will be sold online primarily via Amazon and through select bookstores. 
How
may you join? 
We would love to have you become a part
of our journey. Your contribution will be an important foundation to bring the
first step to completion. There are different ways you may choose to join in
and of course we are always open to new ideas. 
We are an amazing team and we will put
to the service of this venture our talents and skills to make it happen( you
will see some of these in the list of choices/perks)
The
book would be in your hands by the 30th of July 2016. 
What we see as possibilities? What
would it look like?
Once
the book is released on July 2016, we plan some of the following activities: 


Conversations
in Pre-Schools and Pre-Ks in the Washington Metropolitan Area and Tirana,
Albania and or, anywhere we can find friends and colleagues who may arrange a
visit


Small café
conversations with parents, coaches and educators


Talks and
presentations at coaching and educators’ conferences


Workshops,
for parents, coaches and educators, that:




Help to facilitate the reflection on the question” How to I bring my
beauty and goodness forth, NOW?


Focus on creating mindful choices to design the life that you want


Create new narratives for conversations in the family, workplace and life


Help build clarity and focus through creative inquiry and discovery

Support transitions in life and allow you to navigate newness

 5. Sharing the work with anyone who shows up and is curious to explore and co-  create (like YOU, your ideas and thoughts are welcome)

<p>The total B-52B restoration cost is expected to be $120,000. Approximately 1/2 of this cost will be paid by this Indiegogo project. The money raised in this campaign will be used for the cosmetic restoration of the fuselage and wings. That is, to purchase the paint ($460) per gallon and primer ($300 per gallon), prepare the airplane's surface and then paint the fuselage and wings. This will also include painting the ""Air Force Special Weapons Center"" insignia on the starboard side and the ""Air Force Systems Command"" on the port side. To learn more about the B-52B surface area calculations and the cost of the paint for this project, please <a href=""http://www.nuclearmuseum.org/assets/uploads/general/B-52B%20Paint%20Information.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">click here</a>. </p>
<p></p>
<p>If we exceed our campaign goal, we will work to add wheel-chair accessible pathways around the aircraft as well as lighting that will truly bring the airplane to life. In the instance we do not reach our entire goal of $60,000 with this campaign, Museum staff and volunteers will continue to push forward on the restoration. Painting an airplane of this size requires multiple work phases - including preparing the aircraft for paint, application of primer and application of paint - and we would focus on the phases that required less labor costs until sufficient funds are raised.</p>
<p>With a quickly approaching target completion date for the B-52B restoration of August, 2016, we ask that you please consider becoming a member of the National Museum of Nuclear Science &amp; History's B-52B Restoration Team by making a donation through Indiegogo! As a part of the B-52B support team, you will personally help in the preservation of this iconic aircraft.</p>

<div><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">The B-52 Stratofortress is a
long-range, subsonic, jet-powered strategic bomber. Built by Boeing – with a
wingspan of 185 ft and weighing 420,000 lbs – B-52 airplanes
have been operated by the United States Air Force since the 1950s and the more
recent models are expected to serve continuously into the future. </span></div>

<div>
<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The first
B-52B  - one of only 50 ever made - was delivered to the Strategic Air Command (SAC) in June of 1955, and the B-model was the first in the B-52 series to actually serve with operational bomb wings in the Strategic Air Command. Over the
years, the aircraft has proved itself in combat and peace time readiness. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;"">The B-52B – the type of aircraft located at the National Museum of Nuclear Science &amp; History – was the first truly operational version of the Stratofortress that
featured an enhanced reconnaissance capability and was fitted with a
bombing/navigation system, and they remained in service into the mid-1960s when
they were traded in for more modern B-52s. </span><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;""> </span><br/>

<p>“Our B-52 at the National Museum of Nuclear Science &amp; History is truly Albuquerque’s airplane,” said Jim Walther, Museum Director. “This airplane was delivered directly from Boeing to Kirtland in 1955, assigned to the Special Weapons Center at Kirtland Air Force Base, and it was never assigned to another Air Force base.”</p>

<p>
</p>
<p>On April 29, 1955, Kirtland Air
Force Base (KAFB) received its first B-52B Stratofortress (our B-52B), s/n 52-0013. Major Jerome L. Blanchard accepted delivery of the aircraft at the
Boeing Plant in Seattle and piloted the aircraft to KAFB. All crew members were
from the 4925<sup>th</sup> Test Group. </p>
<p>The aircraft was among the first
ten B-52Bs delivered to the Air Force. “Old 013” was assigned
to the Air Force Special Weapons Center at Kirtland Air Force Base. Our B-52B conducted many drop tests of inert
weapon shapes to explore weapons separation characteristics at release and to
gather ballistics data.</p>
<p>The aircraft participated in the <i>Redwing Cherokee</i> test, near the Bikini
Atoll.  On May 21, 1956, it became the
first B-52 to drop a live nuclear device and the first aircraft to drop a hydrogen bomb. Our B-52B  also participated in <i>Operation Dominic</i> which took place from April until
November 1962. <i>Operation Dominic</i> saw
the last atmospheric tests, including air drops of nuclear devices. In its
years of service, B-52B, s/n 52-0013, dropped over one dozen live nuclear devices in various
operations.</p>
<p>When the Limited Nuclear Test Ban treaty was signed in 1963, Albuquerque’s B-52B, s/n 52-0013, was removed from the roster and was later delivered to the Museum, formerly known as the National Atomic Museum, in 1971.</p>

<div>
<p>Restoration of the B-29 began in April of 2015 under the supervision of Restoration Project Coordinator, Major Jerry Hanks, USMC (Retired), with help from Museum staff and volunteers and was funded by donations received from supporters and entities with personal ties to the Museum and the historic aircraft.

<p>The National Museum of Nuclear Science &amp; History staff, board of trustees and volunteers all passionately believe in the mission of our Museum, and we know its past and future success depends on the generosity of our donors, volunteers and supporters.  Our heartfelt thanks go out to all of you.</p>
<p><i>Operation Preservation, The Campaign to Restore the Planes in Heritage Park</i> is a massive undertaking, with the B-52B Stratofortress being only one of the five aircraft needing to be restored.  It would be impossible for the Museum to consider such a project without the confidence that generous donors will supply the bulk of the funding, and generous volunteers will supply the thousands of man-hours necessary to restore each aircraft. </p>
<p>Thank you all.</p>

<div>
<p>The largest risk to this project is in not having the aircraft sufficiently restored so that it can be dedicated in the Fall of 2016. At a minimum, this means that the aircraft must be fully painted and the new windows put in place. For this to happen, the funding must be secured, the body work must be completed, the primer and paint applied, squadron and squadron and Air Force insignias painted and the windows purchased and installed.</p>
<p>Mitigation strategies that have been put in place include a schedule that includes time for unknowns such as weather and fluctuation in manpower. In addition, work to secure funds and manpower was started in mid 2015.</p>
<p>Overall, there is little risk that the project will not be completed. The restoration of the B-52B is the Museum's top priority in 2016, and the Museum has an excellent track record of completing aircraft projects. The largest, completed between 2009 and 2011, was the relocation of all aircraft and other Heritage Park exhibits from the Museum's first home, when it was located on Kirtland Air Force Base, to its current location. More recently, the Museum successfully completed the full restoration of the <a href=""http://www.nuclearmuseum.org/support/operation-preservation-the-campaign-to-restore-the-planes/b-29-restoration-project/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">B-29 Superfortress</a>, the <a href=""http://www.nuclearmuseum.org/support/operation-preservation-the-campaign-to-restore-the-planes/completed-f-16-fighting-falcon/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">F-16 Fighting Falcon</a> and the <a href=""http://www.nuclearmuseum.org/support/operation-preservation-the-campaign-to-restore-the-planes/completed-sub-sail-restoration/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">USS James K.

<h3>Thank you for your time and consideration!</h3></span></div></div>","Help Bring a Piece of History Back to Life
 The National Museum of Nuclear Science & History, a Smithsonian affiliated, non-profit Museum located in Albuquerque, New Mexico, is restoring its B-52B Stratofortress, serial number 52-0013.  She is one of only four B-models in the world on display for public viewing, the first to air drop a hydrogen bomb and the only B-52B left in existence that has dropped atomic weapons - all during testing.
This enormous restoration initiative is a special project within Operation Preservation, an ongoing campaign to repaint and refurbish the iconic aircraft in the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History’s nine-acre outdoor exhibit area, Heritage Park.
Our Museum's iconic B-52B has experienced the ravages of the southwestern weather, and we would like to ask for your support in paying for the surface preparation and painting of the exterior of the aircraft (a surface area of over 2/3 of an acre). By helping with this behemoth endeavor, your support will:



Celebrate the men and women who designed, built, maintained and flew every B-52 model since the 1950s to today's recent models.

Educate all generations on the historical significance of the B-52B Stratofortress.

Connect Museum visitors with an important part of America's history and provide them with an opportunity to experience a B-52B up close.






The total B-52B restoration cost is expected to be $120,000. Approximately 1/2 of this cost will be paid by this Indiegogo project. The money raised in this campaign will be used for the cosmetic restoration of the fuselage and wings. That is, to purchase the paint ($460) per gallon and primer ($300 per gallon), prepare the airplane's surface and then paint the fuselage and wings. This will also include painting the ""Air Force Special Weapons Center"" insignia on the starboard side and the ""Air Force Systems Command"" on the port side. To learn more about the B-52B surface area calculations and the cost of the paint for this project, please click here. 

If we exceed our campaign goal, we will work to add wheel-chair accessible pathways around the aircraft as well as lighting that will truly bring the airplane to life. In the instance we do not reach our entire goal of $60,000 with this campaign, Museum staff and volunteers will continue to push forward on the restoration. Painting an airplane of this size requires multiple work phases - including preparing the aircraft for paint, application of primer and application of paint - and we would focus on the phases that required less labor costs until sufficient funds are raised.
With a quickly approaching target completion date for the B-52B restoration of August, 2016, we ask that you please consider becoming a member of the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History's B-52B Restoration Team by making a donation through Indiegogo! As a part of the B-52B support team, you will personally help in the preservation of this iconic aircraft.


  About Our B-52B Stratofortress 

The B-52 Stratofortress is a
long-range, subsonic, jet-powered strategic bomber. Built by Boeing – with a
wingspan of 185 ft and weighing 420,000 lbs – B-52 airplanes
have been operated by the United States Air Force since the 1950s and the more
recent models are expected to serve continuously into the future. 


The first
B-52B  - one of only 50 ever made - was delivered to the Strategic Air Command (SAC) in June of 1955, and the B-model was the first in the B-52 series to actually serve with operational bomb wings in the Strategic Air Command. Over the
years, the aircraft has proved itself in combat and peace time readiness. The B-52B – the type of aircraft located at the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History – was the first truly operational version of the Stratofortress that
featured an enhanced reconnaissance capability and was fitted with a
bombing/navigation system, and they remained in service into the mid-1960s when
they were traded in for more modern B-52s.  


“Our B-52 at the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History is truly Albuquerque’s airplane,” said Jim Walther, Museum Director. “This airplane was delivered directly from Boeing to Kirtland in 1955, assigned to the Special Weapons Center at Kirtland Air Force Base, and it was never assigned to another Air Force base.”


The B-52B as it was displayed at the Museum when it was formerly known as the National Atomic Museum and was formerly located on Kirtland Air Force Base (1971-2001).


On April 29, 1955, Kirtland Air
Force Base (KAFB) received its first B-52B Stratofortress (our B-52B), s/n 52-0013. Major Jerome L. Blanchard accepted delivery of the aircraft at the
Boeing Plant in Seattle and piloted the aircraft to KAFB. All crew members were
from the 4925th Test Group. 
The aircraft was among the first
ten B-52Bs delivered to the Air Force. “Old 013” was assigned
to the Air Force Special Weapons Center at Kirtland Air Force Base. Our B-52B conducted many drop tests of inert
weapon shapes to explore weapons separation characteristics at release and to
gather ballistics data.
The aircraft participated in the Redwing Cherokee test, near the Bikini
Atoll.  On May 21, 1956, it became the
first B-52 to drop a live nuclear device and the first aircraft to drop a hydrogen bomb. Our B-52B  also participated in Operation Dominic which took place from April until
November 1962. Operation Dominic saw
the last atmospheric tests, including air drops of nuclear devices. In its
years of service, B-52B, s/n 52-0013, dropped over one dozen live nuclear devices in various
operations.
When the Limited Nuclear Test Ban treaty was signed in 1963, Albuquerque’s B-52B, s/n 52-0013, was removed from the roster and was later delivered to the Museum, formerly known as the National Atomic Museum, in 1971.

Our B-52B when it was assigned on May 21, 1956, to the Air Force Special Weapons Center for Operation Redwing (Cherokee) / TX-15-X1 Hydrogen Bomb test - Fred Island Air Force Base.

Our B-52B was briefly renamed Deterrent I for the Dominic series of nuclear tests in the Pacific in 1962. Shown here with a SAC crew from Sheppard Air Force Base, it had flown to the Pacific for the test series with a crew from Kirtland Air Force Base, which also participated in the tests, as did scientists from Sandia Corporation, the name at that time for Sandia National Laboratories.

    Who We Are




The National Museum of Nuclear Science & History is a Smithsonian Affiliate and is the nation's only congressionally chartered museum in its field. The Museum is nationally accredited though the American Alliance of Museum and is also a member of the Association of Science-Technology Centers. The National Museum of Nuclear Science & History is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.
The National Museum of Nuclear Science & History was established in 1969 as an intriguing place to learn the story of the Atomic Age, from early research of nuclear development through today’s peaceful uses of nuclear technology. The Museum strives to present, through permanent and changing exhibits and displays, the diverse applications of nuclear energy in the past, present and future along with the stories of the field’s pioneers.
This 30,000-sq-ft building and nine-acre outdoor exhibit area display artifacts from Geiger counters, historic medical devices and items from the Manhattan Project to vintage comic books, nostalgic toys and a B-29 Superfortress. The major interior exhibits include Nano, Pioneers of the Atom, Trinity and its Legacy, Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Cold War, Energy Encounter, Nuclear Medicine, Radiation 101 and more. The Museum also hosts Little Albert’s Lab, an area where young, inquisitive minds can explore hands-on science activities.
Heritage Park, the Museum’s nine-acre outdoor exhibit area, is one of the National Museum of Nuclear Science & History’s most popular attractions. With its B-52B Stratofortress, B-29 Superfortress, B-47 Stratojet, F-105D Thunderchief, A-7 Corsair II and F-16 Fighting Falcon, the Museum’s collection is the largest aircraft collection for public viewing in the state of New Mexico.
The Museum’s mission is “to serve as America’s resource for nuclear history and science. The Museum presents exhibits and quality educational programs that convey the diversity of individuals and events that shape the historical and technical context of the nuclear age.” It is truly a place to learn, to imagine, to think and to draw your own conclusions.


Our Success Stories

The most current example of the Museum’s aircraft restoration work can be seen in last year’s Operation Preservation project that involved rescuing our B-29 Superfortress, one of only 17 complete aircraft of its kind left in existence.

Restoration of the B-29 began in April of 2015 under the supervision of Restoration Project Coordinator, Major Jerry Hanks, USMC (Retired), with help from Museum staff and volunteers and was funded by donations received from supporters and entities with personal ties to the Museum and the historic aircraft. The Museum also successfully raised over $44,000 through a Kickstarter campaign to pay for paint and primer.
Restoration included the B-29 receiving a new coat of primer and paint, bodywork to the aircraft, new cockpit windows and the vintage 509th Wing of the Strategic Air Command paint and trim. 
The Museum held a dedication ceremony on Tuesday, August 11, 2015, where dignitaries were present to publicly acknowledge the legacy and historical significance of the B-29 Superfortress.

The aircraft once belonged to the ‘The TACOS’, the New Mexico Air National Guard 150th Fighter Wing. It was rescued from the Sandia National Laboratories Rocket Sled Track and restored for static display. The restoration included restoring the TACO trim and tail insignia to acknowledge the 50+ year legacy and historical significance of the TACOS. The restoration even included lighting the aircraft's navigation, vertical tail illumination and landing lights.



The TACOS were honored in the restoration of this airplane because of their legacy and contributions to our country. This division of the New Mexico Air National Guard has flown combat operations in Korea, Vietnam, Bosnia and Iraq and was mobilized and flew combat air patrol sorties throughout the United States following the attacks on September 11, 2011. The 150th Fighter Wing TACOS operated the F-16 from 1992 to 2003.
Restoration of this iconic aircraft was supervised by Restoration Project Coordinator, Major Jerry Hanks, USMC (Retired), and was completed with the help of volunteers from Sandia National Laboratories, Kirtland Air Force Base, Museum volunteers and members of the CNM Aviation Maintenance Technology program and Service-Learning program.
The Museum held a dedication ceremony for the newly restored F-16 on November 5, 2014. U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich; U.S. Senator Tom Udall; and Brigadier General Andrew Salas, Adjutant General for the New Mexico Air National Guard were present to publicly acknowledge the restoration as well as the legacy and historical significance of the TACOS.


USS James K. Polk Submarine Sail



Our Museum's submarine sail during restoration.

Our Museum's submarine sail after restoration.The National Museum of Nuclear Science & History successfully completed the restoration of the iconic USS James K. Polk SSN 645 nuclear submarine sail in the fall of 2014.
This truly historic object, measuring 30 feet high by nine feet wide and weighing 53 tons, was acquired by the Museum in 1999, and restoration began in the spring of 2014. Named after the 11th president of the United States, the USS James K. Polk was commissioned as SSBN 645 in 1966. The James K Polk was later converted into an attack submarine and re-designated SSN 645, making for an illustrious 33-year career.Under the supervision of Fernando, retired Process Engineer from Intel, and with help from Museum staff, volunteers and various partners, the submarine exhibit was a hub of activity throughout the summer of 2014. The completed submarine sail is now on permanent display in the Museum’s Heritage Park.



The Excitement


""Clever names for classified programs like Operation Redwing and Dominic, and Code Name Cherokee recall the gallant days of the Cold War and the nuclear arms race.  The National Museum of Nuclear Science & History's B-52B aircraft is an icon of that era and took part in those programs.  This remarkable and totally intact aircraft is the largest artifact at the Museum, and we are proud to restore it its former glory."" - Restoration Project Coordinator, Major Jerry Hanks, USMC (Retired)
""The National Museum of Nuclear Science & History has been the proud caretaker of this historic airplane for more than 40 years. Our B-52B is emblematic of the Cold War and the arms race between the U.S. and USSR and is an incredibly important part of America's history."" - Museum Director, Jim Walther



""This aircraft played a large part in the development of our nuclear weapons program and should be the cornerstone of Heritage Park."" - Tom St. Aubin, Museum and Restoration Volunteer



""Every politician now is talking about restoring us to greatness.  But with our bomber, we mean it. It's history worth preserving."" - Gary Hoe, Museum Docent



""Since starting it's service with the U.S. Air Force in 1955, no other bomber in the world has stood guard or has served as long as the B-52 bomber. For more than over half a century from the Cold War thru Vietnam, Desert Shield on to Desert Strom, Iraq Freedom on to Enduring Freedom. No plane has been feared by our enemies like the B-52. It's presence alone is able to strike fear into those who wish us harm. As quoted by the U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff when the bomber was first rolled out in 1954, 'The Long Rifle was the weapon of its day. Today this B-52 is the Long Rifle of the Air Age.'"" - Jose Juvera, Museum Docent

Your Support/Our Gratitude 




The National Museum of Nuclear Science & History staff, board of trustees and volunteers all passionately believe in the mission of our Museum, and we know its past and future success depends on the generosity of our donors, volunteers and supporters.  Our heartfelt thanks go out to all of you.
Operation Preservation, The Campaign to Restore the Planes in Heritage Park is a massive undertaking, with the B-52B Stratofortress being only one of the five aircraft needing to be restored.  It would be impossible for the Museum to consider such a project without the confidence that generous donors will supply the bulk of the funding, and generous volunteers will supply the thousands of man-hours necessary to restore each aircraft. 
Thank you all.

Risks and Challenges

The largest risk to this project is in not having the aircraft sufficiently restored so that it can be dedicated in the Fall of 2016. At a minimum, this means that the aircraft must be fully painted and the new windows put in place. For this to happen, the funding must be secured, the body work must be completed, the primer and paint applied, squadron and squadron and Air Force insignias painted and the windows purchased and installed.
Mitigation strategies that have been put in place include a schedule that includes time for unknowns such as weather and fluctuation in manpower. In addition, work to secure funds and manpower was started in mid 2015.
Overall, there is little risk that the project will not be completed. The restoration of the B-52B is the Museum's top priority in 2016, and the Museum has an excellent track record of completing aircraft projects. The largest, completed between 2009 and 2011, was the relocation of all aircraft and other Heritage Park exhibits from the Museum's first home, when it was located on Kirtland Air Force Base, to its current location. More recently, the Museum successfully completed the full restoration of the B-29 Superfortress, the F-16 Fighting Falcon and the USS James K. Polk SSN 645 nuclear submarine sail.

</p><p><b>LANGUAGE
APP</b></p>
<p>The importance of language education has become
something that is disregarded and considered to be insignificant. Many Nigerian
languages are threatened by extinction. Most of the youths are unable to speak
their native dialects. They do not understand the importance of knowing and
understanding ones’ origin. Often when asked where you are from the second
question is more often than not “Do you speak the language?”, and I feel it is
a shame when the response is no.</p>
<p>Language is a powerful symbol of one's identity.
Much of the cultural, spiritual, and intellectual life of a people is
experienced through language. This ranges from prayers, myths, ceremonies,
poetry, oratory, and technical vocabulary to everyday greetings, conversational
styles, humor, terms for habits, and behaviors. When a language is lost, all of
this must be refashioned in the new language-with different words, sounds, and
grammar- if it is to be kept at all. For these reasons, among others, it is very
important to the community itself that its language survive.</p>
<p><b>PROBLEM:</b></p>
<p>There are many young Nigerians who can communicate
excellently in English language but find it difficult to speak Igbo, Yoruba and
other indigenous languages. These youths put themselves at a loss, because they
rely on building relationships and understandings with foreign countries to
improve the Nigerian economy when they are unable to understand their own
culture. Instead of becoming leaders in their country, instead they become
followers of the ways in western world, which will always keep them behind. In
an increasingly globalized and interconnected world, Nigerian and their future
workforce will be at a loss if they lack language skills and cultural awareness,
missing out on opportunities to grow the economy by simply expecting everyone
to speak English.</p>
<p>Although for many people it's important to know a
major national or international language, that doesn't mean they must abandon
their mother tongue. Children who grow up speaking two or more languages learn
those languages just as well as children who grow up speaking only one
language.</p>
<p>Another issue is that while the languages are
endangered, many elders of many tribes still encourage tribalism. This is
simply a segregation of a lost society, which is was the cause of the Nigerian
civil war and must be stopped. If Nigeria is going to survive the test of time
and advance in the direction of economic and industrial development, ethnic and
tribal mentality must be eroded. I believe education ought to take precedence
over tribal and ethnic alignment by broadening the mental horizon of ones
perception about leadership as it relates to effective governance.</p>
<p><b>WHY
I CREATED THE LANGUAGE APP:</b></p>
<p>I believe that multilingualism is a necessity
especially in Nigeria. Whether viewed from the financial or social aspect,
being able to communicate in various indigenous or foreign languages helps to
make ‘real’ connection with people and opens up a number of opportunities. For
businesses, having multilingual employees is essential to develop and sustain a
strong footing in the economy. Therefore most companies look for candidates
with language skills. As an employer, it will help encourage staff performance,
improve customer services, and increase revenue for your company. Knowing more
than one language means a person has more than one way of seeing things; they
are a more able than not to think out of the box and be more innovative. I
believe indigenous language education in Nigeria will increase the value put
into tourism. Different tribes will be able to come as not just Igbo, Yoruba,
Hausa, Efik but as Nigerians who see the value, beauty, and cultural diversity
in their country and want to nurture it.</p>
<p>The Nigerian Language Policy on education was
created to encourage the teaching and learning of indigenous and international
languages (apart from English), which will achieve national unity. Nigerians
will consider themselves as one instead of forming segregated groups based on
tribe. However, the implementation of this policy has experienced numerous
difficulties. Many schools cannot incorporate indigenous or foreign languages
into their curriculum due to the lack of experienced teachers and the inability
to recognize the importance of language education. Therefore indigenous and
foreign languages, apart from English, have been abandoned. A better way of
language education is required.</p>
<p><b>WHAT
THE APP DOES:</b></p>
<p>The language learning app is a robust, colorful,
fun, easy to understand and exciting language application that at this moment
consists of 5 different languages preinstalled; Yoruba, Igbo, Hausa, English
and French. Though more languages will be added based on customer demand, the
focus as of now is on these 3 indigenous languages coupled with English and
French because they are the more dominant of the many languages in Nigeria.</p>
<p>The application consist of various characters and
voice command incorporated into the Rastvor Labs application in order to make
it interactive ensuring that the individual using the app will not be bored.</p>
<p>The application was developed to make learning the
thus stated languages more accessible. Learning pad can be used by the teachers
as an aid during language classes and also it can be used by the students as a
learning aid. Parents are encouraged to request for the specific languages that
peeks their interest, if they do not want all 5. Using Rastvor Labs application
will improve the unity amongst Nigerians and improve our understanding of one
another. Through innovative technology, applied psychometrics, and a learning
sciences team anchored by Rastvor Labs, we seek to empower a whole new
generation of learners.</p>
<p>We want to establish a large regular customer base,
and will therefore concentrate on elementary and high school all across
Nigeria, which will be the dominant target market. This will establish a
healthy, consistent revenue base to ensure stability of the business.</p>
<p>We have created a language app that is to be used by
educational institutions and individuals to teach and learn the languages of
other tribes apart from their own. Most cultures appreciate when someone
considered an outsider understands and speaks the native tongue, it breaks down
the barrier between people allowing the so called outsider be welcomed. This is
what our language app will do to Nigeria.</p>
<p>The language app so far consist of five languages;
Igbo, Yoruba, Hausa, English and French. </p>
<p><b>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</b></p>
<p>There are no risks. The project will
thrive on demand. We already have a number of schools and parents that are
interested in purchasing the app.</p><p><b>WHAT WE NEED</b></p>
<p>In total, we need $7,000, for this Project,
basically to pay the programmer, website designer, language experts and to for
some Tabs for the testing and deployment of the application. Any other funding
as they say will take care of itself. The breakdown is as follows:</p>

<div><i><a href=""http://www.theroamingsanctuary.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.theroamingsanctuary.org</a></i></div> <p>Thanks to all those that contributed to the success of the previous Safe Shelter for Tibetans in Nepal campaign.  The video shows just how well the project went and it is our gift to all contributors.</p>
<p>Nepal is home to several Tibetan refugee villages, that are spread throughout the country.  Our destination is Jampaling Settlement, which sits 45 minutes outside the small western city of Pokhara.  The village is home to approximately 750 Tibetan refugees.  </p>
<p>Safe shelter is still the priority.  Many families live with leaking roofs, crumbling walls or cannot afford shelter of their own.  Being refugees within Nepal, they have no legal citizenship, no rights and very few opportunities to earn income.  There is no indoor plumbing, no heat and very little reliable electricity.</p>
<p>We are returning October 7th, 2016, to Jampaling Settlement.</p>
<p>The Roaming Sanctuary would like to raise $5000.00 to provide 6 families with a safe, dry, clean dwelling.  As a result of the devastating  earthquake of 2015, there's been very little help for the Tibetan refugees.  The more we raise, the more families we can help.  Please help us help others, with your generous gift.</p>

</div></div>","Safe Shelter Part 2
www.theroamingsanctuary.org Thanks to all those that contributed to the success of the previous Safe Shelter for Tibetans in Nepal campaign.  The video shows just how well the project went and it is our gift to all contributors.
Nepal is home to several Tibetan refugee villages, that are spread throughout the country.  Our destination is Jampaling Settlement, which sits 45 minutes outside the small western city of Pokhara.  The village is home to approximately 750 Tibetan refugees.  
Safe shelter is still the priority.  Many families live with leaking roofs, crumbling walls or cannot afford shelter of their own.  Being refugees within Nepal, they have no legal citizenship, no rights and very few opportunities to earn income.  There is no indoor plumbing, no heat and very little reliable electricity.
We are returning October 7th, 2016, to Jampaling Settlement.
The Roaming Sanctuary would like to raise $5000.00 to provide 6 families with a safe, dry, clean dwelling.  As a result of the devastating  earthquake of 2015, there's been very little help for the Tibetan refugees.  The more we raise, the more families we can help.  Please help us help others, with your generous gift.
www.theroamingsanctuary.org







The Roaming Sanctuary will document each step of the project, and the website will provide updates on each phase as it occurs.  Our gift of total integrity is for everyone that contributes to The Roaming Sanctuary.  The gift of seeing the projects and the families that you've positively affected, and the love that you spread with your gift.  Thank you for your continued support.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Who I am in a nutshell: </p>
<p>I have a business background and a huge passion to teach children. I am also a single mom who wants to be there for her little one and at the same time provide for him.</p>
<p>I have a rich experience of over 7 years with children of all ages so I thought about combining my passion and my knowledge and start something great that would benefit me and my baby and at the same time other parents and their children.</p>
<p>As a parent (or as a single parent) I know how hard and expensive it is to find quality care for your littles ones, as parents we want to make sure that our little ones are growing and developing by getting the right education they need but without breaking our banks. I am raising money to create a preschool that offers a high quality fun artistic educational environment for the little one that is also affordable for their parents.</p>
<p>The preschool is going to be artistic based, where the children will learn through music, dance, paint, crafts and other activities. The program will also allow the children to learn through experience, and make everyday a learning adventure for them. It will have a lot of different rich activities throughout the day to keep the children engaged and motivated to learn and play. It will also have a language program to help children learn other languages at a very early stage.</p>
<p>It will have different workshops (theater, music, dance, art, and others). We will have a nice outdoor space to allow the kids to get fresh air and get dirty and a science lab. Kids will spend their day moving from a workshop to another. </p>
<p>Also, the preschool will have a designated area for those parents who work from home, parents could sit and work while enjoying a cup of coffee while their kids play and interact with their peers.</p>
<p>With your contributions, we can make a difference and together we can build a better tomorrow! By contributing, you give a child the best gift that they could ever ask for, the gift of learning! </p>

</p><p><b>Keeping your roots
alive!</b></p>
<p>My name is Gbemisola Isimi and I am the founder and CEO of CultureTree
Ltd. </p>
<p>CultureTree is on
a mission and that mission is to preserve and teach children indigenous
Nigerian languages. Without sounding overly dramatic, it has become
increasingly obvious that we need to claim back our birth right and that is the
language of our forefathers. We can be proud of our children’s good English and
pronunciation but we must not let our mother tongue become a foreign language
to them. We should be even prouder when they can not only understand our
language but also speak it proficiently. </p>
<p>Many Nigerian parents
are on-board and are making efforts to teach and expose their children to their
mother tongue but for various different reasons the practicalities of introducing
a second language at home can be akin to playing darts with spaghetti (if you
catch my drift). That is where
CultureTree comes in! </p>
<p>Our method is
simple. We make the language learning process a fun, interactive and positive
experience. Children are more likely to be curious when presented with songs,
rhymes, stories and games and therefore are more likely to learn and retain
knowledge. </p>
<p>We launched a YouTube
channel aptly named ‘<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/c/CultureTreeTVYoruba"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CultureTreeTV
Yoruba</a>’ with 2 animated Yoruba Nursery Rhyme videos on 1<sup>st</sup> April
2016. To date, this channel now has 5 animated Yoruba Nursery Rhyme videos and
one read-aloud picture story. The channel has met with great approval and has gained over 200 subscribers in a very short space of time.</p>

and software we hope to purchase detailed below).</p>
<p><span>·<span> 
</span></span>A comprehensive CultureTree website.</p>
<p>Our educational materials will cover all early learning
skills and developmental milestones for children, namely: <br/>
<br/>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hello, My name is Donna Ghanney, CEO of Kingdom Empowerment, Inc.</p>
<p>Kingdom Empowerment, Inc. was established to educate individuals in the areas of coaching, mentoring, leadership, business and nonprofit startups, budgeting and finances, health, spiritual growth, trafficking and many other areas in support of providing social, mental and physical sustainability globally.</p>
<p>I was inspired to empower individuals to be successful when visiting Ghana West Africa in the Central Region in 2012. I visited an area called the Zongo and was able to see first hand how young ladies from 12 and up were given over into marriage or trafficking. The underlying area and cause for this being acceptable was poverty conditions, and living in an environment that deems it acceptable. Later, when I returned to America, and walked in impoverished areas, I learned that the same stigma existed here. This provoked me to develop programs to educate, empower, and equip individuals globally to be successful in every area of their lives. Our programs are designed to encourage and motivate individuals to allow transformation to take place in their lives.  We also are inspired to help them continue the pace after the seminar by providing one on one coaching, tools, and resources to help them continue the pace.

Hello, My name is Donna Ghanney, CEO of Kingdom Empowerment, Inc.
Kingdom Empowerment, Inc. was established to educate individuals in the areas of coaching, mentoring, leadership, business and nonprofit startups, budgeting and finances, health, spiritual growth, trafficking and many other areas in support of providing social, mental and physical sustainability globally.
I was inspired to empower individuals to be successful when visiting Ghana West Africa in the Central Region in 2012. I visited an area called the Zongo and was able to see first hand how young ladies from 12 and up were given over into marriage or trafficking. The underlying area and cause for this being acceptable was poverty conditions, and living in an environment that deems it acceptable. Later, when I returned to America, and walked in impoverished areas, I learned that the same stigma existed here. This provoked me to develop programs to educate, empower, and equip individuals globally to be successful in every area of their lives. Our programs are designed to encourage and motivate individuals to allow transformation to take place in their lives.  We also are inspired to help them continue the pace after the seminar by providing one on one coaching, tools, and resources to help them continue the pace. Our goals is to see that every seed that is planted is utilized and maximized to its greatest extent when we provide any financial support to help women remain sustainable in their vision.

What We Need & What You Get
We need monies to continue the development of high-end technologies to support our educational initiatives.
We need monies to help individuals who would like to attend high end seminars to be able to attend the events for free.

Individuals, Business Owners, Vendors and Advertisers will receive recognition for their contributions.  You are allowed to share your logos, business cards, and other materials with the women with provide the seminars to.
My main expenses for this project include:
* Airfare (Texas, Oklahoma, Florida, Atlanta, Ghana, Nigeria)

* Translator fees
*  Visa fees
* Facilitation for 5 events (Texas, Oklahoma, Florida, Atlanta, Ghana)
* Basic expenses while in (Texas, Oklahoma, Florida, Atlanta, Ghana)
* Technologies
* Speaker Engagement Fees (Subject Matter Experts)
* Materials, packaging, and shipping cost.
To cover these preliminary costs I need $125,000.  Anything raised in addition to my goal will be used for toward 2017 Seminars.

I have worked in the agricultural field for more than 20 years in South Korea and New Zealand as a Veterinarian/Farm Consultant.


I have always dreamed of helping out and feeding poor, undernourished, hungry people of the third world countries. Due to global warming and the natural disasters that will become more and more prevalent, worldwide food crisis is bound to happen sooner or later.  This is why educating and providing farming skills to the people of the third world countries is so crucial and quite urgent.
There are many senior retirees in the U.S who are ready and willing to devote their lives in helping the poor, but don't know where or how to. This is why I am planning on running the Agricultural Mission Center to train/educate missionary volunteers all about farming. Several pastors I've met are already supportive of my plan and have asked me for some tips on farming broiler chickens, hens, pigs, and goats.
   What We Need & What You Get I'm currently in the process of negotiating with an investor to purchase a small area of land in Long Island, NY, so he can provide free leasing for the Agricultural Mission Center(AM Center).

<Setting up the AM Center>
1) Building a mobile home including power, natural gas, water/sewer connect
2) Start farming e.g- goats, broiler chickens, hens, pigs, vegetables, etc.
3) Network with churches to recruit retirees who are willing to help and learn about farming.

<Next Steps>
1) At the AM Center, a prayer ministry called the House of Prayer(HOP) will be set up specifically for the purpose of praying for this world mission. We strongly encourage pastors to join AM Center with their church volunteers to help lead the members spiritually through prayers and guidance.
2) After the completion of the AM Center and HOP, the center will be open for seniors to live, learn, work and have fellowship. 
The Impact
 In 2050, the world population will grow up to 9 billion, and food necessity will be doubled compared to current food consumption. If the third world countries don't start preparing for food shortage right this moment, the mass exodus/emigration will put the entire world in chaos.

By training volunteer retirees on farming, they will be able to go overseas and provide assistance to the third world countries through educating them on producing their own food and to self sustain. 
    Risks & Challenges

Main risks are 1) failure of land leasing, 2) not recruiting enough volunteers.

Even though it may seem like a long shot considering the adversity, I am hopeful this dream will manifest and make the change. The dream consists of a  fairly simple solution, to get my people on the right track by means of a soccer ball. Soccer (Futbol) is the sport that Salvadorians exude passion for through their pores, any child would dream of being able to play on the street, let alone, in a league. But, like most underprivileged kids, dreams as such are too farfetched, and sadly most won't have the luxury to play with a proper soccer ball. If we could introduce soccer balls to poverty stricken areas maybe we can curve and inspire kids not to turn to gangs and violence. If we can touch and inspire one child then we have already won, and that alone will make this dream a reality.</p>
<br/><p><br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The idea is to raise $10k in order to purchase about 500 to 800 soccer balls along with other equipment needed. The equipment and balls will then be donated to youths in the most poverty stricken areas of El Salvador, with the help of fesaelsalvador.org. Twenty percent of the proceeds will go into producing a video documenting this experience thus creating a wider range of awareness for our ongoing battle against violence. Along in this Journey we will collaborate with a few different Salvadorian Soccer Players and artist to create some cool perks for those who donate. We will be adding limited edition merchandise that you can get in return for you donations.<br/></p> <ul>

one lesson that I strongly believed changed me was the law of attraction, which

someone and saying “great morning.” In
this class I learn to deal with drama and death. And to never let any of that touch my heart

learned how to create an LLC… how to create my own company.  I can truly say when I entered this class I

year athletic teams across the country get ready to compete in their annual

competition. This Captain has encompassed the enormous task of leading

(Together Everyone Achieves Miracles) have used their ONE BREATH to Breathe Life into literally thousands of boys and young men in ""hoodz"" across the country.



 What We Need & What You Get

With your donation, we can enroll our goal of 100 boys into the The M.A.N. ""One Breath"" Leadership Academy. Each scholarship tuition is $120



Session Outcomes:  By the end of these sessions, participants will be able to 

utilize
sports and music to help transform “boyz n da hoodz” into responsible men in the Neighborhood and Community. These responsible men will recognize the power of utilizing their “One Breath” to breathe into a “lifeless”
community. They will also use the “One Breath"" 12 Step Game Plan to modify destructive social and emotional behaviors into healthy behavioral habits.
 

How Much Funding Do We Need?

The M.A.N. (Manhood Academy Network) ""One Breath"" Leadership Academy will induct 100 captains and co-captians of boys' basketball teams in New York City. After 12 weeks each boy will be inducted into The M.A.N. Society where they will receive ongoing (life-long) mentoring and coaching. In addition, these young men are required to complete the last step which is service. They are responsible for recruiting another captain to attend The M.A.N. ""One Breath"" Leadership Academy. This process is done continuously. The initiative will be conducted in the following areas: NY, NJ, PA, DC, ATL, and LA (Los Angeles). The first round of funding is for 100 captains in NY. Additional funds raised over the initial $12,000 will go towards the tuition of newly recruited captains in other cities. 
    
The Impact
 ""Coach"" Gustus has a 40-year successful track record of transforming the lives of ""boyz n da hood"". He has been recognized by President Barack Obama for his outstanding life time achievements. He has traveled across the country mentoring student athletes and working with street gangs from NYC to Los Angeles. He has a proven track record for successfully ""changing"" the mindset and frame of mind which led to improving the quality of life for boys and girls living in ""da hood"". 




Testimonials

What have I learned from Coach Gustus’ workshops?
By: Stacey
Student
“Since
I entered the class in January I have transformed tremendously. The
one lesson that I strongly believed changed me was the law of attraction, which
was one of the first things I learned. It made me think positive at all times, for example walking up to
someone and saying “great morning.” In
this class I learn to deal with drama and death. And to never let any of that touch my heart
and continue to live life.  I have even
learned how to create an LLC… how to create my own company.  I can truly say when I entered this class I
was a seed which grew and will continue to grow.""


By: Marco 
H.S. Student
“There is no doubt that Coach Gustus’ Life
Skills class should be expanded.   This class
helps us as students to see where we are right now in school.  By being in this class it made us realize
that we have to change.  Some of us may
not like that but one of Gustus’ principles teaches us that when change is
necessary, not to change can be destructive. 
This is what we the students are trying to live by.  

We need this class very badly because some of
us need a person like Coach Gustus in our lives (a father figure).   He directs us on the path we should go on and
reminds us not to get distracted by our friends in the hallways when it’s time
to go to class.  It is not always easy to put what he
teaches into play, because it’s a
process and we have to practice it.   I have some
fellow seniors who do not have this class, but come into the class to sit in,
because they want to hear some of Coach’s wisdom and knowledge.  What I see in Coach Gustus I rarely see in
other men.  For that, others should
experience being in this class for themselves.”
    
Risks & Challenges


Each
year athletic teams across the country get ready to compete in their annual
season. Days and hours are dedicated to practicing and getting prepared to have
a successful season. As the coaches prepare to lead the team from the bench, a
captain of the team is usually selected by the team and the Coach. This athlete is expected to lead the team going
to and from games, while in school, and when the team goes on the road for
competition. This Captain has encompassed the enormous task of leading
12-15 of his peers. In addition, he has to become the liaison between the
coaching staff and his team mates. This is
an awesome task and responsibility bestowed on these young men. It is
an incredibly difficult task for “boyz n da hood” to manage. As a result of the
conditions placed in ""America’s Hoodz"", these captains are confronted with enormous negative challenges. The M.A.N. “One Breath” Leadership Academy addresses these
challenges by teaching, coaching and preparing the captains on how to
successfully navigate and function as a leader within ""da hood"".

Cambodia, one of the poorest countries in South East Asia, the
government provides only four hours of state run education <span>per
day.  With just the government education, children often lack basic
reading, writing, and math skills.  They also often show little
responsibility for their actions and demonstrate poor communication
skills and attitudes towards others. Many end up with little hope for
decent employment and face a bleak future.

In
Bospo Village, Cambodia, KNGO provides free supplimentary education
for local impoverished children.  This education, including essential
English classes, gives the children many opportunities for a brighter
future.  Thanks to donations in the past, KNGO has been a successful
organization.  However, ongoing funding is needed to continue and

We
are Innis Snelling, Omer Zigdon and Ralph Tiemann. 
While backpacking throughout Southeast Asia, we learned about
funding issues at the non-governmental organization, KNGO
Cambodia.  We are determined to help KNGO and are
fundraising on behalf of its founder, Mr. Sun Saveth.

In
Cambodia, one of the poorest countries in South East Asia, the
government provides only four hours of state run education per
day.  With just the government education, children often lack basic
reading, writing, and math skills.  They also often show little
responsibility for their actions and demonstrate poor communication
skills and attitudes towards others. Many end up with little hope for
decent employment and face a bleak future.
Khmer New
Generation Organization (KNGO) was created to change exactly that.

In
Bospo Village, Cambodia, KNGO provides free supplimentary education
for local impoverished children.  This education, including essential
English classes, gives the children many opportunities for a brighter
future.  Thanks to donations in the past, KNGO has been a successful
organization.  However, ongoing funding is needed to continue and
expand the programs.






Goals

The
primary goal is to raise money so that KNGO can continue to operate
as it has in the past.  As the school is run completely by donations
by others, fundraisers like these help a great deal for the continuation
of the school.  Newly raised money will be used for teacher
salaries and administration costs.
The secondary goal is to expand the school.  Currently, 450 children from six to twenty years old are receiving FREE education at KNGO.  However, there are still 550 more children hoping to get access to the free education.  If this goal is reached, it will help build new classrooms, buy new computers, and pay for more teachers.

How We Will Spend Your Money 



In
order to keep the school in operation and potentially expand the
school, we are hoping to raise $10,000.  For a better understanding
of where your money will go, see below.

Primary Goals:

$30 - One month of funding for 10 students
$15- Weekly school supplies
$60 - A part time teacher's salary for one month
$120 - A full time teacher's salary for one month


----------------------------------------------------------------------
Secondary Goals:

$490 - One new computer (13 needed)
$2197 - The building of a new classroom

 Will My Donation Matter?
 
A
donation of any size would greatly help the KNGO to
continue to provide exceptional free education for the poor children
of Bospo Village and the surrounding areas.  The education that KNGO
provides includes: English literacy, Khmer literacy, Mathematics,
computer programming, primary health education, community
environmental awareness and vocational skills training.

Any amount of money (great or small) will help to fund day-to-day schooling.
  I Can't Donate - What Can I Do?


We are constantly seeking volunteers to assist our Khmer teachers with our English literacy program. Regardless of whether you have teaching experience or not, the interaction volunteers have with our children makes a huge impact on their development.
If you decide to volunteer, not only will it positively affect the development of our children, but you will gain a rewarding and unforgettable life experience.",1.0,0,"1 Campaign

At that time, I also started an educational business in Sydney called Kindifarm and together they went on to become Australia's leading farm animal and dog safety education programs, teaching well <b>over 2 million children</b>. </p><blockquote>This meant that I also became a leader of a highly energetic team which allowed the business to gain momentum and grow outside my own strengths and skills. </blockquote><p></p><div>

<p><br/></p>
<p>Additionally, in the past twelve months alone I have attended <b>Brendan Burchard's Experts Academy</b> (U.S. based world leading expert in training authors, speakers and coaches), trained with <b>Kerwin Rae</b> (an Australian world leader in growing services on line), attended <b>Andy Harrington's Speaker's Academy</b> (UK based world leader in public speaking and video/stage training), and more.</p>
<p>Therefore, much of the training and skills I need to move Dog Safety for Kids to the digital classroom have been undertaken.</p>
<blockquote>I have been training with the worlds best to be the worlds best in delivering this critical program.</blockquote>
<p>So, now we have great experience in teaching, running a team and successful business, developing skills in the digital medium, and talent in speaking and training on-line.</p>
<p>So what do we need the money for?</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1430610/files/20150430162818-black_board_4a.jpg?1430436498"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p>We need to get that wealth of knowledge onto video tapes to be cut and edited into an educational module that is going to be delivered, together with all supporting material, world wide via an on-line membership program.</p>
<p>We need money to:</p>
<p>     •<b>Contribute to overheads for the next 12 months including:</b> broadband,                    Infusionsoft (automated customer contact) and Customer Hub (on-line                        subscription host).</p>
<p>     •<b>IT support:</b> Infusionsoft and Customer Hub  advanced strategy, setup and 12            months ongoing support; social media and web-site overhaul and 12 months                ongoing support.</p>
<p>     •<b>Video equipment:</b> 2 x video cameras; microphone integration; sound mixer;                lights; booms; glide-cam; computer and editing programs;  iPads; and other                associated equipment.</p>
<p>     •<b>Video Production:</b> Engaging a Producer and film crew for the initial 20 x 5                 minute, 6 x 15 minute and 2 x 30 minute modules; and Editor for post                             production.</p>

<br/><blockquote>I am sure you noticed when watching our intro video on Indiegogo that our present video production and presentation needs improvement! </blockquote>
<p>The <b>impact of this Indiegogo crowdfunding is going to dramatically improve this</b>, after all, we don't want to distract teachers, parents and children with poor filming, sound and editing.</p>
<p><b>Engaging crew for the initial filming</b> will allow a speedy launch of the on-line class room as well as training our team to reduce future ongoing costs. </p>
<p><b>The purchase of in-house video and editing equipment is essential</b> in allowing us to film on a budget. We are filming with dogs and children, both notoriously hard to hold to time restraints, I know as I have worked with both for 23 years.  </p>
<p>Crowdfunding will also <b>allow us to engage experts in Infusionsoft and Customer Hub for the initial advanced set-up</b>. This will speed up the launch of this program and deliver it in the best manner from day one.  </p>
<p><b>Ongoing support</b> over the next twelve months with Infusionsoft, Customer Hub, the web site and social media will allow us to focus on what we are best at whilst maximising our reach.</p>
<blockquote><b>So, crowdfunding is not only going to ensure we launch the Dog Safety for Kids on-line classroom, but also allow us to launch earlier, on a global platform, and in the best quality. </b></blockquote>

<p><b>The second risk</b> is not getting known by teachers, parents and businesses. To make a lasting impact on each region, we need to achieve a high uptake of the program into schools.</p>
<p><b>Our final risk</b> is that kindergartens and schools face <b>limited funding</b>.  </p>
<p>To meet these challenges one of our goals is the engage parents, local business and larger corporations to sponsor this program in schools and kindergartens as part of their community involvement (and exposure).<br/>Parents can sponsor their school or kindergarten; Local business can sponsor a local area or suburb, and a corporation can introduce the program to an entire city, or more.</p>

<blockquote><b>Thank you very much for your time and consideration with our Indiegogo Dog Safety for Kids on-line classroom launch.</b></blockquote>

</blockquote>
</div>
</div>
</div></div>","My name is Bryce Chapman and my team and I have been teaching Dog Safety for Kids since 1992. The aim of our program is to educate children so they can be safer around dogs at home, at a friends or relatives house and out in the community. We do this by teaching children how dogs communicate, how to see signs that a dogs behaviour is changing, how and when to stay away from dogs, how to ask, approach and pat someones dog, what to do in an emergency, and much much more. As we head into our 24th year of teaching Dog Safety for Kids in Australian Schools we are now drawing on that experience to launch this essential program into the digital age. Thanks to improved high speed broadband connections into schools, kindergartens and households we can now reach more children throughout the entire world. After all, it's a global problem we are fighting.Dog bites and attacks  = a global problem These shocking statistics are getting worse!     *  The number of people admitted to Accident and Emergency (ER) in the UK as a          result of dog attacks has risen by 43% in the past 4 years.      *  Even worse, in London there has been a 119% rise in hospitalisation of under 18          year olds as a result of dog attacks.       *  In the United States, the fifth most frequent cause of visits to the ER with                      children's activities is from dog injuries and there has been an 86% increase in          dog bite hospitalisation from 1993 to 2008.      *  Shockingly, there has been an 82% increase in fatalities from dog attacks from          the 1980's to 2012! Now you can see why we are so passionate about launching this new on-line classroom. We have been doing an incredible job here is Sydney, but it's now time to teach our program to the rest of the world. ""We cannot stand by and have these dreadful numbers increase any longer"". Our new Classroom will work like this:      •Teachers, parents, dog owners and sponsors can access the membership site       from on our web site www.dogsafetyforkids.com        •""Kick Start"" Membership for the classroom is FREE and we aim to provide                    valuable tips and strategies on Dog Safety for Kids in short and precise 3 - 5                minute video lessons. For those wanting to jump start their dog safety                            strategies at home or in the classroom this is a great way to start.      •For those looking for the complete classroom program an easy upgrade to                    full Membership is just a few clicks away.     •Membership starts at US$47 for an individual or family household; then it's                  US$197 for a kindergarten, child care centre or playgroup and US$297 for an              entire elementary or primary school.      **These are Early Bird prices available during this launch**
     •Each registered member can access the classroom on-demand over the 12                  month period. This allows teachers to easily schedule the program into their                calendar; year after year.      •The goal is to remove all boundaries to education by making it affordable,                  accessible, easy to use.      •Membership gives full access to the entire B.E.S.A.F.E. program including                    exclusive additional Kick Start lessons, Do-It-Yourself video-integrated                          lesson plans and complete Done-For-You lessons.     • All lessons are Outcome Based Education.     •Supporting PDF downloads, extension and follow up activities are included.     •Lessons will be upgraded and advanced plug-ins offered as they roll out.The following video shows a brief overview of the B.E.S.A.F.E. program.The following video demonstrates how a live kindergarten lesson provides our foundation for the all new on-line classroom.Well, as you can see by now we have been teaching children Dog Safety for Kids since 1992. At that time, I also started an educational business in Sydney called Kindifarm and together they went on to become Australia's leading farm animal and dog safety education programs, teaching well over 2 million children. This meant that I also became a leader of a highly energetic team which allowed the business to gain momentum and grow outside my own strengths and skills. 
The following video shows one of our live Kindergarten visits which was aired on Animal Hospital, Chanel Nine (Australia).



Additionally, in the past twelve months alone I have attended Brendan Burchard's Experts Academy (U.S. based world leading expert in training authors, speakers and coaches), trained with Kerwin Rae (an Australian world leader in growing services on line), attended Andy Harrington's Speaker's Academy (UK based world leader in public speaking and video/stage training), and more.
Therefore, much of the training and skills I need to move Dog Safety for Kids to the digital classroom have been undertaken.
I have been training with the worlds best to be the worlds best in delivering this critical program.
So, now we have great experience in teaching, running a team and successful business, developing skills in the digital medium, and talent in speaking and training on-line.
So what do we need the money for?



We need to get that wealth of knowledge onto video tapes to be cut and edited into an educational module that is going to be delivered, together with all supporting material, world wide via an on-line membership program.
We need money to:
     •Contribute to overheads for the next 12 months including: broadband,                    Infusionsoft (automated customer contact) and Customer Hub (on-line                        subscription host).
     •IT support: Infusionsoft and Customer Hub  advanced strategy, setup and 12            months ongoing support; social media and web-site overhaul and 12 months                ongoing support.
     •Video equipment: 2 x video cameras; microphone integration; sound mixer;                lights; booms; glide-cam; computer and editing programs;  iPads; and other                associated equipment.
     •Video Production: Engaging a Producer and film crew for the initial 20 x 5                 minute, 6 x 15 minute and 2 x 30 minute modules; and Editor for post                             production.
     •Studio fit out: Modifications to one of our studio areas for video production.
     •Supporting Outcome Based Material: PDF design and layout; certificate                    design and layout.



I am sure you noticed when watching our intro video on Indiegogo that our present video production and presentation needs improvement! 
The impact of this Indiegogo crowdfunding is going to dramatically improve this, after all, we don't want to distract teachers, parents and children with poor filming, sound and editing.
Engaging crew for the initial filming will allow a speedy launch of the on-line class room as well as training our team to reduce future ongoing costs. 
The purchase of in-house video and editing equipment is essential in allowing us to film on a budget. We are filming with dogs and children, both notoriously hard to hold to time restraints, I know as I have worked with both for 23 years.  
Crowdfunding will also allow us to engage experts in Infusionsoft and Customer Hub for the initial advanced set-up. This will speed up the launch of this program and deliver it in the best manner from day one.  
Ongoing support over the next twelve months with Infusionsoft, Customer Hub, the web site and social media will allow us to focus on what we are best at whilst maximising our reach.
So, crowdfunding is not only going to ensure we launch the Dog Safety for Kids on-line classroom, but also allow us to launch earlier, on a global platform, and in the best quality. 
 

     The main risk we are facing is any further delay in delegating and outsourcing tasks that are better done by experts.  
The second risk is not getting known by teachers, parents and businesses. To make a lasting impact on each region, we need to achieve a high uptake of the program into schools.
Our final risk is that kindergartens and schools face limited funding.  
To meet these challenges one of our goals is the engage parents, local business and larger corporations to sponsor this program in schools and kindergartens as part of their community involvement (and exposure).Parents can sponsor their school or kindergarten; Local business can sponsor a local area or suburb, and a corporation can introduce the program to an entire city, or more.

This means there is no financial pressure on the schools and kindergartens, and the sponsor can benefit from the exposure or philanthropy.


                                                   ** ADDITIONALLY,                                                                    OUR BONUS MEMBERSHIPS MEAN  KINDERGARTENS, SCHOOLS                                AND SPONSORS CAN HELP PAY FOR THEIR PERKS BY                                FUND-RAISING **

  
 

                             In addition to the perks we are offering there are many other ways you can help as well.
     •Are you or do you know an expert in Infusionsoft or Customer Hub (or Kajabi)? If      so, can you offer some assistance with set-up and on-going support?
     •What about web site design, optimisation and on-going support?
     •Do you have video production experience and are willing to do some production      for us here in Sydney?
     •Are you can expert at social media? This is now the best way to spread our                 message so again, set up and on-going support would be terrific.   
    Bonus Memberships may be offered for your help.
     •You can also help greatly by making some noise about Dog Safety for Kids                  on your own network (email, social media, at your school, community                            groups and so on) or in traditional media.
     •Do you own a business or, know someone who does, that would jump at the                  opportunity to sponsor a kindergarten or school?
     •Do you know a corporation that would like to improve their image and                            exposure by sponsoring a suburb or city?
     •What about local government?  
     •Lastly, please use the Indiegogo share tools to help get the crowdfunding                    campaign out to as many people as possible!

<p>MY STUDENT LIFE is a student organization formed to help
Nigerian students live better. We at MSL plan to offer various schemes to make
life cheaper, easier and also to give advice alongside educational and
lifestyle tips at the least to Nigerian students. </p>
<p><b>WHY MY STUDENT LIFE WAS FOUNDED</b></p>
<p>Nigeria is the most populous country in Africa, with 63%
of the population under the age of 24 with an annual growth rate of 3.24% and
over 30million as students.</p>
<p>MSL was founded with the sole intent of making lives of
Nigerian students better in every possible way. MSL plans to create an
educational environment, where student living in Nigeria becomes best in Africa
and also standard enough to compete in the western world, reducing the amount
of students leaving the country for educational purposes and attracting
students from all over the world boosting Nigeria’s economy gradually.</p>
<p>Nigeria also has a high rate of unemployment, which makes
employment for undergraduates almost impossible. Students with no opportunity
to earn in a country with an ever-increasing cost of living are forced to
venture into immoral and illegal activities such as prostitution, robbery,
Internet fraud and even unimaginable activities like money ritual increasing
mortality rates of Nigerian youths. This is why helping students achieve a
better and more convenient lifestyle should be an essential priority and not in
any way a luxury.  </p>

such as 10% off DOMINOS, 20% off NACK and a whooping 65% off paintballing
E.T.C. These discounts range from transportation, to shopping and eating out to
mention a few.</p>
<p><b>STUDSHOP</b></p>
<p>MSL plans to launch its discounted e-commerce platform by
May 2015, where students can purchase all products from our partner companies
at a discounted rate. Students can instantly see how much they can save on
Grocery,essential items and other products including phones and laptops.</p>
<p><b>YEARLY

<p>Over 50Million impression across social media, MSL plans
to have at least 100,000 students shopping on our discounted e-commerce

<p>If each student spends a minimum of 
N2,000/Monthly on the platform on various items such as discounted airtime,

<p>It was 2012 when part of our team reached Morocco for
the first time. We were looking for ancient mines but wat we found
was <b>Aouam</b>, its fortress and its huge mine, exploited from
pre-historic times till now. We found a forgotten place that needs to
be <b>re-discovered and promoted</b>, but no-one can do this without
involving local dweller.</p>
<p>In 2014, we came back to Aouam and started
working. We made a preliminary digging and we worked closely with
local institutions and associations, that asked us <b>to create a museum
to help promoting their land</b>: they want this museum to tell the long
story of Aouam and Tighza from pre-historic exploitation to modern
times. But there is a second aim to create this archaeo-mining
museum: the population of Aouam and Tighza, always connected to the
mine since the beginning of their history, are now suffering major
occupational crisis connected to<b> economic and social problems</b>. This
is why the new museum will be not only a new way to link people to
their homeland and history, but also <b>the engine for a true re-birth</b>. 
</p>
<p>Inside the museum, thanks to education courses and
didactic laboratories, <b>unemployed young people and kids </b>will learn
everything they need to manage and take care of the museum, starting
from French and everyday conservation of the objects, in order to<b>
work together to promote the site to the major public</b>, inside and
outside Morocco. This is why the project will be strongly linked to
<b>local school</b>, one of the first school of the area to
accept both boys and girls. They will have the opportunity to learn,
play and grow in and with the museum.</p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>
<p>The <b>AIM </b>(Associazione integrazione e multicultura, by Brigitte Pargny), together with a <b>mission of Italian CNR</b> (lead by d. Lorenza Ilia Manfredi), will create the <b>Eco-Museum for
Aouam-Tighza</b> (EMAT) to preserve local history and give a different
future to dwellers. Mining company of Tighza (<b>Compagnie Minière de Tiouissit</b>), with the
<b>Association Abghour Puor le Developpement</b>  will leave us a building to set up the
museum, ad least for the archaeological part. Laboratories and
conference room will be inside the museum, while courses will be lead
both here and in local schools.</p>
<br/>
<p>What we need is <b>furniture
and tools</b>. Our aim is to gain 5000€ to build some <b>showcases </b>for
small artefacts, to write <b>didactic panels </b>in French, Arabic, Berber,
to create<b> teaching aids</b> for the museum, such as 3D reconstructions of
archaeological objects. But most of all we need to buy a couple of
computers, a printer, paper, crayons, books to create a little
library of history and archaeology, and everything we may need during
our training courses and in laboratories for kids. All the money
gained, whether we manage to reach the entire goal or not, will be
used to buy <b>basic tools for the museum</b>.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<ul>
<li> </li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>Everything will be <b>bought by local factories</b>,
everything will be addressed to local people, in order to really help
social development and economy of this part of Morocco.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Our team made something similar in past years in
<b>	Algeria</b>. AIM and CNR worked together in the most important Algerian
	cultural institutions, to <b>train curators, tourist guides and
	restorers</b>, who started working inside the museums. You can check
	what we did at cherchel-project.isma.cnr.it<br/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But this time <b>we need everything, we need people
	all over the world</b> join together and help kids from Aouam and Tighza
	to have their own museum, help young people to have a different
	future, to help a whole community to get out the crisis, to <b>help
	Morocco</b> to have its first archaeo-mining museum.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<br/>

It was 2012 when part of our team reached Morocco for
the first time. We were looking for ancient mines but wat we found
was Aouam, its fortress and its huge mine, exploited from
pre-historic times till now. We found a forgotten place that needs to
be re-discovered and promoted, but no-one can do this without
involving local dweller.
In 2014, we came back to Aouam and started
working. We made a preliminary digging and we worked closely with
local institutions and associations, that asked us to create a museum
to help promoting their land: they want this museum to tell the long
story of Aouam and Tighza from pre-historic exploitation to modern
times. But there is a second aim to create this archaeo-mining
museum: the population of Aouam and Tighza, always connected to the
mine since the beginning of their history, are now suffering major
occupational crisis connected to economic and social problems. This
is why the new museum will be not only a new way to link people to
their homeland and history, but also the engine for a true re-birth. 

Inside the museum, thanks to education courses and
didactic laboratories, unemployed young people and kids will learn
everything they need to manage and take care of the museum, starting
from French and everyday conservation of the objects, in order to
work together to promote the site to the major public, inside and
outside Morocco. This is why the project will be strongly linked to
local school, one of the first school of the area to
accept both boys and girls. They will have the opportunity to learn,
play and grow in and with the museum.
   What We Need & What You Get 
The AIM (Associazione integrazione e multicultura, by Brigitte Pargny), together with a mission of Italian CNR (lead by d. Lorenza Ilia Manfredi), will create the Eco-Museum for
Aouam-Tighza (EMAT) to preserve local history and give a different
future to dwellers. Mining company of Tighza (Compagnie Minière de Tiouissit), with the
Association Abghour Puor le Developpement  will leave us a building to set up the
museum, ad least for the archaeological part. Laboratories and
conference room will be inside the museum, while courses will be lead
both here and in local schools.

What we need is furniture
and tools. Our aim is to gain 5000€ to build some showcases for
small artefacts, to write didactic panels in French, Arabic, Berber,
to create teaching aids for the museum, such as 3D reconstructions of
archaeological objects. But most of all we need to buy a couple of
computers, a printer, paper, crayons, books to create a little
library of history and archaeology, and everything we may need during
our training courses and in laboratories for kids. All the money
gained, whether we manage to reach the entire goal or not, will be
used to buy basic tools for the museum.


 
   The Impact 
Everything will be bought by local factories,
everything will be addressed to local people, in order to really help
social development and economy of this part of Morocco.


Our team made something similar in past years in
	Algeria. AIM and CNR worked together in the most important Algerian
	cultural institutions, to train curators, tourist guides and
	restorers, who started working inside the museums. You can check
	what we did at cherchel-project.isma.cnr.it


But this time we need everything, we need people
	all over the world join together and help kids from Aouam and Tighza
	to have their own museum, help young people to have a different
	future, to help a whole community to get out the crisis, to help
	Morocco to have its first archaeo-mining museum.




Risks & Challenges  Our biggest problem is obviously the constant lack of money: if we
	don’t manage to gain money on our own, it is not possible to
	create the museum in the building Moroccan institutions gave us. We
	have to be the starting sparkle of this project, and if we won't be
	able to go there and do all the job we asked us to do, the
	Eco-Museum for Aouam and Tighza will be only a nice dream.

We applied to various calls for funding in Italy, Morocco, Europe,
but the concurrence is big and our little community may not be strong
enough to win. This is why we ask the whole world to help us!

The woman crowned ""queen"" will promote awareness to help the less privileged and will be a great ambassador of humanity and a role model for young women around the world.The Queen of the Universe will promote education for children in need, and for children in third world countries, as well as work with various charities and nonprofits around the world.

The Mission: Queen of the Universe believes that by giving children a good education we empower them to become better human beings and make their dreams into a reality, therefore, making our next generations much stronger and more determined. We believe education is the most important thing you can give someone to better their circumstances.

Charitable Alliance: UNESCO is the United nations Education Science and Cultural Organization. Queen of the Universe highly believes in the UNESCO motto, ""Teach a child how to fish, and you'll feed him his entire life.""
All funds will go directly to UNESCO!
Now who is Victoria?I'm a Los Angeles based actress who also believes in helping those in need as well. I'm passionate about what I do and I love helping others in anyway I can. I came to become Miss Argentina because both my parents are from Argentina and I become eligible to compete in the Queen of the Universe Pageant.  For the Queen of the Universe pageant, you either have to be born in the country you represent or have blood from it. 
Why do I believe this is important?
I believe we are put on this planet to create, inspire, and help those who are not as fortunate as us. It's important to have human compassion and to try to bring love and encouragement to others in need and to help them find, get and accomplish their own dreams.  If I am crowned Queen of the Universe it would give me a larger platform to help inspire others to find their purpose as well.
USE OF FUNDSIn order to compete, I need to raise $3000 which is donated to UNESCO. THE PERKSTo thank you for your support I'm adding some pretty cool perks! You can get one of these three head shots signed by me for only 25 dollars! You may choose one.",4.0,0,"2 Campaigns

My country, Colombia, is located near the Amazon rainforest. Because the weather is mostly cloudy, astronomical observations with optical telescopes are challenging. Radio Astronomy seems to be the logical solution to improve our capability for astronomical and astrophysical research, and acquire know-how experience in the development of instrumentation. Furthermore the radio astronomy will allow us to venture in space weather research as well as solar physics research involving topics from particle's acceleration until incidence of solar phenomena in our planet. With this in mind, I designed, built, and implemented with my own budget a radio antenna for solar observation (you can see pictures below). The results have been good despite the low quality of the electronic systems.<br/><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451001999/mfjrmxqbl1lz179e1iax.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 318.079px; height: 179px;""/></p>Radio Antenna<p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1451002095/rdt2ezt08ua5cfse9mn4.png"" src="""" style=""width: 329.141px; height: 202px;""/></p>Spectrum: In the figure we can see the background electromagnetic noise in Bogotá. This has been studied and lets us know which are the available frequencies for the radio astronomical observations.<br/><br/><p>Now, I want to improve the radio spectrograph to one of higher quality. 
The goal is to build a two-element solar radio interferometer, with the 
possibility to add more antennas in the future. This instrument will be 
the First Colombian Solar Radio Interferometer (FiCoSI), covering 
frequencies in the range between 100 and 1000 MHz. The instrument will 
allow the education and training of undergraduate along with master 
degree students interested in solar radio astronomy and instrument 
development. High school students will also benefit by making their 
first steps in scientific research through data analysis and measurement
 of solar activity.<br/></p><p>Once operational, the radio interferometer will carry on daily solar 
observations, and will ahttps://<a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/the-first-colombian-solar-radio-interferometer/edit#/storylso"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/the-first-colombian...</a> be to pursue some overnight galactic and

My country, Colombia, is located near the Amazon rainforest. Because the weather is mostly cloudy, astronomical observations with optical telescopes are challenging. Radio Astronomy seems to be the logical solution to improve our capability for astronomical and astrophysical research, and acquire know-how experience in the development of instrumentation. Furthermore the radio astronomy will allow us to venture in space weather research as well as solar physics research involving topics from particle's acceleration until incidence of solar phenomena in our planet. With this in mind, I designed, built, and implemented with my own budget a radio antenna for solar observation (you can see pictures below). The results have been good despite the low quality of the electronic systems.Radio AntennaSpectrum: In the figure we can see the background electromagnetic noise in Bogotá. This has been studied and lets us know which are the available frequencies for the radio astronomical observations.Now, I want to improve the radio spectrograph to one of higher quality. 
The goal is to build a two-element solar radio interferometer, with the 
possibility to add more antennas in the future. This instrument will be 
the First Colombian Solar Radio Interferometer (FiCoSI), covering 
frequencies in the range between 100 and 1000 MHz. The instrument will 
allow the education and training of undergraduate along with master 
degree students interested in solar radio astronomy and instrument 
development. High school students will also benefit by making their 
first steps in scientific research through data analysis and measurement
 of solar activity.Once operational, the radio interferometer will carry on daily solar 
observations, and will ahttps://www.indiegogo.com/campaigns/the-first-colombian... be to pursue some overnight galactic and 
planetary observations too. All data, images, and products will be 
available for download to anyone in the internet through an online data 
archive.What do we need?The money from this campaign will be used to buy the electronic data acquisition system, two antennas, the internet domain, and the development of the educational guides and instrument software. Below, there is a detailed description.1) Hardware of data acquisition system:
ROACH 2: Is a board with the electronic components to implement the adquisiton data system. $3000.00 (https://casper.berkeley.edu/wiki/ROACH2)
Dual 2.5 GSPS ADC in circuit board with coaxial sma inputs: Is an analog digital converter able to process signal with precision until 1200 MHz. $1200.00

 Tapia’s big round eyes express all emotions—joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, etc., and she will be there, watching over you any time you need her.










As of May 2016, the development of Tapia's mold and production parts is nearly completed! This means Tapia is going into final test production. Software development is also coming along quite smoothly with plans to provide an SDK for those interested in robot development proceeding according to plan. Our focus during development has and continues to remain putting the best possible product we can on the market, and the rigor of our test procedures and development cycles reflects this. 









*MJI’s Software Development Kit (SDK) is currently still under development. Stay tuned, however, as we will be uploading details about the development of the SDK as soon as they are ready to share.




*Please accept our genuine, heart-felt thank you for choosing TAPIA! Because of your kindness and generosity, we can donate $10 of the cost of every unit you order directly to the Japan Red Cross’s 2016 Kumamoto Earthquake Disaster Relief Fund! This makes a huge impact in the lives of those affected by this disaster. We will update you again with more details once your donation has been made to this fund.

Every new product launch inevitably involves a certain amount of risk. Understanding this, we have focused ourselves on minimizing these inherent risks by building a team with years of experience in manufacturing and quality control. Here are some of the particular risks our team has identified:
1.Shipping 


As with all Indiegogo campaigns, a possibility of shipping being delayed exists. We are strategically planning and working diligently to avoid such delays, but should they arise despite our best efforts, we will let all backers know as soon as we ourselves know to ensure 100% transparency any shipping issues.




2.Function
As the product is still in development, there is a chance that some of the functionality will be changed in the final version. We are working hard around the clock to finish development as soon as we possibly can. If any changes in functionality arise as we finish development, we will notify all backers immediately and keep them updated.  

3.Strength of product
Our design philosophy is safety first. This means we not only design for safety, but we also carry out highly rigorous manufacturing tests that we perform over and over to ensure it. However, as with any product, there is a limit to what Tapia can stand, and if handled roughly or improperly, she may break.
Thank you so much for your support! We truly hope you love Tapia as much as we do!

<p><b>INTRODUCCIÓN</b></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Somos una organización (operamos con las marcas AMERICA DIGITAL y CHILE DIGITAL) dedicada a la capacitación y networking para impulsar tu desarrollo profesional. Organizamos uno de los mayores congresos de tecnología y negocios de las AMERICAS (<a href=""http://congreso.chile-digital.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://congreso.chile-digital.com/%20"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""></a><a href=""http://congreso.chile-digital.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://congreso.chile-digital.com/ </a> ) conectando e inspirando más de 5000 participantes de 22 países. El Congreso es cada dos años, el siguiente es el 21 y 22 Junio 2017. </p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Vea el vídeo de nuestro último Congreso celebrado en Santiago de Chile el  8 y  9 Julio 2015, en el centro de convenciones Espacio Riesco.</p>

<p></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Creemos que nuestra región de las
            <b>Américas </b>(Canadá, Estados Unidos y América Latina: Argentina, Brasil, Chile, Colombia, Perú, Ecuador, Panamá, Costa Rica, México) <b>tienen problemas en Educación, Salud, Transporte, Empleo,
Vivienda, Acceso al Capital, Energía , Agricultura/Alimentación, Gobierno, optimización
de recursos en las Ciudades </b>que se pueden resolver con modelos de negocio innovadores, incorporando nuevas áreas disponibles <b>(Big Data, Cloud, Smart
Cities, Mobile, Internet de las Cosas (IoT), Comercio electrónico, Marketing
Digital</b>). Pero para lograr incorporar esto de manera efectiva en modelos de negocios que funcionen a cada realidad, se requiere capacitar fuertemente a empresarios, funcionarios de gobiernos, profesionales y ejecutivos en las áreas de Gestión de la Innovación, Modelos de Negocios, Capitales de Riesgo, Metodologías Lean y de emprendimiento modernas.  Aún más, considerando que en general  profesionales no reciben educación en estas áreas en universidades o durante sus estudios formales. Por otro lado los cambios en estas áreas son extremadamente rápidos, requiriendo estar actualizado como ejecutivo, profesional o empresario continuamente.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Es así como hemos creado, como una extensión del Congreso, la <b>Plataforma Online AMERICA DIGITAL</b> <a href=""http://www.america-digital.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.america-digital.com</a> que permite que te puedas <b>conectar,
inspirar y capacitar con miles de profesionales, ejecutivos, empresarios y
funcionarios de gobierno que trabajan en estas áreas y desean realizar un
cambio</b>. Permitiendo Innovar en sus organizaciones, gobiernos locales, crear nuevas empresas y nuevos empleos.</p>

INTRODUCCIÓN
Somos una organización (operamos con las marcas AMERICA DIGITAL y CHILE DIGITAL) dedicada a la capacitación y networking para impulsar tu desarrollo profesional. Organizamos uno de los mayores congresos de tecnología y negocios de las AMERICAS (http://congreso.chile-digital.com/  ) conectando e inspirando más de 5000 participantes de 22 países. El Congreso es cada dos años, el siguiente es el 21 y 22 Junio 2017. 
Vea el vídeo de nuestro último Congreso celebrado en Santiago de Chile el  8 y  9 Julio 2015, en el centro de convenciones Espacio Riesco.
        

Creemos que nuestra región de las
            Américas (Canadá, Estados Unidos y América Latina: Argentina, Brasil, Chile, Colombia, Perú, Ecuador, Panamá, Costa Rica, México) tienen problemas en Educación, Salud, Transporte, Empleo,
Vivienda, Acceso al Capital, Energía , Agricultura/Alimentación, Gobierno, optimización
de recursos en las Ciudades que se pueden resolver con modelos de negocio innovadores, incorporando nuevas áreas disponibles (Big Data, Cloud, Smart
Cities, Mobile, Internet de las Cosas (IoT), Comercio electrónico, Marketing
Digital). Pero para lograr incorporar esto de manera efectiva en modelos de negocios que funcionen a cada realidad, se requiere capacitar fuertemente a empresarios, funcionarios de gobiernos, profesionales y ejecutivos en las áreas de Gestión de la Innovación, Modelos de Negocios, Capitales de Riesgo, Metodologías Lean y de emprendimiento modernas.  Aún más, considerando que en general  profesionales no reciben educación en estas áreas en universidades o durante sus estudios formales. Por otro lado los cambios en estas áreas son extremadamente rápidos, requiriendo estar actualizado como ejecutivo, profesional o empresario continuamente.
Es así como hemos creado, como una extensión del Congreso, la Plataforma Online AMERICA DIGITAL www.america-digital.com que permite que te puedas conectar,
inspirar y capacitar con miles de profesionales, ejecutivos, empresarios y
funcionarios de gobierno que trabajan en estas áreas y desean realizar un
cambio. Permitiendo Innovar en sus organizaciones, gobiernos locales, crear nuevas empresas y nuevos empleos.

<p>Hi . My name is Jennie Collins I would like to give a short story about
the above School. I live in Glasgow, Scotland. Originally I come from Kikuyu
Division, in Kiambu District in Kenya’s Central Province.  The schools name is Kandengwa Primary.
I taught in this school for almost twenty years before I relocated to United
Kingdom with my family.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This school was built within an Agricultural research institute in Kenya
known as KARI. It was an institute primary School built  for the  children of the staff there. It was among the best schools
in the country because it was taken care of by the institute. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Unfortunately later in mid eighties the senior staff felt they wanted to
take their children out of Kandengwa as the population had increased and the
standard was going down. The teachers were not able to cope with the large
numbers of pupils with class sizes of 50 to 60. This was too large for teachers
to be able to manage no matter how good they were.
So now Kandengwa was left as a school for the poor and the junior staff who
were even struggling to keep their children fed.  The parents could no longer keep up with the
maintenance of the school so both teachers and children were left with no help
at all and the school has deteriorated since then. </span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">
</span></p>
<p>All my 5 children went to this school and recently my son visited Kenya
and decided to go and visit his school. They use to love it and have good
memories of school and being brought up there. Sadly when he went he took
pictures of the school and sent them to me. I was so sad when I saw the
condition of the school.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We have put together a short slide show. People will observe that a lot
of the recent pictures of the school have been taken out side. This is because
the interior of the school, where the teaching takes place, is not in good
condition at all.</span></p>
<p> I feel very sorry for the
children and the teachers in that school as this is not a conducive learning
environment. Even the buildings are a hazard to those children as the walls are
cracked and there is not a single window pane. The built-in blackboards on the walls
are also cracked, same as the floors and the roofs are leaking.
I am now appealing to the all those people who would like to help
support this community through improving the education of children to help
rebuild this school. I am also appealing to the Kandengwa Old Students and
Teachers Facebook Group, to help their school as it made them to be what they
are today.</p>
<p> In order to do this I am setting up this crowd
funding appeal and will be asking former pupils, their families and anyone else
who cares enough to help us. I am in contact with the school authorities and a
committee will be formed to make arrangements to project manage the rebuilding
work. If 
successful we will try to bring an innovation which most of us take for
granted. We will get the school connected to the power grid and they will have
electricity for the very first time.</p>
<p>We have set a target of £15,000. This will be used to buy building materials to fix the roof, walls, floors and windows. As you can see from the pictures a complete rebuild is required for most of the buildings. It is intended to replace 8 classes using local builders and have these buildings connected to an electricity supply which the school has already brought close to the site.They only need to get it distributed. </p>
<p>We will take pictures and share progress with you. I have family and former pupils who are in Kenya and are forming a building committee to project manage the work. I know people will want to see that this is properly monitored. If we do not achieve our full goal we will donate any funds to the school for books or other learning materials.<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Through local contacts and family members we will ensure financial monitoring and good governance is followed.</span></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This school is almost falling down and the immediate benefit is a safer learning environment!If it falls down the pupils will have no place to learn. This school serves some of the poorest families in rural Kenya. Transportation is a problem and the next nearest school is over 5 miles away cross country. We are aware of similar projects that draw on the networks of former pupils and teachers to rally around a former school they have fond memories of. This campaign is also about community development in rural Africa and we know once it succeeds it will assist families to step out of poverty through the education of  their children.</span></p>
<p>As Kenyans we are used to working through committees to plan community projects and family events such weddings and funerals.This system of organisation is still thriving today and it is a good vehicle for this project to be delivered efficiently as opposed to leaving it in the hands of one or two individuals. The school head teacher and the school committee have been contacted and are fully supportive of this campaign however they do not have resources to commit other than their time as they are struggling to keep the school open as it is. As a former teacher I am aware of the needs of pupils in rural Kenya. You may think communication is a problem but it may surprise people to know that Kenya has one of the best telecommunications systems in the world and I am in touch with people every day.Communication is actually very easy.</p>
<p>We appreciate any financial donation you can make to help rebuild this rural school. We would also be very grateful if you would simply share this campaign with all your networks using the Indiegogo sharing tools. This would help us to spread the word. In our video clip you will see a small girl asking -if it is possible? Let's do this and make this happen. Thank you.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are a group of language teachers, language learners, IT professionals and entrepreneurs who have developed a very promising platform for language educators and their students. MyLAMPA (<strong>My</strong> <strong>L</strong>esson &amp; <strong>A</strong>ctivity <strong>M</strong>anagement, <strong>P</strong>lanning &amp; <strong>A</strong>ccess) addresses a need by appealing to smaller and medium-sized language schools and freelance teachers worldwide - it is a super-powerful lesson planner, an intuitive resource cataloging system, an invaluable management tool and a mobile learning app - it is the evolution of lesson planning and language learning management.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1494697491/yncooxa5ynpgshdltrk5.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p>
<p>We have been developing this platform for several years on our own time, with our own money and with significant personal sacrifices. We have recently decided to launch MyLAMPA as a social enterprise, but we are at the ""end of our collective financial ropes"" so we need a little help!</p>
<p>Not only will MyLAMPA transform the way teachers, language schools and learners manage learning and teaching, with your help we will have a significant positive impact on important education initiatives around the globe and we will get our users directly involved in promoting that change.</p>

If we are able to accomplish all of this by the end of the year, we will have the user base that we need in order to build a sustainable and impactful social enterprise.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If you can read this, you're not alone! According to the British Council, there will be more than 1.9 billion active English language learners by 2020.  But MyLAMPA is not restricted to English learners; it is for any student of any language attending smaller language schools or studying with private tutors.</p>
<p>We assume that every full-time language teacher will successfully invite 30 of his or her students. Based on this assumption, we will be able to donate $30.00 for each and every language teacher using the platform. Our goal in 2017 is 1,000 teachers. This would enable us to donate $1,000.00 to 30 different schools or projects that need it - just imagine the impact that will have!</p>
<p>We hope to quadruple the number of MyLAMPA users in the second year and to have a continuing and expanding positive global impact on language teaching and learning and on providing education opportunities. </p>
<p>So, aside from improving the quality of services in language schools, saving teachers' time and helping them teach better, we will make a real difference by funding important projects aimed at helping to improve education for those who need it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>One of the risks connected with the social aspect of the project is that the money we collect and donate could be mismanaged. To alleviate this risk, we will work with established charitable organizations in the beginning. We would also like you and the platform's users to help us by voting on potential donation recipients.</p>
<p>On the user side, there is always the risk that we will not be successful in launching the platform widely enough to meet our financial goals. However, we already have roughly 8,000 followers on LinkedIn (<a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/in/semullen/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.linkedin.com/in/semullen/</a>) and Facebook (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/LAMPASystems/?ref=br_rs"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://www.facebook.com/LAMPASystems/?ref=br_rs</a>) who we are contacting directly.

</div></div>","Short Summary
We are a group of language teachers, language learners, IT professionals and entrepreneurs who have developed a very promising platform for language educators and their students. MyLAMPA (My Lesson & Activity Management, Planning & Access) addresses a need by appealing to smaller and medium-sized language schools and freelance teachers worldwide - it is a super-powerful lesson planner, an intuitive resource cataloging system, an invaluable management tool and a mobile learning app - it is the evolution of lesson planning and language learning management.

We have been developing this platform for several years on our own time, with our own money and with significant personal sacrifices. We have recently decided to launch MyLAMPA as a social enterprise, but we are at the ""end of our collective financial ropes"" so we need a little help!
Not only will MyLAMPA transform the way teachers, language schools and learners manage learning and teaching, with your help we will have a significant positive impact on important education initiatives around the globe and we will get our users directly involved in promoting that change.
Your contribution will help us reach our goal and it will help you to get directly involved yourself. This is an opportunity for you to make a difference with us!

What We Need & What You Get
To guarantee success, we need to raise $40,000.00. Every single contributor who helps us reach that goal, no matter how small the gift is, will have the opportunity to vote for the recipients of our annual donations.
The money that we are raising is needed to complete development of the platform; to establish a self-perpetuating, world-wide professional network of teachers and schools; to complete development of learning apps; and to enhance the user experience. If we are able to accomplish all of this by the end of the year, we will have the user base that we need in order to build a sustainable and impactful social enterprise.
If you do decide to help us ""get out of the gate"", we would like to give you a say in how future donations will be issued. For every incremental donation of $5.00, you will have one vote when it comes time to evaluate projects and decide where to send our first donations. All contributors of $25.00 or more will also be listed on our supporters page and get a link to their website. Anyone who donates $50.00 or more will get a Certificate of Thanks to hang on their wall. Contributors of $100.00 or more will also receive free MyLAMPA student licenses at the rate of 1 per $5.00 increment. A Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum Sponsor, or WOW! status will be conferred on anyone contributing $250.00, $500.00, $750.00, $1,000.00 or $1,500.00 respectively. The larger the sponsor, the more prominently they will be displayed on the mylampa.com website.
If we do not meet our $40,000.00 goal, we will not be able to reach as many teachers, sell as many student licences or raise as much money to support schools in need. This will endanger the project. If we raise some money but fall short of our goal, we will use the funds to distribute the platform on social media and to make as many technical enhancements as possible so as to make the most of it.

The Impact
If you can read this, you're not alone! According to the British Council, there will be more than 1.9 billion active English language learners by 2020.  But MyLAMPA is not restricted to English learners; it is for any student of any language attending smaller language schools or studying with private tutors.

We hope to quadruple the number of MyLAMPA users in the second year and to have a continuing and expanding positive global impact on language teaching and learning and on providing education opportunities. 
So, aside from improving the quality of services in language schools, saving teachers' time and helping them teach better, we will make a real difference by funding important projects aimed at helping to improve education for those who need it.

</h2><p>Started in 2015, HowDoWe, Inc., is an organization dedicated to improving the value of a public education by providing public schools with the ability to spread awareness about, and raise funds for, capital projects that improve the learning environment for students. We believe that as federal, state and local governments work toward balanced budgets, communities and businesses alike should still be able to support the education of today’s students. We also understand that donors should have a choice in the types of projects they feel should be funded, and should rest assured that their money goes to the cause of their choosing.</p><ul></ul><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493862336/c6xhnw8d7l86rmpdpwzm.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Our easy to use platform, <a href=""http://www.howdowe.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>HowDoWe.org</strong></a>, allows school administrators to make an online profile, and post projects to their school profile to receive funding. Individuals, small businesses, and corporate backers can visit the website and make donations to the schools and projects of their choosing. After a donation is made, backers receive a receipt via email that can be used as a reference on their individual tax returns for potential deduction (depending on their individual tax-related circumstances). Once the project funding deadline is reached, schools receive the funds that have been collected on their profile and can begin work on the project. Backers are kept up to date on the progress of these projects to see how their m oney is being put into action.

By aligning with schools on the administrative level, we are able to coordinate on capital projects of a larger scale, ones that can have a drastic impact on the students and the community. For example, with more energy efficient facilities, budget pressures can be reduced at the state and local level, and funds can be re-allocated to other areas in need of assistance. By improving the learning environment for students, teachers are empowered, student GPA and graduation rates could rise, and crime rates could decline. And on the whole, the community could flourish with an improved education system, tax dollars could be applied more efficiently, property values could rise, and so on.</p><p>We have made amazing progress over the past year building our online platform, aligning with public schools in Chicago and attracting groups of backers to rally in support of our cause. But as we launch with our first group of schools, we are in great need of funds to make improvements to our website, and ultimately support a rapid increase in the number of backers and schools using our platform. The money collected here would allow us to expand our reach, attract new schools and donors, and allow us to keep our transaction fee as low as possible. </p><p>Half of all funds raised on IndieGoGo will be set aside for new school projects that are added to our platform. In other words, half of all funds raised here go directly to schools! By having money to help schools get started, they are attracted schools to the platform, as it gives them the much-needed jump-start to get their projects funded. It also allows us to give more options to the backers, as we want them to be able to find projects with which they can identify. The remaining funds will go toward our website, adding new functionalities to make it easier for both donors and schools to sign up and share project information. </p><p><strong>Perk: </strong>We understand that backers that support us in our efforts to improve our platform also care deeply the advancement of America's public education, and that deserves recognition.

Luckily, thus far in our interactions with schools, we have not found our processes to be in violation of any of these guidelines. It is possible that we may run into school systems that may have fundraising protocols that contradict with our funding procedures. For instance, schools must have access to a school run bank account in order for donor funds to be properly delivered. Schools must be able to access these accounts to pay for the execution of the improvement project for which the funds were raised. If funds are not accessible to schools on an individual level, it can slow down the progress of the project, or even prevent us from being able to deliver the funds. Again, in our communications with schools, though, each seem to be open to the idea of creating new pathways to make sure that funds can be received and allocated to the school projects in an efficient manner. </p><p>Our platform is also designed so that all funds collected for a specific project are delivered to the school at the end of the fundraising timeline, even if the project was not fully funded. Schools, as they follow our project preparation instructions, create backup plans for the funds if the target amount is not reached. For example, if a school is trying to refurbish a library, and they do not reach their goals, their backup plan can be to use the funds to buy new books for the library. We realize that not all projects can be broken up into smaller pieces, and funded in parts if the full goal is not reached. As an example, large machinery like HVAC units might need to be paid for with the full funding amount. To combat this challenge, we work with each school individually to create sufficient back up plans that aligns with the benefits of the original project goals.</p><p><i>Donor-related risks:</i><br/>Donors must always keep in mind that, although donations to qualified organizations like public schools and 501(c)3 nonprofits are recognized as being tax-deductible by the Internal Revenue Service, individual circumstances may apply and a qualified tax-professional should be consulted beforehand. HowDoWe oversees the delivery of funds from a donor’s credit/debit card to the bank accounts of the public schools, while only collecting a small transaction fee of 8% per donation. Donors are then presented with a receipt for the donation that may be referenced on their tax return. </p><p>As more public schools create profiles, and as more improvement projects are added to the platform, HowDoWe will have to work to continue to spread awareness and attract more donors to the website. To captivate the attention of donors at the onset, we will execute a large scale marketing campaign to attract media attention to our cause at the launch of the first posted school project. We’ve also developed a simple distribution system that makes students, their parents, and members of the local community aware of the details of the improvement projects being launched at the school, and invites them to be a part of making a positive impact on local-area students. In addition to these efforts, HowDoWe will maintain an active social media, news and blog presence to drive conversations on the issues of education reform, school funding, advancing the learning environment, and other related topics. <br/> </p><p> </p></div>","Breakdown and use of funds: Total $50,000

Started in 2015, HowDoWe, Inc., is an organization dedicated to improving the value of a public education by providing public schools with the ability to spread awareness about, and raise funds for, capital projects that improve the learning environment for students. We believe that as federal, state and local governments work toward balanced budgets, communities and businesses alike should still be able to support the education of today’s students. We also understand that donors should have a choice in the types of projects they feel should be funded, and should rest assured that their money goes to the cause of their choosing.Our easy to use platform, HowDoWe.org, allows school administrators to make an online profile, and post projects to their school profile to receive funding. Individuals, small businesses, and corporate backers can visit the website and make donations to the schools and projects of their choosing. After a donation is made, backers receive a receipt via email that can be used as a reference on their individual tax returns for potential deduction (depending on their individual tax-related circumstances). Once the project funding deadline is reached, schools receive the funds that have been collected on their profile and can begin work on the project. Backers are kept up to date on the progress of these projects to see how their m oney is being put into action. HowDoWe only charges a small transaction fee of 8% (8 cents on the dollar) per donation, which is used to cover operations and administrative expenses.Check out the schools and improvement projects on our platform here!No other fundraising platform provides this level of exclusivity for school administrators, and simplicity for donors seeking to improve and support public education projects. By aligning with schools on the administrative level, we are able to coordinate on capital projects of a larger scale, ones that can have a drastic impact on the students and the community. For example, with more energy efficient facilities, budget pressures can be reduced at the state and local level, and funds can be re-allocated to other areas in need of assistance. By improving the learning environment for students, teachers are empowered, student GPA and graduation rates could rise, and crime rates could decline. And on the whole, the community could flourish with an improved education system, tax dollars could be applied more efficiently, property values could rise, and so on.We have made amazing progress over the past year building our online platform, aligning with public schools in Chicago and attracting groups of backers to rally in support of our cause. But as we launch with our first group of schools, we are in great need of funds to make improvements to our website, and ultimately support a rapid increase in the number of backers and schools using our platform. The money collected here would allow us to expand our reach, attract new schools and donors, and allow us to keep our transaction fee as low as possible. Half of all funds raised on IndieGoGo will be set aside for new school projects that are added to our platform. In other words, half of all funds raised here go directly to schools! By having money to help schools get started, they are attracted schools to the platform, as it gives them the much-needed jump-start to get their projects funded. It also allows us to give more options to the backers, as we want them to be able to find projects with which they can identify. The remaining funds will go toward our website, adding new functionalities to make it easier for both donors and schools to sign up and share project information. Perk: We understand that backers that support us in our efforts to improve our platform also care deeply the advancement of America's public education, and that deserves recognition. So every backer that gives $75 or more will have their choice to have their names displayed in a special recognition section on our website, howdowe.org, listed as a supporter. At this stage in our business, $75 dollars can go a long way for us, and we want to make sure that the people that support HowDoWe, and public education, get the recognition they deserve.  THE FOUNDERSMichael Anderson- President & Co-FounderMichael Anderson is President and Co-Founder of HowDoWe, Inc.

He saw HowDoWe as an opportunity to continue to serve others and apply his background in entrepreneurship. RISKS & CHALLENGESProvided that our primary goals are to partner with public schools to identify improvement projects and then to attract donors to support these projects, our risks/challenges can be broken down into two categories School-related risks and Donor-related risks.School-related risks:Larger public school programs, for good reason, have more stringent processes in place that dictate how fundraisers are to be conducted. Luckily, thus far in our interactions with schools, we have not found our processes to be in violation of any of these guidelines. It is possible that we may run into school systems that may have fundraising protocols that contradict with our funding procedures. For instance, schools must have access to a school run bank account in order for donor funds to be properly delivered. Schools must be able to access these accounts to pay for the execution of the improvement project for which the funds were raised. If funds are not accessible to schools on an individual level, it can slow down the progress of the project, or even prevent us from being able to deliver the funds. Again, in our communications with schools, though, each seem to be open to the idea of creating new pathways to make sure that funds can be received and allocated to the school projects in an efficient manner. Our platform is also designed so that all funds collected for a specific project are delivered to the school at the end of the fundraising timeline, even if the project was not fully funded. Schools, as they follow our project preparation instructions, create backup plans for the funds if the target amount is not reached. For example, if a school is trying to refurbish a library, and they do not reach their goals, their backup plan can be to use the funds to buy new books for the library. We realize that not all projects can be broken up into smaller pieces, and funded in parts if the full goal is not reached. As an example, large machinery like HVAC units might need to be paid for with the full funding amount. To combat this challenge, we work with each school individually to create sufficient back up plans that aligns with the benefits of the original project goals.Donor-related risks:Donors must always keep in mind that, although donations to qualified organizations like public schools and 501(c)3 nonprofits are recognized as being tax-deductible by the Internal Revenue Service, individual circumstances may apply and a qualified tax-professional should be consulted beforehand. HowDoWe oversees the delivery of funds from a donor’s credit/debit card to the bank accounts of the public schools, while only collecting a small transaction fee of 8% per donation. Donors are then presented with a receipt for the donation that may be referenced on their tax return. As more public schools create profiles, and as more improvement projects are added to the platform, HowDoWe will have to work to continue to spread awareness and attract more donors to the website. To captivate the attention of donors at the onset, we will execute a large scale marketing campaign to attract media attention to our cause at the launch of the first posted school project. We’ve also developed a simple distribution system that makes students, their parents, and members of the local community aware of the details of the improvement projects being launched at the school, and invites them to be a part of making a positive impact on local-area students. In addition to these efforts, HowDoWe will maintain an active social media, news and blog presence to drive conversations on the issues of education reform, school funding, advancing the learning environment, and other related topics.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>There is a solution to this problem and Trade Aids is going to play a large role in making it happen.

<p>This entire mission is about the end goal.  The players to make this happen are out there.  You're one of them. Please donate if you can. However if you can't and you believe in our mission, there is another critical way to help. We need to convince industry (contractors, wholesalers, manufacturers) that trade schools classrooms are a place where people can find hope, realize dreams, and build careers.

<p>Because Trade School lab classes will have everything needed for *every* student to practice their craft, graduates will be true skilled craftspeople.

Since then the project has morphed into something that has its own momentum.So we have developed an online multi-media platform with texts and audio and galleries, regular blog posts and social media integration, and upcoming instructional videos about dealing with specific ailments, ThePullofThePath.comAt this moment it serves as a launching pad essentially focused on producing “Chi, The Sixth Sense | Vol 1” of the “The Pull of the Path / The Dao of Transformation“ in which we describe the basic concepts needed to understand how to unshackle ourselves from our learned behavior.  Who we are & what we aim forWe, at the Pull of the Path project, are dedicated to the exploration of our human existence, using our body as the ultimate tool.  What we are focused on is enhancing the process of allowing the innate intelligence within our bodies, down to the tiniest cell, to surface and flower.As a result we have been forced to look at the debilitating effects that the deep imprint of our learned behavior has on our health, well-being and longevity.To this end we explore different therapeutic approaches from around the world and the underlying principles involved; in what way they enhance or detract from allowing this natural intelligence to surface – including diverse meditation methods; psychological therapies; body techniques like Chi Gung and Tai Chi, Yoga and massage; Acupuncture; shamanism, etc.  The initiatorDr. Daniel Santos, USA, is a former Chairman of the New Mexico State Board of Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine. For over 40 years he has been immersed in the study and practice of Acupuncture, Chinese Medicine and various traditions of movement therapy. His training and life experience has given him unique qualifications to understand and communicate how to realign the body and its innate healing mechanisms with the outside world to improve one’s physical well-being and psychological health. He is also the author of 3 books translated into 7 languages. Complete bio, here.. . .. . . The GoalWe are launching a crowd-funding campaign, reaching out to friends, like-minded beings, and enthusiasts. If you are so motivated we would be like to invite you to help and support our goal and to spread this information and inspiration.Now our project is focused on the publication of the 3 volume book “The Pull of the Path / The Dao of Transformation”. We are currently raising funds to publish Volume One “Chi, The Sixth Sense”. This book is set in various exotic locations and culture backgrounds. Written in an easily understandable form it outlines the basic concepts we work with at The Pull of the Path Project. In this volume we introduce some of the main characters— each one of them presenting a different way to access body consciousness to end up with a more comprehensive and integrated view.The 3 volumes are composed like spirals, each time going deeper. In volume 2 we will go back through the underlying concepts in more depth and start to understand their applications. In this volume body practices and training are detailed. In volume 3, along with another reiteration of the basic concepts, we amplify and focus on the title of the book, “The Pull of the Path / The Dao of Transformation”: how to engage and flow with the evolutionary force that is pulling us on our specific individual path to develop health and well-being.This book is at the epicenter of our project. We will create a limited deluxe edition of ""The Pull of the Path | Vol 1 | Chi, The Sixth Sense"" printed on special paper, hand-bound (numbered & signed) as part of this crowd-sourcing campaign.​ Additionally we will produce a regular softcover print edition and an Audio CD containing the complete VOL 1 set of ""TPOTP | Chi, The Sixth Sense"", read by Dr Daniel Santos. (These products will shipped once available.) (Prototype pictures of Deluxe Edition -- handbound, special paper). . .Additionally we are now offering free regular online sketches, excerpts, audio recordings, regular blog posts & related 3rd party material:

The Pull of the Path Vol I Excerpts. Excerpts contain the key ideas of a chapter.

The Pull of the Path Vol I Sketches. Sketches try to catch the spirit & atmosphere of a chapter.

The Pull of the Path Vol I Audio recordings -- readings by Dr Daniel Santos of excerpts, sketches and some blog posts.

Blog posts provide inspiration to explore the spiral that is The Pull of the Path project.

Related 3rd party material: links to recommended websites, videos, books, interviews, etc.
In the future we will also offer instructional videos for specific ailments.

Early development is one in a lifetime opportunity. A day without learning is wasted, so get a toy and try. There is nothing to lose because kids thrive on parent's attention. If math was hard for you, it does not have to be hard for your children, but success rate is not an issue yet. If some students will not get us much as I expect, they will be much better off at school anyway.Six Projects Corp is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit looking for volunteers willing to expose themselves and their children to spatiotemporal training, and then to stereo arithmetic, which quickly leads to the numbers and facts we all learned at schools. Please contact me if you are interested in participating. Please check with MAKE THEM MAD, ROBOPEGS, SHNUMBERS and STEREOLEARNING to make up your mind.WHO I AMOnce I was officially recognized as a promising mathematician. They taught me accordingly, but I became a computer engineer. After 12 years in hardware software co-design, I started writing for computer press. For 3 years I have served as the editor-in-chief of a major computer weekly magazine. In 1999 I took a job in the US, where I suffered a harrowing and completely unexpected personal catastrophe: Two of my American children went to schools and learned to hate math. I am teaching my last child to prevent another disaster. MAKE THEM MAD and SHNUMBER ONE grew from this lessons.If you spotted something seriously wrong with my English, please excuse me and let me know. Thank you very much!",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>A novel
scientific theoretical view is needed to deeply understand a new economy “MuRatopia” and monetary
public system development.The
aim of this new forthcoming book and documentary film “The New Future
of Money” is to propose a novel approach empirically grounded on a
new scientific economic foundation analysis to unravel the way public monetary
economy works and sustainable futures for global national economies.</p>
<p>Partnering
with Professor Kaoru Yamaguchi, Ph.D [UC Berkeley] inspired me [Ssemakula Peter Luyima] to become an insatiable learner with great interest to study
a new MuRatopian economy, influenced by Professor Yamaguchi’s research work in
public money system and forward thinking future.</p>
<p>As a researcher, entrepreneur, participatory leadership community
development activist and system design thinker, my aim in collaborating with
Professor Yamaguchi is to support his pioneer works by taking an explicit “integrated scientific approach” of how we can
study the proposed new MuRatopian economy design of a public money system from
the current debt money system.</p>

<h3>
</h3>
<p>Our MuRatopia concept was influenced by the global movement for a new
economy, new social design system and curiosity driven research program.</p>
<p>Guided by the futuristic economic ideas of Professor Kaoru Yamaguchi,
innovative and creative curiosity driven research, I contacted him to introduce
the general concept of MuRatopia in my new forthcoming book: The New Future of
Money. He gladly accepted to write a Foreword for the book project.</p>
<p>Passionate about a new economic theory and global development, we have
deployed an agenda encompassing a contemporary array of subjects including but
not limited to:</p>
<p>Foundations of public money system and evolutionary economics, knowledge
and learning in social-economic life, development and innovation technologies,
transformation of industrial organizations and economic systems, experimental
structural dynamics in economics, system dynamics modeling of socio-economic
systems, evolution of the governance structures of firms and other
organizations, launching Network University of the Green World, and public
money policy proposals in the transformational process of economic life. In
short, our starting point is an “integrative economic research science” of new economy and self-management views.</p>
<p>More important, “documentary film” in addition to the book project is an essential key, i.e., as an
integrative and/or communicative pictorial link to understand and re-examine
the premise of various global economic problems based on both our collaborative
works. The conventional meaning adhering to various traditional monetary
policies may be more or less obsolete, to be replaced with more current ones
vis-à-vis contemporary academic trends.</p>
<p>These attempts are not limited to the field of economic sciences,
including business management sciences, but also include social science in
general. In that way, understanding the social profiles of complex science may
then be within our reach.</p>
<p>In the meantime, contemporary society appears to be evolving into a
newly emerging phase, chiefly characterized by an information and communication
technology (ICT) mode of production and a service work network system replacing
the earlier established factory system with a new one that is suited to actual
observations.</p>

In the face of these
changes we are urgently compelled to explore a set of new properties for a new
socio/economic system by implementing new ideas. We thus are keen to the above
mentioned throughout our collaborative works with Professor Kaoru Yamaguchi. We
are also encouraged to share new, broader spectrum for establishing a specific
method positively integrated in advancing <b>Network University of the Green
world</b>-as global mission and an educational project in strategy for <b>public
money system</b> and <b>Green Business programs</b> for a better, sustainable and
inclusive global solutions.<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440933801/pputipp3lmahkvg1gubp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p><b>A
New Scientific Economic Research Project and Alternative Approach</b></p>
<p>In my forthcoming book <i>The New Future of Money</i> and documentary film, we introduce the
MuRatopian new economic theory and creative technological development
throughout three development approaches:</p>
<p>1.<span>  </span>As a
new economy that could lead to a rethinking of the theoretical foundations of
our current economic theory. MuRatopian economics is a new movement that is
expected to develop interest among the general public and financial practionners.
This research leads to a novel approach of a new scientific economy, structural
dynamics and global public money system communities. Remarkably, we show that Creative
driven Intelligence research approach can be used for studying the scientific
national development projects of innovating innovation via creative technological
platform research systems. </p>
<p>2.<span>  </span>We
study the global economic system and its dynamics, systemic dysfunctions and
current problems in order for you to deeply understand the new proposed
economic theory as an evolutionary process in the ecosystems of concepts and
capabilities. Our goals will be to make better economic system and
technological progress and to provide scientific economic methods that support correct
theory and better decision-making in formulating many alternative plans to
address critical sociological, financial, and environmental issues.</p>
<p><b>Creativity Driven Intelligence Research Platform</b></p>
<p><b></b></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440865331/zenohbng2lsrpu2udxew.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>3.<span>  </span>Finally
we analyze how the monetary scientific economy works in order to explain the current economic crisis, and advocating for an alternative
new economy theory MuRatopian. This new theory draws on the previous findings
of Professor Karou Yamaguchi, and demonstrates for the readers how the debt
money system can destabilize and then freeze our global economy, which requires
monetary reform and public money system to function properly. </p>
<p>Combining that analysis with
MuRatopian Scientific Economy concept, Ssemakula Luyima Peter shows how a “New Economy” can be formed,
that can remove the chief cause of both booms and depressions and income
inequality!</p>

A novel
scientific theoretical view is needed to deeply understand a new economy “MuRatopia” and monetary
public system development.The
aim of this new forthcoming book and documentary film “The New Future
of Money” is to propose a novel approach empirically grounded on a
new scientific economic foundation analysis to unravel the way public monetary
economy works and sustainable futures for global national economies.
Partnering
with Professor Kaoru Yamaguchi, Ph.D [UC Berkeley] inspired me [Ssemakula Peter Luyima] to become an insatiable learner with great interest to study
a new MuRatopian economy, influenced by Professor Yamaguchi’s research work in
public money system and forward thinking future.
As a researcher, entrepreneur, participatory leadership community
development activist and system design thinker, my aim in collaborating with
Professor Yamaguchi is to support his pioneer works by taking an explicit “integrated scientific approach” of how we can
study the proposed new MuRatopian economy design of a public money system from
the current debt money system.





Professor. Kaoru Yamaguchi, Ph.D, analyzed Congressman Dennis Kucinich's
N.E.E.D. act accurately and presented his findings to US Congressional Briefing (July 26th, 2011) on the workings of the public money system. 
Joe Bongiovanni of EconomicStability.org interviews Professor Kaoru Yamaguchi at the American Monetary Reform Conference in Chicago (2010)




Listen to Congressman Dennis Kucinich explaining The Key to Economic Recovery


Part
of the reason for writing this book project and working on documentary film, I am dedicated to help advance
MuRatopian Economy as an alternative to produce better results through best scientific
economic research methodologies for  global public money system communities, business democracy (self-management) and
innovation.




Our MuRatopia concept was influenced by the global movement for a new
economy, new social design system and curiosity driven research program.
Guided by the futuristic economic ideas of Professor Kaoru Yamaguchi,
innovative and creative curiosity driven research, I contacted him to introduce
the general concept of MuRatopia in my new forthcoming book: The New Future of
Money. He gladly accepted to write a Foreword for the book project.
Passionate about a new economic theory and global development, we have
deployed an agenda encompassing a contemporary array of subjects including but
not limited to:
Foundations of public money system and evolutionary economics, knowledge
and learning in social-economic life, development and innovation technologies,
transformation of industrial organizations and economic systems, experimental
structural dynamics in economics, system dynamics modeling of socio-economic
systems, evolution of the governance structures of firms and other
organizations, launching Network University of the Green World, and public
money policy proposals in the transformational process of economic life. In
short, our starting point is an “integrative economic research science” of new economy and self-management views.
More important, “documentary film” in addition to the book project is an essential key, i.e., as an
integrative and/or communicative pictorial link to understand and re-examine
the premise of various global economic problems based on both our collaborative
works. The conventional meaning adhering to various traditional monetary
policies may be more or less obsolete, to be replaced with more current ones
vis-à-vis contemporary academic trends.
These attempts are not limited to the field of economic sciences,
including business management sciences, but also include social science in
general. In that way, understanding the social profiles of complex science may
then be within our reach.
In the meantime, contemporary society appears to be evolving into a
newly emerging phase, chiefly characterized by an information and communication
technology (ICT) mode of production and a service work network system replacing
the earlier established factory system with a new one that is suited to actual
observations.

In the face of these
changes we are urgently compelled to explore a set of new properties for a new
socio/economic system by implementing new ideas. We thus are keen to the above
mentioned throughout our collaborative works with Professor Kaoru Yamaguchi. We
are also encouraged to share new, broader spectrum for establishing a specific
method positively integrated in advancing Network University of the Green
world-as global mission and an educational project in strategy for public
money system and Green Business programs for a better, sustainable and
inclusive global solutions.




A
New Scientific Economic Research Project and Alternative Approach
In my forthcoming book The New Future of Money and documentary film, we introduce the
MuRatopian new economic theory and creative technological development
throughout three development approaches:
1.  As a
new economy that could lead to a rethinking of the theoretical foundations of
our current economic theory. MuRatopian economics is a new movement that is
expected to develop interest among the general public and financial practionners.
This research leads to a novel approach of a new scientific economy, structural
dynamics and global public money system communities. Remarkably, we show that Creative
driven Intelligence research approach can be used for studying the scientific
national development projects of innovating innovation via creative technological
platform research systems. 
2.  We
study the global economic system and its dynamics, systemic dysfunctions and
current problems in order for you to deeply understand the new proposed
economic theory as an evolutionary process in the ecosystems of concepts and
capabilities. Our goals will be to make better economic system and
technological progress and to provide scientific economic methods that support correct
theory and better decision-making in formulating many alternative plans to
address critical sociological, financial, and environmental issues.
Creativity Driven Intelligence Research Platform



3.  Finally
we analyze how the monetary scientific economy works in order to explain the current economic crisis, and advocating for an alternative
new economy theory MuRatopian. This new theory draws on the previous findings
of Professor Karou Yamaguchi, and demonstrates for the readers how the debt
money system can destabilize and then freeze our global economy, which requires
monetary reform and public money system to function properly. 
Combining that analysis with
MuRatopian Scientific Economy concept, Ssemakula Luyima Peter shows how a “New Economy” can be formed,
that can remove the chief cause of both booms and depressions and income
inequality!
