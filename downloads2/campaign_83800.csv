Music has always been there for me, even when times were tough and I felt alone. The unexpected success we had in 2015 with the release of my first full length album, <b><i>Coming Home</i></b>, has put my music on radio stations across the US and Canada, and allowed me to sign multiple sync licensing deals with major networks like Discovery, MTV, and NASCAR. It took a lot a work to get where we are now and I am so thankful to everyone who has helped to get us here. I'm proud that I was able to self fund the entire production, recording, promotion, and touring expenses related to <i>Coming Home</i>, but now I find myself without the budget to take advantage of an amazing and unexpected opportunity:</p>
<p><b>My fantastic band and I have been invited to play on 6th Street in Austin, TX during this year's SOUTH BY SOUTHWEST (SXSW) and I need your help to make it happen!</b> Thanks to RedGorilla Festival and Tinderbox Music, I'll be on 6th St. playing alongside all the biggest showcases. This is such a fantastic opportunity to get heard and seen by the music industry's biggest tastemakers and could open the door to all kinds of things that could really help us get our music out there to the masses. From booking festivals this summer, to help with distribution, marketing, and management, it's all happening in Austin this March. Of course there are no guarantees, except one: If we aren't in Austin, nothing will happen. <br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> SXSW has become such a big deal that everything from airfare to hotel room costs are jacked up during this time. Just to give you an example, the 2 star La Quinta in downtown Austin is charging $562 per room per night (as of Jan 25, 2016). Yikes! I have locked in much better rates on everything from airfare to hotel, so with relative accuracy I can tell you what we need to make this happen:<br/> <br/>Airfare for 4 - $1050<br/>2 nights, 2 hotel rooms - $450<br/>Car rental - $350<br/>Meals - $200<br/>Band - $750<br/>Cabs to/from airport - $300 <br/>--------------------------------------<br/><b>Estimated total cost: $3100</b><br/> <br/><p>In order to help reach this goal, we are offering some fun and unique perks at every pledge level that we hope will encourage everyone to get into the spirit of SXSW and help make this great opportunity a reality. Limited edition posters, CD's, and vinyl, guitar lessons, jam sessions, house/beach/rooftop/pool/wherever concerts for you and your friends, let me produce/mix your song, studio consultation, surf lessons, and more!</p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>How would you like to be able to say you helped get us to Austin where 
[insert awesome SXSW occurrence] happened that changed everything for 
us. I wouldn't be asking for help now if I didn't believe that there is 
real value in this opportunity. I hope you see that value too, and 
decide to make a contribution to help a struggling artist get his shot.<br/></p>For all our successes in 2015, the cost of getting an independent artist like me to break through the noise and clutter in a world that is completely saturated with things trying to capture our attention is significant. Your support right now is critical. Help me get my band down to Austin so I can put on a killer show for our Austin friends <i>and the music industry</i>!<br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If you start looking too closely at what could go wrong in the music business, you'll lose your mind (or leave the business.) That being said, I believe I have minimized the greatest risk - skyrocketing expenses - by securing airfare and accommodations well in advance. This action, however, was a risk unto itself. Call it a leap of faith. I know there are some good people out there who believe in me and would want to see this happen, like you. So it's a leap I felt good taking.</p>
<p>I'll be honest, I really need your help to make this happen. If we fall 
short of our goal, I will most likely make up the shortfall by selling some of my 
studio gear or a guitar or two (tear out my heart!) I hope that won't be the case, so the need for your help right away is great. <br/></p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">   Battling Giants Entertainment Presents the first annual Stoned Meadow of Doom Fest</h3>
<p>    This fundraiser is helping to kick off what will be an
annual fest featuring a variety of bands in the rock, stoner, psychedelic,
blues, doom and metal genres. The festival will take place in Omaha, Nebraska
on Friday, September 2nd, 2016. A partnership between a promotion/booking
company, Battling Giants Entertainment, and Clint Beed's YouTube channel Stoned
Meadow of Doom has been formed to bring forth the festival. The partners
anticipate attracting worldwide attention to the fest as it has the potential
to build into multi-day, outdoor festival in the United States for this genre.
Currently, there are not many options for festivals in the Midwest
to compare with the likes of Maryland Deathfest, Psycho California, Housecore
Horror Festival, etc. </p>
<p>     Unfortunately, our ambitions outweigh our wallets, and
we hope enough donations can be secured to set everything in motion. Raising
$15,000 will secure the Slowdown, a 640 capacity indoor venue with two stages
to provide quick changeover between sets, payment and lodging for the bands
involved, and advertising online and in print. Donation options that include
ticket(s) and/or merchandise are available. The highlight perk features a
lifetime pass to the festival, which will never be available again. A website
will be made to assist in travel plans as well as hotel booking. </p>
<p>    This is your opportunity to be part of
the creation of a new festival. Your donation will help bring together bands from different parts of the country for an epic evening of live music. </p>
<p>    Between fundraising and actual sales, we expect to secure a
large outdoor area for multiple days for 2017's fest. This will feature major
headliners within the genre. </p>

But, we surmount all this and stick our necks out there because making music is a total thrill and we love it.

<p>My name is Marc Gleckman. I'm 18 and I'm an independent producer from San Francisco. I currently study at Seattle University as a Freshman. </p>
<p>I've been producing music since 6th grade (7 years), and over that time I have developed a passion for music production. Through hundreds of songs, hundreds of reviews by my peers, hundreds of hours with digital audio workshops, and thousands of you tube videos, I have become independently fluent with electronic music production. </p>
<p>That was two years ago.</p>
<p>Once I could produce the music I had in my mind, everything changed. </p>
<p>I started to make my dreams come true through digital audio workshops, and I could translate my ideas to songs. This is when this idea of ""Humanity"" came into my head, the fact that I can take an idea that I processed and turn it into something produced entirely electronically amazed me. </p>
<p>I have been working on my album ""Humanity"" for the past 2 years, and it tells the instrumental story of my life over the past 2 years. </p>
<p>2 songs into its production I ran out of the projected budget I made for the album, due to the high costs of mixing, mastering, and promotions.</p>
<p>As an independent artist it is difficult to produce a professional album without the help of a mixing and mastering engineer. </p>
<p>What I am asking of you is to help me accomplish my dream, and help produce Humanity. With your funding, I can mix and master my album, promote it, and give back to supporters like you, who know a good cause when they see one.</p>
<p>To give you a sense of the costs of production, Humanity has 7 songs:</p>
<p>Mixing is $960 ($160 per track)</p>
<p>Mastering is $204 ($34 per track) </p>
<p>Master copy is $40 for the album </p>
<p>Distribution is $30 for the album</p>
<p>Promotions are set to $60 for the album.</p>
<p>This leaves me at $1,294 for the album. </p>
<p>In the mean time I am trying to do everything I can to collect the money to produce my album by January of 2016. I work as a sound board operator for the theater department of Seattle University, as well as a being a radio DJ at KSUB (soon to be KSXU FM Radio). </p>

<p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Else Ensemble?</b><br/></p>
<p>The Else Ensemble is an Israeli-German chamber music group founded a little over a year ago. We are professional musicians, members in leading world orchestras and passionate performers of chamber music. <span>We founded the ensemble after years of mutual studies and music making, where wonderful friendships and collaborations between Israeli and German musicians were born. The cultural and historical backgrounds of our musical activity were so powerful, that we decided to make it official.</span></p>
<p>We devote ourselves to the performance of music by German and Jewish composers, while constantly researching names that were <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">unjustifiably forgotten due to the events of World War II and the Holocaust. </span></p>
<p>We named our ensemble after the poetess Else Lasker-Schueler, whose life story is strongly connected both to Israel and to Germany. Inspired by her expressive art and fascinating personality, we aspire to give performance to women composers, and create thought-provoking crossovers between music and literature. </p>
<p><b>Our first concert tour in Israel</b></p>
<p>This upcoming May, the Else Ensemble comes to Israel for a concert tour: our very first appearance in a place that means everything to us. For all of us this represents a milestone in our mutual path. We will be hosting our German friends during several concerts in some of Israel's best venues. We worked very hard and prepared wonderful programs including pieces by composers such as Mozart and Brahms, as well as works by Israeli composers Noa Guy and Shulamit Ran. </p>
<p><b>As much as playing together is a personal joy for us, we deeply believe our ensemble shares an interesting story with the world: people of different cultures with a mutual complicated past, who come together for a celebration of chamber music at its highest level. </b></p>
<p>We are all professional classical musicians, who tour alone and with others all over the world. We put tremendous amount of time and efforts into rehearsing, researching repertoire and creating unforgettable programs. Naturally, bringing our music to Israel is one of our biggest dreams - this is where half of us come from. But we also deeply believe it will enrich the local classical music scene, allow Israeli musicians to connect with international musicians and help develop a cultural-musical exchange of ideas.  </p>
<p><b>Who are we and what do we play? </b></p>

<p><b>The tour is definitely happening, so why do we need your help?</b></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Because our ability to create appropriate conditions for our musicians, who worked very for this, depends on it. We are not talking about 5 star hotels or expensive restaurants. We are talking about the basic needs of a musician on tour: comfortable rehearsal rooms, flights at decent hours, healthy food, instrument insurance and many other </span>necessities<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> which can make a huge difference in the quality of our concerts. Because even though we are playing at some of Israel's best venues, what we receive is far from covering the costs. Actually, we need much more than what we ask for here, but this amount would already be a tremendous help. </span></span><br/></p>
<p><b>How will we make it happen if we do not get your help?</b></p>
<p>We will use savings and bank loans, which means our ensemble won't be able to develop much in the next seasons. Even though we perform at places such as the Berliner Philharmonie, keeping the ensemble active and alive is a financial question that goes far beyond what we earn from playing our music. We all know that music, especially classical music - needs support. </p> </div> <div> <h3>This is where the money goes to</h3>

The Else Ensemble is an Israeli-German chamber music group founded a little over a year ago. We are professional musicians, members in leading world orchestras and passionate performers of chamber music. We founded the ensemble after years of mutual studies and music making, where wonderful friendships and collaborations between Israeli and German musicians were born. The cultural and historical backgrounds of our musical activity were so powerful, that we decided to make it official.
We devote ourselves to the performance of music by German and Jewish composers, while constantly researching names that were unjustifiably forgotten due to the events of World War II and the Holocaust. 
We named our ensemble after the poetess Else Lasker-Schueler, whose life story is strongly connected both to Israel and to Germany. Inspired by her expressive art and fascinating personality, we aspire to give performance to women composers, and create thought-provoking crossovers between music and literature. 
Our first concert tour in Israel
This upcoming May, the Else Ensemble comes to Israel for a concert tour: our very first appearance in a place that means everything to us. For all of us this represents a milestone in our mutual path. We will be hosting our German friends during several concerts in some of Israel's best venues. We worked very hard and prepared wonderful programs including pieces by composers such as Mozart and Brahms, as well as works by Israeli composers Noa Guy and Shulamit Ran. 
As much as playing together is a personal joy for us, we deeply believe our ensemble shares an interesting story with the world: people of different cultures with a mutual complicated past, who come together for a celebration of chamber music at its highest level. 
We are all professional classical musicians, who tour alone and with others all over the world. We put tremendous amount of time and efforts into rehearsing, researching repertoire and creating unforgettable programs. Naturally, bringing our music to Israel is one of our biggest dreams - this is where half of us come from. But we also deeply believe it will enrich the local classical music scene, allow Israeli musicians to connect with international musicians and help develop a cultural-musical exchange of ideas.  
Who are we and what do we play?

To see all information about these concerts please click here.
22.5.16 Haifa Hecht Museum - Hecht Auditorium
23.5.16 Haifa University 
24.5.16 Herzlia Pituah - ""Zfunot Tarbut"" Foundation 
25.5.16 Herzlia Pituah - Diplomatic Event of the German Embassy
29.5.16 Jerusalem Mormon University
30.5.16 Jerusalem Etnachta 
31.5.16 Tel Aviv - Leo Beck Institute and 
1.6.16 Tel Aviv Felicija Blumental Center

The tour is definitely happening, so why do we need your help?
Because our ability to create appropriate conditions for our musicians, who worked very for this, depends on it. We are not talking about 5 star hotels or expensive restaurants. We are talking about the basic needs of a musician on tour: comfortable rehearsal rooms, flights at decent hours, healthy food, instrument insurance and many other necessities which can make a huge difference in the quality of our concerts. Because even though we are playing at some of Israel's best venues, what we receive is far from covering the costs. Actually, we need much more than what we ask for here, but this amount would already be a tremendous help. 
How will we make it happen if we do not get your help?
We will use savings and bank loans, which means our ensemble won't be able to develop much in the next seasons. Even though we perform at places such as the Berliner Philharmonie, keeping the ensemble active and alive is a financial question that goes far beyond what we earn from playing our music. We all know that music, especially classical music - needs support.    This is where the money goes to
Given that the sum we are hoping to raise here is only a part of the total budget we need, we can only estimate how we will use the money:
We are excited to be able to thank you with what we do the best - play music! Alongside concert tickets and live recordings, we invite you to join our rehearsals, meet the musicians in person and have dinner together! For businesses and fellow musicians we are happy to offer a shoutout on our website and social medias. If you're celebrating a birthday soon - let us play for you a song! Check out these and other great perks we are offering.

It will celebrate the minds and substance behind women. <br/></p>
<p>The video will be a collage of women from all walks of life acting out everyday activities, plus showcasing some of their creative aspects, with the aim of portraying their human side.

<p>Props - £100</p>
<p>  </p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The project aims to benefit society as a whole. </p>
<p>I am a 25 year old women and the pressure on me and my fellow females to look a certain way is immense. It is't just annoying, it is dangerous. People are getting ill because of it. People die because of it. </p>
<p>The pressure is everywhere and I know so many people who have been affected - and those people are not shallow. It's normal to want to look our best , and natural to want to be attractive (it's how we continue as a species!) but our insecurities are being played on by people who want to make money. It isn't ok. It's dangerous and it's subtle.</p>
<p>The project is so important to me because I have struggled in the past with pressure to be perfect, and I still do. I was completely taken in by the need to look a certain way and for a short while I was ill because of it. This is not uncommon in the slightest, and in an age where we are bombarded with images of perfection, it's so totally to be expected. It has become normal to compare ourselves to the 'best' and most selected parts of people's lives. </p>
<p>I am no longer embarrassed or ashamed of all the emotions, being so 'weak' , and surrendering to how this pressure made me feel. </p>
<p>Just writing this song helped me face the whole thing head on and I began standing up to the industry. Then, I was performing the song and saw how many people felt the same. I saw how hard the words hit women and how angry they got when they were confronted with the reality of ta situation which has become so ingrained in our society.</p>
<p>The video is for every woman who has ever felt ashamed because they dont look how the media says is right. There are still, and always will be, people who buy into the image as I did in my late teens and early twenties. I am tired of our vulnerabilities being exploited and want to start focusing my own art on what people should really be valued for. Even if one person decides to screw the systmen and feel better about themselves then I would have succeeded. </p>  </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges </h3>This project in itself has been a huge challange for me as an unsigned artist. Initially it was finding the courage to go ahead with it, but now putting the whole thing together. The support from Davide and the women has been great and I will be forever grateful, but, as it's my project I need to fund it. The extra financial support will bring it to a level needed to make it so much more effective and professional. </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>In order for project to get as much exposure as possible I would very much appreciate you sharing it wherever you can, particularly on various social media platforms!

piece of mine, titled <b><i>Ctrl+Alt+Del,</i></b> to be on their upcoming Orchestral Masters Vol. 4 CD that
will be released later this year. The recording will be taking place in the
Czech Republic performed and recorded by the Brno Philharmonic this May from the 7th to the 14th,
along with the other composers that were selected for the album. </p>
<p>ABLAZE Records is subsidizing a great deal of the recording,
which includes mixing the album (which is done by the record company's four time Grammy award
winner), manufacturing and packaging, photos, distribution, and marketing of
the album. But recording a full orchestra is expensive, and I do have
to pay a portion of the costs, as well as flying and staying in the Czech
Republic for a week to attend and supervise the recording and mixing of my
work. Now this is common that a band or artist may have to pay for a portion of
the recording. I’m not in a popular band or some rock star with a huge
recording contract where a record label can give that person or band an
advance, even though those musicians eventually may have to pay that money back
through album sales, touring, or merchandise. ABLAZE Records deals with
contemporary classical music, so the worldwide audience and sales aren’t as
high enough for the record company to give out any huge advancements to their
artists, even though they do take on a large percentage of the cost, which is
great! The kind of music that I play and write, myself and others do need
record companies like ABLAZE to record and promote this type of music. The good
news is I get to keep the rights to my work and I get royalties from any album
sales.</p>
<p>So what I am asking for is $7,500 for the rest of my
expenses that I have to pay and to get to the Czech Republic and stay for a
week. I know that’s a lot of money! But this is an amazing opportunity and one
that will get my music out there and possibly more performances of this work, in the hopes that this will push my career forward. I had
an electronic piece called <b><i>PLuCK</i></b> that ABLAZE Records released last year on there Electronic
Masters Vol. 4 album, which has been played at a few festivals and along with a few
upcoming festivals as well, and was broadcasted on a radio station in Ottawa,
Canada. So I am asking for you to help out with this project. This is such a
huge and fantastic opportunity for me! I’m extremely happy to have been chosen
out of 90 other composers from 18 different countries, and for other composers
in my field of music, an opportunity like this that doesn’t come around that
often. </p>

</p><p>Radio Enemy is a multi-genre band
based in Denver, Colorado. While Radio Enemy has only a few years under its
belt, our members have been active in the Colorado music scene for a combined
40 + years. </p>
<p>Through our collective experience, the
members of Radio Enemy have identified the need for an unbiased communal
platform for music, one that unifies the Colorado music scene in our continued
efforts to grow and thrive. While healthy competition is always good, The Radio
Enemy vision is one of cooperation; a synergistic effort to accomplish our
goals as well as the goals of all our fellow local musicians. We want to take any
of the backstabbing and trash talking out of the equation as we all have
something valuable to contribute to our community. In Addition, we personally don't
want our ""local"" radio stations (owned &amp; operated by a large
corporate conglomerate), who claim to have their fingers on the pulse, defining
what is the Colorado music scene and the culture surrounding. The way we
figure, who better to define the pulse than the <b><i>pulse </i></b>itself? And it doesn’t stop there – we want to celebrate and help
promote all aspects of Colorado culture whether it be filmmakers, artists, photographers,
comedians, apparel designers, restauranteurs, business owners, etc. That
is how the RADIO ENEMY SESSIONS idea was conceived.</p>
<p>What exactly is RADIO ENEMY SESSIONS?
RE Sessions will be a podcast supported by video content. For those who do not
know what a podcast is, the traditional podcast is a digital audio file made
available on the Internet for downloading to a computer or portable media
player, typically available as a series, new installments of which can be
received by subscribers automatically. Podcasts have the capability to reach an
endless number of people and have become one of the best outlets for
entertainment and information sourcing. RE Sessions will be an audio/visual platform
showcasing the diverse Colorado local music scene and beyond. Though the emphasis
will be on the music, our all-inclusive platform serves anything Colorado. </p>
<p>Our format will be
simple. Similar to a late night talk show, we aspire to bring in local
talent, entrepreneurs, and any Players in whatever game it is that you
play. We want to interview and give YOU the opportunity to provide a
comprehensive description of what makes you, your product, or business venture
unique. We'll sit down with you, vibe, and have some uncensored fun. Our studio
will be equipped for top-notch audio/visual transmission and as a result, every
podcast will include a jam session featuring RADIO ENEMY or whichever Colorado
artist(s) that may want to come through and throw down. All RE Sessions installments
will be available via YouTube and/or the Radio Enemy Sessions website for guests
and fellow Coloradans to view and share. </p>
<p>The good news is, we already have a
prime time spot, located right in the heart of downtown Denver and the majority
of audio and computer equipment required. The bad news is, we need some
renovations to make this all come to fruition and actually realize our
vision. We already have the meat and potatoes, what we need now is the
dressing and dessert. This is where we need you! The following is a list of the

A straight-up, no nonsense Rock n' Roll band from Southwestern Connecticut. Five guys- Dave Rizzo (Vocals), Marty Stauffer (Guitars), Keith Morey (Guitars), Roy Scaturro (Bass) and John Garvey (Drums) who are living their life's dream of playing and recording killer original rock. We've been together since late 2013, and have released three albums- ""&gt;&gt;REPEATER&gt;&gt;"", ""RADIO VOODOO: SONGS FROM THE DARK END OF THE DIAL"" and ""WAX EX-STATIC"". All of our music is available wherever you stream or buy digital music through a worldwide distribution network. Our music has garnered high praise from reviewers all over the world as well- the U.K., every country in Western Europe, China, Brazil, South Africa and of course the United States.  </p>
<p>  Since we started gigging in the summer of '14, we have played nearly 60 shows- from New London to New Rochelle, New Haven to Boston, Newburgh to Philadelphia. Although we consider NYC, Brooklyn and Queens our home turf, we have enjoyed a one-year residency at The Lumberyard in Georgetown, CT., where we bring NYC-style showcase rock shows once a month. With our high-energy shows featuring all original music from our catalogue, we have become a force in the independent rock community. We are in high demand at some of the most high-profile venues around.</p>
<p>  We recorded our first album, &gt;&gt;REPEATER&gt;&gt;, in a cold, wet New England basement on a computer that was so old it forgot to die. But the album gave us material to start playing live shows. We did it on a budget of zero. We did it ourselves. It had a very lo-fi vibe which we played up. </p>
<p>  For our second album, ""RADIO VOODOO"", we were ready to start turning pro. We had gained enough attention and traction with the first album that the time and expense was justified to really do it right. We secured an outstanding recording facility with a top-shelf engineer, then we WENT TO THE PEOPLE. OUR FANS. We ran an online crowdfunding campaign that was extremely successful, and we were able to release ""RADIO VOODOO"" in September '15. And it took off like a shot.</p>
<p>  Now we had some momentum which we capitalized on by following up with a 5 song EP, ""WAX- EX-STATIC"", less than five months after the release of ""RADIO VOODOO"". We were on a roll. And we paid for ""WAX EX-STATIC"" ourselves, using the same recording facility and engineer. We felt we owed it to our fans to give them another record straight away, without any outside contributions. And the fans are eating it up.</p>
<p>  Which brings us to today.</p>
<p>  Even as ""WAX EX-STATIC"" was in post-production, we were already writing songs for the next, as-yet untitled, full length fourth album. Even though we have negotiated very reasonable fees with the studio, we need help. FROM THE PEOPLE. OUR FANS. YOU. This album has the potential to be our breakout album. We have some influential people in the industry who are watching us; to see what we can do next. We know what we have is really, really good. Some might call it epic. And in order to deliver what will be our best album to date, we need some financial support. You can be a part of a great thing. You can say, ""I helped them when they asked for help; look at them now"".   </p>
<p>  What do we need and where will it go?</p>
<p>  Our goal is to raise a substantial amount of the funding necessary to cover post-production costs. What are those? Post-production includes the mixing engineers' fees to properly mix all the songs on the album; our engineer uses state-of-the-art software and hardware to accomplish this. Also included in post-production are the costs incurred by the Mastering engineer to make the album radio-ready. We use a Mastering engineer in Chicago who has done work for some of the biggest bands in the world. The quality of his work is second to none. Lastly, the manufacturing of CD's as well as fees for distribution across all delivery platforms such as iTunes, CDBaby, Amazon and others. </p>
<p>  Along with dedication to our craft, high-quality recordings and explosive live performances, momentum is absolutely critical to success. We have to stay on the radar constantly in order to maximize the kinetic energy we have developed. Keep playing as many live shows as possible, utilize social media extensively (we have almost 14k ""likes"" on Facebook and around 4k ""followers"" on Twitter, and are actively investigating other platforms and professional marketing strategies ), and keep the flow of great new music fast and furious. </p>
<p>  Catalina Shortwave is not a ""Hobby"" band. Not by a long shot. We love what we do with unequaled passion, and are deadly serious about doing it right and taking it as far as we can. With your help, dreams can become reality.</p>

<h3>What's Up With Frontier Jazz?</h3>
<p>My name is Jacqui Sutton, and I am the lead vocalist and bandleader for the Houston-based Frontier Jazz Orchestra. </p>
<p>I don't buy the conventional wisdom from last year's election that said: ""rural and urban America don't understand each other, therefore we are doomed!"" I don't buy it because I have been combining those parts of America in my music for the past 7 years by blending jazz and bluegrass. Not only do we enjoy performing this mashup of sound, but audiences love it.</p>
<p>Thanks to the Houston Arts Alliance, I am stretching myself as a songwriter and as a producer. Instead of covering songs written by other writers, I'm now composing my own Frontier Jazz works, and this process has been life-changing. As a producer, I'm challenged with manifesting this vision as an immersive audience experience on our largest scale to date.</p>
<p>The work I've done over the last year will culminate in the debut of ""Un-Cross Talk"" this March 16-17 at the MATCH in midtown Houston. ""Un-Cross Talk"" puts the urban and the rural together through music and audiovisual textures. Am I terrified? Yes! I've never presented original works in such a large venue before. But I am also excited because I know I am working with amazing musicians, who have trusted me these many years to keep jazz and bluegrass in conversation.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Download</h3>
<p>My biggest line item is musician fees. In order to pull off this Frontier Jazz orchestral sound, I am working with nine (9) professional jazz and classical musicians. I believe in paying musicians a <strong>fair wage </strong>for their rehearsals and performances, because as someone once said: ""Exposure can't be banked or pay the light bills"". So, here's what I still need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rehearsal and Performance Fees: $7,800</li>
<li>Live Audio and Video Recording: $2,500</li>
<li>Venue Fees (includes licensing, insurance and technical labor): $3,600</li>
<li>Ticket Subsidies for Financial Need: $1,500</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>That last item is important to me.</strong> I want to offer free tickets to community members for whom $20 admission is still a burden.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>My Values</h3>
<p>I've always been an adventurous person, and I come from a multi-cultural family. I believe that given the current climate, we should find as many ways as possible to bring people and cultures together. The argument over ""what is American"" is to me, a false one. In music, jazz and bluegrass are uniquely American art forms, though they hail from different parts of this country. I thought: ""Why should I have to choose one style? I love them both. Why can't I just combine them?"" Well, I did! </p>
<p>My hope is that in some way, listening to, and supporting the mission of Frontier Jazz will be one of many steps on the path to remembering what is truly American: Our strength together. This is the message of ""Un-Cross Talk"": Instead of talking across and past each other, let's slow down, unfold our angry arms, and hear each other.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>A New Role For Me</h3>
<p>My main concern right now is ensuring that 700 people attend this event. This is the first time I've produced something on this scale. The venue space at MATCH has 350 seats, and we will perform (and record live) across two days. To help fill those seats, I'm relying on my deep ties in the Houston community.</p>
<ul>
<li>I am working with leaders in Houston's Third Ward (which is where Frontier Jazz was created), to spread the word</li>
<li>I am partnering with local organizations such as Inprint House, where we had a combined sneak preview and literary reading to generate buzz</li>
<li>The Frontier Jazz Orchestra is encouraged by local jazz presenters to keep up its mission. To that end, Da Camera of Houston has engaged us to perform at Discovery Green in April as part of Jazz Appreciation Month</li>
</ul>
<p>The Frontier Jazz Orchestra has a track record of staging high quality performances for the Houston Community and nationally. ""Un-Cross Talk"" marks a significant step up in scale and vision, and I'm working like the dickens to ensure that 700 people know about and buy tickets to this concert.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>All Support Is Gratefully Received</h3>
<p>Many of you likely don't live in the Houston area, and won't be able to attend ""Un-Cross Talk"", or maybe you do live in the area, but are strapped financially. I get it! Word of mouth is valuable, and I would consider any shout-outs and nudges as heartfelt gifts. </p>
<p>So, if you can only support by clicking a ""share"" button through <i><strong>Indiegogo tools</strong></i>, I will thank you heartily.</p>
<p>Haven't heard my music before? My <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/jacqui-e-sutton"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">SoundCloud</a> account has lots for you to listen to. I recommend getting your feet wet with ""Summertime"".</p>

<p>~Jacqui</p>
</div></div>","What's Up With Frontier Jazz?
My name is Jacqui Sutton, and I am the lead vocalist and bandleader for the Houston-based Frontier Jazz Orchestra. 
I don't buy the conventional wisdom from last year's election that said: ""rural and urban America don't understand each other, therefore we are doomed!"" I don't buy it because I have been combining those parts of America in my music for the past 7 years by blending jazz and bluegrass. Not only do we enjoy performing this mashup of sound, but audiences love it.
Thanks to the Houston Arts Alliance, I am stretching myself as a songwriter and as a producer. Instead of covering songs written by other writers, I'm now composing my own Frontier Jazz works, and this process has been life-changing. As a producer, I'm challenged with manifesting this vision as an immersive audience experience on our largest scale to date.
The work I've done over the last year will culminate in the debut of ""Un-Cross Talk"" this March 16-17 at the MATCH in midtown Houston. ""Un-Cross Talk"" puts the urban and the rural together through music and audiovisual textures. Am I terrified? Yes! I've never presented original works in such a large venue before. But I am also excited because I know I am working with amazing musicians, who have trusted me these many years to keep jazz and bluegrass in conversation.

The Download
My biggest line item is musician fees. In order to pull off this Frontier Jazz orchestral sound, I am working with nine (9) professional jazz and classical musicians. I believe in paying musicians a fair wage for their rehearsals and performances, because as someone once said: ""Exposure can't be banked or pay the light bills"". So, here's what I still need:

Rehearsal and Performance Fees: $7,800
Live Audio and Video Recording: $2,500
Venue Fees (includes licensing, insurance and technical labor): $3,600
Ticket Subsidies for Financial Need: $1,500

That last item is important to me. I want to offer free tickets to community members for whom $20 admission is still a burden.

My Values
I've always been an adventurous person, and I come from a multi-cultural family. I believe that given the current climate, we should find as many ways as possible to bring people and cultures together. The argument over ""what is American"" is to me, a false one. In music, jazz and bluegrass are uniquely American art forms, though they hail from different parts of this country. I thought: ""Why should I have to choose one style? I love them both. Why can't I just combine them?"" Well, I did!

<p>Music has played such a huge role in shaping who I am and how I relate to the world. </p>

If you donated to Sweet Medicine's fundraising campaign and you enjoyed our album I urge you to consider donating to this campaign! The songs are going to be really magical I promise! </p>
<p>There are some <strong>amazing guest musicians</strong> on the album including<strong> <a href=""http://www.orionfreeman.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Orion Freeman</a> </strong>who contributes his mad guitar skills and is the primary recording engineer, <strong><a href=""http://toddboston.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Todd Boston</a> </strong>(composer, guitarist/multi instrumentalist and producer), <strong>Kevin Dinoto</strong> (an amazing drummer and percussionist) and more!

<h3>The Mindz EuroTrip</h3>
<p>After years of growth in serving the community we love, we're ready to ask for some help again.  Our members have grown into leaders in the city through their performance, classes, and participation in programs across the different communities of Austin and the world. Our work puts us around the next generation everyday as well as in the eye of those before us, and our music is the story teller that bridges the gap. Here's why we're leaving this time and what we need your help with.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is our second major opportunity to hit Europe with acceptance into a festival in France. In addition the organizers have lined up shows in the week before and the week after the week long festival.</li>
<li>With helping us raise this funding you'll help MDK and Flobama reach the next major step in taking our musical endeavors to a career level, and with that give us the freedom to create greater opportunities for the youth in the developmental programs we find just as much passion in.</li>
</ul>
<p>This trip is a major jump off point and already has so many people ready to see MDK and crew arrive overseas! This is the point in the process when you'll really start to see what the full potential of the Mindz could be and already is.<br/><br/>""They are the voice of the streets, the soundtrack to a revolution that will not be televised and, with an outstanding full-length debut, “Foursight,” they’re ready to blast onto a national stage."" - My Statesman</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>To give it to you straight forward and in a bit more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We're asking for $10,000 to assist with travel($3,500), merchandising/marketing($2,500), and lodging($4,000).</p></li>
<li><p> $3500 to purchase 6 plane tickets at just under $550, 4 mcs, 1 dj, and 1 photographer/social media mangager.</p></li>
<li><p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>$2,500 gets us merchandise and marketing. $500 to new pins and hats, $500 to 2 new shirt designs (+screen), $1000 to creating marketing content, $500 to printing and shipping.</span></p></li>
<li><p>$4000 is a safety cushion for at home and oversea stay while we're gone the month of September, 2 weeks of lodging is already taken care of overseas. </p></li>
<li>Yeeeooo and the perks tho. Range!  Could be a pin or a hat, a cameo in the next MDK video release, your name on the list at shows for a year, or all of that. That's all for you to decide, and if it aint there, ask about it.</li>
<li>IF we don't reach our goal, and we're still able to afford all of our plane tickets we're still going, and it's just gonna be a bit more grassroots. IF that can't happen then we'll move the money to fund our next project to record an album with the men inside of San Quentin and their children in the area, then perform it on the yard. We've had 4 performances with the men on the yard so far, still haven't cut an album, yet, so this is already in the works.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This isn't just a huge opportunity for MDK it's a big move for ATX hip hop as a whole and is a major step in showing the how a city can build a group with love and send them out to be great. </p>
<ul>
<li>With your help we'll be traveling to meet with two other local music acts, and if the tour is fully confirmed we may bring a few Cali legends with us to hype the vibe and continue into October.</li>
<li>We've started recording with two French producers as of May, from the region we'll be touring in and they've aligned several shows through their network with their fanbase ready to show up. They've also received a grant to take care of our stay there for at least 2 weeks in a single house in a central location.</li>
<li>We're reaching out to a few different companies for sponsorship like Bragi headphone (translates 8 languages in your ear, really hoping for that one), and we'd love to connect to some local clothing lines and  different retailers to form some beneficial partnerships we can both grow with to bring it back to our home city, and we welcome all serious inquiries. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The real risks are upfront in us just not trying to get there because we don't have the money right now. We know we have a lot of love for our folk, and it comes back when we ask for it. We've made it into San Quentin, and we've made it to Kenya with y'all's help. This is the leap to no looking back for a while, cause we know our people are running with us. For any unexpected challenges that may pop we've got a network of associates and mentors ready to help get us past them.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute that doesn't mean you can't help:</p>

<h2>My Story</h2>

<p>On June 2, 2017 I debuted my brand new show JERSEY GIRL, at the acclaimed NYC night club, The Metropolitan Room. JERSEY GIRL is a tribute show celebrating the musical legends who grew up in my home state of New Jersey.  My show ran through 2017 to rave reviews. I won a 2018 Bistro Award for Outstanding Vocalist and was nominated for a 2017 Broadway World Award for Best Show. After each show, audience members would ask to purchase my CD of my show, and I sadly had to tell them, I didn't have one.. YET! That's why I am here, I am ready to get into the recording studio to record this beautiful music. </p>
<p>The music we are going to record, consists of some incredible performers, singer-songwriters and even arrangers who ALL grew up in New Jersey. Frank Sinatra, Connie Francis, Bruce Springsteen, Dionne Warwick, Count Basie, Janis Ian and so many more! My ASCAP and award winning Musical Director, Rick Jensen has created some incredible arrangements. You are in for a treat!</p>

<p>Although we've put out a load of EP's and an album (as well as several albums in our last band 'The Sons') we consider this to be our debut. The Album has been recorded in 4 separate studios with a whole host of different Drummers, Bass players, Keyboard players, percussionists etc. They're all brilliant, Thanks everyone!</p>
<p><i>YOU ARE NOT PAYING FOR THE ALBUM</i>. Oh no no no!!

(Seriously, it's really really good)</p>

</div><div>
<h3>We need £20,000 (Yes it is a lot of money)</h3>
<p><i>Whaaaaaat?!?!?</i> I hear you shout, ok then, lets not mess about, here's how the money will be spent:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>PR</strong> - This is where the majority of the funds will go, in the past we've spent a few hundred pounds on mini PR campaigns and to be honest the results varied from average to underwhelming. We will work with <a href=""http://www.landerpr.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i><strong>Lander PR</strong></i></a> who will put together a custom promo campaign involving careful placement of our music and our brand in all the right places, <strong><i>radio, print press, online, TV</i></strong> etc.... We're really excited to work with Lander, their track record is phenomenal and they've worked with some truly great artists at a truly global level. Working with them we will release 2 or 3 singles and then the album will come out, the campaign will run in conjunction with....</li>
<li>
<strong>The Tour</strong> - We will be embarking on a UK tour, the scale of which we have never had the money to do before, some of the funds that you will help us raise will go towards transport, accommodation, paying our musicians and most importantly working with a reputable booking agent who can book us into the right places. Of course you can't go on tour if you have nothing to sell after the show, which brings us nicely onto....</li>
<li>
<strong>Merchandise</strong> - the remainder of the funds will be spend on the good stuff, <strong><i>namely CD's, Digital Distribution, Vinyl and T-shirts.</i></strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong><i>Videos - </i></strong>We will work with Sam Jordan films to produce at least 2 TV quality promotional videos. Sam Is flipping brilliant at what he does, here's a link to a video we did with him a few years ago with The Sons <strong><a href=""https://youtu.be/c3sE1fM7P68"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://youtu.be/c3sE1fM7P68</a></strong>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>THE RATIONALE</h3>
<p><strong><i>It really is quite simple</i></strong>, we've done a lot of great music in the past, and we've never ever had the funds to get it out to as many people as we think it deserves, so for once we're gonna do things properly, and that means money. If you believe in what you do, why would you settle for anything less than the best?</p>

We can’t wait to share our new musical ideas with you.Rather than do another DIY home record we’ve decided to take our ideas into a professional studio. Anyone who is familiar with the recording process knows that it can get pretty expensive to record and produce a full length album. This is where we could use all of the help we can get.How you can help:There is a lot of work that goes into producing a solid album; there are also a lot of costs. Some of the studio expenses include...
Studio Rental in Time Blocks
Engineer Labor
A Mixing Fee
A Mastering Fee
CD Duplication
With your help, we can cover most of these expenses.Where does the money go?We will use all of what we raise for band needs. Below is our list of priorities. Every dime will go toward covering the cost of these things in this exact order.
Studio/Album Expenses
New Merchandise
New Gear
The more donations we get, the more of these things we can afford.We plan on updating you every step of the way. You'll get to see how your contribtions help us first hand.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you are short on funds and are unable to donate we understand, but you can still help. Anyone can spread the word and help us get our campaign in front of as many eyes as possible. Between sharing the campaign online, and telling you friends in person, you can help us move one step closer to reaching our funding goal.Thank you so much for finding interest in our campaign, and helping us with any contributions you make.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>We are <strong>4 emerging Costa Rican composers</strong> based abroad who were chosen to write <u>new original works</u> for an upcoming July concert by the <strong>Orquesta Sinfónica de Heredia.</strong> Since it is rare in Costa Rica to have a concert showcasing the music of young composers, we want to take this opportunity to <strong>professionally film and record</strong> <strong>it</strong> – our goal is to <strong>encourage</strong> the current establishment of concert music in Costa Rica to entrust a new generation of composers with <strong>more opportunities</strong> to have our music performed.</p>

<h2>Event Details</h2>
<p>Mostly comprised by young musicians, the <strong><a href=""http://sinfonicadeheredia.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Orquesta Sinfónica de Heredia</a> </strong>is an orchestra that focuses on new and unexplored music from Latin America. Under the leadership of Latin Grammy winner composer and conductor<strong> <a href=""http://eddiemora.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Eddie Mora</a>,</strong> it has risen to a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gZ9Oomrsow"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">prominent role</a> in Costa Rican culture, performing works by Latin American composers and recording several albums during the last few years. For its fourth concert of the 2018 season, Eddie decided to yield the baton to a young Costa Rican conductor based in South Dakota, <strong><a href=""https://www.luisviquez.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Luis A. Viquez</a>,</strong> and let him premiere <strong>4 new works</strong> by 4 emerging composers who live outside of Costa Rica: <strong>Pablo Chin</strong> (who lives in NYC), <strong>Jose Mora Jimenez</strong> (who lives in the Netherlands), <strong>Guido Sanchez</strong> (who lives in Illinois, USA) and <strong>Andrés Soto</strong> (who lives in New Jersey, USA)</p>
<p>Two concerts are scheduled:</p>
<p><strong>July 21st</strong>, Parroquia Inmaculada Concepción, Heredia, Costa Rica. (8pm)</p>
<p><strong>July 22nd</strong>, Eugene O'Neill Theater, San José, Costa Rica. (11am)</p>
<p><strong>Carlos ""Pipo"" Chaves</strong>, a Latin Grammy-winning sound engineer, has offered to record the concert for us for a reduced fee, so we are hoping to produce a first-rate audiovisual recording that shows a new generation of Costa Rican musicians coming into their own with the help of two established figures.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>With your generous donation, you would be <strong>supporting the development of Costa Rica's next generation of composers</strong> and contributing towards having a stronger presence in the Latin American concert music scene. We plan to share this album around the world so we can inspire younger composers to continue to strive in their quest for obtaining commissions, while also hoping to <strong>encourage other institutions </strong>(both in the U.S., Europe, and Latin America) to <u>support Hispanic composers</u> by commissioning their music more often. Last year, the National Symphony of Costa Rica actually won a Latin Grammy for the first time with an album of works by Costa Rican composers from previous generations (which was, incidentally, produced by <strong>Eddie Mora</strong> and <strong>Carlos ""Pipo"" Chaves</strong>). With their help, we plan to submit this CD to try to compete in the same category next year.</p>

<h3>Resumen</h3>
<p><i><strong>Summary</strong></i></p>
<p>La Orquesta de Flautas Illawara (OFI) nace en el año 2014 al interior de la cátedra de Flauta Traversa del Prof. Wilson Padilla, en el Departamento de Música de la Facultad de Artes de la Universidad de Chile y a lo largo de este período se ha conseguido tener un espacio importante dentro de la escena musical en nuestra casa de estudios y fuera de ella, donde muchos compositores vigentes al interior del cuerpo de profesores y estudiantes de nuestra institución se han motivado a realizar trabajos junto a nosotros.</p>
<p><i>The Illawara Flute Orchestra (IFO) started in 2014 from the Professor Wilson Padilla cathedra of the Traverse Flute, in the Music Department of the Faculty of Arts of the University of Chile and during this period had managed to have an important space within the musical scene in University and outside of it, where many current composers within the body of professors and students of our institution have been motivated to perform works with ILLAWARA.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>En el devenir de estos años, la orquesta ha ido creciendo y ya somos 35 los músicos la que la conformamos quienes ejecutamos diversos tipos de flauta que van desde el flautín hasta la flauta baja en do, permitiendo un amplio registro y otorgando una sonoridad muy especial y característica a la única agrupación que tiene esta conformación en nuestro país.</p>
<p><br/><i>In the course of these years, the orchestra has been growing and we are already 35 musicians that make it up who play different types of flute ranging from the flute to the flute low in C, allowing a broad record and giving a very special sonority and characteristic to the only group that has this conformation in our country.</i></p>

</div></div>","Resumen
Summary
La Orquesta de Flautas Illawara (OFI) nace en el año 2014 al interior de la cátedra de Flauta Traversa del Prof. Wilson Padilla, en el Departamento de Música de la Facultad de Artes de la Universidad de Chile y a lo largo de este período se ha conseguido tener un espacio importante dentro de la escena musical en nuestra casa de estudios y fuera de ella, donde muchos compositores vigentes al interior del cuerpo de profesores y estudiantes de nuestra institución se han motivado a realizar trabajos junto a nosotros.
The Illawara Flute Orchestra (IFO) started in 2014 from the Professor Wilson Padilla cathedra of the Traverse Flute, in the Music Department of the Faculty of Arts of the University of Chile and during this period had managed to have an important space within the musical scene in University and outside of it, where many current composers within the body of professors and students of our institution have been motivated to perform works with ILLAWARA.
 
En el devenir de estos años, la orquesta ha ido creciendo y ya somos 35 los músicos la que la conformamos quienes ejecutamos diversos tipos de flauta que van desde el flautín hasta la flauta baja en do, permitiendo un amplio registro y otorgando una sonoridad muy especial y característica a la única agrupación que tiene esta conformación en nuestro país.
In the course of these years, the orchestra has been growing and we are already 35 musicians that make it up who play different types of flute ranging from the flute to the flute low in C, allowing a broad record and giving a very special sonority and characteristic to the only group that has this conformation in our country.
 
Como consecuencia natural de la evolución de la OFI y considerando el nivel de ejecución que tiene nuestros músicos, es que nos animamos a postular a la 46a Convención Anual de Flautas y fuimos seleccionados este año entre 500 propuestas del mundo como la agrupación que dará el Concierto de Pre-gala en Orlando, EEUU. a desarrollarse entre el 9 y 12 de agosto del presente año.

</div><div>
<p>Hi!  My name is Bernadette Hunter. I’ve been a
practicing psychotherapist for 29 years… and a singer since I can remember! In
helping people heal from emotional and psychological wounds, I’ve learned just
how powerful music can be in this process. Music is the perfect vessel for
emotion. And to my surprise, <i>music is rarely used
in therapy to help those in need.  </i> I have recorded 11 songs to help people connect with their feelings;  feelings that provide essential cues as to what we  need, to point toward our next step.  My sincere hope is that this music touches your heart.  <a href=""https://youtu.be/aGaNRxu97aI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Click here to listen to a sample!</a><br/></p>
<div>
<br/> <div> <h3 style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Impact:</h3>
<p>My album, titled “Take My Breath Away,"" is intended to
honor the spectrum of our emotions. Whether it’s the joy of holding a newborn
for the first time, the grief of losing a true love, the awe of an
indescribable sunrise, or the confusion and angst that life brings, music allows
us to embrace and hold these emotions close to our hearts.  <br/></p>
<p>I have long wanted to create <i>this</i> particular vocal collection to sooth and comfort, and to help us
celebrate our joy, courage, and resilience. <br/></p>

Hi!  My name is Bernadette Hunter. I’ve been a
practicing psychotherapist for 29 years… and a singer since I can remember! In
helping people heal from emotional and psychological wounds, I’ve learned just
how powerful music can be in this process. Music is the perfect vessel for
emotion. And to my surprise, music is rarely used
in therapy to help those in need.   I have recorded 11 songs to help people connect with their feelings;  feelings that provide essential cues as to what we  need, to point toward our next step.  My sincere hope is that this music touches your heart.  Click here to listen to a sample!

  The Impact:
My album, titled “Take My Breath Away,"" is intended to
honor the spectrum of our emotions. Whether it’s the joy of holding a newborn
for the first time, the grief of losing a true love, the awe of an
indescribable sunrise, or the confusion and angst that life brings, music allows
us to embrace and hold these emotions close to our hearts.  
I have long wanted to create this particular vocal collection to sooth and comfort, and to help us
celebrate our joy, courage, and resilience. 


The Songs:       

You Take My Breath Away
Bridge Over Troubled Water
Gone Too Soon
Over The Rainbow
Fields of Gold
How Can I Keep From Singing
Song of Bernadette
Why Walk When You Can Fly
This Little Light of Mine
True Colors
Arms of the Angel            

Early Comments:

</p><p><b><b><i>We Eat Rhythm - the story of The Prodigy Part 1</i></b><br/></b></p><p><b><b><b>A few questions answered:</b><br/></b></b></p><p><b><b>Q. Who is Martin James? (for those who don't know)</b></b></p><p>I've known the band for over 20 years and have been the band’s official campaign
biographer for the last five albums, including acclaimed studio sets <i>Always Outnumbered Never Outgunned</i>, <i>Invaders Must Die</i> and <i>The Day is My Enemy</i>. I also
provided the album essay for the compilation <i>Their Law</i>. </p>
<p><i>We Eat Rhythm</i> takes my previous book length biography of the band as a starting point and explores with greater depth
information that has come to light in the intervening years. It will include previously
unpublished interviews with Liam Howlett as well as numerous people involved
with the band.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Finally published as I’d always intended
<i>We Eat Rhythm</i>  is totally unofficial but written with full cooperation of the band and their management. It.will be the
definitive version of my biography of The Prodigy.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q. You’ve been talking about a new book for
years now. What happened?</b></p>
<p>It took me
some while to regain the rights to the book from the previous publishers. When
they sold their catalogue to a new company this rights reversion wasn’t made
clear and the new publishers thought they owned the rights to the book. After
this was sorted I signed a new book deal but the publishers stitched me up and
it took a while to get released from that contract. Which is why
I’m self publishing this now. Independent and underground – like The Prodigy</p>
<p>More recently
I suspended work on the books at the request of the band’s management. They
were deeply involved in the campaign and tours for <i>The Day is My Enemy</i> and this
book could have posed a distraction. I have always enjoyed a close working
relationship with everyone involved with the band and count many as my friends,
so I happily complied with their wishes.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q. Why publish a third version of the book?</b></p>
<p>The previous
editions of the biography were published according to the outlines presented by
publishing companies. As a result I was forced to compromise in key areas. This
version will be as I’d wanted it to be with far more contributions from The
Prodigy family, wider industry and fans. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q. You’ve divided the story into two books.
Are you just trying to double your money and take advantage of the fans?</b></p>
<p>First of all I
should make it clear that I have yet to make a single penny of profit from
either of the previous books. Once the shops had negotiated cheaper rates and
publishers had taken their cuts neither <i>Adventures with the Voodoo Crew</i> nor <i>The
Prodigy</i> recouped their costs, which meant no royalties for the author (me!).  I did receive small advances but in each case these covered
less than a month’s income – so they were largely written out of love and
respect for the band!</p>
<p>I decided to
divide the story into two books because I felt the full story couldn’t be told
otherwise. It would have become a hugely edited version of events and go
nowhere near to doing the band justice.Both books together as full versions would number 220,000 words which would be extremely expensive as one book. So this way works better for those of us who like detail.</p><p>Finally, it was agreed with the band's management that the story would be published in two parts in order to work with their own future plans. </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q. Why should we buy this book when it’s
not official?</b></p>
<p>As ever I’ve
worked closely with band and management to fit with their campaigns and to
present something they will also be proud of. It’s my perception of events and
will act as the perfect accompaniment to any autobiographies the band, or its
individual members might produce in the future. </p><p><b>Q. Will there be a regular paperback or digital edition?</b></p><p>Yes. After the second instalment of the biography (<i>We Live for Beats Prestige Edition</i>) of the biography there will be a version with both books compiled and edited. This will be called <i>We Eat Rhythm We Live for Beats </i>. This version will be the one that is sold into shops and will not include as many photos, illustrations etc.</p><p>Digital versions will be available through the Kindle store. We Eat Rhythm will be available early 2017.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p>The prestige edition <i>We Eat Rhythm </i>will come as a <i>never-to-be-repeated, individually numbered, </i>limited edition hardback
run of only 1,000. It will not be published again in this format.</p>
<p>The minimum requirement of £5,000 will
guarantee all initial backers copies of the book and will enable me to finish work on it by
covering expenses etc. This is a minimum target which means pledges will
continue to be accepted until the edition run of 1,000 is reached. After this
no more pledges will be accepted.</p>
<p>Everyone who pledges will receive the book and
an automatic <b>10% discount off <i>We Live for
Beats – The story of The Prodigy Part 2 </i></b>(to be published in 2018 - according to the band's wishes).</p>

</p><p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>

We are a Christian Rock band called We Were Once from Fayetteville, NC that consists of Courtney Sapp, Cliff Gore, and siblings Erin and Zach Burkhart . We have been together for two years now and each of us play in the worship team at our home church, Bethany Church of God. In just the short amount of time we have been together we have opened for acts such as Newsboys, Family Force 5, RED, Emery, Norma Jean, Disciple, and Decyfer Down, just to name a few.

We have some cool perks available with your donation from recording a cover for you personally to doing a house show...so GO CHECK IT OUT!! :)</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>We will be able to reach hundreds of people on the road, establish more connections and you will be able to be a part of our team and ministry by helping fund it and starting a change in the lives of our generation. </p>

This will be our first tour and we are beyond excited! Could there be bumps in the road- figuratively and literally- yes, but we have faith that with the help from people like you and God on our side...we can do this together. </p>

We are a Christian Rock band called We Were Once from Fayetteville, NC that consists of Courtney Sapp, Cliff Gore, and siblings Erin and Zach Burkhart . We have been together for two years now and each of us play in the worship team at our home church, Bethany Church of God. In just the short amount of time we have been together we have opened for acts such as Newsboys, Family Force 5, RED, Emery, Norma Jean, Disciple, and Decyfer Down, just to name a few. We have an EP and music video under our belt and now we are ready to go out and reach others with our music and message through touring- BUT WE NEED YOUR HELP!!    What We Need & What You Get We will need at least $5k to make this possible as we are NOT getting paid for shows on this tour. Your generous donations go towards equipment needed for the tour such as a trailer, sound equipment, gas, food, etc. Any amount we do not use on tour will go towards our new album to release THIS FALL! We have some cool perks available with your donation from recording a cover for you personally to doing a house show...so GO CHECK IT OUT!! :)
    The Impact We will be able to reach hundreds of people on the road, establish more connections and you will be able to be a part of our team and ministry by helping fund it and starting a change in the lives of our generation. 
    Risks & Challenges If we said there were no risks involved with this then we would be lying. A few of us are walking away from jobs either permanently or temporarily to go out on the road and do what we have always dreamed to do and share what God has laid on our hearts. This will be our first tour and we are beyond excited! Could there be bumps in the road- figuratively and literally- yes, but we have faith that with the help from people like you and God on our side...we can do this together. 
    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean they can't help:  SHARE SHARE SHARE! We can't say that enough. 


Thank you guys so much for taking your time to read this. And thank you in advance for your love & support.

Thank you for stopping in to check out my Indiegogo campaign to support the production, duplication and national promotion of my brand new, fourth CD for kids and families, ""Wonderful YOU!"" </h3> <p>My name is Vanessa Trien and I have been dedicating my career to writing, performing and teaching music since the nineties, first in New York City and then in Boston.  Coinciding with the birth of my first child, I finally took a leap in 2005 to record and release my first album of family music, entitled ""Hot Air Balloon,"" which included songs I had written over years of music teaching and writing songs with my students. I began presenting family shows with fellow musicians I had met from years of performing acoustic folk.  Audiences quickly grew, crowding in, filling rooms, toy stores and then theaters and outdoor venues to capacity.  Since then I released two more CDs - ""Carnival Day"" (coinciding with the birth of my second child while also moving into a new house during a Boston blizzard!) and ""Bubble Ride"" (no births this time!) - winning Parents' Choice Awards for all three, and developing a strong and loyal fan base in the greater Boston area and throughout the Northeast where we perform.</p>
<p>Since 2005, I have balanced being a mom to two wonderful kids along with teaching many weekly parent/child and pre-school music classes and keeping an active performing schedule with my awesome band of musicians, <b>The Jumping Monkeys</b> (Adam Rothberg, Fabio Pirozzolo, Paul Kochanski, Richard Gates).  Because of this rather wacky and sometimes crazy-making life balance, it takes me a while to sit down, write songs and turn them into an album, but with the incredible help of my dear friend and fellow Jumping Monkey, Adam Michael Rothberg, we are finally doing just that!  And, quite honestly, I'm really proud of what it has turned into!</p>
<p>This album, which I am calling <b>""Wonderful YOU,"" </b>includes 10 original acoustic folk and folk-pop-world songs aimed for young audiences, plus two covers I love (All Together Now by The Beatles, and Willie and the Hand Jive by Johnny Otis), all tied together by an overarching theme of celebrating YOU, along with your community of friends, family and neighbors coming together to play, work, live, and of course, sing and dance. I am joined on the songs by my awesome Jumping Monkeys band members. And to further the theme of celebrating community, I invited some of my favorite musician friends from my own folk and kindie music communities to join us for this album: <b>Alastair Moock, Rani Arbo, Barbara Brousal, Mister G</b> and other fantastic music friends.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Making an album as <b>a celebration of YOU</b>, the listener, and of our relationships with family, friends and community has been on my mind for a long while. Along with my own two kids, I fall in love with every student I teach and every young audience member with whom I speak. They always have fantastic ideas to share, and it’s inspiring to see their personalities already so strong and vibrant. I wanted to make an album honoring each and every one of those kids I’ve been fortunate enough to meet, along with all the kids and families listening to the album.<br/></p>But making an album is <b>EXPENSIVE</b>.  In relation to what I bring in with my teaching and performing income, it is REALLY EXPENSIVE.  REALLY REALLY EXPENSIVE. My passion is to record and perform music for kids and families so I dived in head-first to make this fourth album and am thrilled I have, but I am definitely feeling the burden of the costs, including the recording, mixing and mastering fees, paying musicians, the graphic design, photography, and duplicating of the CD, hefty award application fees, and a three-month national promotion campaign by one of the best publicists for children's music in the country.  I intended to run a crowdunding campaign for my last CD, ""Bubble Ride,"" but at the last minute I chickened out. Perhaps fear of failure. Or fear of success. Or not wanting to burden my friends, family and fans with a request such as this.  I was nearly ready to chicken out this time around too, but with the encouragement of my community, I'm going forward, confident in the incentives I can offer, confident in the product ""Wonderful YOU"" is becoming, and confident in YOU - my friends, family, fans, and the broader community of people who support quality independent music for families.  Your financial support in this campaign before the October 14 national release of ""Wonderful YOU"" will be TREMENDOUS for me, helping me cover all the biggest costs now rolling in, including the very beginning of the three-month national publicity campaign.  Whether you are able to contribute a small or large amount, or would like to contribute in other ways such as spreading the word about this campaign to friends, it all will make a giant difference for me. <b>THANK YOU, WONDERFUL YOU!</b>  I hope you'll read on  for more details on how your generous contributions would be used, and what incentives might entice you to contribute!  </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Ok, $18,000 sounds like a lot of smackeroos and does it really cost that much to put out this album?  The answers is, yes, it's a lot of smackeroos and yes, it costs that much!  I'll break it down a bit here:</p>
<p>Approximately $6,500 for recording, mixing and mastering fees, and payments to musician performing on the album</p>
<p>Over $3,000 to duplicate and ship CDs (ie. make the actual CDs you get in your hands)</p>
<p>Over $1,600 for designing the CD artwork, stickers and other design work related to the CD and promotion.</p>
<p>$1,000 for professional photography</p>
<p>About $7,000 for the national promotional campaign by one of the best publicists for kindie music in the country</p>
<p>Approximately $750 in national award application fees for the CD</p>
<p><b>So that's almost $20,000 right there</b>, which doesn't include the upcoming expected costs of mailing CDs; long overdue website, banner, baseball cap and T-shirt design, plus the making of video content, all to support the album and the furthering of my musical endeavors and dreams.  Yikes.  I'll certainly work hard to do my part to cover all I can and need to, but having your generous support will be crucial in my efforts to put these songs out in the world, make this album as successful as it can be, and set the stage for me to be able to record again in the very near future rather than working for years to pay off my debts from this project. If I don't reach my entire Indiegogo goal, I will be deeply grateful to use what I do bring in to pay off the costs of recording, mixing, mastering and duplicating the CD while I cover the additional costs.</p>
<p><b>And guess what, I've got some great PERKS for you!</b></p>
<p>There's a whole pile of fun incentives to fit any budget, including autographed CDs, ""Wonderful YOU"" baseball caps, personalized videos of songs you request, thanks on our website and social media, as well as special concerts or private parties for you and your community. I hope you'll check out our list of perks and see what fits best for you!</p>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>So, what drives me to write songs for kids, then record and perform them?  It's the glove that fits me best in this world. I LOVE what I do. I love teaching early childhood music in the classroom, I love getting on stage with my band and presenting interactive shows that kids and families can actively participate in together. I love writing songs that I think connects with the imaginations, emotions and energy of young listeners. And I'm lucky to be joined by dear musician friends in the Jumping Monkeys as well as special musical guests who lift the songs up to a level of musicianship in our recordings and shows that parents seem to appreciate and really get jazzed about.  </p>
<p>And why should you support this album while so many people seem to be putting out albums for kids these days?  Because I can confidently say that I believe this is a GREAT album with heart and integrity that you and your family will really enjoy. It's a celebration of YOU and your community. It is my personal, particular folk/pop/world take on the world of kindie music.  As this is my FOURTH album for kids and families, I have a successful track record for putting out albums that parents and kids have loved for many years.  I have also won three Parents' Choice Awards for the last three albums, so far so good!  And I feel that of all my CDs, this latest recording is the one that best reflects my current songwriting style and how we sound live as a band. And with such fantastic special musical guests, it really sounds like a musical community of family and friends having fun making music in your living room.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>This being my very first crowd funding campaign, I'm aware that I may not reach my goal of $18,000.  I will pray to the crowd funding spirits that I do, but if I don't, every dollar you donate will still be fundamental to helping me get through this project without breaking the bank and allowing me to bring this CD project to fruition and presenting it on a national stage.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you feel that you just can't contribute right now but you want to help in some way, I'd love to ask you to get the word out and make some noise about this campaign and the upcoming ""Wonderful YOU"" CD!  There are easy Indiegogo share tools you can click on to forward the campaign to friends. THANK YOU from the very bottom of my heart for all of your support!  Any way you can help is greatly appreciated!</p>
<p><b>YOU are WONDERFUL!</b></p>

I'll even play in your house and share these songs in your living room. Why ?How many sermons or great teachings can you recall? Now, think about how a song stays etched into your mind. That is why I'm doing this. I believe music has a way of changing the atmosphere and even changing perspective. I've had people who I'd least expect come up to me after a show with tears thanking me for writing these songs. It's been six years since recording a studio album and since that time I have had more life experience to add to the fodder of my songwriting and there's nothing more I want then to see this through. Let me not fail to mention that I have this amazing wife and family unit who not only believe in me but they're honest with me. Brutally. They are my main support and reason behind the confidence I have that this will be my best yet.Risks & ChallengesTruth be told, there is risk involved in this. There is the risk that I won't quite make my goal. I will communicate my every move with you IF that happens and will see to planning this through possibly with a smaller budget. However, I've never been one to give up when faced with a hurdle. This is going to happen people!Other Ways You Can HelpYou can help me tremendously by getting the word out on Facebook or word of mouth. There's a link right below where you can copy and share. I can't thank you enough for believing in me and I can't wait to get these albums in your hands!   https://igg.me/at/gospelandkidneyalbum/x/14737580",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

they also received some funding from the music foundation <i>'FMSLU'</i> to pay for the studio time and a small payment for a local producer.  They made an agreement with him that he would help with the recording and that then he would mix the album.  The recording went well and everyone was happy - the raw recordings of 14 new songs were ready.  Then they waited for the mixing to be completed. ...</p><p>A couple of months went by and still there was no mix.  Instead, the producer asked them to sign a contract giving their publishing rights to him.  The band wanted to negotiate changes to the contract, but the producer refused and then pulled out of mixing the album altogether.  This is the background to our campaign.  It's about turning disappointment into something else, something creative.</p><p>The band decided it was better to make this contract with you:</p><p><strong><i>we will use your contributions here to release Kovilje online by Spring, 2017</i>.</strong></p><p>Right now we are asking only to cover the costs of mixing the album in Mostar, which will be 1,250 Euros; and the cost of mastering it in Holland to the best quality possible, which will be around 600 Euros at a discounted price.  The remaining 100 Euros is to recover the crowdfunding fees and costs.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1478451126/v4zslhbirtdjx5exqp1u.jpg"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/><strong>Step by Step</strong></p><p>If this stage goes well and there's enough people who feel like us, then what we'd really like to do is release the album on vinyl.  That would mean a second phase of crowdfunding, but if there's enough interest we are ready to do it.  The band are worried we'd be asking too much.  So this campaign is hopefully a chance for us who love the music to send a message that we want the album and even say we'd like to have a second phase of crowdfunding to get it on vinyl too!</p><p><strong>Something for Something</strong></p><p>Crowdfunding works by asking people interested in making something happen to contribute a a little money to actually make that something happen.  In return for giving some money, the contributor receives a gift (a 'perk').  Musicians around the world are using crowdfunding more and more, because it's the best way for people who want to hear a band's music help get that music recorded and distributed.  The band gets help to pay for recording and the people who want to hear their music get to help make that possible.</p><p>If you have any questions you'd like answered, please see our <strong><a href=""http://maramostar.com/MaraFAQ_EN.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Questions &amp;

We hope you feel the same way. The BandMara and the band formed in 2010.  Mara is the singer-songwriter and plays acoustic guitar; Boske is on drums with Dario on piano and Marko on bass guitar.On Kovilje, their old friends Dino Sukalo and Sandi Kavara joined them, with Dino on lead guitar and Sandy on mandolin.   The BackgroundAt the beginning of the year, they began months of rehearsal to be ready for the time they had booked in a local recording studio; they also received some funding from the music foundation 'FMSLU' to pay for the studio time and a small payment for a local producer.  They made an agreement with him that he would help with the recording and that then he would mix the album.  The recording went well and everyone was happy - the raw recordings of 14 new songs were ready.  Then they waited for the mixing to be completed. ...A couple of months went by and still there was no mix.  Instead, the producer asked them to sign a contract giving their publishing rights to him.  The band wanted to negotiate changes to the contract, but the producer refused and then pulled out of mixing the album altogether.  This is the background to our campaign.  It's about turning disappointment into something else, something creative.The band decided it was better to make this contract with you:we will use your contributions here to release Kovilje online by Spring, 2017.Right now we are asking only to cover the costs of mixing the album in Mostar, which will be 1,250 Euros; and the cost of mastering it in Holland to the best quality possible, which will be around 600 Euros at a discounted price.  The remaining 100 Euros is to recover the crowdfunding fees and costs.Step by StepIf this stage goes well and there's enough people who feel like us, then what we'd really like to do is release the album on vinyl.  That would mean a second phase of crowdfunding, but if there's enough interest we are ready to do it.  The band are worried we'd be asking too much.  So this campaign is hopefully a chance for us who love the music to send a message that we want the album and even say we'd like to have a second phase of crowdfunding to get it on vinyl too!Something for SomethingCrowdfunding works by asking people interested in making something happen to contribute a a little money to actually make that something happen.  In return for giving some money, the contributor receives a gift (a 'perk').  Musicians around the world are using crowdfunding more and more, because it's the best way for people who want to hear a band's music help get that music recorded and distributed.  The band gets help to pay for recording and the people who want to hear their music get to help make that possible.If you have any questions you'd like answered, please see our Questions & Answers page.Rewards/PerksWe thought a lot about each 'perk', it's price and whether anyone would want it; you can see the perks on offer on the right side of the page.For those of you who would prefer to read this list in English please see below.  Kovilje no more ... no lessA digital copy of the album Kovilje with 14 songs, available for you in the Spring 2017(once the mixing and mastering is completed ).

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>The Michigan G-Men are the premier all-male a cappella group at the University of Michigan. This year, we are recording a full-length studio album through which we will strive to push the boundaries of a cappella by experimenting with avant-garde arrangements and interpretations of modern day music! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your help! The costs of recording, producing, and mastering a full-length album is a lot for a group to take on alone. We have cutting-edge music to share with you all, and we do not want money to stand between us and the impact this project will have on our listeners. In return, you have access to some awesome perks, as well as enjoying our final product when it is released on Spotify and iTunes at the end of the year! The G-Men appreciate and are eternally grateful for any and every donation we receive. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Releasing an album serves as a means of broadening the scope of our audience to share our musical vision with those who cannot attend our concerts every semester. When we produce our music, live or recorded, we always seek to present our audiences with unfamiliar sounds and effects that highlight our interpretation of emotion and meaning within each piece. This enables us to present listeners with fresh interpretations of contemporary music, and with tools that they can use beyond our shared experience to absorb new music with an open mind. Our work challenges the listener to take a step back, approach the music comprehensively,  and forget predisposition. The feelings we invoke are unique and exclusive to our group's style and sound, and we want to have the opportunity to share that with the world.</p>

<strong>The Band.</strong> </h3>
<p><strong>We are The V´s from Berlin and since 2011, we stand for wild, aggressive, straight-forward Rock and Roll""</strong></p>

</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>Why we want you on board.</strong></h3>
<p>Producing an album is not an easy task. You may do it for a few bucks but doing it properly sometimes requires collaboration of different people who have the means (studio-microphones-mixer-etc.) and the knowledge necessary to take your music a step further. That means the bands need to spend a certain amount of money to achieve the best quality possible. That’s why we ask for your support in this matter.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Album.</h3>
<p>We are not looking to make profit out of your donations, we really just want to provide you with the best version of our music possible. That’s why everybody who collaborates with 10€ or more will get at least one exclusive pre-sale digital download of the finished product.</p>
<p>Here's some of the expenses we need to cover :</p>
<ul>
<li>Recordings </li>
<li>Mixing </li>
<li>Mastering</li>
<li>Album Replication (Artwork-packaging)</li>
<li>Perks Cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>The album is comprised of 8 new songs, 1 cover song &amp; 3 bonus tracks.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Perks!</strong></h3>
<p>Besides the album, we have these exclusives <a href=""https://shop.staramba.com/musik/the-v-s.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">3D Figurines from Staramba</a> for our backers..!!!!  </p>

<h3>Some More About Us You Should Know:</h3>

<p>In 2015 we won the Hard Rock Rising contest in Berlin.</p>

<h3>The Impact.</h3>
<p>We are not supported by any record label yet, therefore we decided to include you in this journey. </p>
<p>There is a minimum goal that will allow us to achieve the main points of the whole production process. The more money we raise, the better the quality and the wider the reach of the band’s second album will be.</p>
<p>We are more than ready to jump into the studio and give our best to give YOU amazing tunes. This time, we'll release songs in Spanish.</p>

You won't regret it. <br/><br/><i><strong>IT´S THE V´S, THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW !!!</strong></i></p></div></div>","The Band. 
We are The V´s from Berlin and since 2011, we stand for wild, aggressive, straight-forward Rock and Roll""
We are experienced Live and Studio Musicians and after releasing our debut Album ""DAWN"" in 2013 and ""NARCOLEPSY GIRL Ep."" in  2016, we are ready now to record our second LP.

 
Why we want you on board.
Producing an album is not an easy task. You may do it for a few bucks but doing it properly sometimes requires collaboration of different people who have the means (studio-microphones-mixer-etc.) and the knowledge necessary to take your music a step further. That means the bands need to spend a certain amount of money to achieve the best quality possible. That’s why we ask for your support in this matter.
 
The Album.
We are not looking to make profit out of your donations, we really just want to provide you with the best version of our music possible. That’s why everybody who collaborates with 10€ or more will get at least one exclusive pre-sale digital download of the finished product.
Here's some of the expenses we need to cover :

Recordings 
Mixing 
Mastering
Album Replication (Artwork-packaging)
Perks Cost.

The album is comprised of 8 new songs, 1 cover song & 3 bonus tracks.  
 
Perks!
Besides the album, we have these exclusives 3D Figurines from Staramba for our backers..!!!!  

 
Some More About Us You Should Know:
We have a loyal fan base since 2011 and played in most of the best venues in what is currently our hometown: ""Hard Rock Cafe, Rock at Sage, Magnet Club, White Trash, Urban Spree, Wild at Heart, Frannz Club, Tiefgrund...just to mention some but the list goes on""  
In 2015 we won the Hard Rock Rising contest in Berlin.

Here's a review of that night:

 
The Berliner Radio station Star FM promoted The V's on their show ""Made In Berlin""  and has booked us as Special guest for the Night of your life event in Berlin. You'll find more reviews on the Press tab on our website.
We have self released a bunch of Music Videos:


 

 
The Impact.
We are not supported by any record label yet, therefore we decided to include you in this journey. 
There is a minimum goal that will allow us to achieve the main points of the whole production process. The more money we raise, the better the quality and the wider the reach of the band’s second album will be.
We are more than ready to jump into the studio and give our best to give YOU amazing tunes. This time, we'll release songs in Spanish.
 

Risks & Challenges
There's no risk and there's no challenge that will keep us from making this happen. We know we count on you because you can always count with us.

<p>United Sound is a non-profit organization whose mission is to provide musical performance experiences for students with special needs through peer mentorship. </p>
<p>The majority of middle, junior and high schools are not able to offer a full range of musical opportunities for students with special needs.  Yet, those currently involved in United Sound programs know that the joy of learning and performing in an ensemble can be life-changing.  We believe all children should have access to this opportunity.  It is our goal to support individual special education teachers, music educators and peer mentors in creating their own United Sound program. </p>
<p>The <a href=""http://unitedsound.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">unitedsound.org</a> team is working hard to put your donations to work by creating life-changing experiences through music for students with special needs and their peer mentors.</p>

<p><a href=""http://www.unitedsound.org/watch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://www.unitedsound.org/watch</a></p>
<p><strong>What We Need</strong></p>
<p>We need your help prior finding organizations and individuals that will help donate and help identify those who will match donations dollar-for-dollar. We have commitments from<a href=""http://https://www.givingtext.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> </a><a href=""https://www.givingtext.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">givingtext.org</a> and <a href=""http://www.edupowered.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">eduPOWERED</a> Media and amazing support from our existing donors and sponsors. With your help we hope to have all donations matched up-to our 100K goal.</p>
<p>The majority of high schools don't have band and orchestra music opportunities for students with special needs. Those involved know that the joy of learning in and performing with an ensemble can be life-changing. All children should have this opportunity. Our goal is to support individual special education teachers, music educators, and student peer mentors in creating their own United Sound programs. These after school clubs will also operate as performing ensembles through training, support, and organizational resources so that all children have access to meaningful authentic music education and musical experiences.</p>
<p>The program is run primarily by an individual school band or orchestra directors and a school special education teacher, with support from  United Sound in the form of specialized training, financial support, and organizational resources. With assistance from student volunteers (Peer Mentors), New Musicians learn to play the instrument of their choice at a personally modified level. Learning first in lesson format and ultimately transitioning to rehearsals with recorded music, the New Musicians learn a piece of music that they will then perform live in concert, once per semester, with their Peer Mentors and a full instrumental support ensemble.</p>
<p>Students who participate in United Sound programs are learning to be musicians. Making music together is a powerful force for learning, growth, friendship and understanding. Music is a language that transcends disability and the relationships formed in this way will truly resonate for all children involved.</p>
<p><strong>Why Do We Need Your Financial Support?</strong></p>
<p>We’ve built fantastic curriculum and resources that students, new musicians, and teachers love, but we need your help to bring these tools and resources to more schools. Your support will provide in-person training for teachers and allow them to add unitedsound.org music clubs to the after school schedule and afford those the opportunity to organize concerts and events around the students’ efforts.</p>
<p>Among nonprofits, United Sound is incredibly cost-effective. We have low administrative costs of &lt;5%.  To date, all of our administrative costs are already covered by existing donors.  So are the costs of creating our fantastic specialized training tutorials.</p>
<p>So, every dollar you donate will be used only on expanding access to music education and inclusion, by putting programs in schools that are currently unavailable and not taught.</p>
<p><strong>Beyond Money— We Need Your Help Spreading The Word!</strong></p>
<p>At its heart, United Sound is a grassroots movement driven by parents, teachers, musicians, and students who want students with special needs to have access and to be included through music in the schools. Whether you donate to our campaign or not, you can still help make history and build a legacy of leadership and inclusion. Anyone, anywhere can organize United Sound awareness events. We’re working on making United Sound tutorials available in multiple languages. No experience needed. Ages high school and college.</p>
<p><strong>What Is An Awareness Campaign?</strong></p>

<p>I
have spent much of my life enjoying a busy and successful music
career in Canada and abroad. In the past two decades I have released
two solo albums as well as one with the band Brothers in Stereo.
These albums have opened up my music to an international fan base and
have provided me with the opportunity to perform all over North
America in clubs, concert halls, arenas, and on national
radio/television shows. I am currently preparing to record my third
solo album in Nashville with Joshua Grange, an experienced musician/producer hailing from Hollywood, California who now calls
Nashville his home. He currently plays in Sheryl Crow's band and has
worked with the Dixie Chicks, Dwight Yoakam,  KD Lang, Ryan
Adams, and more. We have connected on a musical level that has
resulted in us co-writing many of the album's new songs. Josh has
inspired and encouraged me to explore new sounds and approaches that
allow me to venture beyond the musical horizons of my former work. We
will be working in his new Nashville studio called Resistor, which

<p>Welcome to my fundraising campaign for <i>Notations &amp; Sketches</i>, the debut album from award-winning classical pianist Alexander Soares (that's me!). I recently graduated from the doctoral course at Guildhall School of Music &amp; Drama, where I developed a passion for French 20th-Century music, particularly the composers <strong>Boulez, Dutilleux and Messiaen</strong>. I was lucky enough to perform works by these composers in some of the UK's most important venues, including The Royal Festival Hall, and several live broadcasts on BBC Radio 3. These opportunities have helped to grow my career, and firmly established my reputation as an emerging artist specialising in this repertoire.</p>
<p>I’m now at a pivotal stage of my career development, and have been offered the opportunity to record my debut album. I have secured £6000 , but<strong> I am asking for YOUR help in raising the remaining £4,500 for the album</strong>.</p>
<p>Having spent the last 8 years immersed in the study of Boulez, Dutilleux and Messiaen, I have chosen to record this repertoire for my debut album. The album will be a significant and timely addition to the discography: I have chosen to record a largely unknown work by Messiaen that was first discovered in his sketchbooks in 2013. 2016 also marks the centenary of Dutilleux’s birth. </p>
<p><strong>Your support will help me to bring this album to life in December 2016, when I begin recording, and will help me to take my next steps forward in my musical career.</strong></p>

<h2><strong>Hi :)</strong></h2>
<p>Hi! My name is AK and I’m an artist that developed from YouTube. To begin, I started making covers and remixing songs of well-known mainstream artist by rewriting the words to their lyrics and uploading it to YouTube. After only a couple videos of me doing that my channel started to progress rather quickly until eventually it became home to over 171,000 subscribers. However, many of my supporters have no clue that I’m a “<i><u>one man show</u></i>” and everything that has been accomplished thus far has been solely with my own efforts and no financial backing or in other words… (Me Backing Me) With the growth of my channel and brand, I realized that for me to truly reach my potential it can no longer be that way and I must start a fundraising campaign, which brought me here.</p>
<p>This campaign will truly help me get to the next step in my career by providing me with the support to finish my debut album, marketing and promotion, and tour support for my very first tour. So, if you back this project you’re not only helping me do all those things, but you’re also helping me make a life choice as I’ve come to this fork in the road that decides my career path. With that being said each contributor is greatly appreciated and plays a huge role in my growth rather you just help spread the word or contribute and for that I’m truly grateful.  </p>
<h2><strong>Goal</strong></h2>
<p>It is my goal to raise $30,000 which will help cover the cost of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Camera Equipment and video production</li>
<li>Album production </li>
<li>Tour Support </li>
<li>Marketing and Promotion </li>
<li>Indiegogo fees</li>
</ul>
<p>The tour now consists of six cities that are listed below. However, more cities will be added if the goal is exceeded:</p>
<ul>
<li>Atlanta, Georgia: TBA: TBA</li>
<li>Austin, Texas: March 17<sup>th</sup>, 2017-March 19<sup>th</sup>, 2017: SXSW</li>
<li>Houston, Texas: February 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2017-February 5<sup>th</sup>, 2017: TBA</li>
<li>Indio, California: April 21<sup>st</sup>, 2017-April 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2017: Coachella</li>
<li>Los Angeles, California: TBA: TBA</li>
<li>New York, New York: TBA: TBA</li>
</ul>

</div></div>","Hi :)
Hi! My name is AK and I’m an artist that developed from YouTube. To begin, I started making covers and remixing songs of well-known mainstream artist by rewriting the words to their lyrics and uploading it to YouTube. After only a couple videos of me doing that my channel started to progress rather quickly until eventually it became home to over 171,000 subscribers. However, many of my supporters have no clue that I’m a “one man show” and everything that has been accomplished thus far has been solely with my own efforts and no financial backing or in other words… (Me Backing Me) With the growth of my channel and brand, I realized that for me to truly reach my potential it can no longer be that way and I must start a fundraising campaign, which brought me here.
This campaign will truly help me get to the next step in my career by providing me with the support to finish my debut album, marketing and promotion, and tour support for my very first tour. So, if you back this project you’re not only helping me do all those things, but you’re also helping me make a life choice as I’ve come to this fork in the road that decides my career path. With that being said each contributor is greatly appreciated and plays a huge role in my growth rather you just help spread the word or contribute and for that I’m truly grateful.  
Goal
It is my goal to raise $30,000 which will help cover the cost of:

Camera Equipment and video production
Album production 
Tour Support 
Marketing and Promotion 
Indiegogo fees

The tour now consists of six cities that are listed below. However, more cities will be added if the goal is exceeded:

Atlanta, Georgia: TBA: TBA
Austin, Texas: March 17th, 2017-March 19th, 2017: SXSW
Houston, Texas: February 3rd, 2017-February 5th, 2017: TBA
Indio, California: April 21st, 2017-April 23rd, 2017: Coachella
Los Angeles, California: TBA: TBA
New York, New York: TBA: TBA

What happens if the project is not fully funded?
Well, hopefully I won’t run into this problem :-), but if this should happen I will reassess the tour cities and re-release updated tour locations based off what is raised. Also, if the the budget is exceeded I will add more tour cities (crossing my fingers). Nonetheless, the album will still be completed! Further details for the tour will be released once the campaign is over.

<h3>In short...</h3>
<p>My name is Kyler Wilson.  Most of anyone who knows me knows that I do movies. A lot of people don't know however that I have a musical side as well.  My father was a singer songwriter for everyone and their mamma on country radio in the 90s and it would seem that some of that talent fell to me.  </p>
<p>This campaign is designed to raise the money not only for recording but also mastering and distribution.  These songs are very important to me and I can't help but want to share them with the world.  With your help, I know that is possible.</p>
<p>Without your contributions this project won't be possible.  I could only ever hope to achieve a fraction of what I am aiming for without the appropriate funds to do so.  Every single dollar donated to this campaign is hugely impactful.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Here is what I need, and here is what you get...</h3>
<p>I need 7000 dollars total to go into the studio.  I need another 1500 to 2000 dollars to master and then another 1500 to 2000 to start initial distribution.  I have a few private investors that have come in on the project that is helping with a small chunk of it all. But it won't be enough to execute the project correctly without your additional contributions.  </p>
<p>That said, if the entire amount isn't achieved, don't fret. We can still do amazing things with the money we generate.  And I will continue to fund raise through other means regardless.  But if we can get enough of you excited about the project, I feel certain that the money will be pledged in no time</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>This project is so important to me.  I had left music behind a few years ago. But on my journey across the country I found my words again. And in a huge way.  I am writing better than I ever have in my life.  I feel like these songs are the type of songs that can truly touch the hearts of the listener.</p>
<p>While I have never released an album before, I do have a great reputation in following projects through completion.  And I fell skilled enough to not just complete the project but also make it great</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks</h3>
<p>It's no shocker here.  Music is one of the most easily accessible things in the world now.  You can literally write, record, and release a song in an afternoon now without ever leaving your house.  With that said, there is always the possibility that this music gets looked over like so many other artists.  But I truly believe that once my music is heard, that people will connect with it on a far more personal level than you might expect.  This music comes completely from the heart without thought of commercial-ability.  I think the music will speak for itself and in its own right be what people want to hear, once they hear it.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't help financially, its ok.  I don't expect people to take out a second mortgage on their house to help me make a record....Unless you just really really want to.  </p>
<p>But if you don't have the ability to help financially, please help by spreading the word.  Share this with your friends and family that you think might want to be part of something special.  At the end of the day, 10 dollars, however small of a contribution you might think that is, is HUGE to me.  So please share with anyone that you think might like this project. It really does make a world of difference.</p>

<p>To create, promote and record these albums takes a

a great piece of music may get short shrift. We believe crowd funding is a way

<p>There is so much that goes into a project even
before a single note is recorded. Developing this work as father and son is a
unique blessing.With your support we hope to continue this generational
collaboration. </p>
<p>Beaucoup Blue has been recording and touring for
over a decade. With this latest recording we wanted to capture both the
intimate sound of the duo as well as the fuller experience of the quartet. The
quartet includes two great friends, Jeff Sheard and Bill Zinno. Jeff Sheard (on
drums), is a well established studio / touring musician from Toronto. Bill Zinno
(upright bass), is a member of the Delaware Symphony Orchestra as well as a
local Jazz stalwart. The album is recorded by Jim Salamone, a Grammy award winning
producer &amp; owner of Cambridge Sound Studios.The work done on this project

<p>With
this crowd funding campaign, a long tradition of patronage to the arts can be

considering donating to our Indiegogo campaign. My name is Andy Owens and I am
the leader of a group of people that put together a camp at the Burning Man
festival every year in the desert of northern Nevada. Burning Man is a giant art
festival held on a large dry lakebed in the BlackRockDesert. Every year 70,000 people gather
and build a huge city out of nothing and then dismantle it and leave the
wonderful desert space in a condition better than we found it.</h3>
<p>I have been playing Bluegrass Music on a professional level for over forty
years and when I discovered Burning Man I knew that these were my
""peeps"" that this was my thing, but the music there just didn't move
me. I knew that I needed to bring my music, Bluegrass Music, live Bluegrass
Music to Burning Man.
So I did. I started a ""themecamp"" as we call it, a camp of people
dedicated to a particular theme at Burning Man.
Our theme is live Bluegrass Music and Hillbilly culture and food.</p>
<p>Over the last four years we have taken Bluegrass Music to Burning
 Man. We have mostly funded this out of my
own pocket, but we need outside this year to increase our offering. We teach
music lessons daily in our workshop tents. We teach beginners on mandolin,
banjo, guitar and fiddle and we provide the instruments to do this. We also
have nightly concerts by our professional house band, Black Rock Bluegrass, and
we need a good safe, warm place to have our concerts, so we are raising money
for a large 30x70 foot circus tent in which we plan to build our stage. </p>
<p>Indigogo likes you to list what the challenges are to this project. Anytime
you go to Burning Man and set up a camp it is a huge challenge, but this is our
fourth year out and we are going no matter what. We have two storage units out
there, we have two artcars and we have fifty camp members, we’re going, don’t
worry about that.</p>
<p>The tent we want to buy is 30x70 feet and is perfect for our camp size and
for our stage. A tent like this typically costs about $5,000 but we have found
one for $3100, we also need a trailer for it, about $1000. We have some
instruements to teach on but we need more. Instruments for beginners aren’t
fancy, about $100 each and we need about forty ten of each. These needs total
around $6,000 so that is our goal. Of course our camp budget is much more than
this, don’t think we aren’t also putting up major funds to make this happen, we
just need help in this particular area. Last year we only taught banjo and had
over twenty people every day, in fact we had to run it in shifts, we didn’t
have enough banjos!!</p>
<p>Help us bring Bluegrass Music to the dusty masses at Burning Man!!</p><p><br/></p></div>","Hello, thank you for

there, we have two artcars and we have fifty camp members, we’re going, don’t
worry about that.
The tent we want to buy is 30x70 feet and is perfect for our camp size and
for our stage. A tent like this typically costs about $5,000 but we have found
one for $3100, we also need a trailer for it, about $1000. We have some
instruements to teach on but we need more. Instruments for beginners aren’t
fancy, about $100 each and we need about forty ten of each. These needs total
around $6,000 so that is our goal. Of course our camp budget is much more than
this, don’t think we aren’t also putting up major funds to make this happen, we
just need help in this particular area. Last year we only taught banjo and had
over twenty people every day, in fact we had to run it in shifts, we didn’t
have enough banjos!!

<h3>The Way to Everest</h3>
<p>Music is a passion I didn’t ask for, it came to me at my earliest memories. Forming itself in melodies and words, then as instrumental piano pieces and finally as finished formed songs. I spent years trying to get someone else to invest in my talent/art/music. I did countless tours across the country, recorded demo after demo, making changes as labels saw fit, made videos, took photos, did press and no matter how close my brushes to fame got, the dream never got realized. Instead, I was left with nothing to show for all the time, talent, and love I put into my craft. I wasted years, time, and money on chasing “the dream” and my music suffered. That’s when I decided to take things into my own hands, self-funding and releasing my own albums. Since then, I have been slowly teaching myself the ins and outs of how to make quality music with a quality product all under a lower-middle class wage. I work extra hours, save every dime, and cut corners everywhere I can, all putting every bit back into my music.The result of this labor of love are my two self-funded and self-released full-length records “Thin Skin and an Open Heart” and “Without Heroes”, and now the almost finished third album “Everest”. It is definitely my most ambitious and most challenging. I combined 80’s synth pop with 90’s garage rock to create something completely new for Pacifico. Like the two previous albums, Everest has been a collaborative effort. I wrote lyrics with the published poet Vincent Cellucci, worked with one of my mentors, Ronnie Martin (Joy Electric) for the analog synths, enlisted the insanely talented Trey Wadsworth for the album artwork, and constantly tried to push my own boundaries by surrounding myself with musicians and artists who inspire me, like Andrew Linton on the drums, C Jason Mask on guitar, and Ben White, Pacifico's original bass player for the bass.  And for the first time, I am hiring a PR agency to help get the songs heard. With a publicity group I will hopefully be able to have more interviews, reviews, write ups, plays, and ads for the album and the tour to follow (scroll all the way down to learn more about the tour). </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Pacifico is a collective and we want you to be a part of it! All the songs are recorded, and most of the songs are mixed, but we need your help for the finishing touches. Your money will go towards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mixing</li>
<li>Mastering</li>
<li>Album Artwork</li>
<li>Promotion</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest portion of your contributions will be needed for paying the PR agents to increase the chance of getting Everest heard by many. We have tried to select ways that you can help shape this album and get something pretty awesome in return. Apart from perks including digital and physical copies of Everest, we offer exciting things such as test pressings of the vinyl, a day-pass at a climbing gym thanks to an awesome collaboration with Uptown Climbing, tickets to shows, and a special-edition song book which is only available for the duration of this campaign. Our higher priced perks are where it gets really interesting: We offer private skype and in-person concerts, we'll cover any song of your choosing, or we will even produce one of your own songs for you!  No matter how much you choose to contribute, you will also receive an immediate download of an early mix of our single, so you can get excited for the rest of Everest to follow! </p>
<p>You can see the many different perks to your right and hopefully you can find something that perfectly suits you. If you don’t see something you’d like please let us know, and we will try our best to make it happen for you. Your support really means to world to us!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that some of you aren't able to contribute to our collective album as much as you might like. Believe us, we've been there. That doesn't mean that there aren't other ways you can support us! If you want to show your love, please get the word out about this campaign. You can use the share tools of Indiegogo to link this campaign to any of your social media platforms,  you can share our video, or you can just go old-school and tell your friends about it face-to-face. </p>
<p>We're grateful to each and everyone of you and we cannot wait to show you what we've made together!!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>

I wrote lyrics with the published poet Vincent Cellucci, worked with one of my mentors, Ronnie Martin (Joy Electric) for the analog synths, enlisted the insanely talented Trey Wadsworth for the album artwork, and constantly tried to push my own boundaries by surrounding myself with musicians and artists who inspire me, like Andrew Linton on the drums, C Jason Mask on guitar, and Ben White, Pacifico's original bass player for the bass.  And for the first time, I am hiring a PR agency to help get the songs heard. With a publicity group I will hopefully be able to have more interviews, reviews, write ups, plays, and ads for the album and the tour to follow (scroll all the way down to learn more about the tour). 

What We Need & What You Get
Pacifico is a collective and we want you to be a part of it! All the songs are recorded, and most of the songs are mixed, but we need your help for the finishing touches. Your money will go towards:

Mixing
Mastering
Album Artwork
Promotion

The biggest portion of your contributions will be needed for paying the PR agents to increase the chance of getting Everest heard by many. We have tried to select ways that you can help shape this album and get something pretty awesome in return. Apart from perks including digital and physical copies of Everest, we offer exciting things such as test pressings of the vinyl, a day-pass at a climbing gym thanks to an awesome collaboration with Uptown Climbing, tickets to shows, and a special-edition song book which is only available for the duration of this campaign. Our higher priced perks are where it gets really interesting: We offer private skype and in-person concerts, we'll cover any song of your choosing, or we will even produce one of your own songs for you!  No matter how much you choose to contribute, you will also receive an immediate download of an early mix of our single, so you can get excited for the rest of Everest to follow! 
You can see the many different perks to your right and hopefully you can find something that perfectly suits you. If you don’t see something you’d like please let us know, and we will try our best to make it happen for you. Your support really means to world to us!

Other Ways You Can Help
We understand that some of you aren't able to contribute to our collective album as much as you might like. Believe us, we've been there. That doesn't mean that there aren't other ways you can support us! If you want to show your love, please get the word out about this campaign. You can use the share tools of Indiegogo to link this campaign to any of your social media platforms,  you can share our video, or you can just go old-school and tell your friends about it face-to-face. 
We're grateful to each and everyone of you and we cannot wait to show you what we've made together!!

<p><strong>About CRIMSON HIGHWAY and what we are doing.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>OUR STORY</strong></p>
<p>CRIMSON HIGHWAY is Chris Kelley (vocals), Bill Sargent (guitar), Mike Mancini (drums) &amp; Tim Walsh (bass). This is THE band that all four of us have always wanted to be in, but were never able to work it out. In 2016 Mike, Bill &amp; Tim started getting together to write some songs and it was magical. Never had any of us experienced playing in a band that everyone liked and heard the music that we were writing the same way. After we had written a handful of songs, it was obvious that we needed a singer/lyricist. As we sat down and wrote a long list of qualifications that we were looking for, it seemed like a nearly impossible task to find the perfect guy, but then Tim thought about his lifelong friend and he knew immediately that Chris filled every one of the items on our list, but there was one problem. Chris had decided a few years before to stop performing and just focus on writing songs and he was happy doing so.</p>
<p>Tim decided to give Chris a call anyway and convinced him to come out and check the songs out and although Chris was 100% sure that he had no interest and would not be joining us, he came out anyway as a favor to Tim. When he arrived, he was blown away by both the song writing and the chemistry. Once again, the magic was in the room and at an even higher level. It immediately felt like putting on your favorite pair of worn out jeans. It felt like family and home and we knew we had to share this music that we are so proud of with you and when we performed it live you gave us an overwhelmingly positive response. That brings us here, to 2017, we are CRIMSON HIGHWAY.</p>
<p>As is the case with all things in life: if something is worth doing, it's worth doing right! So, we spent a lot of time determining the best way to make our album. We knew that it was important to keep the magic and chemistry going in every element of this band so we knew that we had to have Ashley Peacock produce the album at Soul Foundry Studios, in Flint Michigan.</p>
<p><strong>WHY FLINT, MI IS IMPORTANT TO US</strong></p>
<p>It is extremely important to us to record in downtown Flint, as it is the city that we all call home. You see, Flint has a unique and beautiful heritage and even though it would seem to outsiders that only see the headlines that Flint is a tragic place to be due to everything from the closing of factories and the loss of jobs to the more recent Flint Water Crisis.</p>
<p>We know that Flint is also a beautiful place, with a heritage that spans many amazing historic accomplishments like being the birthplace of General Motors, the display of unity in the SIT-DOWN STRIKE, producing tanks for our armed forces during WWII. We also have the musical heritage of being the birthplace of one of the biggest Rock n Roll bands of their era, GRAND FUNK RAILROAD.</p>
<p>Decades later, the media paints a bleak picture of Flint, but what we have is the most resilient city in America. We are overcoming factory closures and job loss. Despite the current water crisis, Flint is still fighting as it is home to one of America's elite engineering schools, Kettering University. It is also home to a large University of Michigan campus along with Michigan State University, Baker College and Mott Community College. Flint is a city where art is starting to take a foothold and the city is once again beginning to embrace its artists.</p>
<p>So as Flint fights the odds and is discovering what it takes to have its revival, CRIMSON HIGHWAY is proud of our home and is committed to standing and fighting with our city.</p>

<p>NB NEDERLANDERS - SCROLL NAAR ""WHAT I NEED AND WHAT YOU GET"" VOOR BETALING MET OVERSCHRIJVING OF PAYPALL</p>
<p>Since i was young i was already making music and singing. So music has always played a major part in my life. But i couldn’t imagined i would become a solo singer later in life. Before my solocareer i was musical leader and bandleader in our church; and pianist and flute player and vocalist on multiple events. I sang in bands,  and worked as backing vocalist. I did multiple projects for studio’s and artists and later i  also followed the education of master teacher in Estill voice training to complete my vocal education and be able to teach others to help them develop their voice and singing and express their emotion in music. Cause music is emotion, and it’s like a first language for me where i can express myself, be myself, get to rest or get exited when i need that. It refreshes my soul, and inspires me. Music helped me get through my toughest moments.</p>
<p>Most of you know that i’ve been very ill multiple times, and had many big stomach operations. We’ve had experienced at least 4 times that it wasn’t sure if i would make it. But last year i can say, was the hardest time of our lifes.</p>
<p>In November 2016, between two surgereys my body gave up and doctors didn’t know what to do. They did an emergency surgery it wasn’t sure if i would survive. Realizing the situation i was in, i was talking to God all the time and i He was by my side. I was really calm just talking to Him. Then suddenly I heard His voice and Lord asked me in person: “Kirsten, where do you wanna sing? In heaven before My throne, or still on earth before My throne?” The only reason i’m still on earth is that i chose last. I couldn’t leave my husband and children yet, and i told the Lord that i knew i could reach many more people with my music and by sharing my story. I recovered, but got another hard time with my illness this summer and again i found myself fighting for my life. But also this time, the Lord was near. In those hardest moments of my life, He brought comfort and inspiration to write the most personal songs of my life.  We knew at that time that we had to make a second album and tell the world my story by writing an autobiography. Cause my story isn’t about the hardships, but it is a personal story about Gods faithfullnes and hope which He’ll use to touch people’s hearts.</p>
<p>This is why i am so passionate and driven to make this album. To comfort and strenghten people including you as my listener, using my music, and by telling my story and testimony. Cause God wants to weave gold in everyone’s story. No matter how hopeless the situation may seem.</p>
<p><strong>THE RECORDING</strong></p>
<p>The recording will be a 13 songs album, with a great mix of country and southern gospel. The songs are about comfort in hard times, hope, the love of God and how He is there for you. He wants you to not only overcome your situation, but arise high above! These are songs written by the experiences and learnings we had in our hardest times.</p>
<p>I am not making this album alone. Gordon Mote will be producing, playing and do vocals on the album. And next to him we’ll have a great team lined up with Nashville’s finest and respected musicians. so we garantee you that you'll don't be dissappointed when you get the album! Gordon is a well respected musician and producer and has produced albums for many great artist/groups like the Gaither Vocal band, Voices of Lee, the Martins, and many more. He has played for music’s biggest names, including Brad Paisley, Blake Shelton, Martina McBride, Bob Seger, Alan Jackson, Rascal Flatts, Carrie Underwood, Lionel Richie, Josh Turner, Darius Rucker, and Alison Krauss—to name a few. His unmatched studio prowess has earned him two Academy of Country Music Awards for top piano/keyboard player as well as two Music Row Magazine Instrumentalist of the Year Awards (2009, 2011) for playing on the most top ten albums. Gordon is honored and humbled by the artists and producers who place their trust in him, but He stays always humble and says “I always try to bring my creativity and do the very best I can.”</p>

Since i was young i was already making music and singing. So music has always played a major part in my life. But i couldn’t imagined i would become a solo singer later in life. Before my solocareer i was musical leader and bandleader in our church; and pianist and flute player and vocalist on multiple events. I sang in bands,  and worked as backing vocalist. I did multiple projects for studio’s and artists and later i  also followed the education of master teacher in Estill voice training to complete my vocal education and be able to teach others to help them develop their voice and singing and express their emotion in music. Cause music is emotion, and it’s like a first language for me where i can express myself, be myself, get to rest or get exited when i need that. It refreshes my soul, and inspires me. Music helped me get through my toughest moments.
Most of you know that i’ve been very ill multiple times, and had many big stomach operations. We’ve had experienced at least 4 times that it wasn’t sure if i would make it. But last year i can say, was the hardest time of our lifes.
In November 2016, between two surgereys my body gave up and doctors didn’t know what to do. They did an emergency surgery it wasn’t sure if i would survive. Realizing the situation i was in, i was talking to God all the time and i He was by my side. I was really calm just talking to Him. Then suddenly I heard His voice and Lord asked me in person: “Kirsten, where do you wanna sing? In heaven before My throne, or still on earth before My throne?” The only reason i’m still on earth is that i chose last. I couldn’t leave my husband and children yet, and i told the Lord that i knew i could reach many more people with my music and by sharing my story. I recovered, but got another hard time with my illness this summer and again i found myself fighting for my life. But also this time, the Lord was near. In those hardest moments of my life, He brought comfort and inspiration to write the most personal songs of my life.  We knew at that time that we had to make a second album and tell the world my story by writing an autobiography. Cause my story isn’t about the hardships, but it is a personal story about Gods faithfullnes and hope which He’ll use to touch people’s hearts.
This is why i am so passionate and driven to make this album. To comfort and strenghten people including you as my listener, using my music, and by telling my story and testimony. Cause God wants to weave gold in everyone’s story. No matter how hopeless the situation may seem.

<h3>Why I Need Your Help</h3>
<p>I've been playing guitar professionally for over 10 years. The past few years I've refocussed on my original passion: songwriting and original music. I've written over 60 songs in the past 3 years and feel that 12 of those belong on an album that I can be proud to share with you.</p>
<p>There are many studios in Minneapolis but I've had the pleasure of working with Chris Mara of Welcome to 1979 Studios in Nashville, TN a couple of times and feel that his tastefulness, expertise, and studio are best suited for the sound I'm hoping to get on this album. After 3 years of preparation I want to make the best damn album I can. This is not the cheapest option but I truly believe it's the best.</p>

<li>I will absolutely record this album no matter how much money is raised. If we don't reach the entire goal there are studios in the immediate area that are more economical, or I'll even record it myself if I have to. It would take me a lifetime to save the money needed to have a true studio setup and the skill of a great sound engineer is invaluable.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The studio and engineer are as much, or even more, a part of the final sound than the musicians themselves. I'm asking for financial support to work with someone that I feel shares a vision with what I think music should sound like: simple, direct, &amp; warm. </p>
<p>I am fully a independent musician. I do all the booking, tour routing, songwriting, promo, rehearse the band, etc. There are many opportunities that I am immediately looked past because I don't have an album available to the public. I will continue to play open mics, songwriter nights, and every show that I can but hoping for the right person to walk in the door and offer me a record deal is a beautiful Hollywood story but generally not real. I plan to keep going regardless and this is the next step. </p>

</ul>

<ul><li>The world's gone mad, its true, and we're all feeling a little lost. More than ever, I feel the need to authentically connect with people...to help myself and to help others to feel less alone, to feel better and like we're all in this together. The best way for me to do this has always been through MUSIC! </li></ul>

I am a soul singer, born and raised in South Africa, educated in the world!
I'm currently recording my debut EP with a genius producer from London, Mr. Russell Nash. I have written songs and featured for many other artists but have yet to release my own material. It's taken me a long time to get to this point..a rollercoaster adventure of finding my sound, finding myself and the right producer.
I now have the opportunity and the magic man!
All we need is a little bit of help from you to complete the project!

What We Need & What You Get

We need funds for studio time and musicians to complete the recording process
You get to be my record label !! Essentially advancing me the money to finish the album.
Pick a perk level and get involved with the process - we'll have live studio updates, behind the scenes, q&a 's and of course, a digital download of the EP once its completed!


The Aim
The world's gone mad, its true, and we're all feeling a little lost. More than ever, I feel the need to authentically connect with people...to help myself and to help others to feel less alone, to feel better and like we're all in this together. The best way for me to do this has always been through MUSIC! 

 The Team

Candy has had a professional singing career for over a decade. She's travelled the world singing in bands, duos and most recently, theatre productions on the high seas. Candy has songwriting credits on 3 radio singles and numerous features for various artists. 
Russell Nash is an artist, songwriter, multi- instrumentalist and producer from London. Find  out more about him here:  http://www.nashmusic.biz/russell-nash/

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi everyone! We're Rand and Erin Bellavia, a husband and wife who recently started writing and performing songs together. You may know Rand as one of the singer/songwriter/guitarers of the Pegasus and Logan Award winning filk/nerd rock band <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ookla_the_Mok_(band)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ookla the Mok</a>. If you're unfamiliar with filk, it's commonly defined as the music of the science fiction and fantasy community. (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filk_music"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wikipedia</a> can tell you more, if you're interested!) If you are familiar with filk you may have seen us perform together at FilKONtario, GAFilk, Marcon, Windycon or Balticon, or heard our Pegasus-award nominated song ""Cliffs of Insanity"" at OVFF in 2016.</p>
<p>At any rate, we're releasing our first album, and we hope you're willing to help us deliver the nerd rock album of 2018!   To encourage you, we've assembled perks designed to appeal to curious musicians, fans, and nerds of all stripes, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Non-Album tracks -- otherwise unavailable ""b-sides,"" or completed songs that will not appear on the CD or MP3 versions of the album</li>
<li>An otherwise unavailable Seanan McGuire short story, featuring Erin and Rand as characters</li>
<li>Access to the demos, tempo maps, and alternative versions used to create the album</li>
<li>Custom made calligraphy bookmarks and matted songs/poems</li>
<li>...and More!</li>
</ul>
<p>We're very excited to be working with producer Jeff Thomas (Ookla fans might recognize him as the producer of the 2003 album Oh Okay LA).  Jeff is once again lending his production talents, but is also an integral part of the band, providing the drum loops as well as the guitar and keyboard parts that sound too good to have been played by Rand.  We are also joined by Mike Mallory, whose amazing bass guitar playing is Via Bella's not so secret weapon.</p>
<p>This album will also feature some very special guests, including Seanan McGuire, Urban Tapestry, Vixy &amp; Tony, Maya Bohnhoff, Doug White, Mike Brunacini, Brenda Sutton, and Amy McNally!</p>
<p>The album (currently in search of a title) will consist of the following tracks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fight Like a Girl -- we open with a perfect little slice of powerpop.  If you've seen us live you've heard this one.  ""I’ll stand up for every person in the world who’s ever heard someone say, 'You’re not a fighter, you’re just a girl'”</li>
<li>The Face of God -- a funk/disco track about social responsibility.  Yeah, you read that right.  ""We’ve all got despair to spare""</li>
<li>Fighting the Black Thing -- a folk/rock song based on Madeleine L'Engle's <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i>.  This is the song we're most excited about.  ""Engage the world with head and hand and heart""</li>
<li>How to Grow a Soul -- a very short song adapting a Kurt Vonnegut quote.  ""Write a poem for a friend""</li>
<li>Do As Peggy Says -- a powerpop track honoring Agent Peggy Carter, co-written by Rand's Ookla the Mok song-writing partner Adam English!  ""Support your friends, always offer to help, know your value, and stand up for yourself""</li>
<li>She Persisted -- a feminist ballad inspired by Susan B. Anthony, Ruby Bridges, Bree Newsome, and Elizabeth Warren.  ""The police said she’d not be released or have a moment’s peace til she ceased and desisted""</li>
<li>Dear Seanan -- a parody of Seanan McGuire's ""Dear Gina"" sung in the voice of October Daye. ""If ever I escape this book I’ll find a way to make you pay""</li>
<li>Orphan Black -- a prog rock adaptation of the text of the Orphan Black season five trailer. ""But they could not break us""</li>
<li>The Princess Who Saved Herself -- a cover of the criminally underappreciated Jonathan Coulton song.</li>
<li>Westworld -- Dolores and Maeve sing in counterpoint, and in 9/8!  ""I imagined a different kind of story""</li>
<li>Nasty -- a Celtic-rock celebration of being on the right side of history. ""We are the daughters of the witches your fathers failed to burn""</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here's our ""shoot the moon"" budget:</p>
<ul>
<li>$2,400 -- Production (recording/mixing/mastering)</li>
<li>$2,600 -- Duplication (compact discs, packaging, distribution, shipping)</li>
<li>$ 500 -- Graphic Design</li>
</ul>
<p>Rand has been recording and releasing albums for over 20 years.  He's worked with elaborate budgets and he's done albums on the cheap.  The budget for this album lies somewhere in the middle.  As producer Jeff Thomas once said, ""If you want your album to sound like a million bucks, you need to spend at least fifteen thousand dollars.""</p>
<p>If we reach our goal, we'll be able to record and package the CD of our dreams. The closer we get to that goal, the more fancy we can get with the quality of production (more elaborate arrangements, layering, re-recordings, multiples mixes, etc.) and packaging (including a lyric booklet, a professional photo shoot, etc.) </p>
<p>But regardless of how much money we raise, this project is happening, and anyone who pledges will receive a finished record and any/all accompanying perks -- see side bar for all available perks, including an otherwise unavailable Seanan McGuire short story featuring Erin and Rand as characters!</p>

<p><strong>About this project</strong><br/><br/>The songs are written. The musicians are ready. The studio is booked. Now we just need your help to make this project happen!<br/><br/>Darklighter is a new band founded by Cleveland musician and songwriter Britton Roberts (formerly of State Fair). The debut EP is an exploration of the dynamism of faith between the presence and the absence, the otherness and the nearness, the collision of the dark and the light creating the experience of transcendent mystery. Sound intriguing? Well, it can't exist without your support!</p>
<p>Music is a shared, communal experience - from the Sunday morning pew to the Saturday night pub. The success of any artist and their work is rooted in the soil of a supportive community. While most listeners are mere consumers, music lovers are active participants in the creative process. Without you we are just a clanging cymbal - an empty sound reverberating in the abyss of nothingness. Sad!</p>
<p>Please consider supporting this project, not with a handout but with an investment to help fund us on the front end and receive from a wide range of killer rewards in return.<br/><br/>Funding goes towards: Studio costs, musicians, mixing and mastering with platinum record producer Michael Seifert, graphic design, printing and online distribution. Most studio projects can cost upwards of $10,000 or more. We are doing this at a fraction of the cost while still guaranteeing a quality product.</p>
</div><div>
<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>Studio work can be grueling and time consuming. The last thing an artist wants is to rush their work out to the public before it is ready. If we are pushed off schedule it could add another month or so to our production schedule which could delay your rewards.</p>
<p>Additionally our date for the release party might not be able to accommodate everyone based on their availability. We will select and promote the date at least a month in advance so you can plan accordingly, but we cannot change the date based upon your preference. We can however accommodate dates for any house show, full band concerts, or lessons.</p>

<h3>Disco: Volver a Empezar</h3>
<p>Para donar solo dale click al boton que dice ""Back it""</p>
<ul>
<li>Despise de 12 años vuelvo a las cabinas para grabar una producción nueva.</li>
<li>Vivir de la musica en el Peru no es imposible, pero si es super difícil.  Uno tiene que hacer mil cosas para poder vivir.  Enseñar, tocar, grabar, hacer música publicitaria, etc... Grabar un disco es aun mas difícil, ya que es caro, por mas que uno sea músico, el alquiler de salas de grabación de altos estándares no son accesibles, es por eso que los músicos nos vemos obligados a hacer este tipo de campañas pro fondos.  Hoy en día existen estas plataformas de crowdfunding, pero también tenemos que hacer eventos pro fondos, conciertos, etc... muy a parte de trabajar para vivir.</li>
<li>Este disco es un sueño para mi.  Hay canciones que me han salido desde lo mas profundo del alma, de etapas de depresión, otras canciones como ""Volver a Empezar"" que habla sobre lo difícil que es volver a empezar... no podemos ofrecer lo que no tenemos.  Canciones llenas de amor, donde cada palabra sale desde el corazón. ""Alma"" es una canción que me describe perfectamente... "" pongo el alma antes del cuerpo, nunca me arrepiento... y doy el alma en cada paso, fuerza para seguir cantando, alma, para seguir soñando, para regalarte mi alma..."" De repente vienen a mi ""Fotos y recuerdos""... ""Si la vida se hubiera quedado igual, los amantes no se hubieran dejado de amar, si el recuerdo no doliera tanto, si nadie hiciera daño, si supiéramos todo lo que tenemos, antes de perderlo... si cada camino me llevara a ti, correría, para volver allí....""</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>Lo que necesitamos: </h3>
</div><div>
<ul>
<li>Necesitamos US$7,500 dolares para el proyecto.  Este dinero va destinado a la grabación del disco, a la elaboración del arte del disco, fotos, un primer tiraje de 1000 discos, 300 tarjetas de descarga (vienen con un código, entran a la web, ingresan el código y descargan el disco), merchandising y campaña de prensa.</li>
<li><p>Se preguntarán porque no suena música de bandas nuevas peruanas en las radios... la respuesta es muy sencilla.  Para sonar en medios, uno tiene que tener un presupuesto a parte para eso.  Para la difusión se necesita invertir. es por eso que dentro del presupuesto para la grabación del disco he asignado un presupuesto para prensa y difusión.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Lo que recibes por tu contribución:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Por $20 Dolares recibes 1 CD y 1 entrada doble al lanzamiento del disco.</li>

Lo que recibes por tu contribución:

Por $20 Dolares recibes 1 CD y 1 entrada doble al lanzamiento del disco.
Por $50 Dolares recibes 1 CD, 1 entrada doble al lanzamiento del disco y un kit de merchandising.
Por $100 Dolares recibes 1 CD, 2 entradas dobles VIP al lanzamiento del disco, un kit de merchandising y una invitación doble a un concierto privado.

Otras formas de ayudar:

Si quieres ayudar y no tienes dinero para donar, podrías ayudar con tu talento.  Si eres fotógrafo, productor, diseñador, etc... podrías ayudarnos con tu trabajo.

<p>StageWood Consortium  is following the path of a “Sharing Economy”, aiming to disrupt the current status of the Live Entertainment Industry by creating: “An innovative, original and unique network that connects performing artists, event Producers, Fans and entertainment enterprises with software development professionals, in an integrated platform, capitalizing the advances in Blockchain technology to secure honest, ethical relationships and eliminate unnecessary intermediaries and scalpers.”</p>
<p>StageWood provides a trusted platform where a collaborative community of Fans, Artists, and Producers operate in a mutually beneficial environment.  Fans who underwrite our concerts can take ownership pride as they may be involved in important tasks, including selecting performers and coordinating unique experiences.  By crowdfunding these events, Fans have the opportunity to enjoy a unique VIP experience and become exclusive members of our community.</p>
<p>The community strategic approach to disrupting the entertainment business focus on two distinctive efforts:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Virtual business platform development:</strong>  our ""soon to be released"" social media outlet, TyKet; a value exchange instrument, TykCoin; and our virtual exchange application, Tykwood.  These tools will help coordinate art events around the world providing a stage for seasoned and emerging artist to connect with their fans.</li>
<li>
<strong>StageWood</strong><strong> Franchise:</strong> a network of physical locations designed to include a performance stage escorted by eight award-winning chef food tasting kitchens, a mixology bar, and eight landmark micro-theaters.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<h3>A Sponsorship Packet = A Memorable Event</h3>
<p>A line up of prime artists is eager to perform at a StageWood Concert.  A budget proforma of these events has been carefully reviewed to determine the necessary resources to bring the event to life.  The financial resources required are divided into 50 crowdfunding packages.  These limited number of packages allows for an adequate coverage of coordinating expenses as well as appropriate management of rewards.</p>
<p><i><strong>Crowdfunding Fans are treated with:</strong></i></p>
<ul>
<li>Involvement in the selection of featured artist, unless already determined.</li>
<li>Exclusive invitations (4) to Pre/Post Event Party with featured Artists Meet and Greet.</li>
<li>Premium tickets to the event (4)</li>
<li>VIP Access to the event, including red carpet elite entrance and backstage lounge access.</li>
<li>Package of 20 tickets to either balcony suite (when available) or midtier section.</li>
<li>Opportunity to use tickets and VIP facilities to celebrate a special occasion with friends. </li>
<li>Opportunity to release package tickets for resale by the event promoter.</li>

<h3>The Impact</h3>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Besides the risk of not raising enough funds to cover the coordinating expenses for a concert, other hurdles may prevent our planned events.  To help minimize risks and improve our chances of delivering an outstanding performance we have arranged for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Return of Investment if appropriate funds are not raised.</li>
<li>Event cancellation insurance policy to cover expenses and allow for the refund of crowdfunding investment or exchange to an alternative event. </li>
<li>A lack of expected general public demand may drive ticket prices down, creating the risk of lower return than expected when Crowdfunders decide to sell their tickets.  There is no guarantee that placing Crowdfund package tickets back on the market will generate equal or higher return on investment. </li>

Since then, she has performed/dance captained several Nat’l and InterNat’l tours in over 20 countries. She has worked with Disney, Warner Bros, Marvel, Nickelodeon, HBO, Discovery Ch. and many more. Shortly after tour, Ms. Love began choreographing and writing lyrics Spanish Pop-icon, Nacho Cano (Mecano).

<p>Since the launch of her Pop Music career, Love has worked with several award-winning producers who’ve worked with the likes of Houston, Spears, Aguilera, Pink, Del Rey among many other power-house female vocalists.

<h2> Erdbeer!</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>“Ich glaub, ich hab mich verhört!”</p>
<p>Wir konnten es kaum glauben, als uns das Wiener Start Up ""erdbeerwoche"" auf einen gleichnamigen Song im Netz aufmerksam gemacht hat:</p>
<p><br/>Im November 2017 ging ein neuer Rap-Song des deutschen Chartstürmers KC Rebell online. Der Name des Songs ist „Erdbeerwoche“ und die Klicks auf Youtube haben die 4 Millionen Grenze bereits überschritten. Warum?</p>
<p>Gemeinsam mit Summer Cem und Elias, zwei weiteren angesagten deutschen Rappern, lässt sich KC Rebell ungehemmt über sein Problem mit dem Menstruationszyklus aus und beschimpft eine fiktive (oder womöglich im echten Leben existente) „Bitch“, dass sie doch bitte abhauen soll, wenn sie ihn beim ersten Date „ein bisschen geil macht, und dann erwartet dass er sich's alleine macht“. Ein starkes, obercooles Role-Model für junge Burschen und Männer kann eben nicht „abwarten und Tee trinken“, denn (Zitat!) „wenn´s vorne nicht geht, dann geht´s hinten, wenn´s hinten nicht geht, dann geht´s oben. Es gibt eine Million Methoden!“</p>
<p>Die Bitch wird heimgeschickt und KC Rebells Herz ist gebrochen. Unsere Herzen auch, denn wir können nach viereinhalb Minuten Prolo-Reimen nicht fassen, wie sehr die Frau, die weibliche Sexualität und der Menstruationszyklus hier ins Lächerliche gezogen werden. Irgendwie haben wir bis zum Ende des Songs gehofft, dass es eine Wendung gibt – vielleicht war ja alles nur ein schlechter Scherz? Ein sehr schlechter … Aber das passiert nicht. KC Rebell´s letzte Worte sind und bleiben: „Ich hoff du findest hier raus“, womit er hunderttausenden von jungen Mädchen das Gefühl gibt, dass sie gefälligst gefügig zu sein haben, egal, wie sie sich gerade fühlen. Die Botschaft ist unmissverständlich die, dass, wenn der Mann es haben will, er es auch bekommen soll. Ein Nein zählt nicht. Und die Menstruation ist sowieso nur eine schwache Ausrede einer „ehrenlosen, arroganten“ Schlampe.</p>
<p>Wir suchen im Netz nach pro-feministischen Antworten und finden … Katja Krasavice. Sie singt – spärlich bekleidet – „Gib’s mir doggy, gib’s mir doggy, gib’s mir doggy …“</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Aufgeklärt...ähm... wie jetzt?</strong></p>
<p>Im Gespräch mit  sexualpädagogisch tätigen Teams wird VAGINAS IM DIRNDL schnell klar, dass die Popkultur Jugendliche stark beeinflusst und in Fällen wie solchen auch sehr verunsichert. Vor allem für junge Mädchen werden solche Videos zu gefährlichen Manipulationsmitteln. Auch wenn sie lustig gemeint sind (was wir nicht finden), knabbern sie auf einer unterbewussten Ebene am Selbstwert junger Mädchen und Frauen und bewerben Sexualität als Leistungssport oder Performance, zu der man (frau) immer bereit sein sollte, damit der (männliche) andere zufrieden ist.</p>
<p>Was passiert da gerade mit unserer aufgeklärten Gesellschaft? Welche Frauenbilder werden da verbreitet? Und wollen wir einfach so zusehen?</p>

<p>Ja, VAGINAS IM DIRNDL haben um öffentliche Födergelder bei Fraueneinrichtungen angesucht. Nein, sie haben sie nicht bekommen. Das hier ist Plan B.</p>
<p>B wie Backtriebmittel.</p>
<p>Unser finanzielles Ziel bei dieser Kampagne sind 5000 EUR, mit denen wir Produktionskosten wie KünstlerInnengagen, Soundstudio, Technisches Equipment, Kostüme, Ausstattung, Transport und Verpflegung bezahlen werden. Wir sind bemüht, unsere Kosten so gering wie möglich zu halten und gleichzeitig streben wir eine qualitativ hochwertige künstlerische Gesamtleistung an.</p>
<p>Der Produktionszeitraum beläuft sich auf mehr als zwei Monate, in denen Lyrics geschrieben, Sounds gesampelt, Musik komponiert, gemischt, gemastert, genäht, gedreht, geschnitten, organisiert, parodiert, geschminkt, kostümiert, frisiert und gebacken wird. Daran sind viele Menschen beteiligt, die an unser Projekt glauben und uns mit ihrer Tatkraft und Expertise unterstützen.  Mit eurer Unterstützung können wir das noch besser tun.</p>
<p>Als unsere UnterstützerInnen bekommt ihr speziell für diesen Zweck zugeschnittene ""Perks"" von ""Erdbeerwoche"" Fanartikeln bis hin zur einmaligen Chance, bei unserer Videopräsentation im Herbst 2018 als Special Guests mit dabei zu sein.</p>
<p>Und was passiert, wenn VAGINAS IM DIRNDL ihr Ziel von 5000 EUR nicht erreichen?</p>

<h3>Unser Ziel</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Ziel unseres Projektes ERDBEERWOCHE ist die Realisation eines pro-feministischen, provokanten Musikvideos bestehend aus Rap-Elementen vermischt mit typisch alpenländischem Sound, in dem wir eine Antwort auf KC Rebell´s vorvorgestriges Weltbild geben. Unsere Antwort ist friedlich, lustvoll und frech. Und wird hoffentlich ein Ohrwurm. Krieg wollen wir keinen – vielmehr wollen wir eine Diskussionsplattform schaffen, wo Stimmen aller Beteiligten hörbar werden. Und wir wollen zeigen, dass Feminismus auch humorvoll sein kann und Spaß machen darf. Junge Mädchen und Frauen sollen durch den neuen ERDBEERWOCHE Song dazu inspiriert werden, auf sich und ihren Körper zu hören und selbstbewusst mit jenem umzugehen. Wir wollen in unserem Song betonen, dass es bei einem ersten Date eben nicht zwingend zu Sex kommen muss – auch wenn KC rebelliert – und dass gegenseitiges Verständnis, Entscheidungsfreiheit und gute, wertschätzende Kommunikation das Um und Auf für eine erfüllende sexuelle Begegnung sind.</p>
<p>Das Musikvideo für die ERDBEERWOCHE bietet uns auf visueller Ebene noch einmal mehr die Chance, auf althergebrachte Role-Model Bilder einzugehen und diese auf die Schippe zu nehmen. Unsere Story beginnt da, wo KC Rebell´s Geduld endet. Unsere Version der ERDBEERWOCHE zeigt drei brave Hausfrauen beim Backen einer Erdbeertorte – so wie früher – rückschrittig sozusagen. Wobei schnell klar wird, dass wir den Schritt nach vorne wagen. Blut wird dabei nie fließen, unsere Erdbeeren sind sinnlich und rot genug! Housewive Dreams der 60ies, süßes Schlagobers und schwarze Dirndln im Gangsterlook erzeugen einen parodistischen Remix von stereotypen Bildern und neuen, starken Frauen-Stimmen. Unsere Version der ERDBEERWOCHE ist eine neue, innovative Rezeptur für Geschlechtergerechtigkeit. Wir backen gemeinsam einen Kuchen. Und teilen ihn gerne im Netz.</p>

There's always live music everywhere in Barcelona""</strong></p><p>Each song you hear in Spotify or iTunes requires a Producer, a Recording Studio, Mastering and a Marketing Team so that the song gets discovered, played and shared-- and thus benefits the musician. That overall cost is often overlooked.<br/><br/>Pursuing any career is a challenge, but for musicians in Barcelona it has become exceptionally hard. It doesn’t matter if you are a local Catalan singer-songwriter or an expat British band, the perception here has started to be that buying drinks in a bar or music venue means live music comes with a drink (and that the musicians get paid well).  People willingly pay 15-20 euros on a DJ who plays other people’s music, and 40-50 on a night out, but often hesitate to pay as little as 5 euros to see a live band. <br/> </p><h2>Where does the money go?</h2><ul>

<strong>ZAQ SQUARES writes almost every day and is one of the most hardworking artists we know. He is prepared to hit the Studio tomorrow, collaborating with local Barcelona artists.</strong><br/>Listen to his <u><a href=""https://open.spotify.com/artist/62ktskrMSc4RMdhpWPNIz4?si=shBz4eSbTFild-EiFmrG3g"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Spotify</a></u> and the <u><a href=""https://www.frontpagenewsbcn.com/artists-we-admire-zaq-squares"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Playlist we curated for him and in our website</a></u>.<br/>He has so much more where that has come from.<br/>Your contribution will go towards helping him record and master his next releases.<br/>We are confident he can record two songs in just half a day's recording.<br/><br/> </li>

<strong>A SONG WITH A FULL BAND OF 8</strong><br/>Recording a full horn section is a bigger challenge than many people would think. The Monkey Men have 2 formats: 5-piece band or 8-piece band. It is time for their full horn section to be recorded professionally where each sound is as distinct and beautiful as their live set. We watch them every Saturday we can - watch out for the next video we post!<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>A PRODUCER </strong><br/>We have found a beautiful producer we have a lot of respect for (more about them in our next update). He has David Gray and Josh Groban in his discography of artists he has worked with directly. He has always wanted to be part of a project that has a full horn section! What are the odds, right?! This however is a personal relationship between Artist &amp; Producer -- we will let THEM share the story of their music relationship as it unfolds.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>EPIC VIDEO</strong><br/>Every band needs at least 1 awesome video. This requires a Director, Production Crew, Camera Operator, Lighting People, Grips, Gaffs, Sound AND editing time. This may involve a drone or projection mapping. Creative discussions are underway. We have a few people waiting to make this happen for us; in fact one of them is currently working with the<strong> Metallica World Tour Crew</strong> (more about them in our next update also!)<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>MARKETING</strong><br/>We realise that for every artist-- juggling The <strong>Zaq Squares, Liam Cloud, Adeline</strong> or <strong>The Monkey Men</strong> artist thing PLUS <i>marketing themselves</i> as artists-- can be extremely difficult. This is exactly how <u><a href=""https://www.frontpagenewsbcn.com/why"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Front Page News Team </a></u>started and is just one of the reasons everyone in our team are completely behind these artists to help the local Barcelona Scene -- They need better instagramming campaigns and YouTube marketing and all the essential marketing and content machine stuff hat musicians need today. So it's a win-win for us to be part of this passion project.<br/> </li>
<li>
<strong>WRITERS &amp; STORY TELLERS</strong><br/>We need people to have conversations about Front Page News and the artists we love  while we're busy recording, writing new songs and putting on great events.

<br/>Do you have any questions for us? </h3><p>I'm sure we'll be talking more over the next few weeks.</p></div>","""But what's the problem? There's always live music everywhere in Barcelona""Each song you hear in Spotify or iTunes requires a Producer, a Recording Studio, Mastering and a Marketing Team so that the song gets discovered, played and shared-- and thus benefits the musician. That overall cost is often overlooked.Pursuing any career is a challenge, but for musicians in Barcelona it has become exceptionally hard. It doesn’t matter if you are a local Catalan singer-songwriter or an expat British band, the perception here has started to be that buying drinks in a bar or music venue means live music comes with a drink (and that the musicians get paid well).  People willingly pay 15-20 euros on a DJ who plays other people’s music, and 40-50 on a night out, but often hesitate to pay as little as 5 euros to see a live band.  Where does the money go?
We will be producing Spanish and Catalan versions of the website frontpagenewsbcn.com as well as spending on marketing costs for marketing in the local languages.   
We will be recording and mastering songs by three artists featured in this Indiegogo page, who are part of our Spring Campaign. We have events and artists booked for our Autumn and Winter events. This Playlist is refreshed weekly: Barcelona Acts we love on Spotify

 You can help four artists (and more) take their next steps in advancing their careers. You can also help enliven local audiences to be part of a thriving artist community.
Meet Barcelona Artists we love and believe in...Each musician and band we have met is at a different point of their evolution as Artists: Zaq Squares is new to Barcelona but certainly not to epic singing and beautiful songwriting. There is always that unmistakable pause in a conversation (or thought) when Zaq bellows something raw in a song about pain, hope or some other melancholic moment.

<h3>Welcome, I am so very excited you stopped by!</h3>
<p>My name is Hannah Dawber. I am a singer-songwriter based in New England. I started singing when I started speaking and taught myself the guitar when I was 12. My style embraces indie, folk, and art-pop vibes. Think Gabriella Aplin meets Maggie Rogers with a touch of the Lumineers. I am a dreamer and bird lover. I admire when others tell me their story. I am an optimist and get jazzed over good conversations. And I tend to eat peanut butter every day.</p>
<p>But what we are really here for is to talk about the dream I’ve had my whole life unfolding before my very eyes. </p>
<p>It’s real people…. <br/>I will be recording my first album this fall!!!</p>
<p>Have you ever met someone, applied for a job, or had a conversation and although you might not have had all the pieces figured out, you just knew it was right for you? That is how I felt when I got off my first conference call about this dream. </p>
<p>Old Bear Records, located in upstate NY is where I will record. My dear friend and producer, Jonas Woods introduced me to Chris Hoisington of Old Bear Records and Brothers McClurg in early fall 2018.  Each conversation following that first has confirmed this perfect fit for me.</p>
<p>Recording isn’t cheap and I am not very good at this, but teamwork makes the dream work right? </p>
<p>I am inviting you to join me on this journey as I pursue a dream I just can’t shake. As the bio says above- the impossible is possible and I whole heartily believe in this or I wouldn’t do it. Any amount helps- but we only got 60 days! If I’m being raw- that petrifies me, but I believe God’s faithful hand will see this through. </p>
<p>THANK YOU!!! for your encouragement, love, joy, and prayers through my musical journey thus far and thank you for what is to come! This isn’t just a journey about me making music, this is a journey about learning about the more we are all capable of. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>More about me… </strong></p>
<p>I grew up surrounded by a family that jams together. Every holiday, get together, weekend, or whatever it was, music was embedded in it all. I thought it was normal and all my friend’s families did the same. I quickly found out in high school that that wasn’t the case. I was very shy growing up and would make my mom, or whoever was watching turn around as I would share a “new hit”- It was usually a cheesy song about what I thought love was. Not many people in high school knew I sang. My biggest regret was leaving the Beauty and the Beast audition when I was 15 because I was so afraid what my peers would think of me. As I aged, I have learned- still learning- how to combat those vicious lies. I began performing more and recorded a few rough songs in my cousin’s basement. Nothing was consistent, but I was proud and passionate each time I worked on music. I played small gigs throughout college and after graduating traveled the world doing missions work- guitar in hand. Through it all, I have come to love what rhythms, harmonies, and lyrics bring out. I love watching a crowd feel each note and sing along to each story. It’s the most beautiful thing. </p>
<p>This past year I continued to battle myself. Do I pursue this thing or not? Is it too late? Am I as good as people in my family or the people out there already? Would anyone even want to hear what I have to say? Those lies have spoken loud, but they have not stopped me. </p>
<p>In the last 27 years, I've learned- finally, that being you is enough. All the beautiful AND quirky things that come along with being human is what makes us perfect. It is human being not perfect being, right? I have also learned how much more we are capable of accomplishing. No matter how little money or self-esteem you have, you can do more. It is possible. </p>
<p>I could go another year wondering what would have happened if I stepped out of my comfort zone into the unknown or I could just do it. </p>
<p>Let’s just DO IT! (no, this isn’t a sponsor for Nike- I work for Timberland ehh) </p>
<p>Thank you once again for being a great human. <br/><strong>You are loved and cherished. </strong></p>
<p>Until next time,<br/>Check out my <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/hannahdawbs/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Instagram</a> for snippets of my songs and covers of humans I look up too along the way! </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Mary Vanhoozer-Rodriguez. I'm a pianist and recording artist with a passion for sharing music with live audiences, as well as for bringing great music into people's homes and communities through audio recordings. I am especially excited about the music of J. S. Bach; his music features both a purity and rich complexity, a rare sound-world in our current culture. Bach's music is particularly meaningful to me because it exudes a deep joy, not simply a superficial happiness. Originally, Bach wrote these partitas for amateurs of music, 'for their spiritual enjoyment and the refreshment of their minds.' In Bach's day it was not uncommon for amateurs to play at the level where they could play these partitas. Today, it is sadly less common, and for me this is yet another compelling reason to share Bach's music: by recording each of these pieces on our Yamaha C3 model in our living room, I even re-created the most common setting in which contemporaries of Bach would have played. By helping support our campaign you will also help make this joyful music come to life in other people's homes and communities. </p>
<p>It's also a great privilege to premiere Josh Rodriguez's Partita for Piano. This newly commissioned piece is a beautiful, colorful, and dramatic gem written in five movements: Toccata, Minuet, Fugue, Passacaglia, and a dance inspired by Electronic Dance Music. The opportunity to share this special new work with audiences would be an honor for me and a gift to them. A word about the composer: Josh Rodriguez was born in Cordoba, Argentina. He spent his childhood in Guatemala and Mexico. After completing his doctorate from the University of California, Los Angeles, he has worked on numerous film and classical music commissions. To listen to his work, please visit: joshrodriguezmusic.com.</p>
<p>We also are excited to have theologian Kevin Vanhoozer on the team: he will be contributing an essay, elaborating on Bach's connection with the Reformation, and how this theology impacted Bach's music.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>A project of this magnitude would typically cost well over $6,000. We have already saved and budgeted the first $3,000 for the recording and mixing, and have hired Todd Maki as our sound engineer (<a href=""http://www.toddmakicomposing.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.toddmakicomposing.com/</a>). We are using industry standard microphones and mixing techniques and exploring various distribution possibilities. Our campaign is asking for $3,000 to master the tracks, and to manufacture, print and distribute the album as both digital download and collectible CD. As entrepreneurs we rely on friends and lovers of music to help us bring our vision to life. We are making this collectible 2-CD set and theological essay for you. Your contribution will help us finish this exciting interdisciplinary project. There are various contributions you can make, with specific perks for each one. </p>
<p>This is not our first time raising money to make an album: in 2015 I successfully reached my campaign goal to fund an album of original songs, called 'Songs of Day and Night.' I also successfully campaigned to fund the Brahms’ Ghost Piano Trio tour in Southern California in March 2016, where we played several outreach concerts, worked with students, and premiered a newly commissioned work at Biola University and Westmont College.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

In Bach's day it was not uncommon for amateurs to play at the level where they could play these partitas. Today, it is sadly less common, and for me this is yet another compelling reason to share Bach's music: by recording each of these pieces on our Yamaha C3 model in our living room, I even re-created the most common setting in which contemporaries of Bach would have played. By helping support our campaign you will also help make this joyful music come to life in other people's homes and communities. 
It's also a great privilege to premiere Josh Rodriguez's Partita for Piano. This newly commissioned piece is a beautiful, colorful, and dramatic gem written in five movements: Toccata, Minuet, Fugue, Passacaglia, and a dance inspired by Electronic Dance Music. The opportunity to share this special new work with audiences would be an honor for me and a gift to them. A word about the composer: Josh Rodriguez was born in Cordoba, Argentina. He spent his childhood in Guatemala and Mexico. After completing his doctorate from the University of California, Los Angeles, he has worked on numerous film and classical music commissions. To listen to his work, please visit: joshrodriguezmusic.com.
We also are excited to have theologian Kevin Vanhoozer on the team: he will be contributing an essay, elaborating on Bach's connection with the Reformation, and how this theology impacted Bach's music.

What We Need & What You Get
A project of this magnitude would typically cost well over $6,000. We have already saved and budgeted the first $3,000 for the recording and mixing, and have hired Todd Maki as our sound engineer (http://www.toddmakicomposing.com/). We are using industry standard microphones and mixing techniques and exploring various distribution possibilities. Our campaign is asking for $3,000 to master the tracks, and to manufacture, print and distribute the album as both digital download and collectible CD. As entrepreneurs we rely on friends and lovers of music to help us bring our vision to life. We are making this collectible 2-CD set and theological essay for you. Your contribution will help us finish this exciting interdisciplinary project. There are various contributions you can make, with specific perks for each one. 
This is not our first time raising money to make an album: in 2015 I successfully reached my campaign goal to fund an album of original songs, called 'Songs of Day and Night.' I also successfully campaigned to fund the Brahms’ Ghost Piano Trio tour in Southern California in March 2016, where we played several outreach concerts, worked with students, and premiered a newly commissioned work at Biola University and Westmont College.

Other Ways You Can Help
We understand that not everyone can give financially, but you can still contribute! If you like what we're doing, please share our campaign with friends via email, Facebook, etc., and get them excited about this too!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>History and Purpose</h3>
<p>I began my musical journey in 2013 and have not stopped since. It has been crazy, exciting, and fulfilling. There is nothing better than knowing what it is that makes your heart keep ticking and doing it, really doing it.  My first EP ""Free Birds"" recorded in Brazil with producer, Ton Molinari, was released in 2014.  Since releasing ""Free Birds"", I have grown as an artist, finding my sound has been quite a journey and, honestly, I think I'll forever be on it.  However, finding a reason to sing was never been an issue. </p>
<p>I am passionate about singing with purpose, singing with truth and hope soaked into the lyrics.  I am blessed to have been a finalist in the Unsigned Only song writing competition with my single ""Merman"" released in 2015.  In a nationwide search for the next Nashville star, I was top 10 out of 715 contestants, but I chose not to continue in the contest feeling that I needed to be true to myself and my music.  That was an extremely hard decision.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am so grateful for the support I have received thus far and I'm so pumped to finish my next EP.  I'm working with Producer, Matt Moss, from Lake Charles, Louisiana.  I felt I needed a product that represented me well, something that would launch me into my next step. I know you guys will love it.  Speaking of next step, I hope to tour/move mid 2017 to spread the music and the love.  I think it's a little scary and challenging to leave everything you know in a little town to some booming city with just a little change in your pocket and a strong will to go for it.  OK so the point----the campaign.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why I Need You.</h3>
<p>Here are some ways your contributions will help me:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Studio Time/Production.</strong> Including costs of recording, editing, and mixing. (Each song costs over $1,000)</li>
<li>
<strong>Printing Physical Albums.</strong> So you can get a cool hard copy and jam it in your car.</li>
<li>
<strong>Graphic Design.</strong> (logos, album art, web design, merch design) every artists needs the internet game strong, got to get with the times.</li>
<li>
<strong>Publicity/Promo. </strong>Includes helping me reach more people through touring, I wanna go far and wide! (I am willing to sleep in my car, but I do have to eat.)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
</div><div>
<p>I believe this EP is a statement of courage.  It's the thing that's scary.  The thing where your heart says ""this is all I've ever wanted and you're trembling as you wait to expose you heART to the world. </p>
<p>In supporting me:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are become a co-laborer with me in reaching my dreams and my God-dreams.</li>
<li>You are giving permission for ALL the dreamers to dream</li>
<li>And you are helping me reach more ears that need to hear hope</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest risk is putting all the funds into an EP and not having sufficient funds to travel and promote the music. Touring on my own as a woman would be challenging; however, I'm quite sure... when there's a will there is a way.  I believe that GRIT/PERSISTENCE is key to overcoming any challenges that may come my way, and I have that.  I believe in myself and I believe in the power of music. When you know what it is you were born to do, it's very easy to be all-in and let nothing get in the way.</p>

<h3>Short Bio</h3>
<p>Jet Lemon Band was created in 2014 in Weimar, Germany. The initial focus of this group was to cover songs of the great rock bands of the 70's. After several rehearsals, however, our inspiration morphed into a desire to honour just one legendary group, Led Zeppelin, with an album titled LED ZEPPELIN II (The Full Album), recreating the genius of this band in the style of jazz. Our mutual respect for this world-renown group has driven our re-arrangement of each song from scratch. The amazing talents of our musicians have fused seamlessly and organically throughout the process of creating this album.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1488806727/y1y0nddzojmxvkyn8fdg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><i><strong>The reaction to this album has been overwhelming, resulting in invitations to perform at local festivals, as well as solo gigs at jazz clubs around Thuringia, Germany. So far, our fans' reactions have exceeded our expectations, expressing their enthusiasm for this new take on Led Zeppelin. We are loving the opportunity to embody the life of two very different styles of music--Jazz and Rock--in one cohesive album, and to capture the imaginations of both fan bases.</strong></i></p>

<p><strong><i>But you'll be better off hearing the stuff once than reading about it a hundred times! Please, check out the song, entitled ""Thank You"".</i></strong></p>
<p>This cover album will feature a number of diverse styles in addition to Contemporary Jazz, including Latin, Funk, and Vanguard. We tried to stick to expressive line from the first to the final note. We have finished the album at the studio and only thing left to do is a mastering. The final product will be 50 minutes, and will match the sequence of songs in the original LED ZEPPELIN album.</p>
<h3>Our band consists of:</h3>
<p><i><u>Jim AvivA - lead singer, keyboards</u></i></p>

</div></div>","Short Bio
Jet Lemon Band was created in 2014 in Weimar, Germany. The initial focus of this group was to cover songs of the great rock bands of the 70's. After several rehearsals, however, our inspiration morphed into a desire to honour just one legendary group, Led Zeppelin, with an album titled LED ZEPPELIN II (The Full Album), recreating the genius of this band in the style of jazz. Our mutual respect for this world-renown group has driven our re-arrangement of each song from scratch. The amazing talents of our musicians have fused seamlessly and organically throughout the process of creating this album.
 

The reaction to this album has been overwhelming, resulting in invitations to perform at local festivals, as well as solo gigs at jazz clubs around Thuringia, Germany. So far, our fans' reactions have exceeded our expectations, expressing their enthusiasm for this new take on Led Zeppelin. We are loving the opportunity to embody the life of two very different styles of music--Jazz and Rock--in one cohesive album, and to capture the imaginations of both fan bases.

But you'll be better off hearing the stuff once than reading about it a hundred times! Please, check out the song, entitled ""Thank You"".
This cover album will feature a number of diverse styles in addition to Contemporary Jazz, including Latin, Funk, and Vanguard. We tried to stick to expressive line from the first to the final note. We have finished the album at the studio and only thing left to do is a mastering. The final product will be 50 minutes, and will match the sequence of songs in the original LED ZEPPELIN album.
Our band consists of:
Jim AvivA - lead singer, keyboards
Sammy Lukas - piano, keyboards, saxophone, backup vocals
Ju Young Cheong - guitars
Benjamin Schlothauer - bass guitar
Jakob Kufert - drums
All of the musicians are graduates of Weimar School of Jazz and bring their own unique flavor to our sound.

Wanna Whole Lotta Love

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi friends, family, and all you good Indiegogo supporters. My name is Ras Gumbo, I'm a musician from Tanzania, East Africa. I've been singing since my childhood and writing songs for many years. This is my chance to release my first album, a goal I've been working towards for more than fourteen years. Music is the best teacher in life and my music is about making positive changes. In the last two years, I've released 1 audio and 3 videos on YouTube. You can check out my latest video release called <strong>CORRUPTION</strong> below.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>I need <strong>$5,000</strong> in total and it breaks down like this....</p>
<p><strong>$2,300</strong> to produce, record, mix and master two songs; copy CDs and print CD covers.</p>
<p><strong>$1,700 </strong>to organise a launch show - venue, stage, sound and lighting equipment, security, permits, live video recording.</p>
<p><strong>$1,000 </strong>Marketing and advertising - TV, radio and print.</p>
</div><div>
<p>If I don't manage to reach my goal of $5,000 I intend to prioritise getting my music to the people so I will finish recording the album and distribute it digitally. </p>
<p>The rewards are all about the music - that's what I'm all about and that's what my team is all about! I don't have a website yet - that will happen after the album is launched so digital music will be emailed instead of downloaded. </p>
<p>Depending on the perk you select, you will get some combination of the following: <strong>digital copies of each of 4 singles </strong>already<strong> </strong>released sent to your inbox; a  <strong>digital copy of the new album </strong>Daily Teaching sent to your inbox; a <strong>physical copy of  the new album</strong> Daily Teaching shipped to your door; a <strong>DVD copy of the live launch show </strong>shipped to your door. See the panel on the right for the details of the reward packs. Everyone who supports this campaign will be <strong>thanked publicly </strong>by having their name included on the friends and supporters wall that will be displayed at the live album launch show.</p>
<p>The team is working on making merchandise available (T-shirts etc) so hopefully we will add some more good things to the perks but the budget is tight so we don't want to commit until we are sure we can deliver.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>What is more important than discovering new experiences in this world? This is a chance for people to discover inspiration from original roots reggae music. Inspiration to make a positive change and to make the world a better place. </p>
<p>We know that <strong>Power</strong> can create a lot of <strong>Corruption</strong>, but we <strong>Give Thanks and Praises</strong> that no matter what, still, <strong>We Got Love, </strong> and we know thats all we need to change the world and make the world a better place.<strong> </strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There is a risk that if I don't reach my target it will take me more time to do everything I want to do, but I've made it this far and I'm very confident that I will be able to finish this album <strong><u>no matter what</u></strong>. It may take a bit more time, so your copy might be a bit late, but I am sure that you will get it in the end.</p>
<p>The biggest risk is that if I don't reach my target I won't be able to organise the launch show. If that happens, there is a possibility that the show will be delayed long term, so it may not be possible to fulfil the perk including the live video of the launch show. If that happens, the team will come up with a new item or items to replace it and we will let everyone know as soon as possible.</p>

<p>
</p><p>On November 5<sup>th</sup>, 1996, Beat Factory released the seminal hip-hop compilation, <i>Rap Essentials Volume One</i>. Featuring the likes of such budding superstars as Kardinal Offishall, Choclair and Rascalz, the album also included the now-iconic debut single “Dear Hip Hop” by Scarborough, Ontario-based lyricist, Dan-e-o. Today, the song is considered a classic by enthusiasts of the genre worldwide. In 2016, Dan-e-o will celebrate the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the legendary track and everything it stands for. And we’d like to celebrate with all of you!</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>So how can you get involved? </b></p>
<p>
</p><p>Without the fans, a record label wouldn't be able to advance the money needed to make an album. Instead of turning to a major record label, these days an artist can turn to the fans in order to fund projects, as many have already proven. Dan-e-o would like both friends and fans alike to help create both the celebratory ""<i>Dear Hip Hop: 20</i><i><sup>th</sup></i><i> Anniversary Deluxe Edition""</i> album and documentary, by not only helping with funding but also help deciding who Dan-e-o will work with on this project. It will all be up to the fans and Dan-e-o to work together!</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Dan-e-o to complete this incredible venture, he will need to fund both projects which are set to include a series of brand new incarnations of “Dear Hip Hop”. It will involve the creation of new music (recording, mixing, mastering, guests, features etc.), the creation of new packaging (design, photography, more designing, etc.), the filming of new music videos (those get expensive), the financing of a tour to promote the new project (travel expenses, marketing/promotions), the filming and editing of the documentary and last but not least, the duplication of enough physical copies of the new album to meet the requirements of big name retail distribution chains (HMV, Walmart, Best Buy etc.) </p>
<p>
</p><p>Seeing these projects through to fruition will all depend on how much money is raised to pay for all of the above-mentioned tasks. Doing so will allow Dan-e-o to finally create his full-length ode to hip-hop as a professionally solid product for stores to shelve. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You are now the record label! (It's better this way. What do those yuppies in suits know anyway, right?) You - the fans - will help Dan-e-o to fund the ""<i>Dear Hip Hop: 20</i><i><sup>th</sup></i><i> Anniversary Deluxe Edition""</i> album and documentary through the various perks you choose. Together, we will listen to suggestions from all contributors, including your selections for vocalists and producers who will be invited to enter contests to participate on the album. Dan-e-o wants all of you to be involved every step of the way!</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>What are those contests we speak of?  </b></p>
<p>
</p><p>This is where things get really interesting! Dan-e-o welcomes emcees to visit <a href=""http://dearhiphop.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://dearhiphop.com</span></a> to download the original “Dear Hip Hop” instrumental so that they can record their own guest verses for inclusion in new 2016 incarnations of the classic track! With YOUR help, Dan-e-o will choose his favourite verses and feature them on the<i> Dear Hip Hop: 20</i><i><sup>th</sup></i><i> Anniversary Deluxe Edition</i> album.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As well, producers are encouraged to visit <a href=""http://dearhiphop.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://dearhiphop.com</span></a> and download the “Dear Hip Hop” a capella so that they can create the own original remixes to the song. With YOUR help, Dan-e-o will choose his favourite beat to create an exclusive new cut for the album!</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460926818/Instagram_Dan-e-o-5_copy_m9m0xu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, for all those who aren't emcees or producers, but still want to voice what hip-hop means to them, we welcome you all to visit <a href=""http://dearhiphop.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>http://dearhiphop.com</span></a> and write a letter to hip-hop that you can share on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, with the hashtag #dearhiphop. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460926853/Instagram_Dan-e-o-4_copy_r4uppc.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>What we need and what you get...</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you know, we need the necessary funding to make this all happen! But what do you get out of the whole deal?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will receive such perks as early editions of the ""<i>Dear Hip Hop: 20</i><i><sup>th</sup></i><i> Anniversary Deluxe Edition""</i> album, private parties with performances from Dan-e-o himself, tickets to shows on his tour, exclusive merchandising to crowd-funders only, your name in the documentary’s credits (all crowdfunders included) and much more. Let’s not forget that you will play an integral role in making history by helping Dan-e-o to complete these celebratory projects!</p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1460958980/crowdchart1_Dan-e-o-4_copy_s3kyqg.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the entire goal isn't met, Dan-e-o and his team will do everything they can to work with what they have. Obviously, the more funding we receive, the better the projects will be. Of course, something will always be better than (an advance from a major record label) nothing!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every contribution counts, from $1.00 to $10,000.00! From one share of this campaign to 100 shares of the campaign. It all helps. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Side note...</b></p>
<p>You can donate any amount by typing in the amount under ""Your Contribution"" just above the perks. </p>
<p>
</p><p><b>It’s the Dan-e-o album every fan has ever wanted to hear!</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you've ever said to yourself, “I'd like to hear Dan-e-o on a track with _____”, this is the greatest chance to get that to happen! With a classic track like “Dear Hip Hop” celebrating its 20<sup>th</sup> year of existence, Dan-e-o has proven that the best emcees in the game are the ones who enjoy longevity. Meanwhile, Dan-e-o feels like he’s just getting started! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you can contribute to the next phase of his career in the strongest way possible. By donating straight into the artist’s hands, the artist can create exactly what you want!</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>If we're able to raise more than the goal...</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned, the projects will only get better! Basically, the amazing features that we have suggested in the perks can only be achieved if you really want them. The project can only go as far as YOU take it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Where the money goes...</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>    Features - Even big name artists need to pay other big names to feature on their tracks. Estimated at ($2,000.00+).</p>
<p>    Recording - (4 days of recording x $250 a day = $1,000)</p>
<p>    Mixing/Mastering - (Roughly $100 - $200 a track) Estimated at 14 tracks = Low $1,500.00 Highest (Best quality) = $2,000.00</p>
<p>    Merchandising (Shirts, Hats, Sweaters, Bobbleheads, etc...) We estimate around $5,000-$10,000.00 in merchandising needed.</p>
<p>    Marketing/Videos is estimated at around $10,000-$25,000.00 (3 Videos)</p>
<p>    Advertising is estimated to be at $1,500.00 min.</p>
<p>    Album duplication will need a start of $2,500-10,000.00 to reach the retail stores we'd like to reach.</p>
<p>    Publicist - min of $1,500.00 to start.</p><p></p><p><span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""></span></p><div>

On November 5th, 1996, Beat Factory released the seminal hip-hop compilation, Rap Essentials Volume One. Featuring the likes of such budding superstars as Kardinal Offishall, Choclair and Rascalz, the album also included the now-iconic debut single “Dear Hip Hop” by Scarborough, Ontario-based lyricist, Dan-e-o. Today, the song is considered a classic by enthusiasts of the genre worldwide. In 2016, Dan-e-o will celebrate the 20th anniversary of the legendary track and everything it stands for. And we’d like to celebrate with all of you!

So how can you get involved? 

Without the fans, a record label wouldn't be able to advance the money needed to make an album. Instead of turning to a major record label, these days an artist can turn to the fans in order to fund projects, as many have already proven. Dan-e-o would like both friends and fans alike to help create both the celebratory ""Dear Hip Hop: 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition"" album and documentary, by not only helping with funding but also help deciding who Dan-e-o will work with on this project. It will all be up to the fans and Dan-e-o to work together!

For Dan-e-o to complete this incredible venture, he will need to fund both projects which are set to include a series of brand new incarnations of “Dear Hip Hop”. It will involve the creation of new music (recording, mixing, mastering, guests, features etc.), the creation of new packaging (design, photography, more designing, etc.), the filming of new music videos (those get expensive), the financing of a tour to promote the new project (travel expenses, marketing/promotions), the filming and editing of the documentary and last but not least, the duplication of enough physical copies of the new album to meet the requirements of big name retail distribution chains (HMV, Walmart, Best Buy etc.) 

Seeing these projects through to fruition will all depend on how much money is raised to pay for all of the above-mentioned tasks. Doing so will allow Dan-e-o to finally create his full-length ode to hip-hop as a professionally solid product for stores to shelve. 

You are now the record label! (It's better this way. What do those yuppies in suits know anyway, right?) You - the fans - will help Dan-e-o to fund the ""Dear Hip Hop: 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition"" album and documentary through the various perks you choose. Together, we will listen to suggestions from all contributors, including your selections for vocalists and producers who will be invited to enter contests to participate on the album. Dan-e-o wants all of you to be involved every step of the way!

What are those contests we speak of?  

This is where things get really interesting! Dan-e-o welcomes emcees to visit http://dearhiphop.com to download the original “Dear Hip Hop” instrumental so that they can record their own guest verses for inclusion in new 2016 incarnations of the classic track! With YOUR help, Dan-e-o will choose his favourite verses and feature them on the Dear Hip Hop: 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition album.

As well, producers are encouraged to visit http://dearhiphop.com and download the “Dear Hip Hop” a capella so that they can create the own original remixes to the song. With YOUR help, Dan-e-o will choose his favourite beat to create an exclusive new cut for the album!

Finally, for all those who aren't emcees or producers, but still want to voice what hip-hop means to them, we welcome you all to visit http://dearhiphop.com and write a letter to hip-hop that you can share on Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook, with the hashtag #dearhiphop. 

What we need and what you get...

As you know, we need the necessary funding to make this all happen! But what do you get out of the whole deal?

You will receive such perks as early editions of the ""Dear Hip Hop: 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition"" album, private parties with performances from Dan-e-o himself, tickets to shows on his tour, exclusive merchandising to crowd-funders only, your name in the documentary’s credits (all crowdfunders included) and much more. Let’s not forget that you will play an integral role in making history by helping Dan-e-o to complete these celebratory projects!

If the entire goal isn't met, Dan-e-o and his team will do everything they can to work with what they have. Obviously, the more funding we receive, the better the projects will be. Of course, something will always be better than (an advance from a major record label) nothing!

Every contribution counts, from $1.00 to $10,000.00! From one share of this campaign to 100 shares of the campaign. It all helps. 

Side note...
You can donate any amount by typing in the amount under ""Your Contribution"" just above the perks. 

It’s the Dan-e-o album every fan has ever wanted to hear!

If you've ever said to yourself, “I'd like to hear Dan-e-o on a track with _____”, this is the greatest chance to get that to happen! With a classic track like “Dear Hip Hop” celebrating its 20th year of existence, Dan-e-o has proven that the best emcees in the game are the ones who enjoy longevity. Meanwhile, Dan-e-o feels like he’s just getting started! 

Now you can contribute to the next phase of his career in the strongest way possible. By donating straight into the artist’s hands, the artist can create exactly what you want!

If we're able to raise more than the goal...

As mentioned, the projects will only get better! Basically, the amazing features that we have suggested in the perks can only be achieved if you really want them. The project can only go as far as YOU take it.

Where the money goes...

    Features - Even big name artists need to pay other big names to feature on their tracks. Estimated at ($2,000.00+).
    Recording - (4 days of recording x $250 a day = $1,000)
    Mixing/Mastering - (Roughly $100 - $200 a track) Estimated at 14 tracks = Low $1,500.00 Highest (Best quality) = $2,000.00
    Merchandising (Shirts, Hats, Sweaters, Bobbleheads, etc...) We estimate around $5,000-$10,000.00 in merchandising needed.
    Marketing/Videos is estimated at around $10,000-$25,000.00 (3 Videos)
    Advertising is estimated to be at $1,500.00 min.
    Album duplication will need a start of $2,500-10,000.00 to reach the retail stores we'd like to reach.
    Publicist - min of $1,500.00 to start.

<p>Hello, my name is Eric Ott, and am putting out a solo record.</p>
<p>My friends and I started recording this a while ago. I
have been blessed with these fine musicians/friends and other great players on
this project. I have purchased equipment, hired full-time pro musicians etc. I
have realized, in order to properly release this and not max out yet another
credit card, I need to sell some records/bundles to help finance the rest of
this record.</p><p>We still need to Mix, Master and Print. Your pre-order will help us get to the finish line!</p>
<p>The Record: The record is called “In Lieu of Flowers”.
The record is a huge departure from my other records. It has a common theme,
death, and the songs are intertwined with each other. It is somewhat of a
concept record. There are songs with huge production/arraignments and
multi-layered vocals.  I set out to put
out a record that was a little strange but still accessible.</p>
<p>If you pre-order, you will have the record the same time
publishers/reviewers will have it. We will not release this record to the
public until 1 month after the press has it. </p>
<p>Check out the special packages (bundles) we have put together
and help us reach our goal. Thank you so much for reading this.</p>
