Development & Manufacturing

We started with the idea of a neck wearable camera that could capture both videos and photos allowing to share the footage instantly.  We launched and successfully crowdfunded a production campaign on IndieGoGo.
Internally on the hardware, we upgraded to the premier video processing chipset for fast speed and HD wireless processing.  The multitude of features we deployed in the ParaShoot hardware and software are currently not available in any other product of the same size, versatility of use and build quality.  We successfully completed the manufacturing of the ParaShoot HD Luck.  Join the ParaShoot community today!

</h3>
<p>SMI “ Smart Interphone Project ” is the one I'm going to talk about briefly.</p>
<p>My campaign started with the idea to invent a “ Smart ” connection between intercoms and smartphones or tablets.<br/></p>
<p>This system will give us the choice to be able to answer the intercom from any location, at any moment during the day, without being at home.</p>
<p>In the future we won't need normal intercoms, just smart ones.</p> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p></p>

</div></div>","Hello everyone, I'm Fabio and I'm a 27 year old electrical engineering technician; what will interest You the most, is that I have a consuming passion in creating and designing new projects.

SMI “ Smart Interphone Project ” is the one I'm going to talk about briefly.
My campaign started with the idea to invent a “ Smart ” connection between intercoms and smartphones or tablets.
This system will give us the choice to be able to answer the intercom from any location, at any moment during the day, without being at home.
In the future we won't need normal intercoms, just smart ones.   What We Need & What You Get 
The initial funding to carry on this project is 100.000 euros.
Firstly part of it will be spent in commercial and electrical research: in our case we will need professional and highly qualified electrical engineers and marketing experts.
Secondly our team will provide working products in order to start the distribution to our best backers and future customers.
You will be able to choose different kind of exciting features, each of them will allow You to be part of our family and contribute with the realization of this futuristic project (many rewards are waiting for You all!).
In case we won' t reach our goal, the funding will not be wasted, our determination will lead us to take advantage of any amount of money to bring the project on.   The Impact

<p><b>FAQ</b></p>
<p><b>1.<span> 
</span></b><b>Why are you developing this product?</b></p>
<p>Every
year we buy Billions of Electronic devices; so many that we now have more
devices in use than people.  The more we
buy, the more we throw away! By the billions, with devastating impact to the
environment...  In 2010, US disposed some
2.5 million tons of electronic devices, and only 649 thousand tons were
recycled.</p>
<p>A
Cisco survey predicts 50 billion Devices in use by 2020 that is almost 7
devices/person; leading to a prediction of more than 10 million Tons of
electronic waste to be generated in US alone.</p>
<p>Why
Do we throw away so much so quickly:</p>
<p><b>First,
there is no Convergence:</b>  We have too many devices per person with
overlapping or duplicated features– differentiated by form factors and
software,– idle or underutilized Most of the time</p>
<p><b>Second,
devices break by design,</b> and nearly impossible to repair or upgrade; simply
opening a device can cause damage and void warranty!</p>
<p><b>Third,
devices run out of needed capacity</b> or require new step of hardware, go out of fashion or
style</p>
<p><b>And

FAQ
1. 
Why are you developing this product?
Every
year we buy Billions of Electronic devices; so many that we now have more
devices in use than people.  The more we
buy, the more we throw away! By the billions, with devastating impact to the
environment...  In 2010, US disposed some
2.5 million tons of electronic devices, and only 649 thousand tons were
recycled.
A
Cisco survey predicts 50 billion Devices in use by 2020 that is almost 7
devices/person; leading to a prediction of more than 10 million Tons of
electronic waste to be generated in US alone.
Why
Do we throw away so much so quickly:
First,
there is no Convergence:  We have too many devices per person with
overlapping or duplicated features– differentiated by form factors and
software,– idle or underutilized Most of the time
Second,
devices break by design, and nearly impossible to repair or upgrade; simply
opening a device can cause damage and void warranty!
Third,
devices run out of needed capacity or require new step of hardware, go out of fashion or
style
And
lastly as with PCs, our devices cannot support new or popular
features, like touch input, and fall behind and must be updated with new
innovative designs
New products must be more modular and designed to last longer as
Dave Hakkens envisions with “Phonebloks”.
In his Ubuntu Edge campaign video Mark Shuttleworth stated that
“Convergence is the future of computing”
Modular and flexible design and convergence must happen to reduce
waste created by duplication and incompatibility of hardware and software, and
short life span of products.
2. 
Why should
I care?
Everyone that owns or plans to own electronic devices should
care about their personal impact to the environment, as well as frequency of
electronic device purchases due to design. 
“You Are” who the products are designed for and how you respond guides
the industry!
3. 
When will
LUCAN™Companion PC be available?
We are planning to ship no later than September 2014, however
can significantly pull that date in depending on the amount of funds
raised.  The more orders we have, the
bigger message we send to the industry and able to negotiate better terms with
manufacturing partners
4. 
What OS
will the device support?
All of our products will be designed and tested to be open

Android and Windows 8.  These products
will have Android and Ubuntu as default. 
We are setting up a couple of stretch goals.  If we hit the stretch goals, the products

5. 
Will it
have a battery?
Although we are planning for these products to be stationary,
in front of a computer or monitor, we are planning to include optional
batteries.  Exact specs TBD.
6. 
I like to
type on keyboard and do not like the feel of typing on glass, what options do I
have?
Our goal is to develop a product that lasts a long time,
reduces e-waste and duplication. Keyboards have been around for a very long
time and are among the top e-waste producers. 
We are looking at a couple of tactile feedback options: 
- 
A new and unique technology similar to what Tactus
technology is offering (http://www.tactustechnology.com/technology.html)
buttons appear and disappear as magic on touch screen.
- 
Overlays similar to what touchfire offers (http://www.touchfire.com/)
Both of these require for us to hit our stretch goal!
7. 
How is LUCAN™Companion PC different than other tablets in the
market?
Lucan Companion PC is 
a unique product and it is designed to slow down the premature dumping
of PCs that lack touch capabilities. 
However, we did not want to just develop a simple Keyboard or input

This super Tough is high tech awesomeness!




Synapses  is an Italian startup born to create everything we want that doesn’t already exist today. 
We strongly believe in our work ethos. So much so, in fact, that we put it into our slogan: Synapses Technology at the Service of Creativity.
Our prototypes are designed, developed and manufactured entirely in Italy within the Synapse_Lab - 99% accompanied by a good slice of pizza or cup of coffee, in an exceptionally cool, relaxed environment.
We travel a lot, and so our Macbooks and their cases have become a part of us.


… the problem ...


One disappointment, however, is if we plug in the MagSafe Power Supply and it doesn’t work because the power cord is broken, split or frayed. This results in lost time while Andrea and Francesco, our HW specialists, fix it.





We were fed up with buying new cables each year, spending more than $80 each time.One morning, however, our designer Domenico woke up with the idea of using a spring to solve the problem. 






It seemed almost too simple, but we all started working on this new idea and bit by bit, IVY started to grow.

… the solution






IVY stops us from wasting money on new cables. As a bonus, it helps people to look after the planet by reducing the number of broken and discarded MagSafes.
We’re now ready to share our solution with the world - but for that we need your help.

Making Ivy


As you can see, the manufacturing procedure is low impact compared to that of a plastic tool.
IVY is 100% recyclable, as it’s made with iron. 

Technology
IVY is a tool designed to displace the cable’s stress point by spreading it over a greater area. 


Since the first prototype was produced, significant improvements have been made to both the materials used and the installation time.





Installation
 IVY can be installed in less than a minute without the use of any tools.


Design

It's minimalist in design, consisting of only one piece of metal with a smooth surface and no branding, which fits snugly around the cable. We wanted to keep it simple, and focus on functionality. On the other hand, though, we are Italian, so we love design and personalising our tools. IVY is therefore available in four different colours:

<p>We liked the traditional wearable &amp; e-textile platforms, but we are frustrating with the main drawback they have: the using of conductive thread!

<p>So we spent several months to develop a cable suitable for textiles. The cable should be very thin, soft like thread, low-resistance and insulated! It’s a challenging task, we overcame many difficulties and successfully produced our own cables finally.</p>

</div></div>","Update: Most of KeKePad modules are washable, some sensitive modules like the UV sensor, color sensor are nonwashable, but KeKePad is plug-and-play design, so it's easy to take them off! 

PS: We announce that all contributors back more than $80 in this campaign will be our permanent member and will get at least 10~20% Discount in future buying of all KeKePad modules! 


Instead of using conductive thread, it uses super thin & flexible Ke cables to connect the tiny modules together. 
By using KeKePad, you can embed electronics into clothing easily and build cool and creative projects in minutes.

 
 




 

We liked the traditional wearable & e-textile platforms, but we are frustrating with the main drawback they have: the using of conductive thread! Conductive thread is easy to get short circuit and always involves too much sewing and soldering works!
 

So we spent several months to develop a cable suitable for textiles. The cable should be very thin, soft like thread, low-resistance and insulated! It’s a challenging task, we overcame many difficulties and successfully produced our own cables finally.
Ke cable is almost the thinnest cable (wire OD is only 0.32mm, with crimp terminals) in the world. It has multi-strands copper core with Teflon insulation, it’s smooth, strong and flexible like thread. The cable wire is so thin that laser technology must be used in production.


KeKePad is plug-and-play design, by using KeKePad, it’s very easy to build electronics into clothing, no conductive thread, no soldering, little sewing and many annoying tools can be threw away!



A lady said that she was trying to find some thin, flexible and coated wires to make a necklace with beads and LEDs, but she failed!
A student told us that the fabric of his project burned some holes because the conductive thread was crossed, and it almost caused a fire accident!
 
A reporter said: “ KeKePad is very original and it’s a step in the right direction in making wearable components more like textiles.”
 
A STEM educator told us: ""KeKePad’s wiring system and plug-and-play design is very beginner-friendly! KeKePad is wonderful, I love it""!

 

Built-in USB support, use Arduino IDE for programming, compatible with the existing Arduino sketches. Pre-burned with Arduino Lilypad USB bootloader;


 
All the modules use standard 3-pin Ke connector (polarized) interface;The whole platform has a second system of interface: the sew-tab pins (with hole diameter:1.4mm) for wiring; So it’s compatible with other wearable modules using conductive thread.
 
Robust gold plating finish, corrosion prevention. The modules are tiny, round shape, no sharp points, safe for wearing. 


 
 
 
The connector height is only 3.1mm, as thin as a micro-USB; it's 1/7 the size of a typical 3-pin JST connector.The cable wire is super thin but strong; Its resistance is only 1/40 of the stainless steel conductive thread!  
12 Ke connector ports and 11 sew-tab pins provide abundant I/O interfaces. 
There are 12 functional pins (D7,D10,D6,D9,D12,D5,D11; A5,A8,A3,A4,A2) together with USART, I2C and SPI interface for all kinds of applications.

<p><b>Below is our project description as it was while our campaign was still active:</b></p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/></span><p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">You know how everyone and their Grandmother has a paper printer?  Well, wouldn't it be cool if everyone and their Grandmother had a 3D printer?  It definitely would, but this isn't a reality for 2 reasons:</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">- 3D Printers still quite expensive.</span></p>
<p>- They aren't very simple.  Good luck teaching your Grandma how to use one!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The first goal of this project is simple, but bold…</p>
<p>We want to lower the cost and difficulty of 3D Printing to a point where it's accessible to the masses.  We want the 3D Printer to become a household item.  We want 3D printing to become a common part of life.  We want you to have the choice: Should I buy it or should I make it?</p>
<p>With a Peachy Printer (scanner) on your desk, you can choose to make it.  This is the world's most affordable 3D printer!</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">And our second goal...</span></p>
<p>We want to run our business on a set of specific moral principles, some of these are:</p>
<p>- Using Freedom Respecting and Open Source software and hardware. We will NEVER close our source! We will never betray our community!</p>

<p>As you can see the peachy is already working great! We know we can make it do WAY better which brings us to our reasons for using crowd-sourced funding:</p>
<p>- We need money to invest in improving the product, specifically the software end.</p>
<p>- We need to make high volume orders of our parts to keep costs low.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>How does the Peachy Printer work? </p>
<p>Below is a detailed video explaining how the Peachy Printer works through explanation and demonstration!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe height=""435"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/80HsW4HmUes?feature=oembed"" width=""580""></iframe></div><br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p>How it works video transcript:</p>
<p>""The peachy printer is a Photolithographic printer. That means it uses a controlled beam of light to cure light sensitive resin into hard objects. The peachy moves a laser beam along the X and Y axes to create the shape of the object, while using a drip system to control the level of the resin on the Z axis which determines the height of the object.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>The object you want to print must first become a 3D model in Blender. The software we wrote as an add on to blender takes the data from that 3D model and translates it into an audio waveform. It then plays the audio file out to the printer through the headphone jack in your computer. This waveform drives a pair of electro magnetic mirrors. The higher the volume, the higher the voltage, the more the mirrors move. The purpose of these mirrors is to reflect and control the path of the laser beam. By using the audio waveform generated from the 3D model data to drive the mirrors, we are able to get the laser beam to draw out the shape of the object. That's takes care of the X and Y axes.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Now let's talk about the drip system that creates movement on the Z axis. The salt water in the top container syphons down to a drip feed. The rate of this drip feed is controlled by a valve. As each drip leaves the feed, it passes through two contact points creating an electrical connection that is detected by your computers microphone jack. The drip continues to fall into the bottom container where it causes the resin floating atop it to rise. The software listens to the microphone level, counting each drip that falls and calculates the resultant level of the resin. This allows the software to send the layer that corresponds with the current Z-level of the resin. This process continues until the print is complete!""</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Under The Hood</p>
<p>Below are some detailed pictures showing under the hood of our current prototype.  This is the exact hardware that made every print pictured and shown in the videos. Everything we do will be open source hardware, and unlike some companies we will NEVER close our source. </p>

During the R&amp;D process we have been cutting our housings out of MDF instead of plastic to save on expenses.</span></p>

<p style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">If you've seen our main video then you already know just how well these new methods work. This extremely unique design has resulted in a very affordable product, however there are many challenges we must overcome to utilize the overwhelmingly high resolution of the Z-level drip system and todays sound cards. We are very confident in our ability to overcome these challenges and develop a great final product!</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>How does the 3D Scanner work?</p>
<p>When combined with a camera, the Peachy Printer also functions as a 3D scanner! The Peachy repeats a back and forth laser pattern that simulates a line laser. This illuminates the profile of the object you are scanning. Your video camera, webcam, or DSLR will capture this happening while you rotate the object a full 360 degrees. The software we wrote in Blender then searches through each pixel in every frame looking for the point where the laser is hitting the object. Next it calculates the distance of those pixels from the objects rotational centre and plots the points and mesh accordingly in 3D space. You now have a 3D model of the real life object you scanned.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We're even working on a feature that creates a texture map from the footage and applies it to the 3D models mesh automatically. This gives you a even more realistic looking 3D model.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""><br/></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">More About Blender</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Blender is 3D modelling and animation software.  It is freedom respecting, open source and available to download at no cost from <a href=""http://www.blender.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Blender's website</a>.  Blender is central to the software side of this project.  All the software that runs the printer will do so from within Blender.  Since Blender can import many file types this actually leaves you free to use practically any CAD program to create your models.  The blender add ons we write will be capable of running many different printers, not just the Peachy.  One unique feature our add on will have is real time processing.  This will enable you to model as the printer prints!  You will be able to make changes to any part of your model that hasn't been printed yet!</span><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>You may be wondering… What is our plan when it comes to fulfilling the orders if our campaign is successful?  We have 2 different manufacturing plans:</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Manufacturing Plan #1 - Under 5000 orders</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We will start by taking two months to continue with R&amp;D. We will be improving the software, hardware, and finalizing the overall design of the product.</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">After the R&amp;D process is complete we will start manufacturing the printers on our own CNC routers. We are planning on milling the outer housing, mirror assembly, laser holster, and the coil holsters all out of polycarbonate first-surface mirror (vacuum coated with aluminum) which we have already completed successfully.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/63298/files/20130909115503-router.JPG?1378752903"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p></p>
<p>Manufacturing our mirror assemblies on the CNC router</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We also have multiple suppliers in mind - most of which we have already used - for specific parts such as the custom wire coils, earth magnets, and the laser.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Pre-assembled models will be built here in Canada and each one will go through quality control at the end of our assembly line. We will likely have each printer draw out a grid in a dark room. A camera will capture the entire pattern in one image using a long exposure. If the printer is sufficiently capable of drawing an accurate grid, then that grid will be used in a calibration feedback loop for the individual printer that produced it. Not only is this a quality check, it also calibrates your printer to account for any tiny anomalies specific to it. You will receive the test photo and clear instructions on how to perform a re-calibration if you wish to do so.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Manufacturing Plan #2 - Over 5000 Orders</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>We will start by taking two months to continue with R&amp;D. We will be improving the software, hardware, and finalizing the overall design of the product.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>After the R&amp;D process is complete we will get many of the parts that we are currently producing on CNC routers made with injection moulding instead. This manufacturing process ensures that each printer will be produced to more precise specifications and will be our go to choice if we get enough orders.</p>

<p>David Boe - Owner, Investor, Business Manager</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">David is a 38 year old certified Heavy Duty mechanic who is currently employed by Edmonton Kenworth in Fort McMurray, Alberta.  He is also a certified Automotive mechanic and has been “twisting wrenches” on and off for around 20 years.  In between those times, he has owned two small businesses, which taught him a lot, and aligned him with his entrepreneurial spirit.  He has also worked in the insurance industry for a number of years.  Having committed himself to lifelong learning and since one of his main interests is in manufacturing, he started training in the Six Sigma/Lean manufacturing process a couple of years ago after having read numerous books and articles on the subject.  He has also read books and articles on the “Theory of Constraints” logic to manufacturing and found them both to be interesting.</span><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>Dave and Rylan met in mid 2012 and instantly hit it off.  They were very interested in each other's ideas and it didn't take long before they were in business together.  Over the past year they have been working together to get the Peachy Printer to where it's at today.</p>

<p>Nathan Grayston - Advertising &amp; Marketing</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Nathan is a 21 year old entrepreneur living in Yorkton, SK.  He owns a business specializing in video production and graphic design.  He started creating videos and designs at a young age and began doing it professionally 2 years ago.  </span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Nathan is a very passionate and dedicated young man…  No stranger to online fundraising campaigns, in 2012 he was a key member of the volunteer team that won the top prize in the Aviva Community Fund bringing in $150,000 for a new skateboard park in Yorkton.  In total, the group raised $350,000 and saw the park come to completion in under a year.  </span><br/></p>

<p><br/></p>
<p>Josh Ellis - Owner and inventor of MakerJuice</p>
<p>Josh is a 28 year old engineer residing in Kansas City, MO.  A lot like Rylan he has been taking things apart, and putting them back together from a young age.  As he grew older he became interested in computers and programming.  These passions led him to attend a mechanical and electrical engineering course at Louisiana State University.  After his time at LSU, he served in the U.S. Airforce for 4 years.  He now holds down a career doing R&amp;D on A.I. Traffic Control Systems for an engineering firm.  </p>
<p>Josh has been extremely interested in 3D printing as a hobby for years.  After building his own CNC router from scratch and playing around with a RepRap, he started looking into stereolithographic printing.  After doing some searching he was disheartened by the price of resins, and the lack of customer service from the providers.  With a goal of providing the 3D printing community with a high quality, reasonably priced product, he started looking into making his own resin.  After 6 months of testing out formulas and talking to suppliers he launched MakerJuice with 1 formula.  Since then he has been continuously developing new resins and now has 4 products available.</p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Josh has been crucial to the development of the Peachy Printer.  His highly sensitive resins have played a key part in attaining our goal of selling the Peachy for $100.  We are currently in communication with Josh, and we will be working with him to develop a special resin formula just for the Peachy Printer.</span><br/></p>

<p> Risks and challenges</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>1. The Peachy Printer isn't at the final product stage. As described above the Peachy still needs work to reach it's full potential. Some issues and challenges may arise during this process. However, we are extremely confident in our teams ability to rise above them and deliver a great final product. We've already overcame countless roadblocks to get to this point, and we will continue to use the same out-of-the-box solution based thinking process to take it all the way.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>2. The Peachy Printer currently has no set limit on build volume, however we haven't given this adequate testing. Like the beam of a flashlight, the print volume gets larger over distance. We plan to push the boundaries of the Peachy to see just how big we can print... One of our goals is to print a full size (16') canoe!</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>3. Creating the revenue required to develop and progress open source software can be a challenge. We dont currently plan on charging money directly for software that you can clearly copy, modify and redistribute yourself. So how will we raise funds to continue developing our software? We plan to implement a donation system that runs inside the software. You will have the option to donate small amounts towards the development of specific features by clicking ""donate"" buttons right in the program. This idea was recommended by Richard Stallman of the free software foundation. All the money raised through this system will go directly to software development.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>FAQ</b></p>
<p></p>
<p><span>What is included in the Peachy Printer Kit and what tools/materials do I need to complete it?</span></p>
<br/><p>The kit comes with all the unique parts (the printer housing, internal components, and drip system) required to assemble the Peachy Printer.  All that you will need to purchase on your end is two liquid reservoirs for the resin and saltwater, a print base (anything with a flat top that can sit inside the bottom reservoir and be removed), and a way to mount the reservoirs so one is above the other (we recommend a pipe or shelf).  With the current design the only required tools to assemble the printer include a utility knife, and a small screw driver.  We intend to keep this as simple as possible, no special tools will be required.</p>
<p>For reservoirs you can use almost anything that can hold liquid, disposable cups, pop bottle bottoms, aquariums, or if you want to print something larger a rain barrel could be used. Basically the options are endless and depend on how large of an object you are planning on printing.  Keep in mind that build volumes of such a size have not yet been tested.</p>
<br/><p>What is the difference between the $90 early bird kit, and the $100 kits you currently have available?</p>
<br/><p>There is no difference between the two kits other than price, we apologize for the confusion using the words ""everything you need"", the $90 kit will also require you get your own reservoirs and mounting system, same as the $100 kit (See question 1 for more details).</p>
<br/><p>There is some concern about the legality of lasers in different countries, how are you planning on dealing with this?</p>
<br/><p>At this point we are confident we will be able to overcome any of these concerns, if needed we will add an external current limiting resistor so the laser will pass any laws in your country. We are not even sure this is going to be an issue as the laser is being used within the Peachy Printer and not as a laser pointer.</p>
<br/><p>Why are you running a Kickstarter and an Indiegogo campaign at the same time?</p>
<br/><p>Sorry this has caused some confusion!  The reason we launched this on both sites at the same time is because the two sites have different communities (Indiegogo is worldwide) and we want to get the Peachy Printer in as many homes as possible.  The Indiegogo campaign is not a clone, or a scam.  They were both launched on the same day.  The life of the project is not dependent upon both campaigns being successful as at the time of writing this, we have over seven times our fundraising goal on Kickstarter and can easily pull both campaigns off with those funds.</p>
<br/><p>How do I order resin and the printer?</p>
<br/><p>We are currently working with Kickstarter to find a solution to this issue.  Please be patient, we will issue an update when everything is figured out.</p>
<br/><p>What is the build volume of The Peachy Printer?</p>
<br/><p>This build volume of the Peachy Printer is extremely flexible and would depend on the reservoir being used, as mentioned above almost anything can be used as a reservoir. We think that the limiting factor when it comes to how large of an object can be printed will be time, we should be able to scale up a build to any size, its just a matter of how long you are willing to wait for the object to print.  That being said, we haven’t done adequate build volume testing as of yet.</p>
<br/><p>Does surface tension of the resin have any negative effects on the print quality?</p>
<br/><p>MakerJuice is one of the thinnest resins yet!  Although it’s not consistent yet, the Peachy has performed prints where there is absolutely no issue of surface tension and the artifacts that come with it. Josh is working on an even thinner resin specifically formulated for the Peachy and this will reduce surface tension even further. </p>
<br/><p>What is the difference between the resin being sold on your Kickstarter page, and the resin being sold on the MakerJuice website?</p>
<br/><p>MakerJuice was developed for printers that have adhesion problems due to UV light shining through a window (the resin cures to the window).  The Peachy doesn't have this issue so we have one less constraint in the recipe of our Peachy resin.  This is very liberating, allowing us to work with Josh to create a uniquely high quality resin just for the Peachy Printer.  Having said that MakerJuice is what we’ve been using this whole time and it works great too!  We totally support your purchase of it, and it does work with the peachy!</p>
<br/><p>How is the Peachy Printer powered?</p>

Below is our project description as it was while our campaign was still active:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You know how everyone and their Grandmother has a paper printer?  Well, wouldn't it be cool if everyone and their Grandmother had a 3D printer?  It definitely would, but this isn't a reality for 2 reasons:

- 3D Printers still quite expensive.
- They aren't very simple.  Good luck teaching your Grandma how to use one!

The first goal of this project is simple, but bold…
We want to lower the cost and difficulty of 3D Printing to a point where it's accessible to the masses.  We want the 3D Printer to become a household item.  We want 3D printing to become a common part of life.  We want you to have the choice: Should I buy it or should I make it?
With a Peachy Printer (scanner) on your desk, you can choose to make it.  This is the world's most affordable 3D printer!
And our second goal...
We want to run our business on a set of specific moral principles, some of these are:
- Using Freedom Respecting and Open Source software and hardware. We will NEVER close our source! We will never betray our community!
- Being outspoken and informative about the political and ethical ramifications of 3D printing technology.
- Informing customers of safe practices when using our product and providing proper safety equipment.
As you've seen from watching our main video, we've already got this little printer working pretty good.  Every object in that video, and pictured below was done with the pre-production prototype featured in the ""How it Works"" video below!







Hollow Cube - Estimated resin cost - $0.02
Solid Cube - Estimated resin cost - $0.10



Dave! - Estimated resin cost - $0.50



As you can see the peachy is already working great! We know we can make it do WAY better which brings us to our reasons for using crowd-sourced funding:
- We need money to invest in improving the product, specifically the software end.
- We need to make high volume orders of our parts to keep costs low.

How does the Peachy Printer work? 
Below is a detailed video explaining how the Peachy Printer works through explanation and demonstration!



How it works video transcript:
""The peachy printer is a Photolithographic printer. That means it uses a controlled beam of light to cure light sensitive resin into hard objects. The peachy moves a laser beam along the X and Y axes to create the shape of the object, while using a drip system to control the level of the resin on the Z axis which determines the height of the object.

The object you want to print must first become a 3D model in Blender. The software we wrote as an add on to blender takes the data from that 3D model and translates it into an audio waveform. It then plays the audio file out to the printer through the headphone jack in your computer. This waveform drives a pair of electro magnetic mirrors. The higher the volume, the higher the voltage, the more the mirrors move. The purpose of these mirrors is to reflect and control the path of the laser beam. By using the audio waveform generated from the 3D model data to drive the mirrors, we are able to get the laser beam to draw out the shape of the object. That's takes care of the X and Y axes.

Now let's talk about the drip system that creates movement on the Z axis. The salt water in the top container syphons down to a drip feed. The rate of this drip feed is controlled by a valve. As each drip leaves the feed, it passes through two contact points creating an electrical connection that is detected by your computers microphone jack. The drip continues to fall into the bottom container where it causes the resin floating atop it to rise. The software listens to the microphone level, counting each drip that falls and calculates the resultant level of the resin. This allows the software to send the layer that corresponds with the current Z-level of the resin. This process continues until the print is complete!""

Under The Hood
Below are some detailed pictures showing under the hood of our current prototype.  This is the exact hardware that made every print pictured and shown in the videos. Everything we do will be open source hardware, and unlike some companies we will NEVER close our source. 


A few separate parts, as well as the fully built printer. During the R&D process we have been cutting our housings out of MDF instead of plastic to save on expenses.


Here you can see one of the mirrors that moves and directs the laser beam.
In this image you can clearly see the electro-magnet assembly that moves the mirrors.
If you've seen our main video then you already know just how well these new methods work. This extremely unique design has resulted in a very affordable product, however there are many challenges we must overcome to utilize the overwhelmingly high resolution of the Z-level drip system and todays sound cards. We are very confident in our ability to overcome these challenges and develop a great final product!



How does the 3D Scanner work?
When combined with a camera, the Peachy Printer also functions as a 3D scanner! The Peachy repeats a back and forth laser pattern that simulates a line laser. This illuminates the profile of the object you are scanning. Your video camera, webcam, or DSLR will capture this happening while you rotate the object a full 360 degrees. The software we wrote in Blender then searches through each pixel in every frame looking for the point where the laser is hitting the object. Next it calculates the distance of those pixels from the objects rotational centre and plots the points and mesh accordingly in 3D space. You now have a 3D model of the real life object you scanned.
We're even working on a feature that creates a texture map from the footage and applies it to the 3D models mesh automatically. This gives you a even more realistic looking 3D model.

More About Blender
Blender is 3D modelling and animation software.  It is freedom respecting, open source and available to download at no cost from Blender's website.  Blender is central to the software side of this project.  All the software that runs the printer will do so from within Blender.  Since Blender can import many file types this actually leaves you free to use practically any CAD program to create your models.  The blender add ons we write will be capable of running many different printers, not just the Peachy.  One unique feature our add on will have is real time processing.  This will enable you to model as the printer prints!  You will be able to make changes to any part of your model that hasn't been printed yet!

You may be wondering… What is our plan when it comes to fulfilling the orders if our campaign is successful?  We have 2 different manufacturing plans:
Manufacturing Plan #1 - Under 5000 orders
We will start by taking two months to continue with R&D. We will be improving the software, hardware, and finalizing the overall design of the product.
After the R&D process is complete we will start manufacturing the printers on our own CNC routers. We are planning on milling the outer housing, mirror assembly, laser holster, and the coil holsters all out of polycarbonate first-surface mirror (vacuum coated with aluminum) which we have already completed successfully.






Manufacturing our mirror assemblies on the CNC router

We also have multiple suppliers in mind - most of which we have already used - for specific parts such as the custom wire coils, earth magnets, and the laser.

Pre-assembled models will be built here in Canada and each one will go through quality control at the end of our assembly line. We will likely have each printer draw out a grid in a dark room. A camera will capture the entire pattern in one image using a long exposure. If the printer is sufficiently capable of drawing an accurate grid, then that grid will be used in a calibration feedback loop for the individual printer that produced it. Not only is this a quality check, it also calibrates your printer to account for any tiny anomalies specific to it. You will receive the test photo and clear instructions on how to perform a re-calibration if you wish to do so.

Manufacturing Plan #2 - Over 5000 Orders

We will start by taking two months to continue with R&D. We will be improving the software, hardware, and finalizing the overall design of the product.

After the R&D process is complete we will get many of the parts that we are currently producing on CNC routers made with injection moulding instead. This manufacturing process ensures that each printer will be produced to more precise specifications and will be our go to choice if we get enough orders.

David Boe - Owner, Investor, Business Manager
David is a 38 year old certified Heavy Duty mechanic who is currently employed by Edmonton Kenworth in Fort McMurray, Alberta.  He is also a certified Automotive mechanic and has been “twisting wrenches” on and off for around 20 years.  In between those times, he has owned two small businesses, which taught him a lot, and aligned him with his entrepreneurial spirit.  He has also worked in the insurance industry for a number of years.  Having committed himself to lifelong learning and since one of his main interests is in manufacturing, he started training in the Six Sigma/Lean manufacturing process a couple of years ago after having read numerous books and articles on the subject.  He has also read books and articles on the “Theory of Constraints” logic to manufacturing and found them both to be interesting.

Dave and Rylan met in mid 2012 and instantly hit it off.  They were very interested in each other's ideas and it didn't take long before they were in business together.  Over the past year they have been working together to get the Peachy Printer to where it's at today.

Nathan Grayston - Advertising & Marketing
Nathan is a 21 year old entrepreneur living in Yorkton, SK.  He owns a business specializing in video production and graphic design.  He started creating videos and designs at a young age and began doing it professionally 2 years ago.  
Nathan is a very passionate and dedicated young man…  No stranger to online fundraising campaigns, in 2012 he was a key member of the volunteer team that won the top prize in the Aviva Community Fund bringing in $150,000 for a new skateboard park in Yorkton.  In total, the group raised $350,000 and saw the park come to completion in under a year.  
Much like his role in that project, at Peachy Printer he's currently in charge of video production, graphic design, web design, marketing and advertising.    

Josh Ellis - Owner and inventor of MakerJuice
Josh is a 28 year old engineer residing in Kansas City, MO.  A lot like Rylan he has been taking things apart, and putting them back together from a young age.  As he grew older he became interested in computers and programming.  These passions led him to attend a mechanical and electrical engineering course at Louisiana State University.  After his time at LSU, he served in the U.S. Airforce for 4 years.  He now holds down a career doing R&D on A.I. Traffic Control Systems for an engineering firm.  
Josh has been extremely interested in 3D printing as a hobby for years.  After building his own CNC router from scratch and playing around with a RepRap, he started looking into stereolithographic printing.  After doing some searching he was disheartened by the price of resins, and the lack of customer service from the providers.  With a goal of providing the 3D printing community with a high quality, reasonably priced product, he started looking into making his own resin.  After 6 months of testing out formulas and talking to suppliers he launched MakerJuice with 1 formula.  Since then he has been continuously developing new resins and now has 4 products available.
Josh has been crucial to the development of the Peachy Printer.  His highly sensitive resins have played a key part in attaining our goal of selling the Peachy for $100.  We are currently in communication with Josh, and we will be working with him to develop a special resin formula just for the Peachy Printer.

 Risks and challenges

1. The Peachy Printer isn't at the final product stage. As described above the Peachy still needs work to reach it's full potential. Some issues and challenges may arise during this process. However, we are extremely confident in our teams ability to rise above them and deliver a great final product. We've already overcame countless roadblocks to get to this point, and we will continue to use the same out-of-the-box solution based thinking process to take it all the way.

2. The Peachy Printer currently has no set limit on build volume, however we haven't given this adequate testing. Like the beam of a flashlight, the print volume gets larger over distance. We plan to push the boundaries of the Peachy to see just how big we can print... One of our goals is to print a full size (16') canoe!

3. Creating the revenue required to develop and progress open source software can be a challenge. We dont currently plan on charging money directly for software that you can clearly copy, modify and redistribute yourself. So how will we raise funds to continue developing our software? We plan to implement a donation system that runs inside the software. You will have the option to donate small amounts towards the development of specific features by clicking ""donate"" buttons right in the program. This idea was recommended by Richard Stallman of the free software foundation. All the money raised through this system will go directly to software development.

FAQ

What is included in the Peachy Printer Kit and what tools/materials do I need to complete it?
The kit comes with all the unique parts (the printer housing, internal components, and drip system) required to assemble the Peachy Printer.  All that you will need to purchase on your end is two liquid reservoirs for the resin and saltwater, a print base (anything with a flat top that can sit inside the bottom reservoir and be removed), and a way to mount the reservoirs so one is above the other (we recommend a pipe or shelf).  With the current design the only required tools to assemble the printer include a utility knife, and a small screw driver.  We intend to keep this as simple as possible, no special tools will be required.
For reservoirs you can use almost anything that can hold liquid, disposable cups, pop bottle bottoms, aquariums, or if you want to print something larger a rain barrel could be used. Basically the options are endless and depend on how large of an object you are planning on printing.  Keep in mind that build volumes of such a size have not yet been tested.
What is the difference between the $90 early bird kit, and the $100 kits you currently have available?
There is no difference between the two kits other than price, we apologize for the confusion using the words ""everything you need"", the $90 kit will also require you get your own reservoirs and mounting system, same as the $100 kit (See question 1 for more details).
There is some concern about the legality of lasers in different countries, how are you planning on dealing with this?
At this point we are confident we will be able to overcome any of these concerns, if needed we will add an external current limiting resistor so the laser will pass any laws in your country. We are not even sure this is going to be an issue as the laser is being used within the Peachy Printer and not as a laser pointer.
Why are you running a Kickstarter and an Indiegogo campaign at the same time?
Sorry this has caused some confusion!  The reason we launched this on both sites at the same time is because the two sites have different communities (Indiegogo is worldwide) and we want to get the Peachy Printer in as many homes as possible.  The Indiegogo campaign is not a clone, or a scam.  They were both launched on the same day.  The life of the project is not dependent upon both campaigns being successful as at the time of writing this, we have over seven times our fundraising goal on Kickstarter and can easily pull both campaigns off with those funds.
How do I order resin and the printer?
We are currently working with Kickstarter to find a solution to this issue.  Please be patient, we will issue an update when everything is figured out.
What is the build volume of The Peachy Printer?
This build volume of the Peachy Printer is extremely flexible and would depend on the reservoir being used, as mentioned above almost anything can be used as a reservoir. We think that the limiting factor when it comes to how large of an object can be printed will be time, we should be able to scale up a build to any size, its just a matter of how long you are willing to wait for the object to print.  That being said, we haven’t done adequate build volume testing as of yet.
Does surface tension of the resin have any negative effects on the print quality?
MakerJuice is one of the thinnest resins yet!  Although it’s not consistent yet, the Peachy has performed prints where there is absolutely no issue of surface tension and the artifacts that come with it. Josh is working on an even thinner resin specifically formulated for the Peachy and this will reduce surface tension even further. 
What is the difference between the resin being sold on your Kickstarter page, and the resin being sold on the MakerJuice website?
MakerJuice was developed for printers that have adhesion problems due to UV light shining through a window (the resin cures to the window).  The Peachy doesn't have this issue so we have one less constraint in the recipe of our Peachy resin.  This is very liberating, allowing us to work with Josh to create a uniquely high quality resin just for the Peachy Printer.  Having said that MakerJuice is what we’ve been using this whole time and it works great too!  We totally support your purchase of it, and it does work with the peachy!
How is the Peachy Printer powered?
The Peachy Printer is powered by the USB and headphone jacks alone.  There is no external adapter, no wall power!  The Peachy is built to be hacked so you could easily modify it to be powered with a battery or a solar panel.
Will you be doing any complex print demonstrations?
We have done some more complex prints in the past but we did them with a really early version of the software and they didn’t turn out too well.  They don’t represent what the Peachy will be able to do, but you can check some of them out in the gallery section of our website.  We like pushing the limits, if we decide to do more prints during the campaign we will attempt to print a both a full size canoe and a working peachy printer (think reprap!)  These prints would have an extremely positive effect on the campaign!  Even if we fail, at least we will have taken some of the guess work out for our backers!  For now we are completely swamped with the media and backer questions.  If you're not convinced by what you have seen so far then feel free to wait it out, we will prove the full capabilities of the Peachy as soon as we can!
What about floating objects?
Great news!  Floating objects only need very, very small support tabs/legs.  This is because the print and the salt water have almost identical densities.  Also, unlike an extrusion based printer there is no print head to put physical pressure on the print.
Is the resin open source too?
Not yet, although it has been talked about.  This will be up to Josh Ellis from MakerJuice.
Does the scanner attachment include a printer?
No.  It’s basically quality camera and a turntable (driven by a stepper motor) that combine with the printer to make it a scanner.  If you prefer, you can use your own camera and turntable along with the Peachy kit to have scanner functionality.
Do you require a print base, or does the object just float as it prints?
You need a print base, but nearly anything will work!
What is the toxicity of the resin, is it food safe?
We don’t know the final recipe for the resin yet as its still under development!  Please assume that its not food safe… We will work hard to pleasantly surprise you!
Will there be a reward for a kit version that includes everything that the fully assembled version does?
Yes, we're currently discussing that option.  Stay tuned!
Does the shrinkage of the curing resin have an effect on or compound errors with the Z-axis precision?
Absolutely, however much of this effect is consistent and predictable.  For the most part it can be calibrated for.
What kind of pipe will I need and what exactly is it for?
The purpose of the pipe is to mount on liquid container above the other. You can use anything you see fit (pipe, rod, dowel, shelves etc.).  Just make sure it’s strong enough!

What are the specs of the new resins: Flex and Wiggle?
While they are functional, these resins are still in development and the specs will change.  Therefore we can’t give any detailed information about them.  
Can you mix the different resins together to get new flexibility properties?
Yes!  These new resins are mixable.  This will allow you to create a range of resins with different flexibility properties.
Are the PeachyJuice Resins different from the MakerJuice Resins?
Yes!  We are working with Josh Ellis of MakerJuice to create resins specifically formulated to work best with the Peachy Printer.
Will Flex and Wiggle be available in all the colours?
Yes!  Both of our new resins will be available in all the colours.",10.0,1,"1 Campaign

<hr/><h2><strong>To our supporters and email followers: </strong></h2>
<p>It’s time for an update, and what an update we have for you this time. Obviously our fundraising goal here on Indiegogo was not met; but we still have three pieces of big exciting news to share with you, and our supporters will still receive rewards (more on that in a minute).<br/><br/><strong>1 </strong><br/> Our team, particularly Mark and Josh, have worked really hard on making media contacts and getting intelliPaper out there. Their hard work has been successful—we’ve had dozens of articles in outlets like <a href=""http://news.discovery.com/tech/intellipaper-121206.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Discovery.com</a> (the Discovery Channel’s website), <a href=""http://www.ubergizmo.com/2012/11/intellipaper-usb-paper-drive"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Ubergizmo.com</a>, <a href=""http://thenextweb.com/gadgets/2012/12/04/intellipaper-adds-a-disposable-usb-drive-to-your-business-card-flyer-or-brochure/?fromcat=all"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">TheNextWeb.com</a> and a bunch more.<br/><br/> We’ve also made contact with specific reporters and shipped sample packs to Mashable.com, the Wall Street Journal, Forbes.com, ABC news, and USA Today. We were able to make contact with people there because of the media exposure we’ve had so far. So thanks, reporters! And a big public thank-you to Mark and Josh. Joan, our executive assistant and bookkeeper, hardly has time to figure out whether she’s coming or going because the phone is ringing off the hook these days. <br/><br/><strong>2</strong><br/> Not only has our media exposure started to reach critical mass, but we’re in the middle of another big developments too! We recently inked an agreement with a U.S. distributor. That takes some of the logistical work off of Andrew so he can focus more on developing cool new intelliPaper products. If you're in the promotional space, you'll want to visit the <a href=""%22https:/www.intellipaper.info/products-page/the-order-process/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">intelliPaper store online</a> and get in touch with one of our awesome sales reps.<br/><br/><strong>3</strong><br/> Notwithstanding the fact we did not meet our funding goal, we are still planning to release consumer-oriented product (DataNotes™) mid next year. We’re pretty excited about where we are going and about the awesome feedback we got from the public as part of this project.<br/><br/><strong>Your Rewards!</strong><br/> We noticed that by far most of the interest people have expressed in intelliPaper products has been centered on DataNotes™, not on the greeting cards as we’d originally thought would be the case. Hindsight is 20/20, but current data is even better. Given our new strategic direction and its financial demands, we need to substitute DataNotes™ for the greeting card rewards. <br/><br/> We think you’ll be pretty excited about what you can do with DataNotes™. Once you receive them, don’t forget to write us and let us know what you think about them. At this point we plan on maintaining the delivery schedule as explained in the project. Your feedback is really important. Seriously. Important. So thanks in advance for letting us know how things go.<br/><br/> If you ordered greeting cards, and don't want DataNotes™ instead, we'll gladly refund your contribution. Just let us know. We will be contacting each contributor individually after the holidays so stay tuned.</p>

</h4><p>2)Dead batteries. Let's face it, most of us stream from our phones and it really sucks the juice.</p><p>3)Drop outs due to calls. Just cos' I'm on the phone doesn't mean my tunes are on hold!</p><p>4)Bluetooth
 connections. Let's face it, Bluetooth is 'AM' compared to WiFi ;-). 
I've walked behind a wall so I lose my connection? Huh? I'm trying to 
stream via Bluetooth at a party but it drops out sue to too many 
signals? Huh?</p><p>5)Lack of control. We want to be able to use our
 phone or computer but we don't want to HAVE to use them. And we 
certaqinly don't want them to be the powerhouse. How about being able to
 control our speakers .... from our speakers!</p><p>6)Flexibility. We 
want multiple USB's, Flash Drive storage, DLNA and Airplay compatible so
 that we can access our computers' music library remotely, HDMI to turn 
our dumb TV smart or add a projector, 2 AUX's, SD card. In short we want
 to be able to play any music, any way.</p><p>7)Save our phone data. Streaming really sucks the data and we've all forgotten to switch to home WiFi.</p><p>8)Being dictated to. We want open source software and we want to be able to browse the web, not be told what app we can play!<br/></p><p>9)Boring.
 How long has it been since something really nailed it as a streaming 
solution? Let's face it, the current options don't work! The GUNN 
StreamTower is exciting in design, concept and looks, a joy to show your
 friends and fun to use.</p><p>10)No complicated software. Simply plug and play. Download the remote app from the App store and you are in business.</p><h4>Never Fear! GUNN is Here.....</h4><h4>We began building the SX series out of frustration. Why weren't the other manufacturers getting it right? It was so obvious that their solutions don't work.<br/>
</h4><h4>So we started with outcomes and worked backwards. And the answer is quite 
simple. Take an awesome new cabinet design and make sure it broadcasts truly world class sound quality. Add Android and 
WiFi. Come up with an ingenious remote app that's  never been done 
before...... and you've got yourself a StreamTower!<br/>
</h4><p>(It's a bit harder than that :-)</p><p>GUNN SX 
speakers have built-in WiFi and a touch-screen. 
Simply connect them wirelessly to your home router and stream your music
 from your favourite app or site.<br/></p><p></p><h3></h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/238423/files/20131202213609-Revised-GUNN-SX-Diagram.jpg?1386048969"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><b>The way it should be: </b></p><p><b>Style
 over function? Function over style? Sound quality above all? Many a 
head has been scratched over these weighty questions. Fortunately the 
GUNN SX smart speakers deliver. The best quality sound is broadcast from wooden cabinets. A pair of 100k speakers will be made from wood. It's dense yet porus to deliver thick, rich sound at low volumes and quality tunes at high volume due to the weight of the housing.  <br/></b></p><p><b><br/></b></p><h3><b><b>The
 sound quality is on par with MUCH more expensive systems from the 
engineered, hand made wooden cabinets. </b></b></h3><p></p><p><b>We believe in powered speakers so
 our amplifier is hidden away in the subwoofer and the
 clever touch screen recesses into the speaker housing on a specially 
designed bracket. So all you see is speakers; beautiful speakers. No 
trekky, techy knobs and flashing lights. Just sleek, streamlined audio 
heaven. The way it should be.</b></p><h3></h3><p><b><b>Connectivity – check!<br/>Looks – check!<br/>Concept – awesome!<br/>But what do they sound like and how do they perform?</b></b></p><p><b>At
 GUNN Audio we've never been about small sound systems. We believe that 
the best sound is broadcast from well designed, heavy, quality built 
wooden housing. All GUNN systems are hand-made from wood and designed 
for maximum impact and sound quality. </b></p><p><b>We also believe that 
multiple black boxes cluttering up our rooms is a thing of the past. Our
 speakers are powered, meaning that all you see (and communicate with) 
is the speakers themselves. No external amps, tuners, docks ... 
anything! </b></p><p><b><b>The Speakers:</b></b></p><p><b>We decided to spend our time
 looking for existing speaker manufacturers to team up with rather than recreate the wheel. 
GUNN had agents all over the world looking for the best quality, best 
sounding speakers, for the best price. This took over 6 months and 
countless train trips, countless samples, countless rejections of those 
samples and countless sleepless nights. We found many bad speakers, we 
found a few good ones, but we wanted great, incredible, unbelievable. We
 wanted passion from our factory. A passion for sound. A passion for 
striving to be better and to offer more.</b></p><p><b>Eventually we found them! </b></p><p><b>The
 GUNN SX smart speakers produce a sound quality on par with much, MUCH 
more expensive systems. In short, they sound bloody amazing.</b></p><p><b>Our 
high-end speaker manufacturer has been in the game for years. We set out to design the amazing StreamTower together. The GUNN

<p><b>FAQ:</b></p>
<p>1) Will you offer synchronised streaming?</p>
<p>Yes,
 we are working on that technology and it will be available in 2014. The
 system we are working on is to use one GUNN SX unit to be a 'lead unit'
 for other GUNN SX systems. This, again, eliminates the need for an 
external device. It will be a simple upgrade to the existing systems. </p>
<p>2) Will we introduce Airplay into our speakers?Our
 speakers have DLNA. There are many apps that will convert Airplay to 
DLNA. Apple licensing is expensive and we aim to keep our prices down 
and our quality up....... but we will include it if the dema</p></span><br/></div>","10 things we hate about streaming music.........1)Bad quality tunes. When we stream from our phone or computer we lose quality. We want the ability to play (high quality) at the highest bit rate
2)Dead batteries. Let's face it, most of us stream from our phones and it really sucks the juice.3)Drop outs due to calls. Just cos' I'm on the phone doesn't mean my tunes are on hold!4)Bluetooth
 connections. Let's face it, Bluetooth is 'AM' compared to WiFi ;-). 
I've walked behind a wall so I lose my connection? Huh? I'm trying to 
stream via Bluetooth at a party but it drops out sue to too many 
signals? Huh?5)Lack of control. We want to be able to use our
 phone or computer but we don't want to HAVE to use them. And we 
certaqinly don't want them to be the powerhouse. How about being able to
 control our speakers .... from our speakers!6)Flexibility. We 
want multiple USB's, Flash Drive storage, DLNA and Airplay compatible so
 that we can access our computers' music library remotely, HDMI to turn 
our dumb TV smart or add a projector, 2 AUX's, SD card. In short we want
 to be able to play any music, any way.7)Save our phone data. Streaming really sucks the data and we've all forgotten to switch to home WiFi.8)Being dictated to. We want open source software and we want to be able to browse the web, not be told what app we can play!9)Boring.
 How long has it been since something really nailed it as a streaming 
solution? Let's face it, the current options don't work! The GUNN 
StreamTower is exciting in design, concept and looks, a joy to show your
 friends and fun to use.10)No complicated software. Simply plug and play. Download the remote app from the App store and you are in business.Never Fear! GUNN is Here.....We began building the SX series out of frustration. Why weren't the other manufacturers getting it right? It was so obvious that their solutions don't work.
So we started with outcomes and worked backwards. And the answer is quite 
simple. Take an awesome new cabinet design and make sure it broadcasts truly world class sound quality. Add Android and 
WiFi. Come up with an ingenious remote app that's  never been done 
before...... and you've got yourself a StreamTower!
(It's a bit harder than that :-)GUNN SX 
speakers have built-in WiFi and a touch-screen. 
Simply connect them wirelessly to your home router and stream your music
 from your favourite app or site.The way it should be: Style
 over function? Function over style? Sound quality above all? Many a 
head has been scratched over these weighty questions. Fortunately the 
GUNN SX smart speakers deliver. The best quality sound is broadcast from wooden cabinets. A pair of 100k speakers will be made from wood. It's dense yet porus to deliver thick, rich sound at low volumes and quality tunes at high volume due to the weight of the housing.  The
 sound quality is on par with MUCH more expensive systems from the 
engineered, hand made wooden cabinets. We believe in powered speakers so
 our amplifier is hidden away in the subwoofer and the
 clever touch screen recesses into the speaker housing on a specially 
designed bracket. So all you see is speakers; beautiful speakers. No 
trekky, techy knobs and flashing lights. Just sleek, streamlined audio 
heaven. The way it should be.Connectivity – check!Looks – check!Concept – awesome!But what do they sound like and how do they perform?At
 GUNN Audio we've never been about small sound systems. We believe that 
the best sound is broadcast from well designed, heavy, quality built 
wooden housing. All GUNN systems are hand-made from wood and designed 
for maximum impact and sound quality. We also believe that 
multiple black boxes cluttering up our rooms is a thing of the past. Our
 speakers are powered, meaning that all you see (and communicate with) 
is the speakers themselves. No external amps, tuners, docks ... 
anything! The Speakers:We decided to spend our time
 looking for existing speaker manufacturers to team up with rather than recreate the wheel. 
GUNN had agents all over the world looking for the best quality, best 
sounding speakers, for the best price. This took over 6 months and 
countless train trips, countless samples, countless rejections of those 
samples and countless sleepless nights. We found many bad speakers, we 
found a few good ones, but we wanted great, incredible, unbelievable. We
 wanted passion from our factory. A passion for sound. A passion for 
striving to be better and to offer more.Eventually we found them! The
 GUNN SX smart speakers produce a sound quality on par with much, MUCH 
more expensive systems. In short, they sound bloody amazing.Our 
high-end speaker manufacturer has been in the game for years. We set out to design the amazing StreamTower together. The GUNN 
operating system has been built into their existing speaker designs for the rest of the range, 
which has saved us a lot of time and money. We are passing these savings
 on to you.The Technology:Our engineers designed 
the GUNN system to be the best in the world. Our team has worked on some
 of the biggest projects for THE biggest companies. We are talking world
 leaders here. And they have built the best music streaming system 
available in the GUNN SX series. Our Android system and user interface 
to brings you an intuitive, reliable and beautiful operating system. So
 you can rest assured the GUNN SX range are excellent quality, ultra

It is basically a 3D visor (HMD - Head Mounted Display) with stereoscopic capabilities.What does it do ?
It converts your tablet/smartphone into a fully fledged, completely mobile, Home Cinema.
It can be used to watch all the video content your own in a completely new and exciting way.  You don't need to have specific SBS beforehand. You can play ANY video, as it is.

It can also be used as a remote, wireless monitor for your computer, thus opening the way for remote gaming and various virtual reality applications. 

How do you use it ?
You slide your tablet or smartphone into your adapter. 
You open your media-player with SBS capabilities and play content.
How does it work ?
It works for video the same way headphones do for audio. It brings the content to you, in a natural way.
Humans have binocular vision. This means that each eye is receiving reflected light from the surrounding world. The two images are combined by the brain into a single video feed.

Our adapter works in the same way. It converts the content (movies, videos, games, etc.) into a side-by-side stream that is displayed on your tablet or smartphone.
If the two side-by-side images are offset, you will also experience the depth of the objects, thus real 3D.
The Viiwok Deva has two specially designed lenses that magnify the mobile device's display, without any quality loss, so that the user can watch desired content in a natural, comfortable way.Technical features and specifications

It's made of polycarbonate. This means it's very lightweight, durable and has a smooth, pleasant touch. (our prototype, although fully functional, has been 3D printed in PLA plastic, thus its somewhat rough appearance)
The design will be miles better compared to the prototype. We have extremelly skilled designers which are working as we speak in order to bring you best in class ergonomics and looks. 
It will come in 4 colors, depending on your preference (white, black, red and blue).

It uses 2"" in diameter, custom made, aspheric lenses, for best focusing and magnifying capabilities.
Adjustable IPD (Inter Pupillary Distance) and focal length (distance from eyes to display) for a natural and comfortable experience, without headaches and eye strain.
Integrated, discrete headtracking sensors for motion detection - you can use our product in order to stream and play your favourite PC games***. No special drivers needed.

 



The Impact
This product has the potential of becoming a paradigm shift for the
entertainment and general media sectors.
Not only it can completely eliminate the need for a TV, but it can save you
tremendous amounts of money in the future.
The image quality is astounding. Watching movies or playing games through
the Deva is like being 3 feet away from a 80” plasma display. The experience is incredible. It’s like having your own Home Cinema,
completely mobile, at a fraction of the cost, and future proof.

You no

Instead of paying thousands for the latest TV set which will keep you stuck in your living room for hours, the Viiwok 3Deva is truly refreshing and liberating. You already have your movies, clips and films on your tablet, so why shouldn't you watch them as they were intended in the first place ?

We have a patent pending on the design and have existing relationships with suppliers for the components. We've invested all of our own funds so far to develop the 2nd prototype. We need $50,000 to complete engineering & software development to have HeadsUP! ready for mass production. We have taken this as far as we can on our own, and now we need YOUR help to make this product a reality.

</div></div>","Messy Tangled Cables?

 
In this era of mobile devices, it can be a problem to effectively charge them so they are ready to go when you are. We all suffer from too many tangled cables and not enough charging ports, forcing us to charge different devices in different places. XONE solves this problem and provides the perfect solution for charging your essential devices.
 
 

 

 
 

 
 Apple Fans? 
Power up your Apple Watch, Airpods and iPhone at the same time. XONE is the perfect place to keep your favorite Apple gear while safely charging them simultaneously.
 

 
 Supports Multiple Devices: 
XONE can charge up to 3 devices all at once. It’s a convenient place to keep all your devices that dispenses with the mess of cables and solves the problem of limited USB sockets.
 

 
XONE is compatible with all Qi-compatible devices using magnetic-induction technology: 
 

 
 

 

 

 
Removable Watch Stand
 

 
No Apple Watch? Nevermind! Let XONE help you!
The removable watch stand could be replaced with light or fan.
 
Bladeless Fan
 

 
 Led Light

 

 

 
  
 

 
You can simply place your Qi-supported device on the charging dock and it automatically starts charging at up to 10W speed. Life is simple, and tangled cables become a thing of the past.
 

 
XONE adopts a high-quality copper coil with built-in temperature sensing probe. When the charging temperature is too high, XONE will automatically reduce the current output. It prevents battery overheating to protect your valuable devices at all times.
 

 
  
 

 

 

 

 

 
With a sleek design, XONE makes an attractive complement to any desk or home. It efficiently handles all your smart device charging needs with a modern sense of style. Its minimalistic design will perfectly match both work and life.
 
 Charging Indicator Lights:

 

 
Three independent charging indicator lights will alert you if your charger is connected. Its soft illumination creates comfortable mood lighting. XONE also features built-in safety systems including over-current and short circuit protection as well as foreign object detection that will turn off charging to protect you if a metal object is misplaced onto it.
 
 Night Stand Clock Mode:

 

 

 
Sleep soundly and wake up ready and refreshed for your day. XONE keeps your Apple Watch partially visible in nightstand mode while charging your devices for another day on the go.
 
 Anti-slip Base:


 
The anti-slip base will make sure your devices stay safely in place, protecting them from scratches, drops and falls.

<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">That problem had to be
solved, and so we did! We developed a lightweight, small, multifunctional and
pretty adapter: The NiceDice.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Together with the Berliner film
camera equipment rental <i>25p*cine support</i> and photo camera equipment rental
<i>rent one*photo support</i> we investigated the demand of cameramen and

It consists of a basic module -the NiceDice- with two holes and two slots. Both have the diameter of a standard 15mm rod. The NiceDice fits perfectly on the standard rods, while using the second hole to fasten an adapter of choice t our specially designed screw. The innovative slots in the NiceDice make sure that the rod is not only pressed from above and below, but also squeezed from the sides. As there are forces working horizontally and vertically, the fixation of the NiceDice is solid as a rock!</span><br/></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">But what if you want to use
a different adapter? Simply disconnect the adapter from the universal screw and
connect the adapter of your choice. In a blink of an eye you have changed the
solid construction you had before, into a something equally solid, but that
better fits your needs! </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">The doubler-adapter enables you to connect two NiceDice with each other in every angle you can think of. This gives you the freedom to reposition the rods -and resultantly your equipment- as you wish.<i>  </i></span></p>

<h4>NiceDice- basic module</h4>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">All parts of the
NiceDice-System are manufactured in CNC-machines with high precision and are
made from quality aircraft aluminum. A number of producers in Germany have
shown interest in the production of the NiceDice and so we can make sure that
all parts are made in Germany. In that way we ensure high quality, short
communication channels and domestic working places. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">After the production, the
parts will receive its graceful color and robust surface through the process of
anodization. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Quality and usability are
essential for us. And that’s why, after making drafts, scrapping them and redesigning,
we managed to make it possible for you to use the NiceDice-System without any
tools! So you can leave your screwdriver at home, as the system is secure,
stable and can be fixed in place easily.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></span></p>
<h4>The NiceDice adapters</h4>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 1.45em; font-weight: normal;"">To start off, we have placed
our focus on integrating the most important of the existing standards. The
following adapters are already tested and are available:</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Hot Shoe Adapter – male<br/>
Hot Shoe Adapter – female<br/>
Tripod thread 1/4"" – male<br/>
Tripod thread 3/8"" – male<br/>

<p></p>
<p>We are working hard and eagerly to lift the NiceDice to the next level: the open market.</p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We’re almost there! With your support we can afford to start an economically viable first round of production. As we want to personally
contribute to this revolution, your money will NOT be used to compensate
ourselves for the time we spend on this project. The production costs simply
stretch further than we can reach by ourselves and therefore we rely on your
support. Also, the prototypes need a redesign to live up to the feedback we received during the </span>field-tests. </p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">So pledge whatever you can,
as you are given the opportunity to purchase the first NiceDice for a friends' price! </span></p>

den kreativen Prozess. Das gesamte Zubehör kann nicht flexibel eingesetzt
werden, sondern braucht Spezialadapter, um an der Kamera angebracht zu werden.<p></p>
<p>Entwickelt aus
dem wahren Leben von Filmemachern und Fotografen, haben wir einen Adapter
entwickelt, der leicht, klein und flexibel ist und dabei auch noch gut
aussieht: den NiceDice.</p>
<p>In enger
Kooperation mit dem Berliner Filmtechnikverleiher <i>25p *cine support</i> und dem
Fototechnikverleih <i>rent one *photo support</i> haben wir genau auf die Bedürfnisse
der Filmemacher und Fotografen gehört und daraufhin diesen besonderen Adapter
entwickelt, produziert und weiterentwickelt.</p>
<p>Mit dem NiceDice
gehören nun einige Nachteile der Vergangenheit an:</p><p></p><ul>
<li>Schwere Tasche voller Speziallösungen<br/>

<li>Hohe Investitionen, denn viele Spezialadapter kosten in Summe viel Geld<span><br/></span><span><br/></span>

simpel. Es besteht aus einem Grundbaustein – dem NiceDice – mit zwei Löchern
und zwei schicken Schlitzen. Beide Löcher haben einen Durchmesser von einem
Standard 15mm Rohr. Der NiceDice passt daher perfekt auf dieses Standardrohr,
während man durch das zweite Loch den Adapter seiner Wahl mit unserer
Allzweckschraube fixiert. Durch die patentierte Schlitzung des Würfels wird nun
nicht nur ein Klemmdruck, sondern auch eine Verkantung erzeugt, die den Würfel
besonders fest fixiert. Das der Adapter jetzt noch verrutscht ist sehr
unwahrscheinlich. </span><br/></p><p></p>
<p>Brauchst Du
einen anderen Adapter? Dann tausche ihn unkompliziert und einfach gegen einen anderen! Du kannst den NiceDice mit unserem Verdoppler auch mit anderen
NiceDice verbinden. So erhältst Du unendliche Erweiterungs- und
Kombinationsmöglichkeiten.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></p>

<h4>Der NiceDice-Grundbaustein</h4><p>Alle Teile des
NiceDice werden aus einem Block hochwertigem Flugzeug-Aluminium mit computergesteuerten CNC- Maschinen hochpräzise gefräst. Dafür haben wir bereits namhafte Hersteller in Deutschland gewinnen können, die uns
unterstützen. So wird eine hohe Qualität gewährleistet und wir unterstützen
damit gleichzeitig Arbeitsplätze in der Region.</p>
<p>Nach dem Feinschliff bekommt der NiceDice seine exquisite Farbe und seine widerstandsfähige Oberfläche durch ein spezielles Eloxatbad.</p>
<p>Funktion und Qualität
stehen an erster Stelle. Das war uns auch beim Design sehr wichtig. So
haben wir es, nach langem konzipieren, verwerfen und neuentwerfen geschafft den
NiceDice werkzeugfrei einsetzbar zu machen. Den Schraubenzieher kannst Du zu
Hause lassen, denn dank der innovativen Konstruktion ist das System sicher und
stabil und kinderleicht zu fixieren.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></p>
<h4>Die NiceDice Adapter</h4><p>Zum Auftakt
haben wir unseren Fokus darauf gelegt, die wichtigsten der existierenden
Standards zu integrieren. Folgende Adapter sind bereits ausgiebig getestet und

Professional filming with DSLR-cameras - our new system solves incompatibility issues.NiceDice- The Swiss Army Knife for the film and photo industry!
Contribute to our campaign and make it happen! With your support we are ready to start the first production. Delivery is scheduled for the summer of 2014. Spread the word!- Your Andreas, Nils and Ken

The NiceDice is the very
first multifunctional adapter in the field of film- and photo equipment. As we
work in close cooperation with the film equipment rental 25p* cine support, the
development of the NiceDice is steered directly by the demand and wishes of
cameramen and photographers. Our vision states that the equipment of a
cameraman should be subordinate to the creative process instead of the other
way around. With its interchangeable adapters, the NiceDice-System provides the
opportunity to quickly, easily, tools-free and independently react to
situations in the studio, on set or on the streets. The concept won a bunch of awards over the past year:                

Nils,
product designer, is responsible for the pretty design and the amazing
functionality of the NiceDice, as the idea was created at his desk. With over a
decade of experience as an independent film producer and cameraman, Andreas knows our market like no other.
With a degree in cultural sciences and event conception, he makes sure that
everybody gets to know the NiceDice and supports us with further development. With
a degree in economics and business economics, Ken is the one to check, double-check and adjust the financials of
the project.




With the current
NiceDice-System -and some of the additional features we’re working on at this very moment- we want to make a cameraman’s life easier. His tools should look
pretty, should stimulate a creative way of thinking and should, above all,
offer a wide range of functionalities.
The NiceDice is our first
product and with your help we can start to provide tools, that will make
cameramen and photographers worldwide realize that their tackle box is not a
burden, but a first opportunity to let their creativity flow!Whether you are a cameraman
or a photographer, professional or an amateur, on the streets, on a set or in
the studio, you’ll always rely on some special adapter(s). At the end of the day (or
actually, in the middle of the day), there will always be something missing,
like a little screw or an adapter of some sort. These missing parts interrupt
the creative process, as the demanded equipment can’t be used.
That problem had to be
solved, and so we did! We developed a lightweight, small, multifunctional and
pretty adapter: The NiceDice.
Together with the Berliner film
camera equipment rental 25p*cine support and photo camera equipment rental
rent one*photo support we investigated the demand of cameramen and
photographers and thereupon we developed these extraordinary adapters.


The NiceDice-System is simple. It consists of a basic module -the NiceDice- with two holes and two slots. Both have the diameter of a standard 15mm rod. The NiceDice fits perfectly on the standard rods, while using the second hole to fasten an adapter of choice t our specially designed screw. The innovative slots in the NiceDice make sure that the rod is not only pressed from above and below, but also squeezed from the sides. As there are forces working horizontally and vertically, the fixation of the NiceDice is solid as a rock!
But what if you want to use
a different adapter? Simply disconnect the adapter from the universal screw and
connect the adapter of your choice. In a blink of an eye you have changed the
solid construction you had before, into a something equally solid, but that
better fits your needs! 
The doubler-adapter enables you to connect two NiceDice with each other in every angle you can think of. This gives you the freedom to reposition the rods -and resultantly your equipment- as you wish.  

     








Example aplenty. Whilst developing the NiceDice, we had a number of requirements in mind that the NiceDice had to fulfil, such as a double hot shoe mount. During the field tests however, the cameramen displayed their creativity and every single one of them came up with new and interesting ideas! In the end, it turned out that not only almost every existing connection could be made, but also that unknown solutions were created!









NiceDice- basic module
All parts of the
NiceDice-System are manufactured in CNC-machines with high precision and are
made from quality aircraft aluminum. A number of producers in Germany have
shown interest in the production of the NiceDice and so we can make sure that
all parts are made in Germany. In that way we ensure high quality, short
communication channels and domestic working places. 
After the production, the
parts will receive its graceful color and robust surface through the process of
anodization. 
Quality and usability are
essential for us. And that’s why, after making drafts, scrapping them and redesigning,
we managed to make it possible for you to use the NiceDice-System without any
tools! So you can leave your screwdriver at home, as the system is secure,
stable and can be fixed in place easily.
The NiceDice adapters
To start off, we have placed
our focus on integrating the most important of the existing standards. The
following adapters are already tested and are available:
Hot Shoe Adapter – male
Hot Shoe Adapter – female
Tripod thread 1/4"" – male
Tripod thread 3/8"" – male
Doubler, both sides 3/8"" thread - female






We are working hard and eagerly to lift the NiceDice to the next level: the open market.
We’re almost there! With your support we can afford to start an economically viable first round of production. As we want to personally
contribute to this revolution, your money will NOT be used to compensate
ourselves for the time we spend on this project. The production costs simply
stretch further than we can reach by ourselves and therefore we rely on your
support. Also, the prototypes need a redesign to live up to the feedback we received during the field-tests. 
So pledge whatever you can,
as you are given the opportunity to purchase the first NiceDice for a friends' price! 





We put a great deal of effort in putting together the perks. So go ahead and show us some love!

Aside from money, we need
publicity, lots of publicity. Share this campaign with your friends and let
them know what you think about the NiceDice via Facebook, Twitter, smoke
signals or in whatever way you prefer. Help us reach those people, that will
love our idea.

will be delighted to hear your ideas!

Der NiceDice ist der erste Multifunktionsadapter für Kamerazubehör im Bereich
Film- und Fototechnik. In enger Zusammenarbeit mit dem Berliner
Filmtechnikverleih 25p* cine support entstand die Entwicklung des NiceDice
unmittelbar aus den Bedürfnissen von Kameramännern und Fotografen. Die Vision
ist: Die Technik soll sich dem kreativen Handeln des Kameramanns unterordnen und nicht andersherum. Der NiceDice bietet mit seinen austauschbaren
Adaptern genau diese Möglichkeit – auf jede erdenkliche Situation kann schnell,
unkompliziert, werkzeuglos und unabhängig reagiert werden.Das Konzept wurde bereits mehrfach ausgezeichnet:            Für das tolle
Design und die Funktionalität zeichnet Nils verantwortlich.
Aus der Feder des Berliner Produktdesigners stammt der NiceDice. Der seit über
einem Jahrzehnt als unabhängiger Filmproduzent und Kameramann arbeitende Andreas,
kennt unseren Zielmarkt wie kein Zweiter. Als studierter Kulturwissenschaftler
und Eventkonzeptioner lässt er jeden vom NiceDice wissen und unterstützt bei der Produktentwicklung.
Der in Holland studierte Betriebswirt Ken sorgt im Team dafür, dass
die Zahlen stimmen und dass alle finanziellen Entscheidungen wasserdicht und
kugelsicher sind.

Mit dem NiceDice
System wollen wir das Leben der Kameramänner und Fotografen leichter machen. Wir glauben, die Technik sollte immer möglichst vielfältig einsetzbar sein, zu einer kreativen Arbeitsweise anregen und natürlich auch gut aussehen! 
Der NiceDice ist
unser erstes Produkt aus einer Reihe von Ideen, die wir in naher Zukunft entwickeln werden. Mit Eurer Hilfe wollen wir den NiceDice
für alle Wirklichkeit werden zu lassen. Wir wollen weltweit Filmemachern und Fotografen ein
Tool bieten, mit dem sie Ihre Technik nicht mehr als Last, sondern als erste
kreative Aufgabe begreifen, um ihre schöpferische Arbeit umzusetzen.Das unterbricht
den kreativen Prozess. Das gesamte Zubehör kann nicht flexibel eingesetzt
werden, sondern braucht Spezialadapter, um an der Kamera angebracht zu werden.
Entwickelt aus
dem wahren Leben von Filmemachern und Fotografen, haben wir einen Adapter
entwickelt, der leicht, klein und flexibel ist und dabei auch noch gut
aussieht: den NiceDice.
In enger
Kooperation mit dem Berliner Filmtechnikverleiher 25p *cine support und dem
Fototechnikverleih rent one *photo support haben wir genau auf die Bedürfnisse
der Filmemacher und Fotografen gehört und daraufhin diesen besonderen Adapter
entwickelt, produziert und weiterentwickelt.
Mit dem NiceDice
gehören nun einige Nachteile der Vergangenheit an:
Schwere Tasche voller Speziallösungen

Hohe Investitionen, denn viele Spezialadapter kosten in Summe viel Geld


Unser System ist
simpel. Es besteht aus einem Grundbaustein – dem NiceDice – mit zwei Löchern
und zwei schicken Schlitzen. Beide Löcher haben einen Durchmesser von einem
Standard 15mm Rohr. Der NiceDice passt daher perfekt auf dieses Standardrohr,
während man durch das zweite Loch den Adapter seiner Wahl mit unserer
Allzweckschraube fixiert. Durch die patentierte Schlitzung des Würfels wird nun
nicht nur ein Klemmdruck, sondern auch eine Verkantung erzeugt, die den Würfel
besonders fest fixiert. Das der Adapter jetzt noch verrutscht ist sehr
unwahrscheinlich. 
Brauchst Du
einen anderen Adapter? Dann tausche ihn unkompliziert und einfach gegen einen anderen! Du kannst den NiceDice mit unserem Verdoppler auch mit anderen
NiceDice verbinden. So erhältst Du unendliche Erweiterungs- und
Kombinationsmöglichkeiten.
 In der Testphase
haben wir festgestellt, dass die meisten Kameramänner und -frauen gleich neue und ungewöhnliche Ideen für Einsatz des NiceDice
entwickelten. Hier ein Beispiel:


Der NiceDice-GrundbausteinAlle Teile des
NiceDice werden aus einem Block hochwertigem Flugzeug-Aluminium mit computergesteuerten CNC- Maschinen hochpräzise gefräst. Dafür haben wir bereits namhafte Hersteller in Deutschland gewinnen können, die uns
unterstützen. So wird eine hohe Qualität gewährleistet und wir unterstützen
damit gleichzeitig Arbeitsplätze in der Region.
Nach dem Feinschliff bekommt der NiceDice seine exquisite Farbe und seine widerstandsfähige Oberfläche durch ein spezielles Eloxatbad.
Funktion und Qualität
stehen an erster Stelle. Das war uns auch beim Design sehr wichtig. So
haben wir es, nach langem konzipieren, verwerfen und neuentwerfen geschafft den
NiceDice werkzeugfrei einsetzbar zu machen. Den Schraubenzieher kannst Du zu
Hause lassen, denn dank der innovativen Konstruktion ist das System sicher und
stabil und kinderleicht zu fixieren.
Die NiceDice AdapterZum Auftakt
haben wir unseren Fokus darauf gelegt, die wichtigsten der existierenden
Standards zu integrieren. Folgende Adapter sind bereits ausgiebig getestet und
stehen zur Verfügung:
Blitzschuhadapter

3/8“ – maleVerdoppler –

Wir arbeiten
hart daran, den NiceDice zur Serienreife zu überführen.
Alles was uns am
Ende dafür fehlt, ist die Finanzierung für die erste Produktionsserie. Und
genau dafür werden wir Deinen Beitrag einsetzen. Die Kosten für unsere Arbeit werden durch die Kampagne natürlich nicht bezahlt, denn wir glauben an unser Produkt, seinen Nutzen für den Kunden und seinen Erfolg am Markt. Was aber die Kosten für die erste
Produktion angeht, übersteigen diese unseren Rahmen. Neben der Produktion werden wir das Geld für den letzten Schliff am Design einsetzen und ihn in die Produktion überführen.Deshalb vertrauen wir auf
Eure Unterstützung. 
Spende was immer Du kannst, wir sind für alles dankbar.
Bei der Auswahl
der Geschenke haben wir uns viel Mühe gegeben. Besonders freuen würden wir uns
natürlich, wenn Du Dir gleich ein NiceDice Set aussuchst. Es ist tolles
Gefühl, dass der NiceDice so gut bei Dir ankommt, dass Du schon jetzt einen
haben willst. :)*****************

At
spotNsave we wanted to create something that would allow parents, grandparents,
and loved ones to have a peace of mind. Today, we are living in a world where
we dont know what is going to happen next. Safety is a big concern, we all in
our daily lives think about our loved ones whether they are fine or not. 
spotNsave
band is a Bluetooth bracelet worn on your wrist ( android users ) and as a key
chain or neckpiece ( for iOS users ) and with a double click your location is
sent out to your guardian Angels. We have made it very simple for users,
without reaching out their phone they can initiate a SoS and alert your loved
ones so that they can reach on time. 
spotNsave
changes the
definition of security and provides millions of people the opportunity of a
real solution and for the first time, one that is simple yet powerful.How does it work?

Step
one: Download spotNsave from your nearest app store and buy our bracelet from www.spotnsave.com or download spotNsave from the play store                    https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.epicelements.spotnsave

Step
two: Create and activate your account.


Step
three: Choose up to five guardian angels and you’re ready to go!


In any unpleasant situation, with a Double click on the SOS button on the spotNsave
bracelet or Pendant, or a double click on the power button of your phone, spotNsave will
send your guardian angels a text with a link to your location. Your guardian
will receive the fastest route to your location with turn by turn driving
instructions. They can also follow you by real time tracking knowing your exact
location. Automatic notifications are sent to your guardian when your battery
is running low or when you leave network coverage. Location history is an easy
reference for looking later for the most frequent location that you have
visited.Why are
we different?
The Bracelet & Pendant makes it easy to use, fast, and secure.
When
you are in an unpleasant situation all you need to do is double click the
button on your band and your guardian angels will be alerted with your location
and every movement of yours until you cancel the SOS.Just imagine if someone
grabs you, or you fall, your first instinct would be to look for your phone to
inform your loved ones and seek for help, unlike other sos applications, spotNsave
allows you to use the bracelet and pendant without having to look for your
phone. With a double click on the band, notifications will be sent to your
guardians and help will come to you. Help is just a “Double Click “away,
Or if your running out of battery, notifications will still be sent to your
guardians and safety will still be the top priority. Every micro second counts
when you are in an emergency.Ideal For:
Women of any age
Old Age Homes
Construction Sites
For Any individual who wants to feel secure.

<h3>Why Indiegogo</h3>
<p>All of our team members love photography, and we want to make photography much easier. That’s why we create CASE. We want to share this wonderful tool with all photographers, and make it as cheap as possible. Indiegogo community has supported so many great projects. Unlike many big companies, we don't have huge funds to invest. Thanks to our hard working technique developers, we have used the limited funds to finish this CASE prototype. However, we are running out of money and cannot massive produce CASE for photographers. With more backers’ help, we can decrease the cost further and move faster to release plug-in sensors and CASE Pro. For this reason, we hope to build a popular campaign and spread this wonderful device all over the world.</p>

<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>CASE is a solid product. We have demonstrated this with our prototype. However, as with all crowd-funding campaigns, there are risks and challenges:</p><p><b>(a)  Fewer units sold may increase price</b></p><p>We are confident with CASE. After some predictive calculation, we offer CASE at $79. If we can achieve the goal ($15,000), that’s perfect. If not, we will still keep our word even if we lose money. CASE is a wonderful device for photographers, and Cheering Tech is a trustworthy team.</p><p><b>(b)  Supply and production</b></p><p>We have some resources here to support mass production. Our team will preorder key components and prepare for production. We will try our best to make it happen as soon as possible.</p><p><b>(c)  Shipping</b></p><p>We cannot control what will happen during the delivery. We will choose trustworthy shipping company like UPS, FedEx, DHL etc. However, there is still no guarantee that this will work in your country (most country will be no problem). </p>

That's why photography community is so amazing.  A lot of backers ask for hot shoe connection. Here it is:CASE will have one more connection method! Please comment us any idea you think great for CASE. We will carefully think about it. CASE may be the shape just as you want. CASE is a dream of us, and we believe it will also be a dream of photography community. CASE has attracted a lot of press attention. CASE is a solid product, and photographers definitely love it.

Who Are We
Our team is a group of young and innovative people that hold the full patent rights to CASE technology. We have won awards in the Liaoning Province Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition.  Our team features experts in different fields with international education background in the USA, Italy, and China.

Why Indiegogo
All of our team members love photography, and we want to make photography much easier. That’s why we create CASE. We want to share this wonderful tool with all photographers, and make it as cheap as possible. Indiegogo community has supported so many great projects. Unlike many big companies, we don't have huge funds to invest. Thanks to our hard working technique developers, we have used the limited funds to finish this CASE prototype. However, we are running out of money and cannot massive produce CASE for photographers. With more backers’ help, we can decrease the cost further and move faster to release plug-in sensors and CASE Pro. For this reason, we hope to build a popular campaign and spread this wonderful device all over the world.

So help us, join us, and let us make photography much easier!Be the first to get a CASE.Start enjoying easy photography.Your contribution will not only help us, but also decrease the price of CASE to help all others who love this smart device.All funds will be used for mass production and product R&D. We will ship CASE in approximately 3 months.  

Time Line
Indiegogo campaign timeline:

CASE will be well packaged and shipped to you!!!


Stretch Goals

CASE is a smart photography platform with various plug-in smart sensors. In the future, you can order any plug-in sensor to make photography with CASE much easier!We will release two versions of the CASE App: CASE and CASE Pro.  They will be available in Google Play and the Apple Store.CASE and CASE Pro App comparison:

CASE now, enjoy future!Even if we raise no money, CASE development will still strictly follow this schedule:


RewardsUpdated perks!!!Many backers suggest customer engraving service, we hear that. Here it is. You can choose $10 perk to engrave some special words on your CASE. The engraving letters will be on the back side of CASE, and limited in 16 English letters (number is also accepted). You can send the words by email to us. We will take care of the rest.


Risks and Challenges
CASE is a solid product. We have demonstrated this with our prototype. However, as with all crowd-funding campaigns, there are risks and challenges:(a)  Fewer units sold may increase priceWe are confident with CASE. After some predictive calculation, we offer CASE at $79. If we can achieve the goal ($15,000), that’s perfect. If not, we will still keep our word even if we lose money. CASE is a wonderful device for photographers, and Cheering Tech is a trustworthy team.(b)  Supply and productionWe have some resources here to support mass production. Our team will preorder key components and prepare for production. We will try our best to make it happen as soon as possible.(c)  ShippingWe cannot control what will happen during the delivery. We will choose trustworthy shipping company like UPS, FedEx, DHL etc. However, there is still no guarantee that this will work in your country (most country will be no problem).

Panasonic cameras. We will continue to update FAQ

<li>
<strong>It's simple to use.</strong> You simply register at our web site and download a self installing amhCard package.  You configure your payments page(s) and you are ready to begin accepting amhCard.</li>
<li>
<strong>There are no monthly charges</strong> for merchants with less than 500 transactions per month or for any merchants who support us.</li>
<li>
<strong>Catalog and TV sales </strong>no longer require “Operators are standing by”.  Auction vendors don’t need special registration.  You can receive funds directly into your phone.  Its real cash.  You transfer it out of the phone or draw it from an ATM once you receive it.<strong><br/></strong>
</li>
</ul><p><span style=""text-decoration: underline;""><strong>Offline Merchants:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>You can accept mobile payments with your existing terminal.</strong> You simply register, download and install our UPGRADE TERMINAL APP and you are ready to accept amhCard.  </li>
<li>
<strong>You get an automatic terminal upgrade, if your credit card Acquirer is an amhCard partner</strong>.  You instantly become capable of processing amhCard mobile payments.  Your transaction fees will be what you negotiated with your Acquirer.</li>
<li>
<strong>Get the amhCard POS terminal, and pay much lower fees for amhCard mobile payment transactions.</strong> Your terminal will also handle biometric payments, that is a consumer can make a payment with his thumb and index finger.  You will also be able to accept “tap-and-go” amhCard mobile payments.  (Note:  This is a new patent-pending technology that works on any phone, we do not use NFC or bar codes).</li>
</ul><h2><strong>For Consumers</strong></h2>
<p>amhCard is cash on your cell phone or mobile device.  You download the amhCard Mobile Payment App (AMPA) from the amhCard site or Android market.  You then load your phone either online from your bank account or debit card, or offline by paying an amhCard agent. Once your phone is loaded you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buy online and offline. That is you can pay in-store or purchase from Amazon.com with your phone.</li>
<li>Pay <strong>any amount</strong> from 1c to $1,000</li>
<li>Transfer funds to anyone who has a cell phone.</li>
<li>Draw the cash on your phone from an ATM using a special amhCard debit card which we mail to you.  Its linked to the funds on your phone instead of to a bank account.</li>
<li>Remotely unload the cash on your phone, if you loose your phone. You can transfer the unloaded cash to another phone or to a bank account.</li>
<li>See your cash balance in real time after each transaction.</li>
</ul><p><strong>Our technology is novel, and protected by multiple issued and pending patents.</strong> It's not Square. It's not NFC.  It's not SMS.  It's cash on your phone.</p>
<h2><strong>For Acquirers</strong></h2>
<p>With our software, an Acquirer supporter can enable all its merchants to accept amhCard mobile payments with one software upgrade.</p>
<h1><strong>Our Technology<br/></strong></h1>
<p><strong>amhCard has multiple technology innovations undergirding its payment features.</strong> All are patented or patent-pending. We have also implemented robust security functions across every amhCard payment feature to ensure that your cash is very, very safe. </p>
<h1><strong>How we'll use the funds.</strong></h1>
<p>Our prototype only has 3 features and we need to develop the remaining 3, as all 6 need to be present at launch. In addition, because amhCard is a payment product, it is subject to stringent regulation, even for the prototype, so we need robust (read: expensive) infrastructure to meet regulations which include backup, reporting, security, and data retention requirements.</p>
<p>So funds raised will be used to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Complete development of remaining payment modules for the amhCard Mobile Payment App (AMPA), for mobile devices, as well as the complementary modules which run on our back-end systems.  We also need to full QA of both new and existing modules before prototype release.  For example, we have tested our terminal upgrade module on the two most widely used terminals in the US, but need to test on a wider range of terminals. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Purchase additional computer hardware for our “prototype” back-end processing infrastructure that will support a few merchants and about 5,000 users on Android and IOS devices. We will scale out this infrastructure to support up to 30 million consumers for production. A cloud infrastructure solution though cheaper than building our own, has PCI DSS constraints that make it unsuitable for storing payment data.</p>
</li>
</ul><p>We will distribute our full featured prototype to our supporters in March 2013 and go live in May 2013.  </p>
<h1><strong>THE FUTURE.</strong></h1>
<p>Big banks, payments providers, and several deep pocket entities are all pursuing mobile payments but they currently lack the technology and deployment strategy, though they expect to develop this 2 to 3 years in the future.  We have both, the technology and the strategy.  Here. Now. </p>

<h3><strong>MiFunnel Real Estate Sales Forecasting App Summary</strong></h3>
<p>Many real estate agents in the real estate business today are running their businesses blind and may one day go broke, if they do not <strong>start</strong> <strong>tracking</strong> and <strong>plotting</strong> the critical sales metrics that would help them become successful business owners.</p>
<p><strong>Enter stage right.</strong> The MiFunnel Real Estate Sales Forecasting App is an aspiring, simple iphone app that would help Real Estate Agents keep track of their future and pending sales activity.</p>
<h3><strong>Funding is for:</strong></h3>
<p>Design of the logo; development of the app itself which includes wireframing, design mock-ups, creative assets, and programming. This inculdes creative copy for a splash page, the ad copy within the app store and subsequent screen shots.</p>
<p><strong>Soup to Nuts:</strong> You would be supporting us from start to finish and essentially help us get our product to market.</p>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
If you are a real estate agent reading this, I bet you can imagine sitting at an open house or in-between appointments calculating your monthly commissions in your head and trying to figure out what you absolutely must do for the day, week or month so that your transactions and deals successfully get to the closing table. But, you might not have your lap top with you, but I know you will at the very least have your cell phone on you. Our goal is to make it easier for you to conduct your business in the field. Everything is going mobile right? <strong>Why not mobile sales forecasting?</strong>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Imagine how easy it could be to have an all in one app to set reminders about transactions. Imagine getting a call from a hot lead on the road and never having to lose the name, phone number, email address of hot lead ever again. Imagine knowing how much money you are going to make per deal and how much you have to set aside for taxes without having to sit through and do messy commission calculations! UGH!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Stop the madness and start thinking like a business owner.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Let's face it agents and other business owners alike. Business is mobile and we need mobile soltuions to keep up with the pace (life, ugh I mean real estate sales.)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Get the word out and make some noise about our campaign. We appreciate contributions, facebook updates, tweets, and just about anything else that might help us reach our fundraising goal inside of 45 days or less.</p>
<h3>If you are not in the real estate industry, why should you care?</h3>
<p>Sometimes its fun to get behind cool projects and show your support. If you have a friend, relative or former co-worker that is in the real estate industry, you should know that they need tools to keep them on track and productive. This is one of the ones you might want to suggest to them. (:-)</p>
<p>Plus, our company is about paying it forward and we intend to give back a percentage of our proceeds to causes that help the real estate industry like foreclosure prevention or counseling; down-payment assistance for buyers; college scholarship for Agents with children and other positive causes to raise awaresness about the challenges both agents and consumers face in today's economy. Or maybe you know Angie Perez personally and want to support her cause. Either way, we'd be happy to have your support in any which way you can lend a hand. Thanks again for your support.</p>

Tanzania and Zambia. They are beautiful, fast and the strongest among the
existing members of the antelope family. Known for excellent survival
instincts, Puku survives in extremely wet or dry weather conditions. They also
live in high altitudes when escaping floods.</p>
<p>We feel
deeply connected to these attributes of Puku which we have integrated in the
Puku design and brand. Our mission is to ensure that everyone has the freedom
to charge where they are using high quality and high performance portable
chargers with beautiful and superior design attributes in a class of its own.</p>

 No two people are the same, and neither are their power needs. That's why Puku comes in three different sizes, to match your lifestyle.

Space in your bag or pockets is precious. Puku Spark was built with this in mind. Though it may be small (less than 4 inches long) the Puku Spark packs a 6000mAh battery capable of fully charging your smart phone 2 to 3 times. With that much power, you'll get over 24 hours of extra talk time and over 104 hours of music and movies.Whether you're trying to make it uptown on the subway or make it across the ocean on a 747, you're not always going to be able to find a power outlet. The Puku Flash stores a high capacity 8000mAh battery in a package smaller than a pack of cigarettes. With 8000mAh of battery life, you can fully power most smartphones 3 to 5 times, giving you over 36 hours of extra talk time and over 153 hours of music or video playback. 

Sometimes you just need more power. With the Puku Bolt we've done something incredible by putting a huge 12000mAh battery in a beautiful device that is smaller than most smartphones. Puku Bolt has enough power to completely recharge most tablets, or fully charge most smartphones up to 6 times, giving you an incredible 50+ hours of talk time, and over 210 hours of music or video playback. With the Puku Bolt, you'll never run out of power again.









Puku is the perfect accessory for any smartphone, tablet, or other USB charged device, keeping your favorite device charged and ready for any situation. The minimalist curved design and soft touch matte finish allows you to look great and feel great while you stay charged.




With Puku's dual USB ports, you can charge two devices at once from it's high capacity lithium-ion battery. Puku's batteries can go through over 500 charge cycles before beginning to wear out.






Puku comes with a signature micro-USB cable with American Wire Gauge (AWG) Standard 28/24, ideal for high speed conductivity. This cable charges the Puku unit and Android devices approximately 1.8x faster than the typical 28/28 USB cable.

Can I choose the color of my cables?
No, each Puku package comes standard with a micro
USB cable and lightning short cord.  The
color of the lightning short cord matches the color of your preferred
Puku.  FYI the Camo print Puku’s are
matched with a cool gray lightning short cord.

What
does Puku mean?
Puku is a
breed of antelope found in the savanna grasslands of central Africa mostly in
Tanzania and Zambia. They are beautiful, fast and the strongest among the
existing members of the antelope family. Known for excellent survival
instincts, Puku survives in extremely wet or dry weather conditions. They also
live in high altitudes when escaping floods.
We feel
deeply connected to these attributes of Puku which we have integrated in the
Puku design and brand. Our mission is to ensure that everyone has the freedom
to charge where they are using high quality and high performance portable
chargers with beautiful and superior design attributes in a class of its own.
What
is included in a single Puku package?

Each Puku package includes the following:
Puku Bolt – Charger, 2.1 Amp Socket, Micro USB
Cable, Lightning Short Cord, Carry Bag and a User’s Manual
Puku Flash – Charger, 2.1 Amp Socket, Micro USB
Cable, Lightning Short Cord, Carry Bag and a User’s Manual
Puku Spark – Charger, Micro USB Cable,
Lightning Short Cord, Carry Bag and a User’s Manual


How
do I charge my Puku?
You can charge your Puku with the included charger or a
compatible USB charger for your local outlets. The Puku charger comes with a
USB cable which has a micro-USB connector and a wall charger. Charge your Puku
by connecting it to the wall charger via the micro-USB connector.Depending on the Puku model, it takes 3-6 hours to fully charge the Puku. 
Please note that the Puku Spark does not come with a wall
socket.  The device can be charged from
any USB wall socket or laptop.  The Puku
Flash and Puku Bolt both have sockets that can be used for charging.
How
do I know how much battery life is left on my Puku?
The Puku comes with a battery level indicator that displays
different colors depending on the charge level of your Puku. White: 71-100%,
Orange: 35-70%, Red: 11-34%, Flashing Red: 0-10%

Can
I charge my Puku from the wall while charging my device with the Puku?
Yes
How
do I know my Puku is fully charged?
The flashing indicator becomes a solid white color once your
Puku device is fully charged.",26.0,2,"1 Campaign

</div>","Get your ""Free limited edition Duet""We are extending ‘Free Limited Color Edition Black Duets’ to our Indiegogo campaign backers and will ship it to you by End-September. Please use the sharing tools above to enjoy the benefits. We will publish all referral results by the end of our campaign. We will be prototyping and creating a new ‘Gold’ Duet for our top 3 Duet ambassador. Exclusively to him only. Terms and conditions apply.
*This is the extension of our $107,127 campaign*
We are absolutely blown away by the overwhelming response in our first Duet campaign (see it here:http://bit.ly/1haEhPN). What started out originally as an idea to validate if people would get a Duet to prevent phone loss, became a $107,127 project! After the campaign closed, we had several requests from people who wanted an extension in order to order Duet.  We mulled hard over these decision, and so here's the GOOD NEWS.  The Duet Team has decided to extend the campaign to make Duet available again to more people!*Shipping Updates*Due to lessons learnt in our previous campaign, Duets ordered in this extension will be shipped earlier by end-September 2014. We'll take this chance to incorporate feedbacks we will receive from the previous campaign to deliver a better Duet experience to you.Thank you for your love and support!Do you, or someone you know often lose smartphones?Duet, and the PROTAG app, is an entire eco-system built upon latest Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy technology, to prevent you from losing your phone.

With duet's beep, you’ll know it right away. And for those of us with a habit of losing phones, you will find that Duet’s alarm trains your brain to develop the good habit of checking if the phone’s on you always.

WHAT is an parabolic mirror?
A parabolic mirror reflects light like a normal mirror but while reflecting light it also focuses it into a very small spot.If you use such a mirror in combination with the sun you'll get amazing results!           (Look below for examples)      The problem with parabolic mirrors today:Today's mirrors are either very good but EXPENSIVE or have a really poor quality. You can see there is a GAP and I want to fill it with cheap but high quality parabolic mirrors. Affordable by ANYONE.

What can you do with such a mirror?
Parabolic mirrors are an effective way to use the power of the sun.                             For example: A mirror with a diameter of about 3.5 feet can deliver 1 kW or 1000 Watts. That's enough to set every wood on fire in under one tenth of a second or even melt metal!                                                                                                                                   Now imagine having for example 5 of these in your backyard:

With only 3 hours of sunlight a day you will have 15 kW/h a day of FREE Energy.       That's way more than the needs of an average household!


How can YOU use this much ""free"" energy?

Well, the easiest and most effective way to use concentrated light is to use it as a heat source. As for this method, you only need a black surface, because black surfaces absorb all the light and turn it directly into heat with nearly no energy loss. With the generated heat energy you could for example, in combination with some black cooper pipes, easily heat up the water you need to shower, etc. 



You could also power some kind of steam engine to produce electricity (coming soon if this project will be successful).
A completely different way to use a parabolic mirror is to use it in combination with solar cells and cooper pipes.                                                                                                         Let me explain: First, you point the mirror to the sun.

How the parabolic mirror can help in a Third World country:
An inexpensive parabolic-shaped mirror can be used to get clean drinking water by boiling dirty water from river. Or also to cook something or to easily start a fire. I'm sure even one or two robust mirrors per village would make a permanent difference.

Targeted / Facts:
My targeted price per 1000 Watts (1 kW) mirror, which will have a surface area of 10.76 square feet (equals 1 m²), is roughly 50$.
The complete sun tracker set for one or more mirrors will be about 25$.


What will the money be used for?



Research Purposes: further improving of the quality and price / testing new materials and special coatings etc.

Building a Negative Mold: very expensive but with one negative mold you can build an unlimited amount of good low priced mirrors
Getting Started: building up a small business and make the first line of fully complete finished mirrors for you
Developing a Cheap Sun Tracker: with a sun tracker your mirror will fully automatically follow the sun


Sun Tracker:

A sun tracker is used to adjust your mirror fully automatically directly at the sun for the whole day. I'm currently also working on such a devise! Not on the ultimate high end overly expensive one but on a robust working model for about 25$.
I'm very close to finishing the prototype but i need some more funding to test some things and try other electronic parts/materials so I can then provide the best functional an cheapest tracker for you.



About me:

I have always been a person who wanted to improve things or even build something completely new. Everyday my mind is filled with new ideas that are worth it to be brought to reality. With this project I want to help the entire world. On one hand, it can help poor people, and on the other it helps you to consume less electric power generated by fossil fuel or radioactive materials. So by supporting my work, you're actually helping our whole planet!

I always work tirelessly on my projects and I take them very seriously!


Current Problems:

The road to success has always been a bumpy path, with problems aligned here and there, but this is in no way going to stop me from achieving my goal and with the amount of motivation I bring into this, I am not worried that I won't overcome every obstacle!

By the time, we have improved tageme to its current design which you can find on the pictures. The functionality is still the same.</p><p name=""q2""><b>Q: When will I be able to choose from the colours that I want to order? </b></p><p>A: Once the campaign is over, you will be contacted to choose from the available colours. Even if you order tageme at the first stage of the campaign when are only three colours available, you will have a choice to order from all of them at the end of the campaign (depends on how many stages will be unlocked). </p><p name=""q3""><b>Q: Am I supposed to manually add shipping?</b></p><p>A: Yes, you have to add shipping on top of your selected perk. When you pledge, manually add an additional shipping fee according to the perk you want. We will do the matching at the end of the campaign.</p><p><b>Q: Why do I have to pay for shipping in the US as well? </b></p><p>A: Our headquarters is in Slovakia, Europe. Since this is our first international project, we cannot afford to have offices in the countries, where tageme will be purchased the most. That's why the shipping is not free in the US. </p><p name=""q4""><b>Q: What do I do if I forget to pay for shipping?</b></p><p>A: No problem. Please contribute the shipping amount ($5 or $10 according to perk you bought) and select no perk. It will be added to your pledge amount. Enter the same personal information you did on your initial order. We will do the matching ourselves at the end of the campaign.</p><p name=""q5""><b>Q: You claim that tageme does not require any battery, so it is always ready. How come?</b> </p><p>A:  Thanks to NFC Technology and QR Code. None of them requires any juice - QR code is an information transformed to a visual and NFC operates on the inductive principle. When you tag NFC with your smartphone, it uses a small amount of juice from your device. </p><p name=""q6""><b>Q: QR Code and NFC Technology - those are not the coolest technologies ever.</b> </p><p>A: Good point. But in case of lost &amp; found gadgets, the compatibility is the key feature. That is why we have used these technologies: they are well-known and anyone can use them. Moreover, they are safe and hassle-free. The innovative character of tageme is in its combined solution consisting of SW solution, functionality and design. While it functions very easily and quickly, more &amp; more people can use it and return your lost things back to you.</p><p name=""q7""><b>Q: What is the main difference between tageme and bluetooth trackers? </b></p><p>A: Those are two different gadgets based on two different technologies (bluetooth vs NFC &amp; QR Code). Plus, both have a diverse type of use. Bluetooth is used for the localization of the misplaced items. Tageme, on the other hand, is a truth lost &amp; found. Bluetooth functionality is attractive and we are developing our own solution to be able to combine both technologies into one gadget: anti-misplace as well as lost &amp; found. The biggest challenge of bluetooth technology is in its battery use. Even if it is called LE, it needs a lot of juice. Due to this disadvantage, bluetooth tracker is more or less a cool thing but it is not a hassle-free and effective gadget. Check its reviews.  </p><p name=""q8""><b>Q: How many pieces of tageme can I use? </b></p><p>A: There is no software or any other limitation. You can use as many pieces of tageme as you like. It is purely up to you.</p><p name=""q9""><b>Q: Can tageme help when my belonging gets stolen?</b></p><p>A:  If something is stolen, none lost &amp; found gadget can help you out. Naturally, a thief will get rid off anything that can localize the item. Tageme supports honesty in people and thanks to its reward system, it motivates finders to return the lost belongings. But even in case your tageme gets stolen, a thief has no chance to find out whose tageme he has, or to reveal any other personal details or other tageme of yours.</p><p name=""q10""><b>Q: How resistant tageme actually is?</b> </p><p>A: You can drop it off from heights, wear it with your keys or apply it on a huge dog without worrying about its resistance. You want more? Hang yourself on it and swing if you’d like. Did we answer the question sufficiently? </p><p name=""q11""><b>Q: Is tageme really waterproof? </b> </p><p>A: Yes, it is. It is not an original waterproof gear but it will not get damaged when you/your things fall into the pool with it. Also, it survives all everyday situations connected with water-use. </p><p name=""q12""><b>Q: You promote the compatibility of the tageme. With which smartphones is it compatible then? </b></p><p>A: A finder needs a smartphone that has one of these two features: either QR Code Reader or NFC compatibility. Therein,  every smartphone. </p><p name=""q13""><b>Q: Is tageme safe for my skin or skin of my pet?</b> </p><p>A: Tageme is made of anti-allergic material so it is harmless for your skin or skin of your pet. At the moment, we are testing the most suitable antiallergic materials to keep it resistant, but wholesome firstly.  </p><p name=""q14""><b>Q: How can you claim that it is the world’s most efficient lost &amp; found system? Do you have any proof on this? </b></p><p>A: Nowadays, market is so overwhelmed with smartphones that basically everyone owns one. Therefore, anyone can use tageme and return your lost things back to you. </p><p><b>Q: Why has tageme such an expressive design? These colours could be less gaudy…</b></p><p>A: It is designed to catch finders’ attention on your belonging. Also, its look is a short guideline on how to use it: NFC Logo, QR Code, lost &amp; found logo. </p><p name=""q15""><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Q: My bank has given me <a href=""https://www.extendshop.de/index/Mein-BW-extend/sicherheit/Schluesselfundservice.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this product</a> years ago. It is basically a key label, which has a unique serial number written on it, and if I lose my keys, the finder can drop them into any mail box on the street, and the post will deliver them to my bank, which will afterwards let me know they have my keys. Isn't it basically the same with tageme ?</b><br/></p><p>A: No, it isn't. Imagine you just found out you lost your keys. What are you going to do ? Most probably you are going to turn your home upside-down while searching for it, then your workplace, and if you won't find them go one-by-one through all the places you have been today. If you still won't find them at the end of the day, the next day morning you will get your lock replaced, as you wouldn't like to risk that you might have forgot them in your doors from the outside and someone took them or something similar. In case of the product your bank has given you, even if someone found your keys 10 minutes after you lost them, it would take the post and then the bank at least 1-2 days to let you know someone found them. By that time you would have already replaced your locks, created copies of the new keys for your whole family, informed your workplace, that you lost your keys, etc. If you were using tageme, you would have been informed someone found your keys maybe even before you have realised you lost them.</p><p name=""q17""><b>Q: In our country it is mandatory to have your pet microchipped at a vet. Each chip has a unique code in it a if a pet is found a vet can check, whose pet it is and the pet gets returned afterwards. Does it make any sense for me to get a tageme for my pets ?</b></p><p>A: Sure it does! If you lost your pet, or it ran away for some reason, wouldn't you like to know as soon as possible, that it's ok ? If someone finds it and it is microchipped only, he or she would have to call someone to take care of it and take it to a vet. Only after a vet takes a look at it and reads data from the microchip will someone let you know, that your pet is just fine a was a few blocks away. With tageme, if someone finds it, you are immediately notified, and you can be back together in no time, without bothering and wasting time of a vet or an organisation responsible/caring for lost pets.</p><p></p><p name=""ourteam""></p></div>","Quick jump: Features | Goals | Referral | How Does It Work? | Rewards | How Can You Use tageme? | Production Timeline | The Story Behind tageme | Get In Touch | Press | FAQ | Our TeamFeaturesWhen creating tageme, we wanted to

Due to this disadvantage, bluetooth tracker is more or less a cool thing but it is not a hassle-free and effective gadget. Check its reviews.  Q: How many pieces of tageme can I use? A: There is no software or any other limitation. You can use as many pieces of tageme as you like. It is purely up to you.Q: Can tageme help when my belonging gets stolen?A:  If something is stolen, none lost & found gadget can help you out. Naturally, a thief will get rid off anything that can localize the item. Tageme supports honesty in people and thanks to its reward system, it motivates finders to return the lost belongings. But even in case your tageme gets stolen, a thief has no chance to find out whose tageme he has, or to reveal any other personal details or other tageme of yours.Q: How resistant tageme actually is? A: You can drop it off from heights, wear it with your keys or apply it on a huge dog without worrying about its resistance. You want more? Hang yourself on it and swing if you’d like. Did we answer the question sufficiently? Q: Is tageme really waterproof?  A: Yes, it is. It is not an original waterproof gear but it will not get damaged when you/your things fall into the pool with it. Also, it survives all everyday situations connected with water-use. Q: You promote the compatibility of the tageme. With which smartphones is it compatible then? A: A finder needs a smartphone that has one of these two features: either QR Code Reader or NFC compatibility. Therein,  every smartphone. Q: Is tageme safe for my skin or skin of my pet? A: Tageme is made of anti-allergic material so it is harmless for your skin or skin of your pet. At the moment, we are testing the most suitable antiallergic materials to keep it resistant, but wholesome firstly.  Q: How can you claim that it is the world’s most efficient lost & found system? Do you have any proof on this? A: Nowadays, market is so overwhelmed with smartphones that basically everyone owns one. Therefore, anyone can use tageme and return your lost things back to you. Q: Why has tageme such an expressive design? These colours could be less gaudy…A: It is designed to catch finders’ attention on your belonging. Also, its look is a short guideline on how to use it: NFC Logo, QR Code, lost & found logo. Q: My bank has given me this product years ago. It is basically a key label, which has a unique serial number written on it, and if I lose my keys, the finder can drop them into any mail box on the street, and the post will deliver them to my bank, which will afterwards let me know they have my keys. Isn't it basically the same with tageme ?A: No, it isn't. Imagine you just found out you lost your keys. What are you going to do ? Most probably you are going to turn your home upside-down while searching for it, then your workplace, and if you won't find them go one-by-one through all the places you have been today. If you still won't find them at the end of the day, the next day morning you will get your lock replaced, as you wouldn't like to risk that you might have forgot them in your doors from the outside and someone took them or something similar. In case of the product your bank has given you, even if someone found your keys 10 minutes after you lost them, it would take the post and then the bank at least 1-2 days to let you know someone found them. By that time you would have already replaced your locks, created copies of the new keys for your whole family, informed your workplace, that you lost your keys, etc. If you were using tageme, you would have been informed someone found your keys maybe even before you have realised you lost them.Q: In our country it is mandatory to have your pet microchipped at a vet. Each chip has a unique code in it a if a pet is found a vet can check, whose pet it is and the pet gets returned afterwards. Does it make any sense for me to get a tageme for my pets ?A: Sure it does! If you lost your pet, or it ran away for some reason, wouldn't you like to know as soon as possible, that it's ok ? If someone finds it and it is microchipped only, he or she would have to call someone to take care of it and take it to a vet. Only after a vet takes a look at it and reads data from the microchip will someone let you know, that your pet is just fine a was a few blocks away. With tageme, if someone finds it, you are immediately notified, and you can be back together in no time, without bothering and wasting time of a vet or an organisation responsible/caring for lost pets.",19.0,1,"1 Campaign

The first step to building the INTERSECT: Your computer on the Internet.""/></p>
<h2 style="""">BUTTERFLY EFFECT</h2>
<p><strong>HAVE YOU EVER BELIEVED IN SOMETHING SO STRONGLY THAT YOU FEEL YOU COULD SHOUT IT OUT AT THE TOP OF YOUR LUNGS—BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO HAVE A GLOBAL IMPACT? </strong></p>
<p>That’s how we feel about ISABEL. </p>
<p>When you support ISABEL, you will be helping us provide advanced software to educators, students, and parents. FREE.</p>
<p>But there is more to ISABEL than meets the eye. Driving this project is a powerful concept that can profoundly change children’s lives all over the world.</p>
<p>When we launch ISABEL, it will also create a self-sustaining platform—an economic ecosystem, if you will—that can help schools and communities that results in new jobs, not only here in the U.S. but in other countries too.</p>
<p>All our users need to do is use ISABEL and other applications we will be creating thereafter. And it all begins here. With you.</p>
<h2>WHAT IS ISABEL?</h2>
<p>ISABEL is a powerful suite of web-based tools that will serve students and their parents, teachers, staff members, and professors from elementary schools to college. Isabel will give its users the benefits of advanced design, modern social interaction and information sharing and yet remain circumspect and mindful of every individual’s and group’s privacy.</p>
<p>This cool and awesome project is the first level and first software suite of a larger, longer-term effort that is designed to create a new framework for tomorrow’s technology. It will make traditionally tedious and time-consuming education processes easier for everyone. Like homework, class projects, calendar, quizzes and exams, tracking classes and grades, classroom materials, fund-raising for school projects, communicating with teachers and classmates, and much more.</p>
<p>ISABEL is our first Crowd Funding Project. We hope you like it enough to fund it. It stands for <strong>Insanely Supremely Awesome and Brilliant Ecosystem/4 Learning.</strong> (We love the name so much, we’re printing it on T-Shirts. We had a more official-sounding acronym but it was too boring.)</p>
<p>Some of the sample tools shown here, on our video, and on our website, will be the first tools we build.</p>
<h2>WHERE WE ARE ON THE PROJECT</h2>
<p>ISABEL is just a few weeks away from ALPHA. Design is complete, coding is going strong. We finished our technical proof of concept and are currently working on implementing the functionality we plan to include when we launch ISABEL. (In tech-speak, we’re selecting the final use-cases that will go into version 1.0).</p>
<p>The pilot version was tested by several teachers in Eugene, OR., from February through June of 2012. After getting feedback we completely redesigned the system from the ground up. We estimate that we’re 3-4 months away from a fully operational release that will be available to a select audience, and 6 months from a full launch available to the public.

<h2>NOT A CHARITY NOR CAUSE</h2>
<p>Metroleta was created to help children, teachers, and schools—but it is not a charity, a philanthropy, nor a cause. It is not a non-profit corporation. At its core it is a Silicon Valley-style start-up with advanced technology, brand-engineering, and high-level design as its core competencies.</p>
<p>The INTERSECT and ISABEL software will create a product platform that will enable users to practice mass philanthropy. But it is not truly free. The cost to the user will be the time they spend on Metroleta.com. The same is true for teachers, who will directly benefit from using the system.</p>
<p>Metroleta will raise funds through advertising, product sales, and software licensing to businesses and larger organizations such as colleges.</p>

<li>ISABEL will be completed and released for use by teachers, parents, professors, students, and the public—for free.</li>
<li>The framework and first subsystems of the advanced technology called the INTERSECT will be created.</li>

<li>We will build an ecosystem that creates the revenue to help students, makes life easier for teachers, saves schools cash (to perhaps hire new teachers), and makes businesses and advertisers happy and proud. And puts school supplies and food in the hands of children in need.</li>

<h2>IF YOU SPEAK NERDIC...</h2>
<h3>Warning. Technology content follows.</h3>
<p>ISABEL is a non-linear graph-based online application designed with deep interoperability among its user-base, functions, and peer-systems. It addresses use-cases and actors common to the non-administration side of education (i.e. students, faculty, and parents). We intend to create a follow-up peer subsystem to address the needs of the Student Services and Administrative sides of any educational institution, be it school, district, or college.</p>
<p>Conceptually, ISABEL’s design takes graph theory and social-oriented design and pushes them further into deeper dimensions. It is considerably different from procedural or “process-driven” applications typically found in education and business. It should be noted that version 1 of ISABEL is intended as a bridge app to span the chasm of today’s traditional Internet systems and tomorrow’s INTERSECT framework. In the following versions, ISABEL will be refactored to fully capitalize on the INTERSECT’s advantages.</p>

<h2>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</h2>
<p>We have taken steps to mitigate those problems that, from long experience, typically occur in software development.

<p>We are also well aware that our success depends on achieving a critical mass of users beyond the regional education arena that METROLETA is currently in. This is also the reason why we have been diligently preparing our marketing, communications, and social media campaigns.</p>
<p>ISABEL is a much-needed alternative to what teachers, professors, parents and students have at their disposal today. We are confident that ISABEL’s advanced design will help create a vibrant community of users around it.</p>
<h2>IT ALL DEPENDS ON YOU</h2>
<p>How much we will be able to build initially will depend on how much funding you help us raise. The more funds we raise, the more functions we will be able to include in the first release of ISABEL.</p>
<p>One thing is sure. When you help fund this project, many teachers and students will have more than just a powerful tool, they will have a resource that can help make life a little easier for the children.</p></div>","BUTTERFLY EFFECT
HAVE YOU EVER BELIEVED IN SOMETHING SO STRONGLY THAT YOU FEEL YOU COULD SHOUT IT OUT AT THE TOP OF YOUR LUNGS—BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO HAVE A GLOBAL IMPACT? 
That’s how we feel about ISABEL. 
When you support ISABEL, you will be helping us provide advanced software to educators, students, and parents. FREE.
But there is more to ISABEL than meets the eye. Driving this project is a powerful concept that can profoundly change children’s lives all over the world.
When we launch ISABEL, it will also create a self-sustaining platform—an economic ecosystem, if you will—that can help schools and communities that results in new jobs, not only here in the U.S. but in other countries too.
All our users need to do is use ISABEL and other applications we will be creating thereafter. And it all begins here. With you.
WHAT IS ISABEL?
ISABEL is a powerful suite of web-based tools that will serve students and their parents, teachers, staff members, and professors from elementary schools to college. Isabel will give its users the benefits of advanced design, modern social interaction and information sharing and yet remain circumspect and mindful of every individual’s and group’s privacy.
This cool and awesome project is the first level and first software suite of a larger, longer-term effort that is designed to create a new framework for tomorrow’s technology. It will make traditionally tedious and time-consuming education processes easier for everyone. Like homework, class projects, calendar, quizzes and exams, tracking classes and grades, classroom materials, fund-raising for school projects, communicating with teachers and classmates, and much more.
ISABEL is our first Crowd Funding Project. We hope you like it enough to fund it. It stands for Insanely Supremely Awesome and Brilliant Ecosystem/4 Learning. (We love the name so much, we’re printing it on T-Shirts. We had a more official-sounding acronym but it was too boring.)
Some of the sample tools shown here, on our video, and on our website, will be the first tools we build.
WHERE WE ARE ON THE PROJECT
ISABEL is just a few weeks away from ALPHA. Design is complete, coding is going strong. We finished our technical proof of concept and are currently working on implementing the functionality we plan to include when we launch ISABEL. (In tech-speak, we’re selecting the final use-cases that will go into version 1.0).
The pilot version was tested by several teachers in Eugene, OR., from February through June of 2012. After getting feedback we completely redesigned the system from the ground up. We estimate that we’re 3-4 months away from a fully operational release that will be available to a select audience, and 6 months from a full launch available to the public. Sooner if we are able to raise more funds.

The INTERSECT and ISABEL software will create a product platform that will enable users to practice mass philanthropy. But it is not truly free. The cost to the user will be the time they spend on Metroleta.com. The same is true for teachers, who will directly benefit from using the system.
Metroleta will raise funds through advertising, product sales, and software licensing to businesses and larger organizations such as colleges.
GOOD THINGS HAPPEN WHEN YOU FUND ISABEL

ISABEL will be completed and released for use by teachers, parents, professors, students, and the public—for free.
The framework and first subsystems of the advanced technology called the INTERSECT will be created.
Metroleta will start to build revenue from advertising and sales, and then create jobs and hire additional programmers to build the next subsystems.
We will build an ecosystem that creates the revenue to help students, makes life easier for teachers, saves schools cash (to perhaps hire new teachers), and makes businesses and advertisers happy and proud. And puts school supplies and food in the hands of children in need.

Well now you can, all whilst still utilizing our next generation wireless charging station.Perfect Night Stand and Alarm ClockThe other design features that make the iComboStand superior than current wireless chargers is the fact that it enables you to set up your iPhone as your Alarm Clock.

Design Background</h2><p>When designing the CSB502SSD we looked at the 
broader Raspberry PI shield market to determine what made sense for a 
multi-function shield oriented toward embedded control and development. 
 Along the way we made a handful of decisions and this is a bit of 
background on this.</p><p><b>USB Hub </b>- The CSB502SSD interfaces to the Raspberry Pi 2 via 
GPIO, I2C and one USB port.  That port connects to a four port USB hub. 
 Two ports are used by the WiFi and SATA, while the other two go to 
separate USB Type-A connectors.  These ports provide a minimum of 1.5A 
per port.</p><p></p><p><b>SSD Socket </b>- We chose the mSata for this project since it 
offered the most capacity in the space we had available. Although we 
have used, and continue to use the newer M2 form factor where space is 
tight, mSata was the best choice for the CSB502SSD.  The <a href=""http://prolificusa.com/portfolio/pl-2571-hi-speed-usb-to-sataii-bridge-controller/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">PL2571 Hi-Speed USB to SATAII Bridge Controller</a>  was chosen as it offered great Linux support while being low cost and low powered.</p><p><b>WiFi </b>- The <a href=""http://ogemraywireless.en.made-in-china.com/product/veqxXREjZbTo/China-High-Sensivity-Mini-150Mbps-1t1r-Wireless-Embedded-USB-Module-GWF-3M08-.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">GWF-3M08</a> is a small, low cost module based on the popular <a href=""http://www.mediatek.com/en/products/connectivity/wifi/broadband/usb/rt5370/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Ralink RT5370</a>
 chip.  This chip supports 802.11b/g/n speeds at low power and with 
Soft-AP support so you can use the Raspberry PI 2 as a WiFi access 
point.  Again, great Linux support was a key factor in our decision.</p><p><b>RTC w/Battery </b>- Many DIY projects have chosen the Dallas//Maxim DS1307 Real Time Clock.  The <a href=""https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/digital/real-time-clocks/DS1339.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dallas/Maxim DS1339</a>
 we chose is software compatible, but offers extra features such as 
programmable alarm, auto-switch over from the 3V rail to the battery, as
 well as trickle charge for re-chargeable coin cells.  A 16mm coin cell 
holder allows for up to 250ma/hr non-rechargeable as well as 
re-chargeable cells.</p><p> <b>Temp Sensor </b>- A key issue for SSD drives is that they can be sensitive to temperature.  The <a href=""https://www.maximintegrated.com/en/products/analog/sensors-and-sensor-interface/DS18B20.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dallas/Maxim DS18B20</a>
 provides an easy I2C interface to monitor the ambient temperature at 
the SSD drive itself.  While some SSD's support internal temperature 
monitoring, most lower cost, commercial units do not.  An added bonus is
 the inclusion of a unique 64-bit ID allowing each CSB502SSD to be 
identified and tracked for asset management purposes.</p><p><b>On-Board Power Supply</b>
 - The maximum input of 5V @ 700ma via the Raspberry Pi 2 Micro-USB 
connector has always limited power available to the four USB ports.  
Although the CSB502SSD uses one Raspberry PI 2 USB port, it does not 
take any power from it.  Instead an external 12V brick supplies power to
 the CSB502SSD via a standard 2.1mm barrel jack.  The 5V @ 10A supply on
 the CSB502SSD powers all peripherals, plus the Raspberry Pi (up to 4A).</p><p><br/></p><p></p><h2>Custom Projects</h2><p>Recently the Raspberry Pi foundation announced a new program to allow users to create their

<h3><strong>Hello friends! Thanks for visiting our Indiegogo page for The Draw Thing, the first game inspired and affordable touchscreen stylus that helps give you an edge over your Draw Something friends. <em>The Draw Thing</em>™ will enhance your all around Draw Something™ game on iPad®, iPhone®, iPod® touch and Android® devices.</strong></h3>
<div>
<div>
<p><strong>Draw Something is the new app that has taken the world of smartphones by storm.  An online version of Pictionary®, it allows players to use Apple® and Android devices as a canvas.  Until now players had to use their fingers as a paintbrush.  With <em>The Draw Thing</em> you will be able to transform your doodles from finger-painting into art.</strong></p>
<div>
<p><strong><em>The Draw Thing</em> was born out of our desire to have a really great stylus for the amazing Draw Something game. We bought several different stylus models currently available on the market but they all suffered the same problem: they were designed to look and feel like a pen and did not have kids in mind. In addition we have a rubber sleeve that can be interchanged with different  colored sleeves. We will be adding licensed designed sleeves as well so collect them all! </strong></p>
<p><strong>Once again, we can’t thank you all enough for your support. You are allowing us to continue to do what we love. As you can see, The Draw Thing is the labor of love of two individuals, Dan Weinstein and Doron J Fetman. With your support we will continue to bring innovative designs to market. We are a team of creative out of the box thinkers committed to the philosophy that through strategic thinking and innovative design a concept can become reality.</strong></p>

</div></div>","Our Story   

1 in 5 young women will be a victim of sexual assault during college. 

We are sick and tired of this behavior. Aren't you? We can all do better to prevent sexual assault and dating violence BEFORE it happens. 

We
 know that close relationships are the cornerstone of college life. We 
designed this App to highlight these bonds, and link you to your friends
 and the people you love, to help prevent violence, get home safely, and
 look out for each other. To make sure that no one suffers needlessly 
and to prevent violence before it happens.

To do this, we created the Circle of 6 mobile app and are determined to make it FREE.

Our goal is to get the app in the hands of 30,000 college students by the end of 2012.

The Apps Against Abuse challenge had NO CASH PRIZE. Our amazing team is left to our own devices to raise the funds. 

Here's the deal: We are COUNTING ON 2500 donors to give $10 each. To
 do that, use the Share Tools to tell 10 (or 100!) people you know about
 Circle of 6. And then, they can each tell 10, and another 10 and so on.

<p>Wow don't you get tired of your cell phone dying while you’re out with friends or just stopping by the local bar on the way home. Hi everyone, I'm a former Restaurant/Bar owner for over 16 years. While out one night having dinner I was sitting at the bar waiting for a phone call with my girlfriend and my phone lit up and I thought great here it is, WRONG my phone said powering down my battery was DEAD.

Wow don't you get tired of your cell phone dying while you’re out with friends or just stopping by the local bar on the way home. Hi everyone, I'm a former Restaurant/Bar owner for over 16 years. While out one night having dinner I was sitting at the bar waiting for a phone call with my girlfriend and my phone lit up and I thought great here it is, WRONG my phone said powering down my battery was DEAD. Has this ever happened to you? I bet it has. So as I walk out to my car to plug my cell phone in and came back into the bar and I had to keep running back and fourth to try to catch the call, VERY FRUSTRATING. As I’m sitting eating I look up and down the bar and everyone is either on there phone or it is sitting in front of them on the bar that’s when it hit me WE NEED A COURTESY CHARGER.

<p></p>
<h3>Common Questions</h3>Will Flash Flood effect the speakers on the HTC m8 - As long as you follow the video, no problem I use the m8 myself. It's been tested on all kind of speakers and there are no problems. As standard Flash Flood covers the ear speaker on all phones so there is no difference, you may get some distortion or low volume for a couple of hours if too much liquid goes inside, but once dry in a few hours it will go back to normal. It's designed not to causes any damage to electronics or speakers.<br/><p></p>
<p>Will Flash Flood effect the iphone 5s Finger Scan - Flash Flood will not effect the finger scan, the coating drys 40,000 times thinner than a human hair. </p>
<p>Will Liquid Sapphire effect the iPhone 5s finger scan -  There is no need to coat the finger scan button as it's made out of real sapphire.</p>
<p>Will Liquid Sapphire &amp; Flash Flood work on the new iPhone 6 </p>
<p>Yes it will.<br/></p>

Common QuestionsWill Flash Flood effect the speakers on the HTC m8 - As long as you follow the video, no problem I use the m8 myself. It's been tested on all kind of speakers and there are no problems. As standard Flash Flood covers the ear speaker on all phones so there is no difference, you may get some distortion or low volume for a couple of hours if too much liquid goes inside, but once dry in a few hours it will go back to normal. It's designed not to causes any damage to electronics or speakers.
Will Flash Flood effect the iphone 5s Finger Scan - Flash Flood will not effect the finger scan, the coating drys 40,000 times thinner than a human hair. 
Will Liquid Sapphire effect the iPhone 5s finger scan -  There is no need to coat the finger scan button as it's made out of real sapphire.
Will Liquid Sapphire & Flash Flood work on the new iPhone 6 
Yes it will.",10.0,3,"3 Campaigns

<p>BARTR is more than a mobile app, it's a supplement to the cash we carry in our wallets and the amount on our bank statements. It's goal is to simplify the current bartering methods--countless posts to wade through, endless conversations for deal making, tons of websites and groups to sift through--by using the swipe left/swipe right method of Tinder and geofiltering. Almost anything can be traded to save your hard earned money: Home goods, Handmade items, Tutoring, Technical skills, business perks...the list is endless!</p>

<p>BARTR cares about our user's safety, and we know that meeting up to make a trade can get a little...sketchy. So we're using the geolocation feature of our app to create another layer of safety for our users. You can opt to create a ""safety pin""--a four digit code--and a phone contact before meeting for the trade, and BARTR will check in throughout the meetup, prompting for the pin. If the pin is put in incorrectly or not put in at all, the app will send your location to your phone contact along with a message alerting them, so that help can be sent to you. Our aim is to not only make bartering easy, but also secure for all parties involved!</p>

<p>Hi! My name is Deborah Williams. I'm a farmer's wife, boy-mom, author, and the founder of BARTR.</p>
<p>BARTR started as just a passing thought, when bills were being paid but items in for-sale groups kept catching my eye. It's hard to save for the things you need money for while still getting the things that you want. And it's especially hard when small business expenses creep up. But current bartering sites and groups just hadn't caught up to the browsing ease I've grown accustomed to-- it was all time consuming and clunky to look at.</p>
<p>So I decided to change that. Being an author means I'm no stranger to a lot of rejection and a lot of obstacles, but it also means that I can take feedback and run with it. And that's what I've done. Going through countless versions of business plans and investor comments, together with Dom &amp; Tom app developers and Appency marketers, we're ready to begin development on an app that's going to change the way we trade so we can change the way we save.</p>

<p>We're entering the Discovery Phase of development, which means our development partners at Dom &amp; Tom are ready to start creating the prototype of our app in preparation for full scale development. To make that happen, we need two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A few weeks of developmental R&amp;D</li>
<li>$37,000 and the support of our backers!</li>
</ul>
<p>This covers the total cost of prototype development, including the labor costs of our developers. From here, we begin beta testing, which some of our backers will have the opportunity to be a part of!</p>
<p>We hope to make our full goal, because without that, it becomes harder to make this app and our goals possible, but even if we don't reach it, every donation made will go towards prototyping costs and an appeal will be made based on our backers' interest to investors who've discussed being part of our overall development funding. Because every dollar represents traction in the market, presenting it to angel investors will help tremendously in gaining funding for full scale development.</p>

<p>We know that the barter system can't ever replace money, but we do know that it can help supplement it so that the things we can't help but need money for can be saved for.

We know that the barter system can't ever replace money, but we do know that it can help supplement it so that the things we can't help but need money for can be saved for. We know that individuals and small businesses can benefit from the exchange of goods and services to free up cash for the important stuff, and we want to be a part of building a community that does just that, all at the familiar swipe of a finger!
 
---Other Ways You Can Help---

<p><strong>THE FUTURE OF SHOPPING IS NEAR...</strong></p>
<p>Questions:</p>
<p>Are you tired of Traditional e-commerce solutions that are slow, cumbersome and clunky?  Searching through various sites for different products, trying to find the best deal, or it's exactly what you want. This can often take many hours of online comparison and effort. </p>
<p>And Is the e-commerce site you are thinking of purchasing from real? Is the product real?</p>
<p>In some cases, it seems that it would be easier for you to drive to the store, pick out what you want, pay for it and drive home - but then there is the parking situation? Shopping should not be this difficult - PERIOD.</p>
<p>Would you value having a sales assistant as your own personal shopper to help you from stores locally and worldwide to assist you with making the right decision and confidently?</p>
<p> The Answer - We can help you!</p>
<p>Our solution will make shopping a breeze.  It will empower you to become a trusted and valued customer where ever you decide to shop. You'll receive VIP treatment, with a personal shopping experience and enjoy your shopping adventure. as it should be an enjoyable experience.</p>
<p><strong>GAME CHANGING TECHNOLOGY IS COMING</strong></p>
<p>Founder of Amazon Jeff Bezos knew he would never be able to offer the kind of online experience one gets from a physical store staffed by human helpers through his e-commerce site..</p>
<p>""We "" are never going to have sofas; we're never going to have lattes,"" Jeff said back in 1997 to Business Week Magazine.</p>
<p> Founder of Zappos Tony Hsieh ,believes ""The delivering of happiness, is a successful business model"".</p>
<p> Founder of open4sale Simon La Barrie, aims to bring the concepts of two of the most successful e-commerce creators together with his vision: ""I want to bring the sofa and lattes to online shopping and by delivering happiness to customers along the way in the process"".</p>
<p>Open4sale portal technology was created to revolutionize online shopping as we know it and enhance the customer experience for online shoppers and bring back the customer service you deserve -  we are to dramatically change the world of shopping.</p>

<p><span>There will be many more additional features added to the application in the future. </span></p>
<p><span></span> <span><strong>HOW IT WORKS</strong></span></p>
<p><span>Customers are able to link to retailers through an Audio/Video Connection currently via a Ipad/</span><span>tablet, then smartphone, and a desktop connection later.</span></p>
<span><p> •The app is interactive and very easy to use, and gives customers the ability to search products as if they were physically in the store. Customers are greeted by the real store assistant's from the comfort of their own surroundings , where they can engage with the store assistant , look around the store and then then purchase products with guaranteed safety..</p>
<p>• Open4sale gives customers a greater online experience by giving them a real person to speak with, who can provide the same level of attention that they would receive if they were physically in the store themselves. The video definition has been developed to be higher quality than that seen with normal video conferencing, Skype and FaceTime applications, and customers are able to touch and research products, ask questions and make confident purchases with the help of a personal shopper in the store.</p></span><p> </p>

<p> <strong>The Business side of Things-</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong> <strong>Use of Funds </strong></p>
<p> Every dollar we raise will be directed towards improving our technology to become commercially ready, by helping us to schedule and book our Launch Events, provide our customers with more  benefits and rewards, and further progress towards bringing this 21st century technology to the online world.</p>
<p>   <strong>The Core technology Vision</strong></p>
<p>As the Achilles heel of online shopping has always been the ""one-way"" (lack of) interaction between the buyer and product. Open4Sale has spent 3 years developing a proprietary, ""two-way,"" person-to-person platform where buyers and sellers are brought together in real-time. </p>
<p>The overall objective design and development of the Open4Sale platform is to create a innovative technology to allow consumers to have a face to face interaction with the bricks and mortar store front, and create a virtual shopping center that goes over and above the standard norm of current online shopping.</p>
<p> </p>

Questions:
Are you tired of Traditional e-commerce solutions that are slow, cumbersome and clunky?  Searching through various sites for different products, trying to find the best deal, or it's exactly what you want. This can often take many hours of online comparison and effort. 
And Is the e-commerce site you are thinking of purchasing from real? Is the product real?
In some cases, it seems that it would be easier for you to drive to the store, pick out what you want, pay for it and drive home - but then there is the parking situation? Shopping should not be this difficult - PERIOD.
Would you value having a sales assistant as your own personal shopper to help you from stores locally and worldwide to assist you with making the right decision and confidently?

""We "" are never going to have sofas; we're never going to have lattes,"" Jeff said back in 1997 to Business Week Magazine.
 Founder of Zappos Tony Hsieh ,believes ""The delivering of happiness, is a successful business model"".
 Founder of open4sale Simon La Barrie, aims to bring the concepts of two of the most successful e-commerce creators together with his vision: ""I want to bring the sofa and lattes to online shopping and by delivering happiness to customers along the way in the process"".

 HOW IT WORKS
Customers are able to link to retailers through an Audio/Video Connection currently via a Ipad/tablet, then smartphone, and a desktop connection later.
 •The app is interactive and very easy to use, and gives customers the ability to search products as if they were physically in the store. Customers are greeted by the real store assistant's from the comfort of their own surroundings , where they can engage with the store assistant , look around the store and then then purchase products with guaranteed safety..
• Open4sale gives customers a greater online experience by giving them a real person to speak with, who can provide the same level of attention that they would receive if they were physically in the store themselves. The video definition has been developed to be higher quality than that seen with normal video conferencing, Skype and FaceTime applications, and customers are able to touch and research products, ask questions and make confident purchases with the help of a personal shopper in the store.

   The Core technology Vision
As the Achilles heel of online shopping has always been the ""one-way"" (lack of) interaction between the buyer and product. Open4Sale has spent 3 years developing a proprietary, ""two-way,"" person-to-person platform where buyers and sellers are brought together in real-time. 
The overall objective design and development of the Open4Sale platform is to create a innovative technology to allow consumers to have a face to face interaction with the bricks and mortar store front, and create a virtual shopping center that goes over and above the standard norm of current online shopping.

<h1><b>The birth</b></h1>
<p>My name
is Andrés Salcedo and I am the developer of the project. The idea for this
project was born after reading that a computer security researcher had been
able to brake the code of <b><i>Telegram</i></b>'s App messages. Then this
idea turned into a project after watching Alex Winter's documentary called <b><i>Deep
Web</i></b>.</p>
<p>This project is a change proposal for messaging
Apps which do not protect our anonymity and the privacy of our messages.
Currently anonymity on the internet has become taboo. However, it is</p>
<p>everyone's right, and our App has the aim of
providing the highest levels of anonymity in a simple way for all our messages,
and for this reason it is the first messaging App for Smartphones that
communicates via <b>TOR</b>.</p>
<h1><b>El nacimiento </b></h1>
<p>Mi nombre es Andrés Salcedo y
soy el promotor del proyecto. La idea de este proyecto nació después de la leer
que un investigador de seguridad informática, había sido capaz de romper el
cifrado de los mensajes de la App de mensajería <b><i>Telegram </i></b>y se
convirtió en un proyecto después de ver el documental de Alex Winter llamado <b><i>Web
profunda</i></b>. </p>
<p>El proyecto es una propuesta de
cambio para las App de mensajería que no protegen nuestro anonimato y la
privacidad de nuestros mensajes. Actualmente el anonimato en internet se ha
convertido en un tabú, sin embargo es un derecho de todos nosotros y nuestra
App tiene como finalidad, brindar de una forma fácil y sencilla los más altos
niveles de anonimato y seguridad de todos nuestros mensajes, por esta razón es
la primera App de mensajería para Smartphone que se comunica por <b>TOR</b>. <br/></p><p><br/></p>
<h1><b>The project</b></h1><p><br/></p>
<h3>The
project involves developing a smartphone messaging app that transmits messages
through the TOR  (The onion ruoter), protected by a password of up to
<strong>4096</strong> bit keys <i>asymmetric encryption</i>.There is no need to register your
personal data or phone number to use the App and all users will have a (single
and intransferable) ID to identify themselves with other users as well as a user
number with a 512-bit keys, for those who want to transfer their ID to another
terminal (Smartphone). Besides, users can also protect their App, by a key of
up to 256 bit. These characteristics translate into the more secure and
anonymous messaging system that has been seen so far.</h3><p><br/></p>
<h1><b>El proyecto </b></h1><p><br/></p>
<h3>El proyecto consiste en el desarrollo de una App
de mensajería para Smartphone que transmite mensajes a través de la red TOR
(The onion ruoter), protegido por una clave de hasta <strong>4096</strong> bit y <i>encriptación
asimétrica. </i>No es necesario registrar nuestros datos personales o número de
teléfono para utilizar la App y todos los usuarios tendrán una ID (único e
intransferible) para identificarse con otros usuarios y un numero de usuario
con una clave de 512 bit,<span>  para cuando
los usuarios quieran transferir su ID a otro terminal (Smartphone), además los
usuarios podrán proteger su App, por medio de una clave de hasta 256 bit. Estas
características se traducen en el sistema de mensajería más seguro y anónimo
que se ha visto hasta ahora. </span>

'<a href=""https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TOR</a>', is a project whose main objective is the development of a distributed
low-latency communications network and superimposed on internet, where the
routing of messages exchanged between users does not reveal their identity,
i.e. your IP address (anonymity at a network level) and which also preserves
the integrity and confidentiality of information travelling through it. For
this reason it is called Darknet or Deep Web. The main objective of TOR is to
get the internet to be used in a way so that the routing of the message
protects the identity of users, that is, so that it cannot track the
information sent by a user to reach it.</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>The Onion Router, abreviado en
inglés como '<a href=""https://www.torproject.org/about/overview.html.en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">TOR</a>', es un proyecto cuyo objetivo principal es el desarrollo de
una red de comunicaciones distribuida de baja latencia y superpuesta sobre
internet, en la que el encaminamiento de los mensajes intercambiados entre los
usuarios no revela su identidad, es decir, su dirección IP (anonimato a nivel
de red) y que, además, mantiene la integridad y el secreto de la información
que viaja por ella, por este motivo se le conoce como Darknet o Deep web. El
objetivo principal de TOR es conseguir que internet pueda usarse de forma que
el encaminamiento de los mensajes proteja la identidad de los usuarios, es decir
persigue que no se pueda rastrear la información que envía un usuario para
llegar hasta él. </p>
<br/><h1>¿Which is asymmetric key cryptography?</h1><p><br/></p><h1></h1><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441639053/ypt9t5dsxzidrodoy0sa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>
</p><p></p>Asymmetric
cryptography is the cryptographic method that uses a pair of keys for
messaging. The two keys belong to the same person who sent the message. One key
is public and can be delivered to anyone, the other key is private and the
owner should keep it so that nobody has access to it.<p> In addition, the
cryptographic methods ensure that set of keys can only be generated once, so
you can assume it is not possible for two people coincidentally to have
obtained the same key pair. If the sender uses the recipient's public key to
encrypt the message, once encrypted, only the recipient's private key can
decrypt this message, because he is the only one who knows it. <br/></p><p>Therefore the
message is completely confidential, no one but the recipient can decrypt it.</p>
<p><br/></p><h1></h1>
<h1><b>¿Qué es la criptografía
asimétrica? </b></h1><p><br/></p>
<p>La criptografía asimétrica es
el método criptográfico que usa un par de claves para el envío de mensajes. Las
dos claves pertenecen a la misma persona que ha enviado el mensaje. Una clave
es pública y se puede entregar a cualquier persona, la otra clave es privada y
el propietario debe guardarla de modo que nadie tenga acceso a ella. <br/></p><p>Además,
los métodos criptográficos garantizan que esa pareja de claves sólo se puede
generar una vez, de modo que se puede asumir que no es posible que dos personas
hayan obtenido casualmente la misma pareja de claves. Si el remitente usa la
clave pública del destinatario para cifrar el mensaje, una vez cifrado, sólo la
clave privada del destinatario podrá descifrar este mensaje, ya que es el único
que la conoce. <br/></p><p>Por tanto se logra la confidencialidad del envío del mensaje,
nadie salvo el destinatario puede descifrarlo. </p>

develop an App that will open a new path for messaging Apps and generate a

     ¿ How much does your privacy? 


The birth
My name
is Andrés Salcedo and I am the developer of the project. The idea for this
project was born after reading that a computer security researcher had been
able to brake the code of Telegram's App messages. Then this
idea turned into a project after watching Alex Winter's documentary called Deep
Web.
This project is a change proposal for messaging
Apps which do not protect our anonymity and the privacy of our messages.
Currently anonymity on the internet has become taboo. However, it is
everyone's right, and our App has the aim of
providing the highest levels of anonymity in a simple way for all our messages,
and for this reason it is the first messaging App for Smartphones that
communicates via TOR.
El nacimiento 
Mi nombre es Andrés Salcedo y
soy el promotor del proyecto. La idea de este proyecto nació después de la leer
que un investigador de seguridad informática, había sido capaz de romper el
cifrado de los mensajes de la App de mensajería Telegram y se
convirtió en un proyecto después de ver el documental de Alex Winter llamado Web
profunda. 
El proyecto es una propuesta de
cambio para las App de mensajería que no protegen nuestro anonimato y la
privacidad de nuestros mensajes. Actualmente el anonimato en internet se ha
convertido en un tabú, sin embargo es un derecho de todos nosotros y nuestra
App tiene como finalidad, brindar de una forma fácil y sencilla los más altos
niveles de anonimato y seguridad de todos nuestros mensajes, por esta razón es
la primera App de mensajería para Smartphone que se comunica por TOR. 
The project
The
project involves developing a smartphone messaging app that transmits messages
through the TOR  (The onion ruoter), protected by a password of up to
4096 bit keys asymmetric encryption.There is no need to register your
personal data or phone number to use the App and all users will have a (single
and intransferable) ID to identify themselves with other users as well as a user
number with a 512-bit keys, for those who want to transfer their ID to another
terminal (Smartphone). Besides, users can also protect their App, by a key of
up to 256 bit. These characteristics translate into the more secure and
anonymous messaging system that has been seen so far.
El proyecto 
El proyecto consiste en el desarrollo de una App
de mensajería para Smartphone que transmite mensajes a través de la red TOR
(The onion ruoter), protegido por una clave de hasta 4096 bit y encriptación
asimétrica. No es necesario registrar nuestros datos personales o número de
teléfono para utilizar la App y todos los usuarios tendrán una ID (único e
intransferible) para identificarse con otros usuarios y un numero de usuario
con una clave de 512 bit,  para cuando
los usuarios quieran transferir su ID a otro terminal (Smartphone), además los
usuarios podrán proteger su App, por medio de una clave de hasta 256 bit. Estas
características se traducen en el sistema de mensajería más seguro y anónimo
que se ha visto hasta ahora. 


¿What is TOR?
The Onion Router, abbreviated in English as
'TOR', is a project whose main objective is the development of a distributed
low-latency communications network and superimposed on internet, where the
routing of messages exchanged between users does not reveal their identity,
i.e. your IP address (anonymity at a network level) and which also preserves
the integrity and confidentiality of information travelling through it. For
this reason it is called Darknet or Deep Web. The main objective of TOR is to
get the internet to be used in a way so that the routing of the message
protects the identity of users, that is, so that it cannot track the
information sent by a user to reach it.
¿ Qué es TOR ?


The Onion Router, abreviado en
inglés como 'TOR', es un proyecto cuyo objetivo principal es el desarrollo de
una red de comunicaciones distribuida de baja latencia y superpuesta sobre
internet, en la que el encaminamiento de los mensajes intercambiados entre los
usuarios no revela su identidad, es decir, su dirección IP (anonimato a nivel
de red) y que, además, mantiene la integridad y el secreto de la información
que viaja por ella, por este motivo se le conoce como Darknet o Deep web. El
objetivo principal de TOR es conseguir que internet pueda usarse de forma que
el encaminamiento de los mensajes proteja la identidad de los usuarios, es decir
persigue que no se pueda rastrear la información que envía un usuario para
llegar hasta él. 
¿Which is asymmetric key cryptography?

Asymmetric
cryptography is the cryptographic method that uses a pair of keys for
messaging. The two keys belong to the same person who sent the message. One key
is public and can be delivered to anyone, the other key is private and the
owner should keep it so that nobody has access to it. In addition, the
cryptographic methods ensure that set of keys can only be generated once, so
you can assume it is not possible for two people coincidentally to have
obtained the same key pair. If the sender uses the recipient's public key to
encrypt the message, once encrypted, only the recipient's private key can
decrypt this message, because he is the only one who knows it. Therefore the
message is completely confidential, no one but the recipient can decrypt it.

¿Qué es la criptografía
asimétrica? 
La criptografía asimétrica es
el método criptográfico que usa un par de claves para el envío de mensajes. Las
dos claves pertenecen a la misma persona que ha enviado el mensaje. Una clave
es pública y se puede entregar a cualquier persona, la otra clave es privada y
el propietario debe guardarla de modo que nadie tenga acceso a ella. Además,
los métodos criptográficos garantizan que esa pareja de claves sólo se puede
generar una vez, de modo que se puede asumir que no es posible que dos personas
hayan obtenido casualmente la misma pareja de claves. Si el remitente usa la
clave pública del destinatario para cifrar el mensaje, una vez cifrado, sólo la
clave privada del destinatario podrá descifrar este mensaje, ya que es el único
que la conoce. Por tanto se logra la confidencialidad del envío del mensaje,
nadie salvo el destinatario puede descifrarlo. 

You can help!
With your financial support we will be able to
develop an App that will open a new path for messaging Apps and generate a
radical change in the information world, because anyone will have access to the
largest and most private network in the world. I believe that freedom of
expression is a right and we need more and better ways to safeguard this human
birthright.
¡ Tú puedes ayudar !
Con vuestro apoyo financiero
conseguiremos desarrollar una App que marcara un nuevo camino en las App de
mensajería y generara un cambio radical en el mundo de la información, porque
cualquier persona tendrá acceso a la red de comunicación más anónima y privada
del mundo. Creo que la libertad de expresión es un derecho y se necesitan más y
mejores sistemas para salvaguardar un derecho innato al ser humano.

<p>Here are the 3 steps to accomplishing this mission.</p>
<p><b>Step 1: “When you fell in love with something, you can’t get it off your mind.”</b></p>
<p>One day, on a bus to the airport, I as usual, ponder over new ideas to improve people’s life. The work scenes earlier that day kept flashing back. There were moments that I was pretty frustrated by my computer. I wanted to charge my cell and iPad at the same time, preparing for the trip. But I was not able to do so due to the limited number of the USB ports. Only one port was available…Damn! <b>“</b><b>Why not make the most out of this one port?”</b> An idea suddenly crossed over my mind. If I could offer another port while using this only one port, then technically I could have infinite USB ports for my tasks. Bingo! I was so excited about the idea and couldn’t wait to sketch it out. Therefore the first drawing of InfiniteUSB was born during the flight. After landing, I rushed home and transformed the initial drawing into a rendering on computer.</p>
<p>Things become pretty amazing after InfiniteUSB won an iF Award. Thousands of people emailed me to express their affection for this product. They told me how they love this idea and how much they want the product. I was deeply touched and greatly encouraged. Since that moment, I decide to bring this product into people’s life. I am determined to make it happen!</p>

<p>We wanted Gecko to be an easy to use and fit into everyone's lifestyle.</p>
<p>We have completed Hardware and Firmware design. <span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We went through two rounds of testing and pilot production with the initial version of the product in a different form factor deployed in a couple of use cases. </span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;""></span></p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">Initial version of gecko: </span><span style=""line-height: 1.45em;"">We have built the complete ecosystem of Chipset vendors and manufacturing partner to mass produce Gecko.</span></p>
<p>The basic Gecko application is working on iOS devices and Samsung Galaxy S4. We are currently testing the Gecko App for Android 4.3. We are now working on integrating additional features and connected Gecko cloud.</p>

<h2>Why anonymity matters?<br/>
</h2>
<p>ICT - Secure (under using the following tools like Tor; i2p; FreeNet; PGP; S/MIME and for save money transaction we use BITCOIN with a integrated User Interface to create necessaries accounts and security keys) protects you by bouncing your communications around a
          distributed network of relays run by volunteers all around
          the world: it prevents somebody watching your Internet
          connection from learning what sites you visit, and it prevents
          the sites you visit from learning your physical location. </p>

<p>We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right that must be

organisations or even institutions. We need to install a linux Clusters to improve performance and availability over that of a single computer, while typically being much more cost-effective than single computers of comparable speed or availability and make sure all data are encrypted and secure.
We have to develop a very easy User Interface, which gives the facility to install and configure all parts of the system. During the installation process all necessary programs will be installed and configured. We want make sure that there is no need for any manual maintenance and or updates/upgrades, because it's very big need  to be always ""updated"" to make sure all security and other issues are solved and the system is up to date. Any further development will be integrated with out any action.We use only the most secure implementations of AES, RSA, along with OpenPGP. Furthermore, all of the cryptographic libraries we use are open source. By using open source libraries, we can guarantee that none of the encryption tools we are using have clandestinely built in back doors. We are constantly consulting security experts including IT scientists


What will the founds be used for?



The first $80,000 will give us enough money to buy and host the servers we need to support all users currently on our waiting list. With some luck, it will be enough for us to get the UI out of beta. This will allow us to introduce paid accounts with additional storage after which the project can be self-sustaining.",8.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>FLI
Charge is comprised of charging pads called FLIways and FLI Charge-enabled devices. FLIways
are plugged into the wall and send power to “swimlanes”
on their surface. The FLIway
constantly monitors the flow of electricity and immediately halts power
transfer if an unapproved object, like liquid, is detected. FLI Charge-enabled devices are
embedded with the FLImod, which is a smart chip that is
connected to four contact points.</p>

<p>Power flows from the swimlanes, through the FLImod and then on to your device. The smart chip ensures that the optimal amount of electricity is sent to your device and the geometric relationship between the contact points and swimlanes ensures that the FLImod will remain in contact with at least one positive and one negative swimlane, regardless of the device’s position or orientation on the FLIway, guaranteeing a continuous charge.</p>

<span>FEATURES AND TECHNICAL</span>
<details>
<summary><b>Does FLI Charge need batteries?</b></summary>
<p style=""padding-left:18px;padding-top:10px;"">No batteries are needed to use FLI Charge. The FLIway 40 uses a standard power adapter (included) to plug into the wall. FLI Charge’s power adapter plug supports 110v and 200v, meaning it is compatible with power outlets in every country around the world with just a socket converter.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>How does FLI Charge’s conductive power transfer work? </b></summary>
<p style=""padding-left:18px;padding-top:10px;"">Conductive Power transfer occurs when two conductive objects,
	like metal, make contact.  Electrical current flows freely between the two
	conductors while electrical current is present. FLI Charge pads are connected
	to a power source that sends electrical current to the conductive surface of
	the pads. FLI Charge-enabled mobile devices have a FLImod that is
	directly tied into the device's’ power source. When the FLImod makes contact
	with the surface of the pad, power is transferred from the pad, through the FLImod, to the
	mobile device.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>How fast will FLI Charge charge my phone?</b></summary>
<p style=""padding-left:18px;padding-top:10px;"">FLI Charge is nearly 100% efficient and will charge your smartphone or other mobile device as fast as plugging into the wall.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Where on the FLIway 40 should I place my phone?</b></summary>
<p style=""padding-left:18px;padding-top:10px;"">One of the greatest benefits of FLI Charge, as compared to other wireless charging technologies, is that you can place your phone anywhere on the pad, in any orientation.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Will the FLIcase protect my phone?</b> </summary>
<p style=""padding-left:18px;padding-top:10px;"">FLIcases are made of high grade ABS material and will protect your phone from everyday bumps and drops.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>How many phones and other mobile devices can I charge at the same time?</b></summary>
<p style=""padding-left:18px;padding-top:10px;"">The number of devices that you can charge simultaneously on a single FLIway 40 depends on two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<b>The size of the devices:</b> The FLIway 40 has enough surface area to fit three smartphones or 12+ FLIcubes/FLIcoins.</li>
<li><p><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>The devices’ cumulative power requirements:</b> Mobile devices charge at varying power levels or wattages. If the cumulative wattage of the devices connected to a single FLIway 40 exceeds 40 watts, the FLIway 40 will halt power transfer until enough devices are removed such that the total power requirement drops below 40 watts. To give you an idea of how much power different kinds of devices require, the table below has approximate wattages for commonly used devices:</span></p></li>
</ol>
<table style=""font-size: 16px;"">

</table>
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Does FLI Charge work internationally?</b></summary>
<p style=""padding-left:18px;padding-top:10px;"">Yes. We have sourced type A, C, G and I wall
	plugs that are compatible with the FLIway 40. A list of plug types by country
	can be found <a href=""http://www.worldstandards.eu/electricity/plug-voltage-by-country/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>here</span></a>. If the wall plugs used in your country does not
	include type A, C, G or I, you will need to purchase an outlet converter in
	order for the FLIway 40 to work.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Will the FLIcase block access to the headphone port?</b></summary>
<p style=""padding-left:18px;padding-top:10px;"">We have designed the FLIcase to have as small a bottom as possible. Although most headphones are able to plug in without problem, we have included a jumper cable that attaches to your headphones, just in case.</p>

</details>
<details>
<summary><b>Will using FLI Charge for too long harm my battery?</b></summary>
<p style=""padding-left:18px;padding-top:10px;"">No. It is a common misconception that mobile devices can “overcharge”. Power management is typically controlled by the mobile device, making sure that overcharging isn’t possible. Therefore leaving devices charging on the FLIway 40 won’t harm them, it will just ensure they are charged and ready to use.</p>
</details>
<details>
<summary><b>What happens if it gets wet?</b></summary>
<p style=""padding-left:18px;padding-top:10px;"">The FLI Charge software has a built in safety mechanism that will detect any foreign object on the surface and instantly turn off and quickly restart when the object is removed.  The system is water resistant. If it gets wet, water should be removed as soon as possible and it should be allowed to dry completely.</p>

In today’s modern world, running out of power is a huge problem.
Over the years our tools have evolved, but the way we power them has not changed
in decades. It’s time we end cord hell and the never-ending quest for more
power outlets.



Live
life on the FLI and never worry about searching for outlets or charging cables
again! Charge your mobile devices quickly and conveniently using our charging
pads, smartphone cases and universal adaptors.















ReVive is a low cost, easy to install, FLIway charging pad for your car that provides 36-watts of power, which is significantly more than any other in-car wireless charging solution on the market today.
ReVive comes with all of the other added benefits of FLI Charge’s technology including freedom of positioning, charging speeds as fast as plugging in and no additional radiation.
ReVive can be installed in virtually any type of transportation vehicle including cars, trucks, RVs, and boats, providing fast, powerful and easy to use wireless charging for smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices.

ReVive was designed in conjunction with our partner, MITO Corp. MITO is a leading distributor of aftermarket products to the transportation industry.
At the end of the campaign, MITO will work with backers to pair them up with a professional installer at one of the more than 9,000 car dealerships in the MITO network.
A typical installation takes about 20-30 minutes and should cost between $30-60 depending on the dealer and car model.       

















FLI
Charge is comprised of charging pads called FLIways and FLI Charge-enabled devices. FLIways
are plugged into the wall and send power to “swimlanes”
on their surface. The FLIway
constantly monitors the flow of electricity and immediately halts power
transfer if an unapproved object, like liquid, is detected. FLI Charge-enabled devices are
embedded with the FLImod, which is a smart chip that is
connected to four contact points.


The FLIcase makes charging your smartphone a complete afterthought.
Available for: Apple iPhone 6, 6s, 6 Plus & 6s Plus | Samsung Galaxy S6, S6 edge, S7 & S7 edge





The FLIcube charges any USB device optimally and as fast as plugging into an outlet.






The FLIcoin’s built-in microUSB or Lightning connector makes it easy to charge any device on the go.


 

Power flows from the swimlanes, through the FLImod and then on to your device. The smart chip ensures that the optimal amount of electricity is sent to your device and the geometric relationship between the contact points and swimlanes ensures that the FLImod will remain in contact with at least one positive and one negative swimlane, regardless of the device’s position or orientation on the FLIway, guaranteeing a continuous charge.




FLI Charge works with any USB powered device including smartphones, tablets, e-readers, Bluetooth speakers, drones, video game controllers, cameras, GoPros, smartwatches, fitness trackers and more! FLI Charge is best when you have pads in the places you spend the majority of your time.






FLI Charge transforms the way you power your life, making it easy to keep all your devices at maximum power. Other wireless charging solutions, which for the most part use Qi inductive technology, are typically slow and fickle, and are limited to smaller devices. FLI Charge’s technology is powerful and fast - able to charge larger devices such as tablets, cameras and drones.













FLI Charge partnered with Intelligent Product Solutions (IPS), a world leading product development company, to design the look and feel as well as assist in preparing the product family for manufacturing. IPS’ 110+ person team has extensive experience across each and every stage of the product design and manufacturing process. Its reputation is unquestionable and reinforces our confidence in delivering beautiful and beautifully made products to market.

Throughout the design process we remained conscientious of our products’ user experiences as well as their aesthetic qualities, both individually and as a family. It was imperative that the aesthetic of our products be matched only by the convenience of our technology.









Beyond asking our customers to have faith in the promise of FLI Charge’s technology, we are asking for space in their pockets and real estate in their homes; as such, we strived not only to develop tools to enhance productivity, but pieces of art that fit seamlessly into your life.











FLI Charge is not just another gadget - we are
bringing a new and better standard of living to the world. We have tremendous
aspirations and many exciting projects brewing, but none of these will ever
happen without your help.
We are certain that FLI Charge is without a
doubt the most powerful, fastest charging, easiest to use, and safest wireless
charging solution on the market. We have finalized the prototypes and now we
need that last push to bring the product to you as quickly as we can.

We would love for you to join our community and
bring wireless charging into our daily lives. We can’t wait for you to try out
FLI Charge and live life on the FLI!

The devices’ cumulative power requirements: Mobile devices charge at varying power levels or wattages. If the cumulative wattage of the devices connected to a single FLIway 40 exceeds 40 watts, the FLIway 40 will halt power transfer until enough devices are removed such that the total power requirement drops below 40 watts. To give you an idea of how much power different kinds of devices require, the table below has approximate wattages for commonly used devices:




Smartphones
5-10 watts


Tablets
12-15 watts


Bluetooth Speakers
5 watts


Smartwatches & Fitness Trackers
1-2 watts


Cameras
5 watts





Does FLI Charge work internationally?
Yes. We have sourced type A, C, G and I wall
	plugs that are compatible with the FLIway 40. A list of plug types by country
	can be found here. If the wall plugs used in your country does not
	include type A, C, G or I, you will need to purchase an outlet converter in
	order for the FLIway 40 to work.


Will the FLIcase block access to the headphone port?
We have designed the FLIcase to have as small a bottom as possible. Although most headphones are able to plug in without problem, we have included a jumper cable that attaches to your headphones, just in case.


SAFETY & LEGAL

Are FLI Charge’s technologies protected with Intellectual Property?
Yes. FLI Charge has granted patents covering the core technology as well as pending patent applications. FLI Charge is continuously expanding it’s patent portfolio.


Will using FLI Charge for too long harm my battery?
No. It is a common misconception that mobile devices can “overcharge”. Power management is typically controlled by the mobile device, making sure that overcharging isn’t possible. Therefore leaving devices charging on the FLIway 40 won’t harm them, it will just ensure they are charged and ready to use.


What happens if it gets wet?
The FLI Charge software has a built in safety mechanism that will detect any foreign object on the surface and instantly turn off and quickly restart when the object is removed.  The system is water resistant. If it gets wet, water should be removed as soon as possible and it should be allowed to dry completely.


Is FLI Charge safe?
Using FLI Charge is as safe as plugging into a wall outlet. Unlike other wireless charging systems, FLI Charge emits no additional radiation so you don’t have to worry about potentially harming yourself or those around you. Furthermore, the FLIway 40 has a built in control system that constantly monitors and immediately halts power transfer if an unapproved object, such as liquid, touches the surface of the pad.


What certifications does FLI Charge and its products have?
FLI Charge products are FCC and CE approved and
	conform to ROHS standards.",72.0,2,"1 Campaign

<p>I came up with Seismic Audio about a year ago, and I never had an opportunity to make it fully come to life. I did a bunch of work on it.

<p><strong><em>We all know people that ride motorcycles and bicycles with headphones in. They are a danger to themselves and others. This product gives them a new and different choice.  </em></strong></p>

<p>The device is made out of thick, flexible and durable rubber so it conforms to any helmet. Just attach it, pair it, and you are good to go.</p>
<p>I have demonstrated it with about 35 people in different fields and environments, (bicyclists, motorcyclists, construction workers, power plant engineers, snowboarders) and every time I did, their reactions were the same.

 a  special Indiegogo only referral program for this project.

 you print a HyperPhoto, we'll include a very small watermark in the 
bottom right hand corner of the photo to indicate that this is an 
Augmented Reality photo. That way you won't have to memorize which of 
your photos have AR and which ones don't. We'll also give you the option
 to turn this watermark off if you really don't want it.LifePrint lets you seamlessly share real physical photos instantly all over the world.

(NOTE: We have fielded inquiries regarding our decision NOT to accept Paypal contributions and hopefully this explains it.  There were TWO factors used in our decision:


Paypal policies are not the greatest when it comes to digital transactions
More of your contributions actually go to funding the project and not to Paypal fees ($0.91 to $0.96 of every dollar goes to the project without Paypal compared to $0.57 to $0.62 of every dollar goes to the project with Paypal)

We apologize for the inconvenience.  We aware you may have concerns using Indiegogo's debit/credit card processing which we want to assure everyone that it is very secure.  As long as the address bar on the browser shows ""https:"" before the indiegogo url, the page is secure for providing your personal & debit/credit card information. Please keep in mind that if you DO NOT use this campaign to get the early bird pricing you will pay retail prices (up to $497US) for Pressinar when it is released on the website.  So take advantage NOW before this campaign ends.  Hopefully this answers everyone's concerns.)",1.0,0,"2 Campaigns

The above video is from our demo day at SXSW. Five days after our demo, our product changed slightly. The point of this video is to give you a feel about who we are and glimpse at what we're building.
Our Story
Heman and Kyle met on the campus of the University of Central Florida in 2009. In 2012 they began building Doccaster, an analytics dashboard for event organizers. After testing Doccaster in a few events, the pair saw they were onto something special. In November, Doccaster was selected as 1 of 8 companies to participate in the #3 technology accelerator program in the nation, Dreamit Ventures. Two weeks later, they quit their jobs, packed their belongs into 4 small bags and headed to Austin Texas. While in Austin, the two lived in a rented room, worked late every night and turned living extremely cheap into a science while they continued building their business over the next three months.
What is Doccaster
Event organizers and planners need data to enhance and showcase their event's value to exhibitors, sponsors and attendees. Doccaster gives them data on activities, such as attendee engagement and exhibitor lead generation, by grabbing it from our web-based app called EventLocker.me. EventLocker offers event attendee's and exhibitor's:


Attendee Check-in and Networking List



Event Scheduling



Unlimited Do-it-Yourself File-Sharing



Qualified Lead Generation



Private Communication



Access From Any Mobile Device without Downloading

Throughout the life of an event, we pull attendee and exhibitor activities right into the organizers dashboard, so they can spot trends and opportunities to enhance and showcase their event.
The Bridge
Now that the program is over, our goal is to complete our fundraising and continue building key features which'll allow us to secure relationships, win deals and generate revenue. These activities require time, so we're looking build a bridge. This bridge will allow us to do the following:


Basic Living Stipend - We're going to pay ourselves a very small stipend over the next 3 months.

All remaining funds will go into the following areas:


Design Work (Front End Development) - Our target customers, event organizers, are predominantly women. Women are heavily designed focused and at the moment, our system looks like it was designed by two guys with zero style.



Backend Help – Time is not a friend of the tech startup, so we need to purchase some additional development hours to assist us in pumping out a few key features. 

Perks
Event analytics is not sexy. We're not a cool music app, a robot making machine or a t-shirt with holograms on it. Doccaster is plain and simple big data that allows organizers to see what's going on at their event so they can get attract more attendees, exhibitors and sponsors. Here are our perks:


Fern Creek Coding Project - We're a company of givers. We founded the Fern Creek Project in 2012 to teach disadvantage elementary school children how to code. We believe coding is the technology version of basketball - it's cheap to setup, easy to teach, and provides a pathway to great opportunity. We're donating 35% of every dollar we raise to the Fern Creek Elementary School Foundation in Orlando Florida, so they can buy computers for the classrooms.

<p>Q: Does JUSE really work?</p>
<p>A: Yes JUSE really works! Solar technology
has been around for 30+ years. What makes JUSE able to deliver on perpetual
power is it’s ability to efficiently take in any light source and convert it to
energy. </p>
<p>Q: Does JUSE work without the sun?</p>
<p>A: JUSE can work under low light
conditions. For example typical office lights. It does take more time to charge
the nano battery. Typical time would range fro 6-8hrs in a typical office
environment. JUSE will NOT work if you live in a cave and are not exposed to
any light through out the day.</p>
<p>Q: How long does it take for the SUN to
charge JUSE?</p>
<p>A: Depending on what time of the day,
it typically take about 2hrs of sun light to charge JUSE to 75%. This is all
you will need to power your phone throughout the day. Combine outdoor light
with indoor light and you will have perpetual power for the whole day.</p>
<p>Q: Do I need to think about charging?</p>
<p>A: NO. JUSE is designed as a passive device.
Simply put your JUSE case on your phone and go about your every day life. *JUSE
does need to see light!… If your phone is in your pant pocket or purse
for 24hrs or more, with no access to light, JUSE will not perform the way it was meant to. </p>Q: What type of battery do you use?</div><div>A: Our batteries are made from Lithium Ion Silicon Graphene and have a gravimetric weight of 400-500 Wh/kg.

<p>We are looking to raise as much as we can to help my uncle, Andy, who was in a horrific car accident on July 18. Early in the morning he overcorrected his vehicle, rolled and was trapped in his vehicle as it started on fire. There was thankfully someone in the area that witnessed the accident and was able to pull him out of his burning vehicle and save his life. Now he is in the hospital undergoing several surgeries from his accident and is looking like a long road ahead of him. </p>
<p>Andy is an amazing Father of 3, uncle, friend, grandfather of 2 and one on the way, and so much more. He would give anyone the last dime he had to his name or the shirt off his back regardless of the situation. He is a hard working man who has owned his own construction business for as long as I know. I am hoping that people are willing to help with any costs of the medical to show him how loved he truly is by more than just his family and give him the motivation to keep striving forward in his recovery process. </p>
<p>All of the funds raised will go to medical bills for Andy to take care of a little of the financial burden that has been on his family at this time. </p>
<p>Any amount of money will help as well as prayers are also requested at this time. Andy is in very bad shape, but already so far he has fought a hard battle and is moving forward. </p>

<br/><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>As it is 3 different projects combined in one, the manufacturing costs are higher. Thus the 3000 pounds will allow a good quantity of boards to be produced to make them affordable price.</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>These 3 little boards will make your day to day prototyping simpler easier and faster. If you never tried using SMD components this is the best place to start, The money made from this campaign will go towards bringing you more amazing project (and we have few in prototype stages)</p>
<ul></ul>
</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>We already had few successful crowd-funding campaigns. And learned a lot about design and manufacturing. The boards are in the final stage. And there are not any more designed changes planed. Thus there will not be any design problems. </p>
<p>The roll out plan is flowing:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>30 days  For the campaigned to run<br/>
</li>

 After couple successful Kickstarter campaigns we come to Indiegogo.  Bringing to you 3 types of prototyping boards.


SMD prototyping - solder those tiny components you always wanted to try
Breadboard Style PCB - move your breadboard creation to permanent place 
Arduino Prototype Shield - make your own custom Arduino compatible shield

You can pledge to to get 3 of the same kind of one of each. Or a bunch of them...   

SMD Prototyping Board






QFN - up to 64pins
SOIC -  28 pin
SOIP - 48 pin
DFN - 14pin
1206 size Capacitors, Resistors and LED's x 33
Pushbuttons
SOT-233
SOT23-6
SMA Diodes
Mini USB
Arduino and Raspberry PI headers or use them from DIP components 








Breadboard PCB



Size of a half size breadboard
370 holes
familiar to the heart design
mounting holes
rounded edges






Arduino Protoshield





Arduino R3 compatible
ISCP header 
Support for DIP IC
Reset and push buttons
LEDs
Stackable headers - stack as high as you need
Power and Ground rails - plenty Ground and 5V pins





What We Need & What You Get As it is 3 different projects combined in one, the manufacturing costs are higher. Thus the 3000 pounds will allow a good quantity of boards to be produced to make them affordable price.

  The Impact These 3 little boards will make your day to day prototyping simpler easier and faster. If you never tried using SMD components this is the best place to start, The money made from this campaign will go towards bringing you more amazing project (and we have few in prototype stages)

  Risks & Challenges We already had few successful crowd-funding campaigns. And learned a lot about design and manufacturing. The boards are in the final stage. And there are not any more designed changes planed. Thus there will not be any design problems. 
The roll out plan is flowing:


30 days  For the campaigned to run

15-20 days for the money from backers to get to us
5-7 days to transfer money to the manufacturers 
2-3 day shipping 
3-7 days pack-edge preparation and shipping out 
2 days shipping time for order within UK
5-7 days for the rest of the world
Total between 32 to 46 days from the end of the campaign to the day you can start prototyping.


  Other Ways You Can Help We know there are loads of friends that you have who would love to get their hands of these great prototyping boards. So please share it with your friends and colleagues to make this project a success.

	We all use our smartphones a lot these days, and the uses for them keep growing and growing.  For my part, I'm a big outdoors person, and use my smartphone for GPS while sailing or hiking - but okay, I confess that I also stream films to my smartphone in bed when It's late and I can't fall asleep. 
<p></p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.6em; padding-left: 10px; font-size: 1.1em;"">
	Whether we're watching the news at breakfast, reading a recipe while we cook, loads of the things we do with our smartphones require us to hold it up in front of us, or find a place to lean it.  </p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.6em; padding-left: 10px; font-size: 1.1em;"">
	When we take the train, plane or bus, arms get tired trying to hold the phone up at the right viewing distance and angle, especially if there's a coffee in one hand, and a sandwich on our lap.  It would be cool if we could hang the phone off the seat in front, or make it stay on an arm or knee.
</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.6em; padding-left: 10px; font-size: 1.1em;"">
	How about trying to make videos or ""selfies""?  An adjustable
	stand which can stay ANYWHERE would be very handy.
</p>
<p>

<p style=""line-height: 1.6em; padding-left: 10px; font-size: 1.1em;"">
	Trying to get dinner on the table?  An impatient three-year-old? Imagine
	putting Bugs Bunny on the phone, on the table, in a secure stand
	where little eyes can see it, but little hands won't drop it on the floor.  Peace of mind.  Replacement screens are expensive!</p>
<p style=""width: 550px; height: 67px; line-height: 1.6em; padding-left: 10px; font-size: 1.1em;"">
	What if we are driving a car or a truck with no hands-free kit? No SatNav or GPS?  The smart<strong>BandStand</strong>™ will stay on the dashboard, or hang from the AC vent.  Now that's really handy!
</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.6em; padding-left: 10px; font-size: 1.1em;"">
	When we use smartphone GPS for hiking, fishing or sailing, we
	worry about dropping it in water or mud while trying to
	dig it out of a jacket pocket with cold or wet hands.
Why not wear it on an arm, safe and usable?</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.6em; padding-left: 10px; font-size: 1.1em;"">
	By the way, where should it go when we have no pockets - like
	when out jogging, or working in the garden in warm weather?
</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.6em; padding-left: 10px; font-size: 1.1em;"">
	People have devised smartphone stands already, and people have devised
	smartphone armbands, too. What if we could combine these in one
	device?
</p>
<p style=""line-height: 1.6em; padding-left: 10px; font-size: 1.1em;"">
	Smartwatches have come on the scene, and can be used hands-free, but a smartwatch isn’t the same as having your own phone!

<p></p><p></p></div>","We all use our smartphones a lot these days, and the uses for them keep growing and growing.  For my part, I'm a big outdoors person, and use my smartphone for GPS while sailing or hiking - but okay, I confess that I also stream films to my smartphone in bed when It's late and I can't fall asleep. 


	Whether we're watching the news at breakfast, reading a recipe while we cook, loads of the things we do with our smartphones require us to hold it up in front of us, or find a place to lean it.  

	When we take the train, plane or bus, arms get tired trying to hold the phone up at the right viewing distance and angle, especially if there's a coffee in one hand, and a sandwich on our lap.  It would be cool if we could hang the phone off the seat in front, or make it stay on an arm or knee.


	How about trying to make videos or ""selfies""?  An adjustable
	stand which can stay ANYWHERE would be very handy.




	Trying to get dinner on the table?  An impatient three-year-old? Imagine
	putting Bugs Bunny on the phone, on the table, in a secure stand
	where little eyes can see it, but little hands won't drop it on the floor.  Peace of mind.  Replacement screens are expensive!

	What if we are driving a car or a truck with no hands-free kit? No SatNav or GPS?  The smartBandStand™ will stay on the dashboard, or hang from the AC vent.  Now that's really handy!


	When we use smartphone GPS for hiking, fishing or sailing, we
	worry about dropping it in water or mud while trying to
	dig it out of a jacket pocket with cold or wet hands.
Why not wear it on an arm, safe and usable?

	By the way, where should it go when we have no pockets - like
	when out jogging, or working in the garden in warm weather?


	People have devised smartphone stands already, and people have devised
	smartphone armbands, too. What if we could combine these in one
	device?


	Smartwatches have come on the scene, and can be used hands-free, but a smartwatch isn’t the same as having your own phone!

 
   

	made a carrying band which will let me use my phone
	while it's on my arm or wrist?  If they did, I wouldn't need
	to buy a smartwatch, or a rubber/plastic arm band
	(which makes it very hard to get the phone out when it rings).

 


    made a good-looking, rugged, well-designed
	all-in-one device to help us with our smartphones in almost any
	situation?  Filming, viewing, reading?  With quickly
	interchangeable urban or outdoor cases?

 


made a stand/armband which lets me remove or replace
	the smartphone in one simple movement, instead of needing to pull it
out of a pocket, or unhook it from clips, clamps, screws, or
	rubber arms?

 

 
 What's in it for you?Three products in one:1. Impact-resistant smartphone case with connector button2. Armband with Velcro™ or bungee hook closure3. A fully-adjustable stand with tilt-screen featureEven without the super-perks available only to Indiegogo supporters, the smartBandStand™ represents amazingly good value.Why buy three separate products when you can have them in one great-looking device?  A smartBandStand™ just makes good sense!Be the first to get your hands on a smartBandStand™ and make your smartphone do more for you every day!You get this awesome new product, at a huge pre-order discount.What do I do NOW?1. For a simple pre-order of the smartBandStand™ click the ""Bronze Token"".    (or choose your own perk!)2. Wait for confirmation email (usually within 24 hours)3. Reply to confirmation email with:    Choice of colour - black, white or red     (unless you choose a custom colour perk!)            Your closure preference (Velcro™ or bungee type)    The exact type of smartphone you own so we can send the correct case!  Supported Models:  IPhone 4  IPhone 4S  IPhone 5  iPhone 5S  iPhone 5C  Samsung S3  Samsung S4  Samsung S3 Mini  Samsung S4 Mini  HTC One  HTC One Mini  LG G2No problem! We also make the smartBandStand Button™, which can be attached permanently to the back of most smartphone cases. It is extremely low profile, and comes in three colours (black, white and red).Just let us know what you decide when you are specifying colour and strap preference.Note: Our impact resistant cases are compatible with flip cover smartphones.Thinking of changing smartphones soon? Nothing to worry about. If you change smartphones between now and 1 September 2014, just drop us an email with your order reference number, and we will update your case choice!Alternatively, choose a perk which includes a replacement case. There is no time limit for redeeming your second case - subject only to the condition that your replacement case is for one of the ""Top 12"" selling smartphones at the time of claiming.Replacement cases will be shipped within 48 hours of order receipt.Please bear in mind that smartBandStand™ cases may be purchased separately to the smartBandStand™ itself at any time once manufacture has begun. All subsequent case products which we make (heavy-duty/waterproof/dust-proof/shock-proof) will remain fully compatible with the smartBandStand™.Replacement case shipping costs ARE INCLUDED as part of the perk.When you receive your confirmation of order email, don't forget to reply with your choice of colour (black, white, or red).  Please also specify if you would like matching closure straps, as mixing and matching is allowed!PLEASE bear in mind that your supporter's contribution does not include shipping cost!

Look who's talking! Prototyping and Manufacture
	After 20 months and a lot of sweat and hard work, we're ready to move this idea beyond concept and sketches, CAD rendering, prototyping, patent filing and business execution plan.  This is a hugely exciting time.We're looking for YOUR support, and here is what crowdfunders will help us do:We need to complete the tooling for cases for all the leading brands of smartphone. That is why our funding goal is larger than some; it's like making over a dozen separate products.We want to follow our debut product with our impact, dust, and water-resistant case - the smartLocker™. This will be the premier-level case with a ""smartBandStand Button™"" for attaching to the smartBandStand™.
We need to get smartbandstand.com to act as our worldwide sales portal. Great web design is a lot of work, and we think this device warrants the best.We need to do proper branding and packaging design work. We need to get this packaging made. It must be eco-friendly, and still look as good as what's inside it.Our local toolmaker/machinist/injection moulder must make and assemble the first 5000 smartBandStands™.The worldwide distribution/fulfilment system must be rock-solid.Most of all, only your help will make all of this happen!
  

	Now for the breakdown...this is how your support will make it all happen:


 



Phase 2 will require $209,000, and will comprise:
	

		further IP protection work;
	

		branding, logo and packaging design;
	

		web portal design;
	

		final pre-tooling prototyping of ancillary products;
	

		drawing-up of manufacture, assembly, packaging and distribution licence contracts;
	

		fulfilment of the first 5000 unit orders taken via crowd-sourced investment website Indiegogo.
	
 


$209,000 is a lot of money, and would get this project off to a flying start  Life would be much easier if this level of support arrived up front – no doubt about it.  But let's look at how this project will happen no matter what!
 
 



	Our absolute baseline is to honour our commitment to Indiegogo funders. 5000 units with standard case can be made, assembled, and plain-packaged for this amount of money. This amount would also allow us to produce soft-tooling for the top-twelve-selling smartphones. 
	
	Having 5000 happy smartBandStand™ owners out there in the world is one heck of a powerful marketing tool. 5000 people committed to the product also makes it a lot easier to get other investors on board, so the shortfall becomes less short!

 
 



	What if we raised around 50% of our ideal target? $100,000 could complete all web shop design, retail packaging and hard-tooling work for smartBandStands™ with standard cases for the top-twelve-selling smartphones. This also means the product would exist beyond our Indiegogo supporters, and be available for sale worldwide on smartbandstand.com

 
 



	This amount would allow us to produce a full range of colours. We would also be able to work full-time on research and development of our water, dust and shockproof smartLocker™ cases for the smartBandStand™.

 
 



	This amount of money allows us to finance the digital marketing campaign which we believe will get our product seen worldwide.

 
 

	If we raise less than the amount necessary to honour our commitments to Indiegogo supporters, we will approach investors for matching funds.


During our campaign, we will gladly answer any queries relating to our costing and funding allocation. Our Facebook and Twitter pages will remain ""live"" throughout the campaign for this purpose. Every contributor has a stake in our success or failure, and their questions are hugely important to us.

<span style=""background-color: initial;"">The idea came to me accidently. While I was doing the grocery shopping, I saw an     old lady who was selling baby hats and slippers made by her. They were hand-made yarn knitted and I thought it would be cool to have a hand-made knitted phone case,just because no one has that kind of phone case and it will look just amazing.</span><br/><p></p>
<p><br/></p>
<span style=""text-align: center;""><a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-phone-sweaters/contributions/new?perk_id=3356813#/contribute"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><b>Select The Ladybug Phone Case Perk!

<p>So I ordered the old
lady to make me a phone case. And this is how all have started. To be honest
the first case was just awful…but then came the second one and then the third
and so on. Finally I had what I wanted. While we worked together I was getting to know her and she once told me that she doesn’t have a job and selling baby hand-made clothing is the only what she does for living is only. <br/></p>

<br/><div>Then I came up with the idea to order her enough phone cases so she can get an income she can live with. I wish the knitting  became her full-time job. The problem seems to be that Katya is not the only one in that kind of situation- there are a lot of old ladies just like Katya who don’t have any income. But here is the solution- they also can knit…</div>

<br/>
</div>
<div>So basically that’s all about- to hire as many as possible old ladies who can knit. I know it sounds crazy, but here in Bulgaria this is a huge problem- there are a lot of old people who are not old enough to be retired so they can get a pension and they don’t work either because nobody wants to hire them. My goal is not to hire all the old people in Bulgaria who don’t take any income, of course this is impossible and pointless. The main goal is to hire enough capable old ladies so they can get paid, help their families and feel useful.<br/><div>

<br/><br/><p></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I don’t need a lot of money to achieve the campaign’s goals at
this point and that’s why the budget is not huge. We need money to buy supplies
such as yarn, needles, to make a well-looking website and the most important-
to hire more women who are good at knitting and to pay them fair so they can be
financially independant. We have yarn and needles, but we need to buy new and
more supply and tools, to try new types of yarn to create new designs with more
colors and uniqueness. </span><br/></p>

The idea came to me accidently. While I was doing the grocery shopping, I saw an     old lady who was selling baby hats and slippers made by her. They were hand-made yarn knitted and I thought it would be cool to have a hand-made knitted phone case,just because no one has that kind of phone case and it will look just amazing.

Select The Ladybug Phone Case Perk! FREE SHIPPING WORLDWIDE! 
So I ordered the old
lady to make me a phone case. And this is how all have started. To be honest
the first case was just awful…but then came the second one and then the third
and so on. Finally I had what I wanted. While we worked together I was getting to know her and she once told me that she doesn’t have a job and selling baby hand-made clothing is the only what she does for living is only. 

Select The Panda Phone Case Perk! FREE SHIPPING WORLDWIDE! 

Then I came up with the idea to order her enough phone cases so she can get an income she can live with. I wish the knitting  became her full-time job. The problem seems to be that Katya is not the only one in that kind of situation- there are a lot of old ladies just like Katya who don’t have any income. But here is the solution- they also can knit…
 Select The Minion Phone Case Perk! FREE SHIPPING WORLDWIDE! 



So basically that’s all about- to hire as many as possible old ladies who can knit. I know it sounds crazy, but here in Bulgaria this is a huge problem- there are a lot of old people who are not old enough to be retired so they can get a pension and they don’t work either because nobody wants to hire them. My goal is not to hire all the old people in Bulgaria who don’t take any income, of course this is impossible and pointless. The main goal is to hire enough capable old ladies so they can get paid, help their families and feel useful.



I don’t need a lot of money to achieve the campaign’s goals at
this point and that’s why the budget is not huge. We need money to buy supplies
such as yarn, needles, to make a well-looking website and the most important-
to hire more women who are good at knitting and to pay them fair so they can be
financially independant. We have yarn and needles, but we need to buy new and
more supply and tools, to try new types of yarn to create new designs with more
colors and uniqueness. 


      The Greatest challenge is to find and hire people who are in need but also         capable of doing the Phone Sweaters products. The more women we hire the more we produce, but we need to sell what we are producing. So we need to build a website, an Etsy store, to find our target group and to sell to them so we can create a sustainable business model.

<h1><b>Features
@A Glance</b></h1>
<p><b>Remark:</b> When integrating Faxing, Printing &amp;
  Scanning, we isolate those activities to preserve Mobile+ performance in par
  with the competition. In other words, those extra functionalities do not
  impact the device performance.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p><b>Bluetooth</b></p>
<p>At manufacturing
  time, Mobile+ will be fitted with the latest Bluetooth technology available.
  As you may already be aware, 4.0 is already being implemented in new devices.
  We are watching this technology closely to integrate the latest into Mobile+</p>
<p><b>Wifi</b></p>
<p>One of the best
  things that has happened to communication. At InterNotes Mobile, we’re all
  about “Cutting the Cord”. Already in use is 802.11n. Don’t worry if those
  numbers don’t ring any bell. Suffice to know that 802.11n gives your Wifi
  device a much longer range of communication with the source. We are watching
  this technology closely to integrate the latest into Mobile+</p>
<p><b>3G/4G/LTE</b></p>
<p>Look to your
  cellphone provider for guidance on this. This is one aspect of communication
  we have no say on. We simply integrate it into Mobile+. </p>
<p><b>Faxing</b></p>
<p>We don’t have to
  explain faxing to you. One neat thing about using Mobile+ to fax is how
  original it looks to the recipient; no more ink smudge, missing word or
  letter. Your clients and customers will love receiving faxes from you. Remind
  them you are using Mobile+</p>
<p><b>Printing</b></p>
<p>We don’t have to
  explain printing to you.</p>
<p>Well, we do.</p>
<p>We integrate into
  Mobile+ inkless technology that enables printing without the fuss; no more
  running out of ink, no more paper jam (the possibility of that happening is 1
  in a million).</p>
<p><b>Scanning</b></p>
<p>We don’t have to
  explain scanning to you, except that we place the scanner near the exit
  point, making it virtually impossible to have any issue. </p>
<p><b>Camera/Video</b></p>
<p>Camera, Light,
  Action or is it the other way around. Whichever you decide, you’ll find snapping
  pictures with a 39MP camera one of the best experience of your photographic
  career. And if you’re into video, you can keep your distance and still get in
  on the action. When you turn the video feature ON, no event is too far. Your
  eyes may not catch the details, our camera will. In those times when you wish
  you could be close enough to capture a crime in progress, Mobile+ will come
  to the rescue. How about spying on your boyfriend? Well, we are completely
  against that. Hmm!</p>
<p><b>Security</b></p>
<p>Everyone mentions
  security as a priority; well, we don’t simply mention it. We implement it.
  There is no upside for anyone to steal your Mobile+. Once the security is
  active, no one can make use of your tablet. Even at the point when a phone
  number is provided to call to have Mobile+ unlocked, the “thief” would also
  need your personal code (generated at time of shipment) sent to you with the
  product. Unless it’s someone who just wants to piss you off, a girlfriend
  maybe. Hmm!</p>
<p><b>Display</b></p>
<p>We are looking at
  260ppi (a resolution close to that of iPad 3 which is 264ppi) as of this
  writing but things can change. The final determination will be made at time
  of manufacturing of course, </p>
<p><b>Ports</b></p>
<p>Well, ports are
  ports. Mobile+ sports mini-USB, mini-HDMI, audio, video and any other port
  that may be deemed necessary at time of manufacturing. As usual, those ports
  will be compatible with the latest technology.</p>
<p><br/></p>

<p><b>REMARK: </b>During the campaign, you are also encouraged to submit your suggestions

site. As we finalize the schematic, improvement and/or addition may still make
way into the final product. Please, do share any idea.</p>
<p><b>UPDATE:  </b>As of the time this document is
uploaded into the site, there is only one color (silver) <b>Mobile+</b> comes in. Other colors will of course be considered at
manufacturing time.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h1><b>HOW DID IT START?</b></h1>
<p>One night, I went to bed thinking
that I needed to contribute a little bit more to society. In a vision that
night, God spoke to me:</p>
<p><b>God:</b> Michael, Michael</p>
<p><b>Me:</b> Yes Lord</p>
<p><b>God:</b> I chose you to lead the world into the technology future</p>
<p><b>Me:</b> Me Lord?</p>
<p><b>God:</b> Yes Michael, you.</p>
<p><b>Me:</b> What do I do?</p>
<p><b>God:</b> Michael, use your imagination</p>
<p>And I woke up.</p>
<p>Of course I am kidding.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I do a lot of technology consulting;
translation, I travel a lot. I cannot begin to quantify how many times I found
myself in a situation when I either needed to print a page document to be signed
by a client or scan a document to be immediately sent to headquarters for
review and approval. </p>
<p>Those situations were not isolated
or rare. So, I began to think of a more practical solution to my problem. I
lost a few contracts because I couldn’t obtain a client’s signature on the
spot. By the time I’d traveled back to the office, the client had already
changed his mind about the deal. Other times, the client would want so many
changes that would warrant a brand new meeting which didn’t always go my way. </p>
<p>Most of those meetings happened
outside the office, at a restaurant, at a concert, at the airport and even at
the park. Try to bring a printer there, or a fax. As it is probably obvious,
there were times when it was the client that would hand me a document that was
already drafted that I had to sign, in which case I would need to send a copy
immediately to my superior at the headquarters. Try finding a fax at a
restaurant or anywhere nearby while having dinner. </p>
<p>The solution was simple, to carry
those basic office equipment with me. I christened it <i>Mobile Office</i>. Think about it. What do we do mostly at the office?
Print, Scan, Fax, Email, Calls and Meetings, right? So, Mobile Office (Mobile+)
handles the printing, the scanning, the faxing and the emailing. It can even
handle some of the calling, using a headset; it’s fitted with GSM, CDMA, LTE,
WiFi. With a Skype account, a Wifi connection and a headset (if you want
privacy; otherwise, the speaker is perfect to use), you can start making calls
the day you receive Mobile+. As far as the meetings aspect of the office, I
need to have another dialog with God.</p>
<p>Below, the first images are what <b>Mobile+</b> looked like when first
conceived, bulky, heavy. Time has changed; and of course today, the second
images are rather contemporary.</p>

<br/><div>
<p><b>WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?</b></p>
<p>We are very anxious to get <b>Mobile+</b> completed and introduced to the
market; we have already taken a number of steps to make that happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>May 2012:</b> InterNotes
     Mobile applied for and was granted a provisional patent (EFS ID: 12900728;
     Application No: 61653525; Confirmation No: 9840)
</li>
<li>
<b>May 2012:</b>
     InterNotes Mobile applied for a tax ID with US Internal Revenue Service; tax ID was issued (EIN: 45-5388174)
</li>
<li>
<b>June 2013: </b>Filing
     with New York (NY) Department of State for Certificate of Corporation; one (1) billion
     shares registered along with the filing. NY State approved InterNotes
     Mobile request for Corporation status in the state of NY (DOS ID: 4377538)
</li>
<li>
<b>Ongoing:</b>
     Schematic Update, Improvement, Change, Substitution. This is where most of the time is being spent to bring scanning, printing &amp; faxing to  Mobile+ without extra weight or loss in performance.
</li>
<li>
<b>Ongoing:</b>
     Negotiation with Manufacturer; we take a one-stop shopping approach to
     minimize delay, problems and cost. The manufacturer tasked to complete the
     prototype is also responsible for manufacturing; in addition, the
     manufacturer is tasked to handle
     procurement of raw materials and any components necessary to build Mobile+
</li>
<li>
<b>TBD:</b>
      Upon final schematic, a new provisional patent will be filed to
     reflect the final drawings as well as the look of Mobile+
</li>
<li>
<b>TBD: </b>Upon
     final schematic, certification with FCC
</li>
<li>
<b>Jan-Feb 2015: </b>Finalize
     Schematic
</li>
<li>
<b>March 2015:</b> Working prototype; corrections, improvements, changes,etc..
</li>
<li>
<b>April 2015:</b>
     Fully working Prototype</li>
<li>
<b>May-June 2015:</b> Working model</li>
<li>
<b>July-Sept 2015:</b> FULL testing of all components and functionalities</li>
<li>
<b>October 2015:</b> Preparation for production and other miscellaneous<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Oct-Nov 2015:</b>
     Production begins

<h1><b>Great Plan, would it work?</b></h1>
<p>I am a very optimistic individual; I
am most inclined to believe that if one plans properly, most everything should
work. I am not however naïve to ignore problems that could creep in sometimes.
We are prepared to deal with those unfortunate situations. The one promise we
have vowed to keep is <span style=""font-weight: bold;"">NOT to release</span> a “half-baked” product. It is frustrating
sometimes that a promised date is not met; it is however most frustrating if
the promised product does not live up to its hype. </p>
<p>To minimize delays, we have
carefully selected the manufacturer that will handle all aspects of production.
I will personally monitor the manufacturer’s activity to be abreast of any
problem and address it promptly. You will be kept abreast as well; we are working
the logistics to update all interested parties either on a weekly or bi-weekly
basis.</p>
<p>Having said all that, we are fully
committed to abide by the aforementioned dates</p>

  explain faxing to you. One neat thing about using Mobile+ to fax is how
  original it looks to the recipient; no more ink smudge, missing word or
  letter. Your clients and customers will love receiving faxes from you. Remind
  them you are using Mobile+
Printing
We don’t have to
  explain printing to you.
Well, we do.
We integrate into
  Mobile+ inkless technology that enables printing without the fuss; no more
  running out of ink, no more paper jam (the possibility of that happening is 1
  in a million).
Scanning
We don’t have to
  explain scanning to you, except that we place the scanner near the exit
  point, making it virtually impossible to have any issue. 
Camera/Video
Camera, Light,
  Action or is it the other way around. Whichever you decide, you’ll find snapping
  pictures with a 39MP camera one of the best experience of your photographic
  career. And if you’re into video, you can keep your distance and still get in
  on the action. When you turn the video feature ON, no event is too far. Your
  eyes may not catch the details, our camera will. In those times when you wish
  you could be close enough to capture a crime in progress, Mobile+ will come
  to the rescue. How about spying on your boyfriend? Well, we are completely
  against that. Hmm!
Security
Everyone mentions
  security as a priority; well, we don’t simply mention it. We implement it.
  There is no upside for anyone to steal your Mobile+. Once the security is
  active, no one can make use of your tablet. Even at the point when a phone
  number is provided to call to have Mobile+ unlocked, the “thief” would also
  need your personal code (generated at time of shipment) sent to you with the
  product. Unless it’s someone who just wants to piss you off, a girlfriend
  maybe. Hmm!
Display
We are looking at
  260ppi (a resolution close to that of iPad 3 which is 264ppi) as of this
  writing but things can change. The final determination will be made at time
  of manufacturing of course, 
Ports
Well, ports are
  ports. Mobile+ sports mini-USB, mini-HDMI, audio, video and any other port
  that may be deemed necessary at time of manufacturing. As usual, those ports
  will be compatible with the latest technology.

REWARDS
  
 
 
 

Your help is needed to reach our goal; pledge of any amount is appreciated and gets us closer to reach the goal. Keep in mind
that any pledge of $50 or more today can be used as credit in the future towards the purchase of a
Mobile+ tablet when it’s available.

REMARK: During the campaign, you are also encouraged to submit your suggestions
for Mobile+ device; you can do it here on this site or submit directly
to InterNotes Mobile
site. As we finalize the schematic, improvement and/or addition may still make
way into the final product. Please, do share any idea.
UPDATE:  As of the time this document is
uploaded into the site, there is only one color (silver) Mobile+ comes in. Other colors will of course be considered at
manufacturing time.

HOW DID IT START?
One night, I went to bed thinking
that I needed to contribute a little bit more to society. In a vision that
night, God spoke to me:
God: Michael, Michael
Me: Yes Lord
God: I chose you to lead the world into the technology future
Me: Me Lord?
God: Yes Michael, you.
Me: What do I do?
God: Michael, use your imagination
And I woke up.
Of course I am kidding.

I do a lot of technology consulting;
translation, I travel a lot. I cannot begin to quantify how many times I found
myself in a situation when I either needed to print a page document to be signed
by a client or scan a document to be immediately sent to headquarters for
review and approval. 
Those situations were not isolated
or rare. So, I began to think of a more practical solution to my problem. I
lost a few contracts because I couldn’t obtain a client’s signature on the
spot. By the time I’d traveled back to the office, the client had already
changed his mind about the deal. Other times, the client would want so many
changes that would warrant a brand new meeting which didn’t always go my way. 
Most of those meetings happened
outside the office, at a restaurant, at a concert, at the airport and even at
the park. Try to bring a printer there, or a fax. As it is probably obvious,
there were times when it was the client that would hand me a document that was
already drafted that I had to sign, in which case I would need to send a copy
immediately to my superior at the headquarters. Try finding a fax at a
restaurant or anywhere nearby while having dinner. 
The solution was simple, to carry
those basic office equipment with me. I christened it Mobile Office. Think about it. What do we do mostly at the office?
Print, Scan, Fax, Email, Calls and Meetings, right? So, Mobile Office (Mobile+)
handles the printing, the scanning, the faxing and the emailing. It can even
handle some of the calling, using a headset; it’s fitted with GSM, CDMA, LTE,
WiFi. With a Skype account, a Wifi connection and a headset (if you want
privacy; otherwise, the speaker is perfect to use), you can start making calls
the day you receive Mobile+. As far as the meetings aspect of the office, I
need to have another dialog with God.
Below, the first images are what Mobile+ looked like when first
conceived, bulky, heavy. Time has changed; and of course today, the second
images are rather contemporary.

THE PRODUCT
Below is an image of the current
schematic; this is where we're at. For obvious reasons, a number of proprietary placements of circuitry
and labeling are not revealed. Later in this document, there is a timeline of
activities regarding the concept, the patent application, the schematics and
the expected date of completion of Mobile+.
Mobile+ Internal Circuitry



WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?
We are very anxious to get Mobile+ completed and introduced to the
market; we have already taken a number of steps to make that happen:


May 2012: InterNotes
     Mobile applied for and was granted a provisional patent (EFS ID: 12900728;
     Application No: 61653525; Confirmation No: 9840)


May 2012:
     InterNotes Mobile applied for a tax ID with US Internal Revenue Service; tax ID was issued (EIN: 45-5388174)


June 2013: Filing
     with New York (NY) Department of State for Certificate of Corporation; one (1) billion
     shares registered along with the filing. NY State approved InterNotes
     Mobile request for Corporation status in the state of NY (DOS ID: 4377538)


Ongoing:
     Schematic Update, Improvement, Change, Substitution. This is where most of the time is being spent to bring scanning, printing & faxing to  Mobile+ without extra weight or loss in performance.


Ongoing:
     Negotiation with Manufacturer; we take a one-stop shopping approach to
     minimize delay, problems and cost. The manufacturer tasked to complete the
     prototype is also responsible for manufacturing; in addition, the
     manufacturer is tasked to handle
     procurement of raw materials and any components necessary to build Mobile+


TBD:
      Upon final schematic, a new provisional patent will be filed to
     reflect the final drawings as well as the look of Mobile+


TBD: Upon
     final schematic, certification with FCC


Jan-Feb 2015: Finalize
     Schematic


March 2015: Working prototype; corrections, improvements, changes,etc..


April 2015:
     Fully working Prototype

May-June 2015: Working model

July-Sept 2015: FULL testing of all components and functionalities

October 2015: Preparation for production and other miscellaneous


Oct-Nov 2015:
     Production begins


Nov-Dec 2015: Shipment
     begins



Great Plan, would it work?
I am a very optimistic individual; I
am most inclined to believe that if one plans properly, most everything should
work. I am not however naïve to ignore problems that could creep in sometimes.
We are prepared to deal with those unfortunate situations. The one promise we
have vowed to keep is NOT to release a “half-baked” product. It is frustrating
sometimes that a promised date is not met; it is however most frustrating if
the promised product does not live up to its hype. 
To minimize delays, we have
carefully selected the manufacturer that will handle all aspects of production.
I will personally monitor the manufacturer’s activity to be abreast of any
problem and address it promptly. You will be kept abreast as well; we are working
the logistics to update all interested parties either on a weekly or bi-weekly
basis.
Having said all that, we are fully
committed to abide by the aforementioned dates

<h1><strong>How does SocialFrames Work?</strong></h1>
<p>SocialFrames connects to your Social Networks including: Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and LinkedIn and collects all the Likes, Tweets, Posts, and Shares from Friends, Followers, Circles &amp; Connections. Then it processes this raw social network data and creates a single animated tag cloud graphic that represents your social sphere. This tag cloud is re-rendered regularly, and animated... the tag cloud changes with changes to your social network.</p>
<p><strong>What is a Tag Cloud? </strong>They are a visual representation of the frequency of word usage. Frequently used words are displayed the biggest, while infrequently used words appear smallest. At a glace you can immediately see the <strong>most popular</strong> words / topics being discussed - as well all the other conversations as well.</p>
<h1><strong>What can I do with SocialFrames?</strong></h1>
<p>The SocialFrames tag cloud animation normally moves forward in time... As updates are posted to your Social Networks the keywords appear as a tag in the SocialFrames tag cloud. Initially the tag appears small and dimly lit, and it gets bigger and brighter as the original post is re-tweeted, liked, or shared.</p>
<ul>
<li>When you see a tag on your SocialFrames that interests you, simply <strong>touch</strong> it, to see a List View of all the social updates that include that tag.</li>

<li>From there you can click on a single update - to view in more detail and Reply to as a Tweet, a Like, Share or Post directly from SocialFrames.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>The Pause, Fast Forward, and Rewind buttons control the animation - you can move backwards or forwards through the last 24-hours.</li>
</ul><ul>
<li>The Timeline on the far right is synchronized - and the current local time is always displayed at the top. When you click Rewind button - the timeline will scroll upwards and show you the animated tag cloud for the last 24-hours of your social network updates.</li>

</h3>
<p>We expect the standard challenges in building Mobile Applications - the first 80% goes quickly - then the last 20% takes FOREVER! We've built this into our plan - and we'll target an initial release which scope constrained to lessen any delays. We'll release this v1.0 to backers via the Apple iTunes store and the Google Play Store. After this is done we'll begin taking feedback, and working on the next release.</p>
<p>We're using an experienced ODM (Original Device Manufacturer) for our Android Tablets - and they have experience in delivering these devices at volume and in a timely fashion - so we don't expect any hardware related challenges.</p>
<p>We may experience risk with interfacing / extracting / updating Social Network Updates to &amp; from the various Social Network we're planning to integrate with. Some Social Networks have Read / Write APIs, other only offer Read, still others are ambivalent to even reading with Mobile Apps. We have Primary Strategy for these integrations, and we've investigated several ""Back-Up"" strategies incase we run into issues.</p>

RISKS AND CHALLENGES 

We expect the standard challenges in building Mobile Applications - the first 80% goes quickly - then the last 20% takes FOREVER! We've built this into our plan - and we'll target an initial release which scope constrained to lessen any delays. We'll release this v1.0 to backers via the Apple iTunes store and the Google Play Store. After this is done we'll begin taking feedback, and working on the next release.
We're using an experienced ODM (Original Device Manufacturer) for our Android Tablets - and they have experience in delivering these devices at volume and in a timely fashion - so we don't expect any hardware related challenges.
We may experience risk with interfacing / extracting / updating Social Network Updates to & from the various Social Network we're planning to integrate with. Some Social Networks have Read / Write APIs, other only offer Read, still others are ambivalent to even reading with Mobile Apps. We have Primary Strategy for these integrations, and we've investigated several ""Back-Up"" strategies incase we run into issues.",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><span>Great observation! Yes you are right, that's an SD card reader. With an SD card, you can use it as a data storage for your Arduino application. You can also read and write to the SD card using functions from our Andee library for Arduino. Most importantly, you can use it to update Annikken Andee's firmware to the latest versions.</span></p>
<h3><span>What are the Arduino variants that I can use?<br/></span></h3>
<p><span>Currently, Annikken Andee, as a shield, is designed to fit and work properly with Arduino Uno, Arduino Mega and Arduino Leonardo. It can work with Arduino Nano as well, but you need to connect the Arduino Nano's ICSP header with Annikken Andee and wire both their pin 8 together. Support for other Arduino boards/variants are currently being tested.</span></p>
<h3><span>Can Annikken Andee work with additional Arduino shields?</span></h3>
<p>Yes. Annikken Andee connects to Arduino using the ICSP header (On Arduino) and pin 8. The rest of the pins are available for you to use with shields or other components. The corresponding SPI pins of each Arduino platform should not be used as well. You can refer to individual <a href=""http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/SPI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Arduino</a> page for the SPI pins.</p>
<h3><span>What about my Android Smartphone and Tablets?</span></h3>
<p>Yes. Annikken Andee can work with any Android Smartphone or Tablets as long as it has a working bluetooth with Android 4.0 Ice-Cream Sandwich and above.</p>

How does my Arduino talk to my Android Smartphones and Tablets? 
Using Bluetooth 2.1. Simply pair and connect Annikken Andee with your Android devices just like you would with any other bluetooth devices. However, Annikken Andee is a Special Bluetooth Arduino shield with additional hardware/ICs and firmware inside to create this wonderful magic! 
Annikken Andee uses the FCC CE certified WT11i bluetooth module from Bluegiga. This module is capable of reaching distances of up to 350 meters line-of-sight module to module. For actual distance, it depends on the bluetooth chip of your Android device and also how/where Annikken Andee is being positioned.

<h3>Personalize Your Juice4Halt</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>You like the Juice4Halt, but you would
prefer using another pin for communication at the GPIO interface? Or
do you want to have your own connectors assembled? No matter!</p>
<p>Just download the <a href=""http://juice4halt.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/juice4halt_schematic_public_20140927.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">circuit diagram</a>,
choose the perk ""Personalize Your Juice4Halt“ and tell us what
components you want to have changed. We will modify your Juice4Halt
and you don't have to solder the parts yourself.</p>
<p>There is just one condition: We have to
review your change and we must agree with it. This is just to protect
your project from failure.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>And the components? We will cover the cost
of materials up to a value of 50 cents. That means if you want to have a few resistors changed, we will not charge you for it. However, if you want to
have a connector changed, we have to agree on the price beforehand.</p>

<h3>Why Indiegogo?</h3>
<p>
</p>
<br/><ul><li>The Juice4Halt module is a new product
originally suited for industrial and embedded applications. As we
have noticed a lot of positive feedback from makers and hobbyists from all over the
world, we decided to start this campaign to have direct contact with
them. </li></ul>
<ul><li>We don't want to
start mass production without knowing the demand on Juice4Halt. 
 Indiegogo can help us to better understand and estimate the demand. The Juice4Halt module will retail for more than offered here in this campaign, so use this chance to get it for a special price. <br/>
</li></ul>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Financial risk</b></p>
<p>There is no financial risk in this
campaign. We have completely funded the development and production of
the prototypes.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Technical risk  
</b></p>
<p>As you can see in the video, the version 1.0
prototypes are working properly. There is a little technical risk related to the latest redesign of the board. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Demand risk</b></p>
<p>Since we couldn't find any related
product on the market we could compare it to, we are not sure about the demand.  From our
point of view, this is our most significant risk. <br/></p>
<br/><br/><h3>Timescale</h3>
<p>The estimated date of shipping the
Juice4Halt modules to you: </p>
<p>End of January 2015</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Shipping, Customs and Taxes</h3>
<p>
</p>All
perks in this campaign include 20% VAT, unless otherwise expressly stated.<br/>Shipment
via registered mail by Slovak postal service:<br/><br/><ul>
<li>EU:
3 to 5 days</li>
<li>USA:
5 to 7 days</li>
<li>Australia:
6 to 7 days</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>For
shipments outside of the EU:</b> <br/></p>
<p>Please check with your country's
custom's office to determine import duties and taxes. These are not
included in the prices and are your responsibility. According to
<a href=""http://www.dutycalculator.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.dutycalculator.com</a>
there are no taxes or custom's fees when shipped to the USA up to a value
of $200. However, we can't guarantee this information.</p>
<p>The Juice4Halt module will be manufactured in the EU.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Safety and EMC Compliance</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p>The module is supplied as a sub-assembly
and is not subject to any EMC regulations. Since the user's end product
must comply to EMC regulations (CE, FCC, RCM,Industry Canada....), we guarantee that the Juice4Halt module meets the EMC Directive 2004/108/EC
which is mandatory for European CE marking. A test report by an accredited EMC testing lab will be attached here as soon as it becomes available.<br/></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Juice4Halt module was designed for
integration into a system with the Raspberry Pi.  Before using it, it
must be installed into a suitable enclosure. Before plugging it in,
unplugging it,  or working on the module, the supercapacitors must be
discharged. 
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>The Low Voltage Directive 2006/95/EC
is not applicable because the Juice4Halt module uses voltages far
below 75V DC.</p>

 When we started thinking about using the Raspberry Pi in applications requiring a bit more reliable operation, we always had to face the same problems: 

Power outages
Corrupted file systems or SD-cards

Brownouts
Inrush currents


As a solution to these problems, we have created the Juice4Halt module. It combines brownout protection and a short-term UPS for properly shutting down the Raspberry Pi. Instead of a conventional battery, the module uses two supercapacitors. 
The advantages of using supercapacitors

wide temperature range

no maintenance
long lifetime
no mechanical contacts
uncomplicated transportation
no environmental issues

The Performance

The Juice4Halt module is a supercapacitor based energy storage. Combined with a Raspberry Pi (Model B, OS Raspbian) it offers:


1 minute backup time for a safe shutdown 


12 seconds protection against short-term power failure or brown-out 
high reliability of operation with peripheral devices attached to the 5V supply output. No risk of voltage drops on the power rail (e.g. at hard drive start up)

Personalize Your Juice4Halt


You like the Juice4Halt, but you would
prefer using another pin for communication at the GPIO interface? Or
do you want to have your own connectors assembled? No matter!
Just download the circuit diagram,
choose the perk ""Personalize Your Juice4Halt“ and tell us what
components you want to have changed. We will modify your Juice4Halt
and you don't have to solder the parts yourself.
There is just one condition: We have to
review your change and we must agree with it. This is just to protect
your project from failure.


And the components? We will cover the cost
of materials up to a value of 50 cents. That means if you want to have a few resistors changed, we will not charge you for it. However, if you want to
have a connector changed, we have to agree on the price beforehand.

  Juice4Halt - PLUG&PLAY (Model B+)
In the video, we have used the version 1.0 prototype for the 
demonstration. In the pictures, we have used the final version 2.0 
prototype. It works exactly the same way as version 1.0 does.

Why Indiegogo?


The Juice4Halt module is a new product
originally suited for industrial and embedded applications. As we
have noticed a lot of positive feedback from makers and hobbyists from all over the
world, we decided to start this campaign to have direct contact with
them. 
We don't want to
start mass production without knowing the demand on Juice4Halt. 
 Indiegogo can help us to better understand and estimate the demand. The Juice4Halt module will retail for more than offered here in this campaign, so use this chance to get it for a special price. 


Risks and Challenges


Financial risk
There is no financial risk in this
campaign. We have completely funded the development and production of
the prototypes.


Technical risk  

As you can see in the video, the version 1.0
prototypes are working properly. There is a little technical risk related to the latest redesign of the board. 



Demand risk
Since we couldn't find any related
product on the market we could compare it to, we are not sure about the demand.  From our
point of view, this is our most significant risk. 
Timescale
The estimated date of shipping the
Juice4Halt modules to you: 
End of January 2015





Shipping, Customs and Taxes

All
perks in this campaign include 20% VAT, unless otherwise expressly stated.Shipment
via registered mail by Slovak postal service:
EU:
3 to 5 days
USA:
5 to 7 days
Australia:
6 to 7 days



For
shipments outside of the EU: 
Please check with your country's
custom's office to determine import duties and taxes. These are not
included in the prices and are your responsibility. According to
www.dutycalculator.com
there are no taxes or custom's fees when shipped to the USA up to a value
of $200. However, we can't guarantee this information.
The Juice4Halt module will be manufactured in the EU.







Safety and EMC Compliance


The module is supplied as a sub-assembly
and is not subject to any EMC regulations. Since the user's end product
must comply to EMC regulations (CE, FCC, RCM,Industry Canada....), we guarantee that the Juice4Halt module meets the EMC Directive 2004/108/EC
which is mandatory for European CE marking. A test report by an accredited EMC testing lab will be attached here as soon as it becomes available.


The Juice4Halt module was designed for
integration into a system with the Raspberry Pi.  Before using it, it
must be installed into a suitable enclosure. Before plugging it in,
unplugging it,  or working on the module, the supercapacitors must be
discharged. 



The Low Voltage Directive 2006/95/EC
is not applicable because the Juice4Halt module uses voltages far
below 75V DC.

<p></p></div>","Privacy.  It’s a human
right.  At Jumble we believe privacy matters so we’re simplifying email
encryption.  
Your personal
information is gathered, collated and distributed in an alarming number of ways
through a growing number of technologies. 
Jumble is DISRUPTING the
collection of data and attachments contained in your emails through its new
email encryption service.  You use your
existing email account as normal but layer Jumble in on top to CREATE A BARRIER between your data and
the surveillance, the hackers and the corporate spies.
Have you ever sent an
email that contained sensitive information, like your bank details?  Were you
ever worried that someone else could see them?  Or are you tired of other
awkward and clunky ways to protect your information?  Jumble is an easy to use email encryption
product for EVERYONE.  We
developed Jumble because we passionately believe that privacy matters.
We
are a self-funded start up that feels strongly that YOU should have the choice to protect your
data using a seamless end-to-end encryption product from within your existing
email account.
Our
product is FREE and we need YOUR donations to keep going and
support other platforms and more users.


Why is it needed?

Emails and their
attachments can be intercepted, read and collected.  This is an abuse of our human rights.  We don’t know what is being done with this
collected information but the possibilities are frightening….and that’s before
you consider what could be done if the information were to fall in to the wrong
hands.


Orwellian predictions of the public having absolutely no privacy and being subject to round the clock government surveillance as a means to control citizens have come to pass.  It’s time to take back your data and take back your privacy.
Google, Yahoo and Microsoft are all fond
of targeted ads.  These ads can only be targeted because the webmail
provider is reading your emails.
Email accounts are regularly hacked and device theft
is on the rise both of which compromise the security of your data.  Jumble adds
another level of protection to your data giving you peace of mind even if your
email password is by-passed.
The answer is email encryption however up until now it
has been a difficult and clumsy solution to use, which most everyday email
users don’t persevere with and as a result  most people’s emails remain unprotected and
open to interception and attack.
We think your privacy is as important as the big
companies and we want to give everyone the chance to protect themselves.
Why do we need YOUR Support?

Our
product has been in public beta since the summer for Gmail via Google Chrome
and an iPhone app but we don’t want to stop there.  We want to bring our
product to even more people – we want EVERYONE
to be able to protect themselves.

<p>We have spent months testing, more importantly, using prototypes and refining and acquiring information from firearms owners, child access prevention networks, top mobile design engineers and software developers to make the user experience simple and reliable.
<br/></p><p>GunBoxLive™ has been designed and prototyped in Seattle, WA and we plan to manufacture via a trusted partner with operations based in Seattle and Shenzhen. We realize that whilst we're reinventing the gun case this doesn't mean we have to<br/>reinvent the manufacturing process. </p><p>We are using as many standard gun cases and wireless transmittal components as possible. These components have undergone rigorous testing and stood the test of time. We are also very excited to create our own GunBoxLive™ customized computer board as ""the brains"" of this project. Also, fully featured apps will be available on the App Store® and Android.</p>

<p><b>What will happen when GunBoxLive is accessed?</b><br/>
GunBoxLive will alert you or the person you have included in alert instructions that the firearm was accessed.</p>
<p><strong><b>What happens when the firearm is put back into GunBoxLive?</b></strong><br/>
GunBoxLive will send an alert that the firearm was replaced.</p>
<p><strong><b>What happens if there is no activity for a long period of time, will the box communicate with me?</b></strong><br/>
Yes, GunBoxLive will periodically send you “I am still alive” and you can review functional reports online for your peace of mind that your firearm is secure.</p>
<p><strong><strong><b>How long will the battery last?</b></strong><br/></strong>Expected battery life is about 1 year depending on use. The MD3G device will let you know when it needs to be recharged. Charging is simple through the GunBoxLive™ USB interface.</p>
<p><strong><b>What if my firearm is stolen?</b></strong><br/>
If your firearm is stolen go to <a href=""http://www.gunboxlive.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.gunboxlive.com</a> or access your app on your smartphone to log in and click on the stolen gun tab. Input stolen gun serial number and click send. Your stolen firearm will instantly upload on the stolen weapon registry database.</p>
<p><strong><strong><b>Are there monthly charges for GunBoxLive™ ?</b></strong>
</strong><br/>Your first year subscription is included in the purchase price. You will be able to renew your subscription for 1 year at $60, 2 years at $50/yr or 3 years at $40/yr.</p>
<p><strong><strong><b>Why is <strong><strong><b>GunBoxLive™</b></strong></strong> Cellular based?</b></strong>
</strong><br/>We've been told by firearms owners 1) they need the mobile security and 2) that when the Wi-Fi is down, that is when you need security and information the most. We believe cellular is the most reliable way to give consistent service where it is needed most.</p>
<p><strong><b>Do I have to provide my gun's serial number?</b></strong><br/>
No, the information you give us is up to you and under your control. Providing the serial number does give you an easy method to add your gun to the stolen gun database if it is stolen, but it is not required.</p>
<p><strong><strong><b>How do I receive notifications and alerts?</b></strong>
</strong><br/>You will receive alerts to the smart phone, computer, or email of your choice. With GunBoxLive™ you can also add additional people to your list to receive notifications.</p>
<p>If you have any further questions, please don't hesitate to contact us.</p></div>","GunBoxLive™ Saves LivesGunBoxLive™ is a wireless, energy efficient portable personal security device that alerts you 
if a case is 
tampered with, opened, or stolen. Alerts are delivered to your computer, tablet, 
cell phone or iPhone/Android smartphone through simple, user-friendly apps. 
GunBoxLive™ is easy to set up, gives you unprecedented awareness of status of your case and the 
valuables in it. GunBoxLive™ reduces the 
risk of unauthorized access or theft. 
We envisioned GunBoxLive™ with the secure storage of firearms in mind. We provide locking cases without the worry of lockout due to technical failure. You can also install the GunBoxLive™ device into most existing gun cases! The bottom line, we help you “Protect the Ones You Love” and “Protect the Things You Love” and provide peace of mind at home or on the go. We believe that the GunBoxLive™ Smart Case will improve security and save lives.GunBoxLive™ will save lives by preventing or interrupting actions that lead to tragic consequences. GunBoxLive™ alert notifications transmit critical information to gun owners whenever someone gains access to their firearm. In addition, the information provided by GunBoxLive™ apps can be used to increase public awareness and initiate lockdowns in specific areas or neighborhoods where stolen weapons are reported. 

Firearm prevalence,
inadequate and unsafe storage are factors associated with the high rates of
unintentional firearm deaths and thefts. There are over 60 million firearms privately owned in the US. Only a tiny fraction of those are stored in a way that provides their owners with the security of knowing the instant their firearm has been tampered with or stolen.
•Every 25 minutes
someone is unintentionally shot
•$375,000,000 worth
of firearms are stolen a year
•More than 1,000,000
car break-ins per year
•80% of stolen
firearms are stolen away from home
•50% of youth
suicides are committed with guns
•Children and teens
steal relatives' cars to joy ride everyday
•Millions of dollars
in valuables are stolen every day


Of youths who have committed suicide with firearms, 82% obtained the firearm from their home, usually a parent’s firearm (The National Violent Injury Statistics System, p. 2).
When storage status was noted, about two-thirds of the firearms had been stored unlocked (The National Violent Injury Statistics System, p. 2).
Among the remaining cases in which the firearms had been locked, the youth knew the combination or where the key was kept or broke into the cabinet (The National Violent Injury Statistics System, p. 2).


GunBoxLive™ is an evolution in security that all responsible firearm owners should have. GunBoxLive™ gives you the peace of mind that your firearms are secure and accounted for every second of every day! With 20,000 unintentional shootings and 500,000 firearm thefts a year in America, it makes sense to upgrade to GunBoxLive™. However, this is just part of the story; GunBoxLive™ is about responsibility! 
Instant alerts
provide a deterrent and intervention for children and teens who know their
parents are notified immediately if they even move the case. These cases can also be used for other sensitive items requiring security such as prescription medications, bicycles, boats, jewelry, spare keys, and other valuables.




We decided to use cell transmission technology for a number of reasons, but the main reason is that we feel this is the best way to stay connected with your cases. Cell technology is somewhat more expensive than other radio transmitters; however, it is very reliable and convenient.
We realize that people are very mobile and so are their valuables. We want to offer our customers the best possible coverage that will cater to almost any scenario.




""GunBoxLive gives you peace of mind and is a great product! I have seen the demo work and it is incredible how easy it is to set up. I am a firearms owner and feel that all responsible firearms owners should have GunBoxLive!""
 -Dan Ramirez, Military Veteran, Business Owner





""For me GunBoxLive is the ideal solution to the problem of gun theft and safely securing firearms properly from unintended use of children. If I would of had GunBoxLive 5 years ago I would of avoided the loss of 2 very expensive hand guns."" 
-Stuart Williams, Hunter, Columnist





""Being a staunch supporter of the 2nd Amendment, GunBoxLive is the best way to protect my rights, my family and unintended misuse of a firearm.  We do have the right to bear arms, but we also have an equal if not greater responsibility to protect that right and those around us."" 
-Fred Thornes, Active Outdoorsman, Entrepreneur



Patent Pending
Device installation in seconds for almost any brand hard gun case
Wireless connectivity
Long life rechargeable battery
Discreet design & minimum space needed for your existing case
Keeps you aware of your firearms and valuables 24 hours a day
Just upload your info on the app or website on where you want the alerts to go (cell phone and/or email) and you’re ready! Turn on device and enjoy!We do not need the serial number of your firearm or item you are securing in GunBoxLive™ to activate your service.
We have spent months testing, more importantly, using prototypes and refining and acquiring information from firearms owners, child access prevention networks, top mobile design engineers and software developers to make the user experience simple and reliable.
GunBoxLive™ has been designed and prototyped in Seattle, WA and we plan to manufacture via a trusted partner with operations based in Seattle and Shenzhen. We realize that whilst we're reinventing the gun case this doesn't mean we have toreinvent the manufacturing process. We are using as many standard gun cases and wireless transmittal components as possible. These components have undergone rigorous testing and stood the test of time. We are also very excited to create our own GunBoxLive™ customized computer board as ""the brains"" of this project. Also, fully featured apps will be available on the App Store® and Android.

We have designed, redesigned and reimagined GunBoxLive™ numerous times during the past 15 months—pouring countless hours into understanding and improving the user experience, and incorporating feedback from gun owners, moms and dads, retailers, doctors, students, hunters, truckers, and techies. We are in our final, urgent push to bring GunBoxLive™ to the world.

This campaign is seeking $100,000—crucial funding that will allow us to:

Complete regulatory certifications
Finalize product design
Gain critical momentum that will allow us to deliver GunBoxLive™ at a reasonable price.
Begin production—GunBoxLive™ cases for guns and SecureBoxLive™ for jewelry, tablets, cameras, wine, and watches – anything that fits!

<p>NOT ONLY DO WE NOT NEED THIS MONEY, WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO NOT DONATE UNLESS YOU ARE SURE! We do not need this money. there is enough money in the kitty to keep us running for months. we have recieved bad press recently for making money from this, what people dont understand is that we have touched none of it. we pay the admins, and run the cost of the server, and the rest goes to a kitty we will use when donations stop! Whether you believe that or not is your choice, but thats what happens :) </p>
<p>Currently there is enough money in the kitty to last us, if the donations STOP NOW, another: 5 months.<br/><br/>AFTER DONATING, PLEASE LEAVE YOUR INGAME NAME AND PREFERRED GUN IF APPLICABLE IN THE COMMENTS TAB!!! WE CAN NOT PUT GUNS OR ANY OTHER ITEMS IN BACKPACKS!<br/><br/></p>
<p>We have been required to introduce a cost to perk changes for two reasons. one, because it takes a fair amount of time to remake a perk, and two, it is easier for us to keep track of who has what, and the extra need to keep records of how many changes have been made etc.</p>
<p><br/>you can NOT spawn with any of the following:<br/><br/>1. items in BAGS<br/><br/>2. repair equipment (tyres, fuel etc)<br/><br/>3. rpgs, satchel charges, grenades or smoke grenades<br/><br/>4. radio<br/><br/>5. bags any larger than Alice size</p>
<p>6. any form of machine gun</p>
<p><br/>IF YOU DONATE, the procedure for spawning with weapons is as such:<br/><br/>step 1; create a new character<br/><br/>step 2; once logged in, log out within 25 minutes of creating the character, and wait at the lobby for 1 minute<br/><br/>step 3; log back in, once logged in, you will have your weapons and will spawn at your vehicle location (if you have that perk)<br/><br/>step 4; if this does not work, repeat. if it still does not work, contact krauterz or mancow ingame or by email at krauterz@live.com.<br/><br/>step 5; DONATORS CAN NOT CHANGE THEIR PERKS ONCE THE ORIGINAL REQUEST HAS BEEN PROCESSED!<br/><br/>**DONATION PERK RULES**<br/><br/>*1 DO NOT TELL ANYONE THE LOCATION OF VEHICLES!<br/><br/>*2 no deliberate trolling, or exploiting. this includes using vehicles that you have not got the perk access to use<br/><br/>*3 NO SPAWN CAMPING. it is ok to sit in capitals and murder innocents, but give them a change to get out of the city first..<br/><br/>*4 NO WASTING VEHICLES. dont crash one helicopter into 8 others..<br/><br/><br/>*5 TRY NOT TO ADD TOO MANY VEHICLES TO THE GAME! take a chopper to a capital, but HIDE IT WELL. OR imobilize it.<br/><br/>*6 AND FINALLY, DONT DEATHMATCH OR SHOOT OTHERS AT PERK LOCATIONS!!! it takes up to 10 minutes to respawn there each time. please dont do it!

BREAKING RULES MAY RESULT IN SUSPENSION OF PERKS, REMOVAL OF PERKS AND DEPENDING ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE INCIDENT, BANS MAY BE APPLIED**<br/><br/>Short Summary<br/><br/>ZUST is the most popular Day-Z sanctuary (private hive) server currently running. Funding is running well, the server is stable and we do not need any donations. however, due to popular demand, we will be keeping this donation page up :)</p>
<p>(the reason the perks are not cheaper, is so that not too many people are running around with 50 cals ;)<br/>we just upgraded our server! its now an 8 core with HT (meaning 16 virtual cores!) 8gb of ram and almost 1gbps connection!<br/><br/><br/>What We Need &amp; What You Get<br/>Realisticly, all we need is one months worth of funding, which is $460. ($169 for the server and $300 to hire 3 full time RDC admins) however, the more we collect, the better this server will become. more money means more slots, better uptime and less lag. granted, at the moment we are not looking to expand, but any excess money made gets added to a kitty, which will be used in the event that donations stop :)<br/><br/><br/>QUIRKS INCLUDE WEAPONS AND VEHICLES! depending on how much you donate, we can set you up with weapons, and other items. if you donate a lot, we can even make you spawn at a bunch of Hueys, littlebirds and MI-17's. If we do not reach our goal of $460, no big problem, money will be taken from the kitty to pay for the server until funding is at its target once again.<br/><br/>The Impact<br/>You will be securing ZUST's future in the world of Day-Z. This includes standalone, and many many months, if not years to come.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Other Ways You Can Help<br/>If you cant donate, dont worry, just like us on facebook! and of course feel free to connect to our server to talk directly to an admin!</p>

AND ONLY IF PLAYER GIVES A RELIABLE REASON FOR THEIR REFUND REQUEST! THIS IS A DONATION SYSTEM! NOT A PAY TO RECEIVE SYSTEM!**DONATING ACCEPTS THESE RULES. BREAKING RULES MAY RESULT IN SUSPENSION OF PERKS, REMOVAL OF PERKS AND DEPENDING ON THE MAGNITUDE OF THE INCIDENT, BANS MAY BE APPLIED**Short SummaryZUST is the most popular Day-Z sanctuary (private hive) server currently running. Funding is running well, the server is stable and we do not need any donations. however, due to popular demand, we will be keeping this donation page up :)
(the reason the perks are not cheaper, is so that not too many people are running around with 50 cals ;)we just upgraded our server! its now an 8 core with HT (meaning 16 virtual cores!) 8gb of ram and almost 1gbps connection!What We Need & What You GetRealisticly, all we need is one months worth of funding, which is $460. ($169 for the server and $300 to hire 3 full time RDC admins) however, the more we collect, the better this server will become. more money means more slots, better uptime and less lag. granted, at the moment we are not looking to expand, but any excess money made gets added to a kitty, which will be used in the event that donations stop :)QUIRKS INCLUDE WEAPONS AND VEHICLES! depending on how much you donate, we can set you up with weapons, and other items. if you donate a lot, we can even make you spawn at a bunch of Hueys, littlebirds and MI-17's. If we do not reach our goal of $460, no big problem, money will be taken from the kitty to pay for the server until funding is at its target once again.The ImpactYou will be securing ZUST's future in the world of Day-Z. This includes standalone, and many many months, if not years to come.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you cant donate, dont worry, just like us on facebook! and of course feel free to connect to our server to talk directly to an admin!
connect to our TeamSpeak and just talk to us! we like to make new friends :)",0.0,0,"12 Campaigns

The experience has prepared us for some of the unforeseen challenges we might encounter during the tooling, manufacturing, testing, and certification processes.While we have been relentlessly concerned with the details throughout designing, prototyping, and planning for production, there is always a chance that things might not go as planned.In the event of any unscheduled circumstance, whether it's a delay in the manufacturing timeline, shipping date, or something else, we promise to communicate honestly with you and work around the clock until the issue is corrected.",27.0,3,"1 Campaign

As engineers, adventurers, travelers, and technicians, we believe there should be a more practical and smarter handheld device to help us in our work and live.
So, we designed Ulefone Armor 9 - the world's first industrial-grade rugged smartphone.

Just for professionals?
Definitely not! Our mission is to provide convenience for all people's life and work. In addition to powerful industrial applications, the Ulefone Armor 9 is a versatile rugged smartphone that applies to everyone.

<p>But, now we need your continued help to get our newest creation, the Lumenator, off the ground. We have made 3 working prototypes of a revolutionary type of LED lighting for both Photo and Video. The Lumenator dual purpose light is softer (LEDNatural technology), thinner (.5"") , lighter (13 ounces) and more flexible (dual purpose) than any conventional LED photo or video light. You can use the Lumenator as a revolutionary continuous cool light source, a photo flash diffuser, as a handheld light source, or as a small and powerful portable studio light.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://d2oadd98wnjs7n.cloudfront.net/file_attachments/9734/files/20130813102659-light.jpg?1376414819"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Most pro LED photo and video lights are harsh and specular, unless diffused to within an inch of their life. Lumenator uses Patent Pending LEDNatural technology to produce the smoothest, most natural LED lighting you have ever seen. The Lumenator side-mounted LED lights are diffused multiple times before they light your subject. You won't get the typical squints, fake grins and hot spots that you get with conventional rear-mounted LED panels. In the case of the Lumenator, soft luscious light does not equal low power. Lumenator uses only high-grade Samsung daylight balanced LED chips rated at over 50 lumens per LED. In fact, Lumenator delivers almost as much power as a 300 watt incandescent bulb. These LED chips also have a high CRI (&gt;=80) providing natural and vivid color rendition.</p>

</div></div>","Are you full of crazy and exciting ideas but don’t know how to bring them to life? Maybe you think about 3D printing them, but then you realize that 3D printers cost too much money? Maybe you already have one but it's not working properly (or like they said it would), or you are new to 3D printing and want an easy to use 3D printer?
That's exactly why we created !






We have been active followers of 3D printing in the past few years. After monitoring news, reading comparisons, testing different models, we really couldn't decide which 3D printer could be the most appropriate one to buy for everyday use as well as professionally. So, we developed the  which is the best you can get for your money!














ALUMINIUM FRAME
The aluminium structure ensures that the printer is lightweight but still rock solid, strong and stable.



AUTO LEVELING
Neptune includes a deployable end-stop for platform leveling. Before printing, it automatically measures height at 9 points providing consistent first layer height even on an uneven print platform.


EXTRUDER
The printer is equipped with a “gripPYItruder”, a Bowden style extruder made for 1.75mm filament, ensuring consistent grip with adjustable tension. Ideal even for use with flexible filaments.

HOTEND
A hotend that can reach temperatures of up to 300°C allows you to print a wide range of materials. With the dual head upgrade Neptune can print either two colors or two materials in a single print.

CHANGEABLE NOZZLES
Changeable nozzles from 0.2 mm up to 0.8 mm wide (all included with every Neptune) allow for both high-quality detailed prints and for stronger, less detailed prints at a quicker speed.


LINEAR RAIL MOTION
The linear rail motion system, like those used in high end CNC machines,achieves precise and smooth printing. We use them on all three axes – X,Y,Z.

HEATED BED
Prevent warping with a heated bed that can reach temperatures of up to 120°C. Print onto borosilicate glass ensuring excellent adhesion and easy removal, or select your own alternative adhesion methods.

CURA SOFTWARE
This easy to use, Open Source program was specially modified for Neptune. It comes pre-loaded with the material and speed settings you need to get started.


LCD DISPLAY
The LCD display and simple dial give you full control of the printer without need for a computer. Store and print projects directly from an SD card.

LED LIGHTS
The LED lights allow you to see your whole project clearly, giving you the attention to detail you desire.




With a resolution up to 50 microns (0,05 millimeters) and a speed up to 150 mm/s your prints can be both highly detailed and very fast. You can also speed up your printing process, or make your prints more detailed by changing different nozzles, which come with your printer. Along with stock 0.4 mm, you will get 3 additional nozzles 0.2 mm, 0.6 mm, 0.8 mm, where 0.2 mm supports higher precision at lower speed and vice versa 0.8 mm for lower precision at high speed printing.



You can build projects up to 300x300x300 mm/11.8x11.8x11.8  inches (W×H×D), while the whole printer measures 500x500x500 mm/19.7x19.7x19.7 inches. It is protected by a strong and durable aluminium frame.







Are you young and curious about how 3D printing works and you want to explore more with your mom or dad? Are you a tech expert? Are you a grandparent and want to show off in front of youngsters on how you manage technology and simultaneously build yourself something for your home decoration? Are you a designer or maybe an architect? Are you just an enthusiast who wants to play?


No matter who you are, you can use  in many different ways. Don't worry about the complexity and figuring out how to calibrate your printer. We have been working on making it accessible and user friendly. Just scratch your object or simply download an existing design from over 100 online libraries with millions of designs and ideas. 


It is also the perfect opportunity for business owners and entrepreneurs to create numerous examples/prototypes of your next product/accessory for just a few dollars. It can really be a good investment for your business. For entrepreneurial use, we highly recommend dual head upgrade.

The fully automated system will allow you to just print whatever you want, without worrying about petty and silly processes, like bed leveling and first layer adhesion. Maybe you've wondered why we hadn't put a lot of fancy stuff like touch screens or wireless connectivity. It's because we are focused on extreme reliability, user friendliness and ease of use in our 3D printer, while also looking quite good and at a bargain price.
