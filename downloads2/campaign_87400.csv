<p>If you're reading this, chances are you already know who I am. If not, let me introduce myself. I'm Jonathon Twiz. I'm a hiphop artist from Toronto Canada.</p>
<p>Music is something that has always been meaningful to me. Although I predominantly rhyme in my music. It serves no purpose to categorize me. My music is a melting pot of various styles, which is nothing more than a reflection of my musical tastes and influences. From being in an indie rock band to being apart of a hip-hop collective, I have chosen the solo route to be the best way to voice my opinions and perceptions of the world through the higher frequencies of my music. At this point in my life it has become important to make timeless music. Timeless as in, the type of music that isn’t hot today and forgotten tomorrow. It’s the type of music that is not a fad, but transcends the transitory nature of pop culture, impacting the listener on the same powerful level years later as it did when it was first released. I may not be Michael Jackson or The Beatles, but every artist should strive to make music that is as meaningful, powerful, creative, and thorough as theirs. Now, in hip-hop at least, we have sacrificed quality for quantity. Mixtapes flooding the internet with watered down garbage, hot today, forgotten about tomorrow type of music, rappers only putting their best effort when its time to drop an album. It’s just a bunch of noise… nothing but noise…. We need to rise above the noise.</p>

<p>this is also a social expirament, this will show artists that we can make it on our own terms. It will show the big record companies that we don't need them (not to say that one shouldn't side with a record label but its assuring to know that we can still make it on our own). By taking part in this experiment you yourself are taking charge and helping to change how I make music. You are putting faith in me and directly impacting the quality of my music.</p>
<p>The record industry is backwards. Crowdfunding seems to be something that's working. Whether or not this is the next thing for the music industry, it's a way that supporters of an artist or band can know exactly where their money is going.</p>

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>My name is Jon Bannan. I’m a Christian singer/songwriter, musician, artist, graphic designer, and actor. Four years ago, God called me to be a worship leader. Now, that's exactly what I'll be training to do.</p>
<p>Come August 2013, I’ll start the School of Worship, a yearlong internship hosted by the Honor Academy in Tyler, Texas. This program focuses on Worship Perspectives, Song Writing, Music Theory, Worship and Spiritual Leadership. I will be musically and spiritually challenged in many different ways, especially in my perspective of what worship <em>is </em>by diving into God’s Presence and the Word.</p>

<li>Backing the production of my original 12 song album</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>In recent years, there has been a strong call for Worship Leaders to unite and lift up the name of God in the youth of this generation. The heart and vision of the Honor Academy is to raise up these leaders and to equip them to impact the world for Christ. The Honor Academy is the perfect place to get my feet under me and start living God’s calling for my life. As an intern, I will also help support Teen Mania’s ministries such as Acquire the Fire and Global Expeditions for Christ.</p>

<div>Hi! I'm Jane (not my real name) and I'm 20 years old. Recently, after spending 2 hours driving with my family in a minivan to visit my brother in prison, I <span style=""background-color: initial;"">got turned away because my jeans looked too tight.  They fit me comfortably, but the prison told me I should wear looser jeans. Why? Because with female visitors, jeans that fit are too attractive and could tempt a convicted rapist in the visiting room.</span><span style=""background-color: initial;"">  Crazy, right? So, that's why I need to buy new loose-fitting jeans, because evidently, I have developed a motor in the back of my Honda.</span>

</div></div>","Help me afford loose-fitting jeans for $75 so I can visit my brother in prison without tempting rapists. 
 

Here is what's going on...
Hi! I'm Jane (not my real name) and I'm 20 years old. Recently, after spending 2 hours driving with my family in a minivan to visit my brother in prison, I got turned away because my jeans looked too tight.  They fit me comfortably, but the prison told me I should wear looser jeans. Why? Because with female visitors, jeans that fit are too attractive and could tempt a convicted rapist in the visiting room.  Crazy, right? So, that's why I need to buy new loose-fitting jeans, because evidently, I have developed a motor in the back of my Honda.


I'm also working on getting my brother out of prison. To do this, we need a good lawyer. I do have a job, but all of that money is already going toward our legal expenses. We need about $7,000 to afford one, but I don't want to ask for that much. We can make up the difference, but that's really it. That's what the other $4,000 is for; I don't plan on spending $4,075 on a pair of jeans, folks!


Why My Brother is in Prison

I don't want to relive it or dig up the past, but without saying too much, I can just tell you that he tried to be the good guy and save somebody, but it just didn't work out as planned. My brother, who's only 32, feels horrible about what he did, and he has served 10 years already. He's finally eligible to file for an early release, and we believe he deserves to be released and allowed to return home.
   The Jeans I Want A small portion of the money donated (maybe $50-$75) will be used to buy a comfortable pair of jeans with a baggy fit. I'm usually a size 5, but I'll probably go up a couple sizes, so it doesn't hug any curves or make me look too bootylicious, to avoid arousing any unwanted attention from the other inmates. Definitely no designs on the pockets, don't want to draw the eyes where they don't belong! I'm leaning towards Levi's because they're durable and will last a long time on those uncomfortable chairs in the visiting room. After you make a donation, please feel free to suggest any brands that you think might be unattractive to a rapist!

And Also, The Freedom For My Brother I Want
A much larger portion of the money donated will be put towards legal fees to pay a lawyer to help try to get my brother released from prison.

<h3>Our Story, Our Need.</h3>
<p>We are Live as Lions. We're currently raising money to fund our next tour, album and replace some of our broken equipment before we leave. We've released our EP that cost us $3,000 to create and after much prayer felt the need to make our first release free. But, in the midst of a decision like this, we've also had equipment break down, the need for merchandise, and anything and everything that we do for the band being an out-of-pocket expense. Now, we are honored with the privilege to play Cornerstone 2012, tour the lower 48 (May-July) and begin recording at Emerging Warrior Studios for our full-length album. But, funding a new album and even getting from Alaska to the ""lower 48"" is a 2-3 day drive and it is not a cheap venture by anyone's standard.<br/>A new album doesn't just mean ""more music for the sake of recording""; it's money for potential food, gas, and basic essentials while we are on the road. This tour is also not just a ""tour for the sake of touring""; this is playing with other amazing bands and labels that have supported us from day one and the opportunity to turn this into the career we desperately want it to be.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>The funds we need for this are absolutely essential. But, if you are unable to give financially, or if you would like to give something else in-addition you can also donate airline miles to us before we leave for tour (May-July). While we are on the road drinks, food, or a place for us to sleep (other than our van) is always appreciated. If you have anything else you'd like to donate, please email us at liveaslions@gmail.com and we'll respond as soon as we can.</p>
<p>Most importantly, after donating, help us by spreading the word about who we are, what we're doing and what we need. You're influence is invaluable.</p>

We are proud to welcome internationally acclaimed cellist Jamie Walton – www.jamiewalton.com – to the stage for a performance of Elgar’s famous Cello Concerto.
 
The cost of running a symphonic concert requires support and help from music-lovers worldwide. Our goal is to raise $7500 (GBP £5000) which will go a long way to pay musicians fees.
The money raised will help our orchestra:

Production and start-up costs
Orchestral musicians and soloist fee
Venue hire – St. Sepulchre-without-Newgate (National Musicians’ Church)
Music Hire – Elgar and Sibelius Symphony No. 5
Advertising through local and national press and publicity
Providing music for Tower Hamlets community and Bow Boys School, including parents from underprivileged areas.

<h3>What happened?!</h3>
<p>On the evening of August 16th 2013, just 1 day after the APU chapel band retreat, where the instruments were being used, Corey's car was stolen. </p>
<p>The car was retrieved the next day, but quite a bit of valuable gear was stolen and not recovered.</p>
<p><i>Much of the gear was borrowed</i>. </p>
<p>With a large insurance deductible, we are left paying for replacement instruments out of pocket. We simply cannot afford any of these items. </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What Was Taken?</h3>
<p>Here's a list of the stolen goods</p>
<ul>
<li>James Brooks' banjo (Talmage)</li>
<li>The Wild Reeds Harmonium &amp; Road Case</li>
<li>Natalie Nicoles' Glockenspiel (Branches)</li>
<li>James &amp; Corey's 3 violin bows</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p></p>

What happened?!
On the evening of August 16th 2013, just 1 day after the APU chapel band retreat, where the instruments were being used, Corey's car was stolen. 
The car was retrieved the next day, but quite a bit of valuable gear was stolen and not recovered.
Much of the gear was borrowed. 
With a large insurance deductible, we are left paying for replacement instruments out of pocket. We simply cannot afford any of these items. 


What Was Taken?
Here's a list of the stolen goods

James Brooks' banjo (Talmage)
The Wild Reeds Harmonium & Road Case
Natalie Nicoles' Glockenspiel (Branches)
James & Corey's 3 violin bows



Financial Breakdown
Long story short: This is our job and without our instruments we can't work and pay our bills. All of these instruments are vital parts to the bands affected and we wouldn't be asking for your help if we didn't really need it!

<h3>The Mission</h3>
<p>The Bonazzoli Band has been playing live and releasing albums since the late 1980's.  It's time to take their sound to the next level and promote their music to a national audience.  </p>

</div>
<div>
<h3>How You Can Help</h3>
<p>We're trying to raise money to give our seventh album a proper release.  We've always been a self funded band with limited exposure and that has kept us relatively unknown nationally even with our local popularity.   By a ""proper release"" we mean a quality CD and digital album, music videos to promote it and a marketing budget to advertise and build on our success.</p>
<p>We've set out some great perks from copies of the album, credits on the album artwork, live performances and music lessons from the band and more.  </p>
<p>Regardless if we reach our funding goal or not, every penny raised will still go into the production and release of the new album.  We will get this album finished and on the market as soon as possible.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Results</h3>
<p>Have you ever wondered what's new in music?  What's out there that could get people of all ages excited?  Well, you can be a part of something big.  The Bonazzoli Band combines the best of 20th century music: Rock, swing, blues, country and gospel into an amazing new sound that almost everyone can enjoy.</p>

<p>This current album has been a 25 year journey.  The new album is called American Ghost Stories and it is a follow up to our 2010 release Quiet Little Towns.  Although our last album was critically praised and well received by fans the band was beset by tragedy with the loss of two band members during it's long production and early tour and this led to a fragmented release at best.  We hope to honor all of those people who have helped us out along the way with a proper release for this album and the upcoming singles.</p>

<p>We are 6 music therapists who just graduated from Berklee College of Music, and 2 music therapists with over 20 years of experience. We'll be in Guadalajara, Mexico from October 28th to November 1st to give free music therapy sessions to promote medical music therapy in Guadalajara.</p>
<p>Music therapy is the clinical, non-invasive, familiar and predictable use of music that uses the patient's needs and musical preference to work on goals and objectives of various domains. It is accesible to invididuals of all ages and different diagnoses, and is based on the evidence of musical interventions that aim to reach individual goals within a therapeutic relationship between a patient and a credentialed professional.</p>
<p>In the United States, the American Music Therapy Association (AMTA) serves as an advocate for music therapy on the state and federal laws, promotes music therapy through social media streams, publishes two research journals, among other things.</p>
<p>At the moment, music therapy in Mexico doesn't have the support of any association and medical music therapy is not a known intervention. The goal of this project is to introduce it to the medical community in public and private hospitals as a way to open the road for music therapy in Mexico.</p>

more blessed and lucky to have had the opportunity to have met and 
entertained so many of you that have reached out to us and shown us 
support online. Our journey thus far has taken us on many

as Seattle and Bellingham wa.<br/>
We are Til All Is One and our philosophy is the same as the name 
suggests. It's about unification and solidarity and just basically doing
 and playing what feels right, regardless of typical molds.<br/>
With every place that we've played and seen as well as the people that 
we've met along the way we've grown and changed as a band; as is the 
rule of experience. The point is to keep trudging the road and gaining 
more and more experience and in turn sharing the joy of creating this 
music with all of you.<br/>
We've recently downsized to a three piece unit but in many ways it's 
spawned a rebirth and a revitalization of the band- Getting back to 
basics while at the same time continuing to expand our collaborative and
 creative efforts.<br/>
This new ep which is slated to be aptly titled ""Trifecta"", is a 
culmination of all of the ebb and flow of our journey as a band and we 
want you to help be a part of it. The record will be produced by the 
Prolific Mr. Danny Balistocky (revolution 9 studios Hollywood ca) and we
 couldn't be more excited to work with him. We have already begun the 
pre-production proceedings which tipped us off to the fact that we work 
really well with Danny. We truly believe that this will be our greatest 
sonic effort to date and to be able to share this experience with our 
friends, fans and family will make this record all the more special. 
It's a safe bet to say that this ep will fully represent the 
multidimensional level of songwriting, musical influences, and even some
 of our quirky humor and spirit. All we ask is that you find it in your 
hearts (and a little bit in your wallets as well) to continue on showing
 us the support you have in past times and to help us fund this labor of
 love. We have a slew of different incentives!!.. and of course the 
larger the donation the greater the reward. So please help us reach our 
goal of 3k and let's get this upcoming EP playing in the headphones of 
anyone with a working set of eardrums. If you are unable to contribute that is ok, please spread the word of our campaign and share with your friends. Thanks Again!<br/><br/><br/><p></p><p></p><br/></div>","The interesting thing as that for most of our lives and long before we

The 'One Of These Days' campaign

In 2012, thanks to your help and generous crowdfunding contributions, we recorded our debut album, 'The Little We Know' after a successful Indiegogo campaign. We hope that if you are reading this it means you enjoyed the album and you believe that the money you invested in us was well spent. In case you need a reminder of our music, here’s our award winning video for God Gamble:

We are now ready to record our second album (hooray!). As mentioned above, our campaign target is £6,000. This money will help us cover two thirds of the costs for the project. This includes recording, mixing and mastering the album; printing CDs, T-shirts and tote bags, as well as pressing the album in glorious vinyl.
What You Get in return: 'One Of These Days' T-Shirts, Vinyl, CDs, Tote bags !!!

We've listened to your comments from our previous campaign and this time we’ve included perks featuring T-shirts and tote bags. By popular demand, for passionate music fans and collectors we’re going to print vinyl albums; and for those who'd like something graceful to adorn their living room wall, we will be preparing a framed Yossarian signed vinyl record as part of the Platinum Package. There are also 2 original paintings available as well the opportunity to pick a song for us to record if you're feeling particularly generous. You’ll find all the perks detailed in the column on the right. 
Just as we did with our previous campaign, the names of absolutely everyone who contributes will have their name featured within the album sleeve.

Additional Perks & Requests
We will be adding new perks during the course of the campaign and we would also be delighted to hear from you regarding any particular perk requests you may have. We aim to be as accommodating as possible, even if you'd like us to play a gig in your living room.

This is how the T-shirts and tote bags may look:





This is how the framed vinyl may look:





These paintings were created exclusively for our debut album 'The Little We Know' in 2012. They are the only 2 that remain from the original 10. As well as sending you these beautiful paintings, we will also send you a set of 10 art prints from our debut album campaign in addition of course to all of the other perks available as part of this current campaign.


Cost breakdown:


Release Date: Spring/Summer 2015 
We learnt a lot during the recording of our debut album in 2012 and will be using that experience during this project to ensure that we have 'One Of These Days' completed and ready for your listening pleasure by next summer. 

Thanks for your support and please get in touch if you have any questions.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<div>Brown Sugar A Cappella was founded at Northwestern University in 1999 as the world's first South Asian co-ed a cappella group by two students who wished to express their South Asian roots through music. Since the group's founding, Brown Sugar has gone on to showcase nationally from Bhangra in the Burgh in Pittsburgh to performances in St. Louis and Ann Arbor as well as participate and receive accolades at national competitions. In 2010 and 2011, Brown Sugar was awarded First Place at Gathe Raho, the nation's largest South Asian a cappella competition. In addition to live performances, the group has released three studio albums – <em>Pehla Nasha</em>, <em>Rhythm Room</em>, and <em>Cubed</em> – and is currently working on a fourth album, which will hopefully be released in spring 2013.</div>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get </h3>
</div>
<div>
<div>The album-making endeavor is costly, and in order to achieve our goal of releasing a new album in the spring of 2013, we need to raise $4,000 to finance the rest of our recording and production efforts. In exchange for your support, we have lined up some exciting perks that we think you'll really enjoy - from an early release of one of our favorite songs off the new album (a mix of Shukran Allah/Halo) to having us arrange a song of your choice and sing it for you!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We would be honored and extremely grateful for any support you can provide us. With your help – our friends, family, and fans – we will will finally be able to complete a four-year-long recording effort, and have the ability to share our music with the world.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please make a pledge to support us with any amount. You are an integral element of our success, and we can't accomplish this without you!</div>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Brown Sugar A Cappella was founded at Northwestern University in 1999 as the world's first South Asian co-ed a cappella group by two students who wished to express their South Asian roots through music. Since the group's founding, Brown Sugar has gone on to showcase nationally from Bhangra in the Burgh in Pittsburgh to performances in St. Louis and Ann Arbor as well as participate and receive accolades at national competitions. In 2010 and 2011, Brown Sugar was awarded First Place at Gathe Raho, the nation's largest South Asian a cappella competition. In addition to live performances, the group has released three studio albums – Pehla Nasha, Rhythm Room, and Cubed – and is currently working on a fourth album, which will hopefully be released in spring 2013.


What We Need & What You Get 


The album-making endeavor is costly, and in order to achieve our goal of releasing a new album in the spring of 2013, we need to raise $4,000 to finance the rest of our recording and production efforts. In exchange for your support, we have lined up some exciting perks that we think you'll really enjoy - from an early release of one of our favorite songs off the new album (a mix of Shukran Allah/Halo) to having us arrange a song of your choice and sing it for you!
 
We would be honored and extremely grateful for any support you can provide us. With your help – our friends, family, and fans – we will will finally be able to complete a four-year-long recording effort, and have the ability to share our music with the world.
 
Please make a pledge to support us with any amount. You are an integral element of our success, and we can't accomplish this without you!
 
As an added bonus, no matter how much you choose to contribute, we will put up a personalized thank you shout-out on our Facebook and Twitter!

<p><strong>BIOGRAPHIE</strong></p>
<p>Rise Of Doom est un jeune groupe de
Metalcore Grenoblois. </p>
<p>Formé en 2009, Rise Of Doom se
lance immédiatement dans la composition, en cherchant à donner vie à son
imaginaire et à créer son propre univers. </p>
<p>Le groupe commence par se produire localement. En 2012, Rise Of Doom
décide de sortir son premier opus : un EP de 4 titres enregistré chez
CORROSIVE RECORDS, suivi d’un clip live en 2013, réalisé par MARTIN REVIRON,
sur le titre UNDEAD’S EYES. Mais le groupe gagne rapidement en maturité et en
notoriété rendant ce premier EP obsolète. </p>
<p>Aujourd’hui, le groupe impose son
propre style à travers des influences telles que Betraying The Martyrs, The
Browning ou encore Caliban. Les titres se distinguent par leur atmosphère
épique et mélodique très marquée. Guidés par un chant saturé et un chant clair,
ils nous emportent dans un monde où la Terre se retrouve littéralement dévastée
par le poison de la nature humaine.</p>
<p>A son actif, Rise Of Doom compte de
nombreuses dates en France et l’opportunité de partager la scène avec des
groupes tels que Atlantis Chronicles, Shoot The Girl First, Everytime I Die
(US), Devil Sold His Soul (UK), Vera Cruz, The Walking Dead Orchestra, ou
encore Nightmare.</p>
<p>Désormais, Rise Of Doom compte deux
nouvelles recrues talentueuses : un second guitariste, Anthony, et le batteur, Tom, sortis tout droit de la Music Academy International.</p>

<br/><p>Monarch Sky is a female fronted alternative metal group from Edmonton, Alberta,
Canada. The band formed in 2012 and is comprised of Brandy Black on lead
 vocals, Jason Cullen on guitar / back up vocals, Jeremy Pond on bass 
guitar - back up vocals, and Mike Belitsky on drums.</p>
<p><br/> Although 
currently unsigned, Monarch Sky has moved mountains in a short period of time. Since
 joining forces in 2012, they have headlined out of town
 shows and local music festivals, they released their EP titled ""Embryo""
 in June 2013, toured western Canada in the summer of 2013 to promote 
their EP, and were nominated for “Metal Recording Of The Year” for their
 song “Circles” at the 2013 Edmonton Music Awards. </p>
<p><br/> Their 
performance is a sight to be witnessed live; Monarch Sky shares a 
powerful connection on stage both musically and lyrically. Their sound 
has been compared to a mix between Evanesence and Tool, with some 
musical influences being Tool, Chevelle, Deftones, Lacuna Coil...etc</p>

</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<br/>There of course is a chance that we won't reach our goal, if this happens we will still receive the funds raised. Depending how short we are from our goal there's a chance we won't be able to finish our recording right away. If this happens, your money will be going toward our recording regardless. Perhaps we won't be able to complete the album as quickly as we had hoped, but we will get as much done as we can and try to cover as much of the leftover cost as we possibly can. The greatest downfall to this happening is that it may set back our delivery time a bit, so please be patient. <br/><br/>If everything goes as planned, we will be recording in September and will hopefully be ready for the album release in late November 2014. <br/><br/>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<br/>We can't stress it enough how important it is to support your local music scene. Besides your financial contribution, the best way you can help is to attend our live shows, rock out with us, and buy our merch. This goes for not just us, but any other band that you love. If music is important to you, then attending shows should be too, because YOU are what keeps us doing what we love! <br/><br/>You can also help by spreading the word about Monarch Sky!<br/><br/>Here are some links:<br/><br/>Website: <a href=""http://www.monarchsky.ca"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.monarchsky.ca</a><br/>Facebook: <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/monarchsky"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.facebook.com/monarchsky</a><br/>Soundcloud: <a href=""http://www.soundcloud.com/monarch-sky"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.soundcloud.com/monarch-sky</a><br/>Reverbnation: <a href=""http://www.reverbnation.com/monarchsky"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.reverbnation.com/monarchsky</a><br/>Twitter: <a href=""http://www.twitter.com/monarchskymusic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.twitter.com/monarchskymusic</a><br/>YouTube: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/monarchskymusic"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.youtube.com/monarchskymusic</a><br/>Instagram: <a href=""http://www.instagram.com/monarchsky"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.instagram.com/monarchsky</a><br/><br/><br/>

  Risks & Challenges
There of course is a chance that we won't reach our goal, if this happens we will still receive the funds raised. Depending how short we are from our goal there's a chance we won't be able to finish our recording right away. If this happens, your money will be going toward our recording regardless. Perhaps we won't be able to complete the album as quickly as we had hoped, but we will get as much done as we can and try to cover as much of the leftover cost as we possibly can. The greatest downfall to this happening is that it may set back our delivery time a bit, so please be patient. If everything goes as planned, we will be recording in September and will hopefully be ready for the album release in late November 2014. 
  Other Ways You Can Help
We can't stress it enough how important it is to support your local music scene. Besides your financial contribution, the best way you can help is to attend our live shows, rock out with us, and buy our merch. This goes for not just us, but any other band that you love. If music is important to you, then attending shows should be too, because YOU are what keeps us doing what we love! You can also help by spreading the word about Monarch Sky!Here are some links:Website: www.monarchsky.caFacebook: www.facebook.com/monarchskySoundcloud: www.soundcloud.com/monarch-skyReverbnation: www.reverbnation.com/monarchskyTwitter: www.twitter.com/monarchskymusicYouTube: www.youtube.com/monarchskymusicInstagram: www.instagram.com/monarchsky

My name is Grace, and I am currently attending Madison Media Institute working toward a bachelor’s degree in Entertainment and Media Business. To help me expand and apply the knowledge I’m acquiring during school, I’ve started this page to help raise money so I can attend the largest film and music festival of the year—South by Southwest, or SXSW. <div>
<br/><div> What is South by Southwest? </div>
<div> SXSW is an internationally known set of film and music festivals, along with interactive conferences, based in Austin, Texas.
	The music aspect of the festival is quite a large event, as there are near 2,000 bands placing shows simultaneously throughout the venue during the week. One thing that is super cool to me is the fact that when you—as an artist—attend SXSW, you have to find your own way there and are in charge of your own keep. I feel this gives the festival its authenticity. </div>
<div> The film festival is just as widespread, with many indie directors bringing new films and ideas to the table. SXSW features many different filmmakers and voices in search for the newest wave of film.
	Now the conferences and interactions are what I truly want to attend! The amount of emerging technology ideas that SXSW discusses is just amazing to me. The focus on creative ideas is very welcoming and exciting to someone aspiring to work in the business of media entertainment. Going to SXSW, I’d know I’d be going to a place that is not just looking for the “next best thing” but is striving to better what emerging artists have to offer now. Welcoming new technology and finding new ways of not just communication but everyday life is something I crave! I could really go on and on about this, but if you would like to look at more about the conference here’s a great link:
		<a href=""http://sxsw.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://sxsw.com</a> </div>
<div> This campaign is an opportunity to help me achieve a goal to not only gain a once in a lifetime opportunity, but to help me further my education in this field and network with like-minded artists. This is a place to learn from and meet a diverse group of people who can help me invest and strengthen my knowledge and experience. My goal is to gain as much knowledge from professionals in the field and enjoy some brand new music and film at the same time!
	I will be taking this opportunity to make a short documentary about what I experience during SXSW, as well as the journey to and from the festival! It'll be a great way for you to see just how awesome and productive this experience will be for me.
	I do have a schedule of what I plan to attend, but I can't RSVP a spot until I buy a badge, and I can’t buy a badge until I raise enough money to attend. </div>
<div>That’s why I need your help!
	Examples of conferences I will attend are:
Digital Creative Job Markets, Using Emerging Tech, Using Emerging Technologies to Reach Your Audience, #ageofdamage: Be the Company You Want to Keep, Business Models for the Social Mobile Cloud, Equity: Making the Most of Your Other Paycheck, How to Rank Better in Google &amp; Bing, How Twitter Has Changed How We Watch TV, and that’s just to name a few!  
	Many of you know me personally and know my passion for technology and business...and my undying love for music of all types. I found my holy grail, and it's SXSW.<h1><span style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0.06em; line-height: 30px;"">What We Need</span></h1>
<p></p>For this trip we have an estimated cost of $4000.00 which includes gas, tolls, modest hotel accommodations, food, passes to SXSW, and basic upkeep of our car thats traveling across the US!  <p><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't donate any money to me, anything you have to offer to me would be helpful and greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Got a couch I could crash on? Lovely!</p>
<p>Want to invite me over for breakfast or dinner? I'll be there, I'll even help cook!</p>

The evening will feature works by Caccini, Purcell, Schubert, Brahms, Wolf, Fauré, and Satie, and the program will conclude with a tribute to a few favorite contemporary popular songs. I plan to make this a fun evening both for art song aficionados and friends new to the genre by creating a more immersive experience through projection, dance, and other surprises. With your support I can bring this unique program out of my head and into the concert hall. </p>
<p><span style=""line-height: 30px; font-size: 24px; font-weight: bold;"">About Me</span></p>
<p></p>I'm a
native of Hampton Roads who studied music at Virginia Wesleyan College and received a certificate in church music from the college's Center for Sacred Music before pursuing a Master of Divinity at Union Presbyterian Seminary. As a recitalist I participated in programs with the <a href=""http://www.artsongupdate.org/Reviews/VASS/VASS2.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Virginia Art Song Society</a>, was featured in VWC's <a href=""http://www.artsongupdate.org/Reviews/Artists/Elia&amp;Reinburg.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Familiar Faces Concert Series</a>, and founded<i> <a href=""http://www.artsongupdate.org/Reviews/VWC/VWC2.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Liedermorgen</a>,</i> an educational series designed to introduce German language students to <a href=""http://www.artsongupdate.org/Reviews/VWC/VWC3.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Kunstlieder</a>. I also produced several solo <a href=""http://www.artsongupdate.org/Reviews/Artists/CharlotteElia.htm"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">recitals of sacred music</a> while often returning to my great love of German art song. Most recently I appeared on the program of the <a href=""http://www.artsongupdate.org/Reviews/Trinity%20Lutheran/BachFest.htm#13abf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Bach Festival</a> at Trinity Lutheran Church in Norfolk, VA. As a candidate for ministry in the Presbyterian Church (PCUSA), I have served churches as a musician, teacher, and preacher, and I am currently filling the pulpit at Belle Haven Presbyterian Church in Belle Haven, VA. <br/> </div> <div>
<p> </p>
<h3>About the Campaign</h3> <p>I've long wanted to offer a program to both my new friends and those in the music community who have supported me, but recitals are expensive! Between renting a space, hiring an accompanist, buying sheet music, and working with coaches, it can be a daunting undertaking. And don't get me started on coordinating publicity and printing programs and finding something to wear! With your help I can produce this evening without being too deep in my own pockets and without burdening people with a ticket charge. I'd much prefer to offer free events so that this wonderful music remains accessible to all. </p>
<p>My goal of $700 covers the bulk of the expenses involved in renting the performance space and compensating my collaborative musician. I'll still be investing my own funds in many other aspects of this program. Your contributions would be greatly encouraging and help alleviate my fears that I'm squandering my savings on a vanity project.</p>
<p>This recital is happening. I've signed a contract on the theater. I've given sheet music to the pianist. I need your help now to make it the best evening it can be.</p>

<p>I'm hoping that you'll consider contributing the price of a concert ticket to this campaign, but as an added incentive, I've included an element of danger. All contributions include entries into a song raffle with the winner having the ability to choose a love song for this program. Do you have a favorite Schubert piece that you've never heard performed live? Can you think of a Billy Joel song that deserves more respect as an American standard? Do you think it could be potentially hilarious to hear me tackle a bit of Beyoncé? Challenge accepted. Anything goes as long as the song fits the broad topic of love and the music is accessible to the musicians. No opera.</p>
<p>You'll note that for a contribution of $100 you can skip the raffle and call your own tune. Three songs are available at this price, although you are welcome to offer a contribution at this level without claiming a song. Any songs not claimed will be added to the raffle thereby giving ticket holders additional chances to win their choice of song.</p>
<p>Does that sound crazy? Probably, but I'm running this campaign early to give us plenty of time both to rehearse your chosen songs and to program them so that they become a seamless part of our evening. This is a truly unique opportunity for you to make a very personal investment in the arts.</p>
<p>Please note that the raffle is now closed, and we drew the lucky winner on May 15, 2015. You can still support the recital with a contribution and see your name acknowledged at the program. </p>

</div></div>","About the Recital On August 22, 2015 at 8pm at the Hofheimer Theater at Virginia Wesleyan College I'll be offering a program of art songs in collaboration with Sharon Foxwell, pianist. The evening will feature works by Caccini, Purcell, Schubert, Brahms, Wolf, Fauré, and Satie, and the program will conclude with a tribute to a few favorite contemporary popular songs. I plan to make this a fun evening both for art song aficionados and friends new to the genre by creating a more immersive experience through projection, dance, and other surprises. With your support I can bring this unique program out of my head and into the concert hall. 
About Me
I'm a
native of Hampton Roads who studied music at Virginia Wesleyan College and received a certificate in church music from the college's Center for Sacred Music before pursuing a Master of Divinity at Union Presbyterian Seminary. As a recitalist I participated in programs with the Virginia Art Song Society, was featured in VWC's Familiar Faces Concert Series, and founded Liedermorgen, an educational series designed to introduce German language students to Kunstlieder. I also produced several solo recitals of sacred music while often returning to my great love of German art song. Most recently I appeared on the program of the Bach Festival at Trinity Lutheran Church in Norfolk, VA. As a candidate for ministry in the Presbyterian Church (PCUSA), I have served churches as a musician, teacher, and preacher, and I am currently filling the pulpit at Belle Haven Presbyterian Church in Belle Haven, VA.   
 
About the Campaign I've long wanted to offer a program to both my new friends and those in the music community who have supported me, but recitals are expensive! Between renting a space, hiring an accompanist, buying sheet music, and working with coaches, it can be a daunting undertaking. And don't get me started on coordinating publicity and printing programs and finding something to wear! With your help I can produce this evening without being too deep in my own pockets and without burdening people with a ticket charge. I'd much prefer to offer free events so that this wonderful music remains accessible to all. 
My goal of $700 covers the bulk of the expenses involved in renting the performance space and compensating my collaborative musician. I'll still be investing my own funds in many other aspects of this program. Your contributions would be greatly encouraging and help alleviate my fears that I'm squandering my savings on a vanity project.
This recital is happening. I've signed a contract on the theater. I've given sheet music to the pianist. I need your help now to make it the best evening it can be.

About That Raffle
I'm hoping that you'll consider contributing the price of a concert ticket to this campaign, but as an added incentive, I've included an element of danger. All contributions include entries into a song raffle with the winner having the ability to choose a love song for this program. Do you have a favorite Schubert piece that you've never heard performed live? Can you think of a Billy Joel song that deserves more respect as an American standard? Do you think it could be potentially hilarious to hear me tackle a bit of Beyoncé? Challenge accepted. Anything goes as long as the song fits the broad topic of love and the music is accessible to the musicians. No opera.
You'll note that for a contribution of $100 you can skip the raffle and call your own tune. Three songs are available at this price, although you are welcome to offer a contribution at this level without claiming a song. Any songs not claimed will be added to the raffle thereby giving ticket holders additional chances to win their choice of song.
Does that sound crazy? Probably, but I'm running this campaign early to give us plenty of time both to rehearse your chosen songs and to program them so that they become a seamless part of our evening. This is a truly unique opportunity for you to make a very personal investment in the arts.
Please note that the raffle is now closed, and we drew the lucky winner on May 15, 2015. You can still support the recital with a contribution and see your name acknowledged at the program.

I am currently studying Songwriting at McNally Smith College of Music in Saint Paul, where I have been recording my second EP! For any of you that don't know, ""EP"" stands for ""Extended Play"", which basically means you are getting a short CD with 3-5 songs. On this EP, titled ""Home"", there will be five songs PLUS a bonus remix! Four of these songs are brand new, written this year at McNally. </p>
<p>I am so excited to share this project with you because I have been very lucky to work with very talented people at McNally, and I know this will be the highest quality project that I have released yet. I previously released my own self-produced EP in July 2014. While the songs are still bearable, I can't stand to listen to the production (which I thought I knew how to do at the time). Here at McNally, I have had the pleasure of working with Eric Michael, a production student. He has put so much time into recording me, we only have one session left! I could not be more thrilled! </p>
<p>If I am able to reach my goal, you will have helped me release the biggest project that I have ever done..... And we have big hopes for this project. Once Eric has finished with the recording and production, I will send the tracks to Mozu Mastering in Connecticut to be mastered. Once they have been mastered, and I am ready to release the project, I will order physical copy's of the CD through CD Baby, and send it out to the digital distribution sites (such as iTunes, etc). </p> </div> <div> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<div>The new songs on this EP are very personal to me. I have written from the heart, and the songs say exactly what I want them to. I am extremely proud of this project. Eric and the other musicians on the project have all worked for free up until this point, using this project as a learning experience. However, I would like to be able to repay them in some way.<br/>
</div> <p>I will break the costs down for you:</p>
<p>Mozu Mastering, a company in CT, has offered to master my EP as their contribution for my campaign! WAHOOO. </p>
<p>-$50 to pay my drummer, Dan May</p>
<p>-$50 to pay my guitarist, Trevor Ohlsen</p>
<p>-$50 to pay my bassist, Joe Barron</p>
<p>-$300+ to order 100-200 physical copies of the EP with colored sleeves. Cover will be done by my younger sister, Lindsay. </p>
<p>-$100 for Digital Distribution to iTunes and other sites. </p>
<p>-$50 to register these songs on ASCAP to get the copyrights. </p>
<p>-The remaining $400 will be divided into Promoting this album and getting my name out there, and a music video of some kind. </p>
<p>-There will be perks for the different contributions you make. These perks may include a physical copy of the CD bundled with a copy of the first one, pins of different logo designs I have, a personal song written for you (topic of your choice), and more!</p>
<p>If I am unable to reach at least 50% of my goal, I will use what I have made to pay the musicians and people who have worked so hard on this project.</p>
<p>If I reach more than that, but not 100%, I will use what I can to cover part of the physical duplication, and pay the people who have worked so hard on this project.</p>
<p>If I am able to raise MORE than 100% of my goal.... HALLELUJAH I will be eternally grateful, and be able to afford every goal listed above and more. PLUS you will receive one or more of the perks listed!</p> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>As a young songwriter, I am learning that the music industry is ever-changing. I don't need to go into a professional studio to record and release an EP. There are SO many resources at my fingertips! It's harder to just ""get famous"" now- and you should know, that I am not trying to be completely famous. If I am able to make enough money to support myself and whatever family I will have around me, I will consider that success. I really value my personal life and privacy. (Of course I want to win a Grammy too, but we take it one dream at a time) I have access to these incredible professional-level studios at McNally, where we have recorded the entire EP. Why should you contribute? As musicians and supporters of the arts, I think it is so important to pay attention to the aspiring youth that surround us. I am ready to start chasing this goal at full speed. </p>
<p>How can you trust my motivation? Let me tell you that I have achieved almost every goal that I have ever set out to do. I face every challenge head-on, and I won't stop until I am satisfied. In summer 2011 I was fortunate enough to attend Interlochen Arts Camp, and I knew when I got home that I had to go back the next summer. I was accepted into their two-week High School Songwriting program. The camp tuition was expensive, but I knew what I had to do. With a bake sale, pasta dinner, and carwash, I was able to raise $3000 in two weeks. I was fortunate to attend camp at Interlochen that summer and go on to attend two years at Interlochen Arts Academy, where I graduated from a year early, in May 2014.</p>
<p>I don't like to give up, and you can trust that I won't do that this time. This goal is just as important to me as fundraising for my tuition at Interlochen, and every other goal that I have tried to achieve. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>There are risks to this fundraiser, as there are to anything in life. Putting myself out there is scary! However, I have learned that as a young songwriter in the music industry, putting myself out in the open is the only way to achieve my goals. </p> <ul> <li>I am determined to reach this goal. This project means everything to me. I have had a wonderful first year at McNally Smith College of Music, and I truly believe that these songs and connections I have made wouldn't have come about if I wasn't here. </li> <li>If you know me, or follow my Facebook page, ""Hailey Ward Music"", you can count on seeing a lot of this link. Don't let it annoy you, let it motivate you! If I can reach this goal, you can reach whatever dream you may be chasing right now!</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>I understand that not everyone is able to make a contribution, but that doesn't mean you can't help!</p> <ul> <li>Tell your friends and family about this project!</li> <li>SHARE this page on social media websites like Facebook and Twitter! Exposure is everything!</li>
<li>THANK YOU. Even just by clicking on this link, you have made an impact! I will never be able to fully express my gratitude for the support and love I have received. </li> </ul> </div> <p><br/></p></div>","Short Summary My name is Hailey Ward, and I am an 18 year old singer/songwriter from Williston, Vermont.

This is an amazing opportunity for our adventurous and skilled young students to see and be
 seen by the early-music community. <br/></span></p>
<p></p>
<h3>About the show</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p>Alcina is a tale of sorcery and adventure. SHAK's adaptation of this 
Baroque masterwork – delightful for adults and kids alike – is a revival of our successful 2014 performance. It's a one-hour spoken 
play enriched with a sparkling dozen and a half of the best arias, choruses, and dances
 from
Handel's opera. A cast of singers and actors aged 6-17 take center 
stage,
accompanied by a chamber orchestra of professional Baroque violins, 
cello,
theorbo and harpsichord. The story is told by Ludovico Ariosto, 
author of
the 16th-century tale that inspired the opera, in competition with the 
visiting
Handel himself. Sparks fly as Renaissance and Baroque visions collide, 
and
there's even a duel or two in period style!</p>
<h3>Why this project matters</h3>
<p>In Alcina, as in all of our projects, kids are empowered to connect with history and bring it to life. Imagining oneself into the past is a cross-cultural experience that develops sensitivity, imagination, and compassion. All of our students are learning about the craft of performance, working with experts in the field, and taking their places in the chain of people keeping these old arts alive for future generations.<br/></p>
<p>Our young performers are sure to
 be inspired for the rest of their lives by what they see and hear at 
the festival. Alcina is the ""jewel in our crown,"" and we hope that sharing it will inspire more high-quality historical-arts 
education for young people. <strong>There is simply no other program anywhere that does what we do! </strong>At the Festival, Shula will be honored with Early Music America's 2015 <a href=""https://www.earlymusicamerica.org/what-we-do/awards/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Laurette Goldberg Award</a> for education, in recognition of this work. <strong><br/></strong></p>

<h3>In their own words</h3>
<h3></h3>
<p><i>“Things I value most about SHAK
are the people, the music and all the hard effort. I
developed the skills to sing, dance and talk in public. You really get to know all
the other people, so the cast feels almost like a family.” --Cast member, age 12</i><br/></p>
<i>""For me, SHAK serves as a kind of time machine. I could have been born in
 the baroque time period and it would have worked out fine. And I think 
anyone who's interested in Baroque opera is kind of inherently 
awesome."" --Cast member, age 11</i><br/><br/>
<i>""I’m so impressed with SHAK’s ability not just to teach material but to 
thoughtfully engage each kid. They have a real knack for seeing each 
kid’s strengths and finding, or creating, roles for them, which creates a
 group that is really able to shine. SHAK is encouraging a life-long 
engagement with history and early music, and in the process our kids are
 learning to navigate a group with integrity and a strong sense of self."" --Parent of two cast members</i><br/> <p></p>

<ul></ul> </div> <div> <h3>Our funding goal<br/>
</h3> <p>We begin with good news: with the generosity of our supporters close by, we've raised over $9,000 already, in just eight weeks! We have about another $5,000 to raise by June. <b>Gifts can be made either through Indiegogo or via our fiscal sponsor (see below) -- hence a goal of only $4,000 for the Indiegogo campaign itself. </b><br/></p>
<p>Early Music America gives us a venue to perform in and publicizes the event; in return, they keep the door money. All other expenses are up to us to cover. We're taking the opportunity of this revival performance to add (and learn, and stage...) a couple of great vocal numbers. We're also spending a lot more time with a vocal coach -- the great Nancy Zylstra -- and with live instrumental accompaniment in rehearsals. Here are the things donations will pay for:<br/></p> <ul> <li>Costumes: fabric, shoes, wigs, ready-made costumes, custom sewing fees<br/>
</li> <li>Directorial staff time: Stage director Carmen Mettler; project director and music director Shulamit Kleinerman<br/>
</li> <li>Guest coaches: Vocal coach Nancy Zylstra, fencing coach Cecil Longino</li>
<li>Musical accompanists: Our Seattle rehearsal players on baroque violins, cello, theorbo, and harpsichord<br/>
</li>
<li>Musicians to play for the performance in Boston<br/>
</li>
<li>Rehearsal space rental, March-June<br/>
</li>
<li>Travel &amp; lodging costs for directorial staff</li>
<li>Those little things that add up: costume shipping/checking, program printing...</li>
<li>Travel scholarships for families who need them</li>
</ul>
<p>What about the cost of getting to Boston? Most families are paying their
 own travel expenses. All participating families have donated to the 
artistic budget in some way, with an average donation of almost $300 per
 cast member. There's a tremendous amount of commitment and dedication 
behind this project!

<i>""People should come to our performance because they could be a part of reviving history."" --Cast member, age 12</i><br/><br/>***<br/><br/>SHAK is a proud program of <a href=""http://shunpike.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Shunpike</a>.<br/> </div></div>","June 5 update: Thanks to all of our donors so far through Indiegogo and Shunpike! Between the two venues we've raised the first $12,000 and have about $2,000  left to raise by June 12. We're so excited as we get closer to the goal that makes this great project possible, and we hope you can join us!Meet the youngest (ever?) performers at BEMF
 Join us on June 12 at First Church Boston to see our Handel opera adaptation for all ages! Early Music America is presenting Seattle Historical Arts for Kids on the Young Performers' Festival, side
 by side with some of the nation's finest college-level early music 
ensembles. Our cast of kids and teens will be right in the midst of the Boston Early Music Festival, hailed by The Times (London) as ""the world's leading festival of early music."" This is an amazing opportunity for our adventurous and skilled young students to see and be
 seen by the early-music community. 

About the show

Alcina is a tale of sorcery and adventure. SHAK's adaptation of this 
Baroque masterwork – delightful for adults and kids alike – is a revival of our successful 2014 performance. It's a one-hour spoken 
play enriched with a sparkling dozen and a half of the best arias, choruses, and dances
 from
Handel's opera. A cast of singers and actors aged 6-17 take center 
stage,
accompanied by a chamber orchestra of professional Baroque violins, 
cello,
theorbo and harpsichord. The story is told by Ludovico Ariosto, 
author of
the 16th-century tale that inspired the opera, in competition with the 
visiting
Handel himself. Sparks fly as Renaissance and Baroque visions collide, 
and
there's even a duel or two in period style!
Why this project matters
In Alcina, as in all of our projects, kids are empowered to connect with history and bring it to life. Imagining oneself into the past is a cross-cultural experience that develops sensitivity, imagination, and compassion. All of our students are learning about the craft of performance, working with experts in the field, and taking their places in the chain of people keeping these old arts alive for future generations.
Our young performers are sure to
 be inspired for the rest of their lives by what they see and hear at 
the festival. Alcina is the ""jewel in our crown,"" and we hope that sharing it will inspire more high-quality historical-arts 
education for young people. There is simply no other program anywhere that does what we do! At the Festival, Shula will be honored with Early Music America's 2015 Laurette Goldberg Award for education, in recognition of this work. 



In their own words

“Things I value most about SHAK
are the people, the music and all the hard effort. I
developed the skills to sing, dance and talk in public. You really get to know all
the other people, so the cast feels almost like a family.” --Cast member, age 12
""For me, SHAK serves as a kind of time machine. I could have been born in
 the baroque time period and it would have worked out fine. And I think 
anyone who's interested in Baroque opera is kind of inherently 
awesome."" --Cast member, age 11
""I’m so impressed with SHAK’s ability not just to teach material but to 
thoughtfully engage each kid. They have a real knack for seeing each 
kid’s strengths and finding, or creating, roles for them, which creates a
 group that is really able to shine. SHAK is encouraging a life-long 
engagement with history and early music, and in the process our kids are
 learning to navigate a group with integrity and a strong sense of self."" --Parent of two cast members 

   Our funding goal
 We begin with good news: with the generosity of our supporters close by, we've raised over $9,000 already, in just eight weeks! We have about another $5,000 to raise by June. Gifts can be made either through Indiegogo or via our fiscal sponsor (see below) -- hence a goal of only $4,000 for the Indiegogo campaign itself. 
Early Music America gives us a venue to perform in and publicizes the event; in return, they keep the door money. All other expenses are up to us to cover. We're taking the opportunity of this revival performance to add (and learn, and stage...) a couple of great vocal numbers. We're also spending a lot more time with a vocal coach -- the great Nancy Zylstra -- and with live instrumental accompaniment in rehearsals. Here are the things donations will pay for:  Costumes: fabric, shoes, wigs, ready-made costumes, custom sewing fees
 Directorial staff time: Stage director Carmen Mettler; project director and music director Shulamit Kleinerman
 Guest coaches: Vocal coach Nancy Zylstra, fencing coach Cecil Longino
Musical accompanists: Our Seattle rehearsal players on baroque violins, cello, theorbo, and harpsichord

Musicians to play for the performance in Boston

Rehearsal space rental, March-June

Travel & lodging costs for directorial staff
Those little things that add up: costume shipping/checking, program printing...
Travel scholarships for families who need them

What about the cost of getting to Boston? Most families are paying their
 own travel expenses. All participating families have donated to the 
artistic budget in some way, with an average donation of almost $300 per
 cast member. There's a tremendous amount of commitment and dedication 
behind this project! 


Ways to donate
Option 1. Here on our Indiegogo campaign. Advantage for you: Fun! Easy! We have perks! You'll see your name listed on our campaign (unless you prefer to be anonymous) and you'll watch the dollar ticker click toward our goal with your help.Option 2. Through our fiscal sponsor, Shunpike. Advantage for you: Shunpike is the way to go if you prefer for your donation to be tax-deductible. If your employer does matching for charitable donations, we would love for you to donate through Shunpike and make use of that opportunity. You can make a gift via Shunpike either by check or by credit card: Just visit http://historicalarts.org/support.All donations made through either venue reach SHAK, minus a modest processing percentage in both cases.  Other ways you can help
 Please help spread the word -- about SHAK in general or this campaign in particular. We're very happy for others to know about what we're doing, and we hope to inspire more in-depth historical arts work with young people.  Share news of our work with your friends: historicalarts.org

<p>Hello folks we are the Wandering Sons, a Glasgow-based band of full time musicians who make a living exploring, wandering and playing music at the side of the street. We are looking to fund the recording of a new EP featuring a whole bunch of fresh music that we have been working hard on over the last year and are very excited to share with you.</p>
<p>We feel incredibly lucky to have had the opportunity to perform over the last two years, not many people can say that they love their career choice as much as we do. And while we do have the occasional rough day –everyone does – it’s still a blessing to meet and perform for so many wonderful people.</p>
<p> This EP has been in the works for a while now, however recently life has been getting in the way a wee bit with valuable equipment being damaged and other various setbacks.

<p>We’re looking to raise £4,500 in total. All of the money raised will be used for; a producer, mixing &amp; mastering, session musicians, equipment hire, CD production and artist fees.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, a whole heap of work, time and talented people are required to record and produce an EP so anything that you can offer is greatly appreciated! If you can’t contribute – don’t worry, you can still help by sharing this page via the social media platform of your choice.</p>

artist, with a bluesy, soulful edge. Musically, I’ve accomplished amazing
things, and the only reason, I’ve come this far, is because of incredible
support from people like you! I’m so very grateful to all of my generous fans,
friends, and supporters, for getting me this far. Music has always been a part
of who I am. For as long as I can remember, I knew that creating and performing
was my calling. I have trained extensively in acting, dance, and music. I
Studied voice for 15 years privately, and I attended college at the musical
theater conservatory, PCPA. After college, I focused my energy back on my true
passion, music. I moved to Nashville two years ago to pursue my dream
full-time, and learn the business from the inside out, and it has been a whirlwind
of a time in a lot of great ways! Now it’s time to take things to the next
level! </span></p>

<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: .5in;""><span style=""color: #262626;"">I recorded a brand new single, called FREE FALL, in
August, and released it in October. This single has been gaining traction in
the music business, (top 5 on Music Road Radio, indie label offers, publisher
interest). In order to maximize its full potential, I plan to bolster its visibility
through a secondary market radio campaign. And, because my fans have been
itching for more new music, I plan on recording a complete FREE FALL, EP. This
funding goal will allow me to record 3 new songs, along with the necessary
promotion. This is extremely expensive, but together I know we can make it
happen! </span></p><p></p><p></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: .5in;""><span style=""color: #262626;"">After moving to Nashville, I quickly learned that the
only way to “make it” in today’s business is to make it happen yourself. It is
no longer about being discovered, but about creating your own business that
thrives so much that a label might want to buy into what you have already
begun. So, I started to build my business. Although I have experienced a lot of
success on my own the last couple of years, both touring in more than 7 states,
growing my fan base, and even gaining some airplay internationally, the
challenge is that I’ve been doing all of this business work myself. This
includes: marketing, booking, writing, radio promotion, practice/shows,
recording, updating my website, and running my social media. Although I can do
these things, I can’t do all of them effectively by myself. I know that I’m at
the point that I need help from some industry pros to move to the next level.
Unfortunately the promotional help I need costs a lot of money. This is why I
need your help.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: .5in;""><span style=""color: #262626;"">Hear FREE FALL here: <a href=""https://soundcloud.com/brittany-bexton/free-fall-mp3"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://soundcloud.com/brittany-bexton/free-fall-mp3</a></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""text-indent: .5in;""><b style=""""><u><span style=""color: #262626;"">Cost

Personal IntroductionHey y’all, I’m Brittany Bexton, a Nashville country
artist, with a bluesy, soulful edge. Musically, I’ve accomplished amazing
things, and the only reason, I’ve come this far, is because of incredible
support from people like you! I’m so very grateful to all of my generous fans,
friends, and supporters, for getting me this far. Music has always been a part
of who I am. For as long as I can remember, I knew that creating and performing
was my calling. I have trained extensively in acting, dance, and music. I
Studied voice for 15 years privately, and I attended college at the musical
theater conservatory, PCPA. After college, I focused my energy back on my true
passion, music. I moved to Nashville two years ago to pursue my dream
full-time, and learn the business from the inside out, and it has been a whirlwind
of a time in a lot of great ways! Now it’s time to take things to the next
level! 
What We Need & What You Get
What the Campaign is for 
I recorded a brand new single, called FREE FALL, in
August, and released it in October. This single has been gaining traction in
the music business, (top 5 on Music Road Radio, indie label offers, publisher
interest). In order to maximize its full potential, I plan to bolster its visibility
through a secondary market radio campaign. And, because my fans have been
itching for more new music, I plan on recording a complete FREE FALL, EP. This
funding goal will allow me to record 3 new songs, along with the necessary
promotion. This is extremely expensive, but together I know we can make it
happen! 
After moving to Nashville, I quickly learned that the
only way to “make it” in today’s business is to make it happen yourself. It is
no longer about being discovered, but about creating your own business that
thrives so much that a label might want to buy into what you have already
begun. So, I started to build my business. Although I have experienced a lot of
success on my own the last couple of years, both touring in more than 7 states,
growing my fan base, and even gaining some airplay internationally, the
challenge is that I’ve been doing all of this business work myself. This
includes: marketing, booking, writing, radio promotion, practice/shows,
recording, updating my website, and running my social media. Although I can do
these things, I can’t do all of them effectively by myself. I know that I’m at
the point that I need help from some industry pros to move to the next level.
Unfortunately the promotional help I need costs a lot of money. This is why I
need your help.Hear FREE FALL here: https://soundcloud.com/brittany-bexton/free-fall-mp3Cost
Breakdown
 I know $15,500 is a lot of
money, but the cost of promotion and recording is very expensive. Below I have
provided a breakdown of the costs, so that you can see with complete
transparency exactly where your contribution will be going.
 Radio Promo:

-$7,500 -  This
includes radio promotion, tracking spins/adds & charts, & advertising.
-$1,500 – Cost of CDX disc delivery to stations.
Cost to record:
-$6,450 – this includes mixing, mastering, tracking, studio
time, and production. 
Additional Costs:
-$1,000 – Cost to print CD’s
-$3,000 – Cost of the Perks
-$4,000 – Cost to book and go on a radio tour.
-$3,000 – Cost to make a music video for FREE FALL
-$2,150 – Cost to record a 4th song
        As you can see the costs add up quickly. You may have
noticed that I have expenses listed that aren’t included in my funding goal.
This is because I wanted to set a more reasonable goal to avoid the extra
expense from Indiegogo (9% vs. 4% if I don’t meet my goal). However, these
additional expenses are where the funding money will go if we exceed the goal.

 *These are the most reasonable costs I could find for
quality recording and promotion. The cost can be far more.

 Perks
          Enough about what I need! Have you

</h3> <p>For as long as we can remember, we (Jim Ambler and Pierce Peter Brandt) have been singing, acting, and dancing on stages from New York to California and beyond, in blockbuster Broadway productions, concerts, and professional regional theater. [For more details on our careers, scroll all the way down!]</p>
<p>We hit it off as pals when we were cast as the celebrity singing duo, ""Wallace and Davis"" in the hit stage version of the classic film, <i>White Christmas</i>. Our chemistry as singers, actors, and friends was a smash onstage and off, so we were inspired to keep the ball rolling, and the duo, Ambler &amp; Brandt, was born. Our musical focus is songs from Broadway, classic standards and great ""oldies,"" as well as light rock, popular music, and contemporary classics. <b><i>We need your help to launch Ambler &amp; Brandt and get this show on the road!</i></b><br/></p>
<p>Scroll down for photos and details of our <b>long list of fun PERKS</b> including <b>unique items for fans of Broadway musicals</b> from our engagements in the Broadway productions of <i>Les Misérables, Footloose, The Producers, Saturday Night Fever, Martin Guerre, </i>and <i>Jesus Christ Superstar.</i><br/></p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<h3>So what's the plan?<br/>
</h3>To launch our duo act and make it viable for a variety of venues, we're currently in the process of building three shows that will range from 45–75 minutes each. These shows will be aimed at bookings in cabarets and nightclubs, concert halls with pops orchestras, cruise ships, and other venues. Building shows of this nature is a labor of love that we are absolutely passionate about, as it is essentially a culmination of our combined, nearly four decades of work in the professional performing arts, working on all sides of the footlights (in addition to performing, we have also worked as directors, vocal directors, choreographers, and teaching artists).<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440048004/ib4ddvkit15kint9hy6m.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 233.256px; height: 118px;""/><br/></p>
<p>Our first show, <i>Two on the Boards,</i> will debut at one of San Francisco's top cabaret/nightclubs, <b><a href=""http://www.hotelnikkosf.com/feinsteins"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Feinstein's at the Nikko</a> on September 9, 2015</b>. [See a behind-the-scenes preview in the video!] <i>Two on the Boards</i> is something of a hybrid – it's a retrospective of songs from many of our Broadway shows, and it's a nod to some of the famous duos and duets of our time.<br/></p>
<p>Other shows in works include <i>Five O'Clock Shadow</i> (standards from classic crooners) and <i>Something's Gotta Give</i> (popular music and contemporary classics).<br/></p>
<p>Once we've made our debut in <i>Two on the Boards</i> at Feinstein's, we'll be seeking the right management company to represent us for bookings across the country and internationally.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>And what does it take to make it happen?<br/>
</h3>
<p>Art isn't easy, and it certainly isn't cheap! To get these shows up and running and ready for audiences, and then to pursue the right representation (management) there are significant costs involved...</p>

<li>
<b>Music Director</b><br/>For our first show, <i>Two on the Boards</i>, we've hired cabaret veteran, pianist, and music director extraordinaire, <a href=""http://www.billyphiladelphia.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Billy Philadelphia</a>. Billy is giving his expert guidance on creating the show and is writing the ""charts"" (see below) for the band, including custom arrangements of many of the songs. Billy will be at the piano for <i>Two on the Boards</i> at Feinstein's and is in charge of organizing the band. In the near future, we'll bring other music directors on board to help shape and build our other shows. When it comes to expert music directors (like Billy), their time, expertise, and finesse on the piano are like gold! A music director can make or break the show; it's as simple as that.<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Music Charts</b><br/>For every song that we'll perform, custom charts (sheet music) need to be made for each instrument in the band. For smaller venues, a trio is ideal, but for others more instruments will be needed. Some venues will have bands of around 8 pieces, while others may be around 12. Of course, pops orchestras will be much larger; anywhere from 20-65 pieces! And charts aren't cheap, especially if you want them done well.</li>
<li>
<b>Band (musicians)</b><br/>Good musicians expect good pay. For <i>Two on the Boards</i>, Billy Philadelphia is bringing on board some expert players: Chuck Bennett on bass, and Mark Rosengarden on drums. In the near future, when we work with larger bands, our cost for paying musicians will soar to new heights! And it's worth it!<br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Suits and Tuxedos<br/></b>A class act has to look classy! <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Photographs, Videos, and other Advertising/Promotion</b><br/>We created our first still photos and videos (such as those seen here) ourselves, learning our way as we went along. But, to promote ourselves for representation and future bookings, we'll need some great professional photos as well as professionally shot and edited promotional videos. <br/>
</li>
<li>
<b>Travel and Hotel</b><br/>Getting the show on the road is a multi-faceted journey! In the near future, we will likely be flying across the country to meet with potential managers. We'll also be traveling to and from rehearsal venues and show venues once the new bookings begin. Of course, travel costs add up fast!</li>

<p>I create experimental psychedelic trance under the name 'Satori'. In recent years I have moved from a laptop based studio to hardware.

My music is made on expensive instruments, which I fund myself, but now I am reaching out to my listeners to help my dream of creating an experience through my music continue to grow.
I create experimental psychedelic trance under the name 'Satori'. In recent years I have moved from a laptop based studio to hardware. I sold my record collection and anything else I could find with worth to fund my synth purchases and I have built up a nice modular system and have a few other things, but i've run out of things to sell!
If I have ever reached you through my music, please consider giving back. My music will only continue to grow through the support of the people who listen to it.
This is a flexible funding campaign so even if it doesn't reach the target the money will go into purchasing equipment for the studio.
   What I Need & What You Get
I am hoping to fund the purchase of a Dave Smith Pro 2 Analog Synthesizer. This instrument will be used as a central 'brain' of my studio, acting as synth, sequencer, effects and more.
This synth will be used in the creation of my upcoming album and any other future releases.
In return for pledges I will offer various rewards, from remix kits to exclusive unreleased music.
 I thank you for your time and support.

Regards
Rory.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

This is String of the Lost Boys writing to you once again with some fantastic news: we are on the verge of completing an urgent and long-standing goal of ours, the rerelease of <i>Bedlam</i>, our second CD, which has been out of print since the fall of 2008! </p><p><i>Bedlam</i> was a true milestone for us, recorded during our first real rush of success, the moment when we realized that we were actually on to something! We knew we had some good ideas when we recorded our first album, <i>Rogues in a Nation</i>, but <i>Bedlam</i> was created on the wave of energy that came from all of you in our audience, when we first experienced your enthusiasm and your amazing reaction to our music. For the past six years we've been working towards the moment when we could on once more present this important collection of songs to you, but we need your aid in completing the final stages of the process!</p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">This new edition of Bedlam will feature the talents of the original line up in all their glory: Clarence the Destroyer, Johnny Ozbourne, Michael Starr, and String, as well as some important contributions by current band members William, Son of William (we think) and Sgt. David Pepper Harrison-Harrison.  The many extras will include some long-missing documents from the 2002-2004 period, such as the Boys' studio rendition of the Star Bangled Banner (as performed at many a sporting event during the time), as well as ""Boys Only"" versions of ""My Reward,"" ""Kiss Me, You Fool,"" ""Alms for the Poor,"" and ""Loch Lomond.""   In addition, there will be 3 brand new songs specifically recorded for this collection, along with fan favorites ""Art Thou Ready?,"" ""Mystic Caravan,"" ""Bedlam Boys,"" and many, many more from the original release!</span><br/></p><p>The music itself is nearing finalization, but we need help raising the money to pay for the finished artwork ($500), to have the final audio mixed and mastered ($1000), and to have the CD’s physically manufactured ($2500); $4000 should do it! </p><p>Completion of this project will get us one step closer to having our entire catalog back in print, and allow us up to get on with the creation of a brand new full length album. So, the new <i>Bedlam</i> will serve both the old and the new: presenting once again a key document in our development as well as providing some new Teal Madness for you to enjoy!</p><p>We have once again devised numerous perks not only to thank you for your ongoing support, but also to help us get our new sounds into your hands as quickly as possible. There are lots of options to choose from, everything from a simple copy of the new record to a DVD of our 15th anniversary show (featuring 11 Lost Boys all on stage together) to an opportunity to actually appear on our next full length CD (<i>Seas of Fate</i>, due towards the end of 2015), so please choose an option below, and help us on our way!</p><p>We’re confident that we’ll all band together and meet our goal, but if for some reason we fall short, all of the money that does get raised will be used to finish as much of the CD as possible, while we continue to save our own pennies to complete the project. So all of the funds will go towards the cause, and your generous contributions will help us to get it done far sooner than we otherwise would be able to! </p><p>As we all know, the creation of new music is vital to the ongoing development of any group, and the Lost Boys have got a lot of material that we want to share with you. Raising the money to pay for the production of our albums is an ongoing challenge, but we think going the extra mile to present as high a quality of production as we can definitely pays off in the end. The extra time and care that we put into our records does cost more than it otherwise might, but the results sure speak for themselves. We just want to keep making these CD's, and with your support we've been able to get several titles out there in recent years: the new Rogues in a Nation in 2013, our Collected Quarto compilation in 2014, and now the rerelease of Bedlam in early 2015.

This is String of the Lost Boys writing to you once again with some fantastic news: we are on the verge of completing an urgent and long-standing goal of ours, the rerelease of Bedlam, our second CD, which has been out of print since the fall of 2008! Bedlam was a true milestone for us, recorded during our first real rush of success, the moment when we realized that we were actually on to something! We knew we had some good ideas when we recorded our first album, Rogues in a Nation, but Bedlam was created on the wave of energy that came from all of you in our audience, when we first experienced your enthusiasm and your amazing reaction to our music. For the past six years we've been working towards the moment when we could on once more present this important collection of songs to you, but we need your aid in completing the final stages of the process!This new edition of Bedlam will feature the talents of the original line up in all their glory: Clarence the Destroyer, Johnny Ozbourne, Michael Starr, and String, as well as some important contributions by current band members William, Son of William (we think) and Sgt. David Pepper Harrison-Harrison.  The many extras will include some long-missing documents from the 2002-2004 period, such as the Boys' studio rendition of the Star Bangled Banner (as performed at many a sporting event during the time), as well as ""Boys Only"" versions of ""My Reward,"" ""Kiss Me, You Fool,"" ""Alms for the Poor,"" and ""Loch Lomond.""   In addition, there will be 3 brand new songs specifically recorded for this collection, along with fan favorites ""Art Thou Ready?,"" ""Mystic Caravan,"" ""Bedlam Boys,"" and many, many more from the original release!The music itself is nearing finalization, but we need help raising the money to pay for the finished artwork ($500), to have the final audio mixed and mastered ($1000), and to have the CD’s physically manufactured ($2500); $4000 should do it! Completion of this project will get us one step closer to having our entire catalog back in print, and allow us up to get on with the creation of a brand new full length album. So, the new Bedlam will serve both the old and the new: presenting once again a key document in our development as well as providing some new Teal Madness for you to enjoy!We have once again devised numerous perks not only to thank you for your ongoing support, but also to help us get our new sounds into your hands as quickly as possible. There are lots of options to choose from, everything from a simple copy of the new record to a DVD of our 15th anniversary show (featuring 11 Lost Boys all on stage together) to an opportunity to actually appear on our next full length CD (Seas of Fate, due towards the end of 2015), so please choose an option below, and help us on our way!We’re confident that we’ll all band together and meet our goal, but if for some reason we fall short, all of the money that does get raised will be used to finish as much of the CD as possible, while we continue to save our own pennies to complete the project. So all of the funds will go towards the cause, and your generous contributions will help us to get it done far sooner than we otherwise would be able to! As we all know, the creation of new music is vital to the ongoing development of any group, and the Lost Boys have got a lot of material that we want to share with you. Raising the money to pay for the production of our albums is an ongoing challenge, but we think going the extra mile to present as high a quality of production as we can definitely pays off in the end. The extra time and care that we put into our records does cost more than it otherwise might, but the results sure speak for themselves. We just want to keep making these CD's, and with your support we've been able to get several titles out there in recent years: the new Rogues in a Nation in 2013, our Collected Quarto compilation in 2014, and now the rerelease of Bedlam in early 2015. Let's keep the trend going!Thank you so much for your support! Please choose a perk, and use Indiegogo's share tools to spread the word about our new project. As always, we couldn’t do this without you! Lots o’ love from all of us,The Lost Boys- String, Will, Bombast, Harry, & Asheen",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

For those who don't, my name is Evan Barlow. I am a 24 year old person in long term recovery. For me, this means I haven't used a drug or had a drink in over four years. Now, don't read this and take it the wrong way. Just because I don't drink doesn't mean I dislike people who do; it's just I can’t have a drink or use drugs of any kind, because of my addiction.</p><p>At the age of 16, I became addicted to heavy pain killers. Believe it or not, pills were a completely normal thing to experiment with, at that age, when I was growing up. Kids are being exposed to more and more drugs at an early age now a day. My addiction eventually progressed to the point where i became an IV heroin user. This was the drug that took me all the way down. After years and years of countless rehabs, jails, institutions, putting my family through all sorts of misery, lying, manipulating, and just all around torture, I finally got clean. It wasn't until I hit a very hard rock bottom that I finally made the decision to turn my life around. In early February of 2012, my mother passed away from a heart attack. At the time of her death, I was in jail for things I had done in my active addiction. I can’t even begin to describe the sense of loss, guilt, and hate that I felt, for myself, at this time in life. It's like a light went off in my head that was making me feel like I caused this. Her blood was on my hands; in my eyes. Because of my selfish, manipulative and addictive behavior, I now had to bury my mother. Since her death, I have not touched or taken one drink or used any drugs. This was truly was a blessing in disguise. I believe it was my “wake up call”. She was in much pain due to the fact she had undergone back surgery that left her bed ridden for years prior to her passing.

For those who don't, my name is Evan Barlow. I am a 24 year old person in long term recovery. For me, this means I haven't used a drug or had a drink in over four years. Now, don't read this and take it the wrong way. Just because I don't drink doesn't mean I dislike people who do; it's just I can’t have a drink or use drugs of any kind, because of my addiction.At the age of 16, I became addicted to heavy pain killers. Believe it or not, pills were a completely normal thing to experiment with, at that age, when I was growing up. Kids are being exposed to more and more drugs at an early age now a day. My addiction eventually progressed to the point where i became an IV heroin user. This was the drug that took me all the way down. After years and years of countless rehabs, jails, institutions, putting my family through all sorts of misery, lying, manipulating, and just all around torture, I finally got clean. It wasn't until I hit a very hard rock bottom that I finally made the decision to turn my life around. In early February of 2012, my mother passed away from a heart attack. At the time of her death, I was in jail for things I had done in my active addiction. I can’t even begin to describe the sense of loss, guilt, and hate that I felt, for myself, at this time in life. It's like a light went off in my head that was making me feel like I caused this. Her blood was on my hands; in my eyes. Because of my selfish, manipulative and addictive behavior, I now had to bury my mother. Since her death, I have not touched or taken one drink or used any drugs. This was truly was a blessing in disguise. I believe it was my “wake up call”. She was in much pain due to the fact she had undergone back surgery that left her bed ridden for years prior to her passing. I know, in my heart, she is with God in a much better place.Since becoming clean, I have discovered that I have a beautiful gift. The gift of life. The gift of purpose. The ability to touch souls with my voice. The ability to make a difference. Growing up, the one drug that I could always count on, the one thing that was there for me when no one was, the one thing I could turn to at any time, was music. Music is the best drug!

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>My wife and I began <a href=""http://upbeatnyc.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target="""" title=""UpBeat NYC"">UpBeat NYC</a> in March of 2009 as a musical outreach for inner-city children, youth and adults. Since then, with the enormous help of family, friends, volunteers and partner organizations, we have established programs in Mott Haven, South Bronx and Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. Each program provides year-round music education to community residents <b>completely free of charge</b>. Our participants currently study piano, woodwinds, strings, guitar, percussion and voice.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><span id=""internal-source-marker_0.2612252489197999"" style=""background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline;"">Each program creates an environment that fosters personal achievement, creative self‐expression and group cooperation, empowering individuals by nurturing their unique qualities and strengthening their sense of purpose within the community. </span>UpBeat NYC upholds the belief that every aspect of each student must be nurtured, not just their musical abilities. In communities where the social fabric is weakened by the adversities of poverty, our organization aims to empower individuals to see themselves and their peers in a different light.<br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p></p>
<p>In a city that has nearly eliminated music education from its public schools, generations of families living in impoverished communities have raised children in an environment offering few realistic music education opportunities. For the 41% of Bed-Stuy children and 56% of Mott Haven children living in poverty, access to private instruction is simply unaffordable. Their hopes for music education are left to budget-pinched out-of-school time programs whose efforts leave nearly 14,000 children with no services, music or otherwise.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>UpBeat addresses this need by providing free, year-round music education programming for Bed-Stuy and Mott Haven residents. Beyond music education, our services promote community engagement and offer positive alternatives during the critical after-school hours when risk to youth's health and safety are at a peak. UpBeat NYC currently serves over 50 participants ages 4 and up and is staffed by 15 dedicated volunteers.  </p>

<h3>This is Me and Why I'm Here</h3>
<p>Hello All! My name is Max DeFrancesco and I am running this campaign to study opera for two weeks in Ischia, Italy. Last year I graduated from Montclair State University with a Bachelor of Music in Vocal Performance. Since graduating I have had some success in singing, one being a regular singer of the National Anthem for the New Jersey Devils.</p>
<p>Recently, I have been accepted to the Opera Ischia Program in Italy to continue my training as an aspiring opera singer. However, this acceptance has come through a last minute connection and I am in an unfortunate time crunch for funding before the program begins on July 1st.</p>
<p>Without these contributions, I will not be able to attend this wonderful program to further my vocal studies. Every contribution will be greatly appreciated and immensely helpful in aiding me to reach my goal and achieve my dream.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Crunching the Numbers</h3>
<p>Tuition for the program is $1500 for two weeks and $3000 for four. I am aiming to raise $2300 at minimum for a two week long stay for the First Session of the program. These tuition prices do not include airfare, cost of living or accommodations. Hopefully with enough contributions I will able to attend the program for both sessions.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Program</h3>
<p>The program in Ischia will be two weeks in length and is an opportunity for me to solely focus on my technique and repertoire. The program will give me 4 lessons a week, 6 coachings, and 1 performance. All lessons in the program will be ""open"" as well, thereby giving students a chance to observe hours of lessons each week.</p>
<p>The island of Ischia is very secluded, creating the perfect environment for me to completely devote myself to my singing. My main goal during these two weeks will be to refine my set of arias for auditions in the fall. I plan to audition for Young Artist Residency Programs with Opera Houses in America and possibly Europe.</p>
<p>Contributing to this campaign will give my an extremely productive opportunity to refine my craft to advance me to the next level with my planned auditions in the fall.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Contributions are welcome in any amount, shape or size.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Shielded By Shadows.  Formed in early 2010 as sophomores in high school, we are a 5-piece metal band from Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  Throughout the past year and a half, we have been consistently writing original material.  It has been a long, tedious process of discovering who we are, and as a band, developing our own sound has been a universal goal.</p>
<p>In the summer of 2011 all the hard work finally paid off.  Saving every penny we could, we entered the studio to record our 9-track debut album.  Everything turned out phenomenal.  But the next step, creating physical CDs, is where we are graciously asking for the world's help.</p>
</div><div><p><br/></p></div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The goal is to raise $1500, which will allow us to create top-of-the-line copies of our debut album.  The money donated to us will go directly towards funding for purchasing professional CDs.  Have no fear.  Even if we do not reach our goal, <i>every</i> cent will still go towards the creation of the album.<br/></p>
<p>In addition, anybody who is generous enough to donate $10 or more will have their name specifically printed in the ""Thank You"" section of the album.  Watch with us, as our dream become reality.</p>

there, Lovers. Lauren Eylise here. </p>
<p>For those of you familiar with who I am and what I do, I hope you're happy to hear from me again. For those of you not so familiar, allow me to officially introduce myself: My name is Lauren Eylise and I’m
a singer-songwriter currently based in New York City by way of Cincinnati,
Ohio. </p>
<p>I’ve
been singing for as long as I can remember and my instruments of choice include
an ink pen, acoustic guitar, and piano. I began performing very early in my
life as music has always been a very powerful and important tool for expression
for me, an outlet in which my creativity and passion could flourish without
limit. </p>
<p>In
the midst of performing in Ohio, I released “Unknown Artist” in 2012, a mixtape
of original creations written while I was in college. I formed a band in which
I led as lead vocalist, acoustic guitarist and pianist, playing all original
music alongside original renditions of some of my all-time favorite songs. I
continued to tour in Ohio, appearing at bars, lounges, festivals and a host of
other venues gracing the same stage of some of music’s most talented artists including
Red Wanting Blue, Def Jam’s Rudy Currence, Matt Kearney, and Train.</p>
<p>As
I garnered experience as a performing artist and creative writer, life had
plans of its own to teach me a few other things. I did a lot of writing
in an attempt to not only release but to clarify lessons learned. I found myself knee deep in life
itself, learning the hidden parts of love, heartbreak, and growth. </p>
<p>Enter
“Heartbreak 101”, my upcoming debut album. “Heartbreak 101” is a 9-track
creative project that explores a time in my recent past that was both
simultaneously the darkest and most illuminating part of my life thus far. It
dives into, around and right back within my emotions and lessons learned thus
far. Heartbreak happens to us all in different ways. There is no escaping it.
We experience through loss, gain, detachment. We feel it in our personal and
professional lives. We re-encounter it in memory. It will happen. And the only
thing we can control about it is what we decided to ascertain from the
experience itself. I wrote my way out of great heartbreak into “Heartbreak 101”
and it is my hope that every single ear that hears will be soothed, and if not
healed, brought one step forward to claiming their own experiences and adorning
their battle scars proudly. </p>
<p>Crowd-funding
is perhaps the most fitting means to complete this project. “Heartbreak 101” is
about more than me and my isolated experiences. It’s a story that binds us all
together and quickly reminds that no matter how hard it is to remember in tough
times, we are in fact never alone. Someone has felt that emptiness. Someone has
fought that lump in the throat before the onset of tears. Someone has loved
just as deeply, unafraid, and uninhibited. Someone has felt true, unwavering
joy. </p>
<p>The
idea of co-creating this experience with those who support my music and my
journey truly connects me to this project in an even deeper way and allows me
the opportunity to create authentically without worrying about anything but the
music that will touch us all in different way. I need YOU to make this project
happen and I am very excited to share OUR story with the rest of the world. </p>
<p>This
crowd-funding campaign will run for about 60 days, during which time I'll be doing a few small live shows in New York City, planning photo shoots and a host of other pre-production activities. Following, I’ll be heading
directly to Chicago, IL to complete recording. I also plan to record at least 3 music videos for the creative
project. I am very passionate about the power of this project and I refuse to
sell any aspect of its creation short. </p>
<p>I’m
a very passionate, innovative, and visionary artist ready to bring an element
of authenticity that’s lacking in today’s music back to the scene. There are a TON of things to offer in return for your support – so please READ ON for
additional perks, giveaways and more! </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3><p>We need $5,000 for production, travel, and other miscellaneous expenses (i.e. food, video production, etc.) to complete the Heartbreak 101 creative project. </p><p>In exchange for your monetary contribution, there are a few unique perks!

</div></div>","Crossroads is pleased to announce our 4th trip to the playa!
What does it take to have a 15+ piece band perform in the challenging conditions of Black Rock City for three hours a night, four days in a row? In short, you need: months of planning and rehearsing, a camp of 150 professional artists, builders, performers, dancers, organizers, and support crew, plus the blood, sweat, and tears of devoted Crossroadians weeks before and after The Event. The Crossroads camp, for the fourth year, is happy to give all of this and more to the Black Rock City community. You know what else it takes? Thousands upon thousands of dollars to pay for sound equipment rentals, light rentals, transportation costs, storage costs, building material costs, cleaning of said equipment, etc. The sad fact is that the cost to produce The Crossroads has grown to be more than our camp fees can cover. The good news is that with your help and the help of the Black Rock community, we can again bring live soul, funk, and pop music out to the Playa for 2014.For those who don’t know us, we’re a truly unique presence on the playa; we perform nightly live shows with our band of ultra-talented artists, musicians and performers. We bring magic to the playa through the sounds of funk, soul, hip hop, R&B, jazz, rock, and everything in between with a full orchestra of talented musicians, vocalists, dancers and amazing burlesque performances.But this isn't just any fun group of individuals getting together. The band is comprised of working professionals- musicians and singers, most of whom tour and record with major acts worldwide. If you're looking for a professional show delivered by seasoned pros- in the desert, then look no further! Don't be surprised when you're on your way to deep playa to see the latest fad DJ, yet somehow find yourself stuck at our camp every night instead... We see it happen!For those who know us, you know how epic things can get when our shows kick it into high gear.  Every year we pour our hearts, soul, and blood into our shows.  Each year we are taxed to the max.  We have the bulk of what we need already but this year we are asking for your help.  We don’t’ want anyone to be left holding the bag. What We Need & What You GetYour contributions will go to offsetting the cost our camp and show production. Donations will help fund sound and equipment rentals, building materials for the live stage, our always-friendly neighborhood bar, gas and transportation!This year, our nightly shows will also include a post party with mixed-genre DJ sets to keep the party going well into the night. We’re aiming to be a true social center on the playa, and that’s why we need your help!  You aren’t just getting a show you are becoming part of the joy and camaraderie that is created on the playa.  The more we raise the better the gift we can give back to YOU!Our unique artists, musicians and performers are some of the most talented and dedicated you will ever meet.  We give back in blood sweat and funky beats.  Come by for some cool drinks and hot beats!  Help us bring our LIVE funk back to the playa! PerksTake home a piece of Crossroads!    We have some seriously talented musicians!  Use the links to have a listen and check out some of what our guys do all year round!  Pick one, two or take the whole list home!!  Your ears won't be disappointed!JAdam Theis - Jazz Mafia's ""Brass, Bows & Beats""

 you may already know, our beloved Keynote Cafe has reopened in a new 
location just a few blocks from the the old location. The new space is 
larger than the old, with new amenities, including a large room behind 
the stage for bands to store equipment. The owner, Jill Sorrels, has 
worked very hard to renovate the space in order to give musicians a 
place to play and young people a safe place to experience live music. I 
personally can't thank her enough for her contributions to local music 
and arts. </p><p>Jill has given us so much and I feel it's time for us 
to give back. As mentioned, the new space is much larger than the old. 
This is great because more people can attend concerts, open mics, and 
art showings. The downside is that the PA system owned by the venue is 
no longer enough for the larger space. Within a few months, constantly

 you may already know, our beloved Keynote Cafe has reopened in a new 
location just a few blocks from the the old location. The new space is 
larger than the old, with new amenities, including a large room behind 
the stage for bands to store equipment. The owner, Jill Sorrels, has 
worked very hard to renovate the space in order to give musicians a 
place to play and young people a safe place to experience live music. I 
personally can't thank her enough for her contributions to local music 
and arts. Jill has given us so much and I feel it's time for us 
to give back. As mentioned, the new space is much larger than the old. 
This is great because more people can attend concerts, open mics, and 
art showings. The downside is that the PA system owned by the venue is 
no longer enough for the larger space. Within a few months, constantly 
being pushed to (and often beyond) its limits, I fear their equipment 
will cease to work. In order to combat this, I would like to raise money
 for a sound system for the new venue. The real deal. Bands can

<p>My name is Zeev Nitzan Ginsburg, and I'm a musician. <br/> I was born in Israel, and then grew up in India for 15 years. I'm now living in LA, attending college, and trying to kick start my Music career. <br/> I've been playing music for several years, and have already contributed to several recordings, to bands in LA, India and Israel. I've played onstage with some of India's finest musicians, such as Elvis Lobo, Shane Ballantyne, Joe Ferrao and Carlos Gonsalves. (YouTube them, definitely worth it.)<br/><br/> I'm now working on my first solo record, and need a good guitar to record with. I've acquired a 1984 Fender Stratocaster, used. She's an amazing guitar, but sadly was not maintained very well, and needs a lot of work, everything from a new bridge to pickups and tone knobs. <br/> I've wanted to make my own music project ever since I started playing guitar, and I've written a lot of music for this album.  <br/> I have time in a friends studio booked for October, so I need to get it done by then. It would be hugely sad if my dream fell to pieces because of this.<br/><br/> What can YOU do to help make this a reality? <br/> Contribute. Every little bit counts, and the more you can contribute, the closer I get. This project means the world to me, and you, the people, will be making my greatest dream come true! </p>
<p><strong>What your funds will be doing. </strong></p>
<p>I'm asking for 1,600$. With that, I can overhaul my guitar sufficiently for recording. <br/> About 550$ will go towards new Pickups. For those who don't know what those are, think of it as the guitars microphones. They are magnets, under the strings that transfer the string's vibrations into the sound you hear over an amplifier. For those who DO know what they are, I'm going to get Seymour Duncans, hopefully Zephyr Silver Wired.<br/> 200$ will be for custom electronics and wiring, a kill switch, coilsplitting, etc. <br/> Another 550$ is for a Floyd Rose bridge and installation, plus related labor costs. <br/> The last 300$, is for a new paintjob, new pickguard, and other miscellaneous expenses incurred. <br/><br/>Every little bit counts. $1, $2, whatever it is you can spare.

<p><strong>WHO are EmZ and Sir Stephen? </strong></p>
<p><strong>STEPHEN DOWNS – a.k.a Sir Stephen</strong> – began his stage career at the age of eight From there he worked steadily in and around his home county of Surrey, England, as a singer, impressionist and ventriloquist. At the age of 12, he landed a role in the West End production of Damn Yankees, the first of many appearances in London's West End.</p>
<p>At age 15, Stephen signed with <strong>HMV/EMI</strong> and began a recording career that was to last for over a decade, with a top ten single, and culminating in appearing with the <strong>Beatles</strong> at the height of Beatlemania. Stephen also did extensive touring of England, Ireland, Scotland and Europe; and worked with rock and pop stars such <strong>Alice Cooper</strong>, <strong>Mickey Dolenz</strong> of the <strong>Monkees</strong>, <strong>Brenda Lee</strong>, G<strong>erry &amp; the Pacemakers</strong>, <strong>Harry Nilson</strong>, <strong>Donovan</strong>, and others.</p>
<p>At age 17, Stephen became <strong>Mel Tormé’s</strong> protégé, an achievement he rates as one of the highest moments in his career; he was also the youngest performer ever to headline at London's legendary Astor Club. </p>
<p>In 1965, <strong>Merv Griffin</strong> signed Stephen and brought him to New York as a regular on his show. Sir Stephen’s music career has encompassed almost every facet of the entertainment business. He toured with legendary rock stars, wrote and produced two record albums, including a cast album of his Broadway musical, Festival.

We're bringing sexy back....
EmZ is an international woman of mystery. Born in the lush tropical heat of Northern Australia her youth was spent frolicking in the untamed wilderness underneath the warm glow of the sun. Always listening to the songs within, EmZ draws her artistic inspiration from the landscape she grew up in and from the rich life experiences she has collected on her travels across continents. 
In the past year EmZ has been hard at work writing and recording her collection of songs in collaboration with the celebrated musical genius of Sir Stephen. We need your help to complete the big sexy album ""EZ Does It"" in time for EmZ's New York debut at the legendary ""Don't Tell Mama"" in the heart Broadway.
EmZ has contributed every spare penny to record these sweet and vicious tunes but there is still a lot to do and little time to complete her vision. Now with this fabulous opportunity to showcase her talents at this wonderful venue that has launched many an artists career including Nancy LaMott and has featured in numerous TV Shows from “Friends” to “Saturday Night Live”, we need YOU!


EmZ is looking for $5,000 to complete this exciting and unique musical project that encompasses many different artistic facets.
Your financial contributions will allow EmZ to:
- Complete the recording of the album (mixing, mastering, paying musicians, getting the CD pressed) 
- Making music videos (paying editors, Director of Photography)
- Marketing costs to promote the CD and the show  
AND IT DOESN""T STOP THERE!
Ever the artist EmZ is looking to hand print and lovingly make the CD packaging in time to be on sale at ""Don't Tell Mama"". These costs include ink, paper, and time!!
All funds will go towards the completion of this project whether we reach the goal or not!
The Album ""EZ Does IT"" is going to bring a lot of beauty into this world.  


The collaboration between Sir Stephen and EmZ has resulted in some truly unique, heartfelt songs. This is a new sound that the world has never heard before! With Sir Stephen's life experience and wealth of musical experience combined with EmZ's honest and poetic lyrics these songs cross multiple genres and appeals to all ages. 


WHO are EmZ and Sir Stephen? 
STEPHEN DOWNS – a.k.a Sir Stephen – began his stage career at the age of eight From there he worked steadily in and around his home county of Surrey, England, as a singer, impressionist and ventriloquist. At the age of 12, he landed a role in the West End production of Damn Yankees, the first of many appearances in London's West End.
At age 15, Stephen signed with HMV/EMI and began a recording career that was to last for over a decade, with a top ten single, and culminating in appearing with the Beatles at the height of Beatlemania. Stephen also did extensive touring of England, Ireland, Scotland and Europe; and worked with rock and pop stars such Alice Cooper, Mickey Dolenz of the Monkees, Brenda Lee, Gerry & the Pacemakers, Harry Nilson, Donovan, and others.
At age 17, Stephen became Mel Tormé’s protégé, an achievement he rates as one of the highest moments in his career; he was also the youngest performer ever to headline at London's legendary Astor Club. 
In 1965, Merv Griffin signed Stephen and brought him to New York as a regular on his show. Sir Stephen’s music career has encompassed almost every facet of the entertainment business. He toured with legendary rock stars, wrote and produced two record albums, including a cast album of his Broadway musical, Festival. Along with his wife, Lady T, he is co-producing a CD of Ghosts of the Titanic, a mystical, musical journey. Sir Stephen considers working with EmZ one of the most musically rewarding and creative experiences of his career.

I am an aspiring musician who loves writing, producing, and performing. I am a 21-year-old student at Bard College, studying, you guessed it, music! As of now, I have already released one single and one EP on sites like SoundCloud and BandCamp, but I feel as though it is time to take my music to the next step and give it some more attention to reach a broader audience. So, I will be creating a 9-song album and releasing it in the spring of 2015. This album will include 7 brand new tracks and two instrumentals. Some additional remixes to songs may also be released. It will be self-written and self-produced. </p>

<br/> </div> <div> <h3>What's Needed &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>Like kickstarting a business, recording an album and treating it both as a work of art and as a sellable product require investors. What is still needed to achieve the most professional-sounding recording is gear for a recording studio, hiring sound engineers and producers, and publicizing and distributing the finished product. Without the proper funds, this album will sound very amateurish and will not achieve recognition due to lack of publicity. </p>
<p>Aside from recording the actual album, the majority of the funds will be spent on engineering, promoting, and distributing the album. A professional recorded album is not finalized until it has a precise, refined sound. The job of the producer will be to work with these recordings and give them the proper sound features.  The sound engineer will take these recordings and master them into the finalized product. Next comes packaging; no album is complete without professional-looking physical copies and digital downloads. Both formats will require original and creative album artwork. For that, I will contact professional photographers and graphic designers. Finally comes PR and distribution. By this, we're talking about getting radio airplay, getting featured in blogs and magazines that spotlight new artists, and appearing on online music sites such as iTunes, Spotify, Pandora, Google Play, Amazon MP3, etc. To achieve this, I will need to contact and work closely with a publicist and distribution team, which will not be cheap, but is a necessary investment for giving this album exposure. </p>
<p>Distribution and PR does not seal the deal, though. Once an album is out, it is very important that I do all I can to promote the release myself. The best way to do this is by playing shows. In addition to my love for recording, I also love performing and being on stage, and I really hope to spend the summer of 2015 going to as many venues as possible and sharing this album in a live setting with future listeners. This will require costs for transportation. </p>
<p>Now you might be thinking, that's cool and all, but what's in it for me? Why should I donate? Well, in addition to being part of a fun music experience, there are gifts involved! If you check the perks, you will see that any donation you make will get you a prize. Prizes include personalized and privatized concerts, issued hard copies of the album before it is released, your name featured on the album as a contributor, and more!</p>

<br/> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Music heals and saves people. It has done so for me many times. In September, when this album was just an idea in the back of my head, I suffered a very serious injury of my left foot. I broke six bones and had to get an extensive surgery. Without the surgery, I would not have a functioning foot, and therefore would never walk, let alone perform properly again. Even as this campaign is launching, I am still in the healing process. This foot fiasco brought about frustration, anger, depression, anxiety, and fear. But there was one thing that was able to lift me out of this dark mental state: MUSIC! Whenever I was at my worst physically or mentally, music was a way for me to escape and readjust my mood. Not only did I listen to music in my time of healing, but I also wrote a lot of new music, too, and what you will hear on the album are some of my latest creations. </p>
<p>Although this injury was devastating, it taught me to live every day to the fullest and not be afraid to step out of my comfort zone and constantly strive to reach new heights. I now wake up every day ready to explore, learn, and create, and I do that through new music. In addition to providing a great listening experience with this album, I want people to be able to come together through the music and bring to the table whatever they are feeling, whether it be happiness or anger, and use the music to express themselves, or use the music to release any negative emotions. This album has something there for everyone, and I hope that people will connect with it and use it to dance, laugh, cry, heal, party, chill, sleep, whatever.</p>

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Recording an album is no easy task. In addition to spending a lot of time writing and deciding how the songs should sound, I need to take into account how to make these songs the best they can be. The only way to do that is to plan each step accordingly and dedicate time to recording and producing every day. There are some actions that are currently beyond my skill level, such as intricate audio engineering, that are still a necessity for finalizing a solid piece of recorded music. That is where I turn to others to help me in this process. Once the recording is finished, it needs to be packaged and distributed, That entails an additional risk because finding a proper distributing service is a tricky and time consuming yet essential task for reaching as many people as possible. The final challenge is planning a tour and finding some local venues to showcase my songs. It can all be done! It just requires a lot of time, attention, and planning. </p>

<p></p>
<p><i>We see ways to improve music accessories, so we reinvent.  We see ways to impact the world, so we reinvest.  Hogjim (хөгжим) is the Mongolian word for music, and through music we plan to transform Mongolia.  Today half of Hogjim's profits go directly to the people of Mongolia.  </i></p>

<h1><b>The Pik-Tik</b></h1>
<p></p>
<p>If you're a guitarist or have ever seen one with a pick in their mouth, you know that there is no place to hold your pick while playing.  With the Pik-Tik you can cut your transitioning time to tenths of a second and become a better guitarist.  This entirely new idea allows a guitarist to shift between strumming and finger picking seamlessly.</p>
<p>The Pik-Tik (patent pending) is a pick holder that suctions anywhere on your pick guard, keeping your pick perpendicular to the guitar's surface.  The entry slot is slightly curved, providing an excellent grabbing function for any light to medium pick.  Whether you insert the pick one millimeter or the full five millimeters, the Pik-Tik will still grasp your pick. The Pik-Tik can be easily removed after you're done playing or can be left on your guitar as a pick holder; either way it will not damage the surface. </p>

<h1>The Guitar Picks</h1>
<p>Although the Pik-Tik will work with any brand of light or medium picks, we have made custom Hogjim ""H"" picks that are the perfect thickness for your Pik-Tik.  Our picks are light/mediums, around .71 mm.  </p>

<h1>The Guitar Strap</h1>
<p>As a guitarist myself, I was frustrated by guitar straps that were too hard to put on or would fall off while playing. Fixing one issue seemed to sacrifice the other. Strap locks are expensive and only work if you can replace the pegs that screw into the guitar, which is impossible for acoustic guitars with electronic pickups.  </p>
<p>Hogjim's guitar strap is both secure and quick to attach.  Your guitar peg clips though the silicone tabs then pulls down the key hole shaped strap ends. </p>

<h1>The Story</h1>
<h1></h1>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">
</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Hogjim: Music Imports has truly been a global adventure. A
journey that began in the overpopulated streets of Hong Kong, found purpose in
Mongolia and came to life in Wyoming. <br/><br/><span>The idea for the pik-tik originated in early
2012 when I was working at an international church in Hong Kong, China. As
a music director myself, I was frustrated by not having place to put my pick
between finger picking and strumming. After searching the guitar accessory
market for a solution, I decided to develop my own. I handed the clay
prototype off to a friend who worked in the manufacturing industry just before
leaving for three months to work for a NGO (Non-Governmental Organization) in
Mongolia. <br/><br/>
Working for an NGO in a foreign country left little time to develop a company,
but did open my eyes to overwhelming poverty. In Mongolia’s capital of
Ulaanbaatar (UB), most people live on less than $3 a day, unemployment is north
of 50%, and alcoholism is about 80% among men. Nearly half of the country’s
three million people live in UB and around 70% of those people live in what is
called the ger district. The ger district is defined by a lack of running water,
sanitation, and paved roads. Frequently dropping to negative 45 degrees
Fahrenheit, Mongolia is home to one of the world’s harshest climates. The
combination of these hardships leave the Mongolian people forced to suffer and
merely endure life. During three months living in the ger district of UB, I
witnessed more hunger, death, and hopelessness than ever before. Leaving was
disheartening, for the country had captured my heart, but I knew that I’d be
back. <br/><br/>
My transition from one of the world’s poorest countries to one of the
wealthiest challenged me to combine a love for music and my heart for Mongolia.
In the months following, my clay prototype transformed into a working pik-tik,
and Hogjim LLC was formed in Laramie, Wyoming. There I was then encouraged to
develop a company, rather than just a product. A guitar strap was next added to
the accessory line; it clips on quicker and doesn’t fall off while playing. As
ideas for products developed so did the vision for the company. </span></span></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Wonderland Syndrome and we need your money! We have had to turn down several major European tour offers (most recently a 42 date tour with Marduk &amp; Immolation) this year due to the fact that like most musicians, we are flat broke. As luck would have it, we have now been offered a smaller tour, closer to home, that is within our reach. ENDRAH, the most dangerous band in Brazil, is headlining their first US tour and they've invited us to come along. Long story short, we're fucking stoked!</p>
<p>Like all hard working, honest musicians, it's not about the money. All we want is to share our music with people who will (hopefully) appreciate and enjoy it.  We are hoping to break even financially on this tour, but not necessarily expecting to. If all goes well we will make enough from this tour to fund other, bigger tours.</p>
<p>This tour is a big opportunity for our band. Thank you all (in advance) for helping us bring our madness to a whole new group of Space Pirates!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><br/>Our goal of $1500 is to help us pay for booking fees, promotions, merchandise, guitar and bass strings, drum sticks, ramen noodles, and the biggest expense, GAS! We will be sleeping in our jeep and eating ramen (unless we can find something even cheaper!) Being the broke fuckers that we are, we don't have much to offer you in return to your help, but hopefully you'll see something here that'll catch your eye!</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>All you Space Pirates out there are the ones that are going to make this happen! This tour is going to pave the way for many to come. If this tour isn't hitting your city, the next one will. Or the next one after that (hopefully). Wonderland Syndrome is going to share our ridiculousness with the world! We fucking love you guys and can't wait to rock the fuck out with each and every one of you!</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you're broke like us, don't get depressed! Share this shit with your friends on Facebook, Twitter, Myspace (just kidding lolol), and whatever other social networks we all waste our lives away on!!</p>

The group's signature sound pleases both crowds and critics, blending jazz classics, hard bop, west coast cool and favorite selections from the DMG's 10 critically-acclaimed CDs. 
“Their music is a fertile landscape without boundaries,” writes the Oakland Tribune, “earning Matheny and his cohorts a reputation as one of the most eclectic and daring ensembles on today’s jazz scene.”All About Jazz agrees: “An all-star jazz band, the Dmitri Matheny Group is a cohesive and seamless unit, serving up equal parts soulful expression, caressing phrases, imaginative asides, and dedicated lyricism.”

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Since forming in 2007, Moneta has been dedicated to making high quality music. 3 EP's and 1 full-length album later, we've decided that it's time for us to take it to the next level--both creatively and with production. This time, we've teamed up with renowned producer Jim Wirt (Incubus, Hoobastank, Jack's Mannequin) and will be tracking at the legendary Robert Lang Studios (Nirvana, Deathcab For Cutie, Taking Back Sunday) in Seattle starting late May 2013. We are so excited--not only about the prospect of creating a timeless record for our fans--but also for an experience we will cherish for the rest of our lives.</p>
<div>
<h3><strong>How You Can Make A Difference</strong></h3>
<p>Moneta has always been a hard-working band that has funded all of our previous records with money from shows and out of our own pockets. We have committed to funding as much of this record as possible within all of our means, but this time we are recording at a higher level studio with an acclaimed producer--we are asking for your help to meet us in the middle of the higher cost. All of your contributions will go towards recording, mixing, mastering, and duplication costs, as well as covering the cool perks we have planned. If we happen to exceed our campaign goal, the extra money will go towards the filming of a high quality music video. Thank you all for helping us in achieving this goal!</p>
<h3><strong>The Breakdown</strong></h3>

<p>Hi there!  My name is Glen Sprigg, and I am the organist at my local Catholic church.  For years I have been playing my own music at mass, and have received many compliments on my songs.  I deeply believe in my faith, and I see my musical talent as a gift from God to bring people closer to Him and His church.  I want to get my music out beyond my own church, to the greater Christian community.  So I'm going to record my music, send copies to publishers in the USA, and trust the rest to God.  God provides the inspiration, not the funding.  That's where you come in.</p>
<p><br/>I've received a quote from a local recording studio, as well as a price for making the CDs themselves.  The total is $2500, which isn't much, but when you're a single-income family with three boys, it's tough to scrape the money together.  $500 is for the recording sessions themselves, both my own musical contribution as well as the soloists and the choir.  $700 is for mastering the tracks to a professional quality, and the remainder will go to physically producing the CDs themselves.</p>
<p>So what am I offering in return?  Well, since this is all about music, I'm going to offer copies of the music itself.  The basic perk is an mp3 and the sheet music for my first and most popular song, the Christmas song, 'Seek the Child.'  I'm also offering the sheet music for all my music in PDF or even in print, complete with autograph, for higher rewards.</p>
Most Christian music is written from a different, non-Catholic perspective; my goal is simple: add a new perspective for people who are searching for meaning and truth in their lives. This is my first musical project, and I need your help to make it a reality. If you aren't able to help me financially, please help by getting the word out.

<br/><h1>How much will it cost?</h1>
<p>There are ""perks"" to donating $10 or more. If you donate $10 you get MusicEmbryo's new album. If you donate $20 you get both MusicEmbryo albums. The bigger the donation, the better the perk! <br/></p>
<h4>Studio Time</h4>
<p>Because this is a top of the line studio, <span class=""notranlsate""><span class=""notranlsate"">for an independent artist to rent, </span></span>it cost $75 per hour, or $750 per 12hr-block. However, Joel is being given a rare discount, because he is producing the album as an employee of the Institute.</p>
<h4>Discount</h4>
<p>The most affordable way to rent this studio is by 12hr-blocks. With that, Joel is getting a $250 discount off of each 12hr-block. Plus, he is saving me even more money by not charging me for engineering the recording. We have been preparing and organizing this recording to be as efficient as possible. Three 12hr-blocks are estimated for what it will take to record four songs, mix them, and finish them. Joel is saving us $750, plus the engineer labor. Bringing us to a total of $1,500. <br/></p>
<h4>Physical Copies</h4>
<p>It would be great to have physical copies of the record to distribute, unlike the first MusicEmbryo record. The number one manufacturer for independent artists is Disc Makers. They create one CD of your album for $1... if you buy one thousand of them. If you buy five hundred of them, they create one CD for $1.80. <br/></p>
<ul>
<li>1,000 CDs for $999 (including printed jacket and disc)<br/>
</li>
<li>500 CDs for $899 (including printed jacket and disc)<br/>

<p>Vinyl records would be way more interesting, but it is more expensive. So it depends on how much we have to work with. So far, it will cost approximately $2500 to record this album in a professional studio with 1000 CDs to give out.</p>

<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>As four new incoming graduate students at the Eastman School of Music in the fall of 2015, we decided to form a quartet. During our first year together as a group, we found that we really enjoyed performing together and started performing around Rochester as much as possible. Our first concert at the National Museum of Play in Rochester helped us learn that we loved playing for all types of audiences in many different kinds of venues, and we have continued that trend ever since. In our second year with a lot of hard work and a little luck, we found success on the competition circuit, namely being awarded the Gold Medal at the 44th Annual Fischoff Chamber Music Competition and the 8th Plowman National Chamber Music Competition, two of the largest competitions of their types in the United States.</p>
<p>We have thoroughly enjoyed the past few years sharing our music with you through our recitals and community concerts. One question that consistently came up amongst our listeners was, “Do you have an album?” Now as we get ready to record our debut album, we need your help! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">After our success in the national competition circuit, three members of our group graduated from Eastman and are now scattered through the United States pursuing further graduate studies at institutions in Illinois and Georgia. While we still perform together, we wanted to have something that allows our listeners to hear us whenever they want! We decided that an album would be an exciting new endeavor for our group to pursue!</span></p>
<p>While in the very beginning stages of planning this campaign, we were contacted by Parma Recordings, who coincidentally saw our Fischoff performance on YouTube. They reached out to us expressing their interest in supporting a recording project by our group.</p>
<p>We then spent a few months deliberating what we wanted on our album. The more we discussed this, the clearer it became that we wanted to record two pieces that we believe helped shape our group identity, and we also wanted to record a piece that was recently written for our group!</p>
<p><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>The first piece we decided on was David Maslanka's <i>Recitation Book</i>. Our group cherishes this piece because it was the very first one we learned and performed together! We love how Maslanka reworks selected chorales of J.S. Bach and turns them into something that sounds familiar, yet new. This is perhaps our most frequently performed work, as we have performed it all throughout the United States at various venues including the Susan B. Anthony House in Rochester, the Chicago Cultural Center, and on radio on 98.7WFMT. Our group has spent countless hours rehearing this piece, and we love that we discover new things about it every time we perform it. We also knew this piece had to be included on the album because David Maslanka recently passed away, which we found has changed the way we think about and perform this work.</span></p>
<p>The second work we chose for this album was William Albright's <i>Fantasy Etudes</i>. This piece was also on our competition program, and we love how eccentric and eclectic this work is. This is also one of our favorite works to perform because it allows us to explore the extremes of the saxophone.We believe this theatric and whimsical work perfectly captures who we are as a group. Often considered one of the more difficult works of saxophone quartet music, we found that this piece taught us the value of group communication in chamber music. </p>
<p>The last piece we chose is the one we are perhaps most excited to share with you all! We love performing and promoting the works of the talented composers of today, and we wanted this piece to be from a fellow Eastman colleague because of our admiration for the school and the talented musicians and composers that go there. Our soprano player, Nicki, performed one of David Clay Mettens' first works for saxophones, <i>Everything that rises</i>, on her first DMA recital. We all met with Clay after the performance over drinks, and the beginning of our friendship would soon spark a fruitful collaboration. The result, <i>Ornithology S</i>, is Clay's first work for the saxophone quartet, and our very first commission as a group! We recently premiered this work at the 2018 North American Saxophone Alliance conference in Cincinnati, and we received so much support from our saxophone colleagues surrounding the piece! Just as our group is beginning this new stage of our professional career, this piece is the new landmark that represents this transition. We are so thrilled to be recording what we think is an exceptional new work for saxophone quartet by and incredibly talented composer!</p>
<p>We are looking forward to this album being an important milestone for our group. We are so excited to share with you these three pieces that mean so much to us. Our biggest goal for this album is to capture the same excitement and passion that we have while performing live. We not only love performing these three pieces, but we feel that each piece has a special meaning for us.</p>
<p>A special thank you to Parma Recordings!<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1522196060/jemv3bqgstja5mb8osgd.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3><strong>Why We Need Your Support?</strong></h3>
<p>Having played together for almost 3 years now, we love making music and love sharing it even more. We have spent many hours discussing how to put together an album that is not only a culmination of all the work we have put into the group, but also a representation of who we are as a group. That means that we want to our end product to not only be of the highest quality, but also a milestone in the history of our group. And with that goal in mind comes a very expensive process, including everything from the cost of commissioning of <i>Ornithology S</i>, to the cost of publishing, distribution and promotion fees for the album. Every single donation, no matter how big or how small, will play a part in the success of this project, and every contribution is incredibly appreciated. Additionally, any amount raised over our goal will go towards future recording projects. Below is a visualization of what the money we raise will cover:</p>

As four new incoming graduate students at the Eastman School of Music in the fall of 2015, we decided to form a quartet. During our first year together as a group, we found that we really enjoyed performing together and started performing around Rochester as much as possible. Our first concert at the National Museum of Play in Rochester helped us learn that we loved playing for all types of audiences in many different kinds of venues, and we have continued that trend ever since. In our second year with a lot of hard work and a little luck, we found success on the competition circuit, namely being awarded the Gold Medal at the 44th Annual Fischoff Chamber Music Competition and the 8th Plowman National Chamber Music Competition, two of the largest competitions of their types in the United States.
We have thoroughly enjoyed the past few years sharing our music with you through our recitals and community concerts. One question that consistently came up amongst our listeners was, “Do you have an album?” Now as we get ready to record our debut album, we need your help! 

The Project
After our success in the national competition circuit, three members of our group graduated from Eastman and are now scattered through the United States pursuing further graduate studies at institutions in Illinois and Georgia. While we still perform together, we wanted to have something that allows our listeners to hear us whenever they want! We decided that an album would be an exciting new endeavor for our group to pursue!
While in the very beginning stages of planning this campaign, we were contacted by Parma Recordings, who coincidentally saw our Fischoff performance on YouTube. They reached out to us expressing their interest in supporting a recording project by our group.
We then spent a few months deliberating what we wanted on our album. The more we discussed this, the clearer it became that we wanted to record two pieces that we believe helped shape our group identity, and we also wanted to record a piece that was recently written for our group!
The first piece we decided on was David Maslanka's Recitation Book. Our group cherishes this piece because it was the very first one we learned and performed together! We love how Maslanka reworks selected chorales of J.S. Bach and turns them into something that sounds familiar, yet new. This is perhaps our most frequently performed work, as we have performed it all throughout the United States at various venues including the Susan B. Anthony House in Rochester, the Chicago Cultural Center, and on radio on 98.7WFMT. Our group has spent countless hours rehearing this piece, and we love that we discover new things about it every time we perform it. We also knew this piece had to be included on the album because David Maslanka recently passed away, which we found has changed the way we think about and perform this work.
The second work we chose for this album was William Albright's Fantasy Etudes. This piece was also on our competition program, and we love how eccentric and eclectic this work is. This is also one of our favorite works to perform because it allows us to explore the extremes of the saxophone.We believe this theatric and whimsical work perfectly captures who we are as a group. Often considered one of the more difficult works of saxophone quartet music, we found that this piece taught us the value of group communication in chamber music. 
The last piece we chose is the one we are perhaps most excited to share with you all! We love performing and promoting the works of the talented composers of today, and we wanted this piece to be from a fellow Eastman colleague because of our admiration for the school and the talented musicians and composers that go there. Our soprano player, Nicki, performed one of David Clay Mettens' first works for saxophones, Everything that rises, on her first DMA recital. We all met with Clay after the performance over drinks, and the beginning of our friendship would soon spark a fruitful collaboration. The result, Ornithology S, is Clay's first work for the saxophone quartet, and our very first commission as a group! We recently premiered this work at the 2018 North American Saxophone Alliance conference in Cincinnati, and we received so much support from our saxophone colleagues surrounding the piece! Just as our group is beginning this new stage of our professional career, this piece is the new landmark that represents this transition. We are so thrilled to be recording what we think is an exceptional new work for saxophone quartet by and incredibly talented composer!
We are looking forward to this album being an important milestone for our group. We are so excited to share with you these three pieces that mean so much to us. Our biggest goal for this album is to capture the same excitement and passion that we have while performing live. We not only love performing these three pieces, but we feel that each piece has a special meaning for us.
A special thank you to Parma Recordings!
Why We Need Your Support?
Having played together for almost 3 years now, we love making music and love sharing it even more. We have spent many hours discussing how to put together an album that is not only a culmination of all the work we have put into the group, but also a representation of who we are as a group. That means that we want to our end product to not only be of the highest quality, but also a milestone in the history of our group. And with that goal in mind comes a very expensive process, including everything from the cost of commissioning of Ornithology S, to the cost of publishing, distribution and promotion fees for the album. Every single donation, no matter how big or how small, will play a part in the success of this project, and every contribution is incredibly appreciated. Additionally, any amount raised over our goal will go towards future recording projects. Below is a visualization of what the money we raise will cover:

<p>Hi there! My name is Deirdre Forrest. I'm a singer and songwriter from Asbury Park, NJ. I've been performing throughout the tristate area since 2009. I've shared the stage with amazing acts, played countless shows to fantastic crowds and shared my heart and soul with so many wonderful people. Singing is my reason for being.

My new EP Fear[Less] is a departure from the stripped-down acoustic vibe of my past projects. I'm so proud of the work that has been done, but there is still more to do.</p>

</h2><p> </p><p><strong>Growing up, I (Randall) accepted these type of negative suggestions from my environment, and it led me to a path of turmoil, substance abuse, violence, and aggression in my teens, and the music I listened to reinforced that identity. One night, I was fortunate to hear a song that told me a different story--that I was much more than what I had been living, that I had a purpose and was worthy to live a better life. It broke me down and forced me to face the shadows within. I listened to that song over and over and over, allowing it to repeat all night while I slept. When I awoke the next morning, my trajectory had completely changed. And then my life followed. It was then that I began to realize the awesome power of music, and I wanted to be a part of that.

“The highest goal of music is to connect one’s soul to their Divine Nature, not entertainment.”
~Pythagoras (569- 475 BC)
 
Hi, we are Randall and Kristin Brooks of Bhakti House Band, and we want to invite YOU to join us in something life-altering… world-changing… revolutionary…
 Sunrise 108 Gayatri Meditation workshop, Fort Lauderdale, FL Music Has the Power to Heal & Change the World We believe that music and sacred sound have the power to change and heal the world. And our mission is to share positive, uplifting, healing music that inspires us all to rise above the mundane and joyfully live life to the fullest. Our desire is to create a soundtrack for living a life filled with purpose and passion, and then set the world on fire with love. Our music, filled with love and mantra (Sanskrit for ""protective tool for the mind""), sends out positive vibes to work on us at the most subtle levels--especially in calming the sympathetic nervous system, as well as sends a positive message to reprogram our thought and emotional patterns. We all live in a society that tells us that love and kindness are not the norms. We are surrounded by programming from the media, news, politicians, and advertisers all telling us that we are broken in some way. They insist that the world is full of nothing but evil and hate at every turn, that we are doomed, and only they can save us. If we accept these suggestions as truth, then our reality will follow.  But... we are here to challenge all of that.    Great teachers of the past tell us that ""suggestion"" is the most powerful force in the universe… that life itself was born through the power of suggestion. 100% of our human behavior is a direct result of suggestion, whether that suggestion comes from ourselves or from our environment. What you feed grows, and what you feed yourself is what you become. This is especially true regarding music since music has been proven to be one of the fastest and most powerful ways to instill new suggestions or change thought patterns. That's where we come in...  
A little background...
 Growing up, I (Randall) accepted these type of negative suggestions from my environment, and it led me to a path of turmoil, substance abuse, violence, and aggression in my teens, and the music I listened to reinforced that identity. One night, I was fortunate to hear a song that told me a different story--that I was much more than what I had been living, that I had a purpose and was worthy to live a better life. It broke me down and forced me to face the shadows within. I listened to that song over and over and over, allowing it to repeat all night while I slept. When I awoke the next morning, my trajectory had completely changed. And then my life followed. It was then that I began to realize the awesome power of music, and I wanted to be a part of that. It soon became my desire to write songs and share music that was inspiring and thought-provoking—songs to challenge dogma and invite others to stop and think for themselves a little more.   Boy Meets Girl    +     =     Soon after, this boy from the hood met a girl from the west side (Kristin) who grew up surrounded by all types of music from classical to the Beatles, playing piano, writing music, singing in musical theatre productions and choirs as well as various  local bands, and who had even been a music major in college. Though from very different worlds, our voices and our hearts came together so effortlessly, and she shared my passion to share inspiring (and maybe a little controversial) music. So here we are now. We've been singing together for almost 25 years and married just about as long. Completely devoted to one another as well as to our dharma (life purpose) and musical mission to spread healing love through song, we have shared our music as Bhakti House Band  (which means the House of Love)  for about 10 years now.     The Impact Our country and even our world have seemed to be in an uproar lately, with many left feeling lost and in tremendous fear. United we stand; divided we fall, and our world needs healing more than ever. Music is a universal language that unifies and speaks directly to the heart. Kristin and I have personally experienced the healing power of music and are devoted to paying that forward and continuing to create more music that heals and inspires all of us to live a full and empowered life. We ALL deserve to experience love. And when we feel love, we are likely to share more love in service to others while bringing forth our gifts into a greater purpose. But no one can do this alone. We are ALL here to support one another. That's why this project is so important... The more people we can reach and inspire with our music, the more people that could be inspired to heal their wounds. And when we free ourselves (and others) from our wounds, our hearts open, we feel connected to the world around us, and move with more compassion and wisdom. IMAGINE a world where LOVE and KINDNESS motivate us rather than fear; a world working in harmony to uplift and EMPOWER everyone. Welcome to the vision of Bhakti House Band music!   On top of all our music's healing power, proceeds from ALL our music efforts go to support impoverished children around the world with food, education, and medical care through our Peace Love OM Project, a project under CLEF (Conscious Living Empowerment Foundation) a 501(c)3 we founded.  It's time to celebrate expand the diverse and colorful world around us, as it is expressed through nature and humanity!  Holi Festival of Colors, 2016  This NEW ALBUM called ROOTS TO REVOLUTIONS(incremental release begins February 18, 2019)... This Indiegogo campaign is to create and distribute a new album, which will draw from our roots like never before.

<p>Dear friends, it's been a couple of years since I did the ""Balladeer"" CD campaign and raised enough funds from your generosity!

<h3>My Story</h3>
<p>For years, while a member of the band <a href=""http://www.fiveam.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"" title=""Five A.M."">Five A.M</a>, I have been trying to create music that speaks to not only people's hearts but their souls.  As the band begins to close the door on it's career a window has opened for me as a songwriter.  Over a year ago I was somewhat depressed as I began to realize Five A.M. was not going to rise to the heights I had wanted.  In the midst of that winter more and more songs began to pour out of me.  Not rock songs but simple - sparse songs that pointed towards the struggle of living a deeper, passionate, and spiritual life.  It was music I have been writing and setting aside for years, but was now ready to come out.  At a retreat in the mountains of Oregon I ran into an incredible violin player, Duane Whitcomb, who opened up these new songs even further.  I played  a few solo concerts and found that this music resonated people.  I received emails and had long talks with strangers who were moved by these new songs.  I was asked repeatedly where my music could be found and purchased but I didn't have anything.  After many, many restless nights I have decided to do something I have a hard time doing.....ask for help.  I don't have the money to record, so I am asking for people to pre-buy the CD or give more, if you feel so inclined.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Music</h3>
<p>The new record is called <i><b>Birdwings</b></i>.  Rumi says that throughout our life we let go of and hold things tightly.  If our hands were always a fist, or always stretched open, we would be paralyzed.  In the middle is the truth.  The songs for this record follow that theme.  I am trying to broaden what people define as spiritual - deeper - heart music.  This coming summer I have been asked to perform at a few big events.  This CD will help me to leave a message behind once the show is over.</p>
<p><br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>At a minimum I need 5,000 bucks to pay for studio time, an engineer, guest musicians (piano, cello...etc), mixing, mastering and print fees.  No money will be used for new instruments or gas in my car to get to the studio or anything else besides direct recording.  A day in the studio costs $480.  5 days for me to record vocals and guitar tracks plus a couple days to lay piano, violin, cello and strings and the cost is already at $3,360.  Add to that two days of mxing and mastering and we are at $4320.  Print fees for 300 cd's plus itunes set up costs $600.  So as you can see I am budgeting very tight.  I will also be putting in my own money and any money I make at solo gigs to the project.  I am calling in some favors from my musician friends so many of them are donating their time to help me out.  I know money is tight for everyone so I am trying to make the most out of as little as possible but I do guarantee you will love the album once it is finished.  If it ends up people donate MORE than the $5,000 asked for, well, fantastic!  That will allow me to not have to rush as much through the studio.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p>I have included some cool perks for those of you that can do more than $20.  You can tell me an idea, story, or about a person you would like me to write a song about.  You can tell me all about your girlfriend or fiancée and I will write a song that expresses your feelings or story.  We can grab a beer together and talk about the music or life.  I will come to your house and play a house concert or maybe play for just you and your friends.   You can come in to the studio and observe the recording process.  Regardless of all the perks anyway you can help is appreciated.</p>

At a minimum I need 5,000 bucks to pay for studio time, an engineer, guest musicians (piano, cello...etc), mixing, mastering and print fees.  No money will be used for new instruments or gas in my car to get to the studio or anything else besides direct recording.  A day in the studio costs $480.  5 days for me to record vocals and guitar tracks plus a couple days to lay piano, violin, cello and strings and the cost is already at $3,360.  Add to that two days of mxing and mastering and we are at $4320.  Print fees for 300 cd's plus itunes set up costs $600.  So as you can see I am budgeting very tight.  I will also be putting in my own money and any money I make at solo gigs to the project.  I am calling in some favors from my musician friends so many of them are donating their time to help me out.  I know money is tight for everyone so I am trying to make the most out of as little as possible but I do guarantee you will love the album once it is finished.  If it ends up people donate MORE than the $5,000 asked for, well, fantastic!  That will allow me to not have to rush as much through the studio.

I have included some cool perks for those of you that can do more than $20.  You can tell me an idea, story, or about a person you would like me to write a song about.  You can tell me all about your girlfriend or fiancée and I will write a song that expresses your feelings or story.  We can grab a beer together and talk about the music or life.  I will come to your house and play a house concert or maybe play for just you and your friends.   You can come in to the studio and observe the recording process.  Regardless of all the perks anyway you can help is appreciated.

These are estimates that we will break down for you.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<b>Recording</b> (<i>1500 euros):</i><br/>Yes, this sounds like a ""steal"", but because the venue has everything set up and other bands will film at the festival, plus the fact that coming home to ProgPower always is welcoming, this is what we pay for the raw material.<br/><i>More info regarding this can be seen above in the Production section.</i>
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<b>Editing </b><i>(</i><i>6000 euros):</i><br/>This is needed to make the 2,5 hour footage of all 8 cameras a one and coherent film to enjoy. Making sure you have a good-looking release of over 2 hours, will undoubtly be the biggest part of the ""cake"" shown above.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<b>Artwork </b><i>(1500 euros):</i><br/>This includes the two-sided shirts, album cover and booklets, the photo book cover and all the massive work around this - basically many small details that you will not notice if it is done right, that would stand out like a sore thumb if it isn't... We will give you updates about the progress here through Indiegogo whenever we feel there is something to report. </div>
<div>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Distribution </b><i>(2000 euros):</i><br/>Eventually, though you as a funder get the release before the masses, we need to distribute this product both physically and digitally.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Perks </b><i>(5000 euros):</i><br/>Making the funder happy, is our greatest concern! This part of the budget involves all the costs to produce, print and ship all the perks that you may purchase. The 5000 might sound a bit inflated, but we know how people drop their jaws when we include shipping from one of the most expensive countries in the world. We have toyed with the idea of shipping from elsewhere, and that might be cheaper, but then we are hammered with import and export tolls as well, so we need to leave the estimated costs for perks at this level to make sure we can afford to make you proud to be a part of this. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Printing </b><i>(1000 euros):</i><br/>We leave this in here for manufacturing costs tied to the distribution part described above.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Audio Mix </b><i>(3000 euros):</i><br/>Last but definitely not least are the costs for the audio mixes. We intend to go for two audio streams; a 5,1 Surround Sound audiotrack and a normal AC3 2.0 audio stream, and will keep you updated.</p>

</div>
</div><div>
<div>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>
<h3> </h3>
<p>A big project like this means risks and challenges. We can not deny that, but we are confident we will overcome them all. After having performed countless concerts under all kinds of circumstances, and produced and released a live album/DVD once before, we like to believe that we know the factors that come into play when producing<i> Full Circle</i>. Still, we want you to know what could ultimately happen if things go south.</p>
<p>The release could be delayed due to many reasons, like printing/distribution/editing delays and such. In any case, you will be updated. </p>
<p>Also, there is the chance of this campaign not reaching the goal that we set. That would be a big challenge for us, but we will release<i>Full Cirlce </i>no matter what, and all perks will be delivered as long as the recording process goes the way we expect. <br/>If the raw material leaves us disappointed and we know early on that this release will not be for you to cherish and for us to be proud of,  we will refund all the money to the respective owners. For you, this means no risk.</p>
<p>Other than that, most challenges are on a musical level, which is for us to deal with.  </p>

As a result, we ask you to become part of the circle, make our vision a reality, and bring this special night to everyone's screen. With your participation, Full Circle will be another live DVD for you to enjoy to the fullest, and for us to be proud of.
Our goal is to reach 20.000 Euros. This is the estimated budget we need to make a world class production and bring the experience to you ""as if you were there"".

 
Your investment will allow us to have great artwork, high quality editing and the kind of audio mix that we are known for; the one that you deserve to hear.  
More information about the costs estimation can be found below.

COSTS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This part of the description is dedicated to the costs of the project, basically where your money will go to. These are estimates that we will break down for you.
 

Recording (1500 euros):Yes, this sounds like a ""steal"", but because the venue has everything set up and other bands will film at the festival, plus the fact that coming home to ProgPower always is welcoming, this is what we pay for the raw material.More info regarding this can be seen above in the Production section.

 

Editing (6000 euros):This is needed to make the 2,5 hour footage of all 8 cameras a one and coherent film to enjoy. Making sure you have a good-looking release of over 2 hours, will undoubtly be the biggest part of the ""cake"" shown above.
 

Artwork (1500 euros):This includes the two-sided shirts, album cover and booklets, the photo book cover and all the massive work around this - basically many small details that you will not notice if it is done right, that would stand out like a sore thumb if it isn't... We will give you updates about the progress here through Indiegogo whenever we feel there is something to report. 

 
Distribution (2000 euros):Eventually, though you as a funder get the release before the masses, we need to distribute this product both physically and digitally.
 
Perks (5000 euros):Making the funder happy, is our greatest concern! This part of the budget involves all the costs to produce, print and ship all the perks that you may purchase. The 5000 might sound a bit inflated, but we know how people drop their jaws when we include shipping from one of the most expensive countries in the world. We have toyed with the idea of shipping from elsewhere, and that might be cheaper, but then we are hammered with import and export tolls as well, so we need to leave the estimated costs for perks at this level to make sure we can afford to make you proud to be a part of this. 
 
Printing (1000 euros):We leave this in here for manufacturing costs tied to the distribution part described above.  
 
Audio Mix (3000 euros):Last but definitely not least are the costs for the audio mixes. We intend to go for two audio streams; a 5,1 Surround Sound audiotrack and a normal AC3 2.0 audio stream, and will keep you updated.




-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RISKS & CHALLENGES


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
A big project like this means risks and challenges. We can not deny that, but we are confident we will overcome them all. After having performed countless concerts under all kinds of circumstances, and produced and released a live album/DVD once before, we like to believe that we know the factors that come into play when producing Full Circle. Still, we want you to know what could ultimately happen if things go south.
The release could be delayed due to many reasons, like printing/distribution/editing delays and such. In any case, you will be updated. 
Also, there is the chance of this campaign not reaching the goal that we set. That would be a big challenge for us, but we will releaseFull Cirlce no matter what, and all perks will be delivered as long as the recording process goes the way we expect. If the raw material leaves us disappointed and we know early on that this release will not be for you to cherish and for us to be proud of,  we will refund all the money to the respective owners. For you, this means no risk.
Other than that, most challenges are on a musical level, which is for us to deal with.

""It's a story for Us. Of how we learn through challenge. 


The tale of an afternoon's heartbreak turning us inside to know ourselves more deeply. 


A winding journey through forests of giving ourselves permission


over and over again


to be exactly as we Are.


It's the sound of the wind breathing, turned into notes so we can carry them.


The images of the inner eye


dreamt by the one who dreams himself awake


the divine theater, where we sing 


as though never were a limit to the reaches of the voice...It's all that's Beheld.""~ Ayla Nereo

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Janie Lidey and I have been a singer-songwriter for nearly all my life. I have produced 4 albums in Alaska over the past ten years and am now producing my 5th project in Nashville, Tennessee. The album will feature 10 original songs co-written by myself and two other Nashville writers. </p>
<p>This project is unique in that it combines the 10 song CD with the release of my first book, both titled, 'The Magic of A Song'.  My message: Find your passion, lose your fear, leap with faith, live the life of your dreams. </p>
<p>Your gracious contributions to this project will enable me to 'leap with faith' into sharing stories and songs with a message that I believe will make a difference in people's lives.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The cost of this project is close to 20,000 dollars. That includes self-publishing fees for the book, art work, graphics, photos, studio time, musicians fees, mixing, mastering, duplicating... I am asking for your help in raising 10,800 dollars to cover some of those costs. </p>
<p>I am putting together a fun list of perks for your contributions including  signed CDs, signed books, t-shirts, house concerts, corporate concerts and a chance to have your name and or your company logo on a special acknowledgement page in my book.

<h3><span style=""text-decoration: underline;"">What Up</span></h3>
<p>Hey, I'm Joel. I'm a singer/songwriter living in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and also a theatre artist! I act, write, compose, improvise, produce, etc, etc. I've played the piano since I was 7, and developed a pretty unique style - a jazz/pop/rock combination reminiscent of Billy Joel, Tom Waits, or Peter Gabriel. I'm raising money to record a 10-song debut album over the summer of 2012, for release in the fall. The songs are completely new - written on my recent four-month European/African backpacking trip, where I did the following INTERESTING THINGS THAT INSPIRED MY MUSIC:</p>
<p>-Walked 1000km through Northern Spain on the Camino de Santiago de Compostela</p>
<p>-Joined the crew of a square-rigged sailing cargo vessel, The Tres Hombres, for a month from Portugal to Madeira to the Canary Islands to Capo Verde</p>
<p>-Performed in Spain, Portugal, Madeira, Capo Verde, Italy, Germany, Czech Republic, and Austria</p>
-Slept on the street. Just once, though.<br/><br/>I've got some older material too, which is mostly about girls and stuff.</div>
<div>

</div></div>","What Up
Hey, I'm Joel. I'm a singer/songwriter living in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and also a theatre artist! I act, write, compose, improvise, produce, etc, etc. I've played the piano since I was 7, and developed a pretty unique style - a jazz/pop/rock combination reminiscent of Billy Joel, Tom Waits, or Peter Gabriel. I'm raising money to record a 10-song debut album over the summer of 2012, for release in the fall. The songs are completely new - written on my recent four-month European/African backpacking trip, where I did the following INTERESTING THINGS THAT INSPIRED MY MUSIC:
-Walked 1000km through Northern Spain on the Camino de Santiago de Compostela
-Joined the crew of a square-rigged sailing cargo vessel, The Tres Hombres, for a month from Portugal to Madeira to the Canary Islands to Capo Verde
-Performed in Spain, Portugal, Madeira, Capo Verde, Italy, Germany, Czech Republic, and Austria
-Slept on the street. Just once, though.I've got some older material too, which is mostly about girls and stuff.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi, my name is Jeremy Drinkwine.  My band is called DRINKWINE cause, why not, right?  I was born and raised in Tennessee.  I have been passionately creating music and writing songs most of my life.  I have a family with four amazing kids and believe that leading by example and pursuing my dream will only give my kids the encouragement they need to do the same.  </p>
<p>This campaign exists to raise the money needed to complete a full length 10 song album of songs I've written over the past 2 years.  This is it ya'll, my dream in a Compact Disc.  I have several songs finished already due to the generosity of some folk's time and a small loan to get us started which will be paid back in full as our goal is met.  </p>
<p>If you decide to participate you will be helping me give back to the world the gift that I've been given in music and writing songs.  This is your opportunity to be a part of a dream.  Thank you so much for your contribution and support.  </p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So, in a nutshell, my goal is $22,000.  Sounds like a lot right?  It's somebody's new Honda for sure.  Well, to record 10 songs it will take $17,000 for production and studio time,  $3,000 to have it Mixed and Mastered, and another $2,000 to have the CD's other merchandise designed, pressed and released.</p>
<p>There are many different levels I've broken down below that give you a choice of how much you can contribute along with the perks you will receive based on the dollar amount such as signed CD's, lyric sheets, Shout Outs, T-shirts, bumper stickers, posters, signatured bottles and cases of wine, personal videos, house concerts etc...  I have done my best to make it fair but remember this is more or less like donating to a good cause, you just happen to be getting something cool in return, cause you're awesome!!</p>
<p>I fully believe the goal of $22,000 will be met.  However, in the event that it isn't there are plans in place to use what money we do raise to finish the project anyway.  Dreams don't die, they adjust.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Guys, this is it!  This is where a dream meets the world.  This is where art is appreciated by more than just friends and family.  This is who I am. It's who I was born to be.  You are not only investing into the gift God has given me, but you are giving a gift to the world by funding this project into existence.  </p>
<p>These campaigns work.  Travel the IndieGoGo website and see for yourself.  Thousands of dreams and gifts to the world have been realized through contributions like yours.  This works!!  </p>
<p>I am but one artist in a sea of millions dreaming, but you can make mine a reality.  I am honored to have been given this gift of songwriting and music and can not wait to give it back with your help!!</p>

Hi & welcome to my first crowd-funding project.  Recording my next album in Nashville is going to be a mind boggling experience & I'm very excited about having you all involved in this next project of mine.

The idea of having the public & fans of all music contributing to my next recording and offering something in return is very appealing.  For the past year or two I have been madly writing songs for an album titled, Foolish Things and really enjoying  the process & how the songs have arrived.  Foolish Things has songs about love, loss, friendships, good times, bad times & even Windmills.  What's not to love about Windmills?
This album is very important to me because these songs come directly from my heart & what can be more personal than that? It's a very special way of connecting with absolutely anyone, anywhere in the world and I love the feeling i get when people in the crowd are singing the words to my own songs.  What a buzz! 
Foolish Things is to follow up on the success of my first album, Taking Goodbye which had some serious chart success here in Australia, scored several songwriting awards & introduced me to the industry & country music fans around the country.  
I love being an independent artist and wouldn't have it any other way but with your support & funding, which will go directly towards flights, accommodation, studio costs & film clips, I'll be able to promote my album amongst the best of em!
 
Where will The Money Go?
Good question;
*Flights from Adelaide to Nashville 
*Accommodation for 10 days in Nashville 
*studio hire       
*Film clip contribution to promote the finish product
I have suggested that $5000 would be my target and I will be thrilled with any support I get.  Any $'s over that will mean I can continue to promote the album with film clips & radio releases which all cost phenomenal amounts of money.
 
My Perks
I have tried to make my perks as attractive as possible & make them unique and fun, so I hope you can find something in there that appeals so we both win!
They can be as simple as a CD order, right through to your very own gig or appearing in a film clip.

Brian has friends all over, and this is a great way for those who can't make it, to help Brian and his children is their time of need. </p>

<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>   My goal is to raise as much money as we can so Brian can take one concern off of his plate, and so he can focus on his health, and his family. I set the bar at $20,000 but more is just fine! People who help out will get a CD, DVD, or both of the live stage perfomances being held at Siggys on the 21st. Who knows you may be getting an early recording of a star, and with the talent we have in the line up, it's VERY possible. Most of all you get the satisfaction of helpping a great guy when he needs it the most. Unlike most charities where you donate, and wonder where the money goes, in this instance you KNOW it is going directly to a family that needs your help! </p>

<h3>Your contribution:</h3>
<p>Back in the day when Record labels would fund recordings, known as an ""Advance"". Meaning the artist doesn't make a dime from record sales until the advance is recouped. That is why the artist/band tour, to generate an income from playing and to generate the sale of records to pay back the advance.  BUT, today it is the artist who funds these projects.  That is why we need your help. You will become our ""virtual"" shareholders by pre-ordering the CD or contributing to one of the ""PERKS"" we have set up. You help us with the funding we need to finish this CD.  Which in turn allows us get back out there and do what we love to do, PLAY LIVE and deliver to you a ""HIT AFTER  HIT"" ""ROCK AND ROLL FANTASY""show that you ""CAN'T GET ENOUGH"" of. A show that will stay with you for years to come.  <strong>BAND COMPANY delivers to you the heart and soul of the music of PAUL RODGERS </strong></p>
<p><strong>BAND COMPANY</strong> will use this funding to complete the tribute CD along with a promotional video and media ad campaign to promote the release of the CD. $15,000 is needed to complete this project, which is underway. $3,500 will be used on the video, $6,500 on the media ad campaign, manufacturing and licensing. If we reach our goal with your help we will be on our way to finish everything, even if we don't, we will make every attempt to get the perks out to everyone, be patient though, it will take a little longer to complete everything.  Thank you in advance for your support.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I've been really excited to start this campaign since the minute i heard about Indie GoGo This is such a great way to bring fans, family and friends together to create something unique and professional without those big scary record labels telling us what to do or how to do it.., and I think this is going to be an awesome and fun way to make my next full-length record.</p>
<p>We only have 45 DAYS to meet the goal, though, so PLEEEASE tell your friends to check out this page. Facebook ,Twitter, Emails, Letters (if anyone still does that) to help spread the word online. Everyone who donates gets a hug and a kiss ,even if your a guy so pucker up, just comes with the package. </p>
<p><br/>**Please return here often to check the ""Updates"" tab, where I'll be posting new videos and keeping everyone posted on the progress. THANK YOU SO MUCH!</p>
<p>You might be asking these questions:</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>$30K may seem like a nice chunk of change, but to be honest, it's really JUST ENOUGH to make the kind of album I'm going for--an album that will compete on ANY level in today's musical world. Major labels today typically spend around $200,000 merely recording the album--I'm planning to work with 15% of that (Trust me,as an indie artist i've learned how to pinch a penny or two) Monies left over from recording (if there are any) will be put towards local radio promotion and touring.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I'll be honest, i've slacked over the last few years ha ha. Not in my work ethic but just forget about my music. Friends and family members have told me i should record another album but i've been so busy writing for others that i became kind of lost, working with labels, a&amp;r,managers blah blah blah. But recently the fire was sparked by my close friend and business partner Vicki Holmes who gave me a swift kick in the arse and said get out there buddy. Truly, YOUR contribution is  like helping me fly again. I've been in the studio almost everyday this past month coming up with song ideas and new sounds. Hopefully when you hear the record it will take you somewhere as well. Let's fly together!</p>
