<p><strong>Our story:</strong></p>
<p>The Emmy nominated - BEACON HILL the SERIES  is back by popular demand for Season Two with longer episodes, positive LGBTQ representation, juicy romance, intrigue and political drama...all spearheaded by our Executive Producer Crystal Chappell, the Emmy Winning actress and producer of ""Otalia"" , Days of our Lives and Venice the Series fame.</p>
<p>Hi. My name is Jessica and I’m one of the Creators and Producers of BEACON HILL the SERIES. Our story began in the summer of 2013. My writing partner Linda and I were talking about some of the television shows that we missed.  Shows like <i>The West Wing </i>and <i>Dallas, ER</i> and <i>Dynasty</i>.  We were also lamenting the loss of so many daytime dramas that had been cancelled in recent years.</p>
<p>Soon we were daydreaming about the kind of show we’d love to see.  Something smart with great dialog that focused on strong female relationships.  We enjoy politics so that had to be included.  But we also missed those old soapy dramas and we wanted to see shows that delved deep into relationships between star crossed lovers and families who harbor secrets.  And finally, we wanted to see ourselves represented on the screen.  Strong, successful women who just happen to be gay.</p>
<p>We wanted to watch a drama.  A drama full of political corruption and intrigue, family connections and betrayal, and of course—there had to be romance. Lots of romance.</p>
<p>So as crazy as it sounds, we decided to write and produce the show ourselves.</p>
<p>In 2014 we were extremely fortunate to partner with Emmy winning actress and producer Crystal Chappell—who has produced her own Emmy-winning drama <i>Venice</i> <i>the</i> <i>Series, </i>which is now entering its sixth season.  We were lucky enough to have a dream cast of daytime actors who came on board and brought our show to life.</p>
<p>We self-funded Season One and were thrilled by the overwhelming response.  That first season received three daytime Emmy nominations, including one for <i>Outstanding New Approaches Drama.</i> We could not have been more proud of the incredible work of the entire cast and crew, and everyone who helped make our dream come true.</p>
<p><strong>Who we are:</strong></p>
<p>We run Bella Books, one of the largest independent lgbtq book publishers in the US.  Bella focuses on publishing stories by women, written for women. Our goal is always to promote storytelling that tells our stories—through books and now through film. We want to create content that show both women and men in all of their wonderfully complex and layered possibilities. <i>Beacon Hill</i> is the first of what we hope will be many productions.</p>
<p><strong>Season Two:</strong></p>
<p>So <i>Beacon Hill</i> is finally back for Season Two with an amazing script.  In addition to the great cast coming back from Season One, we’re absolutely thrilled about the new actors joining in on the fun.  We’re welcoming the incredible Marem Hassler of <i>Riley Parra</i> fame, Hillary B. Smith from  <i>One Life to Live</i> and <i>General Hospital</i>, Jacob Young of <i>All My Children, Bold and Beautiful</i> and <i>General Hospital </i>and Nadia Bjorlin from <i>Days of our Lives </i>and<i> Venice.</i></p>
<p><strong>Why are we crowdsourcing this season?</strong></p>
<p>Creating content out of the mainstream of television is always a challenge. Shows that feature lgbtq characters present even more challenges when trying to find a path through the traditional route of streaming and broadcast television. That’s why we’re producing it ourselves. We are passionate about telling our stories. Stories that matter. Stories that entertain.  But as you know, filming a big sweeping drama with an amazing cast of actors is expensive. Filming on location in Boston is even more so. </p>
<p><strong>What will the money be used for?</strong></p>
<p>Our cast is split between east and west coasts and we have to get them all to the same New England location. Travel for the cast and crew for Season Two is over $10,000. Hotels for everyone to stay during filming, which this year is nine days, will be $13,000. So you can see how things start to really add up.</p>
<p><strong>Longer Episodes Please!</strong></p>
<p>After season one, we heard from our fans. They wanted longer episodes! And we want to make our fans happy. But longer episodes mean we need more production and post production funds. In addition to hotel and travel, all of the money raised will go to cover our production costs like cameras, lighting, and sound equipment rentals.  It will be used to pay the crew and incredible cast for all of their hard work and long hours spent creating magic. Then of course we have to feed our cast and crew for those nine days – 3 meals a day. This production follows SAG/AFTRA rules, which means we are doing things by the book. We have to have liability insurance which is a must when filming on location. We have wardrobe, hair &amp; makeup and transportation costs. Once filming is done we need funds for post-production that include editing, sound, music and color correction so that everyone’s hard work ends up looking and sounding good.</p>
<p>This is where you come in. We need your help making Season Two a reality. Our Season Two script is AMAZING. It’s full of SURPRISES, PASSION, ROMANCE and yes—it has the answer to the longest cliffhanger ever—<i>Who’s at the damn door?</i></p>
<p>And did I mention the episodes are longer? So I’m asking you to help us make this the BEST Season EVER! Help us bring Season Two of <i>Beacon Hill</i> to life. We promise an amazing ride.</p>
<p>We’re grateful for every single penny that comes our way. No amount is too small or too big! And we have some wonderful perks and incentives to show our gratitude.</p>
<p>We have lunches, meet and greets with cast and crew. We have set visits and even some early viewing of Episode One! We have the usual but always awesome <i>Beacon Hill</i> swag like shirts and hats and hoodies.  And of course whiskey glasses so that you can drink like Claire! And we have unique and personalized one-of-a-kind perks that include phones calls with cast members.</p>
<p>If you haven’t watched Season One of <i>Beacon Hill</i>, we invite you to take a look now!  Visit <a href=""https://BeaconHillTheSeries.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">https://BeaconHillTheSeries.com</a> for trailers and episodes from last season.</p>

Our goal is to cover just $2,500 of that through this campaign, though any donations above our goal will go toward our additional costs.TimelinePre-production: March 2017 ✔ Filming: April - September 2017 ✔Editing: December 2017 - January 2018Estimated Release: February 2018Festivals: TBD 2018 and 2019Risks and challengesWe’ve already filmed all the raw footage and we’ve secured a discounted rate for editing. The riskiest expense for us, at this point, is festival submissions; we obviously can’t guarantee Murdery Heights will get into anything we submit, though we believe we have a quality product that stands out from the pack.There is also always the risk of hidden costs for which we are not accounting.I can't give money. How else can I help?Spread the word! Tell people about this campaign on Facebook, Twitter, email, Snapchat, or old time-y parchment!Thank you!",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Emma &amp; Christy - Webseries Pilot</h3>
<p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">What is it about?</b></p>
<p>The Emma &amp; Christy webseries will follow two best friends as they navigate through life, romance, and adulting in a way that is comedic and unconventional. </p>
<p><strong>The Pilot</strong></p>
<p>One night Emma &amp; Christy get together to share life's mishaps. Christy learns she needs to stay current with the dating scene and Emma is shaken up after discovering her boyfriend's unusual preference of adult entertainment (hint: it involves stuffed animals!). Christy comes up with the wild idea for them to team up as business partners and enter the mysterious world of Plushies. If they learn to balance out each others strengths and weaknesses, they might find what they've both been searching for.</p>

<p>With this project, we wanted to first make people laugh and enjoy themselves, cuz who doesn't want that?! BUT, we also wanted to touch on  subjects that are still taboo and shameful in today's society. Something like, oh I don't know, sex and sexual preferences to start with. Another theme of our story will be Emma and Christy's journey from a place of weakness to female empowerment. Through our story, we hope to broaden perspectives, erase prejudices and encourage acceptance of one another. </p>

<h2><strong>Roofs – It’s what we do!</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Have you ever used Home Advisor? Thumbtack?</strong> or any other service that puts you in touch with a professional contractor to undertake a project of yours? </p>
<p>There was a time when people opened the yellow pages to find a contractor, but those days are long gone.  These days, people go to the web.  Customers ‘Google’ roofing services or they go to Home Advisor, Thumbtack or other sites or apps.  That’s all fine to a point but it’s all somewhat random.  These online marketplaces are mostly ‘jack of all trades’. <i><strong> </strong></i></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i><strong>Roofhub.com is different.</strong></i></p>
<p>There are over 120 million houses in the United States and millions of commercial buildings.</p>
<p><i><strong>Every one of them has a roof.  It’s important!</strong></i></p>

<p>The roof is the building’s first line defense against the elements.  The roof is the most abused part of any building so when you need a roofing service you want to ensure that you get the best service available, and that means verified professionals you can rely on.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<p>10 years ago I sat my father down and explained how people would watch film, tv, and sports in the future. After listening to my story Dads eyes got wide. ""This is going to be big!"" he said, ""you're going to change the world!"" </p>
<p> Laughingly I told him I appreciated his support, but I didn't have any money to build the systems I was talking about.  Besides, all the huge internet corporations were well on their way. They should have things working properly in the next few months....</p>
<p> 10 years later we still don’t have the options Dad and I spoke about on that day. The industry is ready to evolve, and the power needs to be given back to the people. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What are the issues?? </strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p> The problem is that we are only seeing what <strong><i>they</i></strong> want us to see. We only get to watch the things that have been approved by the board of whatever corporation has the money to produce these things. </p>
<p> Sure we have youtube. But why are the artist that I watch a few hours every week earning at or below the poverty line? If people like watching their videos where is the money for additional content? How long will it be before the cost of creating is too much and the creators stop creating? </p>
<p>Don’t think the money isn’t there. Billions of people stream video every day. Billions with a B. Someone is making a lot from what people are watching. But its not the creators. </p>
<p>“If you’re a series regular on a network TV show, you’re getting a good amount of money, Yet you can have half a million followers on YouTube and still be working at Starbucks.” - Alice Marwick, assistant professor of communication at the University of North Carolina </p>
<p><strong>The world needs an <i>unfiltered</i> variety of content, and the creators need funding to create!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong> Building the change</strong></h3>
<p> telly:D will put people and corporations on a level playing field in a way the world has never seen before, but we have to build it first!</p>
<p> </p>
<p> We are starting from nothing. By that I mean we have no code of our own, no server space to host with. What we <strong>do</strong> have is a goal, a solid plan, a domain and a logo to rally around. To me this is a huge advantage. Starting from scratch allows us to create exactly what we need.

</div></div>","10 years ago I sat my father down and explained how people would watch film, tv, and sports in the future. After listening to my story Dads eyes got wide. ""This is going to be big!"" he said, ""you're going to change the world!"" 
 Laughingly I told him I appreciated his support, but I didn't have any money to build the systems I was talking about.  Besides, all the huge internet corporations were well on their way. They should have things working properly in the next few months....
 10 years later we still don’t have the options Dad and I spoke about on that day. The industry is ready to evolve, and the power needs to be given back to the people. 
 
What are the issues?? 
 
 The problem is that we are only seeing what they want us to see. We only get to watch the things that have been approved by the board of whatever corporation has the money to produce these things. 
 Sure we have youtube. But why are the artist that I watch a few hours every week earning at or below the poverty line? If people like watching their videos where is the money for additional content? How long will it be before the cost of creating is too much and the creators stop creating? 
Don’t think the money isn’t there. Billions of people stream video every day. Billions with a B. Someone is making a lot from what people are watching. But its not the creators. 
“If you’re a series regular on a network TV show, you’re getting a good amount of money, Yet you can have half a million followers on YouTube and still be working at Starbucks.” - Alice Marwick, assistant professor of communication at the University of North Carolina 
The world needs an unfiltered variety of content, and the creators need funding to create!
 
 Building the change
 telly:D will put people and corporations on a level playing field in a way the world has never seen before, but we have to build it first!
 
 We are starting from nothing. By that I mean we have no code of our own, no server space to host with. What we do have is a goal, a solid plan, a domain and a logo to rally around. To me this is a huge advantage. Starting from scratch allows us to create exactly what we need. Working together we will look to the future, we can put the building blocks exactly where we need them to form a strong foundation.
  Taking a stand with the BIG guys who control the industry wont be easy.  It means we will need our own code. It means our own servers, and an app to tie it all in. But it also means dollars.   
  We need $1.5 million dollars. But you are not alone! If we had 1 cent for every time someone saw Charlie Bit My Finger we would have over $8 million, and I know you saw the video….
  Together, for the cost of a Starbucks, we can escape the claws of the industry and shape our own future! Together we can build the freedom that you deserve.

<p>Our mission is to document an Asian narrative that's largely been untold. The Midwest is so often painted as a bland, uninteresting region where nothing ever happens.

<p>We've gotten $1000 seed funding from Project Pengyou, a flagship initiative of the Golden Bridges Foundation that fosters U.S.-China youth leadership, which is enough to cover food costs for teams to go to locations in the Midwest to shoot.  However, we're unable to compensate for all travel expenses, equipment, and distribution costs for the project right now. All filmmakers that are part of the project are also volunteering days of their time and getting time off from work to take part. We want to be able to compensate for their time on this project as well. We'd love to pay for music use rights from Asian music companies like 88Rising, compensate our amazing graphic designer who's working on all the title cards and transitions, give our marketing team a budget to spread this narrative out into the world, and so much more.</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Miss Misery <i>is the story of anxious millennials using the overabundance of dating options available to them to avoid their real problems.</i></strong></p>
<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>Amy and Jay have been dating for three years and hit a slump. Amy has stopped showing up for her job at the laundromat. Jay is noodling through a graduate degree in ethnomusicology. They really need to talk. But you know what sounds a lot more fun? Having sex with other people.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Lee, Amy's best friend, proves that sex with randos isn't any easier. Lee's exhausted by the grind of Instagram upkeep and the management of a million half-baked Tinder and Bumble convos. And now she’s shook up by the offer of a promotion that might take her away from a dream career she's basically never pursued. Her solution? Just date harder.</p>
<p>This is where Miss Misery starts, and it goes just as badly as you would imagine. Awkward dates, confusing threesomes, illegal crushes on neighbours and coworkers, and running into your boss at a sex club – it's misery.</p>
<p>Based on true stories and slightly exaggerated anecdotes, this is a sitcom-style web series of four 15-minute episodes that tells a full narrative arc from start to finish.  Made by a team of award-winning writers and producers, this project is years in the making and very close to our hearts.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Our Story</h3>
<p>Two years ago, we (Jade and Steve) were living together and talking about our successes and humiliations of dating. We also talked a lot about TV, and movies, and what we liked and what we didn’t. There was so much good material in our own lives, we started to develop a kind of shorthand – ""that's content!"" It seemed obvious. We had to make a show.</p>
<p>We knew we could make something that reflected the truth, good and bad, of what we saw and experienced. While so many shows and films focus on dating, they didn’t necessarily get into the realities of either short or long-term relationships.</p>
<p>Having both experimented with open relationships, we decided polyamory would be a good way of exploring a wide range of dating dynamics – and a theme was born. We agreed that depicting one single character would allow us to riff on short-term dating, while depicting a couple would let us get into the complexities of long-term relationships – the less flashy parts of love, like honesty, communication, and being brave enough to open up about your wants and fears.</p>
<p>We've been writing scripts and tinkering with plot points and puzzling out themes for this show for the last two years, and now we're finally super excited to complete it and show it the world!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; Next Steps</h3>
<p>We have all four episodes written, we have actors cast, locations scouted, an amazing cinematographer on board, and an incredible crew. What we need is to secure this final part of our funding so we can begin shooting in earnest.<br/><br/>The amount we need to to do that is $19,500 (CDN). This will cover producing, shooting and basic post-production for  four 12-17 minute long episodes. Here’s how it will be spent:</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Welcome true believers! We’re Pixel Brain Productions, and we’re here to chew bubble gum and produce<strong> Bagged &amp; Bored Season Two</strong>... and we're all out of bubble gum. So let's get to it - with your help of course!</p>
<p>Our origin story begins with a healthy dose of video games, comic book culture, and a penchant for visual storytelling. This led us to our very first film, entitled <strong>Zach Cooper’s Epic Speedrun</strong>, a video game caper that quickly developed a rabid cult following and would become the catalyst for our YouTube channel. We’d go on to provide humorous original content, industry quality short films, and promotional material for various comic cons and local businesses. What we lacked in funds, we made up for in creativity, dedication, and a sheen of professionalism.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489898711/xxj8uajtdujsdur6yasu.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In fact, these traits are what led comic shop owner <strong>Brian Barrow</strong> to offer us a rare opportunity to shoot inside his store, <strong>The Destination</strong>. A concept for a quick comedy sketch was developed and shot, featuring Louisville comedians <strong>Kent Carney</strong> and <strong>Jake Reber</strong> heckling customers at the store. After realizing the potential of both the comic shop location and the talent we had to work with, 7 episodes were developed, and <strong>Bagged &amp; Bored</strong> started production in the fall of 2014.</p>

<p>Our series began with no budget, no fans, and a handful of actors; but all of that changed when the first few episodes were released in 2015. While it was initially compared to Kevin Smith’s <strong>Clerks</strong>, our show found its own niche with a strong emphasis on surreal visuals mixed with kinetic storytelling. Factor in the combination of strong character performances with authentic pop culture references, and audiences were thrilled to see what would happen next.

And feel free to binge all 7 episodes back-to-back!</p>
<p>The show also resonated with many people in the Louisville arts community. Before we knew it animators, illustrators, musicians, costume designers, and dozens of actors were wanting to donate their skills to be a part of the series. This influx of talent helped shape the remaining episodes into what they are today. By the end of 2015, it became apparent that this was no longer a simple weekend hobby for a few people - it was a full on commitment, with a loaded arsenal of talent, and a super devoted fan base that craved more. If we wanted to continue the story at the pace and quality we set with our later episodes, then we would need a lot of extra help, resources, <i>and most important of all</i>, funding.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>There’s a phrase we like to say about Pixel Brain projects: “It’s a labor of love, cause it sure ain’t a labor for money!”  We were fortunate during Season One to have had so many people who were passionate enough about the project to donate their time and skills. Cast and crew would skip meals, sacrifice sleep, miss out on opportunities at our day jobs, and we’d pay out of pocket for additional props and gear.  </p>Our “guerrilla style” has led us to getting the most out of our creativity; heck we managed to shoot and produce SEVEN high quality episodes on a shoestring budget and lived to tell about it! We are positive we can achieve NINE epic episodes in Season Two with a bare bones budget of $12,000.<br/> <p>This budget would be used for the following</p>
<ul>
<li>Equipment/Lighting kits</li>
<li>Props and Set Construction</li>
<li>Wardrobe &amp; Costuming</li>
<li>Locations</li>
<li>Catering (we'd really like to eat this time)</li>
<li>Hard drive/media storage</li>
<li>Commission artists for our original comic book title cards</li>
<li>Compensation for our loyal actors and the long crazy hours they give us</li>
</ul>
<p>Oh, then of course there is <strong>YOU</strong>, the loyal backer! With your contribution you will receive NINE hilarious episodes of an awesome web series and the gratification of knowing that you’re helping to make Louisville a bastion for creative endeavors like this! Not to mention all the <strong>perks</strong> you can find in the sidebar!</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><strong>Bagged &amp; Bored</strong> is more than just a web series, it has become a platform for many artists to get recognized for their talents and abilities.

The potential for more episodes of <strong>Bagged &amp; Bored</strong> is an exciting prospect for many comedians, actors, and artists who have yet to be involved in the show’s production but would very much like to!</p>

<p>Regardless of any setbacks we might experience, hard work and perseverance is what separated this show from many other passion projects.

</div></div>","Short Summary
Welcome true believers! We’re Pixel Brain Productions, and we’re here to chew bubble gum and produce Bagged & Bored Season Two... and we're all out of bubble gum. So let's get to it - with your help of course!
Our origin story begins with a healthy dose of video games, comic book culture, and a penchant for visual storytelling. This led us to our very first film, entitled Zach Cooper’s Epic Speedrun, a video game caper that quickly developed a rabid cult following and would become the catalyst for our YouTube channel. We’d go on to provide humorous original content, industry quality short films, and promotional material for various comic cons and local businesses. What we lacked in funds, we made up for in creativity, dedication, and a sheen of professionalism.

In fact, these traits are what led comic shop owner Brian Barrow to offer us a rare opportunity to shoot inside his store, The Destination. A concept for a quick comedy sketch was developed and shot, featuring Louisville comedians Kent Carney and Jake Reber heckling customers at the store. After realizing the potential of both the comic shop location and the talent we had to work with, 7 episodes were developed, and Bagged & Bored started production in the fall of 2014.

Our series began with no budget, no fans, and a handful of actors; but all of that changed when the first few episodes were released in 2015. While it was initially compared to Kevin Smith’s Clerks, our show found its own niche with a strong emphasis on surreal visuals mixed with kinetic storytelling. Factor in the combination of strong character performances with authentic pop culture references, and audiences were thrilled to see what would happen next. Don't believe us? Check out the trailer for Season One. And feel free to binge all 7 episodes back-to-back!
The show also resonated with many people in the Louisville arts community. Before we knew it animators, illustrators, musicians, costume designers, and dozens of actors were wanting to donate their skills to be a part of the series. This influx of talent helped shape the remaining episodes into what they are today. By the end of 2015, it became apparent that this was no longer a simple weekend hobby for a few people - it was a full on commitment, with a loaded arsenal of talent, and a super devoted fan base that craved more. If we wanted to continue the story at the pace and quality we set with our later episodes, then we would need a lot of extra help, resources, and most important of all, funding.

We are positive we can achieve NINE epic episodes in Season Two with a bare bones budget of $12,000. This budget would be used for the following

Equipment/Lighting kits

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The series is Created by Sian Laycock &amp; Joel Stephen Fleming from 13th Street Films, an independent production company from Brisbane, Australia. We are huge fans of Australian comedy and are inspired to make the next great Aussie Comedy Series.</p>
<p>We need your help to make this heartwarming and hilarious story come to life. Your donations would create opportunities for dozens of passionate actors and hard-working crew members/filmmakers.</p>
<h3><strong>SERIES SYNOPSIS</strong></h3>
<p>Welcome to Wrigleton is a six part, half-hour comedy mockumentary, similar in format to shows such as <i>The Office</i>, or <i>Parks and Recreation</i>, but what makes it stand apart from these shows is its uniquely Australian quality. We follow Clint Wrigleton, the ineffectual, yet highly zealous Mayor of the fictional Australian town of Wrigleton.</p>
<p>Clint loves his town, his family; dispirited wife, Laura, and rebellious teenage son Max, and adores his people, the colourful ensemble of ‘Wrigletonian’s’. Their economy has previously relied on the passing tourists heading to the rivalling town of Lake Splendid. Unfortunately, a new highway upgrade redirecting traffic directly to Lake Splendid has meant that they are now dire straits.</p>
<p>This allows the perfect opportunity for Clint’s polar opposite, the suave and charming property developer, Gary Garrison, to swoop in from Lake Splendid and propose a brand-new Mega Mall development that would mark the end of Wrigleton as they know it.</p>
<p>Clint must battle against an ever-shifting public opinion as towns-people begin to fall to Garrison’s charm. He does so by coming up with a variety of schemes each more desperate and ridiculous than the next.</p>
<p>Set to the backdrop of a town event, be it the Bush Dance or the Rugby Cup, each episode follows a new attempt by Clint and his helpers to draw visitors to Wrigleton, from illegal highway diversions, to Ghost Tours and forged Banksy street art, all in an effort to save the towns economy, and, by default, it’s identity.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need </h3>
<p>We need to raise $10,000 so that we can produce an industry level Television Pilot. Your donations would go towards gear, locations, transport and catering for the week long shoot.</p>
<h3><strong>What You Get</strong></h3>
<p><b>We have an array of amazing perks for fans and friends alike:</b></p>

<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/sonnigsburg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Sonnigsburg</a> is a mystery; a town in the woods that hasn't been visited for seventy years. Or so the legend goes. Nearby is the town of Mount Sunshine – and it’s there that our main character, Savannah, stops on her way to research Sonnigsburg.
<br/>
<br/>
Savannah’s ex, Jade, has called her out of the blue, eight years after breaking-up and desperate for help – but when Savannah arrives in town and her past begins to catch up with her, the history of the town begins to seep through the cracks and she realises that the residents of Mount Sunshine are all haunted in their own way.

WHERE THE MONEY GOES

We will be updating you as we go as to where and on what we use the funds, including what we are up to in the filming process.
<br/>

Specifically, we need your help to secure locations, make-up, fuel, equipment-hire, props, costumes and, most importantly of all... food!

<br/>
But really, when it comes down to it ....you'll be helping us make sure that when this goes on TV in 2015, it looks, sounds and feels great! Your donations will help that.<br/><br/>
NB:  The cast and crew are all doing this for free. All the hard work we are putting in is for us to gain valuable experience - and from the goodness of our hearts. Believe us when we say it's hard work because it really is, but it's also oh-so-much fun and extremely rewarding. But while we are working for nothing, some things still cost money.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1172516/files/20150125060218-Sonnigsburg_-_Petra_Elliott_as_Jade.jpg?1422194538"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Photo: Petra Elliott as Jade - episode 1, Sonnigsburg<br/>

a supernatural drama

Sonnigsburg is a mystery; a town in the woods that hasn't been visited for seventy years. Or so the legend goes. Nearby is the town of Mount Sunshine – and it’s there that our main character, Savannah, stops on her way to research Sonnigsburg.


Savannah’s ex, Jade, has called her out of the blue, eight years after breaking-up and desperate for help – but when Savannah arrives in town and her past begins to catch up with her, the history of the town begins to seep through the cracks and she realises that the residents of Mount Sunshine are all haunted in their own way.

FROM RAGS TO FANCIER RAGS



                               


Rock Bottom Productions 
has gone from
short films
to two great seasons of webseries Going Our Way (Season 1
and Season 2)
and now we are hitting the big time, C31. That's right, we're getting on TV.  


But we need your help to do it! 
Creator and Executive Producer Fiona Bulle is an award-winning feature film producer. She produced the film ""41"" and its director, Glenn Triggs, is shooting the pilot episode of Sonnigsburg.  




WHERE THE MONEY GOES


We will be updating you as we go as to where and on what we use the funds, including what we are up to in the filming process.


Specifically, we need your help to secure locations, make-up, fuel, equipment-hire, props, costumes and, most importantly of all... food!


But really, when it comes down to it ....you'll be helping us make sure that when this goes on TV in 2015, it looks, sounds and feels great! Your donations will help that.
NB:  The cast and crew are all doing this for free. All the hard work we are putting in is for us to gain valuable experience - and from the goodness of our hearts. Believe us when we say it's hard work because it really is, but it's also oh-so-much fun and extremely rewarding. But while we are working for nothing, some things still cost money.Photo: Petra Elliott as Jade - episode 1, Sonnigsburg

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! We are Darci Nalepa and Jessie Fisher.  We are local actors in Chicago.  This campaign is exciting and important to us because of the light we see ignited in our fellow female artists' eyes when we have pitched it.  We have gathered a diverse and extremely talented group of women for both on and off camera to help make this funny and unique comedy a reality. </p>
<p>Our cast includes:</p>
<p>Jessie Fisher (<i>Once, </i>upcoming <i>Harry Potter and the Cursed Child</i> on Broadway)</p>
<p>Darci Nalepa ( Stephen Cone's <i>Henry Gambles Birthday Party)</i></p>
<p>Sadieh Rifai (<i>The Patriot</i> on Amazon Prime)</p>
<p>Kristina Valada-Viars (Off Broadway, Steppenwolf)</p>
<p>Emjoy Gavino (creator of the Inclusion Project)</p>
<p>Cruz Gonzalez (<i>Lela and Co.</i> at Steep Theatre, <i>The Chi)</i></p>
<p>Sasha Smith (<i>Chicago PD)</i></p>
<p>Plus other talented, local actors</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u>But we need your help for the final step of this project.</u></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>It is important to us to not only feature the work of the artists in this community, but to compensate them as well.  Often, we are asked to volunteer our time for the <i>possibility</i> of recognition.  The validation of compensation means something.  It says ""your art means something, your time and energy are valuable"".   But giving that validation requires some support.  Besides paying our artists, your contribution will cover all production fees.  This includes permits, props, costumes, union fees, post production editing and sound...the list continues to grow.   But we are excited to attack this challenge with professionalism and hopefully, your support!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution would mean you stand with us when we say the voices of diverse women in the arts world are of value.   Does this world need more actors?  Maybe not.  But by donating to our project, you are saying the world needs more artists and leaders.  We may be making a comedic series here, but we are showcasing women as leaders on all fronts.  Any opportunity to demonstrate that in our world matters and you could be one of those leaders right now!</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand not everyone can contribute to this project with financial support, but there are other ways you can help!  If you are interested in donating a meal, please contact us at ladycops17@gmail.com.  Also, please pass this site on to friends and family who you think would be excited about supporting this project!</p>

<h3>The Breakdown</h3>
<p>Here's the deal. We've got the stories, and we're writing as many as we can. We just need enough money to take a break from our day jobs to film each episode. So here's what goes into each episode:</p>
<p>Equipment - $100 (We have most of it, but we'll need a few lights and sound equipment.)</p>
<p>Food - $250 (Survival purposes.)</p>
<p>Locations/Permits - $0 for the next episode, (but we may need some for future episodes.)</p>
<p>Actors - $500 (They gotta be convincing!)</p>
<p>Costumes/Props: $250 (Two new characters for the next one!)</p>
<p>Makeup: $100 (Because what's D&amp;D if everyone is human?)</p>
<p>Crew: $600 (So they can afford to take the days off.)</p>
<p>Total: $1,800</p>
<p>So, we've set our goal for $2,000. If we do raise above the $1,800, it will go towards greater special effects, better costumes, etc. If we don't quite make the goal, the good news is we can still make it! But those same things will have to be reduced in quality. We want to make the best product we can, and we could not do it without your help, so we've come up with a bunch of cool thank yous if you donate. If you give $5, we'll shout you out because you're awesome! If you give $50, you'll get a signed character sheet from your favorite character! If you give $200, you get a free dice bag! And there are more gifts for all the donations in between. Anything helps!</p>
</div><div> </div><div>
<h3>What Perils Lie Ahead?</h3>
<p>We want to make one of these a month. For the resources required, that's ambitious, but we believe we can make it happen. If we have to skip a month, we will, but we'd like to not have to. IF that is the case, we'll be sure to keep you updated every step of the way. </p>
<p>The budget is somewhat flexible, so we can adjust our production to a certain degree. Our team has experience on a multitude of project types and know how much problem solving is a part of the job description. If there's a way to make the next episode, we will find it. We will make it. And it'll be glorious.</p>

<h3>Roll Initiative!</h3>
<p>We want to build a community around this project and what we do. If you like our content, want to share this campaign, put us on your Christmas wishlist, anything and everything helps!</p>
<p>We also understand if you're a bit short on gold or silver pieces, but you can help in other ways! Share us on social media. Tell your friends. Tell your enemies. Hell, even tell that weird guy that you sometimes play D&amp;D with.</p>

I remember looking at the friend and telling her this could be a show! Only 6 years later its finally happening . With you help we can market the series and pay those who put time aside to create this show.</p><p> </p><p><b>THE STORY OF SPELLBOUND</b></p><p>Spellbound, will put teens in real danger with real consequences with a splash of magic and the supernatural.</p><p>    Set in the town of Clifton, Spellbound follows Four  teens as they try to uncover the truth about themselves and their past.</p><p>    With this web-series the idea is to take a cinematic approach. By the end of each season the viewer will have a feature film to watch. Each character no matter how small has a large purpose in the series.</p><p>    This is a character driven show with an equal serving of emotion and action. The Core four group are Witches and Warlocks. With that said more supernatural beings will be making appearances in the show.</p><p><strong>THE TEENS </strong></p><p>MAXX -sixteen, Maxx is  the youngest in the core group, but he doesn't show it. He is a definite nerd, he spends most of his time in button ups and khakis. He can tell you the radius of Jupiter, but he can't have any kind of normal conversation with anyone other than his friends. He is the leader of the core group of friends. Maxx is very powerful, sadly he doesn't know it. He practices Red Chaos Magic. This magic is even harder to control then Black Magic. He is always unsure of himself until he realizes how to use his magic.</p><p> </p><p>ORA -seventeen, Ora is the most mature of the group, she wears black and has a gothic look. She has great one-liners and has a monotone voice. Ora practices Black Magic and has trouble controlling it. Ora becomes friends with Maxx in Preschool. They find out that they both practice magic in elementary,where they meet Danny. She has Maxx’s safety as her top priority at all times. </p><p> </p><p>DANNY-eighteen , Danny is the oldest of the group and the most immature. He wears anything flashy. He practices Yellow Magic. For his powers to work he needs to cypher from something or someone else. He is also cared for by his mother after his father dies. His mother is very protective of Danny, due to the way his father died. His dad was overwhelmed by his powers. Danny practices the same magic as his dad. This scares his mother so she tries to keep him close to her as much as possible.</p><p> </p><p>Avasa -eighteen, Avasa is the half older brother of Maxx. He has a necklace that he can’t take off.  Given to him as a child by his father to protect him. He wears edgy clothes with eyeliner. He practices White Magic. This allows him to persuade anyone to do anything. In Avasa’s younger years he was abused by his foster parents. Due to this he doesn't let people get close to him and has a hard time trusting people. </p><p> </p><p>Harris Grey, eighteen, Harris works for his father. He will do anything to make him happy. So when Ora does a spell on him he recognizes it as magic and with his father's help goes after her and her friends. After a while he sees that his father is the problem. So he goes against him and joins the core group.</p><p> </p><p><strong>THE ADULTS</strong></p><p>The adults in this show will not be the center of the show, but they will be very present.</p><p> </p><p>Lisa, late 30’s - Lisa is the main caretaker for Maxx. She practices Green Magic. She takes her job of keeping Maxx very seriously. Lisa grew up in Clifton; she’s never left. She works at the local grocery store. Lisa is a witch, but only uses her magic when she must.</p><p> </p><p>ROSE, early 30’s- Rose  “Woman In Red” is Lisa’s younger sister and Maxx’s mother. She practices Red Chaos Magic; her powers are usually too much for her. Rose wants to be a good person but she battles with herself. On the night Maxx was born she killed Roman’s wife and Avasa’s mother. This sends Roman into a rage, he decides to lock her away. He goes with her to insure she never leaves. While she is in the Contemporaneous she only gets angrier. She plots her revenge for when she gets free. When Maxx makes his way to her, she sees a way out.</p><p><br/>Roman Krell , early 30’s - Roman was the head of the covenant. Roman can practice all magic, this makes him the most powerful warlock. He has an affair with Rose. When she becomes pregnant with Avasa he tries to get her to reverse it. Instead she hides the child from him. After finding out he doesn't love her and won't leave his family Rose loses her mind. He uses his magic to create an amulet to protect his son Avasa. After, he locks himself and Rose into the contemporaneous.</p><p> </p><p>WISTERIA VICE,early 40’s - Wisteria practices Green Magic, she was Romans’s closest friend and after his disappearance she took over. She was good friends with Lisa and Rose and after finding out Rose is in the Contemporaneous she agrees to help Lisa get her out.</p><p> </p><p>RICHARD GREY,  late, thirties - Richard (Mr.Grey)is Harris’s father . He works a secret organization that hunts witches.  After his son  runs into a witch (Ora) in school he helps him track down her and her friends.</p><p> </p><p><strong>THE TWISTED TWINS</strong></p><p>The Twisted Twins are the children of Wisteria, they are both powerful on their own but unstoppable together. The two get their name due to them always being together and odd things happening around them. They are known to be very mischievous. </p><p> </p><p>Victoria Vice- seventeen, Victoria is a natural beauty, she practices Purple Magic. This allows her to control time and move through time when she wants. She can rip holes in time and space for a short period of time. Victoria is her brother's keeper. She always wants him to be calm to keep others safe. She is very close to her mother as well as a perfectionist. She becomes very close to Avasa and tries to figure him out. This makes her Brother a little jealous.</p><p> </p><p>Victor Vice-seventeen, Victor is a very odd teen, he doesn’t like to talk to anyone other than his sister. He can control dark matter, death and is a telepath. He loves his sister and will do anything for her. She is the only one that can calm him down. He doesn’t like to share her and when he can he keeps her close. Victor’s abilities can be too much for him at times.</p><p> </p><p><strong>SPELLBOUND IN THE FUTURE </strong></p><p>Spellbound is meant and designed to last for generations, with enough story to last far longer than five seasons. The hypothetical seasons will follow the same teens as they find out more about themselves and their past as well as their future. Rose and Avasa would be anti-heros for the season; they join forces when they must, if they don't fight each other first. With Roman he will be coming as a man out of time. Each season would pose a new villain and problem for the teens to overcome. The seasons would run as a sequel,with it being one year later. Each season finale will end with a cliffhanger. Each character has the potential to have their own fan base just as the show does.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p></div>","MAXXIn high school my friend and I wrote a short story called ""Maxx""that would send my school into a frenzy.

He is always unsure of himself until he realizes how to use his magic. ORA -seventeen, Ora is the most mature of the group, she wears black and has a gothic look. She has great one-liners and has a monotone voice. Ora practices Black Magic and has trouble controlling it. Ora becomes friends with Maxx in Preschool.

For his powers to work he needs to cypher from something or someone else. He is also cared for by his mother after his father dies. His mother is very protective of Danny, due to the way his father died. His dad was overwhelmed by his powers. Danny practices the same magic as his dad. This scares his mother so she tries to keep him close to her as much as possible. Avasa -eighteen, Avasa is the half older brother of Maxx. He has a necklace that he can’t take off.  Given to him as a child by his father to protect him. He wears edgy clothes with eyeliner. He practices White Magic. This allows him to persuade anyone to do anything. In Avasa’s younger years he was abused by his foster parents. Due to this he doesn't let people get close to him and has a hard time trusting people.  Harris Grey, eighteen, Harris works for his father. He will do anything to make him happy. So when Ora does a spell on him he recognizes it as magic and with his father's help goes after her and her friends. After a while he sees that his father is the problem. So he goes against him and joins the core group. THE ADULTSThe adults in this show will not be the center of the show, but they will be very present. Lisa, late 30’s - Lisa is the main caretaker for Maxx. She practices Green Magic. She takes her job of keeping Maxx very seriously. Lisa grew up in Clifton; she’s never left. She works at the local grocery store. Lisa is a witch, but only uses her magic when she must. ROSE, early 30’s- Rose  “Woman In Red” is Lisa’s younger sister and Maxx’s mother. She practices Red Chaos Magic; her powers are usually too much for her. Rose wants to be a good person but she battles with herself. On the night Maxx was born she killed Roman’s wife and Avasa’s mother. This sends Roman into a rage, he decides to lock her away. He goes with her to insure she never leaves. While she is in the Contemporaneous she only gets angrier. She plots her revenge for when she gets free. When Maxx makes his way to her, she sees a way out.Roman Krell , early 30’s - Roman was the head of the covenant. Roman can practice all magic, this makes him the most powerful warlock. He has an affair with Rose. When she becomes pregnant with Avasa he tries to get her to reverse it. Instead she hides the child from him. After finding out he doesn't love her and won't leave his family Rose loses her mind. He uses his magic to create an amulet to protect his son Avasa. After, he locks himself and Rose into the contemporaneous. WISTERIA VICE,early 40’s - Wisteria practices Green Magic, she was Romans’s closest friend and after his disappearance she took over. She was good friends with Lisa and Rose and after finding out Rose is in the Contemporaneous she agrees to help Lisa get her out. RICHARD GREY,  late, thirties - Richard (Mr.Grey)is Harris’s father . He works a secret organization that hunts witches.  After his son  runs into a witch (Ora) in school he helps him track down her and her friends. THE TWISTED TWINSThe Twisted Twins are the children of Wisteria, they are both powerful on their own but unstoppable together. The two get their name due to them always being together and odd things happening around them. They are known to be very mischievous.  Victoria Vice- seventeen, Victoria is a natural beauty, she practices Purple Magic. This allows her to control time and move through time when she wants. She can rip holes in time and space for a short period of time. Victoria is her brother's keeper. She always wants him to be calm to keep others safe. She is very close to her mother as well as a perfectionist. She becomes very close to Avasa and tries to figure him out. This makes her Brother a little jealous. Victor Vice-seventeen, Victor is a very odd teen, he doesn’t like to talk to anyone other than his sister. He can control dark matter, death and is a telepath. He loves his sister and will do anything for her. She is the only one that can calm him down. He doesn’t like to share her and when he can he keeps her close. Victor’s abilities can be too much for him at times. SPELLBOUND IN THE FUTURE Spellbound is meant and designed to last for generations, with enough story to last far longer than five seasons. The hypothetical seasons will follow the same teens as they find out more about themselves and their past as well as their future. Rose and Avasa would be anti-heros for the season; they join forces when they must, if they don't fight each other first. With Roman he will be coming as a man out of time. Each season would pose a new villain and problem for the teens to overcome. The seasons would run as a sequel,with it being one year later. Each season finale will end with a cliffhanger. Each character has the potential to have their own fan base just as the show does.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

According to Wikipedia, ""Cathy's characteristics and issues made fun and fed into negative stereotypes about women. ""Season 1 accumulated over 10,000 views on YouTube and was an official selection of several prestigious film festivals including Dances With Films, CineFest, IFS, and LA Comedy Fest.       WHAT is the plot?After 34 years in the Sunday Funnies, Cathy was canceled! Ack! Now that she's updated her image she's ready to take on the world of on-screen acting! She's hired a documentary crew to follow her around and film her journey trying to crACK Hollywood. Why? Well, it worked for Lisa Kudrow on the Comeback! We'll follow Cathy with guest star roles on parodies of your favorite TV shows, from the BACKhelor to BlACK  Mirror. It's going to be ACKciting!WHY is this important?Are you tired of media that makes you feel bad about yourself? I can't read a magazine or watch a movie without  feeling ugly. If you're like me, you want entertainment that leaves you feeling better about yourself.  This is why we need Cathy! In comparison, she will make anyone feel better about themselves.Also, there is an unfair representation of women in the Entertainment Industry.  The number of women working in film remains low, and the only solution  is to keep creating content by women and starring women.  The more people see women protagonists, the more they can re-train themselves to relate to women. This series is important because it creates roles for women. The cast is almost all female.  Also, this series explores the changing definition of feminism and the different opinions as to what should and shouldn't be considered funny and does it in a very fun, non-threatening manner. WHAT WE NEED!We finished shooting but need funds for editing and festival fees! For every $300 we raise we can edit 1 episode. We have 10 episodes to edit. So we need to at least raise an additional $3,000WHO are we?Susan Sassi - Creator/Producer/Cathy IRLSusan Sassi has been independently writing and producing for close to 8 years. Her musical, Victorian Courting and Zombies, ran at the 2014 Hollywood Fringe Festival where it enjoyed a sold-out run and was given a shout out on NPR and Lemon Lounge.  Some of her previous projects includes Cathy IRL Season One, Private Midnight, Lost Love Scenes, and Previous Tenants.

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Idea</span></h3>
<p>Each episode of the series will center on one of the following characters:</p>
<p><strong>Kyle: </strong>A centaur with the top half of a human and bottom half of a human (the horse is a recessive gene), struggling with imposter syndrome amongst the other mythics. </p>
<p><strong>Roger</strong><strong>: </strong> A wizard trying to find a community. </p>
<p><strong>X: </strong>A body-jumping spirit trying to find a sense of identity. </p>
<p><b>Brad: </b>A buff fairy dealing with with anxiety around his physical appearance. </p>
<p>and <strong>Kate: </strong>A vampire struggling to overcome addiction. </p>
<p>As they tell their story to the group, get advice, and go back out into the world. While the meetings will be a framing device, the majority of each episode will be spent with the characters as they navigate their problems. </p>
<p>Each episode will adopt a style consistent with the themes of the episode, including noir, romance, and comedy. Overall stylistic influences include the implementation of mythical metaphors for human problems as seen in <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>, as well as the naturalistic, character driven sensibilities of indie film and TV. </p>
<h3><strong>Who We Are</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Max Rosenblum (writer/co-director) </strong>has written/directed/produced over a dozen short films since freshman year of highschool - many of which have been selected for the All American Highschool Film Festival and won Scholastic Art and Writing awards. He's currently a freshman at NYU Tisch, majoring in dramatic writing. </p>
<p><strong>Cameron Paradiso (co-director)  </strong>Has written/directed/produced a number of shorts since his freshman year of highschool.  He worked as the head of his school's school broadcast show. Worked for companies like Colgate, Amazon, Volkswagen, and Chicken Soup for the Soul on promotional material. Currently a Freshman at Tisch, Majoring in Film and Televison Production.</p>
<p><strong>Sebastian Zufelt (producer) </strong>is a filmmaker from Seattle, Washington. After attending his high school’s digital filmmaking academy, he is now a student at NYU Film School (Class of 2024.) He has written/directed/produced films which have screened at film festivals across the country.</p>
<p>The rest of the cast and crew are composed entirely of students at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts for film, drama, or dramatic writing. </p>
</div><div>
<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Where the Money's Going</span></h3>
<p>We are working hard to make this project as cheaply as possible, whether that means cobbling together production gear from our personal collections, asking actors to provide costumes, or begging friends and local organizations for shooting locations.</p>
<p>That being said, film production is always expensive. Costs will include :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Transportation and food</strong> </li>
<li><strong>Hair and makeup</strong></li>
<li><b>Costuming</b></li>
<li><b>Gear rentals</b></li>
<li><b>Location rentals</b></li>
</ul>
<p>Any amount you could give would go a long way towards making making this idea a reality. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We are starting production on this project in the midst of the pandemic, complying with the <a href=""https://www.dga.org/-/media/Files/TheGuild/Coronavirus-Resources/ReturnToWork_FullAgreement.ashx"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">DGA guidelines for on-set COVID safety. </a> Additionally, we've written our scripts to be easily filmed while complying with restrictions. While the pandemic poses some significant challenges, we are confident in our ability to complete the project. </p>

Overall stylistic influences include the implementation of mythical metaphors for human problems as seen in Buffy the Vampire Slayer, as well as the naturalistic, character driven sensibilities of indie film and TV. 
Who We Are

The rest of the cast and crew are composed entirely of students at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts for film, drama, or dramatic writing. 

Where the Money's Going
We are working hard to make this project as cheaply as possible, whether that means cobbling together production gear from our personal collections, asking actors to provide costumes, or begging friends and local organizations for shooting locations.
That being said, film production is always expensive. Costs will include :


Transportation and food 
Hair and makeup
Costuming
Gear rentals
Location rentals

Any amount you could give would go a long way towards making making this idea a reality. 

Risks & Challenges
We are starting production on this project in the midst of the pandemic, complying with the DGA guidelines for on-set COVID safety.  Additionally, we've written our scripts to be easily filmed while complying with restrictions. While the pandemic poses some significant challenges, we are confident in our ability to complete the project.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Hi! We are Amanda Friedman and Kelsey Sullivan, creator and producer, respectively, of <i>Character House</i>.</p>
<p><i>Character House</i> is an adult animation episodic series about two childhood best friends, Daniel and Vika, who are now grown up, who, after a machine malfunction, move into a house with their created childhood Characters who have come to life. However, they are not what they dreamed as children and, because of the malfunction, the Characters have been corrupted by the adult world. These Characters include, but are not limited too, a lazy alcoholic dog/chameleon hybrid, an attention-seeking doll with a love for violence and sexual deviance, and a block-art dinosaur who shoots fire out of its block boob. With the assistance from a bizarre and stubborn billionaire, who hopes to profit off the Characters, they all work together to create an attraction called “The Character House."" And so, Vika and Daniel must learn to live among their creations and discover why nostalgia is best saved for the past.</p>
<p>This concept first came to me (Amanda) after revisiting some of my own childhood drawings. Seeing them, I felt nostalgic, but I also found it strange how weird/inappropriate/depressing the drawings were to me now.  This gave me the idea to develop a show that pokes fun at nostalgia and highlights how things from our childhood change when they are viewed through the lens of an adult.</p>
<p>After developing a pilot in the summer of 2020, we are now looking to create a 5 minute proof of concept that is representative of the show. But to do that we need to gather the resources necessary to present this concept in a way it deserves to be shown. So now, we are looking to YOU to help us make this a reality. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>We are planning to have three campaigns over the course of this production: pre production, production itself, and post production.</p>
<p>This campaign is strictly for the preproduction process. This includes hiring a character designer, set designer, storyboard artist, and editor. We are looking to raise $600 to pay our preproduction team for their hard work.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will help make this proof of concept a reality. This money will set the stage for us to share this idea with the world, first with the proof of concept, and later on (hopefully) a full pilot. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Because this is an ongoing campaign, your funds may be used at some point in one way or another towards the project. </p>
<p>We already have our pre production team assembled and committed. Now it's about funding this first step. </p>
<p>What's nice about animation is that it can be done remotely, and therefore we will not be restricted or shut down due to COVID-19. </p>
<p>However, we aim to be transparent, so if any problems arise in the future, we will keep you updated.</p>

<h3>The Sinza Project</h3>
<p>Thank you, Friends, for landing on our page. Without the encouragement and support from many of you over the years, we would not be where we are today.</p>
<p>We are the Sinza Team: a team of young entrepreneurs, animators, nutritionists, and public health professionals, working hard to empower the vision of a healthy and knowledgeable community.</p>
<p>“Prevention is better than treatment.” If this statement holds true, then the biggest challenge concerning health today is an information gap. Uganda has an abundance of local nutritious foods. Yet families still suffer from poor feeding and malnutrition, infectious diseases, and a general lack of fitness.</p>
<p>Over the past 4 years, we have worked hard to produce a nutrition education video to show in communities &amp; schools around Kampala, Uganda. The showings have developed into Sinza Clubs where school-age students and groups in underprivileged communities are receiving ongoing practical training by nutrition students from university programs in Kampala.</p>
<p><b>We tell stories through animation for community health education in Uganda.</b></p>
<p>Through animation, the videos we produce offer a visual context for health education that dive deeper into why healthy behavioral choices are vital. Through stories, educational information is presented in a relevant, cultural context that engages the community's attention. Our characters mirror the lives of their audiences to model behavior around situations with which they can identify.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1557883507/ino2gjt708dtlay6rcxn.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>Here, Jajja (Grandma) is teaching Sinza how to catch flying ants which are an important source of protein and are a low-cost food source in the Ugandan diet. - A shot from our next video which is still in slow production.</i></p>
<p><strong>Why Did We Choose To Start With Nutrition Education?</strong></p>
<p>Nutrition status in Uganda</p>
<p>Malnutrition is associated with 47%of child deaths in Uganda and almost quarter of all maternal deaths. The consequences of malnutrition, such as impaired mental development, affect school performance and reduce Uganda’s ability to educate the next generation, contributing to low school completion rates.</p>
<p>The causes of malnutrition in Uganda are manifold: Repeated infections (including acute respiratory infections, diarrhea, and malaria) and suboptimal breastfeeding and Infant and Young Child Feeding practices that result in inadequate dietary intake are immediate causes of malnutrition.  The underlying causes of malnutrition include lack of safe water, poor hygiene and sanitation; food insecurity; high fertility; gender inequality; and poverty. M<span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">alnutrition in Uganda is a complex problem that persists due to multiple causes rooted in various sectors. This therefore, in addition to nutrition specific interventions, multi-sectoral nutrition-sensitive interventions are also essential to reduce and eradicate malnutrition in Uganda.</span></p>

<p><strong>More About Us</strong></p>
<p>The Sinza Project is a social enterprise. We aim to impact preventative healthcare transformation in underserved populations by capturing health education into simple, interactive, visual formats that can be easily understood by the common or uneducated individual. </p>
<p>In Uganda, there is a lack of access to information and educational resources. We have created a fictional, animated, Ugandan girl-child named Sinza who teaches her community how to maintain a better quality of life. All of our education materials center around the Sinza character.</p>
<p>Talented, young Ugandan animators and character artists gather together to produce the story and visual content that are the Sinza videos. Scripts are written by university student groups brought together from departments specializing in health related research. Together, they create culturally relevant stories that are interwoven with educational information for preventative healthy behavior. Throughout the process, faculty and community health professionals are involved in reviewing the content to insure that our curriculum is meeting professional standards. Voice actors bring the characters to life for the animation videos.</p>
<p>Our videos become available to the community in a variety of languages for personal purchase, for use in outreach programs, school curriculum, or for tv licensing, making Sinza videos accessible to as many people as possible.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>Education</strong></i></p>
<p>The Sinza Project produces educational animation videos to address the major health and social concerns facing families in East Africa today. The animation video series will provide communities with relevant and easy to understand health education. We hope to accomplish this by providing each video in as many languages as possible so that communities can learn in their most familiar language.</p>
<p>Sinza will educate the community from principles of reasoned action, effective behavior modeling, and self-efficacy with the intention of influencing common attitudes already established regarding health concerns, preventative care actions, and resources.</p>
<p>We will measure the success of this goal by how many organizations are using the Sinza videos as their tool for education and by monitoring behavioral change within a community group through regular assessments.</p>
<p><i><strong>Innovation</strong></i></p>
<p>The Sinza Project will create opportunities for university students to engage with their community by contributing up-to-date research on preventative health behavior.</p>
<p>Primary schools and secondary schools can engage in serving their communities as well by designing unique projects that promote healthy living in their communities based on what they are learning from the Sinza videos.</p>
<p><i><strong>Local Resources</strong></i></p>
<p>The Sinza Project promotes healthy living based on locally available resources. It addresses the question of how a community can maintain a healthy quality of life based on materials that are locally available, indigenous, and/or easily accessible.</p>
<p><i><strong>Economic Sustainability</strong></i></p>
<p>In order to create a more sustainable solution for existing community needs, The Sinza Project is structured as a business model. The health education tools produced are marketed for sale to generate income that supports continued administration and production costs of the company. Employees are recruited from the Ugandan national community.</p>
<p>Animation videos are created by Ugandan illustrators and animators, collaborating together specifically for The Sinza Project.</p>
<p>The Sinza Clubs employ Ugandan students and consulting health professionals to conduct outreaches for health education through schools and community organizations.</p>
<p><i><strong>Generosity</strong></i></p>
<p>The Sinza Project utilizes collective action from the local level to effect change. Members of the local community are encouraged to contribute by taking active responsibility for their community’s growth.</p>
<p>At the start of our company, all participants have served on a voluntary basis. Initial start up costs have been generated by crowd-funding from members of the Ugandan community.</p>
<p>Community Reinvestment: As The Sinza Project generates income above supporting continued administrative and production costs, all profit is reinvested into community outreach programs promoting and empowering community well-being.</p>
<p><strong>Our Audience</strong></p>
<p>Families from different social groups, economic levels, and tribes in East Africa will benefit as we expand the variety of materials and languages offered. For now, we are focusing on nutrition topics which are vital for Uganda. </p>
<p>The project will benefit the Ugandan economy as we collaborate with local businesses for the whole production process.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>In everything, there are challenges and risks. We take challenges and failures as opportunities for innovation. Our team has been dedicated on a voluntary basis for 4 years- we have faced political turmoil in the country, economic instability, fluctuating team members, and a staggering lack of resources. These challenges have only helped to shape our characters and our content, and define the dedication of our team. As an example, our animation team has developed a mixed media 2D/3D concept specifically to lower costs because we realized we couldn't meet the cost of producing a completely 3D set.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need your help to feed our cast and crew, buy props, costumes, and makeup, and to cover the costs of miscellaneous production expenses like batteries and gaffer's tape. College students eat a lot, which is why food is our biggest expense. Since we're a supernatural drama, a lot of our other expenses involve practical effects, props and set pieces, and costumes – things that help us tell you a more engaging story. The rest of our budget is dedicated to covering any equipment costs that may arise.  Every dollar you donate helps our crew work harder and our show look better. </p>

<p>To thank you for donating to our project, we've put together some spook-tacular perks for every donation level, including exclusive digital content, posters and T-shirts, props, and the chance to be on the show! We're so grateful for your support and can't wait to share this show with you.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>By supporting this project, you're helping a team of young filmmakers create something truly special. Ithaca College Television is the oldest college television station in the nation, yet supernatural shows are few and far between in the network's history. As the genre experiences a resurgence thanks to show like <i>Stranger Things</i> and <i>Twin Peaks</i>, we're providing talented students with the opportunity to push creative boundaries. Your donation will have a tangible impact on the quality of our show, and allow us to focus on making the best possible end product for viewers like you. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Making a television show isn't easy, but we're working hard to mitigate the risks associated with this project. Here are some of our biggest challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Weather – If you've ever visited Ithaca, you'll know the weather can be finnicky. While we intend to shoot several scenes outdoors, we also have backup indoor locations that make sense for the story we're telling.</li>
<li>Effects – We intend to use practical special effects to visualize the ghost in the show. The use of these effects will be carefully rehearsed, minimizing costs and logistical issues.</li>
<li>Scheduling – College students are busy, but we intend to follow our well-planned production schedule to produce our show on time and on budget. We believe communication and trust are essential to the success of any team, and will continue to communicate clearly with all members of our cast and crew about any issues that may arise during the course of production.</li>

Our story takes place in Hathaway, Rhode Island, where William Williams, a beloved Hathaway University employee and paranormal investigator, has been mysteriously murdered. Freshman Jordan Greene has lived in Hathaway her entire life and grew up with Williams as her mentor. She vanishes in the wake of his disappearance, leading her friends Casey, Paige, and Kyle to fear the worst. As Jordan's friends search for her, decoding messages left by Williams' ghost along the way, they uncover a larger conspiracy that holds the truth about Jordan's disappearance. 
The show will consist of six 15-minute episodes and deal with themes of grief, friendship, and community. The Legend of South Hill will premiere on Ithaca College Television and ictv.org this December.

<p>Sucker has a trio of horror enthusiasts who are working to make their vision come alive! </p>
<p><i>Here's some more info on our Executive Producers:</i></p>
<p><strong>Daniella Baltazar, Technical EP</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564796036/qfiscbw0g8amvkudvrug.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Daniella is a filmmaker from Houston, Texas. In college, she is a member of the Honors Program, SGA, and Delta Kappa Alpha. In the past year, she received an EVVY for “The Haunted Hour,” a supernatural podcast, and received an EVVY nomination for “Emerson’s Finest.” Daniella’s passion and excitement for “Sucker” comes from a deep love for all things supernatural and creepy. She’s excited to co-produce this with Brett and Sharon, whose passion and excitement rivals her own.</p>
<p><strong>Brett Boon, Director/Logistics EP</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564796960/lovq9bgrip2e39qeiemq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Brett is a creator from New Jersey, who produces, directs and markets film and television. He received praise for his short film “Prom?”, which was recently featured on the “Love, Simon” DVD release. His last project “Drag Mother” was nominated for ""Outstanding Advertisement"" and won for “Outstanding Intermediate Film"" at the 38th Annual EVVY Awards. Through his work, Brett strives to create media that dares to challenge and inspire others to see a more inclusive future. He hopes to bring this element to the horror genre.</p>
<p><strong>Sharon Zhitnik, Writer/Creative EP</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1564796353/iepmbpjmzshw1jlseeiz.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>Sharon is a Russian-Jewish screenwriter who is eager to co-produce her first show. She recently just got back from the Screenwriters Program in Greece, where she finished writing her first feature, a zombie comedy. From an early age, she has always enjoyed watching supernatural films and is extremely excited to have the ability to create her own. When writing for “Sucker”, she kept in mind the importance of representation in media and hopes that anything she works on can bring about a positive message.</p>

<p><strong>Locations: </strong>Sucker uses a large number of locations throughout the city of Boston. We need permits and to pay location fees for spaces that will make our show feel as authentic as possible. The central location of the show, Dusk Nightclub, is something that we want to film at a local Boston nightclub during the day. We also plan on being economic and using spaces on campus to transform into certain locations as well.</p>
<p><strong>Special Effects/Visual Effects: </strong>We are so excited to be hiring a team of SFX makeup artists who will help us with the practical effects that our show has. Sucker needs to have fangs, blood, and wounds, which will be done through the talent of our makeup team. We really need tons of gallons of blood (fake blood) and with your donation (money, not blood), we can get to our desired amount! We also plan on hiring a team of VFX artists who will help us animate the social media elements to be seen onscreen.</p>

<p><i>We will need tons of fake blood!</i></p>
<p><strong>Transportation: </strong>For off-campus locations, our crew needs to be able to get there with our equipment safely. When we are not transporting via the T, we want to be able to pay for the Ubers that will help us move from location to location. </p>
<p><strong>Distribution: </strong>While developing Sucker, we took a deep dive into horror-centric film festivals and curated a list that we believe would be the best for our show. Film festival submission fees can be free for students at times, but can also go up to the $100 range, depending on the specific festival. By creating this show, we are expanding our portfolios for future employers and audiences and by having a sound distribution budget, we are able to expand our visibility.  </p>

<p>Though we know this show is going to be chaotically fun and wild, we do not want to leave out the more serious elements that at also at the core of our horror comedy.</p>
<p>Sucker focuses on Becca, a bisexual vampire who has been around for a century and ends up in a relationship with nightclub waitress, Portia. The serious part of this relationship is that we do not want these characters to only be defined by their sexuality. We want Sucker to be unapologetically queer. The horror genre is a territory that we think LGBTQ+ representation could use some improvement in. More often than not, queer characters are put to the sidelines or only characterized by their queerness. The Becca/Portia storyline brings positive representation front and center.</p>
<p>With Sucker, we are telling a femme fatale story in the #MeToo era. We want Becca's character to transcend sexist stereotypes of this archetype character by using her power to take down oppressive forces and creep behavior that plague many women today in the digital dating scene.</p>

<p>We are creating something that requires a lot of locations and special effects work, so being fully funded provides us with enhancing the level of production we can provide. Sucker also mostly takes place at night, so we want to ensure we are filming in safe locations with supervision when needed.</p>
<p>Our campaign is at a fixed goal, which means if we do not raise our goal, we do not receive any funding. We want to be able to use this campaign to secure the locations/effects we need, as well as connect with our supporters with exclusive Sucker perks. </p>

A few months later, tellofilms posted about their Pitch to Production contest, which specifically supports upcoming filmmakers and writers who want to make content for the lesbian community. Hillary entered the contest with an idea she had written down on the plane ride home from ClexaCon and it won! Christin Baker, CEO of tellofilms, mentored and worked with Hillary, and at ClexaCon 2018 Passage had a staged reading with actresses. Now we are ready to start production to bring you this fantasy genre series with a lesbian lead who is a mom and a veteran, a unique love story, and some surprising twists. Shannan Leigh Reeve Shannan is an actress, director, and editor living in Los Angeles.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>Currently I am a college senior at the New York Film Academy. Over the past year I have written and created the world for this pilot episode. This will be my thesis for my BFA degree, but I aim to continue making the series once I have graduated college in September. </li>
<li>This pilot is important because it touches on many themes such as gender, religion and science. </li>
<li>The campaign will give me the money to pay the crew and cast along with other costs such as food, transportation, costume and props. The money will help me from all production to post production aspects. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Why Now?</h3>
<p>    The technology for engineering a child is in the near future. Within the next 100 years scientists will be able to engineer/modify children to help with long term hereditary diseases. However, if you can change one aspect of a child's DNA you have the ability to change anything. The science behind this started to come up socially in 2015. </p>
<p>    The technology to create the perfect child will only be available to people who can pay a minimum of 50,000 dollars. This could be a future where the rich have perfect children, and the poor can only have natural born. This is an interesting topic to me because of how controversial this is. On one hand people want to explore the possibility of engineering a child while on the other it could be interfering with Gods plan.</p>
<h3>The World </h3>
<p>    The world is separated between the elite community and the poor. Elites have an unlimited food supply, access to amazing technology, while the poor work hard jobs and starve. You can only have an elite child if you have enough money to engineer them. However, it is next to impossible for families in the poor communities to save enough money to have their children engineered.  </p>
<p>    All children in this world will go to school with each other until 6th grade which is when they have to take an end of year test. If you pass you can continue on to the next grade and live within the society, but if you don't you are forced out. Because of the intellectual advantage engineered children have, by the time the kids reach High School most of the natural born children  are weeded out, except the occasional prodigy. This world will explore what it means to be a teenager growing up in a dystopian society.</p>
<h3>What We Need</h3>
</div><div>
<p><strong>$1,200: Cast &amp; Crew Expenses</strong> - We need to make our budget so we are able to pay our hard working cast and crew. This will also include the price of equipment.</p>

<p><strong>$150: Permits &amp; Truck Rental-</strong> In order to make this pilot a success we need to have the proper money to get a truck and film permit. In order to load the equipment to and from the location we will need to get a U Haul, the budget will help secure this rental.</p>
<p><strong>$75: Set Design &amp; Costume</strong> - We need to have four different costumes for the actors in the shoot. The characters in this pilot are wealthy and we will need the money to help that image come onto screen. </p>
<p><strong>$75: Food &amp; Beverage </strong>- We are getting lunch for all of our cast and crew which can add up. This money will go towards providing lunch and dinner for everyone on set. </p>

<h3>The Zombroz European Tour!</h3>
<p>We've been doing Zombroz for several years and want to take this podcast to the next level. The world of COD Zombies is based on some amazing places and we want to hit the road and bring those places to you. We want to make videos together inside the Hohenwerfen Castle where Der Eisendrache is set, record a video-podcast in front of the real life Fly Trap, visit Heligoland and see how it compares to its video game counterpart and much more.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Bringing the Zombies Storyline to life...</h3>
<p>We will be going on a tour of Europe and visiting several famous locations from Zombies such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paris Catacombs and Eiffel Tower (the original and lost Moon Concept)</li>
<li>Bar-le-Duc/Verdun (Origins)</li>
<li>Hohenwerfen Castle (Der Eisendrache)</li>
<li>Project Riese and The Fly Trap (Der Riese)</li>
<li>Wittenau Sanatorium (Verruckt)</li>
<li>Fernsehturm/Berlin Wall (Kino Der Toten)</li>
<li>Berlin (The Shadowed Throne)</li>
<li>Heligoland (The Darkest Shore)</li>
</ul>
<p>Along the way we would be filming vlogs, scripted videos, and of course recording podcast. All while telling you about the real life places and real life history that went on to inspire the Zombies Storyline we love. We will bring the world of Call of Duty Zombies to life like never before and see how famous maps like Der Eisendrache and Verruckt compare to their real life counter-parts.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Making this happen!</h3>
<p>Between flights, hotels, rental cars, gas, equipment, train tickets, food and various other expenses, this tour series will be very expensive to produce. We will be personally funding most of this trip, however any donations to the trip would be much appreciate and would go a long way in helping us make this series even better. This is not a vacation for us. We will be driving from location to location filming videos and recording podcast for you! With your help though, we can make this 10 times better.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What content can you expect?</h3>
<p>This series will be filmed in June of 2018. Most videos and podcast will be released in July of 2018. Special episodes of Zombroz will be recorded on each stop of the trip in which we share our experience from that location, compare it to its in-game version and (as always) talk zombies. John plans to remake his 'The Real Life' series and film episodes in each location. He will also be filming various vlogs and fun videos along the way. Reed will also be filming videos while on tour from various locations we visit. Depending on internet access we may even do live shows while on tour.</p>

<p>My name is Raven Smith, a 2020 graduate from Montclair State University with a BFA in Acting and minor in Communications. While acting is an absolute passion of mine, so is writing. Like all students, my last semester of school was interrupted by the pandemic and everything changed overnight. I struggled to find inspiration for myself in quarantine... like everyone, I wanted to be anywhere else. Still, I tried to find the humor in our situation, and the thought led to me writing a script about two roommates feeling stuck in their tiny apartment... in a big neighborhood... in a huge city. Sean and Liam's (and their neighbors' and friends') story is one most young adults can relate to - the moment you wake up and realize it's time to start making a name for yourself, even though you have no idea what you're doing. I want to bring the world the comedic relief we all need, as well as a story by a Black female writer with the help of my POC, LGBT+, and female classmates. With your help, I can make that dream a reality.  </p>
<p>In order to produce this webseries pilot, we'll need around $750. This money will allow us to: adhere to the current safety protocols regarding productions during COVID-19 (reimbursing our small cast and crew for testing, obtaining masks, hand sanitizer, wipes, disinfectant spray, and any extra items needed), pay our production team, rent out our set, and cover transportation costs. We plan on having the finished pilot ready for viewing this summer - anyone who contributes anything will be invited to a screening. The pilot will then be submitted to several webseries / pilot festivals in the latter half of next year. </p>
<p>Times are difficult for everyone right now, which is why we've looked at the most cost efficient ways to create this project and reach our goals. From looking within our own circle for a location to doubling up on specific set duties, we want to be able to produce a quality pilot for an audience while still doing our best to keep each other safe. If our goal isn't met, we will use the money we've received and make the best out of our situation.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone can contribute, and that is more than okay! Just being interested in my webseries is a gift to me. If ""The Neighborhood"" sounds like an intriguing sitcom to you, you can help us reach our goal by sharing the campaign page and spreading the word on social media!

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>A little information about this project:</p>
<p>The Powderpuff Gays is a short animated web series with a twist on a classic.</p>
<p>This project will give a look at what it would be like to have three gay leading characters in a animated series.</p>
<p>Any donation is greatly appreciated and will help in making this dream a reality.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>

<h3>OUR STORY</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>This is a story of how losing your children drives people to make a choice that<br/>effects more people than they realize. When two families witness the horrific deaths of their children, they would do anything to get them back. This opens pandora’s box. When given the choice, they jump at getting them back, as any parent would, but the consequences<br/>are not what was expected.</p>
<p>Margaret Murphy is the Writer/Director of The Choice series. She has been acting for 30 years and has studied under names such as Lynn Fleming, Sharon Acher, and Bill Howie. She is also equally passionate about writing and has spent the last 10 years writing The Choice with the help and support of her writing coach Peter DeAnello.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">""This story came from a dream my sister had about twenty years ago. My first thought was ‘This is a movie that needs to be written.' I, however, was not a writer at that time. I fell in love with writing years later, with the guidance of Peter DeAnello, in 2006 and always had my sister's dream in the back of my head. This story started out as a short, quickly turning into a full-length feature film. As I worked on it, Peter suggested that it should become a pilot for a mini-series. At first, I thought he was crazy, but as usual, he was correct. I finished the pilot in 2015, with a few rewrites since, but was ready to sell it. Yes, it took ten years to get there. Leah Maxell read it and immediately knew we needed to make it here. The cast grew quickly as well as the crew. This is such a unique story and can be entertaining for all ages. I’m incredibly excited about the future of this show.""</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>OUR GOAL</h3>
<p>Our goal of $5,000 will allow us to film a teaser. When you are trying to get your play produced, you have a table read. If you are trying to get your pilot produced you film a teaser. Most of the cast and crew are donating their time to make this happen because they believe so passionately in this project. Therefore, the funds we raise will go towards gear, travel expenses, locations, special effects as well as crafty for the cast and crew. We just need your help to rent a really cool camera.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>OUR IMPACT</h3>
<p>We are residents of Florida and we love it here. However, over the recent years the filming in Florida has slowed tremendously. We want to change that. We are aware that change won't happen over-night, but by showcasing the talent we have here, we hope to make strides in that direction.</p>

<p>Here at 8 Till Late Productions, we are comprised of a group of young and diverse student filmmakers who want to produce content that empower those whose narratives aren't commonly told within mainstream media. We aim to be culturally relevant and socially aware to our ever-changing world and media landscape. The story of Molly In Pieces hits close to home with the members of our team for this reason! </p>
<p>Molly In Pieces would be 8 Till Late's first major production. It is a mini web-series that would span 5 short episodes in length. The story is a coming of age dramedy that follows our lead character Molly, a Black-biracial teen who hits her ""quarter life crisis"" and is forced to define her sense of self through her two imagined personas, who each represent both sides of her racial identity (named ""Me"" and ""Myself""). </p>
<p>Our story takes place in Toronto, Canada and touches on the bigger question: When growing up in a country that prides itself on being a ""mosaic,"" at what point do your roots get lost in the bigger picture? Molly navigates what it feels like being a foreigner within her own culture on top of the<br/>added pressure of becoming an adult. </p>
<p><strong><i>FUN FACT:</i></strong> Our story is inspired by writer and creator, Desiree Green, a 3rd+ generation Guyanese-Canadian who grew up in a predominantly Canadian home. We are excited to announce that she herself will be playing the lead character Molly! We look forward to seeing her take on the role and really connect with the deeper parts of the story that she has conceptualized. </p>

<p>As student filmmakers and content creators, the funds we receive from IndieGogo would support us in ways we couldn't imagine doing on our own! On top of helping us fulfill our production goals from a financial perspective, your donation also supports a movement towards the creation of media that exemplifies what it means to be living within a diverse era of individuals and being able to provide stories for those who don't usually see themselves or their experiences represented on screen.

<p><strong>Locations:</strong> this includes securing our filming locations as well as funding for art direction (which includes props, set dressing and wardrobe).</p>
<p><strong>Unit Expenses:</strong> includes craft/food services during on-set shooting times, and overall transportation costs for our cast and crew members.</p>
<p><strong>Insurance:</strong> includes location based insurance as well as equipment rental insurance.</p>
<p><strong>Publicity:</strong> includes costs for our paid promotional outreach (online, social media) and other distribution/festival costs once we reach our post-production period!</p>

Facing the highs and lows, being able to laugh at yourself and using humour to make the best of the situations. In regards to character<strong>: Bee is trying to understand the world, Birdie is making the most of the world, Milkboy is unhappy with the state of the world, and Josh Max is trying to save the world. </strong>In the end, all four characters come together to find what they are truly capable of.</p><p><strong>The pilot episode mixes whimsical and memorable childhood nostalgia with snappy modern comedic dialogue</strong>. The show takes the everyday and makes it absurd, and is never afraid to be honest. Highlighting each characters flaws, Birdie and Bee compliment and clash which real life sister-creators Madison and Taylor know all about, as they can truly communicate, with only a look.</p><p>The heart of the story is extremely important. Even if we had the budget for all the fancy tricks in the world, we want a story that an audience will care about, after all the laughs are said and done. <strong>Yes, it is a comedy, but it is a show about life being real and punching you in the face with feelings</strong>. It is about two women’s unspoken codependency, accepting said flaws, and getting what you as an individual want out of life.</p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>WHAT A BUNCH OF CHARACTERS</strong></p><p>Learn more about the types of characters you’ll get to see in Birdie + Bee!</p><p><strong>BIRDIE</strong> – Birdie seeks perfection but is far from. She is charismatic, vain, and indulges everything 2017 has to offer including social media, diet trends, and craft beer. She gets what she wants and doesn’t care about guys or relationships, enjoying life without worrying about other’s opinions. Aside from her pointed sarcasm and attitude, people still flock to Birdie as she has some sort of power over them. Under the surface, she is extremely self-conscious. This comes out in her hard exterior, never letting anyone but Bee come too close to her.</p><p><strong>BEE</strong> – Sweet and hardworking Bee replaces swear words with fruit puns. She happily buzzes from task to task, but isn’t satisfied with where she’s at in life. She craves security and daydreams about the perfect prince charming and family to come home to. She has a hard time accepting 2017 for what it is and dreams of a simpler time. Bee judges herself a lot and is always second guessing, putting others before herself. She really is the best friend you could ask for, but has to learn what is truly so special about herself. Vices include binge eating, falling in love at first site, and impulse buying.</p><p><strong>JOSH MAX</strong> – Hollybloom’s prized superhero in his off duty downtime, out of the spandex suit. Although we don’t see him fight crime, fly, or save dangling girls from burning buildings, we will see him stoically order pizza with friends, pay bills, and stare out his window at the towering skyline. Keeping the town safe majorly cuts into his social and love life, as he balances protecting his true identity from local villains and more importantly: Birdie.</p><p><strong>MILKBOY</strong> – Milkboy’s effortlessly cool 50’s greaser style and speech drives Bee to drop things at the mere sight of him when he delivers milk to her work. He is loyal, old fashioned, passionate, and birds seem to appear every time he is near. There is something special and complex bubbling under the surface for Milkboy. Catch him at the local soda shop enjoying a chocolate malt or racing for pinks in Bumper Bender Valley.   </p><p><strong>EVIL WITCH</strong> – The master of all that is wrong in the word. Wicked, grim, and easily irritated. He rules over the desolate town of Weirdsville. Cursed with extreme jealousy, Evil Witch does everything he can to stop millennials from enjoying their youth. Whether it’s poisoning the old watering hole, raising housing market prices, or stealing your hair elastics, Evil Witch will give you depression one way or another. He constantly uses his ancient witchy magic to disguise himself as various youthful personas to get the unnecessary revenge he lives for.</p><p><strong>MR. CASELLI</strong> – A kind Italian man who isn't afraid to whack you with a wooden spoon if you disappoint him. Owner of Caselli's Deli and Florals, Mr. Caselli is Bee's boss who wants the best for her, without being afraid to tell it like it is. In a perfect world, everyone would work as hard he does. He'll never quite understand ""kids today.”</p><p> </p><p><strong>WHERE THE FUNDING WILL GO</strong></p><p>As mentioned in the video, we need the money to pay for crucial elements we find integral to the project. This includes:</p><p><strong>LOCATION</strong> – It is hard to recreate a deli, flower shop, and brunch bar in your basement suite, and we need to drive far to get the secluded meadow shot!</p><p><strong>EQUIPMENT RENTALS </strong>– We need something better than our iPhones! We are not the Duplass Brothers, yet. This includes a camera, lighting, and sound equipment.  </p><p><strong>SET DESIGN</strong> – This show is based around colour, texture, and quirky set pieces. We will be scourging through second-hand stores and our grandma’s garage, but need the show BURSTING with interesting things to look at (since the two lead actresses are not). </p><p><strong>PROPS</strong> – Along with the set, this show is PACKED with props. Bee’s cactus purse, Birdie’s Know-It-All books, and a hefty amount of potted plants.</p><p><strong>COSTUME</strong> – Every character (except the naked Lumberjack) needs to be fully clothed!</p><p><strong>CRAFT SERVICE </strong>– We do not want any hangry people on set, and when working for free, having a full stomach becomes very important. </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1503425487/zyhbvx5ayazpeam2zoll.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p style=""text-align: center;"">EQUIPMENT - 23%, LOCATION - 20%, SET DESIGN, COSTUME, PROPS - 29%, CRAFT, SERVICE - 8%, PERKS - 16%, TRAVEL - 4%</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">For a more detailed breakdown of the budget, email us at <a href=""mailto:birdieandbeetv@gmail.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">birdieandbeetv@gmail.com</a>!</p><p style=""text-align: center;"">Be sure to check out the cool perks you can get from donating! <strong>Get em’ while they’re hot!</strong></p><p> </p><p><strong>CHALLENGES WE FACE</strong></p><p>We need to create the beautiful and whimsical world of the show with a limited budget and time constraint. Birdie + Bee will be shot over four full time days, completing every scene within the allotted hours. Anyone who has tried to produce a show in Vancouver knows it’s a challenge itself in between making a living in the city, as no one on the team is getting paid – it’s our passion project! And a full time job itself. Each person on the team is committed to getting the project done, and is graciously volunteering their time.</p><p>On top of this, we are a DIY sort of team, and many props and set pieces will be made ourselves such as Evil Witch’s sparkling apples, signs that are flown in, the cactus dollhouse, and many more.</p><p>It has been months of prep in order to film!</p><p>Creating this show feels similar to creating a fringe style show in a black box theater. <strong>We need to make the world believable for an audience with whatever resources we can, capturing the magic on film with elements you would see on stage</strong>. Whether its props flying in on strings, an extremely fast costume change, or text messages written out on signs instead of being edited in post, we are thinking outside the conventions of what we normally see on film. <strong>This means longer takes with actors working harder to get choreographed one shots done</strong>. For example, instead of shooting a traditional montage with cuts, the actors will go through the motions of a first date to a divorce in one take.  Blending elements from both film and stage performance will add more quirk and magic, making memorable scenes.</p><p>We are going for long takes, symmetrical frames, flat and warm lighting, and have been describing the style as a ""messy Wes Anderson."" With as much colour coordination as we can get.</p><p>What’s positive about the obstacles we face is that they have <strong>pushed us to think outside the box in terms of using makeshift effects in place of special effects</strong>. This lead us to a show unique to the writers and production team when looking at style. Birdie + Bee subverts expectations, has a strong voice and self-aware social commentary.</p><p>We want to put the extra bit of money and work into the pilot to gain traction in order to make the next 5 episodes, which are just as fun and crazy as the first. We want the pilot to capture how we picture the show being done, so whoever jumps on board in the future gets a clear picture, along with hoping to get a fan base going who DEMANDS to see Birdie + Bee progress.</p><p> </p><p><strong>THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME</strong></p><p>The world of Birdie + Bee is vast, and developed from small sketches Madison and Taylor found funny to loveable, in depth characters with goose bump causing reveals throughout the first season, with enough material to write a second. We are confident our team can pull this show off, and any amount of financial security helps.</p><p>We don’t want to give away everything, but here’s some exciting things that will happen during the rest of the season: Birdie gets insta-famous due to of her larger than life eyebrows. Bee has secret a relative return from her past that she deathly afraid of. There will be a completely musical episode, and the finale episode will end with an explosive battle, changing each character’s lives.</p><p>Again, an endless thank you for showing interest in our campaign. We never thought we would be able to pull off something like this, and it is really a dream come true.</p><p>And if you’re not able to donate – no worries! We understand.

She is incredibly grateful for the opportunity to create with her sister, who formally terrorized her as a child. She studies acting and being a person at Langara’s Studio 58. Taylor soars at incorporating magical elements into Birdie + Bee, and is never shy of zany ideas or on the spot brilliance. She truly believes this is something people are going to want to watch, because she is the most positive thinker out there. Taylor has acted in local shorts and will be gracing the stage this upcoming fall.NATHAN MAYESPRODUCERWhen Nathan isn’t busy being a diligent producer, he spends his time reading comic books. And when he’s not reading comic books, he’s watching movies with characters based off comic books. And when he’s not doing that, he’s listening to podcasts, about comic books. In all seriousness, comic books. Nathan is true born Vancouver boy, he studies acting full time at Capilano University, and is excited to help bring Birdie and Bee’s adventures to the screen.IOAN SEBASTIAN TIRLUI PLAYING: JOSH MAXBorn and raised in Calgary, Alberta, he made the move to Vancouver to attend the Vancouver Film School as an Actor. Having graduated in 2015, he has since worked on several projects both industry and independent; his latest release being the Nickelodeon movie: Legends of the Hidden Temple.ANDREW LYNCHPLAYING: MILKBOYAndrew is an actor, comedian, and producer of the live show and podcast Geeks versus Nerds. He is a regular performer in the burlesque community performing with Geekenders for several years. He holds a BFA in acting from The University of British Columbia.BRAEDEN SAUCYPLAYING: EVIL WITCHBraeden is a Capilano University acting student hailing from Ladner B.C. When he’s not acting you will find him writing lists of all sorts, including his favourite movies, books he needs to read but never will, and what types of lists he should write next. Future credits include several oscar-worthy but totally robbed films that should have garnered a nomination, but just sadly didn’t cater to the old-white-male academy demographic. At least he hopes.DAVID HUDGINS PLAYING: MR. CASELLIDavid Hudgins is a founder of the internationally acclaimed Electric Company Theatre in Vancouver. Through over two decades with this innovative company he has won numerous Jessie Awards. David received his BA Honours in English Literature at McGill University and a PDP Diploma in Education from Simon Fraser University. He now teaches acting at Studio 58 and has directed nine shows there, including two Ovation-Award winning productions: Guys & Dolls (2007) and Spring Awakening (2012). The homegrown musical The Park (2010) which he directed and helped to dramaturge, garnered it five nominations. David tries to find time to write, too. His 5-year orchestral/ physical-theatre hybrid experiment odyssey called Flee, with composer Peggy Lee, found its legs at the Fox Cabaret with Electric Company and Studio 58 in 2016We are honoured to have these talented actors portray ongoing characters of Birdie + Bee! WHAT IS THE SHOW REALLY ABOUT?Our goal is a feel good show that makes you laugh and think, with pleasing visuals, giving the over the look of the show a story book feeling, as Birdie and Bee live in a pseudo fairy-tale land. Like Alice falling down the rabbit hole, Birdie + Bee lends itself to endless possibilities. They are two women in their twenties trying to make rent and figure out life, but also an Evil Witch regularly tries to capture them, 90% of the guys in town are lumberjacks, and woodland creatures help start the day.At is core, Birdie + Bee is about discovering your place in the world today. Facing the highs and lows, being able to laugh at yourself and using humour to make the best of the situations. In regards to character: Bee is trying to understand the world, Birdie is making the most of the world, Milkboy is unhappy with the state of the world, and Josh Max is trying to save the world. In the end, all four characters come together to find what they are truly capable of.The pilot episode mixes whimsical and memorable childhood nostalgia with snappy modern comedic dialogue. The show takes the everyday and makes it absurd, and is never afraid to be honest. Highlighting each characters flaws, Birdie and Bee compliment and clash which real life sister-creators Madison and Taylor know all about, as they can truly communicate, with only a look.The heart of the story is extremely important. Even if we had the budget for all the fancy tricks in the world, we want a story that an audience will care about, after all the laughs are said and done. Yes, it is a comedy, but it is a show about life being real and punching you in the face with feelings. It is about two women’s unspoken codependency, accepting said flaws, and getting what you as an individual want out of life.  WHAT A BUNCH OF CHARACTERSLearn more about the types of characters you’ll get to see in Birdie + Bee!BIRDIE – Birdie seeks perfection but is far from. She is charismatic, vain, and indulges everything 2017 has to offer including social media, diet trends, and craft beer. She gets what she wants and doesn’t care about guys or relationships, enjoying life without worrying about other’s opinions. Aside from her pointed sarcasm and attitude, people still flock to Birdie as she has some sort of power over them. Under the surface, she is extremely self-conscious. This comes out in her hard exterior, never letting anyone but Bee come too close to her.BEE – Sweet and hardworking Bee replaces swear words with fruit puns. She happily buzzes from task to task, but isn’t satisfied with where she’s at in life. She craves security and daydreams about the perfect prince charming and family to come home to. She has a hard time accepting 2017 for what it is and dreams of a simpler time. Bee judges herself a lot and is always second guessing, putting others before herself. She really is the best friend you could ask for, but has to learn what is truly so special about herself. Vices include binge eating, falling in love at first site, and impulse buying.JOSH MAX – Hollybloom’s prized superhero in his off duty downtime, out of the spandex suit. Although we don’t see him fight crime, fly, or save dangling girls from burning buildings, we will see him stoically order pizza with friends, pay bills, and stare out his window at the towering skyline. Keeping the town safe majorly cuts into his social and love life, as he balances protecting his true identity from local villains and more importantly: Birdie.MILKBOY – Milkboy’s effortlessly cool 50’s greaser style and speech drives Bee to drop things at the mere sight of him when he delivers milk to her work. He is loyal, old fashioned, passionate, and birds seem to appear every time he is near. There is something special and complex bubbling under the surface for Milkboy. Catch him at the local soda shop enjoying a chocolate malt or racing for pinks in Bumper Bender Valley.   EVIL WITCH – The master of all that is wrong in the word. Wicked, grim, and easily irritated. He rules over the desolate town of Weirdsville. Cursed with extreme jealousy, Evil Witch does everything he can to stop millennials from enjoying their youth. Whether it’s poisoning the old watering hole, raising housing market prices, or stealing your hair elastics, Evil Witch will give you depression one way or another. He constantly uses his ancient witchy magic to disguise himself as various youthful personas to get the unnecessary revenge he lives for.MR. CASELLI – A kind Italian man who isn't afraid to whack you with a wooden spoon if you disappoint him. Owner of Caselli's Deli and Florals, Mr. Caselli is Bee's boss who wants the best for her, without being afraid to tell it like it is. In a perfect world, everyone would work as hard he does. He'll never quite understand ""kids today.” WHERE THE FUNDING WILL GOAs mentioned in the video, we need the money to pay for crucial elements we find integral to the project. This includes:LOCATION – It is hard to recreate a deli, flower shop, and brunch bar in your basement suite, and we need to drive far to get the secluded meadow shot!EQUIPMENT RENTALS – We need something better than our iPhones! We are not the Duplass Brothers, yet. This includes a camera, lighting, and sound equipment.  SET DESIGN – This show is based around colour, texture, and quirky set pieces. We will be scourging through second-hand stores and our grandma’s garage, but need the show BURSTING with interesting things to look at (since the two lead actresses are not). PROPS – Along with the set, this show is PACKED with props. Bee’s cactus purse, Birdie’s Know-It-All books, and a hefty amount of potted plants.COSTUME – Every character (except the naked Lumberjack) needs to be fully clothed!CRAFT SERVICE – We do not want any hangry people on set, and when working for free, having a full stomach becomes very important. EQUIPMENT - 23%, LOCATION - 20%, SET DESIGN, COSTUME, PROPS - 29%, CRAFT, SERVICE - 8%, PERKS - 16%, TRAVEL - 4%For a more detailed breakdown of the budget, email us at birdieandbeetv@gmail.com!Be sure to check out the cool perks you can get from donating! Get em’ while they’re hot! CHALLENGES WE FACEWe need to create the beautiful and whimsical world of the show with a limited budget and time constraint. Birdie + Bee will be shot over four full time days, completing every scene within the allotted hours. Anyone who has tried to produce a show in Vancouver knows it’s a challenge itself in between making a living in the city, as no one on the team is getting paid – it’s our passion project! And a full time job itself. Each person on the team is committed to getting the project done, and is graciously volunteering their time.On top of this, we are a DIY sort of team, and many props and set pieces will be made ourselves such as Evil Witch’s sparkling apples, signs that are flown in, the cactus dollhouse, and many more.It has been months of prep in order to film!Creating this show feels similar to creating a fringe style show in a black box theater. We need to make the world believable for an audience with whatever resources we can, capturing the magic on film with elements you would see on stage. Whether its props flying in on strings, an extremely fast costume change, or text messages written out on signs instead of being edited in post, we are thinking outside the conventions of what we normally see on film. This means longer takes with actors working harder to get choreographed one shots done. For example, instead of shooting a traditional montage with cuts, the actors will go through the motions of a first date to a divorce in one take.  Blending elements from both film and stage performance will add more quirk and magic, making memorable scenes.We are going for long takes, symmetrical frames, flat and warm lighting, and have been describing the style as a ""messy Wes Anderson."" With as much colour coordination as we can get.What’s positive about the obstacles we face is that they have pushed us to think outside the box in terms of using makeshift effects in place of special effects. This lead us to a show unique to the writers and production team when looking at style. Birdie + Bee subverts expectations, has a strong voice and self-aware social commentary.We want to put the extra bit of money and work into the pilot to gain traction in order to make the next 5 episodes, which are just as fun and crazy as the first. We want the pilot to capture how we picture the show being done, so whoever jumps on board in the future gets a clear picture, along with hoping to get a fan base going who DEMANDS to see Birdie + Bee progress. THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIMEThe world of Birdie + Bee is vast, and developed from small sketches Madison and Taylor found funny to loveable, in depth characters with goose bump causing reveals throughout the first season, with enough material to write a second. We are confident our team can pull this show off, and any amount of financial security helps.We don’t want to give away everything, but here’s some exciting things that will happen during the rest of the season: Birdie gets insta-famous due to of her larger than life eyebrows. Bee has secret a relative return from her past that she deathly afraid of. There will be a completely musical episode, and the finale episode will end with an explosive battle, changing each character’s lives.Again, an endless thank you for showing interest in our campaign. We never thought we would be able to pull off something like this, and it is really a dream come true.And if you’re not able to donate – no worries! We understand. But if you have taken a liking and would like to see the project get made, share the campaign and give us a like on Facebook at:www.facebook.com/birdieandbeetv We truly appreciate every bit of support,Madison and Taylor Long, and the rest of the Birdie + Bee Team",8.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>What is C&amp;Rsenal?</h3>
<p>For most of you viewing this campaign, you already know who we are and what we do.  But just in case you've wandered in fresh: C&amp;Rsenal is a small organization centered on historical firearms.  Our flag project is Primer, which is winding it's way through the small arms of World War I in a series of long format video documentaries and demonstrations.</p>
<p>We dig deep into the research and present the clearest picture possible with the help of live fire, period images and videos, and animations to show the operation of these machines.  It's a laborious and expensive process and so we consume a healthy monthly budget. </p>
<p>Most of our funding has come from Patreon donations, but twice a year we try to produce some merchandise for our viewers to actually own a piece of the work we've been doing, and provide a boost to our special projects budget.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why does C&amp;Rsenal need this money?</h3>
<p>Right now our generous patrons have kicked in plenty, so why do we need a cash grab mid year?  Well we get into a rhythm with our funding and naturally, to make the best show, we tend to spend it to the penny on improvements or acquiring more research material, manufacturing obsolete cartridges, paying shipping and insurance on loaners, and local travel.</p>
<p>But for our overall mission of including as many of these guns on video as possible and ALL of the weapons of the war in our final book project, we'll need to make a number of trips.  These range from hitting major museum collections for photos to visiting machine gun collectors in their own states (dang federal laws) for filming.  Additionally, developing 1,000 rounds of an antique and long unused cartridge is pretty dang expensive.  </p>
<p>So when you buy your shirt you'll be contributing to our endeavor to be the first to bundle every single firearm of the war into one major virtual collection.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>OK, but what do I get?</h3>
<p>You get a shirt.  Pay money, get shirt.  I hope that much is clear!</p>
<p>The $20 price tag reflects a bulk order, so we will start production AFTER the 30 day campaign.  We can't spend money we don't have folks and they won't give it to us until the very end.  From there we order the necessary cotton shirts and begin the quality screen printing and shipments.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What about this color, that size, ladies shirts?</h3>
<p>Since this is a bulk order we need at least 25 of each color and size combo to even make an order, let alone take advantage of the cost savings we'd need to make the price work. To simplify, each shirt is offered in one color, as featured in the photos.  Ladies and XXL shirts are priced differently from the source and we doubt we'll meet demands regardless.  It's a bit much to factor into our projections, but we can start working on them once a more permanent shop is established after this campaign.</p>

For most of you viewing this campaign, you already know who we are and what we do.  But just in case you've wandered in fresh: C&Rsenal is a small organization centered on historical firearms.  Our flag project is Primer, which is winding it's way through the small arms of World War I in a series of long format video documentaries and demonstrations.
We dig deep into the research and present the clearest picture possible with the help of live fire, period images and videos, and animations to show the operation of these machines.  It's a laborious and expensive process and so we consume a healthy monthly budget. 
Most of our funding has come from Patreon donations, but twice a year we try to produce some merchandise for our viewers to actually own a piece of the work we've been doing, and provide a boost to our special projects budget.

Why does C&Rsenal need this money?
Right now our generous patrons have kicked in plenty, so why do we need a cash grab mid year?  Well we get into a rhythm with our funding and naturally, to make the best show, we tend to spend it to the penny on improvements or acquiring more research material, manufacturing obsolete cartridges, paying shipping and insurance on loaners, and local travel.
But for our overall mission of including as many of these guns on video as possible and ALL of the weapons of the war in our final book project, we'll need to make a number of trips.  These range from hitting major museum collections for photos to visiting machine gun collectors in their own states (dang federal laws) for filming.  Additionally, developing 1,000 rounds of an antique and long unused cartridge is pretty dang expensive.  
So when you buy your shirt you'll be contributing to our endeavor to be the first to bundle every single firearm of the war into one major virtual collection.
 
 
OK, but what do I get?
You get a shirt.  Pay money, get shirt.  I hope that much is clear!
The $20 price tag reflects a bulk order, so we will start production AFTER the 30 day campaign.  We can't spend money we don't have folks and they won't give it to us until the very end.  From there we order the necessary cotton shirts and begin the quality screen printing and shipments.
 

 
What about this color, that size, ladies shirts?
Since this is a bulk order we need at least 25 of each color and size combo to even make an order, let alone take advantage of the cost savings we'd need to make the price work. To simplify, each shirt is offered in one color, as featured in the photos.  Ladies and XXL shirts are priced differently from the source and we doubt we'll meet demands regardless.  It's a bit much to factor into our projections, but we can start working on them once a more permanent shop is established after this campaign.",2.0,0,"9 Campaigns

<p>Our small talented team of specialists came up with the animation series called “The Adventures of Lilly: The Bulgarian Alphabet” (suitable for children aged between 2 and 7 years).  Lilly is a little happy girl with blue hair and a big blue whale as her friend, and together they go on adventures!</p>
<p>Each episode pays special attention to one character of the Bulgarian alphabet, with a short story about Lilly and her friends. The episodes will teach kids important values such as being friendly, honest, and helpful. The colourful characters are positive and inquisitive, with upbeat music accompanying the action to foster a friendly learning environment. Included in the show is a section with a clay workshop which is designed to stimulate children to be creative in their games and crafts, use a variety of materials, encourage their creative thinking, and aid developmental skills (such as hand-eye coordination).</p>
<p>To create the episodes we use a combination of Puppet Theater, cut-out Claymation, pixilation (stop motion with real human and objects), and computer cut-out animation. We believe that these combinations will create an eye-catching, colourful and textural look for the show, sustaining interest and attention from the beginning, and will be interesting for parents as well!</p>
<p><strong>What we have done until now?</strong></p>
<p>The first episode (the letter A) is completely finished and ready to be seen. The video length is 4min and 31 sec. The main story is about a little lamb that got lost, and Lilly helps him find his mother.</p>

<p>The rest of the 29 stories have been scripted and storyboarded. The stories are written by a person with pedagogical education who has experience working with children. The stories are matched with the characteristics of the characters and the animation style.</p>

<p><strong>The beginning:</strong></p>

<p>The “Adventures of Lilly”</p>
<p>2013 was the beginning of the first animation movie for kids called “Adventures of Lilly” titled “The little turtle”. Lilly is the main character of the movie and until the year 2013, she was out for adventures. Below is the Youtube link of the video. Enjoy!</p>
<p> ******* <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSCevTToP58"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSCevTToP58</a> *******</p>
<p>The year 2014, the movie was nominated the best animation short movie in the international film festival “New Wave” in Sofia, Bulgaria. Shortly after that we received an invitation to participate with it in the international festival for educational animation for children “Mice” in Valencia, Spain and in Teheran, Iran.</p>
<p>A bit later the same year, the second episode of “Adventures of Lilly won the first prize for a debut short animation competition sponsored by the national film center (NFC) in Bulgaria. With the support of the producers from “Vetrogon-bg” studio the movie was successfully completed in March 2016.</p>

<p><strong>Why we are doing it?</strong></p>
<p>These two movies are made with two classical animation techniques: hand drawn animation on paper, and clay cut out (stop motion). This process is quite time consuming – but produces interesting creative results! Our new project needed some speed and ease in the development, and we decided to work with the Bulgarian alphabet as subject matter because after some research, our team found out that there are no well-developed suitable and aesthetically finished animation series for young children.</p>
<p>In 2017, the first book “The adventures of Lilly: The Turtle” was published; it’s educational and follows the story line of the very first movie.</p>
<p>So after all of this experience we decided to get out of our comfort zones, and create a project with social impact and meaning.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1506454404/rpqhc31eu0vhcdjrv8on.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Our mission/goal:</strong></p>
<p>Our mission is to teach the kids not only the Bulgarian alphabet, but also to bring them happiness and make their world colourful. We want to encourage children to know that all that matters is to be good and do good, and all it takes is to have good friends and a smile on your face.</p>
<p><strong>Budget:</strong></p>
<p>The first episode about the letter A is just the beginning of our adventure. To reach the end we need you and your support. Till now the whole team are working completely voluntarily. Each one of us has given part of our free time so that the project could move forward.</p>
<p><strong>By contributing to the project, you will be funding the following:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><i>Paying the Cast &amp; Crew:</i></strong> it's very important for us to be able to compensate everyone who is dedicating time and energy to the making of the ""Adventures of Lilly: The Bulgarian Alphabet"" - we do not believe in the ""expenses only"" approach. To be able to do the rest of the 29 episodes ( 2 and a half hours total animation) our team will need some financial support, because the work needs more responsibility, time, and attention to detail.</li>
<li>
<strong><i>Equipment:</i></strong> To this point we have managed to hire some of the needed equipment, but for a longer period and more sustained work we need to invest in buying our own.</li>
<li>
<strong><i>Place: </i></strong>We want to rent a small office and turn it into a small studio, to be convenient for everyone to come and work.</li>
<li>
<i><strong>Social Media: </strong></i>All of you know how important it is to share and promote your work, especially online!</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Luci Holland</strong> is one extremely talented composer from Edinburgh, Scotland. She voluntarily made the intro music in her studio. We also need to refine the whole music effects and sounds in general. She has plans to improve the voice over for the rest of the videos, and an idea to record some kids’ voices, potentially by connecting with youth arts and music organisations in Scotland to make creative opportunities for children.</p>

<p><strong>Why we have “flexible goal”?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Risks</strong></p>
<p>We are deeply committed to making “The adventures of Lilly. The Bulgarian alphabet” and to putting it out into the world once it's ready. This means that even if we do not reach our goal, we will find a way of making our animation series, while at the same time compensating everyone who got involved. It just means that there will be a pay cut and that we may have to settle for less fancy equipment.  No matter what stands in our way, “The adventures of Lilly. The Bulgarian alphabet” will happen.</p>

Да научим българската азбука“, които са подходящи за деца от 2 до 7 години. Лили е малко весело момиченце със синя коса и голям син кит за приятел, с когото обичат да приключенстват.</p><p>Всеки един от епизодите отделя специално внимание на всяка една буква от българската азбуката, чрез създадена кратка история с Лили и нейните приятели. Епизодите учат децата и на важни добродетели като приятелството, честността, готовността да се притечеш на помощ на някой в беда и т.н.  Пъстрите герои са весели и добри ,а музиката е ненатоварваща и приятна за слушане. Частта с пластелинената работилница провокира децата да са креативни в своите игри и да използват материали и техники,стимулиращи творческото мислене и развитието на фината моторика.</p><p>Епизодите представляват съчетание от куклен театър, класическа анимационн изрезкова техника с пластелин, пиксилация (стоп моушън с  живи хора  и предмети) и компютърна изрезка.Надяваме се, че това съчетание ще поддържа интереса и вниманието от началото до края на епизодите и ще бъде любопитно и за родителите.</p><p><strong>Какво сме направили до сега?</strong></p><p>Първи епизод  за буквата „А“ е вече създаден и готов за гледане.Той е с дължина от 4мин и 31сек. В основната история се разказва за едно малко агънце, което се е изгубило и Лили му помага да се намери своята майка.</p><p>Разработени са останалите 29 епизода на етап сценарии и сториборд. Самите истории са подготвени от човек с педагогическо образование и с дългододишен опит и работа с деца, като след това са оформени по лесносъчетаващ се начин с характеристиката на самите герои и стила анимация.</p><p>Пластелинените изрезки , декорите и куклата водещ са също готови.</p><p><strong>Началото </strong></p><p>Лили не е спирала да приключенства. През 2013 беше завършен първият късометражен филм за деца, поставящ началото на поредицата „Приключенията на Лили.“ Той е с подзаглавие „Костенурчето“ и може свободно да бъде гледан в youtube :</p><p>******* <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSCevTToP58"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSCevTToP58</a> *******</p><p> През 2014 филмът беше номиринар в категория за най-добър детски анимационен филм на международния фестивал „New Wave” в гр. София.Малко след това получихме покана за  участие във международония фестивал за детско образователно кино„Mice“ във Валенсия, Испания както и в Техеран, Иран.  След това през 2014г втората серия на филма „Приключенията на Лили.Подаръкът“ беше удобрена за финансиране като дебют от Национален филмов център с подкрепата на  „Ветрогон-Бг“ и филмът беше завършен успешно през март 2016.</p><p><strong>Защо го правим?</strong></p><p>Двата филма са съчетание от две класически анимационни техники:</p><p>Анимация рисувана на хартия, оцветена дигитално и пластелинова изрезка (стоп анимация). Процесът е твърде дълъг и тежък и новия проект имаше нужда от по-бърз темп на развитие и лекота в действието. Акцентът е променен и насочен към българската азбука, защото след кратко проучване екипът ни установи, че няма подходящи, добре разработени и естетически издържани анимационни серии за най-малките.</p><p>През 2017 беше издадена и образователната книжка за деца по първият филм.</p><p>След  досегашния ни опит преценихме, че е време да излезем от зоната си на комфорт и да направим един обществено значим проект.</p><p><strong>Нашата мисия/цел:</strong></p><p>Нашата цел чрез тази образователна поредица е да заинтригуваме децата не само да научат българската азбука, но и да направим техния свят малко по-весел и пъстър. Да им подскажем,че правенето на добрини е хубаво и не е никак трудно. Достатъчно е само да имаш добри приятели и усмивка на лицето.</p><p><strong>Бюжет:</strong></p><p>Първи епизод  за буквата „А“ беше само началото на нашето приключение. За да можем да стигнем неговия край, ще имаме нужда от вас и вашата подкрепа. Досега целият екип работеше абсолютно доброволно и в приятелска атмосфера. Всеки даваше част от свободното си време, за да може нещата да се движат напред.</p><p><strong>Заплащане на екипа:</strong> За да направим обаче останалите 29 епизода екипът заслужава  финансова подкрепа,тъй като работата по всеки един епизод е отговорна и изисква отделяне на повече време и внимание, за да стане още по-добре и изпипана в детайл.</p><p><strong>Техника:</strong>  До сега успявахме да наемем нужната техника, но за по-продължителен период на работа предпочитаме да инвестираме в наша собсвтена, за да работи по-бързо,по-лесно и по-всяко време.</p><p><strong>Наем:</strong> До сега работехме от вкъщи, но решихме,че е по-добре   да наемем и малък офис, който да превърнем в студио, за да е по-удобно за всички.</p><p><strong>Музика:</strong> Луси Холанд е един изключителен композитор от Единбург, Шотландия и тя напълно доброволно се съгласи да създаде и музиката за началото на филма в своето студио. Работата  по цялостното озвучаване и допълване със звукови ефекти обаче също не е лека задача.</p><p>Има идея да добави и запис на детски гласове, както и по-добър задкадров глас на видеата.</p><p><strong>Ако не можете да ни подкрепите финансово, ще сме ви благодарни и само да разпространите проекта навсякъде, където ви хрумне (социални медии, собствен блог или просто да разкажете)</strong></p><p><strong>Facebook -</strong> <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/lillyandthewhale/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/lillyandthewhale/</a></p><p><strong>Instagram -</strong> <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/Lilly_and_the_whale/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.instagram.com/Lilly_and_the_whale/</a></p><p><strong>Екип</strong></p><p><strong>Анита Тончева</strong> е автор, режисьор и аниматор на проекта “Приключенията на Лили“.

Our small talented team of specialists came up with the animation series called “The Adventures of Lilly: The Bulgarian Alphabet” (suitable for children aged between 2 and 7 years).  Lilly is a little happy girl with blue hair and a big blue whale as her friend, and together they go on adventures!
Each episode pays special attention to one character of the Bulgarian alphabet, with a short story about Lilly and her friends. The episodes will teach kids important values such as being friendly, honest, and helpful. The colourful characters are positive and inquisitive, with upbeat music accompanying the action to foster a friendly learning environment. Included in the show is a section with a clay workshop which is designed to stimulate children to be creative in their games and crafts, use a variety of materials, encourage their creative thinking, and aid developmental skills (such as hand-eye coordination).
To create the episodes we use a combination of Puppet Theater, cut-out Claymation, pixilation (stop motion with real human and objects), and computer cut-out animation. We believe that these combinations will create an eye-catching, colourful and textural look for the show, sustaining interest and attention from the beginning, and will be interesting for parents as well!
What we have done until now?
The first episode (the letter A) is completely finished and ready to be seen. The video length is 4min and 31 sec. The main story is about a little lamb that got lost, and Lilly helps him find his mother.

The rest of the 29 stories have been scripted and storyboarded. The stories are written by a person with pedagogical education who has experience working with children. The stories are matched with the characteristics of the characters and the animation style.
 

 
The beginning:

The “Adventures of Lilly”
2013 was the beginning of the first animation movie for kids called “Adventures of Lilly” titled “The little turtle”. Lilly is the main character of the movie and until the year 2013, she was out for adventures. Below is the Youtube link of the video. Enjoy!
 ******* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSCevTToP58 *******
The year 2014, the movie was nominated the best animation short movie in the international film festival “New Wave” in Sofia, Bulgaria. Shortly after that we received an invitation to participate with it in the international festival for educational animation for children “Mice” in Valencia, Spain and in Teheran, Iran.
A bit later the same year, the second episode of “Adventures of Lilly won the first prize for a debut short animation competition sponsored by the national film center (NFC) in Bulgaria. With the support of the producers from “Vetrogon-bg” studio the movie was successfully completed in March 2016.

Why we are doing it?
These two movies are made with two classical animation techniques: hand drawn animation on paper, and clay cut out (stop motion). This process is quite time consuming – but produces interesting creative results! Our new project needed some speed and ease in the development, and we decided to work with the Bulgarian alphabet as subject matter because after some research, our team found out that there are no well-developed suitable and aesthetically finished animation series for young children.
In 2017, the first book “The adventures of Lilly: The Turtle” was published; it’s educational and follows the story line of the very first movie.
So after all of this experience we decided to get out of our comfort zones, and create a project with social impact and meaning.

Our mission/goal:
Our mission is to teach the kids not only the Bulgarian alphabet, but also to bring them happiness and make their world colourful. We want to encourage children to know that all that matters is to be good and do good, and all it takes is to have good friends and a smile on your face.
Budget:
The first episode about the letter A is just the beginning of our adventure. To reach the end we need you and your support. Till now the whole team are working completely voluntarily. Each one of us has given part of our free time so that the project could move forward.
By contributing to the project, you will be funding the following:


Paying the Cast & Crew: it's very important for us to be able to compensate everyone who is dedicating time and energy to the making of the ""Adventures of Lilly: The Bulgarian Alphabet"" - we do not believe in the ""expenses only"" approach. To be able to do the rest of the 29 episodes ( 2 and a half hours total animation) our team will need some financial support, because the work needs more responsibility, time, and attention to detail.

Equipment: To this point we have managed to hire some of the needed equipment, but for a longer period and more sustained work we need to invest in buying our own.

Place: We want to rent a small office and turn it into a small studio, to be convenient for everyone to come and work.

Social Media: All of you know how important it is to share and promote your work, especially online!

Luci Holland is one extremely talented composer from Edinburgh, Scotland. She voluntarily made the intro music in her studio. We also need to refine the whole music effects and sounds in general. She has plans to improve the voice over for the rest of the videos, and an idea to record some kids’ voices, potentially by connecting with youth arts and music organisations in Scotland to make creative opportunities for children.

Even if you can't support us financially, it would be just as beneficial if you spread the word: Share the campaign on social media or on your blog, or just tell people about the project.

Why we have “flexible goal”?
Even if we don't reach our final goal, the entire amount collected will still be invested in the same areas of the project. No matter what percentage of the goal we reach, everyone who ordered a T-shirt or a Toy etc. will receive it as planned.

Risks
We are deeply committed to making “The adventures of Lilly. The Bulgarian alphabet” and to putting it out into the world once it's ready. This means that even if we do not reach our goal, we will find a way of making our animation series, while at the same time compensating everyone who got involved. It just means that there will be a pay cut and that we may have to settle for less fancy equipment.  No matter what stands in our way, “The adventures of Lilly. The Bulgarian alphabet” will happen.
Thank you all and keep following your dreams!<3 <3 <3ИсторияНашият малък, но талантлив екип от специалисти е подготвил за вас серия от образователни епизоди наречени „Приключенията на Лили. Да научим българската азбука“, които са подходящи за деца от 2 до 7 години. Лили е малко весело момиченце със синя коса и голям син кит за приятел, с когото обичат да приключенстват.Всеки един от епизодите отделя специално внимание на всяка една буква от българската азбуката, чрез създадена кратка история с Лили и нейните приятели. Епизодите учат децата и на важни добродетели като приятелството, честността, готовността да се притечеш на помощ на някой в беда и т.н.  Пъстрите герои са весели и добри ,а музиката е ненатоварваща и приятна за слушане. Частта с пластелинената работилница провокира децата да са креативни в своите игри и да използват материали и техники,стимулиращи творческото мислене и развитието на фината моторика.Епизодите представляват съчетание от куклен театър, класическа анимационн изрезкова техника с пластелин, пиксилация (стоп моушън с  живи хора  и предмети) и компютърна изрезка.Надяваме се, че това съчетание ще поддържа интереса и вниманието от началото до края на епизодите и ще бъде любопитно и за родителите.Какво сме направили до сега?Първи епизод  за буквата „А“ е вече създаден и готов за гледане.Той е с дължина от 4мин и 31сек. В основната история се разказва за едно малко агънце, което се е изгубило и Лили му помага да се намери своята майка.Разработени са останалите 29 епизода на етап сценарии и сториборд. Самите истории са подготвени от човек с педагогическо образование и с дългододишен опит и работа с деца, като след това са оформени по лесносъчетаващ се начин с характеристиката на самите герои и стила анимация.Пластелинените изрезки , декорите и куклата водещ са също готови.Началото Лили не е спирала да приключенства. През 2013 беше завършен първият късометражен филм за деца, поставящ началото на поредицата „Приключенията на Лили.“ Той е с подзаглавие „Костенурчето“ и може свободно да бъде гледан в youtube :******* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSCevTToP58 ******* През 2014 филмът беше номиринар в категория за най-добър детски анимационен филм на международния фестивал „New Wave” в гр. София.Малко след това получихме покана за  участие във международония фестивал за детско образователно кино„Mice“ във Валенсия, Испания както и в Техеран, Иран.  След това през 2014г втората серия на филма „Приключенията на Лили.Подаръкът“ беше удобрена за финансиране като дебют от Национален филмов център с подкрепата на  „Ветрогон-Бг“ и филмът беше завършен успешно през март 2016.Защо го правим?Двата филма са съчетание от две класически анимационни техники:Анимация рисувана на хартия, оцветена дигитално и пластелинова изрезка (стоп анимация). Процесът е твърде дълъг и тежък и новия проект имаше нужда от по-бърз темп на развитие и лекота в действието. Акцентът е променен и насочен към българската азбука, защото след кратко проучване екипът ни установи, че няма подходящи, добре разработени и естетически издържани анимационни серии за най-малките.През 2017 беше издадена и образователната книжка за деца по първият филм.След  досегашния ни опит преценихме, че е време да излезем от зоната си на комфорт и да направим един обществено значим проект.Нашата мисия/цел:Нашата цел чрез тази образователна поредица е да заинтригуваме децата не само да научат българската азбука, но и да направим техния свят малко по-весел и пъстър. Да им подскажем,че правенето на добрини е хубаво и не е никак трудно. Достатъчно е само да имаш добри приятели и усмивка на лицето.Бюжет:Първи епизод  за буквата „А“ беше само началото на нашето приключение. За да можем да стигнем неговия край, ще имаме нужда от вас и вашата подкрепа. Досега целият екип работеше абсолютно доброволно и в приятелска атмосфера. Всеки даваше част от свободното си време, за да може нещата да се движат напред.Заплащане на екипа: За да направим обаче останалите 29 епизода екипът заслужава  финансова подкрепа,тъй като работата по всеки един епизод е отговорна и изисква отделяне на повече време и внимание, за да стане още по-добре и изпипана в детайл.Техника:  До сега успявахме да наемем нужната техника, но за по-продължителен период на работа предпочитаме да инвестираме в наша собсвтена, за да работи по-бързо,по-лесно и по-всяко време.Наем: До сега работехме от вкъщи, но решихме,че е по-добре   да наемем и малък офис, който да превърнем в студио, за да е по-удобно за всички.Музика: Луси Холанд е един изключителен композитор от Единбург, Шотландия и тя напълно доброволно се съгласи да създаде и музиката за началото на филма в своето студио. Работата  по цялостното озвучаване и допълване със звукови ефекти обаче също не е лека задача.Има идея да добави и запис на детски гласове, както и по-добър задкадров глас на видеата.Ако не можете да ни подкрепите финансово, ще сме ви благодарни и само да разпространите проекта навсякъде, където ви хрумне (социални медии, собствен блог или просто да разкажете)Facebook - https://www.facebook.com/lillyandthewhale/Instagram - https://www.instagram.com/Lilly_and_the_whale/ЕкипАнита Тончева е автор, режисьор и аниматор на проекта “Приключенията на Лили“.

<h3>What is On Air</h3>
<p><i>On Air</i> is an award winning, five time festival finalist, sitcom that follows the cast and crew of a hit variety show and their lives behind the scenes. It's <i>Brooklyn Nine Nine</i> meets <i>Community</i> meets <i>30 Rock</i>!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>When his mentor is accused of sexual harassment and fired, the immature and easy going star of a hit variety show is determined to show the program's new producer who's really the boss, in a battle to find out who really runs the studio- the suits or the subordinates.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The cast of sketch comedy show <i>Weekly Tonight (</i>made up of the carefree and goofball star, Josh Tilson, his underachieving and stoner best friend, Chris Key, the disgraced child star turned social justice advocate, Melanie Reed, the eccentric and politically incorrect English comedian Jebediah Polumbo, and new girl, the innocent and sweet natured Emma Ricci) are all shocked to hear that the former producer of their show has been fired due to sexual harassment claims. The surprises don't stop there, as it is also revealed a new producer has been hired and will soon make himself known. Josh, the unofficial leader of the group, takes it upon himself to ""mark his territory"" and show the new producer who's really in charge. However, the question of why is unclear- is the reason because he wants to protect the show, whose future may be in jeopardy, or are there more deep rooted issues to be addressed? Ex wive reunions, underground baking clubs, and much much more, in this hilarious, award winning, multi festival finalist sitcom that proves what happens on camera is nothing compared to what goes on off it. </p>

<h3>About Me:</h3>
<p>You're not going to trust your money with just anyone, so let me tell you a little bit about myself, I'm Ryan Conway! I'm a 24 year old actor/comedian/writer and the creator and one of the stars of On Air. I graduated undergrad in 2019 at Sacred Heart University, majoring in communications with a focus in film and television, and am currently enrolled in the school's Film and Television Master's Program.</p>
<p>For as long as I could remember, I always loved to make people laugh and smile. I like to be happy and I like to make others happy, that's why I love comedy so much. Anyway, when I was a senior, I was tasked to come up with a thesis project. Because of my love for the film and television industry, and comedy in general, I opted to make my own sitcom reminiscent of the ones I love watching, and from there, On Air was born.</p>
<p>The original On Air was written by myself and one of my childhood friends, we made the pilot with non professional actors (the cast was made up of my friends and myself, me being the only one with any sort of experience), non professional equipment (we really only had a Canon Photo Camera and a shotgun mic to work with), no crew (if cast members weren't in front of the camera, they were behind it), etc. It was a school project, and the finishing product reflected that.</p>
<p>However, despite the obvious amateur production, the pilot ended up being a five time finalist, a semi finalist, a five time Official Selection, and an Award Winner across multiple festivals. Even festivals that rejected us praised the show's writing, originality, and characters, but ultimately rejected it due to production value.</p>
<p>Now, two years later, because I am a student in a film and graduate program, we're going back and ""rebooting"" On Air with a brand new pilot. The script is tighter, we have a full crew and equipment at our disposal to make it look and feel professional, we have actual locations, and an amazingly talented cast of amazing actors (who quite frankly are way too good to be working with me), and we're ready to roll. We were able to have a lot of success without any of this, so imagine what we could accomplish with help. We are currently gearing up to shoot the pilot episode, and hope to shoot more subsequent episodes this summer to package and pitch to networks, to give them a better idea of what On Air is, which begs the question...</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Are We Looking For?</h3>
<p>We are seeking $5,000 (flexible goal) to help fund the production of On Air. The money would go towards cast salaries (who as of now are working for free because they believe in the project), craft services, post production, set decoration, festival runs, lodging for cast and crew if necessary, make up, music royalties, etc. It would also be used for future episodes, which would allow us to experiment and really show our true vision for On Air (Just to give you a taste, we're currently throwing around ideas for episodes that are spoofs of Oceans Eleven (2001), Election (1999), All the President's Men (1976), The West Wing (1999-2006), Ferris Bueller's Day Off (1986), The Office (2005-2013), Clue (1985), and much more). It's a very bold and ambitious task(s), but I think it's one all of us are up for an eager to do.</p>
<p>If we do not reach our entire goal, the plan is to still move forward with whatever resources we do have to produce On Air, with slight altercations. If we manage to make more money than we asked for, all of it will be put towards more resources to make sure the pilot and other episodes even better than any of us expected! </p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What are the Risks? Challenges?</h3>
<p>This could all blow up in our face. Plain and simple. Maybe it won't get picked up, maybe we wasted hours of our lives working on this thing that will never get on the air, maybe it'll flop. However, it's not going to, because none of us are going to let it. I was able to make the original pilot- which while I'm proud of it, totally acknowledge that it was kind of a hot mess- a success. Now I have an amazing team with me that are all as passionate about the project as I am. We have been working on this for the last year, we have rewritten the script countless times, we spent months casting the perfect person for each role, etc. Everything in life is a risk, especially when it comes to money. But, this isn't a risk, this is a investment, and I promise if you believe in us, you will get a return on your investment.</p>

If we do not reach our entire goal, the plan is to still move forward with whatever resources we do have to produce On Air, with slight altercations. If we manage to make more money than we asked for, all of it will be put towards more resources to make sure the pilot and other episodes even better than any of us expected! 
 

What are the Risks? Challenges?
This could all blow up in our face. Plain and simple. Maybe it won't get picked up, maybe we wasted hours of our lives working on this thing that will never get on the air, maybe it'll flop. However, it's not going to, because none of us are going to let it. I was able to make the original pilot- which while I'm proud of it, totally acknowledge that it was kind of a hot mess- a success. Now I have an amazing team with me that are all as passionate about the project as I am. We have been working on this for the last year, we have rewritten the script countless times, we spent months casting the perfect person for each role, etc. Everything in life is a risk, especially when it comes to money. But, this isn't a risk, this is a investment, and I promise if you believe in us, you will get a return on your investment.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>After a break for the holidays we are back to filming for the second  half of the season! That means working with even more actors in even more locations, and we can't be more excited!</p>
<p>***<strong>For those of you who are here for the first time</strong>, check out THE HAROLD STRUCTURE section below for a short description about our project and its inspiration***</p>
<p>We plan on releasing this the entire season on Youtube in the first half of 2018! <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvYLABc-3hIzWjXpQnUEvUg"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Be sure to check out our channel</a> (&lt;-- Psssst. Hyperlink next door) to see our old videos and get updates on new ones right when they come out! This show tells some important stories so we want to share this with as many people as we can. </p>
<p>We also want to show off our friends as much as we can! Some people warn you not to cast your friends as actors but when they're all amazing artists it's kind of hard not to.</p>
<h3><strong><u>BEHIND-THE-SCENES</u></strong></h3>
<p>This project has allowed us to rent awesome equipment that has given us some amazing shots! Your contributions allow us to think outside the box and create some unique set-ups such as car mounts, drone shots, steadicams, and much more!</p>

<h3><u><strong>RISKS AND CHALLENGES</strong></u></h3>
<p>Because we are such a low-budget production we have to spend our time, resources, and money wisely. We have to plan thoroughly for things we can can control like availabilities and locations as well as things we can't control like weather or other events happening in Chicago so that we can cover everything that we need to for the project without breaking the bank.</p>
<p>Baby, It's Cold Outside. Although we planned our season to take place in the winter this brings its own set of challenges like crew safety and added weather unpredictability. We'll be prepared for the cold with hand-warmers, warm food and drinks, and extra warm clothing.</p>
<p>Coordinating meeting, schedules, meals, and costumes for over 30 actors can be tricky at times, but it is worth it. Everyone in the cast is absolutely amazing and working hard to make the project the best it can be.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u><strong>THE HAROLD STRUCTURE</strong></u></h3>
<p>Life of Harold is a spin on the Harold improv form which uses a 3 act structure with 12 total scenes that alternate between games and more grounded stories.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1514750950/glesk60e2czdhj6vncht.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>But the project is about more than just improv. Every Harold show starts with a suggestion, and our's for this season was The Standpoint Theory. This is an idea in Intersectionality that suggests that our perspectives are shaped by our social and political experiences. It seems kind of obvious, right? Of course our experiences help shape our perception of the world. But it's important to remember that MY experiences only shape MY perception, in a sea of countless other equally valid perceptions. That's our theme of the season and each episode will find some way to talk about that.</p>
<p>Chicago Improv + Harold Form + Chicago Life = Life of Harold</p>
<p>The idea for Life of Harold came about the way many great things do - two best friends talking. We have been friends for over 14 years and are pursuing careers in the film industry. We relocated to Chicago over a year ago and fell in love with the theatre scene, specifically the improv scene.</p>
<p>The idea for the show was also spawned from a college project that utilized the same improv acting style to tell a narrative story.</p>
<p>This project grew into something bigger than we could have dreamed. The money from your contributions will go towards helping us pay for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Food</li>
<li>Film equipment</li>
<li>Our friends' valuable time</li>
<li>Cold Weather Prep (Extra left socks)</li>

<h3>WELCOME TO NORMAL, ILLINOIS!</h3>
<p><i>Normal, Illinois</i> is a half-hour paranormal comedy pilot being produced in NYU's Intermediate Children's TV Production Workshop. This show follows Greer Gallagher and her Catholic family as they unknowingly move into a very haunted house. After repeated disturbances by a potentially paranormal presence, Greer finds that the only person who will believe her is Margo, the nutty head (and only member) of the school’s paranormal enthusiast club. Joined by skeptic and next-door-neighbor Patrick, the three teens try to uncover the presence lurking in the Gallagher home...and eventually the paranormal occurrences throughout Normal. </p>
<p><strong>Statement from Creator Jori Johnson:</strong></p>
<p>In a strange way, this is both the final project AND first project of my time at NYU. While I have served as a Producer on countless Film and TV projects over the past few years, I haven't had the opportunity to bring a script of my own to life. I wrote <i>Normal, Illinois</i> in class during the Fall 2019 semester and went crazy with it, including all of the spooky, funny, weird content and characters I have always wanted to see on TV. I never thought I would have the opportunity to make it, but I submitted it for consideration at the encouragement of my professor, and I'm honored that it is one of two pilots selected for production this Spring. </p>
<p>An incredibly talented team of student filmmakers is now working together to bring this vision to life, but we are missing one key ingredient: YOU!</p>
<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Filmmaking is an expensive endeavor. Locations, equipment, costumes, props, transportation, and meals are just a few of the expenses we will have to cover over the course of our three weekends of production.</p>
<p>Your contribution will allow us to put together a successful production. Every dollar will have a direct impact on our ability to feed our student cast and crew, rent equipment to make this pilot look amazing, and build the world of <i>Normal, Illinois</i> through production design.</p>
<p>We can't thank you enough for your help, but we'll do our best by providing Perks for every donation, ranging from exclusive behind-the-scenes content to being credited on the project!</p>

</div></div>","WELCOME TO NORMAL, ILLINOIS!
Normal, Illinois is a half-hour paranormal comedy pilot being produced in NYU's Intermediate Children's TV Production Workshop. This show follows Greer Gallagher and her Catholic family as they unknowingly move into a very haunted house. After repeated disturbances by a potentially paranormal presence, Greer finds that the only person who will believe her is Margo, the nutty head (and only member) of the school’s paranormal enthusiast club. Joined by skeptic and next-door-neighbor Patrick, the three teens try to uncover the presence lurking in the Gallagher home...and eventually the paranormal occurrences throughout Normal. 
Statement from Creator Jori Johnson:
In a strange way, this is both the final project AND first project of my time at NYU. While I have served as a Producer on countless Film and TV projects over the past few years, I haven't had the opportunity to bring a script of my own to life. I wrote Normal, Illinois in class during the Fall 2019 semester and went crazy with it, including all of the spooky, funny, weird content and characters I have always wanted to see on TV. I never thought I would have the opportunity to make it, but I submitted it for consideration at the encouragement of my professor, and I'm honored that it is one of two pilots selected for production this Spring. 
An incredibly talented team of student filmmakers is now working together to bring this vision to life, but we are missing one key ingredient: YOU!

What We Need & What You Get
Filmmaking is an expensive endeavor. Locations, equipment, costumes, props, transportation, and meals are just a few of the expenses we will have to cover over the course of our three weekends of production.
Your contribution will allow us to put together a successful production. Every dollar will have a direct impact on our ability to feed our student cast and crew, rent equipment to make this pilot look amazing, and build the world of Normal, Illinois through production design.
We can't thank you enough for your help, but we'll do our best by providing Perks for every donation, ranging from exclusive behind-the-scenes content to being credited on the project!


Why Support Us?

This production team is DOMINATED by women in key crew positions. By supporting this project, you are supporting the future careers of women in the Film & TV industry!
This project is part of the NYU curriculum. By supporting Normal, Illinois, you will be supporting the education of dozens of students!
Everyone loves a good spooky story, and you will be helping to bring a great one to life!

<p><u><strong>Short Summary</strong></u></p>
<p>I moved to LA two years ago to do this - create. To bring my humor and insight into reality. To be a part of the most beautiful and collaborative art form of the modern age- television. Shows can only be made when all the painters get to put their mark on the canvas, when all the writers, editors, cast and crew come together in sync for a common vision. This project is my baby and is dedicated to the friends back home I wish I could have brunch with.</p>
<p><u><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></u></p>
<p>We need at least $2,000 for location, insurance, and set dressing. We have an amazing team of talented people who are giving this their all. Every cent will go into the production of this series for your entertainment pleasure. With your donation you will receive a selection of wonderful gifts ranging from social media shout outs to joining us in Los Angeles for our viewing party.</p>
<p><u><strong>The Impact</strong></u></p>
<p>While the theme might seem frivolous, the subject matter is pretty powerful. Our characters are dealing with things like learning how to embrace their sexual orientation and love themselves after living in a repressed environment. We’ve got someone trying to save the ocean through his documentary about real things that are happening to our environment, while struggling to keep his own life afloat. There are two strong, independant characters who are setting the example of what powerful female friendships can look like when we stop living in competition with each other. These are relationships we can learn from and connect to.</p>
<p><u><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></u></p>
<p>Please spread the word about BRUNCH SO HARD. Tell your friends, followers, random people on the street. Feel free to use the Indiegogo share tools. Anyway to get the word out helps! We have two great marketing campaigns going on right now through our Instagram and Twitter. #followthebacon is about our mascot, the Bacon Babe, as she travels around LA spreading the joy of brunch. And #brunchspot is where we go to cafes across LA and feature their brunch menu for an entire week to cross promote with businesses. </p>

If you like dumb jokes, you'll love this show. If you like absurd pranks, you'll love this show. If you like building rich comedic reference-based methods of group communication through the development of excessive inside jokes and obscure analogies that saturate your everyday speech to the point of sounding like nonsense to any outside listener, you'll love this show. And if you like vaguely pretentious rambling for the sake of humor, you'll love this show. </p>

Our goal reflects what we need in order to produce this series without paying any more out of pocket, because let's be honest, we're artists living in LA, we need our pocket money for rent.</p>
<p>If we exceed our goal we'll be able to pay everyone involved a little more, and maybe even churn out some bonus content for you beautiful internet charity saints. If we don't quite reach our goal, we'll take what we can get and film as much as we can, so you magnificent internet donor angels can still get some of our comedy gold, and we'll finish the rest as soon we can.</p>

<h2>Meet the Cast! </h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Liam Hawley as Ben</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561449966/qnhrzhlgzankui4uqbus.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Liam Hawley is an American actor and writer most notably known for his fear of bugs. New to Los Angeles, Liam comes from Phoenix Arizona where he's lived since he was but a wee four year old. He discovered his love for writing and acting back in 2011 while attending college at Arizona State University. His hatred for insects however was uncovered long before then. Finding his deep passion for the arts pushed Liam to get involved in any film project that he could get his grubby little hands on, and over the years, he's been lucky to be cast in all kinds of productions, from shorts like the psychological thriller Crocotta to full-length indie features like Elastic Heart. He appreciates every chance he gets to act and is determined to continue grow as an artist... this is provided that no bugs are involved in any part of a production. This doesn't mean just no cockroaches and creepy centipedes either here folks, we're talking basically the whole freakin bug gamut. Even slightly less disgusting ones like crickets are off the table. Maybe ants are cool, but then you have to consider, how many are there? One ant is no big deal, but you got hundreds of those bad boys crawling all over you? Yeah, no thanks!... Liam is extremely excited to be cast as the role of Ben in the series Consciously Incompetent and looks forward to all the money that this role will bring him in the years to come.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Reid Schmidt as Todd</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562747192/qkcfit8x84ufuuib41ro.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Reid grew up in New Jersey and attended college in Boston before ultimately making the move to the west coast. His interest in acting began with a school production of Guys &amp; Dolls, and continues today with short films in Los Angeles. An avid fan of Hollywood's Golden Age, Reid looks to the stars of yesteryear for inspiration in his life. He enjoys spending time at the movies and making terrible puns out of his name. There is also a non-zero chance that Reid is actually a large colony of bugs wearing a human-suit. Please, nobody tell Liam. </p>

<h3>Chelsea Collins as Isabel</h3>

<p>Chelsea Collins hails from Charlottesville, Virginia, a city of art, apples and a story of an unlikely bond. In her youth, Chelsea qualified for the Junior Olympics in doubles jump roping, paired with her arch nemesis, Kathleen. They were enemies in the real world but jumped rope together with the bond and synchronicity of life long friends. Ultimately, they decided not to compete and have never seen each other since. Chelsea still wonders what happened to Kathleen and hopes she has finally found happiness. <br/>Chelsea's other interests include all day breakfast, dogs, robots, fluffy blankets and Brendan Fraser's ""The Mummy.""</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Maggie Dorfman as Emily</h3>

<p>Maggie Dorfman has survived 1 year of adulthood thus far after graduating with a BFA Theatre Performance degree from Chapman University.

We are Rob and Micala, the Important Business Partners of An Important Business Office. This is our web series.
Rob Miller, beloved writer and comedy genius who definitely is not the one writing this summary, wanted to write a show for weirdos, by weirdos, with weirdos in it. This is that show. If you like dumb jokes, you'll love this show. If you like absurd pranks, you'll love this show. If you like building rich comedic reference-based methods of group communication through the development of excessive inside jokes and obscure analogies that saturate your everyday speech to the point of sounding like nonsense to any outside listener, you'll love this show. And if you like vaguely pretentious rambling for the sake of humor, you'll love this show. 
Also there are cute pets in it. 
Micala Stone did not approve this summary. 
Please Give Us Money, We'll Reward You With Weird Junk

We've got everything we need lined up to produce the ultimate web series, now we just need some funding to make it all happen. Your contributions will go toward paying for crew and equipment, acquiring props, feeding the team, and making sure we can put out a professional quality series. Our goal reflects what we need in order to produce this series without paying any more out of pocket, because let's be honest, we're artists living in LA, we need our pocket money for rent.
If we exceed our goal we'll be able to pay everyone involved a little more, and maybe even churn out some bonus content for you beautiful internet charity saints. If we don't quite reach our goal, we'll take what we can get and film as much as we can, so you magnificent internet donor angels can still get some of our comedy gold, and we'll finish the rest as soon we can.
Now let's get to the good stuff- Perks. You greedy little internet patron heroes love those sweet, sweet perks, and boy do we have some for you. Your contributions could get your name in the credits, your picture on the set, some cute animal pics, exclusive access to behind the scenes shenanigans, various merch, and maybe even a custom handmade craft project! 
 
Meet the Cast! 
 
Liam Hawley as Ben

Liam Hawley is an American actor and writer most notably known for his fear of bugs. New to Los Angeles, Liam comes from Phoenix Arizona where he's lived since he was but a wee four year old. He discovered his love for writing and acting back in 2011 while attending college at Arizona State University. His hatred for insects however was uncovered long before then. Finding his deep passion for the arts pushed Liam to get involved in any film project that he could get his grubby little hands on, and over the years, he's been lucky to be cast in all kinds of productions, from shorts like the psychological thriller Crocotta to full-length indie features like Elastic Heart. He appreciates every chance he gets to act and is determined to continue grow as an artist... this is provided that no bugs are involved in any part of a production. This doesn't mean just no cockroaches and creepy centipedes either here folks, we're talking basically the whole freakin bug gamut. Even slightly less disgusting ones like crickets are off the table. Maybe ants are cool, but then you have to consider, how many are there? One ant is no big deal, but you got hundreds of those bad boys crawling all over you? Yeah, no thanks!... Liam is extremely excited to be cast as the role of Ben in the series Consciously Incompetent and looks forward to all the money that this role will bring him in the years to come.  
 
Reid Schmidt as Todd

Reid grew up in New Jersey and attended college in Boston before ultimately making the move to the west coast. His interest in acting began with a school production of Guys & Dolls, and continues today with short films in Los Angeles. An avid fan of Hollywood's Golden Age, Reid looks to the stars of yesteryear for inspiration in his life. He enjoys spending time at the movies and making terrible puns out of his name. There is also a non-zero chance that Reid is actually a large colony of bugs wearing a human-suit. Please, nobody tell Liam. 
 
Chelsea Collins as Isabel

Chelsea Collins hails from Charlottesville, Virginia, a city of art, apples and a story of an unlikely bond. In her youth, Chelsea qualified for the Junior Olympics in doubles jump roping, paired with her arch nemesis, Kathleen. They were enemies in the real world but jumped rope together with the bond and synchronicity of life long friends. Ultimately, they decided not to compete and have never seen each other since. Chelsea still wonders what happened to Kathleen and hopes she has finally found happiness. Chelsea's other interests include all day breakfast, dogs, robots, fluffy blankets and Brendan Fraser's ""The Mummy.""
 
Maggie Dorfman as Emily

Maggie Dorfman has survived 1 year of adulthood thus far after graduating with a BFA Theatre Performance degree from Chapman University. During her time there, she discovered the skill of crying on command and was consistently the only student in class given a maximum page count for essays instead of a minimum one. Her favorite foods include bread (from New York with butter from Normandy) and Ben and Jerry's Half Baked ice cream. She once accidentally stapled two people with a staple gun and is known for traveling home to New York with an empty suitcase so that she can bring 3 dozen rolls from her favorite bakery back to Los Angeles.

The show would still have the silliness and goofy antics of middle schoolers, but would also give a humanistic and human quality to the characters and story.  Enter ARTHUR FUTURO. Meet the Team Behind ARTHUR FUTURO Series Showrunner/Executive ProducerDavid W.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>In mainstream media, the black experience is primarily shown from an African-American perspective. As someone who has constantly had my blackness questioned due to my nationality, I've experienced first hand one of many consequences of monolithic black representation. Instead of trying to fit into ideas of what we <i>think</i> blackness is, I'm using this series to highlight the countless things it can be.<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you'll help me achieve my long term goal of taking this series to as many countries as possible.</p>
<ul>
<li>I raised a decent amount in the first campaign, and created this one after multiple requests!</li>
<li>The amount listed will allow me to pay for flights, housing, day to day expenses (meals, public transportation) and a local crew to film the videos.</li>
<li>The perks are as unique as the subjects we've interviewed. You can get anything from a photoshoot, to a wellness session!<br/> </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Black Beyond America is my oppourtunity to document the countless nuances that make up the black experience world wide. I want to also use this series as a chance to hire more black internationals in the film industry. Moving forward, it's important for me to have a crew that reflects those seen in front of the camera. </p>
<p>While we've successfully made a few videos in California, it's time to start our international journey, which is where you come in! The series can only go so far if we don't visit the countries in question - whether it's sharing stories with those back in the UK, digging into the black experience in Russia, or visiting islands in the Caribbean, we need your help.<br/> </p>
<h3><strong>Why I'm Doing This</strong></h3>
<p>Being black in The Ivory Coast is not the same as being black in Australia or Colombia. One of the beautiful things about us as a race is that culturally we're everywhere. Each video will hone in on our similarities, while celebrating our differences.</p>
<p>When it comes to the diaspora, I've become fascinated with the unknown. Even in present day, countries such as Mexico only acknowledged their black population on the National Census in 2015. In a world where nations consider their most beautiful to be those with the closest proximity to whiteness, I always wonder: who else is getting overlooked? The more I research, the more I discover the presence of black populations that (more often than not) been around for centuries (e.g. India's black population that settled in the country 400 years ago). <br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>No donation is too big or small. Any amount you can give will go towards food, travel, housing and paying the crew that'll make this happen. Even if you can't donate, here are some other way to help out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share on social media.</li>
<li>Share the project in online groups or forums to spread the word.</li>
</ul>
</div><p>In the long run, I aim to break the misconception that a black person's culture measures their worth in society. I aspire to have the series be part of a larger archive that is constantly being updated with new content, new experiences and new perspectives.</p></div>","Short Summary

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Demetrius Smith is a truck driver, author, producer and screenwriter with a flair for drama and dialogue. After a few years of driving while developing a story (web series), he completed his first dramatic script. Completely self-funded and with money earned from driving, MaCaleb Enterprise LLc was established. The first production is titled ""Scandal at Riverside High."" With the help of a  talented cast and crew, the goal is to turn these and other scripts into full-featured independent films/webisodes. The audience will simply be blown away by the wonderful story that this group of brilliant up-and-coming actors, directors and producers could bring to life on a meager budget. Their tireless efforts helped to lay the foundation for this epic suspense drama, which tells the sinister plot of a guidance counselor and just how far she is willing to go to gain control of a troubled inner-city high school. With donor support, the production of the entire first season can begin. Funds donated will be used to complete the project.  The funds will be allocated for paying principal cast members, supporting cast and crew, locations, equipment, travel, lodging/accommodations, catering, insurance, and miscellaneous expenses. If the financial goals aren't reached, MaCaleb Enterprise will forge on and utilize proceeds to continue producing community project ventures such as the promotional video shot for O.D. Wyatt High school in Fort Worth Tx. ( <a href=""https://youtu.be/Sncdybs3EF4"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://youtu.be/Sncdybs3EF4</a> ). It cost $5000 to produce the thirty-five-minute preview. It took over three full days of shooting.  After ten days of shooting and a budget of 15 thousand dollars, we can complete the entire first season.  As a show of appreciation for your donation, you can enjoy the thirty-minute short preview. Understandably, everyone can't contribute financially.  For those who can't donate, please help get the word out about this and future project by using Indiegogo share tools. Thanks in advance for your support. </p>

<p>We're so glad you found us! Mel Owens and Kate Villa are two comedy writers who are filming some of the writing that they've been working on. Kate and Mel are both Upright Citizen's Brigade-trained, and Kate has worked in the digital department of UCB comedy, and on shows such as The President Show (comedy central), The Break With Michelle Wolf (netflix), and on MTV pilots. Mel is a producer whose work has been featured on ABC, MTV, Buzzfeed, Glamour, Cosmopolitan and various other outlets. </p>
<p><strong>We're funding most of this out of pocket - but this is just a bump to make sure that those working as directors, DPs, editors, and art directors on our sketches and shorts are paid. </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We've created a team of mostly women+ in leadership roles and want them to be proud of the sketch they're putting their time into by paying them for their time and expertise and making sure the production value stays as high as possible.</li>
<li>In creating these sketches, we're giving women+ a way to showcase themselves. These videos can then be used as proof of work we're all proud of when someone looking to hire one of these people asks, ""Can you show me what you've been up to?"" </li>

<p>Following our premiere in New York City, The Pepper Project Pilot earned nearly thirty Awards and Nominations in International Festivals and Competitions from 2015-2018.  From Vancouver to Seoul, D.C. to Rio, Miami to Bilbao.

Because we have a wide fan base and an unstoppable fiery-passion to<strong> create</strong>, to tell more of Pepper's story, to continue the journey of a strong yet vulnerable woman on the brink of unraveling, facing unique circumstances and challenges that are universally-familiar. Themes of regret and redemption, loss, loyalty, loneliness, and risk vs. reward are explored as we journey through the gritty, dark shadows of the dangerous past which haunts Pepper's soul and drives her mission to find Mercy.</p>

<p>Until very recently, while it is fact women comprise more than half the world's population, our stories have remained in the background of popular culture, often under-told and considered irrelevant. But the tide is changing, and, with the Pilot, The Pepper Project sought to help lead the charge! Pepper: Ricochet aims similarly. Female-filmmakers now occupy a stunning proportion, producing outstanding indie-content. As a series, The Pepper Project furthers female-centric narratives in an underrepresented age group as well, serving as a heads-up to industry executives that stories about powerful mature women on the edge and messy verge of imperfection are important, essential and gaining ground with an enthusiastic following.</p>
<p><strong>INDUSTRY SPECS</strong></p>
<p>The world of digital series story-telling and streaming has literally EXPLODED in the past five years, and, fortunately, with our success, we're ideally-poised to continue to ride this crazy-wonderful wave of OTT enthusiasm. If you subscribe to Netflix, HBO, Amazon, or Hulu, AMC, Showtime and SeekaTV, you know these platforms are hungry and looking for more ORIGINAL content. We've had the meetings! We're on the HOT RADAR of several platforms that have expressed interest in Pepper's story. We need more content for distribution, to pitch, to remain cutting-edge and current in an extremely competitive market.

<p><strong>THE MONEY $$$</strong></p>
<p>The <strong>PEPPER RICOCHET</strong> chapter, approximately 15 minutes in length, films in two separate locations. One shoot is scheduled this summer at a beautiful outdoor lake-house which perfectly suits the scene to introduce Pepper's Godfather, Bald Sam. In the second phase, set to shoot this fall, we return to Pepper dangerously trapped in the stairwell.</p>

She is also technically a member of Undergraduate Student Government but quit going to meetings months ago.

<h3>HELP ME!</h3>
<p>Hey I'm Randy! I'm a grown up who's never smoked weed before and I've decided it's time! Depending on where you live, marijuana laws vary quite a bit. There is a general trend of decriminalization that eventually can lead to legalization in some form or another. But people are still getting arrested and put in jail for minor marijuana offenses. I want to see what marijuana is all about and finally smoke it for the first time, and I want to do it in the silliest way possible that will also highlight how inconsistent and silly the current state of marijuana legislation really is. </p>
<h3><strong>BUT WHO THE HELL AM I?</strong></h3>
<p>Here is a braggy bio that describes me in detail!</p>
<p>""Randy Liedtke is a Los Angeles based Stand Up Comedian, Actor, and Writer. He delivers a silly mix of strangely smart childish jokes and creative unorthodox bits. He makes both the absurd and surreal hilarious and somehow logical. In 2015 his Half Hour special on Comedy Central aired and his debut album on Comedy Central Records ""I'm on a Roll"" broke into the top ten on iTunes. He has also performed Stand Up on Conan, Late Night with Seth Meyers, Adam Devine's House Party, and Last ComicStanding.  LA Weekly named him one of 10 Comedy Acts to Watch in 2015 and the Village Voice said he's ""maddeningly great"". He was one of Comedy Central's Comics to Watch in 2013 and was a stand out at the prestigious Just For Laughs Festival in Montreal as part of the New Face showcase in 2014.  You may have seen him on Comedy Central's @midnight, IFC's Maron and Comedy Bang Bang, or heard his voice on Cartoon Network's Adventure Time.""</p>
<h3>RARE CHANCE!</h3>
<p>How often does a 33 year old comedian who's never used marijuana before, decide to do so on camera in a super weird convoluted way in the middle of the dessert? Not very often, and now you get to help make it happen! Please help me, it's an idea I've had for a while now and I really want to be able to share my first experience with as many people as possible. I'm even considering doubling down on first time experiences and getting my first tattoo, a marijuana leaf to commemorate my experience!</p>
<h3>WHAT WILL BE MADE?</h3>
<p>The final product will be a short form web documentary that is not only funny but creates a conversation. The goal is to have this shot, edited and released for you to watch on April 20th (4/20). Watch me plan the events that will take place. Watch my buy weed for the first time. Watch me prepare for every possible outcome. And watch me smoke for the first time ever. Will I freak out? Will nothing happen? Will I be a stereotypical stoner idiot who laughs at everything? Who knows!?</p>
<h3>UNIQUE!</h3>
<p>There's lots of information on the internet on how to smoke weed for the first time, and I'm guessing none of them suggest renting a limo, driving to where four different states borders meet, interviewing police officers, and then trying not to accidentally stumble across an imaginary line for fear of going to jail for 6 months. This will be unlike anyone's first experience and unlike anything that's ever been made.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>I NEED MONEY TO MAKE IT HAPPEN!</h3>
<p>I don't want to waste your money, I want to make this frugally, but I also want to do it justice and create something worth while. The more money I receive the better it will be. We want to shoot and finish this project faster than usual so we can release it on 4/20, so please donate and help out ASAP! Most of the money will go to travel expenses. I will need to fly myself, 2 crew members, and a friend who smokes a lot of weed with me to Colorado.  We will need hotel rooms, a rental car, and possibly a limo because that might be the only way to legally smoke weed in the parking lot of the monument. There are going to be lots of different obstacles to over come and being able to spend a few days in Colorado to make sure we have the time to not cut any corners will be very helpful. I need to be able to pay crew members to run camera and sound, and to direct and edit the final product. There is also talk of making a weed drone! I've said too much!

Hey I'm Randy! I'm a grown up who's never smoked weed before and I've decided it's time! Depending on where you live, marijuana laws vary quite a bit. There is a general trend of decriminalization that eventually can lead to legalization in some form or another. But people are still getting arrested and put in jail for minor marijuana offenses. I want to see what marijuana is all about and finally smoke it for the first time, and I want to do it in the silliest way possible that will also highlight how inconsistent and silly the current state of marijuana legislation really is. 
BUT WHO THE HELL AM I?
Here is a braggy bio that describes me in detail!
""Randy Liedtke is a Los Angeles based Stand Up Comedian, Actor, and Writer. He delivers a silly mix of strangely smart childish jokes and creative unorthodox bits. He makes both the absurd and surreal hilarious and somehow logical. In 2015 his Half Hour special on Comedy Central aired and his debut album on Comedy Central Records ""I'm on a Roll"" broke into the top ten on iTunes. He has also performed Stand Up on Conan, Late Night with Seth Meyers, Adam Devine's House Party, and Last ComicStanding.  LA Weekly named him one of 10 Comedy Acts to Watch in 2015 and the Village Voice said he's ""maddeningly great"". He was one of Comedy Central's Comics to Watch in 2013 and was a stand out at the prestigious Just For Laughs Festival in Montreal as part of the New Face showcase in 2014.  You may have seen him on Comedy Central's @midnight, IFC's Maron and Comedy Bang Bang, or heard his voice on Cartoon Network's Adventure Time.""
RARE CHANCE!
How often does a 33 year old comedian who's never used marijuana before, decide to do so on camera in a super weird convoluted way in the middle of the dessert? Not very often, and now you get to help make it happen! Please help me, it's an idea I've had for a while now and I really want to be able to share my first experience with as many people as possible. I'm even considering doubling down on first time experiences and getting my first tattoo, a marijuana leaf to commemorate my experience!
WHAT WILL BE MADE?
The final product will be a short form web documentary that is not only funny but creates a conversation. The goal is to have this shot, edited and released for you to watch on April 20th (4/20). Watch me plan the events that will take place. Watch my buy weed for the first time. Watch me prepare for every possible outcome. And watch me smoke for the first time ever. Will I freak out? Will nothing happen? Will I be a stereotypical stoner idiot who laughs at everything? Who knows!?
UNIQUE!
There's lots of information on the internet on how to smoke weed for the first time, and I'm guessing none of them suggest renting a limo, driving to where four different states borders meet, interviewing police officers, and then trying not to accidentally stumble across an imaginary line for fear of going to jail for 6 months. This will be unlike anyone's first experience and unlike anything that's ever been made.

I NEED MONEY TO MAKE IT HAPPEN!
I don't want to waste your money, I want to make this frugally, but I also want to do it justice and create something worth while. The more money I receive the better it will be. We want to shoot and finish this project faster than usual so we can release it on 4/20, so please donate and help out ASAP! Most of the money will go to travel expenses. I will need to fly myself, 2 crew members, and a friend who smokes a lot of weed with me to Colorado.  We will need hotel rooms, a rental car, and possibly a limo because that might be the only way to legally smoke weed in the parking lot of the monument. There are going to be lots of different obstacles to over come and being able to spend a few days in Colorado to make sure we have the time to not cut any corners will be very helpful. I need to be able to pay crew members to run camera and sound, and to direct and edit the final product. There is also talk of making a weed drone! I've said too much! Please donate so you can see what happens!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
</div></div>
<p>My name is Andrea Ridgeway. I was born in Phoenix, Arizona and studied Theatre/Drama at Arizona State University. Since I’ve moved to Los Angeles to pursue my acting career I have done fifteen short films, three television pilots, two web-series, one play, and countless comedic sketches featured on my Youtube Channel. I directed my first short film last year at the Collaboration Filmmakers Challenge where I was awarded the “Collaborator Award”. I have studied improvisation at Second City and The Groundlings, along with scene study at Ivana Chubbuck Studios. Feel free to check out my website <a href=""http://www.andrearidgeway.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.andrearidgeway.com</a>. Over the years I have consistently written myself content from sketches to commercials, a feature, and now this series, my favorite: The Many Addictions of Chloe.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1499839999/phpdhzjfsn1hq19jbtgn.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>After nearly six years of pursuing my acting career here I have realized that it’s not just acting that is important to me. I live my life by the quote“If your dreams don’t scare you they aren’t big enough”. I have aspirations to do enormous things with my life and very few of them are small. To name a few: Becoming President, building homeless shelters, speaking out on a massive scale about the benefits of living a plant-based life/diet, and more! But I digress. I am telling you this so you know more about who I am deep down. So you know that I really care about other people, animals, and our planet. This campaign is a step in the direction to where I need to go to do bigger, better things for not only my life but other people’s lives as well.</p>
<p>This campaign is to help me raise funds to create a very high quality pilot that is executed extremely well. Top executives at production companies and digital platform companies have said that right now they are looking for <u>content that is WELL EXECUTED</u>, even if it does not have an all-star cast. If the acting, script, editing, direction, and all of the various components are executed well this series CAN GO PLACES. I believe that this series is unique, funny, and can be successful if we can start off with an amazing pilot.</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Your financial assistance will help fund our pilot, including paying half a dozen actors and about twice as many crew. Even a small shoot requires a director, camera operators, lighting and sound technicians, continuity, set decorators, make-up, craft services, transportation, equipment rentals, and insurance. Post production expenses include an editor, soundtrack music, music licensing (a very crucial element to this series), sound mixing, color grading and titles. We’ll be producing under Ultra Low Budget SAG New Media. Our budget may be shoestring, but we do things right.</p>
<p>My cast/crew may need to take time away from their survival job to be on my set so they must be paid; a small but reasonable amount for the work. I will also have professionals on set that do film-making full-time therefore, they cannot say “yes” to my project unless I am paying. This project allows everyone to get one step closer to fulfilling their creative dreams.</p>
<p>Are YOU an artist working in a restaurant or a corporate cubicle? Let us help you get that artistic relief that you’ve been needing when you join us at the $200, $300, or $350 contribution levels. Work on set, be an actor for a day, for $750 you can be an associate producer, and for $1000 you can have lunch with Chloe and many other perks!</p>
<p>Is that a little out of your price range? How about a copy of the series, complete with exclusive special features? A cool t-shirt that proclaims your support? A signed poster? A cute pen? We've got you covered. A contribution at any level will get you a sneak preview of <i>The Many Addictions of Chloe</i> – prior to its release to the public!</p>
<p>Remember, art of all kinds is an important aspect of civilization. The world needs you!</p>
<p>Our plan is in place, scripts are polished, the cast is excited, and so are we. We are good to go and all we need is the rest of the funding.</p>
<p>And if you cannot contribute financially, you can still help by telling your friends and sharing on social media. Help us spread the word, and you get that undying gratitude we mentioned.</p>
<p>Any amount helps. Seriously. Anything.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p>This project is immensely important to me. I have developed this series over the last two years and it is finally polished and ready to film. This series came about from my struggle with addiction which inspired me to help others to seek help as well. I have “an addictive personality” but I am lucky enough to be able to manage my life and control these tendencies. Other people whose lives are overtaken with addiction aren’t so lucky. We all know someone who suffers from some form of addiction and most of the time there is very little we can actually do to help them. At the end of every episode there will be a website or phone number to encourage people to seek help for themselves or others.</p>
<p>Although Chloe sometimes becomes addicted to things that are seemingly innocent or harmless, she comes close to destroying her own life in every episode. This series shows the severity of addiction in a way that is easier to bear than the grueling reality of other harsher substances.</p>
<p>I am extremely organized and detail oriented. Last year I ran a very smooth shoot when I directed my first short film. I was efficient with my time and had an extremely talented cast/crew that made everything turn out successful. The shoot for The Many Addictions of Chloe will be ran with very high standards so that we can develop top quality results. In addition to that I have been professionally acting for 14 years so I am very familiar with how to make this a successful production.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I promise to be open and honest to all of the fans and contributors to this project. If I cannot raise the necessary budget to shoot the pilot then the entire project will be delayed until further funding is raised. I know where my strengths and weaknesses lie so I am well equipped to face any obstacles that comes my way. For example, I know I don’t have a celebrity cast but I have an incredibly talented cast/crew, along with a fantastic script that will make this appealing when I try to “shop” this series around. I have a strong network of professional filmmakers that I can tap into for any resource, question, or issue that comes up.</p>

More to Gain: The NYC Women's Fund
2k helps us hire women and other PoC to film, edit & produce our scripts for submission to the NYC Women's Fund. With a solid application, we are eligible for up to 20k in grant funding. But we're only asking for 2k for our submission.  We are not waiting on grant money to make our show. We've already begun.
We've been meeting and writing sketches since May. We're filming every weekend in September. We edit in October. ""I Feel Funny"" premieres October 31st at the Magnet Theater in NYC (at 7pm).

<h3>Short Summary: </h3>
<p>Rachel and Jaz connected in 2013 via a giant Twitter rant about horror films and gay people. They have been besties ever since. Rachel is a big ol' lesbian who has been drinking and acting regularly since the tender age of 21. Jaz started her directing career with a Panasonic Hi-8 camcorder that her moms bought her at a garage sale in the boonies.  With their powers combined,<i> Drink Responsibly</i> was born.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1508356216/jnyb4bj1vlwcba4foe4t.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Jaz and Rachel shot the first several episodes on a shoestring budget in the Valley.  Working tirelessly over the past year-and-a-half, they have found their voice.  This show encompasses a world of drunken debauchery and shenanigans through interviews, games and audience interaction. Every episode, host Rachel teaches a celebrity guest how to concoct a different craft cocktail. They sit down, enjoy the fruits of their labor and with lowered inhibitions, interview one another. All participants are over 21.</p>
<h3>What They Need:</h3>
<p>Although impressed with what they were able to accomplish with nearly nothing, Rachel and Jaz know the show could be EVEN better. Past episodes were shot in Jaz's un-airconditioned apartment with paper thin walls and second-hand equipment. With more funds, they would be able to <strong>rent a studio or find a more comfortably convenient shooting location. </strong>And quite possibly, even<strong> get equipment that doesn't require frozen peas to stay cool/function!</strong></p>
<p> As many of you know, <strong>alcohol is expensive</strong> (especially in LA) so previous cocktails were simple. Rachel is a trained mixologist with over ten years of experience and she needs the proper tools to do her thing. There are so many elements to building a good cocktail: glassware, liqueurs, garnishes, cordials, aperitifs, digestifs, shakers, muddlers, mixers...ice. With a contribution, you can help make that happen!</p>
<p>Other expenses they need funding for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Crew</strong> (maybe people other than just them,)<strong> </strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Food </strong>(to soak up all the alcohol,) <strong> </strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Traveling</strong> (gotta make sure everyone gets home safe,) </li>
<li>
<strong>Set design </strong>(perhaps props NOT from Dollar Tree,)<strong>  </strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Post-production</strong> (Jaz never sleeps,)  </li>
<li>
<strong>Wardrobe</strong> (Rachel currently only owns black,) </li>

<h3>STORY</h3>
<p><strong>We make eye contact across a crowded room...</strong></p>
<p>...Frankie walks into a crowded party with her best friend Kate, who encourages her to put herself out there, but Frankie's cruel inner monologue undercuts her at every turn. She tries to talk to guys (<i>wearing that outfit?</i>) and even runs into her unrequited crush (<i>he didn't choose her</i>), all with embarrassing results. Transitioning into her ""new life"" may be harder than she thought. </p>
<p><strong>New body, same problems.  </strong></p>
<p>Body image is a problem everyone struggles with, especially when it comes to dating. Our waists could be smaller, our stomachs flatter, our butts bigger. The list goes on. Frankie Falls In Love serves as an exploration of the idea that changing our bodies won't change our lives-- we'll be the same people regardless of our appearance. It's important for us to accept ourselves as we are.</p>
<p><strong>Now, who am I?</strong></p>
<p>I'm Octavia Bray and I am the writer/director of Frankie Falls In Love.

I am also fat and single (tell your friends)!</p>
<p>I am asking that you contribute funds to this project to help bring Frankie's story to life in a way that will provide a platform to continue the conversation on body image and self-esteem. Together with my exceedingly talented  producer, cinematographer, production designers, grips, sound mixers, and so many more we hope to create a series that is not only fun but thought provoking, relatable, and inspiring.</p>

We make eye contact across a crowded room...
...Frankie walks into a crowded party with her best friend Kate, who encourages her to put herself out there, but Frankie's cruel inner monologue undercuts her at every turn. She tries to talk to guys (wearing that outfit?) and even runs into her unrequited crush (he didn't choose her), all with embarrassing results. Transitioning into her ""new life"" may be harder than she thought. 
New body, same problems.  
Body image is a problem everyone struggles with, especially when it comes to dating. Our waists could be smaller, our stomachs flatter, our butts bigger. The list goes on. Frankie Falls In Love serves as an exploration of the idea that changing our bodies won't change our lives-- we'll be the same people regardless of our appearance. It's important for us to accept ourselves as we are.
Now, who am I?
I'm Octavia Bray and I am the writer/director of Frankie Falls In Love. I am a third-year graduate student at Loyola Marymount University, the showrunner's assistant on BoJack Horseman, and a member of the 2017-2018 NBC Writer's on the Verge Program. I am also fat and single (tell your friends)!
I am asking that you contribute funds to this project to help bring Frankie's story to life in a way that will provide a platform to continue the conversation on body image and self-esteem. Together with my exceedingly talented  producer, cinematographer, production designers, grips, sound mixers, and so many more we hope to create a series that is not only fun but thought provoking, relatable, and inspiring.

<p>Who We Are: ""Driven"" Created and Directed by Stephen Elliott</p>
<p>Stephen Elliott is the creator/director of the scripted web series “Driven.” He is the founder of the popular literary magazine <i>The Rumpus</i> and the author of 8 books including <i>The Adderall Diaries </i>and <i>Happy Baby</i>. His first movie “About Cherry” premiered at the Berlinale and was released by IFC in 2012. In 2013, he filmed an adaptation of his novel “Happy Baby.” His newest movie “After Adderall” was the closing night feature at Slamdance Film Festival in 2017.  His latest mini web series, ""Driven"" is about a writer, Paul who has writer’s block and drives a Panda car. Stories center around the diverse riders who come and go from his car. “Driven” episodes are flashes of 10-15 minute episodes that contain the clashing agendas of his customers and the culture in which we live—the detours, the hassles, stoned cops and custody battles over cats as well as prickly intimacies between strangers and lovers.  </p>
<p>Episode ""Poppy"" Written by Antonia Crane</p>
<p>Antonia Crane is the author of the memoir, “Spent” (Barnacle Books, Rare Bird Lit). She is a performer and writing instructor in Los Angeles. She has written for The New York Times, The Believer, The Toast, Playboy, Cosmopolitan, Salon.com, The Rumpus, Electric Literature, DAME, The Los Angeles Review, Quartz: The Atlantic Media, Medium.com, Buzzfeed, Medium.com, The Establishment and lots of other places. Her screenplay “The Lusty” (co-written by Transparent director, writer Silas Howard), based on the true story of the exotic dancer’s labor union, is a recipient of the San Francisco Film Society/Kenneth Rainin Foundation Grant in screenwriting. She has appeared on CNN’s This is Life With Lisa Ling and has been interviewed on WTF with Marc Maron and Michael Smerconish on <a href=""https://www.siriusxm.com/potus"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.siriusxm.com/potus</a> where he compared dancers to Uber drivers. She may be the oldest living stripper.</p>
<p><strong>Summery Narrative of Episode “Poppy”</strong></p>
<p>A beautifully world-weary Veteran dancer played by Breeda Wool leaves her day shift at the lap dancing club and hops in a Panda car to go home, but her shift is far from over. Instead of going home, she meets her decade-long regular client, Colin at his McMansion for their routine oral sex session but Colin tries to push the limits of their relationship. Colin has competing addictions and other sex worker “friends” who meet Poppy with conspiratorial sass. The ""Poppy"" episode explores the connection between desire and commerce: Where do the lines blur between long term clients and friendship and is contentment possible within conflicting desires? </p>

<h3>Assassin's League</h3>
<p>Hi, I am Cory Gerard, creator of this amazing project. My producers, Shawna McGill and Stephane Legault and I have been around this crazy world of entertainment for many years. All working on major projects. I, myself have worked on a few sets as both an actor and the ever fun background actor. I have created, written, directed and produced many other indie films and web series. Shawna, as an actor has appeared in many films and T.V. shows, including a principle role on the T.V. show Wynonna Earp and Netflix hit Black Summer as both actor and stunt person. Stephane Legault, while also appearing in many T.V. shows and films, like The Revenant with Leonardo DiCaprio, is a very accomplished director, producer and contractor. Many projects both in Canada and the U.S. when coming to Calgary, look to Stephane to build their sets. </p>
<p>Our project. Assassin's League is such an amazing idea and script.</p>
<p>- A former C.I.A. black ops agent gets brought out of retirement to hunt down a rogue assassin who has started a league that will change the face of the free world. One way or another. </p>
<p>Five years after retiring from the C.I.A. to take care of his newly found out daughter, Derek Lawrence receives a visit from his mentor and main handler, now Deputy Direct of the C.I.A. Jack Riley. Jack reveals to Derek that one of his targets eight years ago, a worlds top assassin and assassin recruiter, is still alive and has created a league of international assassins. This league consists of twenty of the worlds best. The assassins are paired off into groups and each group assigned a target. The first assassin to hit their target moves onto the next round. All targets are leaders of countries with freedom. The ""World Series Trophy"" being the president of the United States. In complete disbelief, Derek declines, but after much thought he starts to realize that this newly formed ""League"" is just a cover and that maybe something much deeper is going on. Reluctantly he decides to take this into his own hands. But first, he must start to round up all his former assets like Elsa Cooper. A hard nosed no nonsense former Navy S.E.A.L. One of the first women to ever serve as a S.E.A.L. Asan Rohit, former Mossad agent who refuses to kill innocent people but quick on the trigger to those he deems guilty.  Pete Conner,  a current C.I.A. agent who Derek himself recruited many years ago and saved from a terror camp after Pete had been captured. Calm, cool and collected, Pete always gets the job done and is extremely loyal to Derek. As well as many other agents from other intelligence agencies from around the world.  </p>
<p>With Soriya McInnis, C.I.A station chief, and her team of analysts at the helm trying to figure out what this is all about, Derek and his team travel the world to hunt down this rogue assassin known as Alexander Lindgren. Time is not on their side. </p>
<p>With your help, we can take this project to the next level. With proper funding we will able to hire Alberta based crew and pay our wonderful actors. We have filmed a proof of concept with a ZERO budget. ZERO crew. Yes ZERO. Our crew consisted of our wonderful cast doing everything behind the scenes and all on a volunteer basis. We believe this project has the potential to be taken to that next level. And funding will allow us to put together an incredible pilot in order to make that next level. Most importantly, it will employ many actors and crew.  Keep Alberta Rolling.  Keep everyone rolling.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We are looking for $150,000 to be able to bring you an amazing product. These funds will go into production and being able to hire an amazing crew. Funds will go towards new equipment and top of the line equipment rental. Funds will go towards booking amazing location spots around Alberta. Funds will go towards paying our amazing actors who have been putting in countless volunteer hours over the course of the last three years. And lastly funds will go towards promotions and festivals to be sure we can get the right eyes on this amazing project</p>

</div></div>","Assassin's League
Hi, I am Cory Gerard, creator of this amazing project. My producers, Shawna McGill and Stephane Legault and I have been around this crazy world of entertainment for many years. All working on major projects. I, myself have worked on a few sets as both an actor and the ever fun background actor. I have created, written, directed and produced many other indie films and web series. Shawna, as an actor has appeared in many films and T.V. shows, including a principle role on the T.V. show Wynonna Earp and Netflix hit Black Summer as both actor and stunt person. Stephane Legault, while also appearing in many T.V. shows and films, like The Revenant with Leonardo DiCaprio, is a very accomplished director, producer and contractor. Many projects both in Canada and the U.S. when coming to Calgary, look to Stephane to build their sets. 
Our project. Assassin's League is such an amazing idea and script.
- A former C.I.A. black ops agent gets brought out of retirement to hunt down a rogue assassin who has started a league that will change the face of the free world. One way or another. 
Five years after retiring from the C.I.A. to take care of his newly found out daughter, Derek Lawrence receives a visit from his mentor and main handler, now Deputy Direct of the C.I.A. Jack Riley. Jack reveals to Derek that one of his targets eight years ago, a worlds top assassin and assassin recruiter, is still alive and has created a league of international assassins. This league consists of twenty of the worlds best. The assassins are paired off into groups and each group assigned a target. The first assassin to hit their target moves onto the next round. All targets are leaders of countries with freedom. The ""World Series Trophy"" being the president of the United States. In complete disbelief, Derek declines, but after much thought he starts to realize that this newly formed ""League"" is just a cover and that maybe something much deeper is going on. Reluctantly he decides to take this into his own hands. But first, he must start to round up all his former assets like Elsa Cooper. A hard nosed no nonsense former Navy S.E.A.L. One of the first women to ever serve as a S.E.A.L. Asan Rohit, former Mossad agent who refuses to kill innocent people but quick on the trigger to those he deems guilty.  Pete Conner,  a current C.I.A. agent who Derek himself recruited many years ago and saved from a terror camp after Pete had been captured. Calm, cool and collected, Pete always gets the job done and is extremely loyal to Derek. As well as many other agents from other intelligence agencies from around the world.  
With Soriya McInnis, C.I.A station chief, and her team of analysts at the helm trying to figure out what this is all about, Derek and his team travel the world to hunt down this rogue assassin known as Alexander Lindgren. Time is not on their side. 
With your help, we can take this project to the next level. With proper funding we will able to hire Alberta based crew and pay our wonderful actors. We have filmed a proof of concept with a ZERO budget. ZERO crew. Yes ZERO. Our crew consisted of our wonderful cast doing everything behind the scenes and all on a volunteer basis. We believe this project has the potential to be taken to that next level. And funding will allow us to put together an incredible pilot in order to make that next level. Most importantly, it will employ many actors and crew.  Keep Alberta Rolling.  Keep everyone rolling.

What We Need & What You Get
We are looking for $150,000 to be able to bring you an amazing product. These funds will go into production and being able to hire an amazing crew. Funds will go towards new equipment and top of the line equipment rental. Funds will go towards booking amazing location spots around Alberta. Funds will go towards paying our amazing actors who have been putting in countless volunteer hours over the course of the last three years. And lastly funds will go towards promotions and festivals to be sure we can get the right eyes on this amazing project

<h2><u>THE IMPACT</u></h2>
<p>Stories of immigrants are more vital than ever. In our current political climate we desperately need to bring these unique voices to light. In highlighting a show about illegal immigration with a light and humorous touch, we hope to create points of connection between different minded people. We want anyone, regardless of their personal beliefs to be able to laugh and see themselves in this story. At it's core this story is about fitting in. Who can't relate to that? </p>
<h2><u>WHO WE ARE</u></h2>
<p><strong>​Shayan Shojaee- (Actor/Executive Producer/Co-Writer) </strong>A native Iranian, Shayan was raised in South Carolina since the early age of ten. He is an award winning actor (2nd place-Best Supporting Actor in a high school production of <i>Scapino</i>).  Feeling the need to facade his true identity in his youth, he took shelter in many theatrical playhouses. He is a man of many masks. He has experienced an adventurous transition adjusting to a new culture and way of life. As a professional actor he has appeared in <i>Madam Secretary</i>,  <i>Elementary</i>, <i>Unforgettable,</i> <i>Jessica Jones</i> &amp; <i>Veep</i>. His original sketches which he co-wrote and starred in, have also been featured on Funny or Die!</p>

As a director/writer, he has developed, written, shot &amp; edited countless sketches, several of which have been featured on Funny or Die! He is currently in pre-production on his first full length feature entitled <i>Swell. </i></p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>As I said, I am an independent writer and producer of mini series, and as I go on working on other people's productions, I wanted to work on a story I want to tell.  As my debut project, I want to make sure I do everything possible to make this as successful as possible </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>So, not going to lie, we need about 5,000 dollars for filming, it will break down as follows:  </p>
<p>$1000: Proper Director of Photography, so what I have written comes out looking sleek, and the visuals can match the comedic tone of the series as much as possible.  This will also be a part of the VFX/editing budget  </p>
<p>$750: This will go to the stars of the show: the actors! I want to be able to pay them   </p>
<p>$250-300: Audio engineer/ sound guy:  Anyone would tell you good sound can make or break a production.  Also want to pay a guy to compose a score and theme song for the show!     </p>
<p>Most of the other budget will go towards the day to day catering, transportation, and other unforeseen production circumstances such as: </p>
<p>-Production tools may malfunction   </p>
<p>-Locations may fall through, prolonging shooting in which case, we may need to further compensate the important people involved. </p>
<p>-Weather can delay or hinder production days, which refers back to the problem above! </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>You agree that this is an awesome idea, and you're super excited to get to watch the finished series, because you have great taste. However, now you must be wondering, who is she and why should I trust her to actually follow through with something so insane?</p>
<p>I graduated from SUNY Purchase with a BFA in filmmaking in 2015. Since then I have traveled to 20 countries in between working in art direction and post production for a major web media company, all while producing and directing my own short documentary pieces while I travel. This project means the world to me (well, at least 10,000 miles of it) and nothing will stop me from making it to the finish line, with hundreds of hours of amazing women's stories on video in tow.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>We are trying to raise at least $20,000. This will cover:<ul>
<li>Transportation to London</li>
<li>Food, accommodation and camping equipment</li>
<li>Gas, car repairs, bribes, etc.</li>
<li>Visas</li>
<li>Additional equipment (little portable lights for interviews, better sound equipment, go pros for strapping to the hood of the car, etc.)</li>
<li>Transportation home (because we do unfortunately have to come back, eventually)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We want to get you involved in the adventure as much as possible, and we've created our perks with this in mind. Whether it's surprise souvenirs from the road, access to additional behind the scenes content, or the ability to choose some of what gets painted on our car, there are lots of great ways to be a part of the team.</li>
<li>If we don't make quite enough to be able to take the trip and get the series done, we will be very very sad. However, all of your money will go directly to Girls Not Brides, so it's really a win win either way.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>This past year has been a rough one for everyone. It can be so hard to wake up in the morning and feel good about the world we live in. We're bombarded with horror stories, fake news, endless hate, you name it. We want this series to serve as a little bit of light in the darkness, without trying to pretend the darkness doesn't exist. We won't sugar coat the stories we find or our experiences in the countries we visit. We will, however, be on a mission to find the goodness, find the hope, find the opportunity on the other side of all this darkness. </li>
<li>I spent the majority of 2017 traveling through Eastern Europe producing and shooting documentaries on my own on a variety of subjects. I worked on pieces about a forest fire and the effects on the environment and the community in Greece, the homelessness epidemic left behind by the rapid post-Communist shift to a global economy in Romania, a group of children who have to walk three hours (each way) up and down a mountain every day just to get to school in Albania, and many more. Finding, documenting, and sharing stories is my favorite way to create stories, making this the perfect adventure for me.</li>
<li>Some of these docs will (finally!) be released during the campaign, so be sure to keep an eye open for them!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Obviously, this journey is not without peril. The unpredictability is a large part of why this is such an excellent adventure, but of course that also means there's a fair amount of room for danger. We are almost guaranteed to break down in inconvenient places and get lost again and again and again. We could get robbed, we could get into a car accident, we could get bitten by a giant poisonous spider in the desert when we set up camp for the evening. I am not worried about any of these things, and you shouldn't be either.</p>
<ul>
<li>In my experience, people are mostly good. The amount of times I've been in a foreign country totally lost, with everything I own strapped to my back and no handle of the local language (or real idea of where I was) and been helped out by a kind stranger have forced me to accept that more often than not, people are kind. My past travel experiences have equipped me to be able to handle any situation that comes my way.</li>
<li>In a lot of the countries we will be driving through, the US dollar can go a long way. Money can't buy happiness but in a lot of instances, it can buy safety.</li>
<li>We will be traveling with multiple backup cameras, sound recorders, hard drives and edit machines, so we always have a back up in the event that something essential is broken or stolen. We also will not be keeping all the equipment in the same place, ever. (For example, if we are carrying a camera or two around, we will leave back ups in the car.)</li>

<p style=""text-align: center;"">Hello ! </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I'm Magpie, full time self-employed artist, I've previously worked on shows such as <strong>Hazbin Hotel</strong> and <strong>Holidaze</strong>, and done a lot of freelance art work.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">I've always taken time to also develop my own projects, and this time I decided to take it a step further and develop a 4 mins short film with an amazing team of people, most of which whom I've met through my time in the Hazbin Hotel team and online career.<br/><br/><strong>Villains &amp; Co</strong> will be a 2D animated film, with fully hand painted backgrounds (yes, with good old paints and brushes !), about several super villains entering a contest to prove who can be the most evil. <br/>The short film will be targetting more of an adult audience, as there will be some cartoon violence/gore.<br/><br/>With your help, I would be able to push this project even further in quality and put more of my free time into focusing on painting all those backgrounds and directing the team. Art, and especially animation, takes a lot of time and dedication, and with some extra funds, we could really push the quality of the film and make it a better experience for everyone, both viewers and artists part of the team !<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Our goal would be to raise £3000.

</div></div>","What is the project ?
Hello ! 
I'm Magpie, full time self-employed artist, I've previously worked on shows such as Hazbin Hotel and Holidaze, and done a lot of freelance art work.
 

 
I've always taken time to also develop my own projects, and this time I decided to take it a step further and develop a 4 mins short film with an amazing team of people, most of which whom I've met through my time in the Hazbin Hotel team and online career.Villains & Co will be a 2D animated film, with fully hand painted backgrounds (yes, with good old paints and brushes !), about several super villains entering a contest to prove who can be the most evil. The short film will be targetting more of an adult audience, as there will be some cartoon violence/gore.With your help, I would be able to push this project even further in quality and put more of my free time into focusing on painting all those backgrounds and directing the team. Art, and especially animation, takes a lot of time and dedication, and with some extra funds, we could really push the quality of the film and make it a better experience for everyone, both viewers and artists part of the team ! 

What We Need & What You Get
Our goal would be to raise £3000. Any extra funds we might get if we exceed our goal would go right to our hard working artists in the team, and would help the project even further !Now, what if we DON'T meet our goal ; have no fear, because the project is still going to get made. The final deadline for our project is early March 28th. If we don't meet our goal, I will make sure to work extra hard in my freelance job to bring in the extra funds, however it would mean that I sadly wouldn't have as much time to put into Villains & Co.
Now about those perks ! The one I'm the most excited about is to offer you guys the opportunity to purchase some of the ORIGINAL hand painted backgrounds from the film ! 

(there will be limited stock however, and first one there first served, so if you want some of the coolest ones, you might want to grab it quickly !)I will also be printing A4 sized prints, and postcards with artworks from the film. I will be showing you some behind the scene work in progress, send hand written notes and more !
 
Here are the backgrounds currently available ! We'll keep adding more as we continue production :)
 

The Impact
Why is our project important ?I have true passion for art and 2D animation. I want to continue making online films and show everyone that yes, a team of passionate hard working animators can make it ! 
Working on the amazing Hazbin Hotel pilote and seeing its success has immensely inspired me, and made me feel like I should start my own project too, and I hope that maybe my project could inspire more people to do the same too 
 

Risks & Challenges
Every animated film faces some bumps in the road at one point or the other, however, I have some experience in animation and films myself, and have been part of art teams before, so I'm quite confident that I can make sure Villains & Co will be completed in time and of great quality.If the animation takes longer than expected, I will make sure to work even harder, and invest some of my personal money to bring in extra artists in the team and make sure that the deadline is met ! 

Other Ways You Can Help
You can help by following our official Twitter at @Villains_Co and share the work in progress and updates we consistently post on there, and share the film once it's released !Sharing may only be a click of a button, but for us it truly means the world and helps more than you think !

<h3>Why</h3>
<p>2020 was a year with a lot of surprises. A lot of these surprises caused a lot of pain. You worried about being safe, and keeping the people around you safe. A lot of you <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/oct/29/coronavirus-pandemic-americans-gun-sales"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">bought guns</a>. You wondered about what would happen if the people and large groups who take care of you decided not to take care of you.</p>
<p>We are here to show how you can learn to take care of yourself and the people around you through training to fight. Training to fight trains your mind to be safe. We're not experts, so we believe that if we can learn to do it in front of you, you can do it too. The more you know about fighting, the better able you will be to avoid fighting. Training to fight through play is the best way to train to fight. Play is a strong <a href=""https://openai.com/blog/competitive-self-play/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">form </a><a href=""https://www.journalofplay.org/sites/www.journalofplay.org/files/pdf-articles/5-3-interview-play-as-preparation.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">of</a> <a href=""https://www.marines.mil/News/Publications/MCPEL/Electronic-Library-Display/Article/2129863/mcdp-7/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">learning</a>, and through playing out what could happen in very bad times, you will be less surprised if you are ever in bad times.</p>
<p>You may train to fight by yourself, like hitting a bag, but training by yourself will not help you learn how to avoid getting hit by someone else while trying to hit them. To do that, you need to train with others in an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliveness_(martial_arts)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">always-changing contest</a>. We will learn how to do this in the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">open</a>, so you may learn from us learning.</p>
<p>At the moment, there is no shared way of speaking about what we learn from training to fight. Armies and police have this, but only for their members.  We aim to develop a language and a way of training that anyone, anywhere can use to learn how to fight in small groups.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What </h3>
<p>Arm Your Mind (AYM) will be delivered as a web series, a database, and a community- all so you may join us in developing a method collaboratively that we will share with the rest of the world. While the sports of airsoft and paintball provide similar instruction, they do not distribute information with regard to testing principles which you may use in everyday life- <i>we will</i>. </p>
<h3>How</h3>
<p>Things we will learn include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tactical operations (terrain appreciation, urban warfare, navigation, avoiding friendly fire, etc)</li>
<li>Medical emergency response</li>
<li>Operational security</li>
<li>Communication </li>
<li>Evacuation</li>
<li>Group dynamics</li>
</ul>
<p>To test our training exercises and record our process, we're going to need simulated weapons, radios, medical equipment, and an action cam. We're going to do this whether we get funding or not, but without you, we're probably going to take years to find the time and resources required to get this program going. And without you, we're not going to learn as much as we will learn with you (through feedback from and collaboration with you, our community). </p>
<h3>Who</h3>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ul><li><strong>$6740</strong></li></ul>
<p>Most of the money at our initial target will go toward a lasertag system. We've selected lasertag due to the ease at which we can use such systems without damaging our training environment (as in airsoft, paintball, or simunition) and incurring additional costs. While some systems with a range of 100m are available for US$350++ per rifle (such as those manufactured by Battle Company), systems that aim to replicate weapons tend to cost $1550-1700 per rifle (such as those manufactured by iCombat). Most vendors offer quotes directly to businesses, and the systems we'll be able to purchase (and the prices we will get) depend on our budget.  Other purchases include dual-band two-way radios ($24 per radio), medical equipment (such as tourniquets, combat gauze, and medical tape), a GoPro Hero8 Black (&amp; assorted accessories), simulation equipment (for IEDs, wounds, and other complications), and access to varied environments. If we fail to meet this target, we will prioritize a minimum viable lasertag system and camera (such as a Polaroid cube). </p>
<ul><li><strong>$15,000</strong></li></ul>
<p>At this target, we'll be able to guarantee the use of lasertag systems that are designed to simulate weapons. In addition, we will be able to afford expert feedback at a distance.</p>
<ul><li><strong>$25,000</strong></li></ul>
<p>We'll be able to purchase expert feedback in-person and a full <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_training_exercise#:~:text=A%20field%20training%20exercise%2C%20generally,military%20units%20for%20training%20purposes."" rel=""noopener nofollow"">field training exercise</a>, including actors to play a hostile-but-nonviolent group to get everyone used to de-escalation. In addition, we'll include feedback from an intelligence expert on counter-surveillance and operational security techniques.</p>
<ul><li><strong>$35,000</strong></li></ul>
<p>We'll apply the same principles we explore to historical combat paradigms. Our primary focus will be on raiding party tactics common to small-scale societies. Employing shorter spears, knives, swords, axes, bows, clubs, and slings, we will compare ancient Greek sources, Roman sources, Norse 9th-11th century sources, as well as Maori, Aztec, Guinean, Amazonian, Bornean, and Zulu accounts. Using this exploration, we'll draw parallels between modern squad tactics and these raiding tactics.</p>
<ul><li><strong>$45,000</strong></li></ul>
<p>We'll travel to get feedback from experts in different paradigms. For instance, if we receive expert feedback from someone with mountainous or urban combat experience at the $25,000 level, we'll get expert feedback from someone with desert or amphibious experience at this level. </p>
<ul><li><strong>$52,000++</strong></li></ul>
<p>This was always about involving you, so with funds past this point we'll travel to those among you who'd like to join us in establishing teams that will lead the way. We'll provide equipment, and guide you on nurturing your local community- which is our true aim.</p>

<h3>FACADE</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Rachelle Henry! I have been in the film industry for over a decade and I am passionate about cinema. From the time I was a little kid, I was always creating stories and bringing characters to life. Now as a filmmaker, I can tell my stories and share them with audiences around the world. I love action and excitement in films as well as intimacy and simplicity in emotional dramas. I love making movies/series that tap into my audiences emotions and have them laughing &amp; crying. FACADE explores humanity by diving into the consequences of choices people make, our relationships to one another, and our own self-identity. </p>
<p>When a criminal justice student is tasked to go undercover to prevent the deaths of vulnerable youth, she uncovers dark family secrets, conspiracies, and lies from those she loves most. </p>
<p>FACADE is a gritty show the revolves around an atmospheric world of the criminal justice system, the scientific world of medicine, and the dark undergrounds of crime. It features clever dialogue, fast-paced action and unique characters whose true colors are about to be revealed. We all wear a façade, it's the secrets we hide that truly define us. </p>
<p>This series is Extreme Measures meets Bloodline with a touch The Fall, a splash of Dark and a bite of Hannibal. The tone is similar to the works of Christopher Nolan, David Fincher, and Stanley Kubrick. </p>
</div><div><p>Our financial goal for FACADE is $20,000. All of the funds go toward making and launching the FACADE Series. Production costs include paying the cast &amp; crew, equipment rentals, locations, location permits, catering/craft services, transportation, post production, editing, composer etc. </p></div><div>
<p>You're contribution to this campaign is greatly appreciated and anything you can give helps! Be sure and spread the word about FACADE and it's amazing team!

<h2>ABOUT BINGE MEDIA </h2>
<p><a href=""http://www.bingemedia.net"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>BingeMedia.net</strong></a> is a podcast network created by Jim Law and Alyx Ancira (aka Moreno), former hosts of the JoBlo Movie Podcast.  More than that though, Binge Media is in a sense a community of like-minded movie fans who like to get together, talk a little trash and lay out their opinions.  Law and Moreno, with their staff of Binge co-hosts, deliver 2-5 podcasts a week detailing a range of topics including movies, music, television, video gaming, sports and comics.  Binge Media is the only place you can find the BingeCast, Binge GameCast, Monday Morning Moreno, Wake &amp; Bake with Bob Ross, Small Screen Heroes, Binge Aftertaste, Binge SportsCast, Binge Movie and TV commentaries and more.  With their unique, barroom approach to all topics, the guys have accrued over 700 shows in the span of a little under five years.  You’d be hard pressed to find many podcasts out there who have dedicated themselves to the volume of content that Binge Media has, and the momentum continues to build as fans get involved in the content and find unique ways to contribute to the site. </p>

<h2>ABOUT THIS PROJECT </h2>
<p>As the site expands and the listenership and community grows, one thing we have always talked about is creating our own animated series ala the Ricky Gervais podcast.  The content itself is based on irreverent conversations between BingeCast hosts Law, Moreno and Ammon Gilbert about film and TV.  With your help, Indiegogo, we can make that dream a reality. With your contributions, we are planning on creating an entire first season of the Binge Media Animated Series ""Better Call Binge"", but to do that we have to cover software and labor costs. Projects such as this one are something that the community has been looking forward to, and something we think people will enjoy.  </p>

<h2>ABOUT THE ANIMATORS</h2>
<p>Our creative team on the project consists of Michelle Cortese and Peter Cetinich.  With Michelle’s background in creative arts and Peter’s knack for storyboarding and project management, the team is working towards creating unique character models, setting up tropes and building storylines using audio from the podcasts you already know and love. The goal for this project, outside of creating a first season for the fans, is to also gain some experience in creating video content for future Binge Media endeavors, including possible live podcasts and other unique video projects. With your backing, our animation team can get to work crafting and shaping the next step in the evolution of Binge Media.</p>
<h2>BUDGET BREAKDOWN</h2>
<p><i><strong>We're in the process of breaking this thing down so it's transparent for all.  Stay tuned and we'll post an update for this very soon!</strong></i></p>
<h2>TIMELINE FOR PRODUCTION AND RELEASE</h2>
<p>There's still a bit of a learning curve with the animation software, as it's the first time the animators have used it.  Saying all that, since we have a small team (seriously, they're super short), it may take up to a month/month and a half from storyboard to finished episode.  We wish it would take a shorter amount of time but we all have jobs and kids and pets and we're doing this in our spare time.  We will definitely be updating our progress throughout this whole process to maintain transparency.   In the immortal words of one of our wisest men:  Trust, bruv.</p>

<h2>ONCE DONE, THEN WHAT?</h2>
<p>Once the project is created, we plan on rolling it out via YouTube and social media. There will be no additional cost to view the episodes online, and they will be released on a week-by-week basis, rather than a typical Netflix-N-Binge type style.

<p>The Binge Media team is used to putting themselves out there, and as such we’re anything but shy.  The biggest challenge we face on this journey is, simply put, acquiring the funds to make it possible.  While we do make some income off our Patreon subscriptions, that goes directly into site maintenance and upkeep.  This project, due to its very nature, requires a more specific investment to make happen.  That’s where YOU come in.  Our Indiegogo goal covers the cost of the entire first season, so once we hit our goal we will immediately get to work delivering on the series.  Any additional funds gained from the project will go towards increased production value and, we hope, the start of a second season, or maybe even some bonus episodes.  It depends on where this project ends up, but again, that depends squarely upon YOU, the contributors.</p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>Hello! Filmora is an original content channel ran by a team of NorCal actors. Our mission is to create a channel that offers a selection of films, both dramatic and comedic, interviews, and shorts that are inclusive of all peoples. </p>
<p>This campaign is close to all our hearts here at Filmora because it marks our first! Although we all have our fair share of film experience, whether it be in videography or acting, this is the start of a new chapter, and we want to bring you along!</p>
<p>Being in the film industry has given us a lot of ideas, and we can't wait to share them on our new platform. Your contributions will fuel this venture and support young and hungry artists making a name for themselves! </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Since this is our first campaign we are keeping the goal to a very humble $500. The money will go directly to food and transportation, and from there will be used for gear such as lights,  batteries, nifty camera stabilizers and fancy-smancy audio equipment.</p>
<p>We love you for donating and we want to show you by offering exclusive perks! From a digital photo on set to a credit on the film, we have a variety of ways we are saying ""Thank you"" for helping us out!</p>
<p>So what if we don't get $500? The money that is donated will be used to feed  and transport our talent and crew. Any left over will be used for other necessities like an extra camera battery or lights.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p><i>Negative Five </i>touches on mental health, race, sexuality, and gender dynamics. It explores the prevalence of anxiety and depression in young adults. It will discuss prejudice and racism. This series takes life in today's society and looks at it through the lens of science fiction. We want this series to allow people who are struggling with identity, mental health, and judgement know that what they are feeling is real and worthy of a conversation in today's world. </p>
<p>The first few episodes will establish the characters and the disappearance, but as the series progresses it will become quite obvious that the fictional parts of the story are symbolic of everyday problems.</p>
<p>All of us at Filmora agree that a discussion on these themes is a necessity. </p>
<p>That's why this project is our first together. We want to set the scene for what Filmora represents: a hub of ideas. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>For this series we will be filming outdoors in breathtaking South Lake Tahoe. Of course many challenges arise from filming outdoors, most common being lighting fluctuations (that dang sun just <i>has</i> to move) and sound pollution (planes I'm talking to you.).</p>
<p>Thankfully we are stretching filming up in Tahoe over several days, reviewing footage in between to make sure everything is in check. This offers us an opportunity to re-shoot any scenes that don't meet our technical criteria. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Trust me, everyone here at Filmora understands if donating is just not an option for you. But thankfully there are other ways you can help! Share this campaign on social media, text your Thursday brunch group, and call your aunt (she's been wanting to hear from you anyways).</p>
<p>By getting the word around we can increase the chances of this project being funded and many more! </p>

When the charismatic Alfie Gigglesburg sets up a trendy rival brewery, the brothers must blackmail a corrupt Member of Parliament, David Bugle, into lowering their beer tax.""WHAT WILL MY DONATION GO TOWARDS?We recognise that £2,000 may sound like a large goal, but with our years of experience working on low-budget productions, this goal would allow us to fund the entire project. Every penny will go towards:
Cast and crew wellbeing
Securing select experienced professional actors
Stunning locations such as mansions, a penthouse and a brewery
Props and costumes designed by our brilliant costume designer, that will make the world feel as immersive and authentic as possible.

NOTE: This budget breakdown is an early estimate that may be changed based on circumstancesOUR STORYBirchall's Pints is the latest exciting project of Some Guys With A Camera, a bold, experimental group of young filmmakers based in Liverpool.We first met in February 2017 on a production course with the Plaza Community Cinema. The creative freedom we were given inspired us to go independent and work on our own projects the following year. After shooting our first film 'Look What I've Got In My Shopping Bag!', we have rapidly expanded, gaining thousands of views and social media followers, with more and more talented young people working on our productions. We believe strongly in celebrating the North West's undiscovered talent, and telling diverse and unique stories.Our past ventures have included:
Producing a no-budget feature film
Premiering our work in multiple cinemas 
Articles written about us in almost every local newspaper
Releasing a comedy Christmas album for charity
Appearing on podcasts around the world

<h2><strong>What is Reimagined?</strong></h2>
<p>Hello my name is Rachel Patrice, and I am the Creator and Head Producer of ReImagined TV series. This is an original television series that reinterprets famous works from films, tv shows and plays. The concept is to reinterpret everything. Each scene will be originally directed, shot, cast, edited and produced. The only thing we will stick to is the dialogue of the characters. Scene interpretations include scenes from Silence of the Lambs, Good Will Hunting and Romeo and Juliet. We plan to shoot this fall, every other Saturday. There are six episodes in total, the first shoot date being September 12th, and the last, November 21st.  </p>
<h2>Funding </h2>
<p>As of now, we need financial support in the following areas:</p>
<p><strong>Production Design: $400</strong></p>
<p><strong>Costumes: $400</strong></p>
<p><strong>Catering: $600</strong></p>
<p><strong>Transportation: $150</strong></p>
<p><i>*We are currently determining our final goal for budgeting. We may or may not need financial assistance for film equipment. </i></p> <p><u><strong>Total: $1,550</strong></u></p> <h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>I got the idea to create this show after a conversation with one of my best friends, and fellow actor, Mariama Conde. We were heartbroken over the fact that, as women of color, we would now always get cast in roles we wanted to play. And, how unfair it can be when people aren’t always chosen to play a role they could be perfect before because of their race, gender, sexual orientation, gender orientation, etc. This is a show meant to elevate BIPOC, LBGTQ folks, and Non-Binary individuals- as well as pay homage to beloved classics. We hope you can support us in our journey to expand the art of cinematic storytelling, and to explore new depths of what it could be. </p>

<h3>Inspiration </h3>
<p>Growing up, I went to an all-girls’ school for 13 years where I was basically trained to be a feminist. (Shout out to any Baldwin Bears reading this!)  We were taught to be the best at what we did and be at the top of our fields. For many years, I felt like a horse with blinders charging hard towards a successful career. When I got pregnant, I swore to myself that having a baby wouldn’t change anything. I would be as ambitious as ever. I wouldn’t let motherhood change me.</p>
<p>But it did.</p>
<p>Motherhood did to my identity what it did to my vagina — tore it to pieces. When I put them back together they weren’t the same. I wasn’t the same. I had spent my whole life pursuing a career in ""The Biz"" as they call it (btw, no one calls it that) while working odd jobs to pay the bills. Financially, my husband and I decided that it would be best for me to stay home with the baby instead of sending her to daycare, while I waited tables.  It was the hardest thing I've ever done and I did stand-up for over a decade. While spending 24/7 with my baby was often joyous, it was also boring, frustrating and isolating.  By the time my daughter was five months old, I hadn’t spent ten minutes alone with myself outside of my apartment. Where was the independent go-getter I once knew and who was this overwhelmed underslept shell of a woman that I had become? And was she still a feminist?</p>
<p>As I started to reach out to other new moms in my life, I discovered that they were going through a similar kind of identity crisis. I knew I wanted to create a series exploring this issue especially in the light of this new wave of feminism since the 2016 election. </p>
<p><strong>This project itself would not be possible without the supportive and generous community of women and moms that I am lucky enough to have in my life.</strong>  From the folks in the parents writer's group that I founded 8 weeks postpartum to the amazing mother in my neighborhood, who is allowing us to film an integral scene in her incredible home designed by <a href=""https://www.dxastudio.com/Basecamp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">DXA Studio</a>.  This pilot is for YOU.</p>
<h3>The Importance Of This Project</h3>
<p>Today, we are at a turning point in feminist history. There are countless articles and think pieces about ""having it all,"" emotional labor and leaning in (and out). The Baby steps Pilot is semi-autobiographical but it has the potential to be the start of a series that explores what modern feminism and motherhood and looks like for different women. Our voices are unique and important!</p>

</div></div>","About Baby Steps
""Baby Steps"" is a single-camera comedy about a career woman turned stay-at-home mom trying to reconcile her feminism while scraping banana off the floor. A dark comedy in the vein of Catastrophe, Casual, ""Baby Steps"" explores the tensions between modern feminism and motherhood. 
About Me 
I have a background in comedy — I was a nationally touring stand-up comedian for over a dozen years. I’ve written and produced three of my own viral web series and worked on the production team for countless digital shorts for Don’t Think Productions, the in-house production company at the Upright Citizens Brigade. I also produced Two Little B*#ches, an independent film which won first place for narrative feature at The Bowery Film Festival. I currently live in Brooklyn with my husband, two daughters and a menagerie of rescue animals. You can check out all my various projects at DavaKrause.com.
