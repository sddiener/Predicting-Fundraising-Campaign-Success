Co-funding by the <a href=""http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/erasmus-plus_en"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Erasmus+</a>: Erasmus Mundus program of the European Union and by our Consortium allows us to offer yearly a <a href=""https://www.uibk.ac.at/astromundus/application.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">number of scholarships</a> to carefully selected, enthusiastic, top-ranked students from around the world. Applicants admitted to this unique program study in up to 4 of our Universities across Europe during the 2 years of the Master course. Most of our graduates successfully obtain PhD positions in Europe and elsewhere.</p>
<h4>With this campaign we want to achieve something more.</h4>
<p>We aim at financing further scholarships especially dedicated to excellent students <i>from those world regions, where higher education in Astronomy and Astrophysics is not yet sufficiently developed or is still missing</i>.</p>
<p>Within the AstroMundus program, these students will receive high-level education and training in this fast growing scientific field and acquire a number of skills that will enable them to embark in doctoral studies and become real experts. Eventually, they will bring back their knowledge to help develop Astrophysics in their home countries both at educational and research level and to foster the involvement of their home countries in large current and future programs of the international astronomical community.  This would in turn encourage technological advances in less developed world regions.</p>
<h3>Update</h3>
<p>Our campaign made it to the October 26th issue of the Italian astronomy and science outreach magazine <a href=""https://www.joomag.com/magazine/coelum-astronomia-205-2016/0834051001475658822/p30"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Coelum Astronomia</a>.

<blockquote>""<i>I had the privilege of being an invited guest professor in Astrophysics with the AstroMundus programme at the Second University of Rome at Tor Vergata on three occasions: the spring semesters of 2011, 2014 and 2015. The students that I met in the Master course there came from highly varied backgrounds, but all were extremely bright, motivated, and enthusiastic. They were presented with quite challenging material, and seemed to absorb it with ease. They were able to acquire the fundamental knowledge and technical expertise necessary for placing them on a path toward sophisticated scientific insight and, in some cases, toward a promising career in astrophysics research. Financing the participation of very promising students who have little or no chance to study astrophysics in their home countries is not only an excellent way to nurture future generations of professional researchers and other scientifically literate citizens. It also makes a significant contribution toward erasing the remaining barriers to international understanding and cooperation in our world, especially in the areas of scientific and technological challenges.</i>""<br/> </blockquote>

<p>Astrophysics is a fast growing science field. While astrophysical research answers our need of understanding the Universe we live in, it also prompts the continuous development of new instruments and techniques that make an impact in many other fields and in our society. Scientific and instrumental projects are developed within large international collaborations that put together their resources to realize increasingly larger, powerful and technologically advanced telescopes, instruments, and space missions and to exploit the enormous flow of data coming from these facilities, as well as develop sophisticated computational models.<br/>Yet, in many countries around the world high-level education in Astrophysics is still insufficiently developed or even missing.</p>
<p>What if we could offer scholarships to bright students from these countries to allow them to travel abroad and participate in an excellence international study program in Astrophysics? What if their dream of studying Astrophysics could come true and they could bring back their knowledge to their home Universities, contribute to start local study programs and take part in the scientific and technological initiatives of the international astronomical community? They would act as the seeds from which new opportunities of development would grow in their society, well beyond the specific field of Astrophysics.<br/>This is the goal we want to achieve with our international Master program AstroMundus. This is what prompted us to start this campaign.</p>
<p><strong>By supporting our campaign you can help us to make a difference and contribute to create new opportunities in developing countries.</strong><br/><br/>Each year we invite and collect student applications from all over the world and select the best students for taking part in our international Master course.<br/>From these applications it emerges that in many countries students receive an education in Physics and Mathematics, but those willing to pursue a career in Astrophysics need to move abroad, if they have a chance to do so, or have to abandon their dream.</p>
<p>Many applicants are motivated to participate in our program not only by the wish to pursue a field of study they are passionate about, but also by the desire to acquire professional knowledge that they could bring back to their home universities.<br/>They want to make a difference in their home country by starting or helping to develop an educational path in Astrophysics at university level. This will open to many other students the possibility to exploit their potential and pursue a career in Astronomy and Astrophysics. At the same time, these future professionals will enable their institutions and countries to join the international community in ambitious and challenging projects.</p>
<p>The synergy between the five Universities and four associated partner research institutions that compose the AstroMundus Consortium, as well as their complementary fields of expertise allow our program to provide admitted students with an excellent background in Astrophysics and to introduce them to topics at the forefront of the astrophysical research. The partly flexible study path across the Consortium Universities exposes the students to a variety of teaching methods and research environments, helps them weaving their professional network in view of their future career, and gives them the opportunity to experience enriching cultural exchanges. The vast majority of AstroMundus graduates are now pursuing their career within doctoral programs at various prestigious institutions around the world. Hence, our program is optimally suited to train future professionals, who will be able to foster development in the world.</p>

Young students from the region are inspired by applications of Astronomy and Space Sciences and are determined to pursue a career in the field, despite limited resources and opportunities <i>(based on information from Kelali Tekle, Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia - OAD East African Regional Node and on experience with former AstroMundus students)</i>;</li>
<li>Within South Asia: Bangladesh and Nepal <i>(based on our experience with former/current AstroMundus students and information from colleagues)</i>;</li>
<li>Within the Southern African region: Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique as priority targets, while considering Namibia and Mauritius, too. All these countries are interested in starting or further developing Astronomy programs. Most of them are partner countries in the <a href=""https://www.skatelescope.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Square Kilometer Array project</a> and hence are in strong need to enhance capacity to carry out research in Astronomy <i>(based on information from Prospery C. Simpemba, The Copperbelt University, Department of Physics, Zambia - OAD Southern African Regional node)</i>.</li>
<li>West African countries, with particular attention to Ghana and Burkina Faso that are currently active in introducing Astronomy programs at undergraduate level <i>(based on information from Bonaventure Okere, Assistant Director, Centre for Basic Space Science, Nsukka, Nigeria - OAD West African Regional Office)</i>;</li>
</ul>
<p>The above list is not exhaustive. There are many more countries, where  higher education in Astrophysics needs to be developed. Therefore, depending on the nationality of the students who will submit an application before November 30th, 2016 and on the strength of their applications, we may consider financing through this campaign scholarships for nationals of additional such countries that are not yet explicitly mentioned in our primary target list.</p>
<p><i>All applications for participation in the AstroMundus program undergo a rigorous selection process aimed at promoting excellence. Scholarships are assigned on a competitive basis.</i></p>
<h2>Use of Funds</h2>
<p>The funds we will raise from this campaign (minus the 5% fee retained by the Indiegogo platform and the 3% to 5% fee applied by PayPal on transactions) will be entirely used to finance scholarships to enable selected, top-ranked students from our target world regions to participate in the AstroMundus international Master Course in Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics.</p>
<p>We are currently collecting applications from international students who aim at participating in the 8th edition of our Masters Course, with deadline November 30th, 2016. With the funds made available by the Erasmus+ program and by the AstroMundus Consortium, we expect to be able to finance 12 scholarships for non-EU students and 5 scholarships for EU students. Based on our experience with the past 7 editions of the course, the number of promising international students that are selected based on their academic excellence and strong motivation largely exceeds the number of available scholarships.</p>
<p>We defined the initial goal amount of this campaign so that it would cover 2 additional scholarships, specifically intended for nationals of countries where the possibility of specializing in Astrophysics are scarce or missing. The amount is calculated as follows: each scholarship includes a contribution to the student's travel and installation expenses of 2,000 euro and a monthly allowance of 800 € for living expenses for the whole duration of the course (24 months).  The AstroMundus Consortium will contribute to these two scholarships by waiving the participation fees (18,000 Euro per student, for non-EU students) and covering with its own resources the student participation costs that include a full insurance package as well as registration and tuition costs. The above mentioned fees applied by Indiegogo and PayPal on the funds raised through the campaign have been included in the calculation.</p>
<p>Since this is a fixed-goal campaign, we will receive the funds only if our initial goal amount is reached. <i>Each contribution will be essential to reach the goal!</i></p>
<p>In the ideal case that the amount raised with this campaign exceeds our initial goal, with the additional funds raised we will increment the two scholarships up to a maximum amount equivalent to an Erasmus+:Erasmus Mundus scholarship funded by the European Union, which is up to 7,000 euro as a contribution for the student's travel and installation expenses and a monthly allowance of 1,000 euro for the 24-month duration of the course.</p>
<p>If the generosity of our backers will make this campaign even more successful, we will use the additional funds to finance further scholarships. This would enable a larger number of promising students among the selected applicants to enroll in the Masters course, thus further increasing the impact of AstroMundus in training future astrophysics professionals and fostering development through them.</p>
<h2>Rewards</h2>
<p>This campaign aims at financing high-level instruction and training of future professionals as a mean to foster future scientific and technological development in less developed countries and world regions. Therefore, we cannot offer products as rewards, but we will demonstrate our gratitude by listing our supporters in our official website, mentioning them in the social networks, and in the acknowledgments section of Master theses and of any scientific publication resulting from Master student projects that benefited from this financial support. Our backers will have the opportunity to get in touch with the students and receive reports of their study progress. Depending on the chosen perk, we will provide our supporters with certificates that acknowledge their contribution,  exclusive astronomical images produced within our Consortium, or electronic copies of Master theses that were financed through this campaign.</p>
<p>Particularly generous supporters who choose to finance a quarter or a half of a scholarship or even an entire scholarship, in addition to all of the above, will have the partial or full scholarship officially entitled to them, will receive a printed copy of the student's thesis and will be invited to join the annual retreat of the program in summer 2018 and/or 2019.</p>
<p>Please note that because of PayPal restrictions on single payments, donations corresponding to a half or full scholarship need to be split into 2 or 4 payments, respectively.</p>
<h2>Risk Assessment</h2>
<p>The AstroMundus program is already running its 6th Edition (2nd year of course) and 7th Edition (1st year of course) and concluded successfully all previous editions. Our Consortium has already secured funds for running the 8th Edition of the course, for which additional scholarships are sought through this campaign.</p>
<p>Each year we received between  100 and 140 applications from all over the world, including from several of the countries and regions that are primary targets of this campaign. Some students from such regions actually participated in our Master course, while many others were selected but could not join because of limited financial resources. Hence we are very confident that this year, too, we will receive a number of applications by suitably qualified candidates, who would qualify for scholarships raised through this campaign.</p>
<p>In parallel to this campaign, we published a call for applications and we will select eligible participants among the applicants during the coming months. We are making additional efforts to advertise our call for applications in the target countries/regions of this campaign, to attract an even higher number of qualified applicants from such regions.</p>
<p>Participating students are supported through an intensive program of tutoring in order to maximize their chances of success in the program. However, should a funded student interrupt the studies at mid-course, the remaining part of the scholarship would be transferred to other participating students who only have a partial scholarship or are self-funding their studies.</p>

<p>AstroMundus offers an excellent educational level in all branches of Astrophysics, as ensured by the wide variety of expertise in the field covered by its international partnership.  Its main objective is to initiate and train students to scientific research with emphasis on the application of modern techniques in Astronomy and Astrophysics in the observational, theoretical, and computational domains. </p>
<p>The program is entirely taught in English and is open to top-ranked students from all over the world. A committee including representatives of all AstroMundus Universities selects applicants on the basis of academic excellence and motivation. Participants study in at least 2 and up to 4 of the AstroMundus Universities during the 2 year-course, the last six months of which are dedicated to the Master thesis research project. After successful completion, they obtain an MSc Joint Degree from all Universities they studied at, which gives them access to doctoral programs. In addition, the variety of skills they acquire during their studies, make them well suited to a number of alternative careers outside of academia.</p>
<h3><b>Our students and alumni</b></h3>
<p>In autumn 2010 we welcomed our first batch of international students. Most of those students and those from subsequent editions have successfully completed the Master course and continued with PhD studies at various institutions around the world. Currently, the 6th edition of the program is at mid-course and the 7th edition has just started (here are the lists of our <a href=""https://www.uibk.ac.at/astromundus/students.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">current students</a> and <a href=""https://www.uibk.ac.at/astromundus/alumni.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">alumni</a>). Until now a total of 102 students from 43 different countries were enrolled in our program, including current students. We are now collecting applications for the course starting in October 2017. Close to 90% of the students who successfully completed the program obtained PhD positions, as visible in our <a href=""https://www.uibk.ac.at/astromundus/alumni.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">alumni</a> list.

</div></div>","Summary
We are a Consortium of 5 Universities and 4 Research Institutions based in Europe and we are running the excellence international Master program in Astronomy and Astrophysics ""AstroMundus"". Co-funding by the Erasmus+: Erasmus Mundus program of the European Union and by our Consortium allows us to offer yearly a number of scholarships to carefully selected, enthusiastic, top-ranked students from around the world. Applicants admitted to this unique program study in up to 4 of our Universities across Europe during the 2 years of the Master course. Most of our graduates successfully obtain PhD positions in Europe and elsewhere.
With this campaign we want to achieve something more.
We aim at financing further scholarships especially dedicated to excellent students from those world regions, where higher education in Astronomy and Astrophysics is not yet sufficiently developed or is still missing.
Within the AstroMundus program, these students will receive high-level education and training in this fast growing scientific field and acquire a number of skills that will enable them to embark in doctoral studies and become real experts. Eventually, they will bring back their knowledge to help develop Astrophysics in their home countries both at educational and research level and to foster the involvement of their home countries in large current and future programs of the international astronomical community.  This would in turn encourage technological advances in less developed world regions.
Update
Our campaign made it to the October 26th issue of the Italian astronomy and science outreach magazine Coelum Astronomia. Many thanks to the editorial board for giving space to our project!
Testimonials
In the videos here below, two AstroMundus graduates, Kristhell López López from Guatemala and Cosmos Dumba from Uganda, talk about their experience in AstroMundus. They explain how their career benefited from their participation in the program and why this will help the community in their home countries.


Endorsements
We are deeply grateful to the following renowned scientists, who are endorsing our program and this campaign in particular.
Craig L. Sarazin, W. H. Vanderbilt Professor of Astronomy, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA, USA:

Peter B. Stetson, Principal Research Officer at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory, NRC Herzberg Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, and Adjunct Professor at the University of Victoria, Victoria, Canada  - June 14, 2016:
""I had the privilege of being an invited guest professor in Astrophysics with the AstroMundus programme at the Second University of Rome at Tor Vergata on three occasions: the spring semesters of 2011, 2014 and 2015. The students that I met in the Master course there came from highly varied backgrounds, but all were extremely bright, motivated, and enthusiastic. They were presented with quite challenging material, and seemed to absorb it with ease. They were able to acquire the fundamental knowledge and technical expertise necessary for placing them on a path toward sophisticated scientific insight and, in some cases, toward a promising career in astrophysics research. Financing the participation of very promising students who have little or no chance to study astrophysics in their home countries is not only an excellent way to nurture future generations of professional researchers and other scientifically literate citizens. It also makes a significant contribution toward erasing the remaining barriers to international understanding and cooperation in our world, especially in the areas of scientific and technological challenges."" 
Jan Palouš, Professor, Astronomical Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences, Prague, Czech Republic, and member of the external Scientific Advisory Board for the evaluation of the AstroMundus program:
 Our Campaign Goal
Astrophysics is a fast growing science field. While astrophysical research answers our need of understanding the Universe we live in, it also prompts the continuous development of new instruments and techniques that make an impact in many other fields and in our society. Scientific and instrumental projects are developed within large international collaborations that put together their resources to realize increasingly larger, powerful and technologically advanced telescopes, instruments, and space missions and to exploit the enormous flow of data coming from these facilities, as well as develop sophisticated computational models.Yet, in many countries around the world high-level education in Astrophysics is still insufficiently developed or even missing.
What if we could offer scholarships to bright students from these countries to allow them to travel abroad and participate in an excellence international study program in Astrophysics? What if their dream of studying Astrophysics could come true and they could bring back their knowledge to their home Universities, contribute to start local study programs and take part in the scientific and technological initiatives of the international astronomical community? They would act as the seeds from which new opportunities of development would grow in their society, well beyond the specific field of Astrophysics.This is the goal we want to achieve with our international Master program AstroMundus. This is what prompted us to start this campaign.
By supporting our campaign you can help us to make a difference and contribute to create new opportunities in developing countries.Each year we invite and collect student applications from all over the world and select the best students for taking part in our international Master course.From these applications it emerges that in many countries students receive an education in Physics and Mathematics, but those willing to pursue a career in Astrophysics need to move abroad, if they have a chance to do so, or have to abandon their dream.
Many applicants are motivated to participate in our program not only by the wish to pursue a field of study they are passionate about, but also by the desire to acquire professional knowledge that they could bring back to their home universities.They want to make a difference in their home country by starting or helping to develop an educational path in Astrophysics at university level. This will open to many other students the possibility to exploit their potential and pursue a career in Astronomy and Astrophysics. At the same time, these future professionals will enable their institutions and countries to join the international community in ambitious and challenging projects.
The synergy between the five Universities and four associated partner research institutions that compose the AstroMundus Consortium, as well as their complementary fields of expertise allow our program to provide admitted students with an excellent background in Astrophysics and to introduce them to topics at the forefront of the astrophysical research. The partly flexible study path across the Consortium Universities exposes the students to a variety of teaching methods and research environments, helps them weaving their professional network in view of their future career, and gives them the opportunity to experience enriching cultural exchanges. The vast majority of AstroMundus graduates are now pursuing their career within doctoral programs at various prestigious institutions around the world. Hence, our program is optimally suited to train future professionals, who will be able to foster development in the world.
Primary Countries Targeted for Support
With the precious advice of the Office of Astronomy for Development (OAD) of the International Astronomical Union and its Regional Offices and based on our experience with past and current AstroMundus students, we defined the following countries and regions as primary targets for support through our campaign: 

Within the Andean Region of South America: Venzuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru - that have good undergraduate programs and are making efforts to further develop or start astronomical research - while considering Bolivia, as well (based on information from Jaime E. Forero-Romero, Associate Professor, Physics Department, Universidad de Los Andes, Bogota, Colombia - OAD Andean Regional Office) ;
Within Central America: Guatemala (based on our experience with former/current AstroMundus students);
Within East and Central Asia: Mongolia - where efforts are currently ongoing to set up a professional Astronomy program; Vietnam, that is currently expanding its astronomical community; Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan (based on information from Richard de Grijs, Full Professor, Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Peking University, Beijing, China - East Asian Regional Node);
Among Portuguese speaking countries: Cape Verde, East Timor, Sao Tome, and Principe, where steps are being made to spread Astronomy at all levels (based on information from Sara Anjos, Project Coordinator NUCLIO, Núcleo Interativo de Astronomia, University of Porto, Portugal - Portuguese Language Expertise Centre for the OAD);
Within Southeastern Europe: Bosnia and Herzegovina and Macedonia (based on experience with former AstroMundus students);
East African region: the countries in the region are making efforts to enhance development in the Astronomy and Space Science field across the region. Young students from the region are inspired by applications of Astronomy and Space Sciences and are determined to pursue a career in the field, despite limited resources and opportunities (based on information from Kelali Tekle, Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia - OAD East African Regional Node and on experience with former AstroMundus students);
Within South Asia: Bangladesh and Nepal (based on our experience with former/current AstroMundus students and information from colleagues);
Within the Southern African region: Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique as priority targets, while considering Namibia and Mauritius, too. All these countries are interested in starting or further developing Astronomy programs. Most of them are partner countries in the Square Kilometer Array project and hence are in strong need to enhance capacity to carry out research in Astronomy (based on information from Prospery C. Simpemba, The Copperbelt University, Department of Physics, Zambia - OAD Southern African Regional node).
West African countries, with particular attention to Ghana and Burkina Faso that are currently active in introducing Astronomy programs at undergraduate level (based on information from Bonaventure Okere, Assistant Director, Centre for Basic Space Science, Nsukka, Nigeria - OAD West African Regional Office);

The above list is not exhaustive. There are many more countries, where  higher education in Astrophysics needs to be developed. Therefore, depending on the nationality of the students who will submit an application before November 30th, 2016 and on the strength of their applications, we may consider financing through this campaign scholarships for nationals of additional such countries that are not yet explicitly mentioned in our primary target list.
All applications for participation in the AstroMundus program undergo a rigorous selection process aimed at promoting excellence. Scholarships are assigned on a competitive basis.
Use of Funds
The funds we will raise from this campaign (minus the 5% fee retained by the Indiegogo platform and the 3% to 5% fee applied by PayPal on transactions) will be entirely used to finance scholarships to enable selected, top-ranked students from our target world regions to participate in the AstroMundus international Master Course in Astronomy & Astrophysics.
We are currently collecting applications from international students who aim at participating in the 8th edition of our Masters Course, with deadline November 30th, 2016. With the funds made available by the Erasmus+ program and by the AstroMundus Consortium, we expect to be able to finance 12 scholarships for non-EU students and 5 scholarships for EU students. Based on our experience with the past 7 editions of the course, the number of promising international students that are selected based on their academic excellence and strong motivation largely exceeds the number of available scholarships.
We defined the initial goal amount of this campaign so that it would cover 2 additional scholarships, specifically intended for nationals of countries where the possibility of specializing in Astrophysics are scarce or missing. The amount is calculated as follows: each scholarship includes a contribution to the student's travel and installation expenses of 2,000 euro and a monthly allowance of 800 € for living expenses for the whole duration of the course (24 months).  The AstroMundus Consortium will contribute to these two scholarships by waiving the participation fees (18,000 Euro per student, for non-EU students) and covering with its own resources the student participation costs that include a full insurance package as well as registration and tuition costs. The above mentioned fees applied by Indiegogo and PayPal on the funds raised through the campaign have been included in the calculation.
Since this is a fixed-goal campaign, we will receive the funds only if our initial goal amount is reached. Each contribution will be essential to reach the goal!
In the ideal case that the amount raised with this campaign exceeds our initial goal, with the additional funds raised we will increment the two scholarships up to a maximum amount equivalent to an Erasmus+:Erasmus Mundus scholarship funded by the European Union, which is up to 7,000 euro as a contribution for the student's travel and installation expenses and a monthly allowance of 1,000 euro for the 24-month duration of the course.
If the generosity of our backers will make this campaign even more successful, we will use the additional funds to finance further scholarships. This would enable a larger number of promising students among the selected applicants to enroll in the Masters course, thus further increasing the impact of AstroMundus in training future astrophysics professionals and fostering development through them.
Rewards
This campaign aims at financing high-level instruction and training of future professionals as a mean to foster future scientific and technological development in less developed countries and world regions. Therefore, we cannot offer products as rewards, but we will demonstrate our gratitude by listing our supporters in our official website, mentioning them in the social networks, and in the acknowledgments section of Master theses and of any scientific publication resulting from Master student projects that benefited from this financial support. Our backers will have the opportunity to get in touch with the students and receive reports of their study progress. Depending on the chosen perk, we will provide our supporters with certificates that acknowledge their contribution,  exclusive astronomical images produced within our Consortium, or electronic copies of Master theses that were financed through this campaign.
Particularly generous supporters who choose to finance a quarter or a half of a scholarship or even an entire scholarship, in addition to all of the above, will have the partial or full scholarship officially entitled to them, will receive a printed copy of the student's thesis and will be invited to join the annual retreat of the program in summer 2018 and/or 2019.
Please note that because of PayPal restrictions on single payments, donations corresponding to a half or full scholarship need to be split into 2 or 4 payments, respectively.
Risk Assessment
The AstroMundus program is already running its 6th Edition (2nd year of course) and 7th Edition (1st year of course) and concluded successfully all previous editions. Our Consortium has already secured funds for running the 8th Edition of the course, for which additional scholarships are sought through this campaign.
Each year we received between  100 and 140 applications from all over the world, including from several of the countries and regions that are primary targets of this campaign.

In many cases, the recruitment of students has been done after convincing their parents or guardians. The school located in Pakistan,  As the school is expanding, the needs for the school have also became larger. The school charges negligible tuition fee (50 cents per month) and meets its operating cost through a for-profit tuition center in the evening and donations. With the limited finances, the expansion of school to add facilities like library and computer lab becomes a challenge. This campaign is to support helping poor Trust build a computer lab-cum-library so that student at the school could get a quality educational experience. And over years more students learn from the resources we help put in place today. Lets avail this opportunity to invest in future.Supporting this cause today will bring you more than just one of our perks. You will be attached to our stories, lives and success. You will impact us. You will become a real piece of our growth. Your support will encourage us to keep going to achieve greater reach. And of course, whenever you decide to visit our beautiful country, you will always be able to count on us to show you our cities, recommend places to go, and help you in any way we can. With your investment in us, you will truly become part of story.The ImpactYour support today brings us closer to achieving the goal of establishing a computer lab-cum-library facility for students who would not have access to such resources otherwise. Education for them does not only mean changing their life but also that of their families, it is in fact an investment into the future of so many young girls and boys.Play your role so that these students can use education to make smarter and better choices. So that they DO NOT fall through the cracks of the society. So they are problem solvers, global shapers, policy makers and NOT another child labor. Your donation is not a one time sum, but rather an investment into the sustainable growth of our school. .What We Need & What You GetThe goal is to be able to construct a computer lab-cum-library at the end of the campaign. However, at the very least we need $6,925 to construct a computer lab in one school. A lot of cost is observed by the support from friends of school who volunteer their time to design, consult and help with the project. For the running operations of the school, it relies on donations from a few donors and profits from an after-school-tuition center for high schoolers for college admission tests in Pakistan. The for-profit tuition center generates just enough revenue to meet its own running costs and that of the school. The running cost of the computer lab would also be covered via the existing revenue system.   Other Ways You Can HelpBeyond donating you can have an impact by: Spreading the Word using the indiegogo share tools and joining our networks! Tell friends and family about our campaign – every word matters!Find out more about.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>During this time, we have noticed that our services are treated in a superficial manner in schools or, at least, that presentations are not carried out in an interactive or attractive for children way.</p>

<p>- Educational Planetarium </p>
<p>- Entertaining Planetarium </p>
<p>-Virtuality tunnel</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We are holding a campaign to present our services to Moldova because there are about 80 percent of children who have never seen something like that.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>At present the amount is estimated to 295 000 USD. </p>
<p>Out of this amount, more than 34 district events are planned to be organized and about 600,000 children will be able to participate in them free of charge.</p>
<p>A total of 50% of school children and preschoolers have the possibility to watch educational films by purchasing tickets, while the other half of children come from families that cannot afford to buy such a ticket or from socially vulnerable, disabled families.</p>
<p>The project is intended to offer the free entry to all persons and to provide our services to as many children as possible.</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>You can follow the events and process in detail on our FACEBOOK page at the link below:</p>
<p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/virtualityshow.md/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/virtualityshow.md/</a></p>
<p>If the full amount is not collected, the amount will be estimated from charity and social assistance funds!</p>
<p>We have organized similar projects for 3 times already and they have enjoyed great success!</p>
<p>We have organized charity events for socially vulnerable families for free.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Through such new projects we offer children the opportunity to interact with information and a new educational style that draws huge interest.</p>

<p>We want all children to enjoy this pleasure of trying advanced technology!</p>

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------At present the amount is estimated to 295 000 USD. 
Out of this amount, more than 34 district events are planned to be organized and about 600,000 children will be able to participate in them free of charge.
A total of 50% of school children and preschoolers have the possibility to watch educational films by purchasing tickets, while the other half of children come from families that cannot afford to buy such a ticket or from socially vulnerable, disabled families.
The project is intended to offer the free entry to all persons and to provide our services to as many children as possible.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------You can follow the events and process in detail on our FACEBOOK page at the link below:
https://www.facebook.com/virtualityshow.md/
If the full amount is not collected, the amount will be estimated from charity and social assistance funds!
We have organized similar projects for 3 times already and they have enjoyed great success!
We have organized charity events for socially vulnerable families for free.
 
Through such new projects we offer children the opportunity to interact with information and a new educational style that draws huge interest.
 
We want all children to enjoy this pleasure of trying advanced technology!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Our Story in Brief</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>I have a dream.</strong> A dream of children around the world connecting via a 100% secure global network based on blockchain technology with approval and oversight of parents.  On this service, they learn  how children in other parts of the world live; they make lifelong friends, learn another language or languages and save for a higher education with a crypto coin for kids called GreanCoin.</li>
<li>The internet is here to stay as are mobile platforms. <a href=""https://greanwoldsworld.wixsite.com/greanpallanguageclub"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>GreanPal</strong></a> makes use of both for a 21st century learning and financial education experience for parents and children.</li>
<li>Imagine a million children in 195 countries connecting and learning from each other.  Imagine children in well off countries learning the plight of and helping children in not so well off countries.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div><div><ul>
<li>We are raising $25,000 to build a working model of the GreanPal interactive website displaying how the friendship, language learning and GreanCoin modules work. This ""landing site"" will then be used to secure total financing of $300,000 to build the complete network.</li>
<li>For every dollar contributed, donors will receive a GreanCoin that has a nominal value of $1.00. By May 2020, the company will be opening an online store selling 100% green products for children and parents where the GreanCoins can be spent. Once the GreanPal system goes online in October 2020, there will be additional options for using GreanCoins including an educational fund and the purchase and charitable use by purchasing carabon credits.</li>
<li>If the company does not reach its financial target in this campaign, it will offer equity to contributing production partners to make up the difference between the cost and the money raised.</li>
</ul></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are 2.2 billion children in the world including 300 million in China 10 and 170 million in India ages 6 and under. Many of these children live in poverty with little or no access to bricks and mortar educational facilities. Most of these areas have access to the internet and moble devices however.

</div></div>","The GoalWe aim to provide teachers with an animated video about soil science. We already have an inspiring song. Now we want to create an animation that will bring the message to life. Please listen to our song. https://soundcloud.com/thesoilisaliveImagine the impact an animation will have with these lyrics. Legendary soil chemist, Dr. Bruce James, breaks down the lyrics in the video below:Why an animated song?Powerpoints can be boring - especially for kids. For this reason, we wrote a catchy, educational tune called ""the Soil Is Alive"".  Photo by Morgan. H West - morganhungerfordwest.com. Why an animation?
A catchy song is one thing. But a vivid animation to go along with it will drive the message home. It will inspire curious young minds to explore the world beneath their feet. 
There are ZERO ""hip"" animated songs about soils. We are here to change that! Kids today love watching music videos, so why not provide teachers with a music video that helps kids explore the hidden life in soils?
Here is an popular example of how a catchy song and animation can yield a powerful learning tool:

Why is soil science education important?“The reason why the Earth is wet is because of its ever-evolving life on its surface.” -Dr. Lynn MargulisThe Earth is wet today, but prolonged droughts, deforestation, and unmitigated industrial and agricultural pollution continue to anchor an irreversible future. This is one of the central reasons why the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization declared 2015 the International Year of Soils. Here are a few things they had to say: 
Healthy soils are the basis for healthy food production. 
Soils support our planet's biodiversity and they host a quarter of the total. 
Soils help to combat and adapt to climate change
Soils improve our resilience to floods and droughts.
Soil preservation is essential for food security and our sustainable future. 



The Team


Music and Melody
Tony Dimeglio - Environmental Science - University of MD 2013  & Virginia Tech Entomology Graduate Students (M.S. Candidate 2016)
The soil enthusiast who had the idea to use music in the classroom to excite youth about soils
Animation
Our animators Tynesha Foreman and Joe Paquette can't wait to work together to animate our song. 
Tynesha has a knack for character development, stop-motion and mixed media. She'll bring life into the animation. Joe is talented with digital media, overlaying natural textures and adding lighting effects. He is key for creating the setting for Tynesha's characters. 
Check out some of their work below:
Tynesha Foreman  - Maryland Institute College of Art

Joe Paquette - George Mason University

Our two incredible animators are already at work. Here are some of their artistic contributions:
Joe Paquette (An idea for animation)


Tynesha Foreman (Logos for outreach material and Indiegogo prizes)


Where Your Funding Goes
We are a group of artists and scientists.
Your contributions are allocated to covering the minimal amount needed to compensate our artists and allow us to distribute the final product.
We really appreciate your support!

Two animators: Animating a 3 minute video demands an enormous amount of time and effort. Because our animators believe in this project they agreed to reduce their fee significantly for us; just enough to cover their time.




Promoting animation: We are traveling to Minneapolis, MN in November 2015 to present the project to entomologist, horticulturalists, agronomists and soil scientists at a National conference joined by American Society of Agronomy, Entomological Society of America, Soil Science Society of America, and Crop Science Society of America.  



Additionally, we will show the animation at Hokie BugFest at Virginia Tech (an event that reaches a diverse group of teachers, students, adults and families of South Western Virginia). More screening and presentations are dependent on funding. Travel is expensive, so we thank you for contributing.

<p><br/></p>
<h3>¿Y si empezamos por un  ""¿Por qué no?""?<br/>
</h3>
<p>Me llamo Alex Mesa (oficialmente: Alejandro). Desde el año 2013 soy Doctorando del Departamento de Filosofía de la UAB. A diferencia de muchos de mis compañeros y compañeras, yo solo fui un buen estudiante durante la carrera y el máster: quiero decir que no fui especialmente brillante. Por ello no soy becario (supongo). Pero desde que en el año 2011 comencé a indagar acerca del papel que el humor había representado y representa en la tradición cultural de Occidente, tuve claro que quería llegar hasta el fondo: por eso soy un Doctorando de los de la variante masoquista: los de por amor al arte, <i>stricto sensu</i>. Pues si hay muchas personas que perjudican sus vidas de múltiples maneras... ¿Por qué no podía ser esta, una de ellas?</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Reírse por no llorar...</h3>
<p>En la actualidad, el trabajo de investigación avanza, no muy raudamente, pero avanza. Y la imaginación también.</p>
<p>De ahí nace la idea de ""Reírse por no llorar"", un pequeño libro (de unas 60 a unas 100 páginas, como máximo) en el que, puede, que se cuenten muchas cosas.</p>
<p>Este proyecto surge de la necesidad de comunicar mi visión personal sobre mi trabajo, sobre la vida, sobre lo importante y no tan importante de todo ello... De porque, creo, es preferible reírse y no llorar. Viniendo de un licenciado en filosofía y dicho lo dicho, puede sonar a ""rollazo profundo"", pero creed que no va por esa línea, no.</p>
<p>Más bien, es todo una conjunción sobre algunos detalles de mi investigación, mi propia experiencia personal y mi relación con el mundo del humor.</p>
<p>Como en este proyecto se entremezclan tantas cosas (tantas serias y tantas que no), quizá es mejor dejar que el proyecto vea la luz, y entonces ya luego se critica lo que se tenga que criticar.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Podríais decir ahora: ""¿Y no te podrías haber quedado todo eso dentro de ti?""</h3>
<p>Y aquí es cuando cualquier toque trascendental (por cierto: esta palabra está muy pervertida) se disipa. ¿Por qué no guardarlo para mi interior?</p>
<p>Podría decir que necesitaba comunicarme con el mundo... pero estaría mintiendo. Ya lo hago. Y bastante a menudo. Y, sí, me gusta que mis inquietudes, mis relatos, mis opiniones... suelan ver la luz, pero es más que probable que no lo hubiera deseado tan claramente con este proyecto. <br/></p>
<p>Pero, en fin, si os remontáis unas líneas arriba, podréis cercioraros de que he dicho que soy Doctorando de la variante masoquista: sin beca. Pero eso no quiere decir que no tenga gastos. Que son muchos. Y aunque, realmente, el dinero que se consigue recaudar aquí no va más allá de cubrir los gastos editoriales... ¿Quién sabe? Quizás acabe vendiendo tantos ejemplares de mi posterior obra que pueda dejar de ser una tachuela telefónica por la tarde (y, por cierto, muy mal remunerada, por si es necesario matizarlo...).</p>
<p></p>
<h3>¿En que invertiré lo conseguido por esta campaña?</h3>
<p>Podría irme a Miami, pero estaría feo. Y no creo que mis directores de Tesis lo vieran con buenos ojos.</p>
<p>Desglose de gastos (Nota: las cifras están redondeadas, en ningún caso el importe es superior o inferior a 50€ de lo mencionado):</p>
<p>1.500€................ Gastos Editoriales (que cubren la edición, el ISBN, la maquetación, etc. + los compromisos adquiridos con los micromecenas en forma de recompensas)</p>
<p>500€.................... Gastos y comisiones derivados de la campaña (comisión de la plataforma de Crowfunding + gastos de envío de las recompensas)</p>
<p>Cabe reseñar que el objetivo económico fijado en esta campaña es el mínimo para cubrir gastos, pero que sería necesario obtener más para poder desarrollar el proyecto en mejores condiciones. Para ser exactos, se necesitarían unos 400€ adicionales para mejorar la calidad de edición de la obra (gastos editoriales). A partir de ahí, todo lo ""extra"", serviría para cubrir gastos derivados de mi investigación que, por supuesto, comenzarían con los costos gastos de matrícula de Doctorado (unos 600€), pero que  van mucho más allá de los mismos (quizá eso explique  que seamos pocos los Doctorandos de la ""variante masoquista"", y bastantes más los de la ""variante profesional"", es decir, de los que cobran).

Do you have problems with math? 


Do you want to ask a math question from anywhere, at anytime at your convenience? 


Do you want to have a qualified math tutor? 


If your answer is yes to all then contribute NOW to get your solution.

I am Romzee, founder of Singapore Enovation Enterprises (SEE). Singapore is third worldwide in the PISA rankings for mathematics education. I was an educationist with 15 years experience in teaching math and science.
We offer an innovative math tuition using the WhatsApp application. You just need an internet enabled smartphone with camera function and you are good to go.
Other than getting help in math, you would also help us in our research on the use of smartphone technology in math education.    The Sums  We offer you mathematics consultation at 1 hour blocks at US$99 using WhatsApp.  
You can get it for yourself, your children or ""donate"" it to others. Only an internet enabled smartphone with camera function is needed.
The good thing is that the 1 hour block is not continuous. Divide it into smaller blocks. In between, you can spend on your own sweet time working on a math problem. 
All your consultations is recorded in the WhatsApp for future references. Wait, there is more! Other than yourself and the tutor, you get to invite another person into the chat group. Buy 1 and get 1 free!
Have a go with our service by choosing any of the perks available. If you are satisfied with it, we can extend it and renegotiate on the terms and conditions. 
One last thing if you have chosen our 1 , 2 or 3 hours block perks and not satisfied with the service, we will return 45% of the amount you have paid.
    

The Additions
Sign up for our 3-hour blocks and you will get 2 copies of our 10 page maths booklet for free! The booklet list out math formulas and common mathematical solving techniques.




          


The topics covered includes basic set theory (notations, Venn Diagrams, set operations) , 

algebra (simplification, factorization, linear equations, quadratic equations, subject formula),  
trigonometry (sine rule, cosine rule, obtuse angles), 
mensuration (perimeter and area of special quadrilaterals, surface area and volume of cuboids, prisms, cylinders, pyramids), 
matrices, vectors, statistics, practical mathematics and much more.




Math, Health & the Environment
Actually we are not just doing math. Math is integral in business and science. Math education is our core activity at the moment but we also care about people and the environment.
We need capital to do research and make prototypes for a fat reduction belt, human powered generator and roof top urban farming. Our focus will be on preventive healthcare and sustainable solutions for city living. If we can combine the two together that will be great.

<h2>How the idea came to us:</h2>
<p><br/>Four years ago, we decided to support children with limited resources so that they had access to quality education and thus a greater opportunity to compete in this world. During a visit to a community of extreme poverty in Guatemala we met Jenny, an adorable little girl born with spina bifida, a degenerative disease that makes it impossible for her to go to school and learn, Jenny was our inspiration to develop a platform that could bring Education to all those girls and boys who can not access it through various situations.</p>
<p>We are a group of friends from different cultures who love Spanish. For this reason we are looking for an element that was important and unifying in all Spanish-speaking cultures and was born Frijoleo = Frijol (Bean) + Leer (Read)</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1491414622/wx5yhed2mxszmsraykkv.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This is how our dream began, wanting to help children who have difficulty going to school. However, now we realize that this dream can go much further. We see the possibility that no child, with or without resources, has access to an entertaining platform to learn to read and write. There is no platform like this for the Spanish speaking community that is accessible, easy, intuitive, fun and functional that provides a high quality education and that guarantees its learning.</p>
<h3>
<br/>We need your support and we will take care of it to reach those who need it.</h3>
<p>To this day we have done a lot of research trying to learn what the best teaching and learning techniques are for kids. We have spent a year designing and developing the first phase of our game which consists of the complete alphabet and the construction of the first syllables. However, the way is still long, our desire is that our platform help children learn letters, syllables, words, phrases, sentences, sentences and then types of writing. Of course we want to launch an app for mobile and mobile devices and this is part of our next phases. According to our financial projections to achieve the next phases of the project we need to raise $ 175,000.00.</p>
<p>With this money we will give life to the new worlds and new adventures of Frijoleo where children will enjoy learning and playing at the same time. Our desire is to facilitate access to our platform at all so money will always be available to achieve this goal. Frijoleo will be a self-sustaining project that will be financed from the sale of worlds and new levels, prizes, promotions, products, books and other articles that will be developed as part of the natural growth of the project and our goal will be that for each child who pays for The use of Frijoleo will have a child benefited who will have access to the tool for free.</p>
<h3>
<br/>What do we dream? What do we want to achieve?</h3>
<p>Our desire is to eliminate illiteracy, we know that it is an ambitious goal and we know that to achieve it requires much more than an application, but we are not afraid to achieve it, we believe that all deserve the same opportunity and it is our task, our responsibility to bring This opportunity to all those who today are in more complicated situations, so we ask ourselves where do we start? We started by doing our part. We want to build the largest community of Spanish-speaking education that exists to bring this right to all.</p>
<h3>
<br/>But it's not just about creating an application ...</h3>
<p>For a project like the one we are developing it is necessary to have a lot of involved and many resources, in countries like Guatemala, not only to create the application for everyone to have access, we need equipment, internet, energy and often none of these components Available in communities of extreme poverty.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Would you like to support us?</h3>
<p>There are many ways you can support us in pushing this process. We need volunteer teachers to go to schools and help children practice reading and writing skills. We can take advantage of equipment: Tablets, computers, laptops, smartphones. We can take advantage of materials such as paper, crayons, pencils or if you have a printer it would be fantastic to bring printed materials to the chic. Help us bring these options closer to the children who need it, there are thousands of ways you can activate money is always useful and of course it is welcome but we are going after an improvement in culture and create opportunities for all.</p>

<p><strong>Making Oxford a Better Place for Theatre</strong></p>
<p>Help offset the cost to schools for bringing in theatre companies in order to help students with their GCSE and A-Level studies:</p>
<p>We intend to ensure that our actors are fairly rewarded for the work they do for us. Whenever possible this is done through giving 60-70% of our profits from productions to the cast.</p>
<p>Making theatre more accessible to the public. This covers everything from taking our shows to people that don't normally have the chance to go to the theatre, to making difficult texts, like Shakespeare, easier for people to follow and understand.</p>
<p>We always promise to provide our audiences with the highest quality or production that our means will allow.</p>
<p>We cast our actors based on talent alone. We don't care about experience or degrees. If we feel that you're right for the part then it's yours.</p>
<p>Students are being expected to write coursework and sit exams about plays that they have never seen. Your contribution will help end that.</p>
<p>We will also be offering workshops on the play from an actor’s perspective. Something that gives new insight into the works of Shakespeare that students don’t often get.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>We're asking for just £2000 to offset the cost of performing in a number of schools around Oxfordshire. These students deserve to see the play they’re studying and shouldn’t be held liable for cuts to their budget.</p>
<p>By pledging you will be helping the arts in Oxford. If companies like our can continue to opperate and pay our actors then the quality of theatre in the county will increase.</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal we will take the funds that we do have and make them work as best as possible.</p>
<p>If we excede our goal then it means we can do even more with the production than we originally thought possible and take it to more schools than originally planned.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>

</div></div>","Making Oxford a Better Place for Theatre
Help offset the cost to schools for bringing in theatre companies in order to help students with their GCSE and A-Level studies:
We intend to ensure that our actors are fairly rewarded for the work they do for us. Whenever possible this is done through giving 60-70% of our profits from productions to the cast.
Making theatre more accessible to the public. This covers everything from taking our shows to people that don't normally have the chance to go to the theatre, to making difficult texts, like Shakespeare, easier for people to follow and understand.
We always promise to provide our audiences with the highest quality or production that our means will allow.
We cast our actors based on talent alone. We don't care about experience or degrees. If we feel that you're right for the part then it's yours.
Students are being expected to write coursework and sit exams about plays that they have never seen. Your contribution will help end that.
We will also be offering workshops on the play from an actor’s perspective. Something that gives new insight into the works of Shakespeare that students don’t often get.
What We Need & What You Get
We're asking for just £2000 to offset the cost of performing in a number of schools around Oxfordshire. These students deserve to see the play they’re studying and shouldn’t be held liable for cuts to their budget.
By pledging you will be helping the arts in Oxford. If companies like our can continue to opperate and pay our actors then the quality of theatre in the county will increase.
If we don't reach our goal we will take the funds that we do have and make them work as best as possible.
If we excede our goal then it means we can do even more with the production than we originally thought possible and take it to more schools than originally planned.
The Impact
The combination of the free performance and workshops will mean that students in the county will have much more insight into the play and offer them a better chance at scoring well on their exams.
We've had actors move on to attend RADA, LAMDA, Bristol Old Vic and Central School of Speech and Drama. A production and tour like this will help even more of them.
This is a company run by actors. As such, we have more interest in producing quality theatre than in making loads of money.
Risks & Challenges

<p>ADEA</p>
<p>Dialogue sur l’éducation pour le leadership et le changement</p>
<p>Un forum pour le dialogue politique sur l’éducation en Afrique</p>
<p>Un réseau de décideurs, de praticiens et de chercheurs</p>
<p>Un partenariat entre ministères de l’éducation et agences de développement</p>
<p>Un catalyseur des réformes éducatives</p>
<p>Une plateforme pour la promotion des connaissances, compétences et qualifications critiques</p>
<p>Qu’est-ce que l’ADEA ?</p>
<p>L’Association pour le développement de l’éducation en Afrique (ADEA) est avant tout un forum de dialogue sur les politiques. Fondée en 1988 pour servir de cadre à une meilleure coordination des agences de développement, elle est devenue un partenariat entre les ministres africains de l’éducation et de la formation et leurs partenaires techniques et externes.</p>
<p>L’ADEA est avant tout un forum de dialogue sur les politiques éducatives. Elle sert de catalyseur de réformes, de politiques et de pratiques prometteuses à travers la mutualisation des réflexions, des expériences, des enseignements tirés et des savoirs. Sa principale raison d’être est d’encourager les échanges entre les ministères de l’éducation et entre eux et les agences de développement.</p>
<p>L’ADEA est avant tout un forum de dialogue sur les politiques éducatives et un véritable partenariat entre les ministres africains de l’éducation et de la formation et leurs partenaires techniques et financiers.</p>
<p>Fondée en 1988 à l’instigation de la Banque mondiale, elle a évolué pour devenir aujourd’hui une institution panafricaine basée en Afrique au sein de la Banque africaine de développement (BAD).</p>
<p>L’ADEA est aussi un réseau de décideurs, d’éducateurs et de chercheurs et, de par sa capacité à promouvoir le dialogue politique et à mutualiser les réflexions, les expériences, les enseignements tirés et les savoirs, un catalyseur pour les réformes de l’éducation. Elle est reconnue aujourd’hui comme un acteur important dans les processus de dialogue, de partage et d’apprentissage pour la transformation qualitative de l’éducation au service du développement de l’Afrique.</p>
<p>L’un des principes qui sous-tendent la philosophie de l’ADEA est que la responsabilité du développement de l’éducation incombe aux gouvernements des pays africains. C’est pourquoi l’ADEA s’efforce d’encourager un processus qui responsabilise pleinement les ministères africains de l’éducation et familiarise les agences de développement avec le concept d’appropriation nationale. Les activités de l’ADEA permettent de renforcer le dialogue politique entre les gouvernements et les agences, entre les gouvernements, et entre les agences de développement. Elles visent également à développer les capacités institutionnelles et techniques en Afrique en établissant des réseaux d’échange d’informations et en diffusant les stratégies et les innovations réussies. Toujours dans cet esprit, l’ADEA encourage les échanges régionaux, sous-régionaux et transnationaux ainsi que les partenariats avec la société civile.</p>
<p>Comment fonctionne-t-elle ?</p>
<p>L’ADEA est dirigée par un Comité directeur composé de ministres africains de l’éducation et de représentants d’organismes de développement multilatéraux et bilatéraux qui apportent leur soutien à l’éducation en Afrique.</p>
<p>Le Comité directeur est appuyé par un Comité exécutif. Celui-ci est mandaté pour faciliter les décisions sur les questions opérationnelles afin que le Comité directeur puisse se concentrer sur les questions politiques et stratégiques. En dehors de sa fonction dirigeante, le Comité directeur de l’ADEA est également la principale instance de coordination entre organismes de financement, entre ministères africains de l’éducation et entre ces deux groupes. Les ministres de l’éducation qui siègent au Comité directeur de l’ADEA constituent le Bureau des ministres de l’ADEA.</p>
<p>Les ministres qui y siègent représentent les cinq régions du continent africain (Afrique de l’Ouest, Afrique de l’Est, Afrique centrale, Afrique australe et Afrique du Nord). Le Bureau des ministres sert de cadre de concertation et de consultation sur les défis et les opportunités de développement de l’éducation en Afrique.</p>
<p>En 2008, le Bureau des ministres de l’ADEA et celui de la Conférence des ministres de l’éducation de l’Union africaine (COMEDAF) ont fusionné, conformément à la décision entérinée par le Dixième Sommet des Chefs d’État de l’Union africaine en janvier 2008.</p>
<p>Le Secrétariat de l’ADEA assure la coordination générale des programmes et activités de l’ADEA, y compris ceux des groupes de travail. Il facilite les échanges d’information et la communication, organise les Biennales (aujourd’hui Triennales) et les réunions du Comité directeur, publie les résultats des travaux de l’ADEA, développe et met à jour les bases de données sur l’éducation et gère certains programmes tels que le Prix pour la recherche en éducation et le Prix africain du journalisme d’éducation.</p>
<p>Historique</p>
<p>L’ADEA a été créée en 1988, sous l’appellation DAE : Bailleurs de fonds pour l’éducation en Afrique. Aujourd’hui, l’ADEA est une organisation panafricaine basée en Afrique et hébergée par la Banque africaine de développement (BAD).</p>
<p>L’ADEA a été créée en 1988, sous l’appellation DAE : Bailleurs de fonds pour l’éducation en Afrique. Son mandat initial était tiré des recommandations d’une étude de la Banque mondiale de 1988, intitulée L’éducation en Afrique subsaharienne : pour une stratégie d’ajustement, de revitalisation et d’expansion.</p>
<p>La DAE avait pour mission de poursuivre le dialogue sur les politiques initié par cette étude et de servir de cadre à une meilleure coordination des agences de développement. L’Association s’est rapidement agrandie pour intégrer la plupart des organismes de développement multilatéraux, bilatéraux et privés.</p>
<p>En 1992, l’ADEA invite cinq ministères africains de l’éducation à siéger au Comité directeur.</p>
<p>La même année, un Secrétariat indépendant est ouvert à Paris ; il est hébergé dans les locaux de l’Institut international de planification de l’éducation (IIPE) de l’UNESCO.</p>
<p>Afin de mieux refléter le partenariat entre ministres et agences de développement, l’appellation de l’association sera modifiée en 1996 et la DAE devient l’ADEA : Association pour le développement de l’éducation en Afrique. En 1997, le nombre de ministres qui siègent au Comité directeur passe de sept à dix.</p>
<p>2008 a été une année charnière :</p>
<p>Le Secrétariat de l’ADEA est transféré à Tunis, au sein de la Banque africaine de développement (BAD), sa nouvelle institution hôte.</p>
<p>Un protocole d’Accord est signé entre l’ADEA et l’Union africaine, scellant les relations entre les deux organisations dans le cadre de la mise en oeuvre de la Deuxième décennie de l’éducation pour l’Afrique.</p>
<p>Les Bureaux des ministres de l’ADEA et de la COMEDAF fusionnent.</p>
<p>L’ADEA lance son premier Plan stratégique à moyen-terme (2008-2012).</p>
<p>En 2012, suite à un long processus de consultation entamé en 2011, une nouvelle vision de l’avenir de l’ADEA est approuvée et un nouveau Plan stratégique à moyen terme (2013-2017) est adopté pour guider sa mise en oeuvre.</p>
<p>Le Cadre stratégique issu de la Triennale 2012 pour guider la mise en oeuvre de ses recommandations est entériné par les Chefs d’État présents au Sommet de l’Union africaine d’Addis Abeba en janvier 2013.</p>
<p>Comment l’ADEA encourage-t-elle le dialogue ?</p>
<p>L’ADEA est avant tout un forum pour le dialogue sur les politiques d’éducation et de formation en Afrique. Ce dialogue politique est mené à travers les séminaires du Comité directeur, les Biennales/ Triennales et autres évènements majeurs.</p>
<p>Les Biennales/Triennales de l’ADEA</p>
<p>1993 La mise en oeuvre de projets et de programmes éducatifs (Angers, France)</p>
<p>1995 Les processus d’élaboration d’une politique éducative (Tours, France)</p>
<p>1997 Partenariats pour le renforcement des capacités et l’amélioration de la qualité de l’éducation en Afrique (Dakar, Sénégal)</p>
<p>1999 Éducation en Afrique – réussites et innovations : l’Afrique parle! (Johannesburg, Afrique du Sud)</p>
<p>2001 Aller plus loin, aller vers tous – pérenniser les politiques et pratiques efficaces pour l’éducation en Afrique (Arusha, Tanzanie)</p>
<p>2003 La quête de la qualité : à l’écoute des expériences africaines (Grand Baie, Maurice)</p>
<p>2006 Éduquer plus et mieux. Comment assurer l’efficacité des apprentissages dans les écoles et programmes d’alphabétisation et de DPE ? (Libreville, Gabon)</p>
<p>2008 Au-delà de l’éducation primaire : défis et approches pour étendre les opportunités d’apprentissage (Maputo, Mozambique)</p>
<p>2012 Promouvoir les connaissances, compétences et qualifications critiques pour le développement durable de l’Afrique (Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso)</p>
<p>2017 Revitaliser l'éducation dans la perspective du Programme universel 2030 et de l'Agenda 2063 pour l'Afrique (Diamniadio, Dakar, Sénégal)</p>
<p>Pour l’ADEA, le dialogue sur les politiques est au coeur du processus de soutien aux pays africains qui sont engagés dans un travail de planification et de mise en oeuvre des réformes de leurs systèmes éducatifs. Les Biennales/Triennales offrent une opportunité unique de communication informelle et d’échanges. L’expérience montre que ces occasions informelles de discuter de questions importantes qui touchent l’éducation et le développement en Afrique (voir l’encadré ci-contre) sont également importantes pour créer un engagement et une confiance entre les différents partenaires, qu’ils soient des ministres africains de l’éducation, des représentants à haut niveau d’agences de développement, d’acteurs du secteur privé, de représentants de la société civile ou de la jeunesse. Ces échanges francs et ouverts entre acteurs et parties prenantes forment la base d’une compréhension commune et de progrès.</p>
<p>Le dialogue sur les politiques est également favorisé par les séminaires du Comité directeur de l’ADEA, qui ont pour principal objectif la discussion, à haut niveau, entre ministres africains et organismes membres de l’Association, sur des thèmes prioritaires pour l’éducation. Parmi les sujets qui ont été traités figurent : les nouvelles initiatives et tendances de la coopération au développement dans le domaine de l’éducation, le financement de l’éducation, l’avenir des groupes de travail de l’ADEA dans le contexte africain actuel et les Biennales/ Triennales de l’ADEA.</p>
<p>L’ADEA encourage également la coopération et le dialogue régional et sous-régional. En fonction des besoins exprimés par le Bureau des ministres africains, l’ADEA organise des réunions techniques et des conférences ministérielles sous-régionales sur des sujets d’intérêt commun pour encourager la coopération entre les pays. Les thèmes suivants ont été traités : l’éducation et le VIH et SIDA ; les TIC dans le secteur de l’éducation ; l’éducation en situation de conflits et de postconflits ; l’enseignement secondaire ; les enseignants contractuels ; l’enseignement bilingue et en langue maternelle ; l’éducation pour les populations rurales ; les initiatives pour l’abolition des frais scolaires ; le dialogue entre ministres des finances et de l’éducation ; l’éducation pour la paix ; et la formation, l’insertion et l’emploi des jeunes en Afrique.</p>
<p>Groupes de Travail, Task Forces et PQIP</p>
<p>Les groupes de travail et les Task Forces de l’ADEA lui offrent une perspective unique sur des questions spécifiques. Ils mènent un travail exploratoire et examinent la performance dans leur domaine spécifique. Bien qu’ils soient tous structurés et gérés de façons différentes, ils mènent tous des activités de recherche, de renforcement des capacités, de plaidoyer et de réseautage. La plupart des groupes de travail de l’ADEA sont basés en Afrique au sein d’organismes dont la priorité thématique et les mandats sont proches des leurs. Ils peuvent être dirigés par des organismes de financement ou des organisations africaines. Actuellement, les groupes de travail couvrent les thèmes suivants : Livres et matériel éducatif ; Communication pour l’éducation et le développement ; Développement de la petite enfance ; Gestion de l ’éducation et appui aux politiques; Enseignement supérieur ; et Éducation non formelle. Les activités de l’ancien groupe de travail sur la participation féminine (GTPF) ont été absorbées au sein du Forum des éducatrices africaines (FAWE). Le FAWE continue d’être impliqué dans les activités de l’ADEA en tant que groupe de travail émancipé et membre associé.</p>
<p>En 2011, le secrétariat de l’ADEA a créé une Task Force sur les TIC qui a pour mandat d’encourager l’intégration pertinente et efficace des technologies d’information et de la communication dans l’éducation et la formation en Afrique. La Task Force a largement contribué à la Biennale 2012 et organisé le 1er premier Forum ministériel sur l’intégration des TIC dans l’éducation en décembre 2013.</p>
<p>Afin de s’assurer que les recommandations issues des activités de l’ADEA soient traduites en action sur le terrain, l’ADEA a impulsé la création de Pôles de qualité inter-pays (PQIP) qui rassemblent des pays confrontés à un défi similaire et des partenaires stratégiques ayant une expertise dans un domaine spécifique. Les PQIP sont dirigés par les ministères de l’Éducation. Il existe actuellement six PQIP qui couvrent les thèmes suivants : Développement de la petite enfance (dirigé par Maurice), Alphabétisation et langues nationales (dirigé par le Burkina Faso), Enseignements des mathématiques et des sciences (dirigé par le Kenya), Éducation pour la paix (dirigé par le Kenya), Développement des compétences techniques et professionnelles (dirigé par la Côte d’Ivoire) et Enseignement et apprentissage (dirigé par le Rwanda).</p>
<p>Depuis sa création l’ADEA :</p>
<p>encourage les acteurs de l’éducation à dialoguer afin de parvenir à un consensus et d’adopter des approches communes pour faire face aux défis majeurs de l’éducation en Afrique ;</p>
<p>contribue au renforcement des capacités de leadership des ministères africains ;</p>
<p>sensibilise ces derniers à la nécessité d’adapter leurs pratiques aux besoins des politiques, programmes et projets éducatifs menés par les pays ;</p>
<p>participe à l’enrichissement de la base de connaissances sur l’éducation en Afrique, grâce à ses recherches, ses investigations et ses publications ;</p>
<p>contribue au développement d'un réseau, grandissant de spécialistes de l’éducation en Afrique ;</p>
<p>encourage le partage d’expertises africaines à travers la coopération et les échanges régionaux, sousrégionaux et transnationaux.</p>
<p>Autres programmes et activités</p>
<p>L’ADEA a également un programme de publications qui permet la diffusion de la recherche et des synthèses de ses activités ainsi que des enseignements tirés de ses biennales et d’autres réunions importantes. Le programme prévoit également la diffusion d’études documentant des expériences africaines réussies mises en lumière par les ministres africains de l’éducation.</p>
<p>L’ADEA est persuadée que de solides compétences dans le domaine des médias et de la communication sont essentielles pour encourager le développement de l’éducation et le changement. En 2001, l’ADEA a créé le Prix africain du journalisme d’éducation Akintola Fatoyinbo qui récompense les meilleurs articles sur l’éducation écrits par des journalistes africains et publiés dans la presse africaine.</p>
<p>En 2009, l’ADEA a également lancé le Prix pour la recherche en éducation en Afrique. Le Prix a pour objectif de promouvoir une recherche de qualité sur l’éducation, produite par des universités, des centres de recherche et des réseaux de recherche africains. Il est organisé par l’ADEA et l’Institut africain pour le développement (IAD) de la BAD avec le soutien financier de la Coopération économique Corée-Afrique (KOAFEC).</p>
<p>L’ADEA a également développé des bases de données sur l’éducation en Afrique. Profil ADEA contient des informations détaillées sur toutes les activités de l’ADEA. CV-Experts est une base de données de spécialistes de l’éducation africains répertoriés par domaine de compétence.</p>
<p>Qui peut participer aux activités de l’ADEA ?</p>
<p>Les deux principales composantes de l’ADEA sont les ministres africains de l’éducation et les organismes de coopération et de développement.</p>
<p>Si la participation aux réunions du Comité directeur et à celles du Bureau (et du Forum) des ministres est restreinte, l’ADEA recherche de plus en plus une participation élargie dans ses autres activités et réunions. Sa vocation à servir de tribune pour la promotion du dialogue sur les problèmes de l’éducation et le développement durable à long terme en Afrique, oblige l’ADEA à s’ouvrir à toutes les parties prenantes intéressées par l’avenir de l’Afrique.</p>
<p>L’ADEA met en oeuvre divers mécanismes pour toucher différents publics. C’est ainsi que les Biennales (aujourd’hui les Triennales) ciblent les décideurs, car leur rôle est essentiel pour l’élaboration et la mise en oeuvre des politiques éducatives et pour guider le programme d’activités de l’ADEA. Par ailleurs, grâce à ses publications et aux activités menées à travers ses groupes de travail, l’ADEA réussit à atteindre les praticiens et autres parties prenantes de l’éducation qui oeuvrent au niveau des écoles ou des communautés.</p>
<p>Participer aux activités de l’ADEA est un excellent moyen de renforcer ses capacités professionnelles, se tenir au courant de l’état de l’éducation dans les différentes parties de l’Afrique, et d’avoir son mot à dire dans la transformation de la politique et de la pratique. L’expérience montre cependant que la plus-value apportée par l’ADEA se situe avant tout dans son approche « réseau », qui favorise les échanges informels. C’est sur cette base que se bâtit la confiance, que se renforce l’appropriation des processus de réforme éducative par les gouvernements et que se construisent de nouvelles relations partenariales entre les ministères de l’éducation et leurs partenaires techniques et financiers.</p>
<p>Comment l’ADEA est-elle financée ?</p>
<p>L’ADEA est financée par les cotisations de ses membres et par d’autres contributions.</p>
<p>La première source de financement est constituée des cotisations que les partenaires du développement et pays versent à l’association pour être membres du Comité directeur. L’ADEA reçoit également d’autres contributions des agences de développement. Ces ressources, lorsqu’elles ne sont pas allouées à des groupes de travail ou à des activités spécifiques, viennent alimenter le budget général qui sert à financer les activités de dialogue sur les politiques et de coopération régionale et sous-régionale, les activités des groupes de travail et des groupes ad hoc, les programmes de gestion des connaissances, de publication et de communication ou de gestion du savoir ainsi que le fonctionnement du Secrétariat.</p>
<p>Que réserve l’avenir ?</p>
<p>L’ADEA comme l’Afrique est dans une phase de transition. En 25 ans, l’ADEA a évolué d’un club de bailleurs de fonds à une organisation panafricaine basée au sein de la BAD. Elle oeuvre de plus en plus avec des instances continentales comme l’Union africaine pour accélérer les progrès dans l’éducation et servir le développement de l’Afrique.</p>
<p>L’ADEA est plus axée sur les besoins et les réalités africaines, plus ambitieuse pour faire face à de nouveaux défis et priorités. Tout comme le continent qu’elle doit servir, elle sera de plus en plus jugée sur ses capacités à faire preuve de responsabilité à tous les niveaux et à apporter des preuves concrètes de ses réalisations. Ces évolutions des demandes et des aspirations ont d’abord été abordées dans le Document de Vision 2012. Depuis, l’ADEA a adopté un nouveau Plan stratégique à moyen terme sur une période de 5 ans pour 2013 - 2017 qui servira de guide à l’Association pendant cette période de transformation et l’aidera à réaliser sa vision. Le plan de mise en oeuvre qui procède par phases établit ce qui est nécessaire pour soutenir les gouvernements africains et permettre à chacun à sa façon de créer des sociétés du savoir basées sur les compétences. Dans les années à venir, le travail de l’ADEA sera motivé par l’engagement à construire une Afrique possédant les connaissances, compétences et qualifications critiques nécessaires pour assurer un développement durable.</p>

Comment fonctionne-t-elle ?
L’ADEA est dirigée par un Comité directeur composé de ministres africains de l’éducation et de représentants d’organismes de développement multilatéraux et bilatéraux qui apportent leur soutien à l’éducation en Afrique.
Le Comité directeur est appuyé par un Comité exécutif. Celui-ci est mandaté pour faciliter les décisions sur les questions opérationnelles afin que le Comité directeur puisse se concentrer sur les questions politiques et stratégiques. En dehors de sa fonction dirigeante, le Comité directeur de l’ADEA est également la principale instance de coordination entre organismes de financement, entre ministères africains de l’éducation et entre ces deux groupes. Les ministres de l’éducation qui siègent au Comité directeur de l’ADEA constituent le Bureau des ministres de l’ADEA.
Les ministres qui y siègent représentent les cinq régions du continent africain (Afrique de l’Ouest, Afrique de l’Est, Afrique centrale, Afrique australe et Afrique du Nord). Le Bureau des ministres sert de cadre de concertation et de consultation sur les défis et les opportunités de développement de l’éducation en Afrique.
En 2008, le Bureau des ministres de l’ADEA et celui de la Conférence des ministres de l’éducation de l’Union africaine (COMEDAF) ont fusionné, conformément à la décision entérinée par le Dixième Sommet des Chefs d’État de l’Union africaine en janvier 2008.
Le Secrétariat de l’ADEA assure la coordination générale des programmes et activités de l’ADEA, y compris ceux des groupes de travail. Il facilite les échanges d’information et la communication, organise les Biennales (aujourd’hui Triennales) et les réunions du Comité directeur, publie les résultats des travaux de l’ADEA, développe et met à jour les bases de données sur l’éducation et gère certains programmes tels que le Prix pour la recherche en éducation et le Prix africain du journalisme d’éducation.
Historique
L’ADEA a été créée en 1988, sous l’appellation DAE : Bailleurs de fonds pour l’éducation en Afrique. Aujourd’hui, l’ADEA est une organisation panafricaine basée en Afrique et hébergée par la Banque africaine de développement (BAD).

La DAE avait pour mission de poursuivre le dialogue sur les politiques initié par cette étude et de servir de cadre à une meilleure coordination des agences de développement. L’Association s’est rapidement agrandie pour intégrer la plupart des organismes de développement multilatéraux, bilatéraux et privés.

La même année, un Secrétariat indépendant est ouvert à Paris ; il est hébergé dans les locaux de l’Institut international de planification de l’éducation (IIPE) de l’UNESCO.
Afin de mieux refléter le partenariat entre ministres et agences de développement, l’appellation de l’association sera modifiée en 1996 et la DAE devient l’ADEA : Association pour le développement de l’éducation en Afrique. En 1997, le nombre de ministres qui siègent au Comité directeur passe de sept à dix.
2008 a été une année charnière :
Le Secrétariat de l’ADEA est transféré à Tunis, au sein de la Banque africaine de développement (BAD), sa nouvelle institution hôte.
Un protocole d’Accord est signé entre l’ADEA et l’Union africaine, scellant les relations entre les deux organisations dans le cadre de la mise en oeuvre de la Deuxième décennie de l’éducation pour l’Afrique.
Les Bureaux des ministres de l’ADEA et de la COMEDAF fusionnent.
L’ADEA lance son premier Plan stratégique à moyen-terme (2008-2012).
En 2012, suite à un long processus de consultation entamé en 2011, une nouvelle vision de l’avenir de l’ADEA est approuvée et un nouveau Plan stratégique à moyen terme (2013-2017) est adopté pour guider sa mise en oeuvre.
Le Cadre stratégique issu de la Triennale 2012 pour guider la mise en oeuvre de ses recommandations est entériné par les Chefs d’État présents au Sommet de l’Union africaine d’Addis Abeba en janvier 2013.
Comment l’ADEA encourage-t-elle le dialogue ?
L’ADEA est avant tout un forum pour le dialogue sur les politiques d’éducation et de formation en Afrique. Ce dialogue politique est mené à travers les séminaires du Comité directeur, les Biennales/ Triennales et autres évènements majeurs.
Les Biennales/Triennales de l’ADEA
1993 La mise en oeuvre de projets et de programmes éducatifs (Angers, France)
1995 Les processus d’élaboration d’une politique éducative (Tours, France)
1997 Partenariats pour le renforcement des capacités et l’amélioration de la qualité de l’éducation en Afrique (Dakar, Sénégal)
1999 Éducation en Afrique – réussites et innovations : l’Afrique parle! (Johannesburg, Afrique du Sud)
2001 Aller plus loin, aller vers tous – pérenniser les politiques et pratiques efficaces pour l’éducation en Afrique (Arusha, Tanzanie)
2003 La quête de la qualité : à l’écoute des expériences africaines (Grand Baie, Maurice)
2006 Éduquer plus et mieux. Comment assurer l’efficacité des apprentissages dans les écoles et programmes d’alphabétisation et de DPE ? (Libreville, Gabon)
2008 Au-delà de l’éducation primaire : défis et approches pour étendre les opportunités d’apprentissage (Maputo, Mozambique)
2012 Promouvoir les connaissances, compétences et qualifications critiques pour le développement durable de l’Afrique (Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso)
2017 Revitaliser l'éducation dans la perspective du Programme universel 2030 et de l'Agenda 2063 pour l'Afrique (Diamniadio, Dakar, Sénégal)
Pour l’ADEA, le dialogue sur les politiques est au coeur du processus de soutien aux pays africains qui sont engagés dans un travail de planification et de mise en oeuvre des réformes de leurs systèmes éducatifs. Les Biennales/Triennales offrent une opportunité unique de communication informelle et d’échanges. L’expérience montre que ces occasions informelles de discuter de questions importantes qui touchent l’éducation et le développement en Afrique (voir l’encadré ci-contre) sont également importantes pour créer un engagement et une confiance entre les différents partenaires, qu’ils soient des ministres africains de l’éducation, des représentants à haut niveau d’agences de développement, d’acteurs du secteur privé, de représentants de la société civile ou de la jeunesse. Ces échanges francs et ouverts entre acteurs et parties prenantes forment la base d’une compréhension commune et de progrès.
Le dialogue sur les politiques est également favorisé par les séminaires du Comité directeur de l’ADEA, qui ont pour principal objectif la discussion, à haut niveau, entre ministres africains et organismes membres de l’Association, sur des thèmes prioritaires pour l’éducation. Parmi les sujets qui ont été traités figurent : les nouvelles initiatives et tendances de la coopération au développement dans le domaine de l’éducation, le financement de l’éducation, l’avenir des groupes de travail de l’ADEA dans le contexte africain actuel et les Biennales/ Triennales de l’ADEA.
L’ADEA encourage également la coopération et le dialogue régional et sous-régional. En fonction des besoins exprimés par le Bureau des ministres africains, l’ADEA organise des réunions techniques et des conférences ministérielles sous-régionales sur des sujets d’intérêt commun pour encourager la coopération entre les pays. Les thèmes suivants ont été traités : l’éducation et le VIH et SIDA ; les TIC dans le secteur de l’éducation ; l’éducation en situation de conflits et de postconflits ; l’enseignement secondaire ; les enseignants contractuels ; l’enseignement bilingue et en langue maternelle ; l’éducation pour les populations rurales ; les initiatives pour l’abolition des frais scolaires ; le dialogue entre ministres des finances et de l’éducation ; l’éducation pour la paix ; et la formation, l’insertion et l’emploi des jeunes en Afrique.
Groupes de Travail, Task Forces et PQIP
Les groupes de travail et les Task Forces de l’ADEA lui offrent une perspective unique sur des questions spécifiques. Ils mènent un travail exploratoire et examinent la performance dans leur domaine spécifique. Bien qu’ils soient tous structurés et gérés de façons différentes, ils mènent tous des activités de recherche, de renforcement des capacités, de plaidoyer et de réseautage. La plupart des groupes de travail de l’ADEA sont basés en Afrique au sein d’organismes dont la priorité thématique et les mandats sont proches des leurs. Ils peuvent être dirigés par des organismes de financement ou des organisations africaines. Actuellement, les groupes de travail couvrent les thèmes suivants : Livres et matériel éducatif ; Communication pour l’éducation et le développement ; Développement de la petite enfance ; Gestion de l ’éducation et appui aux politiques; Enseignement supérieur ; et Éducation non formelle. Les activités de l’ancien groupe de travail sur la participation féminine (GTPF) ont été absorbées au sein du Forum des éducatrices africaines (FAWE). Le FAWE continue d’être impliqué dans les activités de l’ADEA en tant que groupe de travail émancipé et membre associé.
En 2011, le secrétariat de l’ADEA a créé une Task Force sur les TIC qui a pour mandat d’encourager l’intégration pertinente et efficace des technologies d’information et de la communication dans l’éducation et la formation en Afrique. La Task Force a largement contribué à la Biennale 2012 et organisé le 1er premier Forum ministériel sur l’intégration des TIC dans l’éducation en décembre 2013.
Afin de s’assurer que les recommandations issues des activités de l’ADEA soient traduites en action sur le terrain, l’ADEA a impulsé la création de Pôles de qualité inter-pays (PQIP) qui rassemblent des pays confrontés à un défi similaire et des partenaires stratégiques ayant une expertise dans un domaine spécifique. Les PQIP sont dirigés par les ministères de l’Éducation. Il existe actuellement six PQIP qui couvrent les thèmes suivants : Développement de la petite enfance (dirigé par Maurice), Alphabétisation et langues nationales (dirigé par le Burkina Faso), Enseignements des mathématiques et des sciences (dirigé par le Kenya), Éducation pour la paix (dirigé par le Kenya), Développement des compétences techniques et professionnelles (dirigé par la Côte d’Ivoire) et Enseignement et apprentissage (dirigé par le Rwanda).
Depuis sa création l’ADEA :
encourage les acteurs de l’éducation à dialoguer afin de parvenir à un consensus et d’adopter des approches communes pour faire face aux défis majeurs de l’éducation en Afrique ;
contribue au renforcement des capacités de leadership des ministères africains ;
sensibilise ces derniers à la nécessité d’adapter leurs pratiques aux besoins des politiques, programmes et projets éducatifs menés par les pays ;
participe à l’enrichissement de la base de connaissances sur l’éducation en Afrique, grâce à ses recherches, ses investigations et ses publications ;
contribue au développement d'un réseau, grandissant de spécialistes de l’éducation en Afrique ;
encourage le partage d’expertises africaines à travers la coopération et les échanges régionaux, sousrégionaux et transnationaux.
Autres programmes et activités
L’ADEA a également un programme de publications qui permet la diffusion de la recherche et des synthèses de ses activités ainsi que des enseignements tirés de ses biennales et d’autres réunions importantes. Le programme prévoit également la diffusion d’études documentant des expériences africaines réussies mises en lumière par les ministres africains de l’éducation.
L’ADEA est persuadée que de solides compétences dans le domaine des médias et de la communication sont essentielles pour encourager le développement de l’éducation et le changement. En 2001, l’ADEA a créé le Prix africain du journalisme d’éducation Akintola Fatoyinbo qui récompense les meilleurs articles sur l’éducation écrits par des journalistes africains et publiés dans la presse africaine.
En 2009, l’ADEA a également lancé le Prix pour la recherche en éducation en Afrique. Le Prix a pour objectif de promouvoir une recherche de qualité sur l’éducation, produite par des universités, des centres de recherche et des réseaux de recherche africains. Il est organisé par l’ADEA et l’Institut africain pour le développement (IAD) de la BAD avec le soutien financier de la Coopération économique Corée-Afrique (KOAFEC).
L’ADEA a également développé des bases de données sur l’éducation en Afrique. Profil ADEA contient des informations détaillées sur toutes les activités de l’ADEA. CV-Experts est une base de données de spécialistes de l’éducation africains répertoriés par domaine de compétence.
Qui peut participer aux activités de l’ADEA ?
Les deux principales composantes de l’ADEA sont les ministres africains de l’éducation et les organismes de coopération et de développement.
Si la participation aux réunions du Comité directeur et à celles du Bureau (et du Forum) des ministres est restreinte, l’ADEA recherche de plus en plus une participation élargie dans ses autres activités et réunions. Sa vocation à servir de tribune pour la promotion du dialogue sur les problèmes de l’éducation et le développement durable à long terme en Afrique, oblige l’ADEA à s’ouvrir à toutes les parties prenantes intéressées par l’avenir de l’Afrique.
L’ADEA met en oeuvre divers mécanismes pour toucher différents publics. C’est ainsi que les Biennales (aujourd’hui les Triennales) ciblent les décideurs, car leur rôle est essentiel pour l’élaboration et la mise en oeuvre des politiques éducatives et pour guider le programme d’activités de l’ADEA. Par ailleurs, grâce à ses publications et aux activités menées à travers ses groupes de travail, l’ADEA réussit à atteindre les praticiens et autres parties prenantes de l’éducation qui oeuvrent au niveau des écoles ou des communautés.
Participer aux activités de l’ADEA est un excellent moyen de renforcer ses capacités professionnelles, se tenir au courant de l’état de l’éducation dans les différentes parties de l’Afrique, et d’avoir son mot à dire dans la transformation de la politique et de la pratique. L’expérience montre cependant que la plus-value apportée par l’ADEA se situe avant tout dans son approche « réseau », qui favorise les échanges informels. C’est sur cette base que se bâtit la confiance, que se renforce l’appropriation des processus de réforme éducative par les gouvernements et que se construisent de nouvelles relations partenariales entre les ministères de l’éducation et leurs partenaires techniques et financiers.
Comment l’ADEA est-elle financée ?
L’ADEA est financée par les cotisations de ses membres et par d’autres contributions.
La première source de financement est constituée des cotisations que les partenaires du développement et pays versent à l’association pour être membres du Comité directeur. L’ADEA reçoit également d’autres contributions des agences de développement. Ces ressources, lorsqu’elles ne sont pas allouées à des groupes de travail ou à des activités spécifiques, viennent alimenter le budget général qui sert à financer les activités de dialogue sur les politiques et de coopération régionale et sous-régionale, les activités des groupes de travail et des groupes ad hoc, les programmes de gestion des connaissances, de publication et de communication ou de gestion du savoir ainsi que le fonctionnement du Secrétariat.
Que réserve l’avenir ?
L’ADEA comme l’Afrique est dans une phase de transition. En 25 ans, l’ADEA a évolué d’un club de bailleurs de fonds à une organisation panafricaine basée au sein de la BAD. Elle oeuvre de plus en plus avec des instances continentales comme l’Union africaine pour accélérer les progrès dans l’éducation et servir le développement de l’Afrique.
L’ADEA est plus axée sur les besoins et les réalités africaines, plus ambitieuse pour faire face à de nouveaux défis et priorités. Tout comme le continent qu’elle doit servir, elle sera de plus en plus jugée sur ses capacités à faire preuve de responsabilité à tous les niveaux et à apporter des preuves concrètes de ses réalisations. Ces évolutions des demandes et des aspirations ont d’abord été abordées dans le Document de Vision 2012. Depuis, l’ADEA a adopté un nouveau Plan stratégique à moyen terme sur une période de 5 ans pour 2013 - 2017 qui servira de guide à l’Association pendant cette période de transformation et l’aidera à réaliser sa vision. Le plan de mise en oeuvre qui procède par phases établit ce qui est nécessaire pour soutenir les gouvernements africains et permettre à chacun à sa façon de créer des sociétés du savoir basées sur les compétences. Dans les années à venir, le travail de l’ADEA sera motivé par l’engagement à construire une Afrique possédant les connaissances, compétences et qualifications critiques nécessaires pour assurer un développement durable.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Peace Friends of Hope Foundation  is a registered community based organization that was

I am writing to you because Canadian teachers need your help.I design and deliver hands-on media workshops for students of all ages. These workshops are rooted in Media & Digital Literacy, where students learn how to think critically about the media they are consuming, and are then provided an opportunity to create their own media project using digital tools. I also train teachers on how to incorporate these same workshops into their own classrooms.I want to provide all Canadian students the opportunity to express themselves through art-based media projects, no matter what kind of access to technology they have. Creation in this way is empowering, liberating, therapeutic, and so incredibly important for self-expression in the 21st century.I have travelled far and wide throughout Canada delivering Digital and Media Literacy workshops for both teachers and students in order to teach new forms of self-expression and empowerment with technological tools. But through my work across Canada, meeting thousands of teachers and students, I have noticed a very troubling situation: The Digital Divide. Digital Divide: the gap between those who do, and those who do not have access to digital communication technologies and the Internet.Canadian public school classrooms, especially in under-served and lower-income neighbourhoods are being left behind in the age of digital information and education.These students aren’t getting a new laptop or iPad of their own when they begin a new school year. They barely have access to technology in the school at all. Many schools I have visited don’t even have a reliable internet connection in their entire school.Most importantly, these teachers aren’t getting the Digital Literacy training they need. Without this essential professional development for our teachers, our less privileged students in Canada are falling behind in employment, opportunity & success.In 2014 the Canadian Government launched a Digital Initiative for accessibility and education in order to address the Digital Divide. In a report they stated:""Digital media are an omnipresent reality for today's youth. From cell phones to iPods to video games to computers, digital media touch every aspect of students' lives. Digital activities popular with youth may appear to be child's play, but research indicates that these digitized toys and pursuits help young people develop a wide range of aptitudes and skills that are needed in a digital economy.It is, therefore, imperative that their educational experience acknowledges this reality.

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><strong>Robots on human help and significance?</strong></p>
<p>With the economic changes in society, human will tend to high-tech electronic or network work; life quality will change and improve. The high-risk, long-term, high-accuracy, disgusting and bothersome work and the relative lack of manpower are also problems that the community will face.</p>
<p>Robot science, reduce human duplication of work, improve working hours. As the AI function can help the general public in business, it can through the “VR” technology and remote control robotic to attend the meeting or visit the business environment.</p>
<p>In the hospital, it can help doctors and nurses to assist in surgery. 24 hours (face recognition) to monitor the safety of the home, to take care of the elderly and children, the daily guidance and teaching, household cleaning, 24 hours (face recognition) to monitor the spread of infection, the patient 24 hours of continuous care.</p>
<p>Other applications, through “VR” technology, can be used for outbound travel and business trip. In the field of rental services, high-risk work, there are different industries, there are still infinite possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Why do we need to understand and learn robot knowledge?</strong></p>
<p>Global economic power, understand the robot technology will have a long-term human and economic impact, so that over the years, invested over 100 billions in robot research and development.</p>
<p>""Global spending on robots will grow from $ 71 billion in year 2015 to $ 135.4 billion in year 2019. The regional developments in 2015, Asia Pacific (including Japan) accounted for 65% of robot-related investment, followed by Europe and the Middle East, the America is third.</p>
<p>Nearly a decade, robots around the world science and technology, although there, but still in the research and development stage. ""Robots are one of the core technologies driving the transformation of tomorrow's manufacturing, and more and more robots are moving into different areas, such as electronics, healthcare, retail, and logistics,"" according to IDC's new International Business Robotics Guide. Agriculture, services, education and government.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that after the basic study of the book, the future of the robot industry came, we will more likely to invest in new industries and share the benefits of new technology and economy.</p>
<p><strong>Robot of the industrial cycle?</strong></p>
<p>This project, like Karl Friedrich Benz, a 100-year-old Wright brothers (1867) and a gas-powered invention, still affects society and the country's economy to this day. There is a long-term development and will not be replaced by the main reason, the sooner the development will only grasp the future of new industrial status; the robot in the case of continuous optimization, its life cycle will only be longer.</p>
<p><strong>Will robots affect the national economy?</strong></p>
<p>Due to the birth of the new robot industry, the related industries such as mechanical motor, electronics, plastics, metal, etc., will bring greater business opportunities.</p>
<p>National economy, business and industry are a direct impact on the local finance, property and tourism. The reason is that the good production of goods, it will bring the national economy with business opportunities, in addition to people's consumption to increase the country's own money flow, exporting also increase national income. Prosperity, but also the financial, property, tourism, the opportunity to bring prosperity.</p>
<p><strong>Human fear of the emergence of robots?</strong></p>
<p>As for human fear of the robot, it same as ancient primitive people afraid of fire. Also in early, we fear the radio box has a human voice, the camera will absorb the soul, etc. Now a day, it changed our conceptions already. As for applications, such as early pagers to the present mobile phone, or early computers such as closet-like to the present Pocket PC, it will have more possibilities, and then have more opportunities for optimization , and finally to universal access to the world.</p>
<p>Back to the past history, scientific progress, raising the new economy, improve the human life quality and improve the environment. The new economy, nor is it suddenly appeared. We don’t afraid if catch the science and technology. Therefore, mankind will only gradually enter another work level.</p>
<p><strong>Why it is difficult to mass production and application in the market?</strong></p>
<p>In global market, it appeared hundreds design concept prototype robots, but why cannot be perfected for mass production!</p>
<p>1. Only to solve about maintain, professional staff and tools which all are the problems the manufacturers should face to.</p>
<p>2. High tax and expensive delivery cost for exporting robot.</p>
<p>3. Luxury consumer items just able to be afforded by rich group. How to make it popularize?  How to decrease the production cost to public can pay?  That is the question about egg and chicken!</p>
<p>4. Actually robot still in development, that is the point it may not for on sale in the market.<br/> </p>
<p><strong>Why human-like robotic type will be popular then others?</strong></p>
<p><strong>For Environment</strong></p>
<p>The reason why robots use a human height and shape, it is not only flexible, it can do multi-task. Moreover, it does not take up too much space. We do not need to change or tailor-made facilities to fit the robotic size. Because of the proportion of adult height is based on the human. Therefore, it can apply be more and flexible than the other types.</p>
<p><strong>For Using</strong></p>
<p>At the same time, we should depend on the user's ability to develop the robotic. Body size is too large or too small, the relative energy consumption is large or inadequate, if the power supply is exhausted or damaged and fall down, our body can bear their weight, which is also an important consideration or we may be injured or have a greater risk .</p>
<p><strong>For Psychological</strong></p>
<p>We can imagine that space research vacation in future, only a robot and human, you will choose human-like or metal as shape robotic for space trip?</p>
<p>The most important point is the human-like type can wear different jackets to change the outlook or shape to fulfill the different works, but the metal type is impossible to do this.</p>
<p>The above three issues, many robotic types in the world, it should become to one type. For example, in the past few years, people have used the human form of robot to be the hotel reception, window display, education and human-like robotic movie in Japan. Therefore, this type of future development, must save a lot of time to consideration.</p>

All invention from human history, witnessed the innovation, changed the economy and promoted human civilization.
Nowadays, the development of intelligent robot and its trend has being closely concerned by the world. Thus, I hardly believe that intelligent robot will not only bring more convenience to human living, lead the world to a new monument of economy, but will also affect the development of innovative technology which can keep long lasting for the next century.
However, study, research and practice are necessarily required in order to figure out all its uncertainties, pros and cons, before we can grasp this important technical property and enjoy the results!
A year since I completed my “robot dream”, I thanked to the reporting from global-wide media and the invitation from a number of international science and technology exhibitions.  Moreover, I received a lot of requests from the people around the world for consultation regarding the impact of the robot on human being, and asked the way on production.  I hope my basic steps can be used to bring more possibilities to the future.

For more information, please ""click"" the upon logo link.
""Mark 1 Robot"" received many positive comments and compliments from the media and online platforms about its great performance. It has moveable body joints, face-tracking eyeballs with built-in-camera, voice recognition, and text-to-speech capabilities. All ten fingers can operate independently, and its face allows for a rich variety of expressions and sing a song too!


Life-like robot application in business market:
1. School Tutorial2. Shopping malls, hotel reception 3. Celebrity and movie star model museum 4. Fashion robotic for window display 5. Festivals decoration 6. Movie special effect 7. Medical research 8. Games of character




 





Risks & Challenges
Robots on human help and significance?
With the economic changes in society, human will tend to high-tech electronic or network work; life quality will change and improve. The high-risk, long-term, high-accuracy, disgusting and bothersome work and the relative lack of manpower are also problems that the community will face.
Robot science, reduce human duplication of work, improve working hours. As the AI function can help the general public in business, it can through the “VR” technology and remote control robotic to attend the meeting or visit the business environment.
In the hospital, it can help doctors and nurses to assist in surgery. 24 hours (face recognition) to monitor the safety of the home, to take care of the elderly and children, the daily guidance and teaching, household cleaning, 24 hours (face recognition) to monitor the spread of infection, the patient 24 hours of continuous care.
Other applications, through “VR” technology, can be used for outbound travel and business trip. In the field of rental services, high-risk work, there are different industries, there are still infinite possibilities.
Why do we need to understand and learn robot knowledge?
Global economic power, understand the robot technology will have a long-term human and economic impact, so that over the years, invested over 100 billions in robot research and development.
""Global spending on robots will grow from $ 71 billion in year 2015 to $ 135.4 billion in year 2019. The regional developments in 2015, Asia Pacific (including Japan) accounted for 65% of robot-related investment, followed by Europe and the Middle East, the America is third.
Nearly a decade, robots around the world science and technology, although there, but still in the research and development stage. ""Robots are one of the core technologies driving the transformation of tomorrow's manufacturing, and more and more robots are moving into different areas, such as electronics, healthcare, retail, and logistics,"" according to IDC's new International Business Robotics Guide. Agriculture, services, education and government.
Therefore, I believe that after the basic study of the book, the future of the robot industry came, we will more likely to invest in new industries and share the benefits of new technology and economy.
Robot of the industrial cycle?
This project, like Karl Friedrich Benz, a 100-year-old Wright brothers (1867) and a gas-powered invention, still affects society and the country's economy to this day. There is a long-term development and will not be replaced by the main reason, the sooner the development will only grasp the future of new industrial status; the robot in the case of continuous optimization, its life cycle will only be longer.
Will robots affect the national economy?
Due to the birth of the new robot industry, the related industries such as mechanical motor, electronics, plastics, metal, etc., will bring greater business opportunities.
National economy, business and industry are a direct impact on the local finance, property and tourism. The reason is that the good production of goods, it will bring the national economy with business opportunities, in addition to people's consumption to increase the country's own money flow, exporting also increase national income. Prosperity, but also the financial, property, tourism, the opportunity to bring prosperity.
Human fear of the emergence of robots?
As for human fear of the robot, it same as ancient primitive people afraid of fire. Also in early, we fear the radio box has a human voice, the camera will absorb the soul, etc. Now a day, it changed our conceptions already. As for applications, such as early pagers to the present mobile phone, or early computers such as closet-like to the present Pocket PC, it will have more possibilities, and then have more opportunities for optimization , and finally to universal access to the world.
Back to the past history, scientific progress, raising the new economy, improve the human life quality and improve the environment. The new economy, nor is it suddenly appeared. We don’t afraid if catch the science and technology. Therefore, mankind will only gradually enter another work level.
Why it is difficult to mass production and application in the market?
In global market, it appeared hundreds design concept prototype robots, but why cannot be perfected for mass production!
1. Only to solve about maintain, professional staff and tools which all are the problems the manufacturers should face to.
2. High tax and expensive delivery cost for exporting robot.
3. Luxury consumer items just able to be afforded by rich group. How to make it popularize?  How to decrease the production cost to public can pay?  That is the question about egg and chicken!
4. Actually robot still in development, that is the point it may not for on sale in the market. 
Why human-like robotic type will be popular then others?
For Environment
The reason why robots use a human height and shape, it is not only flexible, it can do multi-task. Moreover, it does not take up too much space. We do not need to change or tailor-made facilities to fit the robotic size. Because of the proportion of adult height is based on the human. Therefore, it can apply be more and flexible than the other types.
For Using
At the same time, we should depend on the user's ability to develop the robotic. Body size is too large or too small, the relative energy consumption is large or inadequate, if the power supply is exhausted or damaged and fall down, our body can bear their weight, which is also an important consideration or we may be injured or have a greater risk .
For Psychological
We can imagine that space research vacation in future, only a robot and human, you will choose human-like or metal as shape robotic for space trip?
The most important point is the human-like type can wear different jackets to change the outlook or shape to fulfill the different works, but the metal type is impossible to do this.
The above three issues, many robotic types in the world, it should become to one type. For example, in the past few years, people have used the human form of robot to be the hotel reception, window display, education and human-like robotic movie in Japan. Therefore, this type of future development, must save a lot of time to consideration.",24.0,4,"1 Campaign

<h3><strong>What BodyTalk Is</strong></h3>
<p>In 1995, Dr. John Veltheim - an Australian, who ran a busy clinic for Chinese medicine, acupuncture, chiropractic and naturopathy in Melbourne for 15 years - introduced BodyTalk, a revolutionary healthcare system that uses state-of-the-art energy medicine to optimize the body’s internal communications and allow it to more effectively respond to injury and illness. Since then, the BodyTalk System has been taught to more than a thousand practitioners around the world.</p>
<p>BodyTalk is an integrative healing modality that focuses on the root of the problems rather than addressing the symptoms. A BodyTalk practitioner is trained to understand what your body is saying and then addresses the problems on physical, emotional, psychological, and energetic levels.</p>
<p>Clinical results have shown that once the communications systems of the body have been reestablished, and the bodymind complex synchronized, the body is capable of healing itself at a deep and lasting level.</p>
<p>That is why today there are nearly 1,400 Certified BodyTalk Practitioners in over 40 countries, treating people across the globe and from all walks of life, from professional athletes looking for a competitive edge to poor communities desperately in need of affordable healthcare. UK’s The Telegraph stated that <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/alternative-medicine/7044474/BodyTalk-Could-a-new-therapy-be-the-answer-to-all-your-aches-and-pains.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Barack Obama and Oprah Winfrey may use BodyTalk</a>. </p>
<p>Significantly, even if a BodyTalk technique is performed incorrectly, it simply means that there will be no result or change. It will not make things worse. It follows, therefore, that anyone who receives BodyTalk has nothing to lose and everything to gain as far as his or her health is concerned.</p>
<p>Indeed, every person who is sincerely interested in the concept of total healthcare and has a respect for the power of the potential of human body-mind, should find out more about the BodyTalk System.</p>
<p>Visit <i><a href=""http://www.bodytalksystem.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.bodytalksystem.com</a></i> today. It will change the way you look at healthcare forever.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Who We Are</strong></h3>
<p>We are a group of Indonesian people who have been practicing BodyTalk Fundamentals in the last few years. We have been supported by Practitioner’s Development Project, started by LAA Inc. We would like to share the awareness of healthcare by introducing BodyTalk to at least 1,000 people of academic society, such as lecturers, teachers, staff, students or even parents. BodyTalk is growing tremendously and more people are interested to experience this modality. We are very passionate at introducing BodyTalk to everyone, especially after seeing the amazing outcomes from BodyTalk sessions. Starting in April 2016, we've started introducing BodyTalk by giving public presentation in schools and giving free sessions to a number of teachers, staff and students. So far we have excellent feedback and we are planning to do more presentation in more schools, even outside of the city and that's why we need funding to realise this dream.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Why We Are On Indiegogo</strong></h3>
<p>Indonesia is a developing country where 28.6 million of its citizens live below the poverty line and over 100 million remain clustered around the national poverty line set at $22.60 per person per month. The GDP per capita or annual earning of an individual in Indonesia is $ 3,600, which is earning $300/month and yet have to feed the whole family.

<p>We would like to come to schools, introduce BodyTalk and teach Cortices technique so it can be applied to the students on a routine basis. Based on the conditions explained above, surely we could not force them to pay for it. Therefore, we want to spread his modality to as many people as we can, to increase their well-being without spending a lot of money. Our main goal is to support teaching learning process, as well as managing stress, improving focus and performance for lecturers, teachers, staff and students.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>What We Do</strong></h3>
<p>Our plan is to visit at least 15 schools in a year, with 2 batches for each school, and teach Cortices to approximately 30 participants in each batch. Thus, 1,000 people in a year. Right now most of our team members are based in Jakarta, so it is our focus at this time. However, we have already had a plan to visit some schools in neighboring cities in West Java every other month.</p>

<p>There has been a number of research of the impact of BodyTalk techniques, done in countries around the world.  Research has been done in many schools, concerning the learning process on students. Studies showed that: the “after” results are mostly comparable with the “before” scores. The most significant differences were found in reading, writing &amp; spelling. Although individual children responded differently in the different criteria, there was in general an overall improvement. As is expected (from the theory and philosophy of BodyTalk) each individual has unique reactions to environmental stressors and so variation is expected. The teachers rating were in general higher suggesting that they were more stringent, whilst the parents were more lenient in their assessments.</p>

<h3>Exclusive opportunity to help recreate and remaster Concorde's original Flying Manuals, so perfect, you could fly from them!</h3>
<p>Concorde, arguably one of the biggest icons of aviation history was retired from service in October 2003 and made its final flight on Wednesday the 26th November 2003 after a career spanning just 27 years in commercial service. Relatively short if you consider that some other icons of aviation history such as the Boeing 747 Jumbo Jet and its little brother the Boeing 737 'Pocket Rocket', both remain in service today , despite entering service before Concorde!<br/><br/>Such is the love and admiration for this aircraft, that despite its retirement nearly 13 years ago, people still have a fascination and a love of this historic aviation masterpiece. Many still collect memorabilia and talk with passion about this, the world's only supersonic passenger airliner.<br/><br/>As a lover of this icon too, and someone who flies, I've always been fascinated by aircraft Flying Manuals used by pilots, and especially Concorde. These manuals were limited in number, to one set per aircraft and so very few sets actually exist. Each pilot had their own set too, controlled copies, but again, still only those that got to fly this awesome beast, received them.<br/><br/>The manuals are;</p>
<ul>
<li>Flying Manual Vol. 1</li>
<li>Flying Manual Vol. 2a</li>
<li>Flying Manual Vol. 2b</li>
</ul>

Using original documents for reference, creating each page from scratch, word for word and page by page. Making brand-new vectored graphics for the diagrams and charts, taking brand new photos where applicable, replacing original photos contained and referenced within the manuals, ending up with a painstakingly accurate, remastered, replica of the original flying manuals. No photocopied images, no photocopied charts and graphs, and no photocopied graphics. Everything recreated with immense attention to detail and precision.<br/><br/>When these documents have been completed, they would be so accurate that if Concorde were ever to fly again, you could use these manuals for flight - something normally forbidden. They will look like they were the 'Master Copies' of the document in fact.</p>

A. Mace argued that  ""Perhaps the most important discoveries are those which relate to the appropriate distribution of the periods of study...Acts of revision should be spaced in gradually increasing intervals, roughly intervals of one day, two days, four days, eight days, and so on.""  Subsequent research supports his argument that review is more effective with this technique.</p><p style=""margin-left:40px;"">It makes sense that a child needs less review for sounds they remember well and that challenging the child to recall after increasing intervals is a better measure of learning.  I cannot imagine trying to remember not only whether a child knows the letter but also how well they recall the sound and when it was last reviewed.

<br/> </h3></div>","After 15 years working with children in Montessori environments I am interested in building a tool for Guides to improve the effectiveness of Sandpaper Letter Presentations.As a Guide it is helpful to know which sandpaper letters a child already knows, which letters have been presented but not mastered, and which have never been presented: 26 pieces of data for each child.  30 children in an environment is (26 x 30 = ) 780 discrete pieces of data to remember or record and access.Over the years I have tried a variety of systems including note cards for each child, a letter size paper with a table containing data for all children in the environment and even a laissez-faire approach in which no records were kept and each presentation began with reviewing all letters until we found three for that day.  I think there is a better system.I think that a good tool makes the work more effective - a shovel digs a hole better than my hands,  a stove is more convenient than cooking on a fire everyday, and gps directions are better than the directions from the gas station attendant.I want a tool, an android app, for Guides that enhances the effectiveness of Sandpaper Letter presentations.  This app will only be useful to Guides and will be not be appropriate for children.An app can harness technologies that will enhance effectiveness in the following ways: Improves reviews of previously presented lettersAn app can harness the computing power of databases and algorithms to support Spaced Learning.  In 1932 in the book Psychology of Study, Prof. C. A. Mace argued that  ""Perhaps the most important discoveries are those which relate to the appropriate distribution of the periods of study...Acts of revision should be spaced in gradually increasing intervals, roughly intervals of one day, two days, four days, eight days, and so on.""  Subsequent research supports his argument that review is more effective with this technique.It makes sense that a child needs less review for sounds they remember well and that challenging the child to recall after increasing intervals is a better measure of learning.  I cannot imagine trying to remember not only whether a child knows the letter but also how well they recall the sound and when it was last reviewed. I shudder at the thought of the complications and confusion inherent in a paper based record keeping with this level of specificity.However, an app using an algorithm can adjust the review intervals such that more challenging letters appear for review more often and letters that are easily recalled are presented less often.  The difficulty is defined by the Guide based on observation of how easily the child recalls the correct sound for the letter.The Guide tells the app if it was difficult for the child to remember and the app does the hard part of scheduling and remembering review intervals. Improved selection of letter groups for Three Period LessonsIn my training it was advised that in any three period lesson we should begin with greatest differences first and gradually work towards smaller differences.  This is why the geometry cabinet begins with a presentation of circle, square, and triangle as opposed to three circles of different diameters.Of course a vowel is always included in each grouping until all vowels are learned - but what about all the consonants?  I try to intentionally select the letters to maintain maximal difference, but I invariably end up presenting similar letters at some point (such as G, C, D).The University of Iowa published a fantastic site called Sounds of Speech that groups letters according to the manner of articulation which “refers to how the sound is produced and the way in which the airstream is modified as it passes through the vocal tract.”  Sounds are labeled as a STOP, FRICATIVE, AFFRICATE, NASAL, LIQUID, or GLIDE. Sounds that have the same manner of articulation have the most similar sounds.An app can utilize an algorithm to suggest letters from different manners of articulation to maximize differences in every presentation.  I can imaginea paper-based system to accomplish this goal, but I think a database and algorithm will do the work better and faster. A WORD ABOUT TECHNOLOGY AND DEVICESAlthough I do not advocate the use of digital technologies and devices by children in a Primary environment, I do recognize that these are powerful tools and ubiquitous in our modern lives.  I believe that an important aspect of the Guide’s duty is to model appropriate use of technology with Grace and Courtesy. I believe that removing a minor concern (not safety related) from the environment also removes the opportunity to educate children about how to appropriately approach the concern. What We Need to Make it HappenAll funds will pay for the Indiegogo fees and the labor/expertise of Aaron Dunigan AtLee who will write and test the code for the Sandpaper Letter App.   Aaron based his labor estimates on experience with previous coding projects and confirmed these estimates with the calculators at https://estimatemyapp.com/ and http://howmuchtomakeanapp.com/.What You GetIf the project is fully funded you will receive perks or rewards based on your funding level.  See PERKS.The Android app will be sold online when it is completed and most of the perks involve receiving complimentary a download of the app.  The donation is less than it will cost in the store, so you are essentially pre-ordering the app at a discount!If the project does not reach its goal your donation will be refunded by Indiegogo in 5-7 business days after the project deadline.  There is no risk for you - either you get an app or your money back.If we raise funds beyond our goal amount we will use the additional funds for any unexpected expenses and to explore options for an iOS (Apple) App, cloud storage, and integration with existing online record keeping systems such as Transparent Classroom. Spread the WordOur project has Montessori expertise (Ed Stanford) and Coding expertise (Aaron Dunigan AtLee) and a vision for a tool to enhance the effectiveness of Sandpaper Letter Presentations.Here are your next stepsImagine how the children would benefit from learning the Sandpaper Letters easier and faster!Pledge funds to the project!Tell your colleagues, co-workers, friends, and community about this project.

<b><i>Shifting
the perception of school exclusion</i></b>
</h3>
<h3><b><br/></b></h3><div>
<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">**Important note: the event and campaign has been postponed due to unforeseen circumstances . Please note that we will be back in the Spring to </span><b>give you a show of epic proportions. If you want to speak to us in the meantime - please get in touch: events@cenlive.org</b>
</div><div><b>Thanks for all of your support,</b></div><div><b>The CEN team!</b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><div><b><br/></b></div><h3><b>Our campaign</b></h3>
<p>
On
the 21st October 2015,  the Communities Empowerment
Network (CEN) and Island Records are taking over London's Camden Roundhouse. Our aim is to bring together artists, speakers and supporters to expel misconceptions around school exclusion. You'll get to see <b>Jermain Jackman</b>, <b>Ayanna Witter-Johnson</b>, <b>The British Collective</b> and exclusive performances from <b>Island Records artists</b>, all giving their time to help our cause (please see line up below). The money we
raise will be used to grow our charity and support our vision that
families and children will always have somewhere to turn when faced
with issues at school, and that every child has the opportunity to fulfil their potential.</p>
<h3>The story</h3>
<p>
We
all want our kids to grow up to be a success. If your child could be
the next Eric Clapton, Lewis Hamilton, or even Albert Einstein you'd
be happy. Right? </p>
<p>
But
all three were excluded from school:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
<b>Eric
	Clapton -</b> not handing in enough work due to spending his time playing guitar and listening to the blues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Lewis
	Hamilton -</b> wrongly accused of involvement in a fight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<b>Albert
	Einstein <i>-</i> </b>disruptive
	in class because he only wanted to study Maths and didn't see the
	point in other subjects.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Think
about your own time at school. Does it sound like you? Or a friend?</p>
<p>
Some are lucky. Some bounce back better than others. Some have the support
of family and strong networks. Some are geniuses.</p>
<p>
But
what if your child was excluded from school tomorrow? Would you know
what to do? Who to contact? Would you have the confidence to take on
a system heavily stacked against you?</p>
<p>
This
is the world that CEN, its advocates and its volunteers face on a
daily basis. We work with over 1,000 parents each year who are
fighting for the best outcomes for their children. They need help and
in the current climate,  there is a decreasing number of places to find it. We are currently dealing with the tip of the iceberg but we're growing and we need your support. </p>
<h3><b>What
happens to families who can't get help?</b></h3>
<p>
Martin
Narey, former Director General of the Prison Service:</p><p>“<i>The 13,000 children being excluded from school each year might as well be given a ticket to join the prison system some time later on down the line.”</i></p>
<p>
Dr
Mary Bousted, General Secretary of the Association of Teachers and
Lecturers:</p>
<p>
“<i>Permanent
exclusions are a tragedy for those children and their families and we
must find a way to prevent so many from facing exclusion from
school.”</i></p>
<p>
As
adults, we love reading about mavericks – those who test
boundaries, who do things differently, whose talents we aspire to.</p>
<p>
We
promote them at work, we cheer them at sporting events, we applaud
them at concerts and festivals. Yet at school, increasingly we tell them
to keep quiet, tuck in their shirts and conform. But they're young
people. Young people who need to learn to explore boundaries and
fulfil their potential. To go on to be the people who we so love.
Yes there will be problems, but as adults it's surely our responsibility to
support them and help them grow. Should we not support their free spirit
in the same way we do the mavericks we so admire?</p>
<h3><b>Expelling
Misconceptions</b></h3>
<p>
We
all know the media narrative. These are ""bad kids"" who just
want to ""disrupt"" everyone else in the class. To ""stop
them learning"". They're ""unruly teenagers who don't care"".
Kick them out. Let them pay for their mistakes.</p>
<p>
But
what about:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
	Our
	youngest client J who at the age of 4 is being excluded because the
	school struggle with his disability?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	M
	who has short term memory problems and may well be excluded because
	he shouts answers before he forgets them but often does not raise his
	hand first?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
	Or
	K whose parents split up and he's struggling to deal with the
	situation, causing him to misbehave in class because he's so upset?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
What
if we told you that 7 out of every 10 children excluded have special
educational needs? <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/dec/19/special-needs-permanent-exclusions-school"" rel=""noopener nofollow""></a><a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/dec/19/special-needs-permanent-exclusions-school"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">(see article)</a></p>
<p>
Do
these examples expel some of your own misconceptions?</p>
<p>
Young
people who face issues at school can go on to be successful. Even Sir Richard Branson dropped out of school. His headmaster at the exclusive Stowe school told him he’d either end up in prison or become a millionaire. He was wrong on both counts; Branson is a billionaire. </p><p></p><p>CEN passionately believes that these square pegs in round holes deserve a closer look, a re-evaluation and a second chance. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440433809/ipqvqnxwtwmpf1kdnt5j.png"" src="""" style=""width: 444.508474576271px; height: 248px;""/></p><br/>
<h3><b>Our charity</b></h3>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps you have not heard of us? Since 1999, CEN has been fighting for the educational rights of children and providing support to their families. Success for us is often simply having been there for a family at a time of crisis. It's a tough system to crack and one in which ""winning"" has very different parameters, but we continue to do our best with limited resources. 80% of our parents feel more confident about their child's future education after working with us and we're incredibly proud of that, given the challenges of the system.  </p><p>We have received fantastic support from our funders and supporters who include; Big Lottery, Esme Fairbairn, Children in Need, Santander, The Henry Smith charity, John Lyon's charity and Salesforce. Without their belief and backing, thousands of parents would have been left without support. But we want to grow our funds and have the ability to scale our work and support more families around the UK without relying on grants. It's a long term vision but it's our passion and it starts with this campaign and your help.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1440408944/d3hhyqdmv18fp33yb6oa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><b style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;""><br/></b></p><p><b style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;"">Charity founders </b></p><p><b style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;""></b></p><p><span style=""font-size: 24px; letter-spacing: 0px; line-height: 30px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: initial;""></span></p><p>If you've watched our video, you'll have seen Gus John and Deuan German talk about the issues of exclusion. </p>

<h3><b>Perks</b></h3>
<p>
<b>
</b></p>
<p>Obviously you’re mainly thinking of contributing to help the
charity, but as a thank you we’re going to give you some great rewards in
return (because we are really grateful for your support).</p>
<p>Firstly there are a number of ticket packages. If you’re

<h3>Risks
</h3>
<p>
With
a sponsor like Island Records, there is no doubt that the event is going
to happen. The main risk we have is that it appeals to concert goers
more than people who are genuinely interested in the subjects of
school exclusion and education reform.</p>
<p>
This
isn’t about holding a concert so we can all have a rave in the
Roundhouse. This is about using a high profile event at a prestigious
venue to make the national media and general public aware of what we
are doing. We need to raise enough money to enable CEN to meet the
increasing demand for our services in London and to help build
satellites of CEN to deal with the growing number of cases that are
referred to us from outside London. </p>

Shifting
the perception of school exclusion


**Important note: the event and campaign has been postponed due to unforeseen circumstances . Please note that we will be back in the Spring to give you a show of epic proportions. If you want to speak to us in the meantime - please get in touch: events@cenlive.org
Thanks for all of your support,The CEN team!Our campaign

On
the 21st October 2015,  the Communities Empowerment
Network (CEN) and Island Records are taking over London's Camden Roundhouse. Our aim is to bring together artists, speakers and supporters to expel misconceptions around school exclusion. You'll get to see Jermain Jackman, Ayanna Witter-Johnson, The British Collective and exclusive performances from Island Records artists, all giving their time to help our cause (please see line up below). The money we
raise will be used to grow our charity and support our vision that
families and children will always have somewhere to turn when faced
with issues at school, and that every child has the opportunity to fulfil their potential.
The story

We
all want our kids to grow up to be a success. If your child could be
the next Eric Clapton, Lewis Hamilton, or even Albert Einstein you'd
be happy. Right? 

But
all three were excluded from school:



Eric
	Clapton - not handing in enough work due to spending his time playing guitar and listening to the blues.



Lewis
	Hamilton - wrongly accused of involvement in a fight.



Albert
	Einstein - disruptive
	in class because he only wanted to study Maths and didn't see the
	point in other subjects.



Think
about your own time at school. Does it sound like you? Or a friend?

Some are lucky. Some bounce back better than others. Some have the support
of family and strong networks. Some are geniuses.

But
what if your child was excluded from school tomorrow? Would you know
what to do? Who to contact? Would you have the confidence to take on
a system heavily stacked against you?

This
is the world that CEN, its advocates and its volunteers face on a
daily basis. We work with over 1,000 parents each year who are
fighting for the best outcomes for their children. They need help and
in the current climate,  there is a decreasing number of places to find it. We are currently dealing with the tip of the iceberg but we're growing and we need your support. 
What
happens to families who can't get help?

Martin
Narey, former Director General of the Prison Service:“The 13,000 children being excluded from school each year might as well be given a ticket to join the prison system some time later on down the line.”

Dr
Mary Bousted, General Secretary of the Association of Teachers and
Lecturers:

“Permanent
exclusions are a tragedy for those children and their families and we
must find a way to prevent so many from facing exclusion from
school.”

As
adults, we love reading about mavericks – those who test
boundaries, who do things differently, whose talents we aspire to.

We
promote them at work, we cheer them at sporting events, we applaud
them at concerts and festivals. Yet at school, increasingly we tell them
to keep quiet, tuck in their shirts and conform. But they're young
people. Young people who need to learn to explore boundaries and
fulfil their potential. To go on to be the people who we so love.
Yes there will be problems, but as adults it's surely our responsibility to
support them and help them grow. Should we not support their free spirit
in the same way we do the mavericks we so admire?
Expelling
Misconceptions

We
all know the media narrative. These are ""bad kids"" who just
want to ""disrupt"" everyone else in the class. To ""stop
them learning"". They're ""unruly teenagers who don't care"".
Kick them out. Let them pay for their mistakes.

But
what about:



	Our
	youngest client J who at the age of 4 is being excluded because the
	school struggle with his disability?



	M
	who has short term memory problems and may well be excluded because
	he shouts answers before he forgets them but often does not raise his
	hand first?



	Or
	K whose parents split up and he's struggling to deal with the
	situation, causing him to misbehave in class because he's so upset?



What
if we told you that 7 out of every 10 children excluded have special
educational needs? (see article)

Do
these examples expel some of your own misconceptions?

Young
people who face issues at school can go on to be successful. Even Sir Richard Branson dropped out of school. His headmaster at the exclusive Stowe school told him he’d either end up in prison or become a millionaire. He was wrong on both counts; Branson is a billionaire. CEN passionately believes that these square pegs in round holes deserve a closer look, a re-evaluation and a second chance. 
Our charity

Perhaps you have not heard of us? Since 1999, CEN has been fighting for the educational rights of children and providing support to their families. Success for us is often simply having been there for a family at a time of crisis. It's a tough system to crack and one in which ""winning"" has very different parameters, but we continue to do our best with limited resources. 80% of our parents feel more confident about their child's future education after working with us and we're incredibly proud of that, given the challenges of the system.  We have received fantastic support from our funders and supporters who include; Big Lottery, Esme Fairbairn, Children in Need, Santander, The Henry Smith charity, John Lyon's charity and Salesforce. Without their belief and backing, thousands of parents would have been left without support. But we want to grow our funds and have the ability to scale our work and support more families around the UK without relying on grants. It's a long term vision but it's our passion and it starts with this campaign and your help.Charity founders If you've watched our video, you'll have seen Gus John and Deuan German talk about the issues of exclusion. 
Professor John, a founder of the charity,  is an award-winning writer, education campaigner, consultant, lecturer and researcher. He has completed notable work in the fields of education policy, management and international development. He is an expert in his field, dedicated to fighting for equality and is an inspiration to all who meet him. 
Deuan is the Strategic Director of CEN. He first spent 15 years playing in and managing, a 10 piece ska/reggae/funk band whose aim was to explore the globe off the beaten track, whilst bringing joy, unity and exuberance to wherever they played (from prisons to festivals). Since 1999, after receiving a request from his father the late Gerry German (founder of CEN), Deuan has played an integral part in running and developing the charity.Your event

Expelling
Misconceptions will raise the profile of CEN within the UK,
highlighting the issues behind school exclusions and the
vulnerability of many unfairly excluded children. We are holding an
event that celebrates creative artistry and will enable us to grow
our charity, scale up and raise our profile across the UK, in order to support many more families.

You'll
spend the evening at the incredible Camden Roundhouse, learn about
our work, have a drink or two and meet some fantastic people. In return for your support, you will receive exclusive performances from:  Jermain Jackman, NCS ambassador and winner of BBC's The Voice 2014

Ayanna Witter-Johnson, cellist, vocalist and pioneer of Black folk musicThe British Collective, a supergroup of some of Britain's biggest male R&B iconsPlus EXCLUSIVE performance from Island records artists to be confirmed...
We've worked incredibly hard to secure artists and speakers that share our passion to give you a night that you'll remember - the type of event you'd go to even if it wasn't for a charity. But it is. 

Our
team will be there and we'd love to meet you and share our stories.
Your support will not only buy you a great night out but also the
fantastic feeling that you've made a difference to the life of a
young person and their family. It is a contribution that might just
see a new Clapton, Hamilton or Einstein supported rather than
abandoned. You could be part of that. Event detailsWhen: Wednesday October 21st 2015Where: The Camden Roundhouse Getting to the venue: Click here for details.Times: Doors open at 7pm and the fun begins around 8pm. We will be all done and dusted by 11pm.

steal at £17 a ticket (booking fee included), so it is a cheap gig, and the bonus is that you are donating money to charity. If you miss out on the early tickets don’t worry, you’re still getting an amazing deal to see all of these artists, but with added feel-good factor.
Thinking of buying VIP tickets? Do it. Splash out. You won’t

<h3>
			What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<h4>
			What Do We Need?</h4>
<p>
			We have to make this game in a factory for at least 1000 sets. We hope to share these game sets to 

people all over the world. To achieve this goal, we need your support. You may:</p>
<ul>
<li>
				get a perk, so you can have our game set too.</li>
<li>
				donate for us, and schools can be benefited with a free game set by you.</li>
<li>
				share this project to your friends, especially those who are students, parents and 

teachers.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
			What Can You Get?</h4>
<p>
			You can get our game sets or Factor Rulers as a souvenir.</p>
<h4>
			How the fund be used?</h4>
<p>
			The game include 56 “number cards”, 22 “character cards”, 108 “toy 

treasure”(see notes below), an A5 size instruction manual, a 9cm x 12cm bag for holding those “toy 

treasure” and a box to keep all material tidy.</p><p style=""text-align: center;""></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449849843/wlfqw8pjqzhmnsw5mxrb.png"" src="""" style=""width: 400px; height: 396px;""/></p><br/>
<p>
			Notes for “toy treasure”: we add this because a hunter game can motivate boys more than 

girls, so we add these element in order to attract girls to play. You know, children are attracted to concrete objects than 

abstract concept.</p>

<h3>
			“Factor hunter” is a great game because:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
				it can engage students with different ability,</li>
<li>
				it provide visualize the relationship of factor and multiple between number,</li>
<li>
				the cards in this game are good teaching aids for teacher,</li>
<li>
				it provide emotional experience (the game is very exciting, even for adult) of learning 

mathematics concepts to students,</li>
<li>
				it is a relatively cheap and very effective method to drill mathematics exercises in 

related topics compare to hiring a tutor.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
			What can “Factor hunter” achieve?</h3>
<p>
			“Factor hunter” engage players in using the concept of multiplication, division, 

factor, multiple, logic and number theory.  We want to mass produce this broad game so that students over the world 

can enjoy it.</p>
<p>
			There are still more teaching goals that “Factor hunter” can achieve:</p>
<ol>
<li>
				Build up the number sense related to factors and multiples.</li>
<li>
				Familiar with the fact that 1 is the common factor of all numbers.</li>
<li>
				Practice the concept of multiple and factor.</li>
<li>
				Familiar with multiplication from 1 to 11.</li>
<li>
				Familiar with concept of intersection and union of two sets.</li>
<li>
				May use “proof by contradiction” (When prove when some player play 

wrongly).</li>
<li>
				Use theorem in number theory ""given that <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> relatively prime, if <i>m</i> and <i>n</i> are 

factor of <i>k</i>, then <i>mn</i> is also a factor of <i>k</i>"" (When they guess the character card).</li>
<li>
				Use theorem in number theory ""given that m is a factor of n and n is a factor of p, 

then m is also a factor of p"" (When issuing number cards that will not disclose more about his character card)</li>
<li>
				Use of logical thinking to get advantage in the game (When finding the character 

card).</li>

Factor Hunter is an exciting mathematics card game for age 8 to adults to learn 

factor and multiple.

			What We Need & What You Get

			What Do We Need?

			We have to make this game in a factory for at least 1000 sets. We hope to share these game sets to 

people all over the world. To achieve this goal, we need your support. You may:


				get a perk, so you can have our game set too.

				donate for us, and schools can be benefited with a free game set by you.

				share this project to your friends, especially those who are students, parents and 

teachers.


			What Can You Get?

			You can get our game sets or Factor Rulers as a souvenir.

			How the fund be used?

			The game include 56 “number cards”, 22 “character cards”, 108 “toy 

treasure”(see notes below), an A5 size instruction manual, a 9cm x 12cm bag for holding those “toy 

treasure” and a box to keep all material tidy.

			Notes for “toy treasure”: we add this because a hunter game can motivate boys more than 

girls, so we add these element in order to attract girls to play. You know, children are attracted to concrete objects than 

abstract concept.
      

			“Factor hunter” is a great game because:


				it can engage students with different ability,

				it provide visualize the relationship of factor and multiple between number,

				the cards in this game are good teaching aids for teacher,

				it provide emotional experience (the game is very exciting, even for adult) of learning 

mathematics concepts to students,

				it is a relatively cheap and very effective method to drill mathematics exercises in 

related topics compare to hiring a tutor.


			What can “Factor hunter” achieve?

			“Factor hunter” engage players in using the concept of multiplication, division, 

factor, multiple, logic and number theory.  We want to mass produce this broad game so that students over the world 

can enjoy it.

			There are still more teaching goals that “Factor hunter” can achieve:


				Build up the number sense related to factors and multiples.

				Familiar with the fact that 1 is the common factor of all numbers.

				Practice the concept of multiple and factor.

				Familiar with multiplication from 1 to 11.

				Familiar with concept of intersection and union of two sets.

				May use “proof by contradiction” (When prove when some player play 

wrongly).

				Use theorem in number theory ""given that m and n relatively prime, if m and n are 

factor of k, then mn is also a factor of k"" (When they guess the character card).

				Use theorem in number theory ""given that m is a factor of n and n is a factor of p, 

then m is also a factor of p"" (When issuing number cards that will not disclose more about his character card)

				Use of logical thinking to get advantage in the game (When finding the character 

card).




			Who can benefit from”Factor hunter”

			What we want to achieve is not just producing a card game, but also foster an environment of 

pleasurable learning. With proper promotion, We hope this game can help:


				About 700,000,000 Primary school Students: 

showing them learning can be enjoyable,
Their Parents: building 

relationship by playing,

				Low income families: help them to educating their children,

				About 20,000,000 Homeschooling parents: provide a good options for,


				School management of 300,000 primary 

school: help schools to maintain a pleasurable learning atmosphere.




How can you help bringing this great game to children?The most direct way to help is to take a perk. Also, you can share this project with any parents, friends with children, students, teachers and anyone who are enthusiastic about education by Facebook, Twitter or email.
Stretch Goals:





US$10,000:

We deliver 10 sets of premium packages to public schools free of charge.




US$20,000:

We deliver 25 MORE sets of premium packages to public schools free of charge.

US$50,000:

We deliver 65 MORE sets of premium packages to public schools free of charge.
US$100,000:

We put the card game into the public domain, that means anyone can make it without violating the copyright issue!How to play:

This video demonstrate how to play Factor Hunter

A. Setting Up



				Deal five cards to each player.

				Stack any remaining number cards face-up in the middle of the table as drawing stack.

				Deal a character card to each player.

				Stack any remaining character cards face-up in the middle of the table as another 

stack.

B. Start Round - Attack

				Choose arbitrary player be the first attacker or the next player be attacker.

				The attacker player pulls one card that is a factor of his base or he can pulls pass card 

which can be reused (because he has no card to pull or he don't want to pull any card).

C. Continue Round - Guess

				After attacker pulled a card, player on his left can guess the number of attacker 

base.

				If a player guess wrongly, two treasure will be destroyed immediately.

				If correct, that player can award number of treasure shown on the cards pulled by the 

attacker and get the character card from the attacker and can use the special ability shown in the character cards 

once.
After that, this round finished and the next player starts another round by repeating step B1.


D. Continue Round - Pass

				If a player cannot guess the number of attacker, he can pass.

				If all player pass, all player except attacker should give 1 treasure to attacker.
After that, this round finished and the next player starts another round by repeating step B1.

E. Special Situation - Attacker Pass, Wrong Cards

				If the attacker choose to pass, all defender can guess

				If an attack pull out wrong card (say, his base is 5, but he give out 3 to attack), and if 

any other player correctly Point out that, he can award 5 * numbers of attacker's card.

F. End Game

When any player get 3 character cards, the game end. The player with most gems will be the winner.",4.0,3,"1 Campaign

Some time ago I knew a person like that. He was a tennis coach. He wanted to create a sophisticated system to use during a tennis tournament
and he wasn't able to do so. I created it for him. And that is the difference between a CMS* user and a software developer.
During this course you will gain developer skills. You
will not be using any CMS. You will create every piece of application by yourself. 
What is really priceless is the explanation on how to
combine different technologies to achieve your goals.
Becouse I found  that the most time consuming thing is to
understand the relations beetwen different technologies, how to combine them, how
to use them together in order to create a fully functional web portal.
You must understand that this course will explain
everything you need to know in order to create your application and will  give you a tremendous amount of knowledge to continue creating web pages in the future as this will not be the end of your journey. 

TimelineTo create this course I need two months. I will start as soon as this campaign goal is reached.
Risks and challengesThe risk is very limited. This course will be created. But as the quality will be the most important factor, it is possible that it could take a bit more than 2 months to create this course. 
Other Ways You Can Help
 
Not interested? Maybe you know someone who might want to support this project. If so, tell them about it.


* full-stack web developer - this is a person who can write any application
component. Not only frontend or backend. So he/she can create the whole
application by himself/herself with no help. 
* CMS - Content Management System - briefly speaking systems like WordPress (you can create a web page without technical knowledge, but only from modules created by technical staff )",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Red Chaski, La Quiaca</h2>
<h3><strong>Faced with the current limitations to bring connectivity to La Quiaca City, we development a project to build a social network through a community intranet which will grow along with the gradual arrival of the internet.</strong></h3>
<p>The social network Chaski will allow the solidary dissemination of educational, technological, and cultural contents as well as the communication among the inhabitants in the city. The users will have the possibility to create and share their own contents, as well as socialize any material they may have obtained from the internet during any temporary connection. Our aim is to create a local means of communication with a strong educational, technological and cultural imprint using the tools available.</p>
<p>The network is being developed with teams specialized in free software.</p>
<h3>
<strong>The city of La Quiaca is located on the northern border of Argentina in the province of Jujuy.  </strong><strong>The city borders Bolivia to the north </strong><strong>and has a population of 16 thousand people. </strong>
</h3>
<p>Due to issues related to infrastructure, topographic constraints and lack of investment from the large telecommunication companies the city has an extremely limited access to internet.</p>
<p>The supply of internet connection is currently 8mb for all the inhabitants; which means that only a very small part of the population can actually hire a low quality service at a very high price.</p>
<p>The main node of our infrastructure will be placed in the State School of Social Management <i>CEIJA IDEAR- </i>Educational, Cultural, and Sports Association ""Abogado Manuel Belgrano"". It is in this premise that there will be a server with all the contents shared by the users as well as the main aerial from which the intranet will be generated using radio-frequency equipment located in different spots in the city.</p>

<h2><strong>Why do we call it <i>Red Chaski</i>?</strong></h2>
<p>The word <i><strong>""chaski""</strong></i> in Quechua (Original pre-columbian Lenguage of La Quiaca) refers to the concept of mail. During the Tahuantinsuyo (Inca empire), <i>Chaskis</i> were the people in charge of delivering messages and parcels for and from the Inca. Since their childhood, <i>chaskis</i> were trained in physical skills and taught about cultural issues and science. These young men had the task to travel on foot along the impressive roads of the Empire. Their long races included various stops on their way, where other young men would take over the task in order to speed up the communication and delivery process. Apart from delivering messages and parcels, <i>chaskis</i> received information and ancestral concepts, passed on from generation to generation, which could be preserved from the Spaniard conquest. </p>

<p>a tactile learning children's book (ages 2-5) without electronics and with a simple premise: <i>believe...and magic happens. </i> </p>
<p>The book begins with a deflated balloon. The reader (children and adults) are asked to inflate the balloon by blowing into it.  (the book is 8.75 x 8.75, so the images below show the book opened). </p>

</div></div>","A balloon that won't float away or pop?
We've got one. It's THIS BALLOON,
a tactile learning children's book (ages 2-5) without electronics and with a simple premise: believe...and magic happens.  
The book begins with a deflated balloon. The reader (children and adults) are asked to inflate the balloon by blowing into it.  (the book is 8.75 x 8.75, so the images below show the book opened). 
So, I know people like to look through a book before they buy it...and here's a link for you to do so! 

So...blow on the balloon...and then turn the page...  
After turning the page, the child sees this: 

What happens if the balloon is pushed too far? Will it float off the page? After turning the page, both pages are filled with this: 

Whoops! Don't worry; THIS balloon won't float away.
What happens if you rub the balloon and say the word ""blue""? 


In This Balloon, simple, wonderful things happen that bring a calming, delightful sense of play, ideal for bedtime reading. Readers get to do LOTS of things with the balloons on the page:

Blow on balloons
Touch balloons
Identify and name colors
Count
Shake the book (gently) 
Rub the pages
Laugh to make things happen
Tilt the book to shift balloons to the other side

This Balloon takes the concept of interactive book and gives it a lift. Children will also be introduced to Oscar, a friendly fellow with a smart-looking green vest and purple tie, who would not only like to play with the balloons, but also has a fun, flying surprise for readers. 


With the child's help, Oscar gets a balloon and goes on a hot-air balloon ride. Oscar even falls asleep, dangling on a crescent moon....and then it's bedtime. But no need to worry. This Balloon will still be there in the morning, tomorrow afternoon, or at bedtime again!

Word-of-MouthWe need your help to get the word out to parents and teachers throughout the country that the cavalry has arrived and OVCA is committed to a major reform of child care and early education.  A reform committed to reducing the cost for parents and improving the pay, benefits and training for teachers.  Please share out Indiegogo Link with your social networks, Parents, grandparents, teachers and child care providers and employers we invite you to join us in making a difference. What You GetSure, we have some great perks, but these are just a physical token of our appreciation.  But, here is the best partHow can I get more involved?  Just email us at Info@OVCAinc.comHow can I get an OVCA Educational Village near me?  OVCA is not a franchise, however, we do partner with local individuals and community members to establish OVCA Educational Villages - this is part of the Rapid Replication program.  Our goal is to reduce parent costs, improve quality education for children and raise teacher pay and training throughout the country.  To do this we need people in local communities to help us.  If you or someone you know wants to help us establish an OVCA Educational Village in your community email us at pdoucette@OVCAinc.com The RisksWe know that we have very ambitious goals.  A child care early education disruption like this had never been attempted.  The rapid replication and scaling of a bricks-n-mortar business has also never been attempted to our knowledge.   But since no one else is trying to make a difference we are going to do our best.  Even if we are not able to open hundreds of OVCA centers, our view of the worst case scenario is:
Each center opened is properly capitalized and will make a positive difference in the lives of the people it serves and the local community 
We will increase public awareness of the problems facing child care and early childhood education and have a platform for advocating for real reform 
The FoundersOur Founders are all successful mid-career professionals from the fields of early childhood education, law, IT, sales, financial services, human resources, real estate, ministry and marketing.   We are all very passionate about OVCA and expanding this unique business model nationally.   Anyone can scale an e-commerce business but only OVCA can scale a bricks-n-mortar business.  Our team has developed a Rapid Replication strategy that can provide the OVCA advantage to children, parents and teachers throughout the country",20.0,0,"1 Campaign

Established internationally since <strong>1995</strong>, first in small scale and growing gradually, the Y-TOP meets several times a year for international gatherings, each time in a different country as volunteering friends from all nations and backgrounds, of all ages, genders and of different cultural beliefs. We gather in a safe and trustful ecology in which we create, learn and explore with great depth, seeking new pathways into the future.  <strong>This year we will be meeting in Portugal in summer 2017 to explore the topic of Natural Human Communication and to volunteer together. Thanks to your contribution the Y-TOP will be ready and will be able to support the Camp, the volunteers and the future development of our growing movement.</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1493223014/kuz3f5rbvd1d3afxlb0f.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p>Since 2012 we have successfully been awarded with the <strong>EU </strong>fundings from<strong> Erasmus Plus</strong> programme for some of our ongoing projects (“Skills for Living” Denmark 2012; “Slinky” Wales  2015; “Now The Doing” Netherlands  2015; “Human Rainforest” Ireland 2016; and many important training gatherings in between).</p><h2>What do we plan?</h2><p>Our next step, without EU support, will be towards a territory we care a lot about... In fact, in such a crucial moment of history, where technology is evolving as fast as psychology, <strong>WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT COMMUNICATION</strong>! ..and not just simple speaking abilities, nor social medias or marketing skills, but true <strong>Natural Human Communication</strong>. By uncovering this, we will be able to connect more and more with one another, to understand each other, maintaining values and aims, fostering qualities and meanings with awareness - and last but-not-least, to stay in touch with ourselves.</p><h2>Why do we ask for support?</h2><p>With <strong>Portugal </strong>being a new country for the Y-TOP we will have lots of challenges.

Within the Y-TOP everyone are engaging in fundraising locally within our native countries, in order to promote our values for what money can do, as well as to increase our teamwork skills and to better understand how finance gives us greater access to options we believe in. In the likely case we will reach and exceed our goal we have so many important projects to further, just waiting for us (and now You!) to grow them and give them life. For instance; The Y-TOPtionary (an evolving dictionary for designing new words of the future), formal and informal educational programs (both stationary and nomads), a  Y-TOP music album (enabling us to share our message through original music) and many other movies, writings, arts, workshops, as well as social, artistic and innovation initiatives to build.</p><h2>The Perks</h2><p>First, please know that we are truly grateful and full of appreciation for your help.

Established internationally since 1995, first in small scale and growing gradually, the Y-TOP meets several times a year for international gatherings, each time in a different country as volunteering friends from all nations and backgrounds, of all ages, genders and of different cultural beliefs. We gather in a safe and trustful ecology in which we create, learn and explore with great depth, seeking new pathways into the future.  This year we will be meeting in Portugal in summer 2017 to explore the topic of Natural Human Communication and to volunteer together. Thanks to your contribution the Y-TOP will be ready and will be able to support the Camp, the volunteers and the future development of our growing movement.Since 2012 we have successfully been awarded with the EU fundings from Erasmus Plus programme for some of our ongoing projects (“Skills for Living” Denmark 2012; “Slinky” Wales  2015; “Now The Doing” Netherlands  2015; “Human Rainforest” Ireland 2016; and many important training gatherings in between).What do we plan?Our next step, without EU support, will be towards a territory we care a lot about... In fact, in such a crucial moment of history, where technology is evolving as fast as psychology, WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT COMMUNICATION! ..and not just simple speaking abilities, nor social medias or marketing skills, but true Natural Human Communication. By uncovering this, we will be able to connect more and more with one another, to understand each other, maintaining values and aims, fostering qualities and meanings with awareness - and last but-not-least, to stay in touch with ourselves.Why do we ask for support?With Portugal being a new country for the Y-TOP we will have lots of challenges. Our summer camp, the volunteers and the youth will need plenty of resources, preparation and management. Arranging displacements, activities and adventures, and also exploring the right places to volunteer to help local communities - something we always do for the countries we visit.To do this we need your help, and we actually like to think that we all need each other's help.Whatever you kindly help us raise won't cover the cost of the camp in its entirety, but that's not a problem! Within the Y-TOP everyone are engaging in fundraising locally within our native countries, in order to promote our values for what money can do, as well as to increase our teamwork skills and to better understand how finance gives us greater access to options we believe in. In the likely case we will reach and exceed our goal we have so many important projects to further, just waiting for us (and now You!) to grow them and give them life. For instance; The Y-TOPtionary (an evolving dictionary for designing new words of the future), formal and informal educational programs (both stationary and nomads), a  Y-TOP music album (enabling us to share our message through original music) and many other movies, writings, arts, workshops, as well as social, artistic and innovation initiatives to build.The PerksFirst, please know that we are truly grateful and full of appreciation for your help.

<div>Boy I sure didn't when I was in grade school, or high school... or college! I don't know what came first... that I stunk at math or that I hated it, but you could definitely say... <i><b>it was one club I wasn't getting into!</b></i><br/><br/>And this definitely hurt me in college and in life. I look back at all the opportunities that passed me by -- <i>especially in areas of life that I love to be involved with now!</i><br/><br/>In my 30's, I always used to say, ""If I had just tried harder, or had a better teacher... I would be so much better off now.""<br/><br/><h4>Well, <b>I don't want to hear any teenager or college student ever say that if I can help it. So I'm starting my own KEVolution in math education...</b>
</h4>
<h4 style=""text-align: center;""><br/></h4>
<h4 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Quick Summary for Smart But Busy People</b></h4>
<div>
<p><b>What:</b> Math Is Alive! The Book is ""50 Mind-Blowing Ways to Make Math Friendly, Fun &amp; Powerful."" It's story-based, curiosity-driven math learning for teens and
their teachers. And this first book is just the start. After it's published and in your hands, I plan to build a platform of interactive education around
these first 50 stories -- and then the next 250 stories! Also, I need your help to <b>GIVE AWAY
100,000 copies</b> of the E-book to families, schools, and communities in need around the world. That's why I'm raising $50,000 to create an excellent book, a durable platform, and an enduring brand.</p>
<p><b>Who:</b> Written by Kevin Cook (that’s me), a technology investor
who was tortured by algebra as a kid and had to teach himself probability &amp; statistics in his 30s. <b>Ever since I ""solved"" the probability puzzle of Pascal and Fermat from the 1650s on my own,</b> I've wanted to write a math book for teens. And when I saw
the comedy film project Supertroopers 2 raise over $4 million here on IndieGoGo, I
knew this was the way to get Math Is Alive! published and into the hands of
potentially millions of kids by going directly to passionate math and kid-lovers like you and getting
your awesome support and involvement for my Big Idea.</p>
<p><b>Why:</b> I recently re-discovered that being totally immersed in science and
math education was my calling, my MVP (Mission-Vision-Purpose). <i>I know that my story-based
learning approach will help so many kids because it not only worked for me, it's what neuroscientists are discovering about the brain every day.</i> The knowledge we've gained this century alone about the 3-pound universe in our skulls should be revolutionizing the way we help kids -- and adults -- learn math and science! Scroll down to the <i><b>""Who's the book for?""</b></i> section to see a bunch of the chapter titles of the 1st edition of Math Is Alive!<br/></p>
<p><b>When:</b> With your help, I’ll get Math Is Alive! published this autumn
and we’ll launch a ""KEVolution in EDUcation"" based on brain science and the principles of Learning Organizations that cultivate positive transformations for
individuals and teams. I don't know how long it will take me to give away 100,000 books to families and schools in need, but I do know that we will start creating the foundation to do so right away. Grab your spot in the limelight with me by locking in a chance to <b>Make Cool Math Videos With Me for only $29!</b><br/></p>
<b>How:</b> My consulting practice Cavernous Educational
Innovations will become a business platform for experiential learning that supports the
Math Is Alive! Mission-Vision-Purpose and creates invaluable transformative opportunities for kids
and adults around the world. It's where I take everything I know about neuroscience, probability, and human behavior and roll them into dynamic presentations that unleash insight and inspiration (see my one-of-a-kind <b>Probability 101</b>, <b>Brain Science Power Hack</b>, and <b>KEVTalk </b>perks). Until my new website is ready, there’s a lot of story
and background on Cavernous below.<b><br/><br/>For You:</b> I created a lot of really special perks to not only say ""Thank You!"" for your support, but to get you involved on lots of different levels. Please take a look at all my great perks and see which ones speak to you. My <b>KEVTalk topics are fantastic opportunities to hear me speak to your group on unique, intelligent and exciting passions of mine</b> that will open up your mind and inspire your people. The price tag is really a steal too, if I do say so myself-- <i>especially since those are the all-in prices for your group, whether you have 5 people or 500!</i><br/><br/>Plus, there's a <b>Secret Perk</b> for only $13 linked somewhere below... see if you can find it! </div>

</div>
</div>
<h2>
<b>The Shocking Truth About Math Education: We are failing kids, and the future</b>
</h2>
<div>Did you know that <b>only 26%</b> of high school seniors are considered proficient in basic math skills when they graduate?</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">And for minority groups, the numbers are even worse: only 12% of Hispanic and just 7% of Black students tested proficient or better.</b><br/>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">These shocking stats aren't from a study done 20 years ago before computers, the Internet, and high-tech teaching tools were available in modern classrooms. This is from the </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">2013 National Assessment of Educational Progress</b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">. And the 2015 data showed things got worse! The problem that has been with us for many decades is still here.<br/><br/></span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469217199/NAEP-Math_sebuda.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/></span></div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<h2><b>What is that problem? It's actually a 2-part obstacle...</b></h2>
<div>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">Obstacle #1:</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> First, </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">the human brain is NOT naturally inclined to love equations</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> and converse with mathematical relationships, like the language we learned to speak at 2 years old.</span><br/>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>
<b style=""background-color: initial;"">Obstacle #2:</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> Second, curriculum methods and </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">text books have NOT been addressing the first obstacle with enough creativity</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> and recognition of personal learning styles. Instead, our ways of teaching math force-feed the </span><i style=""background-color: initial;"">same</i><span style=""background-color: initial;""> facts and ""practice"" problems to </span><i style=""background-color: initial;"">different</i><span style=""background-color: initial;""> kids and then continuously ""test"" them to see if anything stuck.</span><br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>The result is millions of kids from 8 to 18 who are confused and feel like failures. <b>They blame themselves</b> for not getting it, not liking it, and never wanting to do any math again! And just imagine how many of these kids don't feel fit for college. It's the same old story where we are still leaving too many kids singing that old refrain about math...<br/><br/><b><i>""What do I need to know this for? When -- and how -- will I ever use this?""</i></b><br/>
</div>
<br/>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">It's not that we don't have good and committed teachers. </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">There are thousands of qualified and caring math teachers out there. But their hands are tied</b><span style=""background-color: initial;""> by an educational system which treats all kids the same and offers little in the way of vital resources, tools, and time to help the 74% of kids who don't ""naturally"" get math.</span><br/>
</div>
<div><b><br/></b></div>
<h2><b>Our Choice is As Simple as A or B</b></h2>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>A)</b> As a powerful, example-setting nation on the global stage, we can continue to sit back and </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">ignore how individual brains learn</b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">, believing that math proficiency is about ""survival of the fittest."" If we do that, more and more kids will miss opportunities in a global, high-tech jobs market.</span><br/>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">I was lucky enough to make it through a confusing and competitive jobs market because I stumbled upon what worked for me in learning math at 35 years old (my crazy story is coming up). </span><b style=""background-color: initial;"">Most kids won't be so lucky</b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">.

<h2>Math is Alive! The Book</h2>
<h3><b><i>""50 Mind-Blowing Ways to Make Math Friendly, Fun &amp; Powerful!""</i></b></h3>
<p><br/>Story-based, curiosity-driven education worked for me and it has also been proven in the 5 decades of work by <b>Dr.
 Roger Schank, an artificial intelligence theorist, cognitive 
psychologist, learning scientist, educational reformer, and 
entrepreneur.</b> His personal evolution as a researcher, professor, and
 then education reformer is a fascinating story in itself of discovery 
and commitment on the frontiers of what we know about intelligence and 
how minds learn.<br/><br/>I'll let these quotes from him sum up his philosophy...<br/></p>
<h4><b>""Learning
 occurs when someone wants to learn, not when someone wants to teach. I 
was a professor most of my life. In 2000, after 32 years (at Stanford, 
Yale and Northwestern), I decided to quit.""</b></h4>
<p>Schank has spent 
the last 16 years creating revolutionary forms of education for kids, 
universities, and corporations, all based on meaningful stories, 
experiences and <i>learning by doing</i>. <br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<b>
<h4><span>In <i><b>Math Is Alive!</b></i>
 I designed each of the 50 sections to have a unique story and 
action-task that connects a real math concept to every-day life, or to 
something utterly fascinating.</span></h4></b><p><br/></p>
<h1 style=""text-align: center;""><i>""Who's the book for?""</i></h1>

<p>It's for teens, their teachers, and anyone else between the ages of 20 and 120 who is CURIOUS about the numerical formulas and connections amidst everything they encounter every day.</p>

<br/>
<p><b>You probably noticed I have more than a few chapters on the Lottery, Powerball, and the mathematics of games of chance. </b>That's for two reasons:</p>
<p>First, learning this probability math can be fun and simple. And once kids see how simple and fun, it instantly boosts their confidence and their curiosity to learn more involved math! That's how I went from simple dice math to understanding options volatility, statistics, and the order &amp; randomness of complex systems.</p>
<p>Second, I have a burning desire to show as many kids as possible the mechanics of these fruitless games that most states do little to help their citizens benefit from. <b>The odds are horrible and the ""benefits"" mostly go to the corporations that run the games</b>, instead of <i>increasing</i> any general education funds in several near-bankrupt states (they only make up the short-fall from elsewhere).</p>
<p><b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Bottom Line: </span></b><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I want to teach teens that their odds are massively tilted in their favor with the 3 E's of Excellence... Education, Effort and Entrepreneurship. In essence, I want them to hear me say loud and clear... </span></p>

them to follow the steps. It happens when you light a fire of curiosity,
 and at that early stage of crackling ""brain fire"" kindling, it doesn't matter what 
order they go in.<br/><br/>Their interest and passion will drive them to solve a 
mystery they are intensely curious about, like me when I wanted to understand how the Renaissance gambler Antoine Gombaud -- aka, the Chevalier de Mere -- figured out that some of his dice games had an odd pattern that surprised him. <br/>
<br/>
Curiosity-driven was how I got pulled into loving all kinds of math. And it's how I made a life for myself...<br/><br/>Because diving into different math made lots of cool, real life stuff happen for me, like creating a new career in my 30s, buying my first house with an option contract, getting me promotions and new jobs -- like becoming an institutional currency trader handling $100 million in transactions per day! -- and even making me money in the endlessly fascinating stock market.<br/><br/>I say that learning math didn't just make me successful, it made me happier and <i>never bored</i> with so many mysteries to engage my mind from human evolution and the origins of our intelligence and behavior to big questions about religion, liberty, justice, poverty, wealth, and life's purpose.<br/><br/></span>

<span style=""background-color: initial;""><p>As you can see, <b>I actually make my living from math now</b>. I'm no ""quant"" by any stretch but I am crazy about learning different ""maths""<i> because of what I discovered I can do with them.</i>
 My first loves are actually science and psychology, and if I had the 
chance to go back to college, I would study biology, evolution, and 
neuroscience -- and surround myself with really good tutors for the math
 requirements.</p>

<br/>And I just read the most incredible book <b><i>Bold</i>: <i>How to Go BIG, Create WEALTH, and IMPACT the World</i> by Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler.</b> It's about how all these ""Exponential Technologies,"" as they call them, are changing the world so fast that over 50% of global jobs will be completely transformed or eliminated in the next decade. <b>This is why we need to ""turn teens on"" to their individual math power!</b></span>

<span style=""background-color: initial;""></span><br/>This was a powerful book for me because it speaks directly to an epiphany I had when I was in my mid-20s and reading too much Karl Marx and Jeremy Rifkin, thinking that technology and pollution were driving the world to a place where none of us would want to live. <b>In 1992, I woke up from my ""Luddite"" nightmare -- </b>by reading a couple hundred more books about science, innovation, and the naturally creative and ingenuous human brain<b> -- and I created a ""school"" called CAVERNOUS Educational Innovations.</b><br/><br/><span>My core focus was on developing a Socratic seminar for college students titled <b>""Boom or Doom: Exploring the Utopian Collision Course""</b> where we reviewed dozens of books on both sides of the Technology vs. Environment debate. <b>Probably
 no one was using the word ""disruption"" in 1992, but it was precisely

<br/><p><b>But, if you still want to know more about the MVP (Mission-Vision-Purpose) behind this unique and powerful education initiative, there's plenty of background below.</b></p>
<p><b>Enjoy the story!</b></p>
<p>I conceived of Math Is Alive! in 2014 and I found <b><i>Bold</i></b>  this year right when I needed it to convince me that now was the time to complete and launch my own rocket for math and science learning.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, I found the <i><b>Bold</b></i>  book ""accidentally"" when I was seeking inspiration and I did a Google search for ""bold"" missions, visions, and purpose!</p>
<p><i><b>How Serendipitous is That?</b></i></p>
<p>Diamandis actually used crowdfunding to put the <b>Arkyd Telescope</b> in space orbit for schools, scientists, and entrepreneurs around the world to have access to the galaxy!</p></span>
</div>
<h3><b><br/></b></h3>
<h3><b>So how did I go from math flunky to aspiring math wizard? It's a great story and it's also the inspiration for this project...</b></h3>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">When I decided to teach myself essential math skills in my mid-30's, I discovered a <b>great antidote to staring at equations</b> that used to make my eyes glaze over -- <i>if not go into allergic convulsions</i>.<br/><br/><b>I found out that I loved the <i>true life stories</i> of math and science discovery, from Pythagoras to Pascal, and the genius of Galileo, Darwin, and Einstein.</b><br/><br/>I became entranced by the history, philosophy, and mystery-solving abilities of ground-breaking math and science -- and its creators -- much like people who are fascinated by the story of Steve Jobs and how he created Apple.<br/><br/></span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I realized that I was able to learn and even love math once I had a story I could sink my language-driven brain into! I needed the context and meaning for how someone changed history, or maybe just their own life, with a simple formula. <br/><br/></span></div>
<div>
<span style=""background-color: initial;"">And then I was even fortunate to meet some of those people, <b>like stock market options ""wizard"" Blair Hull, the card-counting blackjack player whose winnings paid his way through college in the 1970s</b>, before the MIT teams profiled in the film ""21"" starring Kevin Spacey.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469301954/21_beuzpa.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>And after learning all I could about key subjects like probability and statistics -- <i><b>and seeing the massive drought of such knowledge among people even in my chosen profession of finance</b></i> -- I decided to write a book of fresh stories to help teenagers learn to love math and science the way I did.</span>

<br/><br/></span><h3><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b>CAVERNOUS... designed to deliver Transformative Learning for Organizations &amp; Individuals.</b> </span></h3>
<h3><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></h3>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/><i>Why CAVERNOUS? The name is based on three elements:</i><br/><br/><b>(1) C-A-V-E is the acronym Commitment-Action-Vision-Excellence</b> that I designed in 1992 to symbolize the new values I wanted to pursue in the chaotic, crisis-filled world as it is, not some utopian Neverland of ideals and theories.  <br/><br/><b>(2) Plato's Allegory of the Cave was always powerful symbolism</b> for me of the veil between illusion and truth, the gap between unconscious cultural custom and conscious knowledge quests. To me, wisdom is job #1.<br/><br/><b>(3) Knowledge quests are often like a series of unexplored caves</b> where the learner is driven by curiosity but inevitably gets confused, disoriented, and lost. The only way out of a labyrinth is to go through the mysteries, solve them, and discover vital truth you didn't even anticipate.<br/><br/>While I have been teaching my Probability 101 trading courses for over a decade, now I want to introduce my experiential seminars in organizational psychology and performance under the transformative learning process I call <b>Deep Team Culture</b>.<br/><br/></span><h3><span style=""background-color: initial;""><b><i>What is the common thread between math education, trading, and organizational teams?</i></b></span></h3>
<h3><span style=""background-color: initial;""></span></h3>
<span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/>In a word, <b><i>neuroscience</i></b>. In 3 or 4 words, <i><b>probability-based scenario thinking.</b></i><br/><br/>Our knowledge of the human brain and how we learn and perform, especially under conditions of uncertainty, risk, and individual or group behavioral challenges, is the key to transformative learning. Once I dove into the literature on the brain from great teachers like <b>Joseph LeDoux, Antonio Damasio, Candace Pert, Richard Restak, and Daniel Amen</b> I started to make all kinds of connections to explain our beautiful, powerful, complex, and sometimes irrational, behavior -- <i><b>especially as it affected our Learning, Creativity, and Growth (LCG).</b></i><br/><br/>While we tend to think of ourselves as having ""one mind,"" our brains are actually much more complex, with several often-competing forces and drivers. <b>Candace Pert, who discovered the brain's opiate receptor in 1973, taught us that our brains are swimming with over 100 hormones that regulate emotions, perception, and behavior.</b> When you combine this neuro-chemistry with layers of structures and functions built up over tens of millions of years of evolution, you can easily see that what we really have is a ""multi-mind.""<br/><br/><b>Neuroscientists have learned so much about the science of our behavior in the past 30 years that the frontiers of education should be exploding with new ways of teaching.</b> Yet we are barely scratching the surface.<br/><br/>Maybe Dan Ariely -- a social scientist who studies people ""from the outside"" and catalogs behavioral tendencies that the neuroscientists want to discover the causes of -- is right that no matter how flooded in information and knowledge we are, some irrational thoughts and actions still tend to dominate our behavior...<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469289992/PredictablyIrrational_i7gwy8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>We think we are more consistently rational than we really are. This is the crux of Ariely's work. He learned a lot from the trailblazers in this field, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, as did I when I discovered that smart commodity pit traders at the CME intuitively understood what the neuro and social scientists were just figuring out...<br/><br/><b>Trading and investing</b> are very solitary challenges where the trader's mind is the sole field of engagement with outside forces of uncertainty and risk. I call trading one of the purest, <b>most direct forms of ""applied probability"" because if the trader is unaware of his or her decision-making biases and emotions</b> -- and lets these dominate over sound principles of probability and risk management -- <b>then he or she will experience much frustration and loss of capital.</b> In most cases, help is needed to get through the jungle. And there is an entire social science field built around these ideas called Behavioral Economics, created by researchers like Kahneman and Tversky.<br/><br/><b>Organizational team performance</b> is all about managing common goals by aligning beliefs and values in areas that produce rapid or long-term results: creativity, problem-solving, probability-based project management and <b>the multiplicity of ""idea-into-product"" challenges, from conception and development to production and delivery.</b> I was reading Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Tom Peters, and Peter Senge in these fields 20-some years ago and I haven't stopped finding new thinkers advancing the ways we design and deliver transformative innovation, change-management, and leadership.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469302308/5thDiscipline_r5jtj9.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>But I didn't learn everything I know about these exciting areas from books. <b>I actually worked for a Fortune 500 financial behemoth for 14 years, in four different roles, through sweeping technological and industry change.</b> I experienced first-hand how change-management and innovation were either successfully, or miserably, communicated to staff and thereby executed through staff.</span>
</div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;""><br/></span></div>
<div><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Then I've spent the last 8 years at two dynamic financial institutions each brimming with projects and challenges, both technological and human. But sometimes I look back and think <b>""Everything I know about teamwork and leadership I learned from football.""</b> I had some great coaches who understood how to build kids and teams to bring out their best.</span></div>

</div>
<div>After dropping out of college because I was ""too cool for school,"" I mostly found work where math skills weren't an issue. <b>I was a bartender, a roofer, a waiter, and I even tried to start my own coffee shop</b>... which turned out to be a disaster because -- you guessed it -- I couldn't manage money or set goals to save my life.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>I was a romantic adventurer in my early 20's, charting my own course of meaning and thinking that what I believed in and stood for was <b>more important than the money in my bank account</b>. I discovered a bigger world of beliefs and meaning, than I had previously imagined existed, on the shelves of libraries and book stores.<br/><br/>And I was worried about the poor quality of ""TV entertainment"" and how addicted kids and adults could become to its shallow forms of learning and culture when there were so many important things to learn and problems to solve. I read a lot of Neil Postman then, who had been studying the destructive effects of TV on education and culture for many years.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469369676/Amusing_xzmrqy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

</div>
<div>As a lightening rod of my new-found social consciousness, one cause I became really obsessed with was ""saving the planet."" <b>Did you see the film <i>Into the Wild</i>?</b> I was a lot like that kid in 1990. I read dozens of books on the greenhouse effect, industrial pollution, poverty, and the wide gaps between the super-rich 1% and the hopelessly poor 80-90%.<br/><br/>My politics and economic philosophy were definitely slanted left thanks to Karl Marx and all his living followers who convinced me we were destroying the earth and humanity. </div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<b>And just like that kid, I went off the deep end thinking I could live in the wild as a bold statement about humanity's one-way destruction path.</b> I packed a bag (mostly with books) and boldly (and naively) ""left civilization,"" hitchhiking to Northern California, hoping to find a commune to join where I could live off the land, and off the grid.<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469368446/IntoTheWild_s1psym.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>I didn't know about Christopher McCandless and his life journeys until the 2007 film by Sean Penn, based on the 1996 book by John Krakauer. And strangely, we made our bold statements only months apart in 1990, I in April and he in May after graduating Emory University.<br/><br/>But Christopher McCandless lived his dream all the way through, tragically. And I, less courageously, lived to tell. One of the things that saved me was a book. Actually several books. I tell some of those stories, through my math education journeys in ecology and economics, in the <i><b>Math is Alive!</b></i> Book.</div>

<div>That book helped me learn ""how to think"" about the world's problems with realistic math that could actually solve problems.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>At the time, reading hundreds of other books on evolution, the brain, and the unstoppable ingenuity of humans, <b>it also dawned on me that we couldn't stop technological progress because it was at the core of being human. </b>To be human meant to be a thinker, doer, tinkerer, creator. We were going to constantly keep inventing new problems and their solutions until the end of time.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>In this self-education process in my mid and late-20's, <b>I fell in love with two different paths in life where ""a bit"" of math was required. One was science.</b>  I was insatiably curious about the origins of the universe, the evolution of life and the human brain, and the ecology of a beautiful planet where pollution and poverty were becoming big problems -- and those areas obviously required being able to appreciate math!<br/><br/>The other path was that I started working in an industry where math is an every-day tool: <i>the stock market</i>.<b> I read about these guys and gals called the ""market wizards"" who were controlling their own destinies as traders in global financial markets and making <i>lots</i> of money doing it.</b><br/><br/>These traders lived for freedom, creative challenge, and wealth and I wanted to be just like them. That meant I had to learn a little bit more math. Because if I wanted to have any good impact on the world, I needed money.<br/><br/><p></p>

<br/>
<b>And to be a successful capitalist,</b> you had to know your way around numbers because there were plenty of people out there who would try to take your money with their better grasp (and manipulation) of numbers.<br/><br/>Here was another important book I read in the early 1990s as I woke up from my gloom about the future. <i><b>New World, New Mind</b></i> was written by <b>Paul Ehrlich, who was rethinking his own doomsaying about over-population, and Robert Ornstein the groundbreaking researcher in the psychology of consciousness.</b><br/><br/>They helped further inspire a science-focused basis for any ideas I had about changing the world, especially with their focus on <b>our multi-million year old savanna brain architecture making decisions in the face of lightning-fast electronic stimulation and a 24/7 streaming barrage of news, tragedy, and political issues</b> from around the globe...<br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1469369021/NewWorldNewMind_dcha8m.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div>
<h3>Learning to Count = Making Your Dreams Count</h3>
<div>The good news is that I became successful in my trading career because I applied my mind to the task and learned the math I needed to. But I didn't do it because anyone told me I had to, or because my mind was focused on wealth (but that helped).<br/><br/>I did so because I found out how fascinating some areas of math were to me.<br/><br/><b>It was like I was solving a mystery every day that actually made me feel smart, accomplished, and going places. And a lot of it was just plain fun.</b><br/><br/>Now I want to <b>help millions of kids all across the globe to find their curiosity and passion for math ideas and tools.</b> I'm not talking about making kids fall in love with numbers and fancy equations.<br/><br/>I'm talking about <b>creating a spark where they didn't know one existed</b> and using that inspiration to be fascinated by life's mysteries, to build a great education and career -- or start their own business -- and basically to achieve any goal they desire.<br/><br/><h3><b>Math can be a tool, an adventure, or a bridge.

Boy I sure didn't when I was in grade school, or high school... or college! I don't know what came first... that I stunk at math or that I hated it, but you could definitely say... it was one club I wasn't getting into!And this definitely hurt me in college and in life. I look back at all the opportunities that passed me by -- especially in areas of life that I love to be involved with now!In my 30's, I always used to say, ""If I had just tried harder, or had a better teacher... I would be so much better off now.""Well, I don't want to hear any teenager or college student ever say that if I can help it. So I'm starting my own KEVolution in math education...


Quick Summary for Smart But Busy People

What: Math Is Alive! The Book is ""50 Mind-Blowing Ways to Make Math Friendly, Fun & Powerful."" It's story-based, curiosity-driven math learning for teens and
their teachers. And this first book is just the start. After it's published and in your hands, I plan to build a platform of interactive education around
these first 50 stories -- and then the next 250 stories! Also, I need your help to GIVE AWAY
100,000 copies of the E-book to families, schools, and communities in need around the world. That's why I'm raising $50,000 to create an excellent book, a durable platform, and an enduring brand.
Who: Written by Kevin Cook (that’s me), a technology investor
who was tortured by algebra as a kid and had to teach himself probability & statistics in his 30s. Ever since I ""solved"" the probability puzzle of Pascal and Fermat from the 1650s on my own, I've wanted to write a math book for teens. And when I saw
the comedy film project Supertroopers 2 raise over $4 million here on IndieGoGo, I
knew this was the way to get Math Is Alive! published and into the hands of
potentially millions of kids by going directly to passionate math and kid-lovers like you and getting
your awesome support and involvement for my Big Idea.
Why: I recently re-discovered that being totally immersed in science and
math education was my calling, my MVP (Mission-Vision-Purpose). I know that my story-based
learning approach will help so many kids because it not only worked for me, it's what neuroscientists are discovering about the brain every day. The knowledge we've gained this century alone about the 3-pound universe in our skulls should be revolutionizing the way we help kids -- and adults -- learn math and science! Scroll down to the ""Who's the book for?"" section to see a bunch of the chapter titles of the 1st edition of Math Is Alive!
When: With your help, I’ll get Math Is Alive! published this autumn
and we’ll launch a ""KEVolution in EDUcation"" based on brain science and the principles of Learning Organizations that cultivate positive transformations for
individuals and teams. I don't know how long it will take me to give away 100,000 books to families and schools in need, but I do know that we will start creating the foundation to do so right away. Grab your spot in the limelight with me by locking in a chance to Make Cool Math Videos With Me for only $29!
How: My consulting practice Cavernous Educational
Innovations will become a business platform for experiential learning that supports the
Math Is Alive! Mission-Vision-Purpose and creates invaluable transformative opportunities for kids
and adults around the world. It's where I take everything I know about neuroscience, probability, and human behavior and roll them into dynamic presentations that unleash insight and inspiration (see my one-of-a-kind Probability 101, Brain Science Power Hack, and KEVTalk perks). Until my new website is ready, there’s a lot of story
and background on Cavernous below.For You: I created a lot of really special perks to not only say ""Thank You!"" for your support, but to get you involved on lots of different levels. Please take a look at all my great perks and see which ones speak to you. My KEVTalk topics are fantastic opportunities to hear me speak to your group on unique, intelligent and exciting passions of mine that will open up your mind and inspire your people. The price tag is really a steal too, if I do say so myself-- especially since those are the all-in prices for your group, whether you have 5 people or 500!Plus, there's a Secret Perk for only $13 linked somewhere below... see if you can find it! 



The Full Story... For Insatiably Curious People



The Shocking Truth About Math Education: We are failing kids, and the future

Did you know that only 26% of high school seniors are considered proficient in basic math skills when they graduate?


And for minority groups, the numbers are even worse: only 12% of Hispanic and just 7% of Black students tested proficient or better.



These shocking stats aren't from a study done 20 years ago before computers, the Internet, and high-tech teaching tools were available in modern classrooms. This is from the 2013 National Assessment of Educational Progress. And the 2015 data showed things got worse! The problem that has been with us for many decades is still here.




What is that problem? It's actually a 2-part obstacle...

Obstacle #1: First, the human brain is NOT naturally inclined to love equations and converse with mathematical relationships, like the language we learned to speak at 2 years old.



Obstacle #2: Second, curriculum methods and text books have NOT been addressing the first obstacle with enough creativity and recognition of personal learning styles. Instead, our ways of teaching math force-feed the same facts and ""practice"" problems to different kids and then continuously ""test"" them to see if anything stuck.


The result is millions of kids from 8 to 18 who are confused and feel like failures. They blame themselves for not getting it, not liking it, and never wanting to do any math again! And just imagine how many of these kids don't feel fit for college. It's the same old story where we are still leaving too many kids singing that old refrain about math...""What do I need to know this for? When -- and how -- will I ever use this?""



It's not that we don't have good and committed teachers. There are thousands of qualified and caring math teachers out there. But their hands are tied by an educational system which treats all kids the same and offers little in the way of vital resources, tools, and time to help the 74% of kids who don't ""naturally"" get math.


Our Choice is As Simple as A or B

A) As a powerful, example-setting nation on the global stage, we can continue to sit back and ignore how individual brains learn, believing that math proficiency is about ""survival of the fittest."" If we do that, more and more kids will miss opportunities in a global, high-tech jobs market.



I was lucky enough to make it through a confusing and competitive jobs market because I stumbled upon what worked for me in learning math at 35 years old (my crazy story is coming up). Most kids won't be so lucky. It will be too late for them.



OR...









Because I choose Solution B, I'm launching a new education mission...








Math Is Alive! The Book, The School, The Revolution



Math is Alive! The Book
""50 Mind-Blowing Ways to Make Math Friendly, Fun & Powerful!""
Story-based, curiosity-driven education worked for me and it has also been proven in the 5 decades of work by Dr.
 Roger Schank, an artificial intelligence theorist, cognitive 
psychologist, learning scientist, educational reformer, and 
entrepreneur. His personal evolution as a researcher, professor, and
 then education reformer is a fascinating story in itself of discovery 
and commitment on the frontiers of what we know about intelligence and 
how minds learn.I'll let these quotes from him sum up his philosophy...
""Learning
 occurs when someone wants to learn, not when someone wants to teach. I 
was a professor most of my life. In 2000, after 32 years (at Stanford, 
Yale and Northwestern), I decided to quit.""
Schank has spent 
the last 16 years creating revolutionary forms of education for kids, 
universities, and corporations, all based on meaningful stories, 
experiences and learning by doing. 


In Math Is Alive!
 I designed each of the 50 sections to have a unique story and 
action-task that connects a real math concept to every-day life, or to 
something utterly fascinating.
""Who's the book for?""

It's for teens, their teachers, and anyone else between the ages of 20 and 120 who is CURIOUS about the numerical formulas and connections amidst everything they encounter every day.

Here are 25 of the chapter titles, weaving together stories, games, puzzles, and thought experiments that will blow your beautiful, mathematical mind!

You probably noticed I have more than a few chapters on the Lottery, Powerball, and the mathematics of games of chance. That's for two reasons:
First, learning this probability math can be fun and simple. And once kids see how simple and fun, it instantly boosts their confidence and their curiosity to learn more involved math! That's how I went from simple dice math to understanding options volatility, statistics, and the order & randomness of complex systems.
Second, I have a burning desire to show as many kids as possible the mechanics of these fruitless games that most states do little to help their citizens benefit from. The odds are horrible and the ""benefits"" mostly go to the corporations that run the games, instead of increasing any general education funds in several near-bankrupt states (they only make up the short-fall from elsewhere).
Bottom Line: I want to teach teens that their odds are massively tilted in their favor with the 3 E's of Excellence... Education, Effort and Entrepreneurship. In essence, I want them to hear me say loud and clear... 

Bet On Yourself!



Now check out this 4-minute version of my intro video to learn more details about the MVP (Mission-Vision-Purpose) of the Math Is Alive! KEVolution...



It's Time for Bold Action


As you can see, I'm not ""teaching"" math as much as exploring it, celebrating it, and gossiping about it! I don't build a knowledge base, going step-by-step. I build a bonfire of fascination and curiosity. Because math learning for most kids won't happen just because we ask 
them to follow the steps. It happens when you light a fire of curiosity,
 and at that early stage of crackling ""brain fire"" kindling, it doesn't matter what 
order they go in.Their interest and passion will drive them to solve a 
mystery they are intensely curious about, like me when I wanted to understand how the Renaissance gambler Antoine Gombaud -- aka, the Chevalier de Mere -- figured out that some of his dice games had an odd pattern that surprised him. 

Curiosity-driven was how I got pulled into loving all kinds of math. And it's how I made a life for myself...Because diving into different math made lots of cool, real life stuff happen for me, like creating a new career in my 30s, buying my first house with an option contract, getting me promotions and new jobs -- like becoming an institutional currency trader handling $100 million in transactions per day! -- and even making me money in the endlessly fascinating stock market.I say that learning math didn't just make me successful, it made me happier and never bored with so many mysteries to engage my mind from human evolution and the origins of our intelligence and behavior to big questions about religion, liberty, justice, poverty, wealth, and life's purpose.

As you can see, I actually make my living from math now. I'm no ""quant"" by any stretch but I am crazy about learning different ""maths"" because of what I discovered I can do with them.
 My first loves are actually science and psychology, and if I had the 
chance to go back to college, I would study biology, evolution, and 
neuroscience -- and surround myself with really good tutors for the math
 requirements.

But now I play 
with financial numbers and formulas all day to help other people make 
money. And the math I learn there bleeds over into all kinds of other 
areas I love in science, psychology, sociology, and technology!

What's my profession? I am a stock market strategist and portfolio manager. Every day I research companies and advise investors on which stocks to buy and which to sell.
My favorite areas of 
interest involve the companies creating the future in Technology, 
Software, Biotechnology, Big Data Visualization, Cognitive Analytics, 
Artificial Intelligence, 3-D Printing, Autonomous Cars, and the Internet
 of Things.
And I just read the most incredible book Bold: How to Go BIG, Create WEALTH, and IMPACT the World by Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler. It's about how all these ""Exponential Technologies,"" as they call them, are changing the world so fast that over 50% of global jobs will be completely transformed or eliminated in the next decade. This is why we need to ""turn teens on"" to their individual math power!




Peter Diamandis, often called ""the first space entrepreneur,"" is the creator of the X PRIZE for space exploration and a founding member of the International Space University and Singularity University. And he's friends with brilliant billionaires like Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Richard Branson of Virgin, Larry Page of Google, and Elon Musk of Tesla -- all who have their own space enterprises, as you likely know. In Bold, these visionary ""disruptors"" and exponential thinkers share what drives them to change the world.
Steven Kotler, a thought leader in human potential and ultimate performance, is cofounder/director of research for the Flow Genome Project. His previous work, The Rise of Superman, draws on over 15 years of research, including first-hand reporting with dozens of top action and adventure athletes like epic surfer Laird Hamilton, extreme snowboarder Travis Rice, motocross nut Travis Pastrana, and rock climbing phenom Dean Potter. In it, Steven decodes the science of flow, an optimal state of consciousness where we feel our best and perform our best. 




In their first book together, Abundance, Diamandis and Kotler document how progress in artificial intelligence, robotics, infinite computing, ubiquitous broadband networks, digital manufacturing, nanomaterials, synthetic biology, and many other exponentially growing technologies will enable us to make greater gains in the next two decades than we have in the previous two hundred years.This was their manifesto to counter ideas about limited resources and the persistence of poverty. Diamandis and Kotler reasoned that we will soon have the ability to meet and exceed the basic needs of every man, woman, and child on the planet. And they asserted that abundance for all is within our grasp.

This was a powerful book for me because it speaks directly to an epiphany I had when I was in my mid-20s and reading too much Karl Marx and Jeremy Rifkin, thinking that technology and pollution were driving the world to a place where none of us would want to live. In 1992, I woke up from my ""Luddite"" nightmare -- by reading a couple hundred more books about science, innovation, and the naturally creative and ingenuous human brain -- and I created a ""school"" called CAVERNOUS Educational Innovations.My core focus was on developing a Socratic seminar for college students titled ""Boom or Doom: Exploring the Utopian Collision Course"" where we reviewed dozens of books on both sides of the Technology vs. Environment debate. Probably
 no one was using the word ""disruption"" in 1992, but it was precisely 
the driving theme of human innovation and chaos I knew I had to accept 
and adapt to. So I put down the Rifkin books and started learning 
more science and math that gave me knowledge and inspiration, not just 
ideology and hopelessness.



More on my ""1992 brain transplant"" coming up... because my dream of 25 years ago is finally getting its chance to come alive and help teens and college kids around the world. But suffice to say right now, 25 years later we still have serious global problems to address with poverty and pollution.And the way out is not to take a hard stance on something like ""global warming"" and climate change but to make sure more citizens know the math and science of it so they can evaluate complex data trends. 25 years ago, no one ever heard of Elon Musk and his visionary mission to create sustainable energy for the world with Tesla. His brand of entrepreneurship, along with Bezos, Branson, and Page, will change the world faster with innovative ideas than all the pessimists combined.
My mission is to inspire more kids to want to become scientists, engineers, designers -- and other types of world changers like artists, teachers, filmmakers, and musicians -- to work on these problems!

Ready to Join My Revolution?

If you already ""get"" Math Is Alive! and want to be a part of the Revolution, grab a perk or three and let's go!



But, if you still want to know more about the MVP (Mission-Vision-Purpose) behind this unique and powerful education initiative, there's plenty of background below.
Enjoy the story!
I conceived of Math Is Alive! in 2014 and I found Bold  this year right when I needed it to convince me that now was the time to complete and launch my own rocket for math and science learning.
Believe it or not, I found the Bold  book ""accidentally"" when I was seeking inspiration and I did a Google search for ""bold"" missions, visions, and purpose!
How Serendipitous is That?
Diamandis actually used crowdfunding to put the Arkyd Telescope in space orbit for schools, scientists, and entrepreneurs around the world to have access to the galaxy!


So how did I go from math flunky to aspiring math wizard? It's a great story and it's also the inspiration for this project...


When I decided to teach myself essential math skills in my mid-30's, I discovered a great antidote to staring at equations that used to make my eyes glaze over -- if not go into allergic convulsions.I found out that I loved the true life stories of math and science discovery, from Pythagoras to Pascal, and the genius of Galileo, Darwin, and Einstein.I became entranced by the history, philosophy, and mystery-solving abilities of ground-breaking math and science -- and its creators -- much like people who are fascinated by the story of Steve Jobs and how he created Apple.

I realized that I was able to learn and even love math once I had a story I could sink my language-driven brain into! I needed the context and meaning for how someone changed history, or maybe just their own life, with a simple formula. 

And then I was even fortunate to meet some of those people, like stock market options ""wizard"" Blair Hull, the card-counting blackjack player whose winnings paid his way through college in the 1970s, before the MIT teams profiled in the film ""21"" starring Kevin Spacey.
And after learning all I could about key subjects like probability and statistics -- and seeing the massive drought of such knowledge among people even in my chosen profession of finance -- I decided to write a book of fresh stories to help teenagers learn to love math and science the way I did.


A Launch Platform for Revolutionary Math Education!

If you haven't already, take a look at the great perks I'm offering to invite YOU to become an awesome part of the Math Is Alive! Revolution and help thousands, and possibly millions, of kids discover what math could do for them.This project will be a new dawn in the math and science education of kids around the globe because this first book will be the LAUNCH PLATFORM for The Revolution where I will invite creative teachers, designers, and developers from dozens of countries and cultures to build interactive education, learning tools and apps around each story!And one of my intermediate-term goals (1-3 years) after the publication of Math Is Alive! is to GIVE AWAY 100,000 COPIES to SCHOOLS & FAMILIES IN NEED AROUND THE GLOBE! I don't know how long that will take because I've never done anything like it. So your help will be so instrumental in getting my book, in whatever form, into the hands of teachers and students in Third World, remote, and impoverished areas. Let's Do This!


That's It!

That's the MVP (Mission-Vision-Purpose) of Math Is Alive!

I hope you're on board! And I hope you found a way to participate with one, or a few, of my great perks that speaks to you.





If you want to know more about what I'm up to, I've included more below about Cavernous and details of the exciting education projects that are inextricably intertwined with Math Is Alive! You can read about them here until my website is ready.

Oh, and the Secret Perk for only $13 is still hiding below somewhere!

The Math Is Alive! Book has the potential to inspire thousands of kids and their teachers. And to help make sure it achieves its MVP status, I'm launching a consulting and speaking practice that will ""work for math."" In other words...

CAVERNOUS Education
& ""Deep Team Culture""
Will Help Pay the Way!

To complete, publish, market, and distribute Math Is Alive! I will need to raise at least $25,000. And to help ""pay the way"" I will be rolling out several proprietary and experiential education events under the banner of CAVERNOUS Educational Innovations.
CAVERNOUS... designed to deliver Transformative Learning for Organizations & Individuals. 

Why CAVERNOUS? The name is based on three elements:(1) C-A-V-E is the acronym Commitment-Action-Vision-Excellence that I designed in 1992 to symbolize the new values I wanted to pursue in the chaotic, crisis-filled world as it is, not some utopian Neverland of ideals and theories.  (2) Plato's Allegory of the Cave was always powerful symbolism for me of the veil between illusion and truth, the gap between unconscious cultural custom and conscious knowledge quests. To me, wisdom is job #1.(3) Knowledge quests are often like a series of unexplored caves where the learner is driven by curiosity but inevitably gets confused, disoriented, and lost. The only way out of a labyrinth is to go through the mysteries, solve them, and discover vital truth you didn't even anticipate.While I have been teaching my Probability 101 trading courses for over a decade, now I want to introduce my experiential seminars in organizational psychology and performance under the transformative learning process I call Deep Team Culture.What is the common thread between math education, trading, and organizational teams?

In a word, neuroscience. In 3 or 4 words, probability-based scenario thinking.Our knowledge of the human brain and how we learn and perform, especially under conditions of uncertainty, risk, and individual or group behavioral challenges, is the key to transformative learning. Once I dove into the literature on the brain from great teachers like Joseph LeDoux, Antonio Damasio, Candace Pert, Richard Restak, and Daniel Amen I started to make all kinds of connections to explain our beautiful, powerful, complex, and sometimes irrational, behavior -- especially as it affected our Learning, Creativity, and Growth (LCG).While we tend to think of ourselves as having ""one mind,"" our brains are actually much more complex, with several often-competing forces and drivers. Candace Pert, who discovered the brain's opiate receptor in 1973, taught us that our brains are swimming with over 100 hormones that regulate emotions, perception, and behavior. When you combine this neuro-chemistry with layers of structures and functions built up over tens of millions of years of evolution, you can easily see that what we really have is a ""multi-mind.""Neuroscientists have learned so much about the science of our behavior in the past 30 years that the frontiers of education should be exploding with new ways of teaching. Yet we are barely scratching the surface.Maybe Dan Ariely -- a social scientist who studies people ""from the outside"" and catalogs behavioral tendencies that the neuroscientists want to discover the causes of -- is right that no matter how flooded in information and knowledge we are, some irrational thoughts and actions still tend to dominate our behavior...
We think we are more consistently rational than we really are. This is the crux of Ariely's work. He learned a lot from the trailblazers in this field, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, as did I when I discovered that smart commodity pit traders at the CME intuitively understood what the neuro and social scientists were just figuring out...Trading and investing are very solitary challenges where the trader's mind is the sole field of engagement with outside forces of uncertainty and risk. I call trading one of the purest, most direct forms of ""applied probability"" because if the trader is unaware of his or her decision-making biases and emotions -- and lets these dominate over sound principles of probability and risk management -- then he or she will experience much frustration and loss of capital. In most cases, help is needed to get through the jungle. And there is an entire social science field built around these ideas called Behavioral Economics, created by researchers like Kahneman and Tversky.Organizational team performance is all about managing common goals by aligning beliefs and values in areas that produce rapid or long-term results: creativity, problem-solving, probability-based project management and the multiplicity of ""idea-into-product"" challenges, from conception and development to production and delivery. I was reading Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Tom Peters, and Peter Senge in these fields 20-some years ago and I haven't stopped finding new thinkers advancing the ways we design and deliver transformative innovation, change-management, and leadership.
But I didn't learn everything I know about these exciting areas from books. I actually worked for a Fortune 500 financial behemoth for 14 years, in four different roles, through sweeping technological and industry change. I experienced first-hand how change-management and innovation were either successfully, or miserably, communicated to staff and thereby executed through staff.


Then I've spent the last 8 years at two dynamic financial institutions each brimming with projects and challenges, both technological and human. But sometimes I look back and think ""Everything I know about teamwork and leadership I learned from football."" I had some great coaches who understood how to build kids and teams to bring out their best.


Deep Team Culture is not a mandate or rubric. It's a leadership function of knowing your people well, understanding how teams work best, and creating space and time for them to ignite the highest visions for their work, as individuals and as teammates.


The cultural core of powerful learning organizations comes from the leader. He or she is like the wise farmer who obeys the laws of nature and nurture, and continuously builds and feeds good organizational soil that helps people thrive in an on-going cycle of Learn-Create-Grow (LCG).



My Deep Team Culture approach is designed to get to the ""ecological"" core of success and innovation for every unique organizational team, whether they are experienced with agile, sprint, scrum, and other rapid development practices, or just starting out. The mechanics of project and team success are centered around specific first principles and ground rules that create a rich soil for rapid innovation and execution to grow and thrive. If you or your organization are interested in experiencing the Deep Team Culture approach to innovation and agile project execution, the Math Is Alive! crowdfund offers a terrific way for you to get unique access to its ideas and practices.Just check out the perks where you can be among the first to get your hands on a Deep Team Culture publication or participate in a Deep Team Culture training event and support the launch of Math Is Alive! at the same time!
Still not wildly crazy about the Math Is Alive! Revolution? Then read this wild & crazy story of my ""radical"" youth...


From Drop-Out to Fired-Up!I have created lots of simple, fun, and rewarding ways to join The Math Is Alive! Revolution that will bring this project to life and make YOU a part of something really special and world-changing.But, you might still be wondering HOW a former math-flunky is qualified to write a math book and to teach new ways of learning math. THAT'S the key -- my transformation from ""deathly afraid of math"" to ""fired-up to learn, create, and make money with math"" was an explosion of creativity and power for me.

Now, I HAVE TO share that success with as many kids as possible.

Let me share a little more about my story so you can see why my heart and mind are so ""all in"" this mission.

After dropping out of college because I was ""too cool for school,"" I mostly found work where math skills weren't an issue. I was a bartender, a roofer, a waiter, and I even tried to start my own coffee shop... which turned out to be a disaster because -- you guessed it -- I couldn't manage money or set goals to save my life.

I was a romantic adventurer in my early 20's, charting my own course of meaning and thinking that what I believed in and stood for was more important than the money in my bank account. I discovered a bigger world of beliefs and meaning, than I had previously imagined existed, on the shelves of libraries and book stores.And I was worried about the poor quality of ""TV entertainment"" and how addicted kids and adults could become to its shallow forms of learning and culture when there were so many important things to learn and problems to solve. I read a lot of Neil Postman then, who had been studying the destructive effects of TV on education and culture for many years.


As a lightening rod of my new-found social consciousness, one cause I became really obsessed with was ""saving the planet."" Did you see the film Into the Wild? I was a lot like that kid in 1990. I read dozens of books on the greenhouse effect, industrial pollution, poverty, and the wide gaps between the super-rich 1% and the hopelessly poor 80-90%.My politics and economic philosophy were definitely slanted left thanks to Karl Marx and all his living followers who convinced me we were destroying the earth and humanity. 


And just like that kid, I went off the deep end thinking I could live in the wild as a bold statement about humanity's one-way destruction path. I packed a bag (mostly with books) and boldly (and naively) ""left civilization,"" hitchhiking to Northern California, hoping to find a commune to join where I could live off the land, and off the grid.
I didn't know about Christopher McCandless and his life journeys until the 2007 film by Sean Penn, based on the 1996 book by John Krakauer. And strangely, we made our bold statements only months apart in 1990, I in April and he in May after graduating Emory University.But Christopher McCandless lived his dream all the way through, tragically. And I, less courageously, lived to tell. One of the things that saved me was a book. Actually several books. I tell some of those stories, through my math education journeys in ecology and economics, in the Math is Alive! Book.



But I'll share one book right now...


Filters Against Folly by Garrett Hardin. The book's sub-title says it all...
How to Survive Despite Economists, Ecologists, and the Merely Eloquent

That book helped me learn ""how to think"" about the world's problems with realistic math that could actually solve problems.

At the time, reading hundreds of other books on evolution, the brain, and the unstoppable ingenuity of humans, it also dawned on me that we couldn't stop technological progress because it was at the core of being human. To be human meant to be a thinker, doer, tinkerer, creator. We were going to constantly keep inventing new problems and their solutions until the end of time.

In this self-education process in my mid and late-20's, I fell in love with two different paths in life where ""a bit"" of math was required. One was science.  I was insatiably curious about the origins of the universe, the evolution of life and the human brain, and the ecology of a beautiful planet where pollution and poverty were becoming big problems -- and those areas obviously required being able to appreciate math!The other path was that I started working in an industry where math is an every-day tool: the stock market. I read about these guys and gals called the ""market wizards"" who were controlling their own destinies as traders in global financial markets and making lots of money doing it.These traders lived for freedom, creative challenge, and wealth and I wanted to be just like them. That meant I had to learn a little bit more math. Because if I wanted to have any good impact on the world, I needed money.


And to be a successful capitalist, you had to know your way around numbers because there were plenty of people out there who would try to take your money with their better grasp (and manipulation) of numbers.Here was another important book I read in the early 1990s as I woke up from my gloom about the future. New World, New Mind was written by Paul Ehrlich, who was rethinking his own doomsaying about over-population, and Robert Ornstein the groundbreaking researcher in the psychology of consciousness.They helped further inspire a science-focused basis for any ideas I had about changing the world, especially with their focus on our multi-million year old savanna brain architecture making decisions in the face of lightning-fast electronic stimulation and a 24/7 streaming barrage of news, tragedy, and political issues from around the globe...


Learning to Count = Making Your Dreams Count
The good news is that I became successful in my trading career because I applied my mind to the task and learned the math I needed to. But I didn't do it because anyone told me I had to, or because my mind was focused on wealth (but that helped).I did so because I found out how fascinating some areas of math were to me.It was like I was solving a mystery every day that actually made me feel smart, accomplished, and going places. And a lot of it was just plain fun.Now I want to help millions of kids all across the globe to find their curiosity and passion for math ideas and tools. I'm not talking about making kids fall in love with numbers and fancy equations.I'm talking about creating a spark where they didn't know one existed and using that inspiration to be fascinated by life's mysteries, to build a great education and career -- or start their own business -- and basically to achieve any goal they desire.Math can be a tool, an adventure, or a bridge. I want to help kids find out what it could be for them!

Secret Perk: MathChat Hangout!As a psychology and philosophy student in college (and largely self-taught in those areas after I left college), I always wanted to teach and inspire young minds to explore the world and become all they were capable of.In fact, I have been planning and dreaming for the past 25 years of ways I could become a highly-motivational and inspirational teacher for high school students. I've done it for adults in financial markets for 20 years and now it's time to do it for teens everywhere who just need a helping hand and a passionate boost.And I finally found a way to start...


How You Can Help Launch the ""Math Is Alive!"" Revolution in Just 3 Steps!Step #1: Look at the Perks and the multiple ways I designed for you to help launch the Math Is Alive! Revolution. I am raising $50,000 to publish the 1st edition of the ""Math Is Alive!"" Book and to start teaching The School course to thousands of kids.One of my gigantic goals is to give away 100,000 free copies of the 1st edition to families in need. And I will be arranging special discounts for The School to those families as well. As you can tell, this campaign is just the start. Once we're rolling, I will be winning corporate sponsorships for the Math Is Alive! Revolution.Step #2: Pick a Perk that speaks most to you! I want you to feel like a part of the Math Is Alive! Revolution and to know that your contribution will be the spark to make a difference for potentially millions of kids.Step #3: Cheer Me On as I finish writing the book and get ready to launch the Revolution. Shouting out to your social networks and linking to our Facebook page will be wonderfully appreciated because for me to complete phase one of this mission, the $25,000 mark is the minimum needed as I put The Revolution on a firm foundation to create and publish The Book and teach The School course.

What's the money for?
I had a website being built, but the project was derailed (hired wrong person) and I had to launch anyway without one. That money is gone and I know I need a professional website to give the book maximum reach and impact, like getting media interviews and hosting my articles on math education and Deep Team Culture, my consulting work which will help pay the way. Here are my top costs right now...

1) Professional Website and Database Support Functions
2) Book Publication Strategy (design, layout, printing, etc.)
3) Video Production for Dozens of Online Math Lessons
4) PR/Media Campaign and Speaking Tour
5) Marketing and Social Media Campaign
6) Co-Working Space
7) Freelance Assistance/Interns
8) Business and Legal Advice/Services
9) Book Distribution Logistics

The Impact

 I built a successful career in finance without a college degree and I didn't start until I was 29. What I lacked in math skills I made up for in dreams and tenacity and curiosity. I simply love to learn and discover new ideas about our brains and how we learn. Imagine what we can accomplish as I launch this dream to teach kids around the world about their own curiosity and tenacity for math and science... 
Millions of kids discovering their own uses and passion for math and science! More of those kids going to college and succeeding in pursuit of their goals! And some of those kids going on to inspire others as teachers themselves!

<p>       Today, I have Steve Jobs to thank for saving my life!</p>
<p>Many years ago in fact, 2004 I saw an advertisement about an Apple product that would read to me.  Due to my disability, I had years of not comprehending what people say or understanding what I read.  I heard about this product and knew this was what I needed. You see, I had a vision of making futuristic cabinets, and knew that this product would definitely save my life.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""> I became passionate about my project and my Apple Computer. I bought the Talking Apple Computer and personally taught myself on how to use it. I am a perfectionist for wanting to learn every aspect in getting every detail right.  His product being so innovative, it helped me in all the right ways.  I sacrificed in waiting many years for this opportunity in sticking with it come hell or high water, I  am preparing to launch my project in appreciation for Apple's innovative products.</span><br/></p>
<p>Having so much respect for my passion that I am willing to admit that I may have been a little bit fanatical, even over-the-top, but thanks to God and  Mr. Steve Jobs, and to all who I will never forget in making this all possible for me!  With your support I will be ready to launch this project next!</p>
<p></p>I must say my disability has it time of getting in my way but I won't let that get me down. For me, it's been my life in looking for people like you'll in helping me along the way. I am now 57 years old and my birthday is Nov. 3rd.  I started this  venture for my life purpose of being successful to see myself as someone special back in 1978. I do have all of my documents and papers to show I did start then. It is my wish to put all of my documents  on display for all to see here at Universal Production Studio/exhibit. I feel it will inspire others along the way through their journey for success.  So I thank you all for being here for me  in making this possible!  If there is to be success  for me Indiegogo is the key  .<p><br/></p>

Look for the ""URBAN SPECIAL APPARELS"" perks for details.                                                ""SAVE THE BEST FOR LAST!!"" 
First of all, thank you for considering  us! Coming soon Universal Production Studio upcoming curriculum’s to engage students in enhancing their passion for designing, marketing, promoting and advertising.  Universal Production Studio is the Think Tank ""THE BRAIN"" the research, survey projection, designing, marketing, promoting and commercial advertising  and the operations of   the program. Our aim is to foster and support the future of our young adults.  Universal Production Studio will give them a sense of pride in knowing our environment will inspire them and help build positive work behaviors including such things as volunteering for extra work, being courteous, time management skills and to bring them to greater organizational citizenship behaviors. 




A supportive workplace should be more attractive and involving. It is anticipated that workers will be less likely to withdraw when support is high. Previous conceptual and empirical work has demonstrated that the construct of withdrawal is a broad one.





We are developing an exhibit for Universal Production Studio  as of a large-scale museum space installation, center and corporate display.  Our professional historians will research information we need and pull all the elements together to tell an interesting and authoritative story.  The museum’s vibrant exhibits will explore the impact of individuals whose beliefs and values have contributed to the unique legacy of our concept.  This will be combined with our every day professional business operations in conjunction with designing, marketing, promoting and advertising.  
When it comes to our three tier team of  precision innovators working with our students they will astound you through the operations network let's take a look. 


This leads us to immerse into boundless opportunities to the masses! A phenomenal unprecedented achievement for our students.
Whether you are visiting or taking courses in Universal Production studio establishment  you will be able to experience our creative knowledge studio exhibit. Learn how we got our start and where we are going in the future with our design concepts. The creative use of our pictures and videos will capture your vivid imagination and will create a lasting impression.
Become a donor or a volunteer help us build the progression of  this project as it evolves. Take a look at this and I'm sure you will be willing to stay connected to something that drives your passion. You'll see why your  contribution is important  to the development of this fantastic  project.
 


Combined with traditional instruction the use of computers and technology can increase student learning in the traditional curriculum and basic skills area. The integration of computers with traditional instruction produces higher academic achievement in a variety of subject areas than does traditional instruction alone.
Students learn more quickly and with greater retention when learning with the aid of computers and other technology. Students like learning with computers and their attitudes towards learning and school are positively affected by computer use. The use of computers appears most promising for low achieving and at-risk students.  Effective and adequate teacher training is an integral element of     successful learning programs based or assisted by technology.






To build this studio from the ground up we need $350,000.  We recognize this is a significant amount but we are determined to reach our goal. We are excited about building something that is uniquely designed FULLY equipped with high tech digital State-of the-Art equipment and  electronics such as cameras, microphones, audio mixers, monitors, recorders, laptops, computers, CINTIQ pen-on-screen drawing, printers and other technology for the future of our students. 
 We will start by advancing ourselves as technology advances itself in the years to come in knowing and understanding it’s function.  We  are stepping out on faith and we would like your help in completing this wonderful project. Your donations will support, train and connect passionate teachers and engage families and communities to help  young adults with the skills they need to succeed in life!




By contributing you are joining an amazing team of compassionate and inspiring individuals who are making breakthroughs with tremendous outcomes in the communities soon the world. Our project is out of the ordinary, unique and  can reach the masses.  With your help we can conquer great concerns in our communities.  We are helping people to help themselves we want to make what seems impossible possible.






Here at Universal Production Studio we have a concern for our communities.  We want to offer our communities accessibility to all of our technology that's available this will allow all of us the opportunity to grow together.  Research reviews have generally concurred that when combined with traditional instruction, the use of computers  and technology can increase our learning in the traditional curriculum and basic skills area. The integration of computers with traditional instruction produces higher academic achievement in a variety of subject areas than does traditional instruction alone. We all learn more quickly and with greater retention when learning with the aid of computers  and technology.

       Today, I have Steve Jobs to thank for saving my life!
Many years ago in fact, 2004 I saw an advertisement about an Apple product that would read to me.  Due to my disability, I had years of not comprehending what people say or understanding what I read.  I heard about this product and knew this was what I needed. You see, I had a vision of making futuristic cabinets, and knew that this product would definitely save my life.

 I became passionate about my project and my Apple Computer. I bought the Talking Apple Computer and personally taught myself on how to use it. I am a perfectionist for wanting to learn every aspect in getting every detail right.  His product being so innovative, it helped me in all the right ways.  I sacrificed in waiting many years for this opportunity in sticking with it come hell or high water, I  am preparing to launch my project in appreciation for Apple's innovative products.
Having so much respect for my passion that I am willing to admit that I may have been a little bit fanatical, even over-the-top, but thanks to God and  Mr. Steve Jobs, and to all who I will never forget in making this all possible for me!  With your support I will be ready to launch this project next!
I must say my disability has it time of getting in my way but I won't let that get me down. For me, it's been my life in looking for people like you'll in helping me along the way. I am now 57 years old and my birthday is Nov. 3rd.  I started this  venture for my life purpose of being successful to see myself as someone special back in 1978. I do have all of my documents and papers to show I did start then. It is my wish to put all of my documents  on display for all to see here at Universal Production Studio/exhibit. I feel it will inspire others along the way through their journey for success.  So I thank you all for being here for me  in making this possible!  If there is to be success  for me Indiegogo is the key  .



These
new cabinet designs extract the essence of futurism and modernism at the same
time representing designs that support Apple product lines.  With its new
popular innovation from Universal Cabinet Designs. These entrainment centers
will change the way we interact with electronics and stereo equipment. “YOU
NEED TO EXPERIENCE IT!” The first example of a new concept we call “My Art” It
takes full advantage of multi-Touch technology all over it!

Consider the “front porch,” a new feature of the Open Learning neighborhood, where members greet each other in-person and connect with remote members via virtual dashboards. They hang out and virtually chat with people sitting at home, and feel connected to a sense of purpose andcommunity that extends well beyond the physical group.""
 

The Performing Arts Communities are perfectly setup to offer this Open Learning Neighborhood(OLN).
The PAGE Network...
• provides a flourishing, positive community.• teaches social comfortability skills.• teaches self-love and positivity.• gives a consistent educational outreach.• provides a creative opportunity for mentorships.• offers innovative performance opportunities.• gives inspiration, motivation, and support.
 

RISKS & CHALLENGES
Right now, the biggest risks at play are personnel consistency and general outreach momentum. Organizationally, a massive networking company based in independent contracts, needs an extremely sturdy, consistent base of Creators. Because we're building an intrinsic system to fit into the lifestyles of those reached out to, we now have an organic web of time, schedules, contracts and onboarding to fuel into our August Employment plans and continue funneling equipment into the community with YOUR contributions.
 

OTHER WAYS TO HELP
Joining any of the membership opportunities, sharing on social media, or spreading awareness are all ways to help.",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<h3><strong>Need in the World</strong></h3>
<p>In all corners of the world, there are people in need, people desperate to move their lives forward or find some semblance of progress. These are people who go without the things that we would call the necessities and struggle just to survive. To these people, things like books are luxuries. The world often looks to high-tech solutions for most things these days yet their need, may be best met with a low-tech solution. I feel a drive deep inside me to step up and make a difference in the world, acting as an agent for change any way that I can.     </p>

<h3><strong>A Vision of Change</strong></h3>
<p>My name is Gary Jones-Locke, originally from England, I have traveled extensively, visiting locations in the Middle East. The time that I spent there was informative for me, affording me a glimpse into where I could make most impact. I went on to build my own business on Amazon, processing more than a million books a month before bowing out due to out-of-control fees, and as I saw how frequently books were going to waste, I resolved to <i>do something</i>. There was an opportunity for good in all that disregard for our resources, and I was going to work it out one way or another.</p>

<p>Drawing on my experience and my passion, I am on a mission to re-purpose Shipping Containers and Millions of Books, saving all the best books to donate for the people who need books most. This may seem like a simple concept, but it will require serious planning and effort. Long-term, I am confident that my partner and I can make education more widely accessible than ever before, encouraging reading on a large scale in areas of the world where people can't get their hands on the books that they so desperately need.</p>

<h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></h3>
<p>Our goal through this campaign is to raise the funds necessary to launching Libraries in a Can.

<p>Indlondlo Zulu Dancers Cultural And Art Centre seeks progressives sponsorship towards a <strong>Indlondlo Cultural Village</strong> tourist attraction in the Mkhambathini Community in Cato Ridge area. It is a registered <strong>non profit organization (Reg 151-983NPO)</strong> and has a tax exemption in South Africa.</p>
<p>Background of the potential village</p>
<p>The village will belong to Indlondlo Zulu Dancers. Since this village being an idea (which is very inspiring), we are aiming of gathering the local talents and acts to perform and thus creating an awareness of the village whereby the community will know of our existences and know that we encouraging the heritage of South Africa and getting the general public to participate since the youth is influenced much by the western lifestyle and norms. This in turn creates job opportunities for +-100 people.</p>
<p>Description of the village</p>
<p>The village will be a traditional zulu setting homestead which includes structures such as huts with thatcher roofing, flooring which is cow dung (just to name a few). The village will consist of sleeping quarters for tourists wishing to stay. There will be a showcasing section which will have a seating area for 50 people, within this section we will provide zulu dancing lessons, indigenous games, sick fighting and beadwork lessons. A section for stalls where people will be selling traditional Attire as well as beadwork (souvenirs). There will be a section located for plantation (farming) and near it will be a section where clay pots will be moulded. Lastly there will be a kraal in the center of the village which will have cattle. The village is to be located in Ophokweni, Manyavu near Cato Ridge area. There are about over 20 locals supporting the concept and are enthusiastic due to possible job creation. The majority of the acts and employees will be locals from the Cato Ridge area.

<p>The ultimate mission of Indlondlo Zulu Dancers is to get tourist to visit them as we have toured many parts of the world and people plead to come visit us. So the event is a litmus test whether the village has a pedigree to fulfil the mission. This village has the best quality zulu dance performers hence we have travelled the world doing tours and the National Lotteries Commission has in principle funded many of our tours internationally as Indlondlo Zulu Dancers. The agreement between the National department of Arts and Culture is yet to be signed</p>

Our board consists of a diverse group of men and women who are committed to making a positive difference in Haiti.</p><p><strong>What We Do</strong></p><p>Haiti is a nation with a gorgeous landscape; blessed with the triple threat of beautiful beaches, breath-taking mountains and thick and lustrous forestry. Haiti was the first black nation to gain its independence in 1804. Its main exports were sugar and coffee and many great nations fought to have this land as their own. Over time this nation has fallen from decades of abandonment, corruption, illiteracy, natural disasters and poor leadership.</p><p>The 2010 earthquake that shook the tectonic plates over which Haiti sits and the recent restoration of Haiti’s democratic government may prove to be the potential springboard for the socioeconomic revival of this once great nation.

<li>Find opportunities to serve within Haiti and fund projects that aim to improve the environment, create job opportunities and highlight the beauty and riches of our country</li>
<li>Connect individuals and organizations who have project ideas for Haiti with investors who can fund these projects</li>
<li>Re-invest funds from membership dues, donations and apparel sales into the community by sponsoring health fairs, sports and recreational activities for the youth and environmental wellness projects</li>
</ul><p><strong>Why We Do It</strong></p><p>In 2014 we had an unfortunate experience with a fraudulent investor and as a result were unable to complete a project we had undertaken in Haiti. During this trying time we learned a few lessons:</p><ul>
<li>Developing a project requires a lot of time, dedication and planning</li>
<li>Finding funding to complete a project is difficult!… especially in a developing country due to concerns about economic instability</li>
<li>Banks are unwilling to invest in a project if 50% or more of required funds are not available</li>
</ul><p>Although the experience was difficult, the lessons learned led to our decision to create a portal that would connect individuals and organizations who have project ideas with vetted investors who can provide financial support for these projects. Furthermore, we thought to ourselves, who better to reach out to than the sons, daughters and friends of Haiti. Together, we are a force to be reckoned with.

We want to change this! … We want to be a center that provides a world class training facility to the hard working and dedicated athletes in Haiti who have committed their lives to excellence in their sport.</p><p>Recreational Park: As technology advances and invades every facet of our lives we need to make every effort to ensure that we and our children spend time outside.

<h3>Why it's important</h3>
<p>Seeing the children's face after visiting the museum makes this all worth it for Lakota Dream. During our time open, we believe we have made a strong statement about who the Lakota People are and why this museum is not here to offend, but to create a beautiful democracy between communities to create something powerful. With new exhibitions, and renovation to the museum, we can continue to change life's and teach the true history about the Lakota People. </p>
</div><div><p> </p></div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Any contribution we receive will make the biggest impact and go towards the growth of the Lakota Dream Museum. </p>
<p>One exhibition specifically is a space in the museum representing the board school era. Many children were taken from their family and lost through the boarding school system. In Rapid City, many families mourn till this day, we will have a space where their families can pray and honor their loved ones.</p>

</div></div>","Why it's important
Seeing the children's face after visiting the museum makes this all worth it for Lakota Dream. During our time open, we believe we have made a strong statement about who the Lakota People are and why this museum is not here to offend, but to create a beautiful democracy between communities to create something powerful. With new exhibitions, and renovation to the museum, we can continue to change life's and teach the true history about the Lakota People. 
 
The Impact
Any contribution we receive will make the biggest impact and go towards the growth of the Lakota Dream Museum. 
One exhibition specifically is a space in the museum representing the board school era. Many children were taken from their family and lost through the boarding school system. In Rapid City, many families mourn till this day, we will have a space where their families can pray and honor their loved ones.

<p>I have been building robots for years hoping that I can create something special for myself. Along the way, I realized that there are not very many resources out there for someone who wants to build something more than just a fancy RC car. Ever since then, I have been documenting my progress into numerous videos and lecture style PDFs and PowerPoints.</p>
<p>I have built something pretty amazing in the process and I want you to experience something totally incredible. BERT is beyond a toy. He can be practical with personal assistant applications and he is very comfortable in a classroom environment. </p>
<p>I am a Husband, a father, and a student, so it means a lot to me to make this a reality. I have worked hard to get where I am today and tomorrow I plan on working harder. That's part of having big dreams for me and my family!</p>
<p>We need your support to get the our first orders out the door. I have been in contact with suppliers and have built the robot and curriculum. Now I need your help to get this out the door so you can start building the robot you have been wanting!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We hope to sell our first batch of kits to raise at least $10,000. This will help us get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Components for campaign kits and kits for the future.</li>
<li>Extra help to fulfill orders and refine the design and look of both hardware and software</li>
<li>And with enough help, I can finally start building robots somewhere other than our bedroom. Trust me, my wife will really thank you for that!</li>
<li>But the bottom line is that I have had the dream of starting a robotics company ever since I was a kid. With a name like Gearhart, why not? Your support will give me the boost I need to make my dream a reality and to get awesome education kits out in this world, because BERT is too awesome for me to keep for myself!</li>
</ul>
<p>For your contribution you can receive:</p>
<ul>
<li>$1-10 You get a BIG thank you from me and my family and a mention in our Thank You video at the end of the campaign along with a mention at the end of our PDF that is included with the Education package.</li>
<li>$25 gets you a super cool T-shirt designed by us!

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I'm not going to say this is all going to be rainbows and butterflies. I am working to consolidate my component sources as much as possible so I don't have as many things looming with the possibility of failing. Obviously, if I don't sell enough kits, I wont be able to buy in bulk enough to bring the price down, but I will be aggressive to ensure we get the best prices from our suppliers.</p>
<p>I am working on my second degree in manufacturing engineering. I am comfortable with manufacturing and what it takes to get a product from concept to product, but I also need your support. With that, we can overcome these challenges and get BERT out to see the world!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute, no worries! But if you understand and like what I'm trying to accomplish here, it would mean the world to me and my family if you would share this campaign and help get the word out. I don't have much money to put into this project, so word of mouth is what I'm relying on! </p>
<h2>All About BERT</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3>Arduino + Raspberry Pi = BERT</h3>
<p>BERT uses the Raspberry Pi and Arduino schematics because of their huge support and community along with being very cost efficient and easy to use. Because of the amazing work these two companies have done, robots like BERT are able to happen at an affordable price. Along with our dozens of hours of video content, PDF and PowerPoint lectures, you get our customer support AND the support of thousands of tinker lovers online through these two powerful communities. Nothing about BERT is a secret. Nothing is proprietary. We explain every single detail in an organized fashion because our number one goal is to get the robots we have all been waiting for into the hands of the curious. What you do with BERT is up to you.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492217295/i7trzwj5ktgsbfgiwgdg.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Stacked Up for Competition</h3>
<p>His height is one of the many things that sets him apart from the rest. With the arm positioned at 40"" above the floor, you are able to interact with things on tables and counter tops. He is more than just a talking robot.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Now You Really Can Be Two Places At Once</h3>
<p>BERT can do Telepresence. He shows you how to build an HTML webpage for local access to his camera and all of his motors. This allows you to remotely control BERT over WiFi with full control of his arm and navigate around an area. You also get his video feed and are able to pan and tilt 180 degrees to look around and see where you are going. You can be anywhere within your network's WiFi range and control BERT.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>These Were the Objects You Were Looking For</h3>
<p>His camera also has another function; He is able to look down and see objects on tables and use that coordinate information to move the arm to that x,y location and grab the object.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492217422/bo3wmeyk7lsgxig4ehzt.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Mapping the Bitmap</h3>
<p>BERT uses a x,y coordinate system to plot his location in space. He makes it visual by plotting onto a bitmap. Imagine it like this: BERT starts at 235,54, which is his home location at the charger and is told to move to predetermined location set as ""THE COUCH"", which is at 88, 693. He then takes the shortest path there, utilizing the encoders that track his distance traveled and the digital compass that tells him what degree he is facing. The 8 ultrasonic sensors act like an invisible force field so he doesn't run into anything along the way.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>BERT is Also Your New Computer</h3>
<p>BERT is equipped with a Rapberry Pi 3 Model B with Raspbian OS installed. This is a version of Linux that is capable of almost everything you can do with a traditional PC. This allows for BERT OS to run, but also you can use Raspbian to do things like send email, surf the web, and even play Minecraft!</p>

</div><p> </p></div>","With the Monarch Butterfly survival kit​ young scientists will learn the basic concept of Electronics, Robotics and Electricity by building a Solar Powered Robotic Butterfly that flaps its wings using muscle wires (AKA shape memory metal alloy) and a circuit based in the popular (and young engineer’s favorite) 555 timer chip.They will also learn about the importance of Gender Equality in STEM fields. Ruby, the main character in the instructional comic book, is a supper smart nine-years-old nature lover and a science enthusiast that will guide us step-by-step with the help of STEM heroines such as Rachel Carson, Alice Hamilton and Jane C. Wright among others. Parts included on the ""Monarch Butterfly Survival Kit""Once your kids get their kit at home they will:
 Piece together the Robotic Butterfly

connect it to the Solar Panel to Power it
Assemble the circuit that controls the flapping action of the butterfly
Put the Milkweed seeds to germinate in the Tin Box 
 Wait few weeks and transplant the seeds to a flower pot or garden outdoors and place the robotic butterfly by its side.
In order to assemble the circuit you will use, along with the step-by-step instructional comic, the  laser-cut cardboard pattern included in the kit that indicates using a alphanumeric grid system(as in a crossword puzzle) where each electronic component goes.The next steps are; putting the milkweed seeds in the floral foam, Inserting the foam with the seeds in the tin box, water it and finally put the windowed lid back. You tin box turned into a Green house!Make sure to put the tin box by the window, the seeds need a good amount of sunlight to germinate big and healthy. After few weeks the seeds are grown enough to be transplanted to a flower pot outside (your tiny plants love real yummy soil!) and since they don't need the greenhouse anymore  take your assembled circuit and solar panel and put them inside so they are protected from the rain and bad weather. everything is ready for the grand finale. Take your waterproof robotic butterfly, solar panel and circuit and put them by your Milkweed growing plants. In few weeks your Monarch Butterfly Sanctuary will be ready to receive the exhausting traveling monarch butterflies moms ready to lay their eggs by your window. The milkweed seeds included in the kit are prepared to germinate in the floral foam packaging inside the tin box. As you can see the tin box has three different functions; first it is the packaging that keeps your survival kit neat and protected until you receive it at home, then it serves as a temporary greenhouse for you to germinate the seeds and last it is the waterproof container that will protect your assembled circuit and the solar panel when you’re ready to put your butterfly outside. As you can see nothing gets discarded with this green-designed product. TAKE ACTION!the Monarch Butterfly Survival Kit is a Do-It-Yourself assembling kit for the kids to have fun but also to learn to take action in favor of nature conservancy and gender equality at an early age.  GENDER EQUALITY ON STEM FIELDS When it comes to studying STEM subjects at school, girls and boys perform equally well.

<h3>Мојата животна приказна</h3>
<p>Здраво!</p>
<p>Се викам Андреј и мојот сон е да бидам Тренер за Личен Развој. Се започна додека бев студент и јас бев<strong> многу несреќен</strong>. Бев толку <strong>разочаран</strong> за мојата иднина со што морав да <strong>донесам одлука</strong> за да најдам начин како да станам среќен и исполнет. Почнав да барам помош на интернет, и започнав да читам книги кои беа мотивациски  каде целото однесување и психологија беа објаснети и разберени. Најдов многу луѓе кои ја споделуваа нивната трансформација, и јас започнав да ги применувам нивните стратегии и знаење во мојот живот. Пронајдов многу <strong>трауми од моето детство</strong> и многу <strong>потиснати сеќавања</strong> што ги носев вo мене. Ми требаше 3 години од постојано учење и соочување со предизвици за да оздравам. Научив многу стратегии за да ја вратам контролата врз мојот живот и да направам секаква промена. Сега верувам дека можам да помогнам и да го подобрам животот на секој кој е подготвен да креира живот исполнет со многу љубов, среќа и успех. </p>
<h3>До мене е </h3>
<p>Посакувам да бев само јас што беше низ сето ова ... но вистината е ...  јас направив голема трансформација, прашав многу прашања, пробував и имав многу неуспеси, Поминав преку многу искуства од кои научив многу вредни лекции со кои го направив мојот живот да бидам среќен и успешен. </p>
<p> Чувствувам дека имам одговорност (и привилегија) да го споделам тоа што го научив со колку што е можно повеќе луѓе, бидејки знам колку <strong>голема разлика</strong> може да креирам за секој, кој поминува низ вакви предизвици и дека  секогаш може да најде начин како да го направи својот живот посреќен. </p>
<h3>До тебе е </h3>
<p>За започнување на кариера за личен развој потребно  $3000 . Сите средства се наменети  за отварање фирма, за креирање на мојата кариера на Тренер за Личен Развој, за опрема (камера компјутер итн.) и да инвестирам во маркетинг со кои можам да организирам работилница и семинари и да ги учам моите стратегии на многу луѓе во светот. Бидејки сакам да обучувам многу луге ке треба цело време да ја се занимавам со оваа работа и  да ги покријам трошоците за сметки и  за станарина за следните 3-6 месеци.</p>

<h3>My Life Story </h3>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>My name is Andrej, My dream is to be a Personal Development Coach. Everything started when I was on college and I was<strong> very unhappy</strong>, I was so<strong> desperate</strong> about my future and I had to <strong>make a decision</strong> that I must find a way to feel more happy and fulfilled. I started to search online, and started reading books that was motivational and materials where all behavior and psychology of the people was understood. I found many people who were sharing their transformation and I started applying their strategies and knowledge in my life. I discovered a lot of <strong>trauma from childhood</strong> and many <strong>suppressed memories</strong> that I was carrying inside me. It took me 3 years of constant learning and facing  challenges to heal. I learned many tools and strategies to take control of my life and make any change that i wanted. Now i believe that i can help and improve the life of any person who is ready to create life filled with love, happiness and success.</p>
<h3>It's up to me</h3>
<p>I wish I could say that I'm the only one who went thought this... but the truth is... I  did a lot of transformation work, asked a lot of questions, tried and failed a lot. I learned many valuable lessons from many experiences that transformed my life completely.</p>
<p>I feel it is my responsibility (and privilege) to share what I learned with many people in the world, because I know what a <strong>profound difference</strong> it can make for anyone  who is going thought similar challenges and then they can realize all the opportunities and possibilities this life opens up for them.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1519988752/rnlea3kw9ljl8kzfrjom.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>And it's up to you </h3>
<p>For launching my Coaching career I need  $3000 and all the money<br/>are going to fund my costs for the company that i'm starting, buy new equipment (laptop, camera, etc), invest in marketing with which I can organize workshops and seminars to teach my skills to many people in the world. Because i love to teach many people i must to coach people full time and i also need to cover my monthly costs for housing and bills for next  3-6 months </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Rewards/PERKS</h3>
<p>To be more exiting, I created 5 cool rewards for any level of contribution.</p>
<p> You can choose any of these rewards, starting with $9 for a basic e-book, all the way to One Year contact for $299 which I believe will change your life completely (see all the rewards on the right-side column).</p>
<p>One of my favorite is 2 hours consultation where I will have online or live, one on one personal consultation with you, ask you a few questions and focus on improving your live and develop strategies that i believe can change your life forever. </p>
<p>I already have many experiences in working with people and completely changing and improving their personal and professional life. I feel that many people enjoy conversations with me, and i believe is because i'm always honest and authentic. I'm exited to have healing consultations with you if you decide to donate in one of the last 3 perks. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Final words</h3>
<p>Backing up this project will create meaningful life to many people, especially those who are living in anxiety and trauma just as i was, also with purchasing one of the perks and if you use the tools that i have learned during the last 3 years, your<strong> happiness and fulfillment is guaranteed</strong>. Not only that but when I reach the goal of funds my future is also guaranteed to make even greater impact in many other people lives.

Мојата животна приказна
Здраво!
Се викам Андреј и мојот сон е да бидам Тренер за Личен Развој. Се започна додека бев студент и јас бев многу несреќен. Бев толку разочаран за мојата иднина со што морав да донесам одлука за да најдам начин како да станам среќен и исполнет. Почнав да барам помош на интернет, и започнав да читам книги кои беа мотивациски  каде целото однесување и психологија беа објаснети и разберени. Најдов многу луѓе кои ја споделуваа нивната трансформација, и јас започнав да ги применувам нивните стратегии и знаење во мојот живот. Пронајдов многу трауми од моето детство и многу потиснати сеќавања што ги носев вo мене. Ми требаше 3 години од постојано учење и соочување со предизвици за да оздравам. Научив многу стратегии за да ја вратам контролата врз мојот живот и да направам секаква промена. Сега верувам дека можам да помогнам и да го подобрам животот на секој кој е подготвен да креира живот исполнет со многу љубов, среќа и успех. 
До мене е 
Посакувам да бев само јас што беше низ сето ова ... но вистината е ...  јас направив голема трансформација, прашав многу прашања, пробував и имав многу неуспеси, Поминав преку многу искуства од кои научив многу вредни лекции со кои го направив мојот живот да бидам среќен и успешен. 
 Чувствувам дека имам одговорност (и привилегија) да го споделам тоа што го научив со колку што е можно повеќе луѓе, бидејки знам колку голема разлика може да креирам за секој, кој поминува низ вакви предизвици и дека  секогаш може да најде начин како да го направи својот живот посреќен. 
До тебе е 
За започнување на кариера за личен развој потребно  $3000 . Сите средства се наменети  за отварање фирма, за креирање на мојата кариера на Тренер за Личен Развој, за опрема (камера компјутер итн.) и да инвестирам во маркетинг со кои можам да организирам работилница и семинари и да ги учам моите стратегии на многу луѓе во светот. Бидејки сакам да обучувам многу луге ке треба цело време да ја се занимавам со оваа работа и  да ги покријам трошоците за сметки и  за станарина за следните 3-6 месеци.

 
Награди/Бонуси
Да  биде восхитувачко креирав 5 интересни награди за секое ниво на донација. 
Можеш да избереш по една од овие награди, започувајки со $9 за мала е-книга се до една година контакт за $299 која верувам дека ќе ти го промени животот целосно (разгледај ги сите награди во десната колона).
Омилена од сите ми е 2 часа лична консултација онлине, или во живо ако си од Македонија или соседните држави каде јас ке ти поставам неколку прашања и ке се фокусирам на статегии и алатки кои можат да ти го сменат животот целосно. 
Јас досега имам многу искуство во работа со луѓе и комплетна промена и подобрување на нивниот личен и професионален живот. Чуствувам дека многу луѓе уживаат во разговори со мене, и јас верувам дека е поради тоа што секогаш сум искрен и автентичен. Јас сум восхитен  да имам прекрасна консултација тебе ако одлучиш да избереш еден од последните 3 подароци. 
Завршни зборови
Подржувајки го овој проект ке помогнеш на многу луѓе да креираат значаен живот, највеќе на сите луѓе кои живеат во анкциозност и траума исто како што јас бев, а исто така со донирање на последните 3 подароци од десната страна  и ако ги примениш овие алатки што ги научив овие две-три години твојата среќа и исполнетост е загарантирано. Не само тоа но кога ќе ги имам потребните пари мојата иднина е исто така загарантирана за да го живеам мојот сон и да достигнам до колку што е можно повеќе луѓе. Мојата визија е да организирам семинари и работилници и да работам со луѓе , бидејки кога јас излечам еден во публиката и другите можат да се излечат истовремено. Секој е повеќе од добредојден за да биде дел од ваква емоционална атмосфера. Бидејки научив добро да зборувам Англиски јазик мојот сон во иднина е да им помагам на лугето на светско ниво и да ги охрабрувам да превземат контрола врз нивната судбина. 
Ризици и Предизвици
Како и секој проект, има секогаш непредвидливи ризици кои можат да се создадат заради различни причини кои не се под моја контрола вклучувајки го мојот личен живот или некоја непланирана случка. Како и да е јас сум многу самоуверен  и сум снаодлив за да се справам со секаков вид на предизвици кои можат да излезат додека трае процесот.  Ке бидам искрен, транспарентен за секој можен предизвик и ке ве информирам за се што се случува.
И ако сакаш да ми помогнеш, но неможеш да донираш тоа е супеееер! 
Можеш исто така да помогнеш со споделување на твоите другари или роднини да ја пришират оваа прекрасна кампања!

My Life Story 
Hey!
My name is Andrej, My dream is to be a Personal Development Coach. Everything started when I was on college and I was very unhappy, I was so desperate about my future and I had to make a decision that I must find a way to feel more happy and fulfilled. I started to search online, and started reading books that was motivational and materials where all behavior and psychology of the people was understood. I found many people who were sharing their transformation and I started applying their strategies and knowledge in my life. I discovered a lot of trauma from childhood and many suppressed memories that I was carrying inside me. It took me 3 years of constant learning and facing  challenges to heal. I learned many tools and strategies to take control of my life and make any change that i wanted. Now i believe that i can help and improve the life of any person who is ready to create life filled with love, happiness and success.
It's up to me
I wish I could say that I'm the only one who went thought this... but the truth is... I  did a lot of transformation work, asked a lot of questions, tried and failed a lot. I learned many valuable lessons from many experiences that transformed my life completely.
I feel it is my responsibility (and privilege) to share what I learned with many people in the world, because I know what a profound difference it can make for anyone  who is going thought similar challenges and then they can realize all the opportunities and possibilities this life opens up for them.

And it's up to you 
For launching my Coaching career I need  $3000 and all the moneyare going to fund my costs for the company that i'm starting, buy new equipment (laptop, camera, etc), invest in marketing with which I can organize workshops and seminars to teach my skills to many people in the world. Because i love to teach many people i must to coach people full time and i also need to cover my monthly costs for housing and bills for next  3-6 months 
 
Rewards/PERKS
To be more exiting, I created 5 cool rewards for any level of contribution.
 You can choose any of these rewards, starting with $9 for a basic e-book, all the way to One Year contact for $299 which I believe will change your life completely (see all the rewards on the right-side column).
One of my favorite is 2 hours consultation where I will have online or live, one on one personal consultation with you, ask you a few questions and focus on improving your live and develop strategies that i believe can change your life forever. 
I already have many experiences in working with people and completely changing and improving their personal and professional life. I feel that many people enjoy conversations with me, and i believe is because i'm always honest and authentic. I'm exited to have healing consultations with you if you decide to donate in one of the last 3 perks. 
 
Final words
Backing up this project will create meaningful life to many people, especially those who are living in anxiety and trauma just as i was, also with purchasing one of the perks and if you use the tools that i have learned during the last 3 years, your happiness and fulfillment is guaranteed. Not only that but when I reach the goal of funds my future is also guaranteed to make even greater impact in many other people lives. My dream is to organize seminars and workshops and work  with people because when I heal one person, the others who are present can learn how to heal in the same time. Everyone  will be more than welcome to be part of such healing atmosphere. Because of my knowledge of speaking English my dream for the future is to help people worldwide and encourage them to take control of their destiny.
 

Risks & Challenges
As with any project, there are always unforeseeable risks that can arise due to a variety of factors beyond my control including my personal life and any unplanned event.  However,I'm confident in my ability and expertise to deal with any challenges that may arise during the process. I will be honest, transparent about any possible challenge and will keep you in a loop down the road..
 

And, if you'd like to help me out, but can't make a donation, that is oookay!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are an interdisciplinary team (engineers, designers, teachers) who seek through this project to improve learning skills in early childhood, so we will talk about BunnyCode below.</p>
<p>New technologies allow the development of new forms of learning, strengthening among other things: critical thinking, problem solving creativity, communications and cooperative work. Nowadays it is possible to acquire different types of robots and electronic tools that allow young children to get closer to the programming. Talking about the elements mentioned above, there are few products that offer tangible programming, because most of them base their functionality on tablets, and then, these are less convenient for the time of exposure to the screen.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528251939/vfd8id41aqekjskn55jf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><i>BunnyCode</i> is a self-learning kit for tangible programming for early childhood that will change the way children learn about the world. It has a wide set of instructions in blocks that make different programs when children join them to move the bunny to a specific place or use their sensors to recognize an obstacle, some noise or light, all this depending on the objective of the activity The objective of the product is to involve children with programming so that they acquire skills such as: laterality, eye-hand coordination, visual perception, abstract thinking and self-learning. Your help will allow us to continue with the development of this project, and will give us the opportunity to continue our journey.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1528251814/dy4p0msne1zsqfzjnrjb.jpg"" src=""""/></p> <p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>It is a product of easy access, which is for self-learning, at an accessible price, greater functionality, it is tangible, the use of screens is avoided, it has a greater diversity of basic blocks for tangible programming and it involves parents and family in the process of learning</p>
<p>Well, our project development needs this amount of money:</p>
<p><i>Funding needed</i>: <strong>$100.000 USD</strong></p>
<p>However, if this campaign doesn't reach the needed funding, your contributions won´t be accepted and we will start again this campaign. Now, we'll explain in a general way in what the gathered funding will be invested:</p>
<ul>
<li>Components</li>
<li>Raw materials and supplies</li>
<li>Desing</li>
<li>Fixed costs</li>
<li>Advertising</li>
<li>Taxes</li>
<li>Other expenses</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, related to what you can get, we've created a complete set of unique perks, that you can obtain depending on the range of funding where you clasify. </p>
<p>You can find more detailed information in - 3. Perks section.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Programming is a useful skill in current times. Indeed, a high number of future jobs will be taken by people with programming abilities, regardless their major choice. That's why it is important to encourage children to think in a logical way, in order to achieve a goal/solve a problem, by programming.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, children aged between 3 and 6 found the learning process slightly different from older kids. We are aware of this fact; therefore the concept of tangible programming gets into scene. First of all, our product doesn’t rely in tablets, PC’s or any device with a screen, given that doctors recommend not to use them more than two hours per day for children between 4 and 8 years old. We want kids to have the opportunity of touching and arranging  blocks, in order to create a sequence; that action would give the bunny a path or command to carry out. This way makes easier the self-learning process we want kids aqcuire.</p>
<p>At this moment, we have developed a prototype, assessed its functionality and also, we were able to detect risks, challenges and potencial improvements for the future product. You can follow our progress in the Bunny's social networks and  website, and then, contribute to this project! </p>

</div> <div> <h3>WHY DO I WRITE THIS BOOK</h3> <p></p>
<p>When I was a
child, I had an interesting dream in which I was a bottle. People bought me
from supermarket and brought me to their home. They used me all the time during
the day. When I was empty, I was thrown away to roadsides, not even into
dustbins. A person came across me and kicked me to the middle of the road.
Every day, lots of people passed me with no thinking, no emotion. It seemed to
me that they didn’t take any notice of my existence. At night, it rained
heavily, I felt so alone, so cold because there was no one around me. Maybe I
was born for being filled with liquids and was thrown away like that, I
couldn’t suffer for that. I desired to dedicate for human with many usages such
as a flower vase, a pen box or other decorations which I would be actually
useful. </p>

When I woke up, I thought that all inanimate
things in houses had their own souls. I had an idea: What if I helped those
inanimate things reborn into different shapes? Immediately, I put thought into
actions. From that day, I have made many beautiful, useful and respectful toys,
tools or decorations in my house. Now I have two children, I always teach them
be respectful for tools in our house. Every weekend, I take used things and
teach them know how to recycle, they are excited about. Gradually, my children
create a lot of decorations in house from used things. I think that people
should be aware of protecting the environment and having habits of using
recycled things. I decide to write this book aiming to bring all recycled
things to people in my country and other countries in the world so that they
can make by themselves and teach their children. If so, our environment will be
green, clean and healthy. </div><div><b>BOOK COVER </b></div><div>

Who are we? What do we
live for? How should we live? 
Currently, our environment is becoming destroyed and losses of the
beauty of its nature. Every day, lots of bottles, cans are thrown away outside
without recycling. Hence, this book includes all methods to recycle used
things. 

What will this book
be used for? First, it can be used for building habit of recycling in families
and organizations. However, what makes this book special is the way to make old
relationships seemed to be forgotten reborn. 

Teaching children know how to create
recycled things

It
focuses on helping children know how to recycle used things and educate them as
well. The awareness of children is affected by you - their parents. Therefore, you
should teach them to be respectful to tools, furniture in the house and raise
awareness of protecting environment.
Inculcating
children with habits of recycling used things at small age is the best way to
protect environment. It is a good way for parents to nurture positive thinking
in children’s mind.

Building recycle culture in schools,
offices, companies or organizations

You
are a director, a boss who always want to keep the company clean and reduce the
amount of money spent on unnecessary things. If so, why don’t you set up
recycle culture in order to protect environment in your organization? After
each working day, lots of things are put in the dustbin while they can still be
used for other purposes in the working place. Staffs can use it to make many
recycled things they want such as pen box, flower vase... This book will instruct
you to make recycled things like that and people can give these crafts as presents
for each other. 
  Making old relationships reborn 

Siblings

For
how long have you not seen your sibling? Time makes the distance and
relationship be farther and farther between you and him/her. What did two of
you often do during your childhood? It is so interesting when you and (s)he gather
together in one hour or more to make something like crafts in the past, enjoy the
time and feel excited. In this book, you can find many other fantastic recycled
things to do with your sibling. So, why not give it a try?

Close friends

You
can not only use this book to teach their children but also share it with other
parents as a good educational method. Especially in gatherings of parents when you
meet and talks about their family and jobs, you can share their recycle
experience with each other. This book contains various types of recycled things
which are quite easy for children to create under their parents’ instruction. 
This book will be a
chance for you to improve your relationships and a useful guide to recycling
things and protect our environment. 


  WHY DO I WRITE THIS BOOK 
When I was a
child, I had an interesting dream in which I was a bottle. People bought me
from supermarket and brought me to their home. They used me all the time during
the day. When I was empty, I was thrown away to roadsides, not even into
dustbins. A person came across me and kicked me to the middle of the road.
Every day, lots of people passed me with no thinking, no emotion. It seemed to
me that they didn’t take any notice of my existence. At night, it rained
heavily, I felt so alone, so cold because there was no one around me. Maybe I
was born for being filled with liquids and was thrown away like that, I
couldn’t suffer for that. I desired to dedicate for human with many usages such
as a flower vase, a pen box or other decorations which I would be actually
useful. 

When I woke up, I thought that all inanimate
things in houses had their own souls. I had an idea: What if I helped those
inanimate things reborn into different shapes? Immediately, I put thought into
actions. From that day, I have made many beautiful, useful and respectful toys,
tools or decorations in my house. Now I have two children, I always teach them
be respectful for tools in our house. Every weekend, I take used things and
teach them know how to recycle, they are excited about. Gradually, my children
create a lot of decorations in house from used things. I think that people
should be aware of protecting the environment and having habits of using
recycled things. I decide to write this book aiming to bring all recycled
things to people in my country and other countries in the world so that they
can make by themselves and teach their children. If so, our environment will be
green, clean and healthy. BOOK COVER

<h3><strong>My Story and Inspiration</strong></h3>
<p>I am Abhishek Kaushik, an 18-year-old aspiring entrepreneur currently doing my BTech in Computer Science Engineering from Silicon Institute of Technology, Bhubaneswar. I have always had the urge to do something different and create a positive impact on the society around me, and hence I started my first startup MeteOut when I was in my 11<sup>th</sup> Standard. MeteOut acted as a scrap-dealer aggregator, in which citizens could sit at home and book scrap dealers to visit your home, I coded the app for it within 60 days by learning Android Development. The app also had a special feature to donate books and other useful items to orphanages. This was indeed where my journey began and till now it has been full of ups &amp; downs.</p>
<p>Back in 2017, I was selected for DexSchool of Leadership &amp; Entrepreneurship, where I along with 49 other best minds of the country worked &amp; learned together under the guidance of Sharad Vivek Sagar, a Forbes-listed 30 under 30 CEO. This experience infilled in me deep love for entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Coming back from Dex, I along with 5 other friends of mine started an organization called Quizzard which conducted quizzes for the students of Cuttack, Odisha. We conducted our first ever successful event called “Synapse-The Junction of Qriosity”. We started this with an aim to solve the problem of declining opportunities &amp; exposure which the students of Cuttack city aren’t getting.</p>
<p>Within a few months, I got selected for Young India Challenge 9<sup>th</sup> Edition, Mumbai, where I worked in a team along with other members to solve a UN-listed Sustainable Development Goal. We worked towards finding a solution to providing Quality Education.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With an aim to build a startup which solves a problem, I want to give back to the community.Currently, I am helping a close friend of mine in his startup-Woomie, which is a hostel aggregator. Some of my inspirations are Mark Cuban-for his utmost dedication and hard work, Bill Gates-for his dedication to affect the lives of billions of people through Microsoft as well as other philanthropic activities, Steve Jobs-for his extreme passion and attention to detail.  All of these great men have worked hard and brought change around them, and I believe <strong>each one of us</strong> has the ability to bring a change in the world around us. We just need to ask ourselves -""If not <strong>YOU</strong>, <strong>Who</strong>? If not <strong>NOW</strong>, <strong>When</strong>?""</p>
<h3><strong>About Draper University</strong></h3>
<p>I applied for Draper University in January and after essay and Skype round, I got selected for the program with a 20% scholarship. Draper University was founded by venture capitalist Tim Draper.The program is known as Hero Training Summer program, which is of 5 weeks. At Draper University, we will go from an idea to a product ready to pitch to 80+ venture capital investors as we learn from top-tier venture capitalists and entrepreneurs. Past speakers include Elon Musk (Tesla), Aaron Levie (Box), and Tony Hsieh (Zappos). There are about 580+ alumni who have launched their own startups, raised $51.4M+ in total, and have sold their companies for multiple millions and have been featured in Forbes 30 under 30. </p>

<h3><strong>How I will benefit from the program</strong></h3>
<p>This 5-week long program in the heart of Silicon Valley will empower me with the right tools, skills &amp; network to help me strengthen my skills as an entrepreneur and be prepared to face the tough world of startups.

<p>I am hopeful that with your support, I would be able to reach my goal, however, if I don’t, all the funds would be used to fund my tuition and travel to participate in Draper University.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I am on a mission to give back to the society for whatever I have gained from it. Over these few years, I have realized that the society needs more contributors now than ever before. Contribution doesn’t always mean charity or helping distribute food packets among the beggars. Bill Gates created Windows OS which is currently being used by millions of people across the globe. Elon Musk created Tesla which has disrupted the electric car industry and hence leading closer to pollution free world. I want to be one of them, I want to contribute to the society with my startup and <strong>YOU</strong> can help me in my mission. Whether I am able to or not able to fund my expenses and attend Draper’s University is not a factor which is going to affect my dedication and determination to contribute to the society. The program will help me get the skills and right set of tools to help me in my mission. But you can certainly help a young teenager by supporting him in his mission.</p>

<h3><strong>A big thank you for your support</strong></h3>

<h3>About TeslaTech</h3>
<p><i><strong>TeslaTech is a publisher of extreme science, alternative energy, health and medicine with a particular emphasis on Tesla Technology. </strong></i>Our latest magazine, <strong><i>ExtraOrdinary Science &amp; Technology</i></strong>  contains articles on a wide range of topics which tend to stick to hard science and experimental research. Our efforts are primarily directed to the independent researchers and inventor as there is a need for them to have a credible platform to publish their findings.</p>
<p><i><strong>Every August we have a conference in Albuquerque, NM. </strong></i>You don't need a degree to have an idea to change the world. The problem is that if you are not a part of the professional or academic world there isn't a good way to introduce the concept to the world... and while the internet showed promise, it quickly degenerated into a quagmire of fraud, deceit, and meritless claims. Furthermore, the explosion of the InterNet has inadvertently isolated independent researchers in an ocean of white noise data. Our magazine and conference provides a great opportunity for inventors to actually meet real people and make some friends who share eclectic interests. </p>
<p><i><strong>Hardware… NOT hot air! </strong></i> This conference is focused on sifting hardware from hot air! We place a premium on experimental science and prototypes. While there a lot of great demos on  the InterNet, they can be misleading... and visitations can get expensive. However, these conferences provide for a demonstrations before a live audience!  Steve Elswick, our publisher, has been putting together Tesla and ExtraOrdinary Technology conferences for over 30 years as the most cost efficient way of determining the BS factor inherent in many of these inventions. </p>
<p><i><strong>Building the Future...  </strong></i>The conference inspires the mind, reinforces friendships, and allows everyone an opportunity to have a great time!  Our 'Teens are FREE!' program is intended to get students involved in critical thinking at a young age. My personal interest in science and technology was inspired by visits to places like the Chicago Museum of Science &amp; Industry. Watching stuff on computers is one thing... but being able to actually handle real equipment brings it to life... and becomes the difference between believing and knowing!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><i><strong>Our goal is $25000  </strong></i>to provide operating capital which will help us to</p>
<ul>
<li>promote the conference</li>
<li>offset direct conference expenses</li>
<li>print the magazine in a timely fashion</li>
<li>upgrade our facilities/equipment and</li>
<li>implement an online membership site which will feature about 2000 conference videos.  </li>
</ul>
<p>All  gifts and funds received will be designated as operating capital and will be utilized to achieve the goals as laid out above. Every little bit helps.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
</div><div>
<p><i>The scientific man does not aim at an immediate result. He does not expect that his advanced ideas will be readily taken up. His work is like that of the planter – for the future. His duty is to lay the foundation for those who are to come, and point the way. </i><b>__ Nikola Tesla </b></p>
<p>This quote by Tesla is our creed! The focus of our efforts here is to lay the foundation for the future. Many of the ideas and concepts that are the hot ideas today were ridiculed just a few short years ago... but kept alive through the perseverance of independent thinkers and garage inventors. Our magazine and conference provide an avenue for these ideas to gain public awareness and ultimately the academic and/or corporate world. Furthermore, our events provide  a venue where inventor,  researchers,  investors, students and others can meet and learn from each other.</p>
<p>Your participation will help expand the scope and awareness of our operation. With every person we reach directly, I believe that our information is passed on to 2 or more. Our problem in the past is that the severe austerity we function under, prevents timely mailing of our program. Your early participation will help us get the program mailed early this year... our target is early February<i>. Past experience indicates that this could double the attendance!</i></p>
<p><i>I know there are a million reasons not to come this year. However, I encourage you to cast your misgivings to the wind and<strong> take the plunge</strong>. No one is getting younger... and while it takes some effort to attend conferences, it is worth the endeavor just to meet old friends... as they may not be around next year. For that matter, I, too, am in a spot where the road ahead is shorter than behind (barring some longevity miracle I run into at the conference)!</i></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Steve has conducted these type of  conferences  for over thirty years... and has been publishing magazines for just as long. During that time he has encountered just about every problem an organizer faces. However, persistence and the high quality of volunteers we attract, has given the wherewithal to survive and the incentive to organize the next. But... this is not enough to dramatically increase the size of our audience and the continued existence of a forum for experimentally based researchers. </p>
<p>The shiny toys of the past few generations have been computers and programming. To excel in truly aspirational goals such as antigravity and utilization of zero point energy, we must encourage younger people to pursue Tesla-based research. For me, there is nothing to get me interested than handling real hardware!</p>
<p>You, too, can be part of the science of the Future simply by becoming a member, or attending a  conference. Bring a friend... if you have a teen around the house, take them to the conference!After all, teens get  free admission!</p>
<p>Visualize meeting some old friends for a great time... or perhaps visiting with a fellow researcher who has tons of information on your pet project... or even bump into a venture capitalist who is looking for new project to fund! Anything can happen at a Tesla Conference!</p>

Furthermore, our events provide  a venue where inventor,  researchers,  investors, students and others can meet and learn from each other.
Your participation will help expand the scope and awareness of our operation. With every person we reach directly, I believe that our information is passed on to 2 or more. Our problem in the past is that the severe austerity we function under, prevents timely mailing of our program. Your early participation will help us get the program mailed early this year... our target is early February. Past experience indicates that this could double the attendance!
I know there are a million reasons not to come this year. However, I encourage you to cast your misgivings to the wind and take the plunge. No one is getting younger... and while it takes some effort to attend conferences, it is worth the endeavor just to meet old friends... as they may not be around next year. For that matter, I, too, am in a spot where the road ahead is shorter than behind (barring some longevity miracle I run into at the conference)!

Risks & Challenges
Steve has conducted these type of  conferences  for over thirty years... and has been publishing magazines for just as long. During that time he has encountered just about every problem an organizer faces. However, persistence and the high quality of volunteers we attract, has given the wherewithal to survive and the incentive to organize the next. But... this is not enough to dramatically increase the size of our audience and the continued existence of a forum for experimentally based researchers. 
The shiny toys of the past few generations have been computers and programming. To excel in truly aspirational goals such as antigravity and utilization of zero point energy, we must encourage younger people to pursue Tesla-based research. For me, there is nothing to get me interested than handling real hardware!
You, too, can be part of the science of the Future simply by becoming a member, or attending a  conference. Bring a friend... if you have a teen around the house, take them to the conference!After all, teens get  free admission!
Visualize meeting some old friends for a great time... or perhaps visiting with a fellow researcher who has tons of information on your pet project... or even bump into a venture capitalist who is looking for new project to fund! Anything can happen at a Tesla Conference!

Other Ways You Can Help


If you are a writer or researcher... you may wish to speak at our conference or get an article published.  Contact TeslaTech.info and we can send you information on our policies. 

Pass this information on to those who may be interested... you can use the tools provided to make it easier.

Volunteer! We can use advice and assistance in a wide variety of areas!

Keep us informed! Clue us in on obscure up and coming devices!

Thank you for your support!Every time you purchase an item from us, you help us grow. We appreciate your support and never take it for granted. This year your support is particularly important as we are trying to develop an online membership site and update our current site.   If you are in a position to help sponsor some of our activities, please consider it and contact me at (520) 252-0374… or perhaps buy some DVDs!!!The scientific man does not aim at an immediate result. He does not expect that his advanced ideas will be readily taken up. His work is like that of the planter – for the future. His duty is to lay the foundation for those who are to come, and point the way. __ Nikola Tesla",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>My name is Marty, and I do not claim to be a Christian. Regardless, since 2010 I have wanted to read the Bible in its entirety. I believe that as an American, gaining a personal understanding of the book that sits at the foundation of our country is important for thoughtful citizenship in our great country.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The <strong>Cover-to-Cover</strong> service helps you and I achieve our personal goal of reading the entire Bible (or just the Old Testament or New Testament) in a single year. It addresses two main problems with self-guided reading plans:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Accountability</strong>. Humans stay more committed when they have skin in the game. Cover-to-Cover is a paid service that connects you with other similarly motivated individuals, creating social and financial incentives for you to finish the marathon.</li>
<li>
<strong>Comprehension</strong>. If you're planning to read the entire Bible, chances are you also want <i>understand</i> what you're reading. On your own, you can scour the internet and hope you find good answers, but this tactic is hit-or-miss and creates fatigue. Cover-to-Cover provides a qualified, non-denominational guide to handle Q&amp;A <i>live</i> on your year-long journey.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/mark.kwiatkowski.585"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mark Kwiatkowski</a> will be your full-time guide for the program in 2017.

For years, since I was around 8 years old, I've been strongly attracted to the USA : I was still in primary school when I started learning English, saying I would live there someday. No one in my family had ever lived in an English-speaking country, therefore I was really on my own. However, I never gave up : through the years (more precisely when I started surfing), “I want to live in the US” became “I'm going to go study in California as soon as possible”.</p><p><br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431889659/uvw0kzxrgj3qyekrpgco.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>Me surfing on the French Côte Sauvage in 2013<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1431851879/jmsm6zane1jrngfkkzyq.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 316.141304347826px; height: 210px;""/> Holidays at the 2013 US Open of Surfing</p> <p></p><p><br/></p><p>	Today, I'm 17, and this year is very important because I'll be graduating from high school very soon, which means it's time for me to move ! I kept working hard and learning English to be able to actually make it through the applications : that was way easier to say than to do. You probably know how hard it can be for American students, well, now imagine what it was to do it outside the US, taking the tests and writing the essays in a foreign language ! Anyways, I made it : a month ago or so, I received several letters from Californian universities which said I was accepted.

For years, since I was around 8 years old, I've been strongly attracted to the USA : I was still in primary school when I started learning English, saying I would live there someday. No one in my family had ever lived in an English-speaking country, therefore I was really on my own. However, I never gave up : through the years (more precisely when I started surfing), “I want to live in the US” became “I'm going to go study in California as soon as possible”.Me surfing on the French Côte Sauvage in 2013 Holidays at the 2013 US Open of Surfing 	Today, I'm 17, and this year is very important because I'll be graduating from high school very soon, which means it's time for me to move ! I kept working hard and learning English to be able to actually make it through the applications : that was way easier to say than to do. You probably know how hard it can be for American students, well, now imagine what it was to do it outside the US, taking the tests and writing the essays in a foreign language ! Anyways, I made it : a month ago or so, I received several letters from Californian universities which said I was accepted. I had never felt so happy !The Léman Lake when I took the SAT in Geneva. Some of the cool letters	Unfortunately, my joy didn't last very long : only the most expensive universities gave me financial aid, and it was so low they remained way too expensive to be considered.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Freedom Team is a collective of Financial Freedom Fighters who empower families, companies, and communities to break free of debt, build generational wealth and increase their financial intelligence through financial education. In association with the WSB's<br/>National Campaign for Financial Literacy, we have a mission to empower 1 million families with a wealth-building mindset an established financial foundation.</p>
<p>We developed the Financial Freedom Fighter Academy because we believe that our children must be equipped with a proper financial education if want them to excel in the new economy.  Execution without education is a fantasy. Financial literacy is a critical ingredient for financial freedom. The FFFA curriculum is designed to ignite the spirit of pride, community, and wealth-building in our students. We breakdown basic money principles such as ""pay yourself first"" and the ""rule of 72"".  We also examine items such as exponential growth, compound interest and so much more.  We will use text such as the ""Richest Man in Babylon"" and Dennis Kimbro's ""Think and Grow Rich: The Black Choice"" and much more.  The Financial Freedom Fighter Academy is a virtual, 12-week program that upon completion participants will have a thorough understanding of how to build a financial foundation. They will also be exposed to immediately applicable investment strategies and wealth concepts.  </p>
<p>Currently there is a nearly insurmountable wealth disparity. Knowledge is and always has been the ultimate equalizer. Early exposure is key. Contributions to our campaign will help to increase our ability to serve and empower more students and their families. The FFFA is dedicated to the delivery of financial education. We accept students at any rate they can afford to pledge.  Our monthly is tuition is $60 per month however we understand that cost can be a prohibiting factor. We also know once our Youth are exposed to a wealth-building ideology they will never be the same. Once they complete our program they will see the wisdom in investing in personal development. Also, a small sum such as $60 will never be viewed as an obstacle again. Donations will directly sponsor youth ages 13-20 by subsidizing the tuition for the 12-week wealth academy.  Pretty cool right. We think so too. We want to add prosperity to the culture. Our young people are the culture and they excel at everything they set their hands too. It's up to us to provide them with the knowledge they require to reach their full potential.  </p>

However, we are accepting students at any reasonable rate they pledge. We want affordability to be a non-issue for our students. We believe eliminating this hurdle is essential especially for economically challenged families and/or ambitious youth that sign up with no parental support. As a community we must invest in the development of our young people! We believe that our students should have peace of mind while studying.

<strong>Enhanced Student Experience</strong>- Our youth are bombarded with information, request, homework, DMs, Hashtags and so much more.  We have to earn their attention and maintain engagement. Our services must be delivered seamlessly and socially. We will enhance our website to include interactive features including a student portal. We will also develop an app that integrates social media platforms our students and their peers are already using.

What We Need & What You Get
We are raising $ 10,000.

These funds will be utilized to subsidize tuition, invest in enhanced student experience, and expand our education services.


Subsidize Tuition- We eliminated cost as a prohibiting factor. Our tuition is $60 per month ($180 for the complete course). However, we are accepting students at any reasonable rate they pledge. We want affordability to be a non-issue for our students. We believe eliminating this hurdle is essential especially for economically challenged families and/or ambitious youth that sign up with no parental support. As a community we must invest in the development of our young people! We believe that our students should have peace of mind while studying. This is can only be maintained by  community contributions. 

Enhanced Student Experience- Our youth are bombarded with information, request, homework, DMs, Hashtags and so much more.  We have to earn their attention and maintain engagement. Our services must be delivered seamlessly and socially. We will enhance our website to include interactive features including a student portal. We will also develop an app that integrates social media platforms our students and their peers are already using. Finally we will hire social influencers to be guest instructors and honorary ambassadors.  

Expand Our Education Services- Reaching 500 families is noble but, it is far from enough. We must impact millions of families as soon as possible.  Basic financial literacy and wealth-building mindset are bare necessities in this ever disparate economy.

Om de crowdfunding campagne te laten slagen en het zo duidelijk mogelijk te
maken heb ik de volgende constructie bedacht. Bedrijven kunnen mij helpen door
te doneren met een minimum van <b><span>2.500 euro</span></b>. In ruil
hiervoor krijgt u een promotionele bedrijfsvideo gemaakt door mij (Frank). Dit
houdt in dat ik een dag langs kom om te filmen en interviews af te nemen en
twee montage revisies. Mocht u geïnteresseerd zijn om meer te krijgen (meer
opnamedagen, meer montage revisies of een grotere productie waarde) dan is dat
altijd mogelijk, ik maak graag een offerte op maat gericht op specifieke wensen. Er zijn drie verschillende
levels waarbij de eerste het algemene Indiegogo doel is. Als dit doel wordt
gehaald zal het geld worden opgehaald en aan mij worden uitbetaald. Het
uiteindelijke doel is om het laatste level te bereiken, wat level 3 is, zodat
ik drie jaar kan studeren en mijn Bachelor of Fine Arts in Filmmaking kan gaan
halen aan de NYFA in Los Angeles.<br/><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/><b>·</b></span><b><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">

Mijn eerste korte film genaamd Limbo de film (Limbo the movie) begon als een
aanmeldingsfilm voor de Nederlandse filmacademie maar evolueerde in een
serieuze gooi naar een korte film door gevestigde namen te casten in de
Nederlandse film wereld zoals Manuel Broekman en Kees Boot. Ik heb het gehele
budget ook gecrowdfund en contacteerde sponsoren voor de hardware en
post-productie zoals Avi-Drome (post-productie bedrijf welke producties maakt
zoals The Voice en verschillende Nederlandse speelfilms zoals Simon) en TEAM
ENG (facilitair bedrijf welke high-end opname hardware uitleent).<br/>

My first short film called Limbo the Movie (Limbo de film) started as an
appliance film for the Dutch film academy (Nederlandse Filmacademie) but
evolved in a serious short film attempt by casting established names in the
dutch film industry for cast and crew like Manuel Broekman and Kees Boot. I
crowdfunded the total budget of the movie and contacted sponsors for hardware
and post-production facilities like Avi-Drome (post-production company
delivering audiovisual productions like The Voice and several dutch features)
and TEAM ENG (company delivering high-end video materials for shooting). <br/><br/></i><p></p>

dream.

Mijn naam is Frank Maters, ik ben 22 jaar en woon in Hilversum. Het is mijn
grote droom om een professioneel film regisseur te worden en ben erg blij dat
ik ben toegelaten tot de New York Film Academy voor de studie 'Bachelor of Fine
Arts in Filmmaking'. Ik heb de wil, de creativiteit en de kracht om dit te
bereiken. Er mist alleen nog een groot onderdeel.. geld.
ENGLISH_
My name is Frank Maters, I am 22 years old and living in Hilversum, NL. It's my
dream to become a skilled movie director and am very happy to be accepted at the
New York Film Academy in Los Angeles for the study 'Bachelor of Fine Arts in
FIlmmaking'. I have the will, the creativity and the power to achieve this. The
only big thing I am lacking... money.Hoe werkt het?
Om de crowdfunding campagne te laten slagen en het zo duidelijk mogelijk te
maken heb ik de volgende constructie bedacht. Bedrijven kunnen mij helpen door
te doneren met een minimum van 2.500 euro. In ruil
hiervoor krijgt u een promotionele bedrijfsvideo gemaakt door mij (Frank). Dit
houdt in dat ik een dag langs kom om te filmen en interviews af te nemen en
twee montage revisies. Mocht u geïnteresseerd zijn om meer te krijgen (meer
opnamedagen, meer montage revisies of een grotere productie waarde) dan is dat
altijd mogelijk, ik maak graag een offerte op maat gericht op specifieke wensen. Er zijn drie verschillende
levels waarbij de eerste het algemene Indiegogo doel is. Als dit doel wordt
gehaald zal het geld worden opgehaald en aan mij worden uitbetaald. Het
uiteindelijke doel is om het laatste level te bereiken, wat level 3 is, zodat
ik drie jaar kan studeren en mijn Bachelor of Fine Arts in Filmmaking kan gaan
halen aan de NYFA in Los Angeles.· 
LEVEL 1  -
  50.000 EURO      -  1 JAAR STUDEREN· 
LEVEL 2 
-   100.000 EURO   -  2 JAREN STUDEREN· 
LEVEL 3 
-   150.000 EURO   -  3 JAREN STUDEREN
ENGLISH_
How does it work?
For the crowdfunding to be successful and perfectly clear I came up with
the following construction. Companies can help me by pledging a minimum
of 2.500 euros. In exchange I will personally visit your
business (for one day) and make a promotional video plus two edit
revisions. If you would like more (days, revisions or bigger production value)
it is possible to receive a customized proposition. There are three tiers
where the first one will be the Indiegogo goal. If this goal is met the money
will be collected from you (one of the investors) and transferred to me. The
main goal is to reach the final tier, which is tier 3 for the three year long
study BFA in Filmmaking at the NYFA in Los Angeles.·

    Risks & Challenges It takes a lot to put on a show. But I have help and I know people with skills in the biz! You know who you are :) So it will be a challenge, but a challenge I know we can meet if we are able to get our fundraising goal.
    Other Ways You Can Help You may want to contribute in other ways and that is great. Local Artist Lindsey McElroy contributed with her wonderful art for the Drag Managerie (lindseyymc@yahoo.com, Insta: Lindseyyjoan). We also need actors, stage hands, makeup artists, costume magicians, lighting folks, etc. and most of all: We need your help to spread the word about the campaign AND also the show so we can sell those tickets!

<h2>About Leanides V2R Lab Station </h2>
<p>The Leanides V2R Lab Station is a project that I first thought of when I was thinking about  how I wish I could bring my GNS3 Cisco network labs into the real world. When I had studied the Cisco CCNA and CCNP courses, the virtual GNS3 labs that I did stayed in GNS3 and I would go to Uni and do labs with real Cisco devices and the two would never meet. What if I could save my GNS3 labs and roll them out to a real Cisco network lab on real devices? If I could do that I could work at home on the virtual GNS3 lab Sim and then roll out the lab at Uni on real Cisco devices and then save them and put them back onto GNS3 again at night.</p>
<p>To be able to do this would be amazing and free up a lot of time. I am pleased to announce that it is now finally possible and the software to do this is now available for anyone to use. </p>
<p>I believe that the ability to do this will make doing Cisco network labs a lot more fun and productive and I hope that the Leanides V2R Lab Station will be a useful tool that will help you right through your course of study with Cisco Labs.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1562820585/mbaqjvzi8nbxok2etlfk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2>Why do I need it?</h2>
</div><div>
<p>After doing many Cisco Labs and setting up countless Cisco devices in the workplace from scratch, I could see the need for a tool that would be able to quickly roll out network configurations to Cisco devices. The idea of a multi-purpose tool that could be of use at all levels of Cisco study evolved with time and the purpose was to develop something that is both useful and easy to use. One problem that has always persisted in the industry, is how to take a text file config and roll it out to a Cisco device. Anybody in the industry could relate to that challenge and I have worked on developing a faster and easier way than any of the alternatives that currently exist for deploying a config to a Cisco device. The product available with this  campaign is the culmination of that effort and I would like to see people get the benefits that it provides and also to see a community of people that can help to contribute suggestions and feedback that can ensure its continued development.</p>
<h2>What it Does</h2>
<p><strong>The Leanides V2R Lab Station solves several problems and empowers the user with a higher level of functionality.</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Transfer Configs from GNS3 to Real Cisco devices - </strong>It enables the user to transfer their Virtual GNS3 Cisco device configs to Real devices easily and also transfer the configs back from Real devices to Virtual GNS3 Lab devices.</p>
<p><strong>2. A Repository for Cisco Lab Configs - </strong>It allows you to collect your Cisco Lab configs from GNS3 and Real device configs in the one place and be able to edit and deploy them easily.It also allows for easy revision by making re-deployment of past labs a breeze.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Reliable Backups </strong>- It ensures that your Virtual GNS3 Lab configs are able to be saved reliably on a separate platform to GNS3 (in cases where GNS3 does not reliably save your configs).</p>
<p><strong>4. From text file to Device - </strong>It provides a fast and easy way to upload and transfer a text file config to a Cisco device.</p>
<p><strong>5. Rapid Network Deployment - </strong>It enables several configs to be transferred to several devices at once, which speeds up the time that it takes to setup a Lab. eg. It would enable you to prepare multiple devices in a Lab environment for deployment by pushing configs to their startup config via telnet from the Lab Station GUI.</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> <strong>Rollback Capability for Cisco Devices</strong> - The V2R Lab station has rollback functions that allow saved configs to be rolled back to the running or startup configs of Cisco devices. This capability is not inherent with Cisco Routers and Switches and has now been made possible.</p>
<p><strong>7.</strong> <strong>Store and Re-use your Network Change Scripts</strong> - Easy storage and access to change scripts. It allow you to store over 1000 macro scripts for changes to device configurations and provides a way to easily deploy them directly to Cisco devices.</p>
<h3>Transfer Virtual Labs to Real Cisco devices</h3>
<p>Transfer your Cisco configs from virtual labs in GNS3 to Real Cisco devices on either running or startup config or from real devices to GNS3 virtual labs.</p>
<h3>Automated Device Discovery  </h3>
<p>Fast and Easy to use Network Device Discovery - It can automatically locate your Cisco lab devices and load them into its settings.</p>
<div><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/NSH_fCaLMpM?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div></div>
<p> </p>
<h3>Backup Configs - A Complete store house of all your Labs</h3>
<p>Backup and Load Cisco configs on GNS3 or real devices as retrievable labs - you can either load a saved lab or upload configs and save them into a lab.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/MrgFZwHkekE?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<h3>Deploy Configs - Zero Provisioning to Startup Config</h3>
<p>Startup Configs can be rapidly deployed directly to Cisco devices on GNS3 Virtual or Real device Labs. You can load any saved config to any device quickly and easily.</p>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/kfMh45uKkk4?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<h3>Upload Text File Configs and Push them to Cisco Devices </h3>
<p>In the development of the Lab Station I have created a fast and easy way to push a text file config to a Cisco device. The goal was to be able to push any config to any selected device.

Move Your Cisco Configs from Virtual to Real Devices or from Real Devices to Virtual

 

 
About Leanides V2R Lab Station 
The Leanides V2R Lab Station is a project that I first thought of when I was thinking about  how I wish I could bring my GNS3 Cisco network labs into the real world. When I had studied the Cisco CCNA and CCNP courses, the virtual GNS3 labs that I did stayed in GNS3 and I would go to Uni and do labs with real Cisco devices and the two would never meet. What if I could save my GNS3 labs and roll them out to a real Cisco network lab on real devices? If I could do that I could work at home on the virtual GNS3 lab Sim and then roll out the lab at Uni on real Cisco devices and then save them and put them back onto GNS3 again at night.
To be able to do this would be amazing and free up a lot of time. I am pleased to announce that it is now finally possible and the software to do this is now available for anyone to use. 
I believe that the ability to do this will make doing Cisco network labs a lot more fun and productive and I hope that the Leanides V2R Lab Station will be a useful tool that will help you right through your course of study with Cisco Labs.

Why do I need it?

After doing many Cisco Labs and setting up countless Cisco devices in the workplace from scratch, I could see the need for a tool that would be able to quickly roll out network configurations to Cisco devices. The idea of a multi-purpose tool that could be of use at all levels of Cisco study evolved with time and the purpose was to develop something that is both useful and easy to use. One problem that has always persisted in the industry, is how to take a text file config and roll it out to a Cisco device. Anybody in the industry could relate to that challenge and I have worked on developing a faster and easier way than any of the alternatives that currently exist for deploying a config to a Cisco device. The product available with this  campaign is the culmination of that effort and I would like to see people get the benefits that it provides and also to see a community of people that can help to contribute suggestions and feedback that can ensure its continued development.
What it Does
The Leanides V2R Lab Station solves several problems and empowers the user with a higher level of functionality.
1. Transfer Configs from GNS3 to Real Cisco devices - It enables the user to transfer their Virtual GNS3 Cisco device configs to Real devices easily and also transfer the configs back from Real devices to Virtual GNS3 Lab devices.
2. A Repository for Cisco Lab Configs - It allows you to collect your Cisco Lab configs from GNS3 and Real device configs in the one place and be able to edit and deploy them easily.It also allows for easy revision by making re-deployment of past labs a breeze.
3. Reliable Backups - It ensures that your Virtual GNS3 Lab configs are able to be saved reliably on a separate platform to GNS3 (in cases where GNS3 does not reliably save your configs).
4. From text file to Device - It provides a fast and easy way to upload and transfer a text file config to a Cisco device.
5. Rapid Network Deployment - It enables several configs to be transferred to several devices at once, which speeds up the time that it takes to setup a Lab. eg. It would enable you to prepare multiple devices in a Lab environment for deployment by pushing configs to their startup config via telnet from the Lab Station GUI.
6. Rollback Capability for Cisco Devices - The V2R Lab station has rollback functions that allow saved configs to be rolled back to the running or startup configs of Cisco devices. This capability is not inherent with Cisco Routers and Switches and has now been made possible.
7. Store and Re-use your Network Change Scripts - Easy storage and access to change scripts. It allow you to store over 1000 macro scripts for changes to device configurations and provides a way to easily deploy them directly to Cisco devices.
Transfer Virtual Labs to Real Cisco devices
Transfer your Cisco configs from virtual labs in GNS3 to Real Cisco devices on either running or startup config or from real devices to GNS3 virtual labs.
Automated Device Discovery  
Fast and Easy to use Network Device Discovery - It can automatically locate your Cisco lab devices and load them into its settings.

 
Backup Configs - A Complete store house of all your Labs
Backup and Load Cisco configs on GNS3 or real devices as retrievable labs - you can either load a saved lab or upload configs and save them into a lab.

Deploy Configs - Zero Provisioning to Startup Config
Startup Configs can be rapidly deployed directly to Cisco devices on GNS3 Virtual or Real device Labs. You can load any saved config to any device quickly and easily.

Upload Text File Configs and Push them to Cisco Devices 
In the development of the Lab Station I have created a fast and easy way to push a text file config to a Cisco device. The goal was to be able to push any config to any selected device. You can upload the configs to the Lab Station and push them directly to the startup config of any selected Cisco device in a lab setting.
Easily Retrieve and Edit saved Labs
The configs of all your labs are easy to find or edit  and are ready to be deployed whenever you need.

 
Rollback Capability
The rollback functions allow you to simply rollback your Cisco devices to previously saved configs whenever you choose. You can rollback your configs to either the running or startup config of a GNS3 virtual device or on a Real Cisco device.
Rapid Revision Capability
Complete storage and easy review and re-use of all the commands and scripts that you run on Cisco devices for all the labs you do.
Outputs of User mode show commands are automatically saved and you can enter and keep commonly used show commands for quick and easy retrieval.
Macros - Save and run any config change scripts as macros for easy access and use. You can store thousands of configuration change scripts for use on Cisco devices.
USB Export/Import Capability 
Export/Import saved Lab configs, macro scripts and show commands used in doing Cisco labs. Keep them for re-use or share them with others to compare your labs.

<p>Who is Amin?</p>
<p>As a Palestinian from Gaza, things have never been easy from securing food to water to pursuing education.  Hard work in hopes of achieving one’s dreams keeps us going. We live on hope. It is in our blood. Years ago, I challenged my circumstances.  I aimed to pursue my dream of becoming a doctor. I earned the highest scores in high school and successfully joinedKyrgyz-Russian Slavic University. I am currently a 4th-year medical student there but the financial support of my family, is no longer available. Now, the completion of my studies depends on your support and I have hope that you, people out there, will be able to help me.</p>
<p>I am a refugee who lived in one of the poorest camps in Gaza Strip called the Bureij camp. My father is a builder who works for 12+ hours to earn 10$ a day. We are a family of 14 and his salary barely covers the basic needs of our life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Despite these difficulties, my parents always encouraged me to study hard to secure a better future. They see me as their hope, the future doctor who is going to help everyone in need. They always said “Your education is what will provide you with a good life, and help you earn good money. Education is your way to serve both your family and your community”. My family worked so hard to create a nurturing environment that enabled me to excel in my high school and the past years of college.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why medicine? And How will I give back to Gaza?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The reason I chose medicine is that I want to help as many people possible in Gaza. Being a doctor is a sacred mission that I have dedicated myself to. I have taken it upon myself to make the difference I want to see in Gaza. I want to open the path for people after me to fulfill their dreams and complete their education successfully to give back to their community. I want to help put an ending to the suffering of many innocent people in Gaza by filling the shortage of the medical workforce to save more lives.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Why am I raising funds?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My home city has always been subjected to wars and conflicts. I lived through very hard times with my family. While I am in Kyrgyzstan for college, my family is still living my family is still living in Gaza's very rough conditions. They are unable to support my studies anymore.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>My father used to work day and night to support my family in addition to covering my living expenses, transportation, and tuition. Moreover, my sister used to send me almost all her salary to help me continue my studies. However, she lost her job due to the current situation in the Gaza Strip. The prior pushed my father to borrow money, but now they don’t have any source of income.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I am now in a position where I can either go home with almost no chance of a better future or continue my dream with your generous help. And that is why my future and the future of all the people I can help with my degree is in your the hands now. The only way I will be able to continue my studies is through your donation.   </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Education is the best kind of investment because you are investing in people. People will then invest in other people. This cycle elevates communities and helps them flourish which ensures better living conditions for its people. And that is what I want for Palestine and its people.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Your donation will not only be a financial relief but a psychological one as well. It’ll enable me to focus on my studies and improve my scores. That will help me excel and serve my country. I will be eternally grateful to each contribution you make!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>What the money will be used for?</p>
<p>Tuition for the last two years, for visa registration and living fees.</p>

<p>La Red Financiera Solidaridad es una plataforma tecnológica que usando
redes sociales permitirá que los 350 millones de pobres de Latinoamérica salgan
de la pobreza con su esfuerzo emprendedor.  P<span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">ara lograrlo la Red Financiera proveerá: un
mercado de nano-valores para financiar los micro-emprendimientos, asesoría en
los modelos de negocio, tecnología operativa y de control, negociaciones por
volumen tanto para la compra como para la venta.  </span></p>
<p>El poder materializar los sueños permite enfrentar a la pobreza y
vencerla.  Un día de 1970, mientras vivía
en el sector rural, jugaba con mis hermanas a describir que íbamos a ser cuando crezcamos.
Cuando llegó mi turno dije:  voy a
estudiar mucho para ganarme una beca, estudiar un postgrado, hacerme
científico, luego empresario, llevar a pasear a mi mamá por el mundo, ayudar a
mis hermanos y hacer empresas que ayuden a la gente a salir de la pobreza.  Hoy, un día del 2015, tengo un doctorado en
Física de Estado Sólido, he dado la vuelta al mundo como científico, empresario y motivador de cambio familiar, he llevado a pasear a mi madre alrededor del mundo, he ayudado a
mis hermanos y sobrinos a obtener un título universitario y he permitido que miles
de familias tengan un trabajo digno en cinco países diferentes de
Latinoamérica.  Para completar mis
sueños, desde hace dos años estoy trabajando en la construcción de la primera
Red Financiera Solidaria del mundo que permitirá que los 350 millones de pobres
de Latinoamérica creen sus propias empresas y venzan a la pobreza sin recibir
limosna y usando las reglas del mercado. </p>
<p><b>Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Necesitamos acelerar la construcción de
     la primera Red Financiera Solidaria para lo cual se requiere un capital adicional
     de 500 mil dólares.  Este dinero se
     invertirá en cuatro rubros principales: 1.- 150 mil dólares para completar
     la construcción del sistema informático que opera la Red Financiera
     Solidaria Los Mosqueteros a nivel Latinoamericano, 2.- 250 mil dólares
     para compra una licencia financiera que permita operar en el mercado de
     valores  3.- 50 mil dólares para
     contratar con universidades locales la identificación de oportunidades de negocio que cumplan dos características principales: se beneficien de grandes volúmenes y necesiten alta dispersión de
     puntos de venta, y 4.-  50 mil
     dólares para invertir en mercadeo y publicidad en redes sociales.</li>
<li>Los contribuyentes recibirán
     reconocimiento público en el muro de patrocinadores del sitio
     <a href=""http://www.losmosqueteros.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.losmosqueteros.com</a>.  Este es un
     muro virtual donde inscribiremos los nombres y apellidos de cada una de
     las personas que contribuyan en este proyecto.  Adicionalmente, a las personas que
     contribuyan más de 50 dólares les enviaremos por correo una camiseta
     exclusiva de Los Mosqueteros.  Para
     las personas que aporten más de 100 dólares les enviaremos una gorra de diseño original con
     el logo de la Red Financiera Solidaria Los Mosqueteros con la inscripción “Juntos
     Venceremos”. Los contribuyentes que aporten más de mil dólares recibirán un juego de ajedrez fabricado de marfil vegetal (tagua) con los logos y frases de Los Mosqueteros.</li>
<li>Algo que he aprendido en el
     desarrollo de negocios alrededor del mundo es: si la propuesta es buena,
     hay que seguir insistiendo hasta que el mercado objetivo la adopte.  Los recursos que recibamos serán
     utilizados para desarrollar cada uno de los frentes en forma
     proporcional.  De cada dólar
     recibido 30 centavos serán utilizados para continuar construyendo el
     software, 50 centavos se destinarán a la compra de la licencia financiera,
     10 centavos se destinarán a investigación y 10 centavos a mercadeo y
     publicidad.  Este es un proyecto que
     debe perdurar, por lo tanto, lo construiremos una piedra sobre otra para
     que sea sólido.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>El impacto</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Latinoamérica tiene una
     población de 550 millones de habitantes de los cuales el 70% son pobres-
     350 millones de pobres.  Los
     organismos políticos locales y mundiales gastan miles de millones de
     dólares cada año en campañas que mal educan a los Latinoamericanos.  Estas campañas consideran a los pobres
     inútiles e incapaces para salir por sus propios medios de la pobreza y los
     acostumbran a recibir limosnas.  La
     experiencia de miles de Latinoamericanos que hemos salido de la pobreza es
     que para salir de ella hay que hacer emprendimientos que reúnan tres
     condiciones: 1. Que sean oportunidades que respondan a necesidades de la
     mayoría- comida, medicina, mecánica, agricultura 2. Que los negocios sean
     escalables para obtener beneficios de volumen y agrupación 3. Que sean
     fáciles de entender para que los 210 millones de usuarios de las redes
     sociales puedan ser accionistas de esos negocios aportando pequeñas
     cantidades de dinero- nanoinversiones. </li>
<li>Cada dólar que Usted aporte
     será utilizado para crear la infraestructura tecnológica y de conocimiento
     que permita guiar a los 350 millones de pobres de Latinoamericanos en la
     creación de sus propias empresas. 
     Las personas que, con esfuerzo y trabajo honrado, hemos logrado
     alejar la pobreza de nuestras vidas, tenemos que unir esfuerzos para
     ayudar a los demás a salir de la lista de pobres. Unos pocos dólares
     servirán para que le enseñemos al mundo que “Juntos Venceremos” a la
     pobreza. </li>
<li>La Red Financiera Solidaria
     Los Mosqueteros se ha estado construyendo desde hace dos años.  Se hizo el lanzamiento del sitio web el
     20 de marzo de 2015 con un primer producto- subastas de media móvil.  El objetivo de este producto es educar a
     los miembros en el concepto de solidaridad y ahorro. Muchos estudiantes universitarios han logrado comprar laptops pagando un 30% del valor de mercado, la diferencia fue pagada por los otros participantes. En la actualidad, el sitio  tiene 5 mil usuarios y el número de registrados crece a una tasa del 5%
     semanal.  En el mes de Octubre  saldremos con dos productos solidarios más: contribuciones y regalos.  Las contribuciones son pequeños
     préstamos que los contactos en las redes sociales hacen a cada
     miembro.  Estos préstamos no cobran

<p><b>Brief review</b></p>
<p>The
Solidarity Financial Network is a technology platform that using social
networks and the great penetration of information technology will permit the 350
million poor in Latin America getting out of poverty using their entrepreneurial
efforts.  To achieve this goal, the
network will provide: an electronic nano-securities market to finance the
startups, advice on business models, operational and business control
technology and volume negotiations for both purchase and sales.</p>
<p>The power
to make dreams come true help to overcome poverty. One day in 1970, while
living in the countryside, playing with my sisters to describe what we were
going to be when we grow up, I said:  I
will study hard to earn a scholarship to study graduate school abroad to become
a scientist, that will help me to become an entrepreneur, to take my mom around
the world, to help my brothers and sisters to get a career, and to build companies to help
people get out of poverty. Today, one day in 2015, I have a PhD in Solid State
Physics, I've been around the world as a scientist, entrepreneur, and as a
motivator for family success, I have taken my mother around the world, I have
helped my brothers and nephews to get university carrers and have helped
thousands of families to have well paid jobs in five different Latin American
countries. To complete my dreams, for the last two years I have been working on
the construction of the first Solidarity Financial Network in the world that
will allow the 350 million poor people in Latin America to create their own
businesses and overcome poverty without receiving compassion money and competing with the market rules .</p>
<p><b>What we need and what you get</b></p>
<p>• We need
to accelerate the construction of the first Solidarity Financial Network for
which an additional sum of $ 500,000 is required. This money will be invested
in four main areas: 1. $ 150,000 to complete construction of the sotware that
operates the Solidarity Financial Network “The Musketeers”, 2. $ 250,000 to
purchase a financial license to operate the nano-securities,  3. $ 50,000 to contract local universities to
identify business opportunities in each country that benefit from high volumes
and high dispersion of outlets, and 4. $ 50,000 to invest in marketing and
advertising in social networks.</p>
<p>• Contributors
will receive public recognition at the cyber memorial wall  in the <a href=""http://www.losmosqueteros.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.losmosqueteros.com</a> site. This is a
virtual wall where contributors names will be engraved.  Additionally, people who contribute more than
$ 50 we receive an exclusive T-shirt of the The Musketeers.  For people who contribute more than $ 100 will
send a cap with the logo of the Solidarity Financial Network the Musketeers
with the inscription ""Together We Shall Overcome.""  Contributors of more than one thousand
dollars will get a Tagua ( Vegetable Ivory) Chess Game decorated with The
Musketeers logos and phrases.</p>
<p>• One thing
I've learned in business development around the world is: if the proposal is
good, you must continue to insist until the target market adopts it. The funds
received will be used to develop each of the activities in proportion. Of every
dollar received 30 cents will be used to continue building the software, 50
cents will go towards the purchase of financial license, 10 cents will go to
research and 10 cents to marketing and advertising. This is a project that
should last, therefore it will build a stone upon another to make it solid.</p>
<p><b>The Impact</b></p>
<p>• Latin
America has a population of 550 million people of whom 70% are poor- 350
million poor. Local and global political organizations spend billions of
dollars each year in campaigns that mal-educate the Latin American poor. These
campaigns consider the poor unwilling, weak and incapable of overcoming
poverty. The experience of thousands of Latin Americans who have moved out of
poverty will be used to help others. 
Their experience will be used to help people finding business
opportunities in areas that have three concurrent characteristics: 1. Businesses
related to food, medicine, engineering,  and agriculture 2. The different opportunities
can be grouped to reach big volumes.  3. The
business models are easy to explain to the 210 million users of social networks
who can become shareholders of those businesses providing small amounts of
money-  we call a dollar investment a nano-
investments.</p>
<p>• Every
dollar you contribute will be used to create the technological infrastructure
and knowledge to lead the 350 million poor in Latin America in creating their
own businesses. People who, with effort and honest work, have succeeded in getting
out of poverty, must join efforts to help others out of the list of poor. A few
dollars that will be used to teach the world that ""Together We Shall
Overcome"" poverty.</p>
<p>• The Solidarity
Financial Network “The Musketeers” has been building for two years. The website
 <a href=""http://www.losmosquetteros.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.losmosqueteros.com</a> was launched on March 20, 2015 with a first product: mobile media auctions.
The purpose of this product is to educate members on the concept of solidarity
and savings. Using this product several University students have been able to buy their laptops paying 30% of the market value.  The difference was paid by the other members.  The site currently has 5000 users and the number of registered is growing
at a rate of 5% per week. In October, two more products will be incorporated:
contributions and gifts. Contributions are small loans that the contacts on the
social networks make to each other member. These loans do not charge interest and must
be returned when the person who gave the help requests.  The Gift product is a mechanism to help
members on emergency situations: unexpected funeral, serious illness, school
enrollment, marriage. These are not reimbursable grants but the recipients must contribute
to others if  they wish for applying again for a gift in the future. These products serve to teach
members the benefits of solidarity. The second phase of the project is the roll
out of the startup financing with nano-investments. We will finish this stage
by mid-2016 and we are confident that your name will be engraved on the cyber wall
of the Musketeers so that together we will beat poverty.</p>
<p><b>Risks and Challenges</b></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">Solidarity
is a deeply rooted social value in Latin American but it is only used locally.
We intend to teach the 350 million poor in the region that the solidarity
linked to social networks and creativity for business will give us the
opportunity to get out of poverty by helping one another. The main danger in
this model is that beneficiaries do not understand and do not use the platform.
Another danger is that the of we ran out money and do not get to the number of
users that maintains the network operating. Obviously there are operational and
technological hazards that are controlled by the company team.</span></p>
<p>The risk of
not arousing interest in potential users is reduced if the target market is
well chosen to plant the concept. The Solidarity Financial Network target
market focuses on men and women aged 18 to 35 who use social networks. This
gives us a potential of 150 million users in the region. Additionally, this
target market is the group of people with the largest unemployment rate.  They are eager to star their own business as
a way of generating some income, but they do not have enough money and
expertise.</p>
<p>Every
enterprise is limited by the time it takes to reach an adequate size and the
amount of money that it has to do it. Completion of the network software and
buying of a financial license are the two tasks that will accelerate the growth
of the network. With your support we expect to complete these tasks within a
year. We
believe that the Solidarity Financial Network will change the distribution
of wealth in Latin America, and we will build it.</p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p>
<p>• Any help
that you can do to support the construction of the first Solidarity Financial
Network will be well received. If you wish to support this initiative with
contributions different from money, we will accept it with pleasure. We need
expertise in all fields of administration, science, and technology to help with
project evaluations. If you have advertising money left on social networks, we
can used it to position the network. In short, our network can make good use of
all the resources that you may offer us.</p>
<p>• The
simplest way to help our campaign is to share our proposal to your contacts on
social networks. It will be much easier if you do it using the sharing tools provided
by Indiegogo.</p>
<p>• Remember,
together we will defeat poverty by teaching people to be supportive and to
compete fairly.</p>

Breve reseña
La Red Financiera Solidaridad es una plataforma tecnológica que usando
redes sociales permitirá que los 350 millones de pobres de Latinoamérica salgan
de la pobreza con su esfuerzo emprendedor.  Para lograrlo la Red Financiera proveerá: un
mercado de nano-valores para financiar los micro-emprendimientos, asesoría en
los modelos de negocio, tecnología operativa y de control, negociaciones por
volumen tanto para la compra como para la venta.  
El poder materializar los sueños permite enfrentar a la pobreza y
vencerla.  Un día de 1970, mientras vivía
en el sector rural, jugaba con mis hermanas a describir que íbamos a ser cuando crezcamos.
Cuando llegó mi turno dije:  voy a
estudiar mucho para ganarme una beca, estudiar un postgrado, hacerme
científico, luego empresario, llevar a pasear a mi mamá por el mundo, ayudar a
mis hermanos y hacer empresas que ayuden a la gente a salir de la pobreza.  Hoy, un día del 2015, tengo un doctorado en
Física de Estado Sólido, he dado la vuelta al mundo como científico, empresario y motivador de cambio familiar, he llevado a pasear a mi madre alrededor del mundo, he ayudado a
mis hermanos y sobrinos a obtener un título universitario y he permitido que miles
de familias tengan un trabajo digno en cinco países diferentes de
Latinoamérica.  Para completar mis
sueños, desde hace dos años estoy trabajando en la construcción de la primera
Red Financiera Solidaria del mundo que permitirá que los 350 millones de pobres
de Latinoamérica creen sus propias empresas y venzan a la pobreza sin recibir
limosna y usando las reglas del mercado. 
Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes

Necesitamos acelerar la construcción de
     la primera Red Financiera Solidaria para lo cual se requiere un capital adicional
     de 500 mil dólares.  Este dinero se
     invertirá en cuatro rubros principales: 1.- 150 mil dólares para completar
     la construcción del sistema informático que opera la Red Financiera
     Solidaria Los Mosqueteros a nivel Latinoamericano, 2.- 250 mil dólares
     para compra una licencia financiera que permita operar en el mercado de
     valores  3.- 50 mil dólares para
     contratar con universidades locales la identificación de oportunidades de negocio que cumplan dos características principales: se beneficien de grandes volúmenes y necesiten alta dispersión de
     puntos de venta, y 4.-  50 mil
     dólares para invertir en mercadeo y publicidad en redes sociales.
Los contribuyentes recibirán
     reconocimiento público en el muro de patrocinadores del sitio
     www.losmosqueteros.com.  Este es un
     muro virtual donde inscribiremos los nombres y apellidos de cada una de
     las personas que contribuyan en este proyecto.  Adicionalmente, a las personas que
     contribuyan más de 50 dólares les enviaremos por correo una camiseta
     exclusiva de Los Mosqueteros.  Para
     las personas que aporten más de 100 dólares les enviaremos una gorra de diseño original con
     el logo de la Red Financiera Solidaria Los Mosqueteros con la inscripción “Juntos
     Venceremos”. Los contribuyentes que aporten más de mil dólares recibirán un juego de ajedrez fabricado de marfil vegetal (tagua) con los logos y frases de Los Mosqueteros.
Algo que he aprendido en el
     desarrollo de negocios alrededor del mundo es: si la propuesta es buena,
     hay que seguir insistiendo hasta que el mercado objetivo la adopte.  Los recursos que recibamos serán
     utilizados para desarrollar cada uno de los frentes en forma
     proporcional.  De cada dólar
     recibido 30 centavos serán utilizados para continuar construyendo el
     software, 50 centavos se destinarán a la compra de la licencia financiera,
     10 centavos se destinarán a investigación y 10 centavos a mercadeo y
     publicidad.  Este es un proyecto que
     debe perdurar, por lo tanto, lo construiremos una piedra sobre otra para
     que sea sólido.

El impacto

Latinoamérica tiene una
     población de 550 millones de habitantes de los cuales el 70% son pobres-
     350 millones de pobres.  Los
     organismos políticos locales y mundiales gastan miles de millones de
     dólares cada año en campañas que mal educan a los Latinoamericanos.  Estas campañas consideran a los pobres
     inútiles e incapaces para salir por sus propios medios de la pobreza y los
     acostumbran a recibir limosnas.  La
     experiencia de miles de Latinoamericanos que hemos salido de la pobreza es
     que para salir de ella hay que hacer emprendimientos que reúnan tres
     condiciones: 1. Que sean oportunidades que respondan a necesidades de la
     mayoría- comida, medicina, mecánica, agricultura 2. Que los negocios sean
     escalables para obtener beneficios de volumen y agrupación 3. Que sean
     fáciles de entender para que los 210 millones de usuarios de las redes
     sociales puedan ser accionistas de esos negocios aportando pequeñas
     cantidades de dinero- nanoinversiones. 
Cada dólar que Usted aporte
     será utilizado para crear la infraestructura tecnológica y de conocimiento
     que permita guiar a los 350 millones de pobres de Latinoamericanos en la
     creación de sus propias empresas. 
     Las personas que, con esfuerzo y trabajo honrado, hemos logrado
     alejar la pobreza de nuestras vidas, tenemos que unir esfuerzos para
     ayudar a los demás a salir de la lista de pobres. Unos pocos dólares
     servirán para que le enseñemos al mundo que “Juntos Venceremos” a la
     pobreza. 
La Red Financiera Solidaria
     Los Mosqueteros se ha estado construyendo desde hace dos años.  Se hizo el lanzamiento del sitio web el
     20 de marzo de 2015 con un primer producto- subastas de media móvil.  El objetivo de este producto es educar a
     los miembros en el concepto de solidaridad y ahorro. Muchos estudiantes universitarios han logrado comprar laptops pagando un 30% del valor de mercado, la diferencia fue pagada por los otros participantes. En la actualidad, el sitio  tiene 5 mil usuarios y el número de registrados crece a una tasa del 5%
     semanal.  En el mes de Octubre  saldremos con dos productos solidarios más: contribuciones y regalos.  Las contribuciones son pequeños
     préstamos que los contactos en las redes sociales hacen a cada
     miembro.  Estos préstamos no cobran
     interéses y se deben devolver cuando el que dió la ayuda lo solicite.
     También funcionará un mecanismo de ayuda para emergencias: entierro
     inesperado, enfermedad grave, matrícula escolar, matrimonio.  Estas serán ayudas no reembolsables pero
     el receptor deberá colaborar en otras solicitudes similares. Estos
     productos sirven para enseñar a los miembros las ventajas de la solidaridad.  La segunda fase del proyecto es el
     lanzamiento del modelo de financiamiento de negocios con apoyo financiero
     de los miembros de la red como nano-inversionistas.  Esta segunda etapa esperamos terminarla
     a mediados del 2016 y confiamos que su nombre esté inscrito en el muro de
     los Mosqueteros que vencimos a la pobreza.

<p>Kodi creates an environment for curiosity that is followed by a huge creativity boost in your child!

<p>Children learn most effectively through interactive conversations, and Kodi really is a smooth talker! It uses contingent responding, which means it actively listens, contributes relevant responses, and asks related questions. The vivid interactions supported by hi-tech solution lead to your kid’s vocabulary expanding and result in language acquisition.</p>

<p>Kodi was programmed with the assistance of an academic child psychologist who contributed their care for cognitive stages of child’s development. That’s why it adapts to your child’s age and provides appropriate activities for the preoperational reasoning stage, and other for the concrete operational stage. It means that younger kids get eg. memory games, alphabet, spelling and counting exercises, while the older ones get riddles, fun facts, and world, universe or historical maps etc.</p>

<p>Music is highly important in any child’s development and Kodi knows how to encourage children to play instruments, compose, rhyme, sing, and dance! Musical training develops areas of the brain that are related to language and reasoning, improves hand-eye coordination and motor skills, builds imagination, intellectual curiosity, and even spatial intelligence. But above all, musical skills are useful, fun, and who knows – maybe you’ll raise a future star?</p>

<p>The importance of learning foreign languages cannot be overestimated in today’s world. It’s not only about being a citizen of the world. Studying is a benefit in itself, resulting in better native language apprehension, an ear for music, and out of the box thinking. That’s why Kodi provides individual foreign language learning techniques adjusted to your kid’s age. Rest assured, all in all it’s way cheaper than any language school.</p>

<p>EI is the ability to be smart about feelings – both our own and those of other people. Kodi was developed with special care for expressing emotions so that it can teach to be mindful of the feelings of others, but also self-aware and self-confident. It will engage your child to responsibility, commitment and emotion recognition activities. It's absolutely crucial, in a world lacking of empathy, full of anonymous judges in social media, and where bullying behaviors are so common, to be emotionally responsible.</p>

It adjusts to every individual to empower their natural talents. Kodi analyzes the strongest and weakest assets by engaging the child in diverse activities and keeping statistics. It provides personalized education that will ensure your child’s sustainable development.</p>

<h2>KODI FOR PARENTS</h2>
<p>We are mothers and fathers ourselves, so we know from experience how challenging it is to raise a child. We also consulted a lot of other parents during the developing process. This is why Kodi is so perfectly tailored for the parents' needs and problems.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1543501718/pdp5i6u4tadnej4brut9.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Kodi will be your aid in some of the parenting responsibilities by making sure your kid follows their daily schedule and overseeing the repetitive activities. It can wake your child up on time and mind their morning or evening routine, such as dressing up, brushing their teeth, doing homework etc., and meanwhile, you can take care of your other duties. Kodi administers healthy daily habits of waking-up and bedtime, but also teaches responsibility and self-reliance.</p>

<p>You could call Kodi a parent’s peace of mind companion. It creates healthy environment for your child by controlling play duration and delivered content, and limiting passive entertainment. Kodi looks after your child 24/7 and if anything worrisome happens, it will alarm you immediately through an app. And remember – Kodi never sleeps, which makes it a reliable night watchman. So you can sleep peacefully, knowing that Kodi will call you if you're needed.</p>

<p>Kodi goes with a dedicated, clean and multifunctional application for iOS and Android that is paired with your robot. Via the app, you can take a look at your child through Kodi’s eyes and make sure everything is fine, or call them and talk anytime you want. The app provides you also with: a remote control over playtime and schedule following, access to statistics of activities and your child’s progress, as well as all the photos and videos made by Kodi, so that you won't miss any important achievements or funny situations!</p> <p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/9PyUz9sQLABwmsvvt6/giphy.gif"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/2zozWWF9kFPP2HSZL5/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Give your child a great creativity booster and learning inspirator!</h3>
<p>Creativity is the mental characteristic that allows us to think outside of the box, which results in taking an innovative approach to solving problems. It is believed that creativity is a crucial factor for success in the modern world. However, scientific evidence shows that if we don't exercise our imagination, we lose the ability to be creative. According to the research, we are born creative geniuses, and later many factors of the modern world - passive entertainment, video games, mass education or standardized testing - dumb us down.</p>
<h3>Protect imaginative treasure in your child!</h3>

<h2><strong>KODI FAQ</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Who is Kodi designed for?</strong></p>
<p>Kodi was made with kids aged 4-8 and their parents in mind, but we are sure that any child and adult will be entertained by this intelligent toy.</p> <p><strong>When will Kodi ship?</strong></p>
<p>We are planning to start shipping Kodi 6 months after the crowdfunding campaign is over.</p> <p><strong>Where does Kodi ship?</strong></p>
<p>All over the world! Wherever you live, Kodi will get delivered.</p> <p><strong>Does Kodi move?</strong></p>
<p>Kodi rotates its head and body, so that it can follow what is happening around it. However, it doesn’t have wheels or legs, so it can’t move from place to place on its own. Kodi isn't heavy, though – you or your child can easily pick it up and move any place you want.</p> <p><strong>What languages does Kodi speak?</strong></p>
<p>For now, Kodi is an English speaker. We are constantly developing its functionalities and working on adding more common languages.</p>
<p>Also Kodi can teach Spanish.</p> <p><strong>How to turn Kodi on for the first time?</strong></p>
<p>It’s super easy! When you take Kodi out of the box, all you need to do is connect it to electricity and push the “On” button.</p> <p><strong>Do I need a WiFi network for Kodi to work?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, Kodi connects with the app via WiFi.</p> <p><strong>How do I charge Kodi?</strong></p>
<p>Kodi has a battery that needs to be charged, just like a smartphone.</p> <p><strong>How easy is it to set up Kodi?</strong></p>
<p>You can set up Kodi through the dedicated app that comes with the robot. It’s very intuitive and easy to use.</p> <p><strong>Can I access Kodi remotely from outside of my house?</strong></p>
<p>Sure you can! Kodi is controlled via the mobile app, so you have access to its control panel anytime and anywhere.</p> <p><strong>Does the app work with iOS, Android and Windows mobile devices?</strong></p>
<p>The Kodi app is going to work on iOS and Android only.</p> <p><strong>Can I control Kodi with several smartphones?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, there are no limits for the number of smartphones that can control one Kodi.</p> <p><strong>Where can I download the app for Kodi?</strong></p>
<p>You can download the Kodi app by scanning the special QR code that is included in Kodi’s welcome package, but it will also be available in both App Store and Google Play.</p> <p><strong>What does the app do?</strong></p>
<p>The app allows you to control Kodi by establishing its daily routines, games schedule, and teaching cycles. It also gives you access to the statistics of activities, your child’s progress, and the videos or photos that Kodi made.</p> <p><strong>How long does the battery last?</strong></p>
<p>It depends on the usage, but approximately 4 hours. We are still working on extending battery life.</p> <p><strong>Does Kodi have an On/Off function?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, you can turn Kodi on/off whenever you need to.</p> <p><strong>Are any accessories necessary to use Kodi?</strong></p>
<p>No. Accessories that we offer are bonuses that can adjust its look or add new functionalities. But you don’t need them to use the Kodi’s classic version.</p> <p><strong>Is the software open source?</strong></p>
<p>No.</p> <p><strong>How secure is this?</strong></p>
<p>We've been developing Kodi for a few months, knowing that the kids safety issues are essential. From the materials used and a rounded shape, to designing games and displaying content, we wanted to be absolutely sure that this toy would be safe for your child.</p> <p><strong>How does Kodi store information?</strong></p>
<p>By using the concept of neural networks, Kodi learns new information and processes it to know more about its users. He is using the data to adjust its behaviour and functionalities to its users' expectations. It doesn't store any information about users.</p> <p><strong>How does Kodi respect my privacy?</strong></p>
<p>Kodi doesn't send any audio or video materials to the cloud. All data is processed inside the robot itself, so it's perfectly safe.</p> <p><strong>How much does it cost?</strong></p>
<p>We are still working on lowering production costs to establish optimum price. One thing is certain – it will never be cheaper than it is here!</p> <p><strong>Is the shipping cost included in the price of Kodi?</strong></p>
<p>We are still working on it. We encourage you to follow our updates to learn more.</p> <p><strong>If I have a question, how can I reach your team?</strong></p>

BENEFITS FROM KODI
With your your suggestions and feedback, we’ve made KODI perfectly tailored to your and your child’s needs. Take a look at KODI’s main features:


KODI CAN
KODI can do all those extraordinary things because it is equipped with hi-tech solutions.

KODI FOR KIDS
Kodi was created to provide sustainable cognitive development for children. It supports kids in many ways, activating both the left and the right cerebral hemisphere.

Kodi creates an environment for curiosity that is followed by a huge creativity boost in your child! It employs many imaginative thinking activities, such as: storytelling, ideation and associations games, creating mind maps, and many others. Remember – according to various studies, creativity is the most crucial factor for future success!


Children learn most effectively through interactive conversations, and Kodi really is a smooth talker! It uses contingent responding, which means it actively listens, contributes relevant responses, and asks related questions. The vivid interactions supported by hi-tech solution lead to your kid’s vocabulary expanding and result in language acquisition.


Kodi was programmed with the assistance of an academic child psychologist who contributed their care for cognitive stages of child’s development. That’s why it adapts to your child’s age and provides appropriate activities for the preoperational reasoning stage, and other for the concrete operational stage. It means that younger kids get eg. memory games, alphabet, spelling and counting exercises, while the older ones get riddles, fun facts, and world, universe or historical maps etc.


Music is highly important in any child’s development and Kodi knows how to encourage children to play instruments, compose, rhyme, sing, and dance! Musical training develops areas of the brain that are related to language and reasoning, improves hand-eye coordination and motor skills, builds imagination, intellectual curiosity, and even spatial intelligence. But above all, musical skills are useful, fun, and who knows – maybe you’ll raise a future star?


The importance of learning foreign languages cannot be overestimated in today’s world. It’s not only about being a citizen of the world. Studying is a benefit in itself, resulting in better native language apprehension, an ear for music, and out of the box thinking. That’s why Kodi provides individual foreign language learning techniques adjusted to your kid’s age. Rest assured, all in all it’s way cheaper than any language school.


EI is the ability to be smart about feelings – both our own and those of other people. Kodi was developed with special care for expressing emotions so that it can teach to be mindful of the feelings of others, but also self-aware and self-confident. It will engage your child to responsibility, commitment and emotion recognition activities. It's absolutely crucial, in a world lacking of empathy, full of anonymous judges in social media, and where bullying behaviors are so common, to be emotionally responsible.

Each child is different and has a unique spark of genius that Kodi won’t miss! It adjusts to every individual to empower their natural talents. Kodi analyzes the strongest and weakest assets by engaging the child in diverse activities and keeping statistics. It provides personalized education that will ensure your child’s sustainable development.

 
KODI FOR PARENTS
We are mothers and fathers ourselves, so we know from experience how challenging it is to raise a child. We also consulted a lot of other parents during the developing process. This is why Kodi is so perfectly tailored for the parents' needs and problems.

Kodi will be your aid in some of the parenting responsibilities by making sure your kid follows their daily schedule and overseeing the repetitive activities. It can wake your child up on time and mind their morning or evening routine, such as dressing up, brushing their teeth, doing homework etc., and meanwhile, you can take care of your other duties. Kodi administers healthy daily habits of waking-up and bedtime, but also teaches responsibility and self-reliance.


You could call Kodi a parent’s peace of mind companion. It creates healthy environment for your child by controlling play duration and delivered content, and limiting passive entertainment. Kodi looks after your child 24/7 and if anything worrisome happens, it will alarm you immediately through an app. And remember – Kodi never sleeps, which makes it a reliable night watchman. So you can sleep peacefully, knowing that Kodi will call you if you're needed.


Kodi goes with a dedicated, clean and multifunctional application for iOS and Android that is paired with your robot. Via the app, you can take a look at your child through Kodi’s eyes and make sure everything is fine, or call them and talk anytime you want. The app provides you also with: a remote control over playtime and schedule following, access to statistics of activities and your child’s progress, as well as all the photos and videos made by Kodi, so that you won't miss any important achievements or funny situations!

TEAM
Kodi has many parents but meet those the most dedicated.




 
How an idea turned into the Kodi your kids will play with...
We have already prepared and planned all the way to the mass production.
All we need is your support to make Kodi - AI powered robot available on the market to revolutionize children’s playtime and home education through the first truly responsive interactions. 


 
Give your child a great creativity booster and learning inspirator!
Creativity is the mental characteristic that allows us to think outside of the box, which results in taking an innovative approach to solving problems. It is believed that creativity is a crucial factor for success in the modern world. However, scientific evidence shows that if we don't exercise our imagination, we lose the ability to be creative. According to the research, we are born creative geniuses, and later many factors of the modern world - passive entertainment, video games, mass education or standardized testing - dumb us down.
Protect imaginative treasure in your child!

You can expect to see some tremendous intellectual, social, and emotional changes while your child will just have fun and good time with Kodi.

KODI FAQ
 
Who is Kodi designed for?
Kodi was made with kids aged 4-8 and their parents in mind, but we are sure that any child and adult will be entertained by this intelligent toy. When will Kodi ship?
We are planning to start shipping Kodi 6 months after the crowdfunding campaign is over. Where does Kodi ship?
All over the world! Wherever you live, Kodi will get delivered. Does Kodi move?
Kodi rotates its head and body, so that it can follow what is happening around it. However, it doesn’t have wheels or legs, so it can’t move from place to place on its own. Kodi isn't heavy, though – you or your child can easily pick it up and move any place you want. What languages does Kodi speak?
For now, Kodi is an English speaker. We are constantly developing its functionalities and working on adding more common languages.
Also Kodi can teach Spanish. How to turn Kodi on for the first time?
It’s super easy! When you take Kodi out of the box, all you need to do is connect it to electricity and push the “On” button. Do I need a WiFi network for Kodi to work?
Yes, Kodi connects with the app via WiFi. How do I charge Kodi?
Kodi has a battery that needs to be charged, just like a smartphone. How easy is it to set up Kodi?
You can set up Kodi through the dedicated app that comes with the robot. It’s very intuitive and easy to use. Can I access Kodi remotely from outside of my house?
Sure you can! Kodi is controlled via the mobile app, so you have access to its control panel anytime and anywhere. Does the app work with iOS, Android and Windows mobile devices?
The Kodi app is going to work on iOS and Android only. Can I control Kodi with several smartphones?
Yes, there are no limits for the number of smartphones that can control one Kodi. Where can I download the app for Kodi?
You can download the Kodi app by scanning the special QR code that is included in Kodi’s welcome package, but it will also be available in both App Store and Google Play. What does the app do?
The app allows you to control Kodi by establishing its daily routines, games schedule, and teaching cycles. It also gives you access to the statistics of activities, your child’s progress, and the videos or photos that Kodi made. How long does the battery last?
It depends on the usage, but approximately 4 hours. We are still working on extending battery life. Does Kodi have an On/Off function?
Yes, you can turn Kodi on/off whenever you need to. Are any accessories necessary to use Kodi?
No. Accessories that we offer are bonuses that can adjust its look or add new functionalities. But you don’t need them to use the Kodi’s classic version. Is the software open source?
No. How secure is this?
We've been developing Kodi for a few months, knowing that the kids safety issues are essential. From the materials used and a rounded shape, to designing games and displaying content, we wanted to be absolutely sure that this toy would be safe for your child. How does Kodi store information?
By using the concept of neural networks, Kodi learns new information and processes it to know more about its users. He is using the data to adjust its behaviour and functionalities to its users' expectations. It doesn't store any information about users. How does Kodi respect my privacy?
Kodi doesn't send any audio or video materials to the cloud. All data is processed inside the robot itself, so it's perfectly safe. How much does it cost?
We are still working on lowering production costs to establish optimum price. One thing is certain – it will never be cheaper than it is here! Is the shipping cost included in the price of Kodi?
We are still working on it. We encourage you to follow our updates to learn more. If I have a question, how can I reach your team?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Aloha IndieGoGo! We're here hoping for your support in getting our business
Food Bikes off the ground and running! We have a great team that are ready to
get you your food early in the morning when you need it.</p>
<p>Henry - He's the bike guy! With his mechanical experience and muscular legs,
he'll be in charge of keeping the bikes rolling as well as the speedy delivery
of food to wherever it needs to go.</p>
<p>Fiona - Yep she's the cook! From Indonesia and a cook at the Polynesian
Cultural Center she's very experienced with the fine arts of cooking. And shhh
here's a secret....the foods really good!</p>
<p>Wesley - Our tech guy! He's going to be working on developing an app and
website for our delivery service so you can sit in class and order! With his
brains you'll only get the best app service possible for your best convenience.</p>
<p>Now that introductions are over, let’s get down to the details of our
business. Our business, Food Bikes, will be providing breakfast food for
students in the early morning hours between 6-10am (remember when that was
early?) to help students eat a good breakfast when they don’t have time to make
food themselves. We’ll start off selling breakfast burritos and if all goes
good we’ll expand our menu to other delicious breakfast food. This business
includes something that means a lot to each of us as showed in the
introductions.</p>
<p>Your contributions will really be the funding for this business. All three
of us our college students studying Entrepreneurship and running our own
business would give us a huge advantage compared to many others in this day,
Along with that you get some delicious food!</p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Funding for this project will help cover our basic start-up
costs as well as costs for the first couple weeks. Our start-up costs are around
$300 with a large amount of that being the bicycle to transport and deliver the
food. Day to day costs would run just under $100 a day to feed 50 people. We’ll
start off using some of the cooking supplies we already have, but after making
some profit we’ll buy our own cooking utensils. We’re hoping to get this project
completely funded otherwise this won’t be a possibility at this moment.</p>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We all know breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but we always
skip it for one reason or another. That’s why Food Bikes is here. We help
people get a good breakfast in for a low price and no work besides putting in
an order with us. This helps students work better in class and focus better in
the mornings which of course makes for better doctors, accountants, writers,
you name it they’ll be better because they ate breakfast!</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Like every business we have our challenges. When funded we will work on
getting a food permit from the state as well as other food facility permits we’ll
need. Solving these should be rather simple, just a matter of getting paperwork
done and getting in touch with the right people.</p>
<p>Challenges will be faced head on as we all have a part in this business and
want to see it succeed the best it can.</p>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Can’t contribute? Share this with your friends! There’s some awesome share
tools on the left hand side of the page to share on your favorite social
networks! And of course we’re always open to comments and suggestions! Post any
of those above in the comments section and we’ll get back to you!</p>
<h3>Thank you for your support and contributions! </h3>

early?) to help students eat a good breakfast when they don’t have time to make
food themselves. We’ll start off selling breakfast burritos and if all goes
good we’ll expand our menu to other delicious breakfast food. This business
includes something that means a lot to each of us as showed in the
introductions.
Your contributions will really be the funding for this business. All three
of us our college students studying Entrepreneurship and running our own
business would give us a huge advantage compared to many others in this day,
Along with that you get some delicious food!
What We Need & What You Get
Funding for this project will help cover our basic start-up
costs as well as costs for the first couple weeks. Our start-up costs are around
$300 with a large amount of that being the bicycle to transport and deliver the
food. Day to day costs would run just under $100 a day to feed 50 people. We’ll
start off using some of the cooking supplies we already have, but after making
some profit we’ll buy our own cooking utensils. We’re hoping to get this project
completely funded otherwise this won’t be a possibility at this moment.
The Impact
We all know breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but we always
skip it for one reason or another. That’s why Food Bikes is here. We help
people get a good breakfast in for a low price and no work besides putting in
an order with us. This helps students work better in class and focus better in
the mornings which of course makes for better doctors, accountants, writers,
you name it they’ll be better because they ate breakfast!
Risks & Challenges
Like every business we have our challenges. When funded we will work on
getting a food permit from the state as well as other food facility permits we’ll
need. Solving these should be rather simple, just a matter of getting paperwork
done and getting in touch with the right people.
Challenges will be faced head on as we all have a part in this business and
want to see it succeed the best it can.

<p><span><b>How? </b>By merging philanthropy and entertainment</span></p>
<p><b>What? </b>We deliver radio, clothing, events, and service in which all actions have a purpose that serves the people.</p>
<p>This is so important to me because I came from a place that did not offer support for my creativity and differences that made me stand out to people around me. Because of my past, I can see the needs of others in communities. I'm hoping to connect with all of those communities to bring light on what we can do for them. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>To be as transparent as possible, our start up costs are $40,000. I am only asking for $500 initially. The $500 will go towards our first community event and samples for Imprinted Clothing. I want to be able to show people what the start of this amazing company will be, and with that I will be able to provide a visual for what we can and will do.</p>
<p>By donating to us, you are not only improving the community, you are providing  a way for a genuine company to make a difference. Aside from the ways that you will be benefiting Imprinted Souls, you are essentially fueling my life purpose. I have never felt stronger about anything in my life since I was 15 years old. Imprinted Souls as a company represents who I am as a person, my passions and purpose. I hope being able to impact someone's life is as meaningful to you as it is me.

<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p>Obviously, there are some risks in the business.  Here they are:</p>
<p>1. Certain areas for events may not have the turn out that we want. I understand that and have planned accordingly. We will be prepared for a small 20-50 people turn out for the first few events. I am reaching out for support in Nashville and surrounding areas from businesses and organizations that can help with promotion for a good cause. </p>
<p>2. Clothing costs, shipping, and volunteers. I am a single member within my company and we thrive from the support and volunteers of others. The clothing to begin with is designed by me and I handle all ordering, financial and shipping duties. I invest my own money into majority of the costs, order all product and also ship them out. I will need help in those three areas, which may cause some lag in the customer's experience until I have more help. I am currently looking for volunteers and I am seeing a good response rate. </p>
<p>3. Marketing and buzz. I have a rapport with many of our supporters because of word of mouth/ grass roots marketing and I do not currently pay for any advertising. Sales will be based on buzz until advertising can be budgeted. We do have awesome supporters who are always assisting us with this and I am confident that will be enough to start with. </p>

<br/><h3>The Chinese Word Stem Theory Retrieval Manual</h3>
<p>The Chinese Word Stem Theory Retrieval Manual was created by my self in 2001 consulting &lt;&lt;汉语大字典&gt;&gt;by ten years research , more than 20,000 GBK Chinese words computer code sorting developmant according to mathematical logic. <b>The searching of it's Father Stem Table only need two step, the 
pronunciation of stem and radical. The speed of searching is even 
superior to English. There is no such Table and method in Chinese 
history.</b>Now I am nearly 60 years old, I hope the manual will help globle people simplify Chinese learning. If I don't put forward the theory, maybe it will be effaced by time. <br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3>汉语字根理论检索手册</h3>汉语字根理论检索手册是我认真参照&lt;&lt;汉语大字典&gt;&gt;，历时十年以上通过对两万多GBK
汉字进行分析研究，根据数理逻辑理论，利用计算机编码排序技术对汉字五千年来演变、发展、派生、传承等关系和过程进行高度概括和论证于2001年完成的沥
血之作。<b>它的父根排序表的检索只需两步，字根读音，部首读音。不需要数笔画，大大减轻脑力开销。节约时间。数千年来没有过这样的检索表，也没有比这更快速高效的汉字检索方法。它的检索速度甚至优于英文。</b>现在我已经快六十岁了，我希望该手册能够帮助各国学生简化汉语的学习过程。我担心如果再不推广这项理论，也许它就会被时间所埋没。<br/>

<h3>原理的实例解释<br/>
</h3>The princeple of the theory can be understood by the following cluster words relation of ancestor word stem ‘勹’：
<p>该理论的原理可以通过‘勹’字根下字丛间的关系来理解：</p>
<p>Ancestor word stem ‘勹’derive the following chinese word:<br/></p>
<p>祖字根‘勹’派生出如下汉字：</p>

The Chinese word can be both The Stem and Radical.汉语字根理论的汉字第一定理：任何汉字由一个字根和一个部首两部分组成。部首为零是真字，部首非零为复字。汉字既可以是字根，也可以是部首。  Z=G.B注: Z 表示汉字，G 表示字根，B 表示部首。The Chinese Word Second Law of Chinese Stem Theory:As any word combined with radical form a new word, the word is the stem of the new word. The new word is the successor of the stem. The stem of nonzero successor is a true stem, the stem of zero successor is  a false stem. The true stem can be called complex word, the false stem can be called true word. The stem mainly function as accordatura, means that the rhyme of new word similar to the rhyme of the stem. The stem can not be zero. The stem can be devided as Ancestor Stem and Father Stem. The Ancestor stem originated from hieroglyphic, the father stem is true stem of new word.                  G=Z汉语字根理论的汉字第二定理:任何汉字只要和部首构成新的汉字，则该汉字是所构新汉字的字根。新构汉字是该字根的后继。后继非零的字根称为真字根，后继为零的字根称为伪字根。真字根又叫做复字，伪字根又叫做真字。字根在汉字中主要起定音作用，即所构新汉字与该字根之间一般存在着韵或声（主要为韵）的相似性。字根不能为零。字根又分祖字根和父字根；祖字根一般原于象形文字，父字根就是所构汉字的真字根。             G=ZThe Chinese Word Third Law of Chinese Stem Theory:The rest of word except the stem is called the radical.

The radical can be zero.             B=Z|nul                                   B indicate Radical     Z indicate Chinese Word汉语字根理论的汉字第三定理：在汉字中除字根外的剩余部分被称为部首。部首在汉字中主要起字义的分类作用。汉字字义一般属于其部首字意定义的范畴。部首可以为零。  B=Z|nul注: Z 表示汉字，G 表示字根，B 表示部首。The Chinese Word Stem Deriving Law (Sorting Law)of Chinese Stem Theory:Any human language follow the thinking logic of finalizing the design after the accordatura. The derive logic of Chinese Word is based on Stem, and make radical as decoration. The Stem is main sorting factor, and the radical is the second sorting factor.汉语字根理论的字根传承定理：（排序定理）任何人类语言文字均遵循先定音后定型的思维逻辑。汉语的传承派生逻辑是以字根为主干，以部首为装饰。汉字字根是主排序因子。部首是次排序因子。Retrieval Application of Father Stem Table

For Chinese word study, every body is on the road of learning. No body can pronunciate all the Chinese word cerrectly. All of us are Agan. No body can laugh at other.

</div></div>","Summary

 
I was so passionate about finding Meaning of Life, that I had studied this topic for years. I've found really good answers to this forever asked question, about the sense of existence.I think it's really important to have a sense of meaning in life and it's important for everybody. I want to share what I have discovered, with the world and Your sharing further would be very helpful in doing so.To make a good quality film it's needed to but some good video shots, music,  make computer stronger so it won't hang up while producing film and license for proper video programs .
Personally I am a coach, trainer, activist from non-government sector and privately I am passionate about life philosophy and the way the Universe works, especially WHY it works this way. I've finished a course on film making, where I was practically taking part in few roles as sound specialist, actor, camera operator and film director.

  What We Need

 From my counting $5600 would be enough for the project, that's why it's set as a goal.
If the amount won't be reached, I do my best to still realize the film, but probably it's quality will be lower by then, with less or worse materials bought. I want to make that film to contribute this way to the life of others.
I did the short video about the project (the one on youtube) for free with free materials, so something is possible that way, but those possibilities are limited, for example the databases of open-source video shots or music are not big, so it's better to use also the bought ones.


   Impact

 Film will be uploaded and offered for free to everyone on Internet under non-commercial use license. I have a little hope that commercial use might help to finance other future film production similar to this one. I hope to make subtitles in few languages, Spanish, Russian, Arabic, Chinese and maybe more with help of volunteers.I deeply hope that many people will find the film inspiring and somehow help them find their meaning in their life's. I plan to make a short teaser version and the full version of the film, both of them should be ready in November 2013 the latest.
  Risks & Challenges


 The challenge will be to promote the Film after it's done, but I hope that if I would succeed in this Indiegogo project with promotion then also I will succeed with the promotion of the final Film. The better it will be, the easier it will be to make it go viral in Internet. I think that the film production challenges will be easy to overcome as I know a some professional filmmakers in my city and I can approach them and asks for details or for help.
  Other Ways You Can Help


Some technical help with film making would be helpful, for example in preparing some animations or special effects. I would also appreciate help in consulting the plot, the content and plan of promotion of the final version and also in sharing this Indiegogo campaign and the Film itself!",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>The bactericidal action of ultraviolet rays was discovered about 100 years ago. The first laboratory testing of UVGI in the 1920s were so promising that the total elimination of airborne infections was seemed possible in the near future. UVGI has been actively used since the 1930s and in 1936 it was first used to sterilize air in a surgical operating room. In 1937, the first application of UVGI in the ventilation system of one of the American schools impressively reduced the incidence of morbidity of students of measles and other infections. Then it seemed that has found a wonderful way to combat airborne infections. However, further study of UVGI and dangerous side effects seriously narrowed the possibility of use it in the presence of people.</p>

<p>The power of penetration of the ultraviolet rays is small and they are distributed only in a straight line, i.e. there are a lot of shaded areas in any working premise that are not affected by a bactericidal treatment. With distance from the source of ultraviolet radiation its biocidal action is sharply reduced. The radiation effect is limited of the surface of the irradiated object.</p>
<p>UVGI irradiation is lethal for most aquatic bacteria, viruses, spores and protozoa. It destroys the causative agents of infectious diseases, such as typhoid, cholera, dysentery, viral hepatitis, polio, etc. Use of ultraviolet radiation allows achieve a more effective disinfection than chlorination, particularly against viruses.</p>
<p>Have you ever thought that bacteria and germs are living in the neighborhood of you? And most interestingly: a favorite place of dislocation of these unexpected friends is nothing else than your kitchen. Yes, invisible microorganisms lurk even behind the apparent perfect purity. They sit on your cutting board, look to your refrigerator and settle on the sponge for washing dishes. Therefore, in order to protect yourself and your family from tiny enemies, it is necessary to disinfect the cutlery, because even after washing, the microorganisms remain on it and penetrate into your body upon contact the cutlery with your mouth!</p>
<p>A favorite place of dances of bacteria is a kitchen towel. The risk is not high until you didn't wipe with it a next cutlery. But once you did it: wiped fork, spoon, knife, and then wiped the surface of the table, all ready the soil for reproduction of microorganisms prepared. Therefore, we recommend you first wash and dry, and then sure to handle!</p>
