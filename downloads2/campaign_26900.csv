</div></div>","It started with the desire to make a difference in a community and in the lives of all students - one child at a time. 



Who we are and what we're doing:
Side x Side is a non-profit organization that is Awakening Tomorrow's Innovators - one child at a time. We believe that the best education has creativity at its heart. This belief led to a 2013 partnership with the University of Southern Maine and the development of Side x Side Inc. in 2014. 

Side x Side makes education come alive through community partnerships that bring arts into the classroom and engage all students. We work with classroom teachers, local artists and professionals, and college interns to reinforce core academic concepts through creative programming.                                              
                                                                     Research shows that arts-enriched programs: 





Have greater impact on academic performance 
Reach students with different learning styles
Engage struggling students and enable advanced students to flourish 

Create a feeling of connection and cooperation among students 

Help make schools exciting places to learn 






See measured results of the 49 Turnaround Arts schools led by the President's Committee on the Arts and Humanities together with the US Department of Education, the National Endowment for the Arts and local partners. Turnaround Arts brings arts integration to a group of the lowest-performing elementary and middle schools in the country. 

This year, we have become bigger than we could have imagined! 

In 2014 we launched Side x Side programming in one elementary school impacting just over 300 students. This year with the continued support of the US Department of Education and other funding:
We are impacting
1,700 students in four local elementary schools. This academic year students will create...


150
colorful prints
240 beautiful books
250 papier-mâché sculptures
120 painted maps

2 large-scale permanent murals

6 physical theater performances
52
short films

10 kinetic sculptures  


all
designed to reinforce learning in reading, writing, math, science and
social studies.
We are providing practical learning experiences for 15 college interns. Art and General Education students from the University of Southern Maine are interning with Side x Side classroom teachers and teaching artists. These students will become our future teachers!
We’ve established working partnerships
with...

University of Southern Maine
Portland Public Schools
Portland Museum
of Art
Portland Public Library
Maine Historical Society
Portland Ovations
Portland ConnectED
South Portland School Department. 

We continuously seek
ways to build bridges between the arts and education communities.







Why we need your help:


We’ve raised 95% of our
programming and operating costs through grant writing and other fundraising
efforts. Our US Department of
Education grant supports current elementary programming, most of our teacher trainings and some operating costs. 



But that last 5% is crucial for us to continue our work. Expansion of our programs and overhead costs are not covered by any of the grants we’ve secured despite how necessary they are. That's why we're turning to you. Donations will allow us to keep the lights on and continue our work so we can expand our reach to even more schools, teachers, students and communities.             
                                                                                                            

lf we meet our goals, we will be able to:
•pilot a middle school arts-based program•continue to build our STEAM-focused high school program - Artronics•secure occupancy and overhead needs critical to Side x Side’s stability and growth.
                                      




How you can help:
A donation to this campaign will help us...  


...so that our programming will reach even more students!
If you can’t donate today, you can still help!  Please share this campaign with your friends and family, colleagues, and acquaintances. Let them know about us and that you support our mission.http://igg.me/at/sidexside

I chose the Nostre Dame de Grasse, a 15th-century sculpture of unknown origin now in the Musée des Augustins in Toulouse. Investigating this work reignited the research bug, and I knew I couldn’t stop studying when the course finished. I received a Distinction for the course and 92% for the dissertation, which made me realise yes, my brain was up to it, and I could juggle work, family and study. With the support of family, friends and, crucially, Dr John Richards, one of my original tutors at St Andrews with whom I’ve stayed in touch (now senior lecturer in art history at the University of Glasgow) I decided to pursue a lifelong ambition: to study for a PhD. I found the perfect supervisor, Dr Kathryn M. Rudy, senior lecturer in art history at the University of St Andrews. She loved my proposal, saw why this research needed to be done, and why I was the ideal candidate to do it. We met when she came to France to do some archival work in Agen. She encouraged me to dig deep to maximise my potential. I now appreciate, before I’ve even officially started this research, that anything is possible if you try hard enough. I had great fun with my support team creating some inventive Perks - like sourcing your name in medieval Occitan and devising a bespoke art history travel itinerary - so please have a look to see what tickles your fancy. It’s incredibly difficult for me to ask for this help, but your support would mean the world to me. Even if you can’t make a financial contribution, building buzz around my campaign by sharing with your friends and contacts by email and on social media will make a huge difference. The nice people at Indiegogo provide share tools to make this easier for you.  Thank you so much for reading.Julia",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

My name is Terry Nichols and I am the wife of a veteran that served in a war zone. When he returned home from his service myself, our family and our community had little understanding of his experience in the military and as a contemporary veteran. As a result of this lack of awareness, it is difficult to support and understand our veterans.
In 2014 we founded the Communities For Veterans Foundation and in 2015 we conducted a 211 day national  awareness campaign on horseback from Victoria, BC to St.John's Newfoundland. My husband, Paul, rode over 7,000 kms in order to bring awareness and support to our contemporary veterans. We connected with thousands of veterans and tens of thousands of civilians.
I grew up with little connection to military culture and in a family where nobody that I knew had served. It was this disconnect that lead to struggles in our family when my husband returned from serving in a war zone. Education is the key!
I had the opportunity to tell ""My Sheep Story"" hundred of times as we travelled across the country to bring veterans and communities closer together. I witness the positive impact that this story had every time I told it. Some examples of the feedback that I have heard

I have been told by veterans that this story has changed their lives.

I have created an awareness of the important role of our military
I have found a way to bring this awareness in a simple story suitable for all ages

The Impact
Your contribution to this campaign will help make ""My Sheep Story"" available as soon as possible. This will bring awareness to our contemporary veterans and their families. This new awareness will lead to stronger veterans, families, and communities.
 

In order for our veterans to receive the support and understanding that they need, there needs to be a shift in the thinking and understanding in our civilian culture. It is community that is needed when our veterans leave the military.
My goals after printing ""My Sheep Story"" include taking my story to communities to further educate. The message in this book needs to be heard. It will make a difference.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>After my first effort in 2014, to present to you in a book the traditional costumes of North Evia and the folk culture linked with it, - which was published thanks to your support! (find it <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-traditional-greek-costumes-of-north-evia/x/9445522#/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">in the link here</a>)-I come back to ask you again to <strong>support the publishing of my second book</strong> <strong>on </strong>Greek Euboean Folk Civilization, dedicated on <strong>our local Euboean idiomatic Greek language.</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480448011/csqgtpuasokpqw2t0glg.png"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p>This local language of the northern part of Evia Island is important, as it is an idiom <u>consisting mostly of preserved ancient Greek words that were slightly amended through the years. </u>This happened because of the area’s isolation, as until the mid 20th century the only access to northern Evia Island was by small boats, and the communication and cultural exchange with other people was little.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1480448060/yuarp3naeaswg3ltbvsr.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>I first realized that my fellow citizens and I had a different manner of speaking when I was studying at the university. It was then that I discovered many of the words I used while speaking were unknown to my classmates. For me, this language seemed natural since I had grown up hearing these words from my grand-parents in my mother’s village and from my parents at home. I started collecting words and idiomatic phrases 13 years ago, and I now have  a collection of more than 3000, along with their history and the stories behind them! Each word or phrase is unique, and constitutes a nostalgic part of our Greek roots and a piece of our local history!</p>

<p>In the book, we chose to combine the words along with the stories in the idiomatic language, told by our grand-parents to the recorders of the early 20th century, that first tried to capture the idiom, when people talked in this way more vibrantly. I also wrote by myself in the local idiom, and include them in the book, seven theatrical act plays which can inspire Greek Teachers and be dramatized by Greek Schools or Greek Folk Dancers, to induce children to get in touch with the idiomatic language and take a look at the way of living of our ancestors, while the older ones will be reminded of nostalgic memories from the past. The book is also documented by its bibliography, consisting of about 200 references from old books and personal testimonies.</p>

<p>The writer, <a href=""https://greekcultureellinikospolitismos.wordpress.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Asimina Nteliou</a>, comes from the island of Evia in Greece, where she lives. Passionate of the Greek tradition, she is researching the authentic aspects of Greek folk civilization, photographing and recording all the wisdom and morals of the Greek islanders, before the old ones die and the knowledge is lost. Her first published book, <a href=""http://fylatos.com/shop/%CF%80%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%B4%CE%BF%CF%83%CE%B9%CE%B1%CE%BA%CE%AD%CF%82-%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%BB%CE%B7%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AD%CF%82-%CF%86%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%B5%CF%83%CE%B9%CE%AD%CF%82-%CE%B2%CF%8C%CF%81/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">“The Traditional Greek Costumes of North Evia”</a> which preserved the knowledge related to the folk costumes and jewels of Evia, and links it with the customs and the ancient and byzantine origin of Greek people, was honored with the Kaftantzogleio Award 2014 by the Faculty of Philosophy of the National Kapodistrian University of Athens. She is married to <a href=""http://ramiotisart.blogspot.gr/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Theofanis Ramiotis</a>, a goldsmith and jewel conservator, who reproduces exact copies of the Greek traditional jewels by old techniques and designs contemporary jewels inspired from the Greek traditional culture. They both share the vision to preserve the Greek folk civilization and promote it by a series of books and expositions all over the world, highlighting it as world heritage.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>My homeland, Evia, is not as famous as other Greek Islands; however, it has a less known and amazing civilization. Researchers have found that the roots of the Latin alphabet, spread all over the world, are based on the ancient Chalkidean alphabet, through the Chalkis’ colonies which are located in Italy (Chalkis is the capital of Evia).</p>
<p>Our local idiomatic Euboean Greek language, which is the evolution of the ancient one, is important and should be recorded, preserved, and not allowed to disappear. As the years pass and we Greeks mix with people from other countries, we tend to adopt mostly the foreign words rather than preserve our local ones.  In a world that we all tend to act and be the same, speaking our local idiom, makes us a bit somehow different. In this way we become a part of our homeland’s history, a fruit from our ancestors’ tree and a seed for our own children.</p>
<p>This book aims to be a small stone to saving and preserving the wall of the Greek North Euboean idiom and keep it safe to be transmitted to our children. In this way we can offer to our children a rare linguistic material, and introduce them to our roots and our continuity as a nation. That is why I encourage you to fund this book so it will be published and reach as many people as possible.</p>
<p>In order to publish this book, some essential publishing work must be done. The cost of the book's design, printing and distribution is 650 Euros or 700 USD. Furthermore, the circulation of the printed book requires printing at least a small batch of premium quality books. This is planned to cost 250 Euros or 270 USD. If the campaign is successful, it will be available in e-book format, which is estimated to cost around 350 Euros or 380 USD.</p>
<p>Every person that helps us gets something. Whether a thank you note on an old fashioned post card depicting Euboea, a contemporary Evia or Greece design pendant, or a valuable piece of jewelry, which will be an exact copy of the traditional art of Greece.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Publishing this book in both printed and ebook formats is a significant way to save, learn, protect, study and continue the traditional Greek folk language and deliver it to new generations of people, which is not only a matter of a small social group, but of world heritage. </p>
<p>Moreover, the writer will be able through the book's presentations to sensitize people all over Greece and world, on the preservation of the Greek idioms. The same happened with her first book <a href=""http://fylatos.com/shop/%CF%80%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%B1%CE%B4%CE%BF%CF%83%CE%B9%CE%B1%CE%BA%CE%AD%CF%82-%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%BB%CE%B7%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AD%CF%82-%CF%86%CE%BF%CF%81%CE%B5%CF%83%CE%B9%CE%AD%CF%82-%CE%B2%CF%8C%CF%81/?removed_item=1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">""The Traditional Greek Costumes of North Evia""</a>. The last two years people all over Greece and world learned more about the stunning Greek Folk Art and were introduced to unknown traditional Greek costumes.

Also included in the book is a glossary of herbal terms and lists of resources for further exploration of herbal medicine, botany, plant conservation, and botanical illustration.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1489763185/zunm3pndca8gloxkx8qq.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h3>Learn the medicinal and botanical characteristics of 25 herbs with our community-sourced coloring book.</h3><p>For this first volume, we chose to focus on the plants commonly found growing wild in the Northeast, whether native or introduced.

We're already imagining this book keeping us company as we snuggle in to unwind on Winter afternoons with a cup of tea. Or maybe it's time for a wine-and-coloring evening with friends? Whatever your pleasure, just leafing through the pages to admire the skill of the artists and the beauty of the plants is already making us more relaxed!</p><p>We also hope this book will be used as a learning tool in indoor and outdoor classrooms, at kid’s camps and herb schools, and at kitchen tables by curious folks of all ages.

Having seen a coloring book of medicinal herbs of the Northwestern United States, she proposed the idea of compiling our own drawings, concentrating on plants of the Northeast. When asked if they would be interested in pursuing this project of sharing “beauty and medicine”, students and staff were enthusiastically supportive and so our coloring book was born.To extend the impact and value of the project, we've added useful information about each plant, including botanical and common names, family, parts used, habitat and growth habits, at-risk status, medicinal actions, and energetic qualities. Also included in the book is a glossary of herbal terms and lists of resources for further exploration of herbal medicine, botany, plant conservation, and botanical illustration.Learn the medicinal and botanical characteristics of 25 herbs with our community-sourced coloring book.For this first volume, we chose to focus on the plants commonly found growing wild in the Northeast, whether native or introduced. Even if you live in other regions of the country, many of the plants we’ve included will be familiar or even found in your ecosystems, too.We’ve divided the book into sections according to where the plants live: woodlands, fields and meadows, and wet places. Some are at-risk species that we don’t recommend harvesting for medicine, but which have an important history of use for healing, nonetheless.The plants you’ll find in the coloring book include:Woodlands:  black cohosh, bloodroot, goldenseal, partridge berry, sassafras, solomon’s seal, trillium, violet, wintergreenFields and Meadows: boneset, echinacea, elecampane, goldenrod, lobelia, plantain, poke, self heal, St. John’s wort, yarrowWet Places: calamus, elder, figwort, skullcap, sundewColoring is now being promoted as an active meditation tool, beneficial for relieving stress, whether done alone or in groups. We're already imagining this book keeping us company as we snuggle in to unwind on Winter afternoons with a cup of tea. Or maybe it's time for a wine-and-coloring evening with friends? Whatever your pleasure, just leafing through the pages to admire the skill of the artists and the beauty of the plants is already making us more relaxed!We also hope this book will be used as a learning tool in indoor and outdoor classrooms, at kid’s camps and herb schools, and at kitchen tables by curious folks of all ages. Ultimately, we’re hoping to make learning about medicinal plants easy, inspiring, and fun.All proceeds from this project help fund our sliding-scale herbal clinics and apothecary.Your purchase will not only encourage personal relaxation, learning, and connection to nature, it will also help build community health through support of our mission-driven work.Our clinics offer direct service through individualized education in self-care with herbs. We offer consultations in our professional clinic in Montpelier and in our supervised student clinics in both Montpelier and Burlington, Vermont. Our clinical services and herbs are available through sliding-scale payment, time exchange and gift; no one is turned away for lack of funds.That’s where this project comes in: every little bit of support helps us provide more herbs and consultation time, while keeping the lights on and the apothecary stocked.You can read more about our clinics and commitment to accessibility of care here.More about VCIH:Vermont Center for Integrative Herbalism (VCIH) is an educational grassroots non-profit, founded in 2007 by a group of experienced herbalists and activists, working through collaborative leadership to change what healthcare looks like.Please visit our website for more information about community classes, intensive training programs, and our clinical services, as well as our dedicated team.

I moved to the United States when I was 19 to go to college. Living abroad and seeing the opportunities provided to US students showed me the vast potential for education development and expansion in my country for African youth. I started Collegestreet from my dorm room. As a young boy in Africa, I was troubled to see how kids in my village walked 10-12 miles every day to school with excitement to earn their high school diploma. Unfortunately, 90% of them will never be able to afford the opportunity to go to college.  I said to myself, ""when I grow up, I am going to find a way to help parents send their children to college!""<br/> </p><h3>How can your contribution help pay for a university degree? </h3><p>We select education programs that offer the highest return, and recruit the most talented students.

Our Mission 
 Countless girls around the world start their day with one massive challenge: they live too far from their school. Six graders spending up to hours walking every morning, arriving with the breath of exhausted and stomach of hunger. With the road to education literally too far, many bight young minds have no other path except child marriage. We, a group of high school students, want to put an end to this with bicycles.    The Story of Aanya 
Let's travel to the life of a girl named Aanya. She's living in the village of Debidwar, Bangladesh with her brother and single mother. Although her mother was only a maid,  it did not stop Aanya from dreaming to become a doctor. For too long, she saw the dying in her village with no one to treat them. Hence everyday, motivated and empowered by her dream, she came to school to do her best.   
But to continue on to secondary education, she must journey to another school in another town. Her village school can only teach her so much. She can walk, but the road is too far. What little money her family has can barely keep food on the table, let alone to pay for daily bus rides. 
No longer able to continue her education, the only path left for Aanya is for her mother to arrange an older man to marry. And so, a wedding is called. In the midst of the newly wed, Aanya's dream of becoming a doctor is destroyed. At the age of 16, she is now the belonging to someone else. No longer is Aanya controlling her own path, chasing her own dream. BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY
With just a BICYCLE, Aanya can get to the school next town well under an hour. Her studies continue, her books stay open. Aanya is at the chase again. Her dream is now within her reach. That's the power of a bicycle.    Inspiration for BIKES of HOPE

In order to empower young ambitious youth like Aanya,  our group of high school students from New York, California, and Florida came together to found LyfeCycle. We started fundraising the classical way, baking cookies in our schools, putting lemonade stands in NYC. Through careful coordination with Cardiff International School in Bangladesh, we were able to establish an avenue to provide bicycles to underprivileged youths with our funds. We launched our first campaign last year with sounding success. Although that first project ended, our real work is only starting.


With our first distribution a success, we were also able to attract numerous press recognition throughout the country and attention around the local community. LyfeCycle has transformed beyond just a project by high school students and into a movement!  






In order to establish a more solid foundation, we move to obtain legalization with the help of one of the top law firms in the world: Kirkland & Ellis. Today, LyfeCycle is a fully incorporated 501(3)(c) non-profit organization with all donations tax-deductible.  



It doesn’t take much to make a difference. For only $75, you can support one student for years to come and help provide hope to a family, to a community, to a nation's future. By giving this one bicycle, you are opening the doors to education and accessibility to keep students in school. 


With your support, we hope to send 20 bicycles to the village of Bakshar in Bangladesh. The cost of $75 will cover the purchase of one bicycle locally from the closest city and the transportation cost to the village. 
We will be posting updates for you to see and hear the stories of the children selected here on Indiegogo. You can learn of their hopes and dreams, happiness and struggles.

</div><p><b>What does GenerationYuvaa mean?</b></p>
<p>‘Yuvaa’ in most of the Indian
languages mean Youth. We are a group of youngsters fighting against Child
begging and uplifting underprivileged children in Vishakhapatnam, a district
located in the state of Andhra Pradesh in the South India.</p>
<p><b>Why to Eradicate Child Begging and Uplift Children?</b></p>
<p>Begging prevents children from realizing their full
potential. Unfortunately, these children have a very tough time breaking out of
their helpless situation. Since begging is still considered a shame, beggars
move to places and states where their original family identity cannot be easily
recognized by people from whom they seek alms. Some beggars are professional
beggars in the sense that begging becomes a chosen profession for them. The
earnings they make through begging are carefully saved and sent home to support
the other family member However, the number of people who beg out of indigent
circumstances still appears to be very large in India. The amazing fact is that
many beggars are professional beggars and many of them are involved with
criminals. In many big cities in India beggars are much organized and do their
work with lot of planning.</p>
<p><b>Types of Child Begging:</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454094461/ei8msisufbd4vbifxoq4.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The children directly beg the money from the public while
sometimes the child is used as a medium for doing the same. Each pattern is
briefly explained below.</span><br/></p>
<p>In Mother Child begging, the child is used as a medium for
begging. Usually the mother is seen carrying the child who is either conscious
or unconscious. Children are made unconscious by giving them some unconscious
causing drugs and then beg from the people for their recovery and taking them
to hospital.</p>
<p>The other side of this story is that often these children
are not their own, they were either purchased from poor families or kidnapped
from different places of India. Many of these children die or lose their mental
balance due to this regular poisoning.</p>
<p>Another pattern that is noticed is where the child is
begging directly by amusing people with the help of an animal like a monkey or
performing certain tricky acts like walking on a rope etc., another common
pattern is where the child paints himself like Gandhi and asking for money.</p>
<p>Being physically handicapped and using this to beg is also
something that is seen very common while begging. Most of the times, it is seen
that the child is pretending to be handicapped and is not actually so.
Sometimes children are forced to lose their limbs so that they can be a medium
for begging throughout their life. These kinds of atrocities are also done by
certain gangs that operate begging about which we will be discussing later in
the report.</p>
<p>Religion is also used as a medium for begging in children
where the child is either in attire that represents certain religion or the
child is seen carrying photos of Gods while begging.</p>
<p><b>Factors responsible for child begging:</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454094489/iqhl76f5xakrbsj7hrsh.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>
</p><p>There are varied factors that influence these children to
choose begging as a means of earning money. Some of them are discussed below.</p>
<p>One of the major reasons that are seen is that the family is
from below the poverty line and usually the parents are the one who choose
begging for their children. The money that is earned by the child by begging is
used to support the family financially.</p>
<p>One of the other reasons is that the child is an orphan and
is directed towards begging by the other children or the families that are
already into begging.</p>
<p>It is also seen that begging is operated as an organized
crime by a gang. They buy or rent children to use them for begging and thus the
children get involved in the vicious circle. And often it is impossible for
them to break out of it.</p>
<p><b>Effects of Child Begging:</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1454094519/wphrq8zrbfi3cb4rdptt.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p><br/>
<p>
</p><p>The entire child's holistic development is majorly disrupted
in this issue. Some factors are discussed below.</p>
<p>The child's health and mental health is affected negatively.
Different domains of the child's development like behavior, education,
psychological development and various other domains are affected.</p>
<p>There is also a high possibility that the child is exposed
to issue that are not appropriate for his/her age. For example getting into
drugs leading them into drug addicts or early exposure to sex are huge risks
for the child well-being.</p>
<p>Children who are involved in this cycle will automatically
guide their next generation into same situation of begging.</p>
<p>These children are often seen adapting to anti- social
behavior leading them to involve in issues like thefts, crime and other
malpractices.</p>
<p><b>Statistics of Child Begging in Visakhapatnam:</b></p>
<p>In Visakhaptanam district, there are approximately 450 to
500 Child Begga₹ The ratio of Girl beggars to the Boy beggars is 1:1 which
means that there are equal number of girls and boys who are into begging.
Certain areas where the Child Beggars are seen that most are railway station, bus complex, beach, road signal junctions, temples etc. These migrated families
don't stay in one place and are seen travelling from one area to another. So
tracing them and keeping a trace of them is often a challenge.</p>
<p><b>Policies and legislation on Child Begging and its Violation:</b></p>
<p>Children Care and Protection Act, Sec (a) and Sec (b) of
Juvenile Justice Care &amp; Protection Act, 2000 (Amended 2006) which was
earlier called as Juvenile Act, is the act that exists for these children.
Children below 18 years, both girls and boys come under this act. Earlier the
age limit was 15 years for girls and 18 years for boys but now it has been made
as 18 years for both the genders. The Act states that the children who are
involved in begging are counted as neglected children and the children can be
moved to rehabilitation centers for their positive development. Parents who are
identified as a part of this and if we have an identified testimony will have
to be counseled and explained about the well-being of the child. Our project is
designed as per these guidelines.</p>

<p>GenerationYuvaa has started a Child Home in temporary
residence to provide a shelter for street children, orphans and street beggars. We
are still in process of raising funds a permanent dream home which we would

strength right now is capped to 50 children due to lack of funds. These
children are provided with basic facilities like shelter, clothing and food
along with education. Some of these children who are old enough to go to school
are funded for their education. Along with this, the child overall development
is also focused by indulging them in various physical activities and play.
Certain standards are followed while preparing food keeping the nutrition norms
in mind. Along with this, weekly health checkups are done by medical
professionals.</p>

</p><p><b>Interventions by GenerationYuvaa:</b></p>
<p><b>Spreading awareness:</b> GenerationYuvaa
focuses on spreading a lot of awareness about child begging to bring the focus

to pay for everything up front including course fees, accommodation and food. Which is a pretty big feat if you come from any normal income household  and are only 19 with no savings. This
leaves her having to take out regular loans and results in her only being able to apportion £50 a month to pay for food and resources!</p><p>The money raised will be going towards these costs, although it won't cover it all ( she will still need to work full time for 3 months over the summer break) it will make a phenomenal difference in enabling her to pay for it.</p><p>
</p><p>The loans are not safe-netted like they are for the rest of us
students when we use Student Finance England; when you have no money/ are not earning enough you still have to pay.
Plus You pay it back with a hefty interest.</p>
<p><strong><br/></strong></p>
<p>Personally, I have donated to many crowd-funded causes before. I really like it’s concept; that<strong>
there is no middle man; there are no over-heads so your money goes solely to the cause. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Now guys it’s up to you! </strong></p><p><strong>I am going to be
cycling in April to the Brecon Beacons which is approx. 110 miles from Coventry to show
my support.</strong></p><p><strong> </strong>I didn’t decide to do a sponsored sky dive or anything of that
nature because it can be viewed as a bit of fun and I really wanted to
demonstrate to you that I am not self-interested in that manner and that I’d really like people to get involved and how important it is
of a problem that I will cycle all that way and train for months to get
that point across. </p>
<p><b>A burden shared is a burden lightened.</b></p>
<p><b></b></p><p><strong>Each donation is a massive help! </strong></p><p><strong>Please share to spread the word!</strong></p><p><strong>Thank you!!!! <br/></strong></p><p><strong><br/></strong></p><p><strong><br/></strong></p><p><strong>P.s </strong></p><p><strong>Seems do-able right?</strong></p><p><strong>Well if we can share and encourage others to support, I'm sure we'll smash it! </strong></p><p><strong>And thank you so much for your support!!! </strong></p>

leaves her having to take out regular loans and results in her only being able to apportion £50 a month to pay for food and resources!The money raised will be going towards these costs, although it won't cover it all ( she will still need to work full time for 3 months over the summer break) it will make a phenomenal difference in enabling her to pay for it.
The loans are not safe-netted like they are for the rest of us
students when we use Student Finance England; when you have no money/ are not earning enough you still have to pay.
Plus You pay it back with a hefty interest.

Personally, I have donated to many crowd-funded causes before. I really like it’s concept; that
there is no middle man; there are no over-heads so your money goes solely to the cause. 
Now guys it’s up to you! I am going to be
cycling in April to the Brecon Beacons which is approx. 110 miles from Coventry to show
my support. I didn’t decide to do a sponsored sky dive or anything of that
nature because it can be viewed as a bit of fun and I really wanted to
demonstrate to you that I am not self-interested in that manner and that I’d really like people to get involved and how important it is
of a problem that I will cycle all that way and train for months to get
that point across. 
A burden shared is a burden lightened.
Each donation is a massive help! Please share to spread the word!Thank you!!!! P.s Seems do-able right?Well if we can share and encourage others to support, I'm sure we'll smash it! And thank you so much for your support!!!",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h2>Who We Are and What We Do:</h2>
<p>Hello. My name is Kelsey Beth. I am an international educator, designer, mindfulness activist, and citizen of the world. </p>
<p>I want every child to be seen and met exactly as they are.</p>
<p>I want our future generation to know and develop their own truth and purpose for being on this planet. </p>
<p>I want to transform the way we Educate our children and our future, from the inside-out.</p>
<p>This vision grew from my experiences working and teaching around the globe. During this time, I transformed from a young, and passionate teacher to a stressed-out and unhealthy educator, who felt the intense demands of our constantly changing Education Systems. </p>
<p>I was teaching a curriculum I didn’t believe in and administering standardized tests that was against what I believed was good for the children.</p>
<p>I spent my breaks doing administrative work instead of planning and truly being there for the kids.</p>
<p>My Vision of Education empowers individuals and allows their natural talents and passions to unfold, instead of placing them in a box, on a scale, or assigned to a number.  </p>

<p><span>Mindful kids will change our World because they: </span></p>
<ul>
<li>Can breathe through difficult situations and are aware of their own behavior and emotions </li>
<li>Have a greater sense of focus and larger attention span</li>
<li>Are able to think in different ways in order to solve problems on their own</li>
<li>Experience reduced stress, anxiety, and reactivity to difficult situations</li>
<li>Are able to trace their own thoughts and explain how their thoughts are related to their own  feelings, or actions</li>
<li>Have an improved sense of confidence and self-worth and are able to acknowledge their own strengths</li>
<li>Experience a greater sense of calm and inner peace, as well as improved sleep</li>
<li>Have a deep awareness and understanding of themselves</li>
<li>Are able to connect with others in meaningful ways</li>
<li>Experience greater mental, emotional, and physical well-being, positive emotion, and social connections</li>

My name is Nigel Brown, CEO/Founder of Lyncme, Inc. As a software engineer, I decided to build Lyncme, a social networking app to give social networking control back to the user with two concepts. Private &amp; Public Networks.<br/>This means anyone can create his/her own private social networks by adding invited guests and excluding others. No more worrying about “catfishing”, or employers scanning your profiles because all posts, photos, and videos are private within your networks. Also, anyone you allow to join your networks will not be able to download anything they do not actually post. Put your friends in tiers! Separate friends from acquaintances! <br/><br/>Public networks are available to keep you updated with content you care about such as:<br/><b>•	Nightlife – Never ask what to do anymore!<br/>•	Vacations – Plan your activities such as concerts, events and parties from the public nightlife network before your arrival.<br/>•	Searching for a Home to Buy or Rent – Join the public real estate network. You can find a home in your area, search another area, talk to a property agent, etc. Agents will now always know where the market base is when they need them. </b><br/>I have provided a multi-tiered platform that caters to your personal interests. See a party you like in the nightlife network? Interested in buying tickets to an event? Want to be the first to view a home? Well you have access directly within Lyncme!<br/>Now you have a direct connection to everything you need to have a great social experience in one place! Best of all, you can separate your private networks from your public ones.

</div></div>","Fundraising Campaign for the Future of Learning - 

SOLE (Self Organised Learning Environment)


The School in the Cloud is an educational initiative in which memorization takes a backseat to curiosity. The heart of this approach is the SOLE, or self-organized learning environment. In SOLEs, children work in groups, using the Internet to explore the kind of big questions that spark imagination. Rather than being tested on knowing the answers, students help each other discover answers or are encouraged by e-mediators in the ""Granny Cloud.""
                       SOLEs take place in locations as diverse as Greenland, where they are being used in a school with a large Inuit population, to the Indian jungle, where children walk to physical learning labs for the opportunity to experiment with SOLE.  Launched by Sugata Mitra with the 2013 TED Prize, the School in the Cloud is now a global phenomenon. Join us as we fundraise to spread SOLEs to classrooms around the world, and to places with limited access to traditional educators.
We aim to inspire students to ask and solve Big Questions while teaching each other the intricate paths of knowledge. After more than 400 SOLEs, we have seen students from 3 to 12 years of age collaborate, discuss information, think of creative ways to explain this information and then discuss findings to arrive to a diversity of answers. SOLE also seeks to understand how students self-organize for learning. More precisely, we are investigating how SOLE impacts students' reading comprehension, critical thinking and social skills.      
The Granny Cloud consists of 100+ dedicated volunteers from around the world who Skype into remote locations to chat with children. By encouraging kids rather than giving outright instruction, they guide students on their SOLE adventures. Don't be fooled by the name — you don't need to be an actual granny to be a part of the Granny Cloud. Grannies range in age from 24 to 78, and are both male and female. What they all share: a universal ""grandmother approach"" to education. By providing unconditional encouragement, Grannies create an environment where children can thrive.          
The whole concept started with putting computers in the slums of India, and now it’s become a global movement. Having seen the impact first-hand, I’m confident self-organized learning and School in the Cloud will play a large role in shaping the future of education. Please consider donating to help support the next chapter of School in the Cloud.

Your Impact:Your donations will help to support this movement and scale up School in the Cloud initiatives1. Create new SOLE (Cost $1000 per SOLE)2. Support each SOLE (Cost $10 per month per SOLE)Learning Labs -Where kids guide the lesson
School in the Cloud has physical learning labs in India to experiment with all things SOLE. Dotted with computers and decorated with care, these labs create an environment that stimulates curiosity, and inspires kids to explore the world at their fingertips. From the School in the Cloud hub near Calcutta to remote labs in the jungle of West Bengal, these labs provide educational opportunities for children living there and give a sense of pride to communities that want to offer much more.
The Granny Cloud -Educators on call, via Skype

Global SOLES - A global education community
SOLEs are shaking up education in and out of the classroom.

<p>Over fifteen years of action research has led to the development of an early childhood learning model in Bangladesh. It is aimed at preparing children from disadvantaged families in the country to enroll in local primary schools at the end of a year's stay at a preschool center. The model is based on a no-cost/low-cost approach to run a center by the local community based on voluntary support. Around 30 children from the local community attend the centers for 3 to 4 hours a day for learning through fun and game. No books, paper or pencil are used. Pocket boards, pocket cards and blackboards are used instead to impart learning. Children learn to read and write in Bengali and English as well as to count and do ordinary math. The centers are called Kajoli Centers, based on the origin of the model in a village named Kajoli in Magura District of Bangladesh.</p>
<p>Research Initiatives, Bangladesh (RIB), a Bangladeshi NGO, which helped to promote the research, has spread the Kajoli model throughout the country. It helped communities with ideas on how to go about finding a place for the children of the centers to meet every weekday at someone’s unused space, find children aged between 4 to 5, identify teachers from within the community, train the teachers to learn to use the model, provide the learning materials mentioned above and identify local animators/champions to mobilize and sustain community support.</p>
<p>Parents of Kajoli children contribute to teacher’s monthly remuneration, based on their ability. Mothers provide midday meals to the children, each taking turn to feed the children at least once a month . In short, the whole approach is based on community participation. All over Bangladesh there are over 150 Kajoli centers established over the last fifteen years. While most of them are doing well with varying community support, there is a felt need for support in some of the centres to make them more attractive to children. Hence this effort to raise fund to help the centres with infrastructure building, including building/repairing class rooms, toilets and tubes-wells, providing playground equipment etc.</p>

<p>Cameron Eaton is the Founder/ Director of Sanctuary Cultural Arts Center and has opened and been a fundamental member of centers across the country including: SPACE, in Oakland,  The A.R.K. In New Orleans, The New Orleans of Circus Arts and more.  She has worked as an educator and consultant for countless non-profit organizations across the US and has spent the last 23 years learning all she can about community organization, non-profits, marketing and cultivating creative communities. Cameron also comes from a performance background and is a multi-media performance artist, writer, educator, and creative collaborator with over 25 years of professional experience within the arts and entertainment industries.</p>
<p>Cameron and Arianna’s intention is to fuse their performance backgrounds into unique, interactive, performance art experiences for a multitude of audiences. They are currently working hard to establish classes, community events, workshops and fundraising events for the NEW Circus Arts Movement of New Orleans.

<p><u><strong>What is Sanctuary?</strong></u></p>
<p>Sanctuary is a place to cross pollinate the performing arts with classes in a variety of disciplines. From health and wellness to performing and visual arts; classes include yoga, pilates, theater, dance, art, craft, burlesque, and of course circus arts! Our mission is to provide educational opportunities in a variety of disciplines, to incubate collaborative, multi-media ideas and to curate / produce new work. We are inviting performers, artists and educators from all over the world to come to our center to teach, exhibit and produce a wide range of performances in our space. We have already had guest artists come perform, exhibit and teach from Barcelona, Indonesia, Canada, San Francisco and Portland Oregon.</p>
<h3><u>The Campaign </u></h3>
<p>This Campaign is to fund the additional equipment needed , to help fund our artist in residence program and will help us cover operating and production costs for the first year at Sanctuary. We need equipment for circus classes, productions, aerial rigging, crash mats, and numerous other things needed to cultivate the art of circus. We as Artists feel the need to share our work and spread the art form to the community, in order to do so we would like to teach community classes and have a safe space to train and rehearse, perform in. Our intent is to empower people to become more connected with their bodies as tools for creating engaging works of art for fun and enjoyment! By donating to this campaign, you will become an integral part of supporting artists in our community and will help us not only share circus throughout New Orleans, but will also allow us to hone our craft as we continue to develop new work in hopes of touring our work nationally and internationally.  It is our goal to keep our beautiful artistic city vibrant in the Circus Arts as it once was years ago. The New Circus movement of New Orleans has been on the rise in the past few years and the next step is occupying and creating a home space so we may continue to grow and develop. Sanctuary will offer open training time, circus community events, classes, workshops, kids' programs, an artists in residence program, production support and a wide range of performances to the community.</p>
<p><strong><u>Where your money will go:</u></strong></p>
<p><u>Aerial Rigging</u>: This is no small feat, we want to make sure it is safe for everyone who chooses to participate in an aerial performances or class. We are working with very qualified rigging team who are donating their time and skills to get the space rigged for Aerial. Even with their affordable rates for helping the space, it is going to cost at least $17,000 for rigging safely and the additional construction fees to finish the space! </p>
<p><u>Education on Safety and Standards for our Teachers and Staff:</u> It is truly important to have the whole Staff be on the same page regarding use of the space and equipment regardless discipline. Our plan is to develop a standardized set of operating procedures for our fully functioning New Orleans circus space. We will of course also want all of our instructors to have first aid training and certifications as well and be sure that we create a safe space for our artists and the community at large. We also want to send our Director of Circus programming to the National Circus Educators Conference this fall (<a href=""http://www.americancircuseducators.org)!The%C2%A0educational"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.americancircuseducators.org</a>) The program for all of our teachers and staff  will cost approximately $2,000.</p>
<p><u>Equipment</u>: We wish to have classes is a wide range of circus skills: juggling, aerial, Cyr wheel, German wheel, object manipulation, fire props, stilt walking, walking globe, hand balancing, acrobatics, tit wire, pole and hooping. All these classes need support equipment to facilitate them. Unfortunately proper circus equipment is not cheap, but we are doing our best to be savvy with the funds in order to accommodate all of these circus art forms as well as equipment wear and tear over the first year. We will, of course, need crash mats as well to make sure that we are safely learning our new skills. $11,000</p>
<p><u>First Year Operating Costs</u>: Our location is everything; our space is everything. The high ceilings, rigging capabilities and large room allows us to have two classes at once in a neighborhood where many people can bike over and participate. All of these amazing benefits come with a cost. Just heating and cooling the building alone is pricey. Funding for staff salaries, day to day operational costs and marketing promotions over our first year would allow us to focus on cultivating future student populations and audiences for our productions originating at Sanctuary.  $36,000</p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>The Impact</u></h3>
<p>Circus at Sanctuary is a valuable asset to New Orleans and nationally. It provides a space where students, performers, artists and collaborators of all kinds can participate and grow in their art forms! This type of creative hub doesn't exist in New Orleans and by its existence: the magic of Circus, Multimedia Theater, and performance art can add to the beautiful culture of our wonderful city, New Orleans!  </p>
</div><div>
<h3><u>Risks &amp; Challenges</u></h3>
<p>We are taking a great leap of faith based on years of the growing New Circus movement of New Orleans in order to have an inclusive space and home for the Performing Arts. Our bills are already stacking up and we need to have revenue to start. There are currently circus classes and workshops available in the space that can be facilitated with the minimal personal equipment on loan by teachers and through donation, but this is not sustainable. Personal equipment is neccessary for teachers' and artists' own work. This campaign, should it be successful, will provide the tools needed to facilitate all activities Sanctuary dreams to have. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>My name is Marco Antonio Gonzales and I come from a small town in deep south Texas. As a kid my mind drifted in the fields always looking up at the clouds and having a deep yearning to be something else. In my  early to mid-20 a series events set me on a path that would change me forever and as I struggled in this time period I fell back on the constructs of my Youth, but my connection to these personas was stronger than I had imagined. As I would find out more than a decade later.</li>
<li>My campaign is about helping individuals who are on a self destructive path, understand and accept the inner self, the one that we hide. It is important to me on a humanitarian level to see people get the most out of their lives and not feel cornered by societal pressures to be something they don't want to be. Sadly some people don't figure this out until they are too old to do anything about it and they struggle as they realize most of their life was wasted trying to live up to the unspoken expectations of those in our everyday lives. This documentary will be entered into the 2017 SXSW Film Festival as full length feature film. </li>
<li>Truly the world is changing. So much light has been shed on many other topics and yet there are many individuals still out there who still feel marginalized and without a voice. I can't reach them all, but I can reach those like myself who are goodhearted people and generally want to do good things and help people. The problem with individuals like myself is that we held onto an idea of what was expected out of us whether it be the virtues we wanted to see in ourselves or striving for Altruism, because we did not feel there was any other real purpose for our lives. As the years go by, we find that real life is nothing like this, and this is when our schema of the world around us begins to unravel as mine did over a year ago. Suicide prevention through education, and helping people avoid destructive behavior patterns, I would have to say is what I am trying to accomplish here. I want to encourage healthy ways of dealing with dissociation, for me it is not so important that it looks normal but that it helps with suffering and is a positive form of therapy for an individual to see where all these ailments of the mind are coming from. For instance I took up modern abstract dancing again after a decade and designed masks to symbolize my childhood constructs as a form of exposure therapy to address my false beliefs about myself. This has been therapeutic and helpful and as the weeks go by I feel more and more distance growing between me and these personas. My example is only one of many in this documentary.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>I am requiring $5500 dollars to complete this documentary, roughly 3500 of this will be for a better camera  and accessories that records at a higher quality meaning a better quality film (4K). $2000 of this is for traveling expenses for interviews, production of the film after complete, film  and a few other things such as video clips from adobe archives, film permits (only some have fees) and printing legal forms (consent forms, data collection), producing of DVD and Memorabilia (Perks).  </li>
<li>For those who contribute $5 will get a digital copy of the film for download and if you contribute more than $15 they will get both a digital copy of this movie and the physical DVD which will have bonus footage and the backstory and a more in depth look at the research revolving around these topics today. For those who donate more than $25 they will get the both copies of the movie and a Movie Poster!</li>
<li>If I don't reach my goal I will used the funds that I do receive to put towards the camera.</li>
<li>I have pretty much used every paycheck that comes my way to put into this, but it is not enough to have this ready in the time span that needs to be met.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>I think the best way I can describe the impact of all of this, is to point out that sometimes because of our ambiguity and even hindered personalities, individuals like myself constantly go misunderstood throughout the decades. Furthermore sometimes our personality types are closely related to that of a narcissistic nature and therefore require larger amounts of compassion to have empathy for. Again I point out that so much positive impact has come to other groups who have been oppressed and mistreated, but when it comes to the mentally ill or people with cognitive disorders or even personality disorders, these are still issues that people distance themselves from, because of hard set stigma. It is a hard dilemma to deal with as a society mostly due to the fact that as a society there is still so much we do not understand about the human mind and variations in personality. My hope is that this documentary can help with that.</li>
<li>Mental illness has always been something I have been around since my youth. Coming from a border town where there is great social stratification our MHMR facilities are overwhelmed and under budgeted. When I moved to Austin I immediately noticed the correlation between the homeless and mental illness. This is why I have launched the Dancer in the Dark Project which is still falling into place, Dancer in the Dark is an even larger project in which the ""Be My Eyes"" Documentary has branched off from.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul><li>I will be honest with you this has been extremely hard for me to put forth. It was started when I was in between jobs and doing very labor intensive work out in the Texas heat. The nature of what I am doing has brought into questioned my sexuality, my masculinity and sanity. This has been an uncomfortable experience to say the least. However I do my best to remain confident and enthused about what I am doing because the truth is I am having a really great time doing it. It does hurt to see that some people in this world that I care for and respect very much, don't look at me the same and give off a sense that they are embarrassed of me, but again I will not stop until its enough and its no where near enough. My hopes are that one day something like this documentary could come out and relate this topic to more people in a way that would remove stereotypes and stigmas and bring people closer together.  </li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<ul>
<li>If you are unable to contribute money there are other ways you can help, I am still looking for people who have had identity issues or maybe not, basically anyone who just wants to speak their mind on camera and perhaps it could be a story on the documentary that helps someone out there struggling with the same situation.</li>
<li>Please share this Documentary Film Campaign with others on social media, thank you everyone, be safe, be happy, be yourselves!</li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am Rusty Rhodes, a pastor, educator, filmmaker, and president of the Christian Youth Film Society. I've teamed up with Joe Brown, Executive Director, and Scott Garcia, Board Member/Mentor, with a mission to influence our culture for the better. We have dedicated ourselves to equip the next generation of filmmakers who are loyal to Jesus, pursue truth with vigor, and create narrative art that honors the author of life and reality. We want to see talented young people sharpen their craft of great storytelling and enter the culture to create positive changes for Christ. Our current project will begin production during our 2016 Making Movie Makers for Christ Film Camp. The movie, a comedy-western entitled ""Treasure Hunt,"" will be used to train young people behind and in front of the camera, give opportunities for discipleship, and produce a lasting product that thousands of families will enjoy! You can be a part of something that has lasting influence!</p>
<p>The story is about Lily and Earnest O'Brien who are in financial trouble because of Lily's get-rich-quick schemes. So even though Lily hates her cousin Sadie, when Sadie offers a chance to find a hidden stash of wealth they make an uneasy alliance and face danger in the desert. The movie explores the theme offered by Jesus in Matthew 6:19-20, ""Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth where moth and rust corrupt and where thieves break in and steal. But lay up for yourselves treasures in Heaven.""</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>There are many people volunteering their time and talent to this production. But that doesn't negate many costs associated with a production like this. We need $9750 to cover costuming, makeup, props, sets and set dressing, some equipment rentals, location scouting, transportation to five different locales, the food and boarding of horses and people, and expendables. </p>
<p>All those who donate $25 or more will receive a free download of our recent project FOUR HUNDRED NINETY-ONE. </p>
<p>All those who donate $50 or more will receive the FOUR HUNDRED NINETY-ONE download and a free TREASURE HUNT download after its June 2017 premiere. </p>
<p>All those who donate $75 or more will receive the above two free downloads and two free tickets to the premiere of TREASURE HUNT. </p>
<p>All those who donate $100 or more will receive the two free downloads, two free premiere tickets, and their names in the credit roll of the movie. </p>
<p>All funds raised will go to the successful production of TREASURE HUNT</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We are about making a difference in the lives of young people who will then make a positive difference in our world! While we help them develop their talents for Jesus we want to develop their character as well. The final product will be something you'll be proud to have been a part of. But there is intrinsic and eternal rewards  as well as we influence lives for the sake of Christ!</p>
<p>The Christian Youth Film Society has mentored young men and women who are now working in Hollywood and in their churches -- using their talent to glorify God! We've inspired teens for 23 years and this is one more opportunity to join us in this mission</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Making a movie is a difficult task. Making a <strong>great</strong> movie takes a herculean effort! Our pre-production continues to be thorough. But the logistics of shooting in the beautiful environs of the Alabama Hills, Mojave Desert, and the valley and foothills of Kern County over several months will bring unexpected challenges. We have built a team -- and are expanding that team -- to make this project a success. We have been successful with 23 years of festivals, multiple film camps, several workshops, and other productions. We are privileged to work with positive people who bring their best and simply persevere until we succeed.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We will have many needs as we progress through this project that are beyond financial. Already, many have stepped up and volunteered and/or loaned their expertise, services, and property to make us a success. Stay connected on Facebook (The Treasure Hunt Project) and/or twitter (@rustywriter2) to see how you can help.</p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Dr. Tamara Pizzoli. I'm a children’s literature author, art curator, and producer who was born and raised in Texas and has lived in Rome for over a decade. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559186213/mdyjsmw9ci4oje7dowkc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>As a former kindergarten teacher, I have a particular love for stories, and for the past few years I've dedicated my personal and professional life to storytelling through producing quality content across various mediums. Though I love making documentaries and web series, my greatest passion is writing and publishing books for children via my publishing house, The English Schoolhouse (theenglishschoolhouse.com).</p>
<p>Since beginning to write full-time in 2014, I've penned and published fifteen titles (and counting), and I've been fortunate to have my books featured on several prominent platforms including My Brown Baby, HuffPost, and Afropunk regularly.</p>
<p>In 2016, I self-published <i>Tallulah the Tooth Fairy CEO</i>. One year later the title was signed to the premiere imprint Farrar Straus and Giroux at MacMillan. And on International Women’s Day this year it was announced that Tallulah the Tooth Fairy CEO had been optioned to be made into a live-action film produced by Gabrielle Union and John Sacchi, the former Vice President of Lionsgate. </p>
<p><a href=""https://deadline.com/2019/03/gabrielle-union-5-minutes-more-bite-on-tallulah-the-tooth-fairy-ceo-yamara-taylor-to-adapt-kids-book-into-movie-1202572317/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://deadline.com/2019/03/gabrielle-union-5-...</a></p>
<p>The book has also received a significant literary nod, a Kirkus starred review, in which it was deemed ""funny and provocative"". </p>
<p><a href=""https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/tamara-pizzoli/tallulah-the-tooth-fairy-ceo/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/tama...</a></p>
<p>I'm thrilled that Tallulah the Tooth Fairy CEO is already creating such a significant amount of buzz. Here we have a Black tooth fairy who is a mogul, sports an afro, frequents museums and has a board of directors. I believe both the text and imagery are the type of quality fiction all children should be exposed to early and often. </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559185837/dbhkikuhmzzkunhigc3u.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I've set a goal to ensure that the story of Tallulah the Tooth Fairy CEO ends up in as many hands and hearts as possible this summer. I'm setting out on a book tour with my assistant and will be visiting many cities on the east coast and in the south starting on the book’s rerelease date, July 30. I would love your support to make the tour, and Tallulah, a huge success.</p>
<p>Books like Tallulah have large societal implications and relevance. Here are some alarming statistics regarding representation in the world of children’s literature:</p>
<p>-Only 7% of new children’s literature in 2017 were written by Black, Latinx or Native authors.</p>
<p>-In 2018, the CLPE in the UK found that only 1% of children’s books depicted a main character who was Black or minority ethnic.</p>
<p>It’s not enough to simply be aware of these stats. When we are presented with individuals who are working steadily to make a difference, we hold a powerful position to assist in active problem-solving. The answer seems clear to me: we need <strong>more</strong>—more presence, creation, and support.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559186501/n0mhwafovlisvst7wdwz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>So here's the goal: 20K in 20 Days. </strong></p>
<p>Say it with me. 20K in 20 Days.</p>
<p>We can do this! We gotta do this!</p>
<p>Here's why--</p>
<p>The funds raised will assist with travel and lodging, transportation, book purchases and deliveries, marketing and appearances at festivals, museums and bookstores. Festival appearances in particular cost a pretty penny. We will be at Afropunk in Brooklyn as well as at the Essence Festival in July (stop by our table and say hello if you're attending either or both!)</p>
<p>And should we (fingers crossed) exceed the goal, we can add more cities to our tour schedule, print and manufacture fun freebies for kids, like buttons and stickers and bookmarks, and visit summer and charter schools with books in hand.</p>
<p>We welcome support and contributions from individuals, small businesses, and large corporations.</p>
<p>This week we secured our first corporate sponsor, the fashion house Stella Jean Roma (it's also my favorite brand).</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1559187814/uhlwjexvlzyzksglngma.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>So here are the PERKS:</p>
<p>First and most important, you'll be supporting multicultural content and positive imagery. You'll be contributing to what kids deserve--more great stories that they can see themselves and others in. And you'll be assisting in helping to get the word out about a wonderful book that deserves to be on top (Tallulah's words...not mine).</p>
<p>$25 or greater</p>

<p>Arduino is the world’s most popular open-source electronics tool, used every day by millions of people for experimenting and learning electronics. Thanks to the support of the maker community, anyone can share their knowledge and learn from thousands of other projects. You can create anything using basic components like switches and LEDs, or more advanced components like digital interfaces and wireless communication modules. The only limit is your imagination!</p>
<p>Makers around the world have asked themselves the same question: where do I find reliable and easy to use circuit diagrams for my projects? I've spent years tinkering and making stuff with Arduino, ARM mbed, ESP8266, etc and one of the things that always annoyed was how difficult it was to find reliable, simple to read and aesthetically pleasing circuit diagrams, reference tables and pinouts.</p>
<p>Back in 2013 I began designing my own and making them available for free on my website <a href=""http://www.pighixxx.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">pighixxx.com</a>. I have created so far more than 300 high quality circuit diagrams and pinouts that are used by more than 500,000 makers worldwide. The feedback from the community has been amazing and it has encouraged me to create more and more content. The only problem is that they're not very convenient to use on your computer screen where the programming environment should be the main open window. Also, printing the diagrams can only add more clutter to your desk.</p>
<p>We've been working hard for the past months to deliver a great product that will solve these problems.</p>

<p>The first pre-release units were delivered to us by our manufacturing partner a couple of weeks ago and I must say they look amazing! The pictures don't do justice to how great it looks and feels. Bear in mind that these pre-release copies were printed using digital printing technology. Also, the colors may look duller due to the color grading applied to the pictures. The books will be printed using offset printing technology, achieving much more vibrant colors and professional quality results!</p>
<p>We want to support local manufacturing in Spain, that's why we partnered with a printing company that has been making high quality print media for more than 35 years in the south of Madrid. By doing this, we can also reduce lead times for manufacturing and shipping, and oversee the full production to ensure that the book will meet our strict quality standards.</p>

<p>The book is currently undergoing a thorough review process. With the feedback we're receiving from our reviewers, plus your feedback during the campaign, we will be able to have the book ready by the end of the campaign. Our manufacturing partner will be notified in advance and the manufacturing process will begin right after the campaign ends. We are confident that all rewards will be shipped in August.</p>
<p>Shipping will be done with one fo the best global fulfilment companies. We're doing everything we can to offer affordable shipping to all of you, but unfortunately it's not easy to do it for some countries, considering the complexity of the logistics and that the book weighs almost 1kg. ABC: Basic Connections will be shipped from the US to our US backers.</p>
<p>Back in 2013 and thanks to more than 2800 backers on Indiegogo, I was able deliver more than 4000 units of ABC: The Book around the world. Unfortunately, no more copies were printed after the campaign.</p>
<p>ABC: Basic Connections features a completely redesigned version of each circuit diagram found in the 2013 edition of ABC, plus many more unreleased designs. More than 100 sheets (200+ pages!), more than double compared to the 2013 edition of ABC.</p>

However, will be overseeing the manufacturing process actively to make sure everything is done according to our specifications. ;)</p>
<p>Back in 2013 and thanks to more than 2800 backers on Indiegogo, I was able deliver more than 4000 units of ABC: The Book around the world swiftly and hassle-free. For this campaign, lead times will be shorter and everything will be under our direct supervision.</p>
<p>In order to make this book affordable enough, we need to print at least 2000 copies. Printing in Europe is more expensive than doing it in China, we need your help to keep the costs low, please share this campaign with your friends and colleagues and help us spread the word!! :D</p>
<p>With your feedback, we can make the book even better! Please send us your comments at feedback@abcthebook.com</p>
<p>If the campaign is successful, I will be dedicating much more time to making more and more content. Thank you very much to all of you for supporting the creation of more circuit diagrams and pinouts for the past years! </p>

</div></div>","Arduino is the world’s most popular open-source electronics tool, used every day by millions of people for experimenting and learning electronics. Thanks to the support of the maker community, anyone can share their knowledge and learn from thousands of other projects. You can create anything using basic components like switches and LEDs, or more advanced components like digital interfaces and wireless communication modules. The only limit is your imagination!
Makers around the world have asked themselves the same question: where do I find reliable and easy to use circuit diagrams for my projects? I've spent years tinkering and making stuff with Arduino, ARM mbed, ESP8266, etc and one of the things that always annoyed was how difficult it was to find reliable, simple to read and aesthetically pleasing circuit diagrams, reference tables and pinouts.
Back in 2013 I began designing my own and making them available for free on my website pighixxx.com. I have created so far more than 300 high quality circuit diagrams and pinouts that are used by more than 500,000 makers worldwide. The feedback from the community has been amazing and it has encouraged me to create more and more content. The only problem is that they're not very convenient to use on your computer screen where the programming environment should be the main open window. Also, printing the diagrams can only add more clutter to your desk.
We've been working hard for the past months to deliver a great product that will solve these problems.
ABC: Basic Connections
 

ABC: Basic Connections is a completely redesigned selection of the best circuit diagrams, reference tables and pinouts from pighixxx.com, plus many new unreleased designs.
The book is a collection of neat, easy to read circuit diagrams and pinouts that will show you how to properly connect almost anything to your Arduino, ARM mbed or ESP8266, etc. compatible boards. ABC: Basic Connections is great for both beginners and professionals and it can be used as a resource for teaching electronics.

<div>Jacksonville, NC is a young community with many military families.  These families sacrifice so much for our country and the museum would be a great asset for them. The military population is young and their children need a place like Zing Zumm. The museum would serve as a place to have fun and forget the stresses associated with having parents deployed and serving in other capacities.</div>
<div>Along with our young families, many of our citizens are retired veterans living on a very limited fixed income thus our opportunities for fundraising can be very challenging.<br/>

The museum would serve as a place to have fun and forget the stresses associated with having parents deployed and serving in other capacities.
Along with our young families, many of our citizens are retired veterans living on a very limited fixed income thus our opportunities for fundraising can be very challenging.



Camp Lejeune and the New River Air Station  is home to an active duty, dependent , retiree and civilian employee population of approximately  190,000.



49% of households have at least 1 child under 18

13th largest city in North Carolina

Housing Education Workshops<br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Adequate shelter is foundational for
individuals to build a dignified human life. With secure and stable housing,
individuals are more likely to contribute to a region’s economic growth, pursue
education, build a solid family structure, obtain better personal health, and
experience a higher quality of life. A significant barrier to adequate shelter
is lack of educational services for homeless individuals or individuals at-risk
of becoming homeless. To address this barrier, the London Housing Registry has
designed a Housing Education Workshop and are seeking funds to begin the
implementation of these workshops across London communities.</p>

Our Impact
</h3> <p></p>
<p>Your funding will allow Housing
Education Workshops to run once a month for approximately 12 months. Each hour
and a half long workshop will consist of a lecture portion and a question and
answer period. These interactive workshops will host 10 to 20 individuals per
workshop and will cater to a variety of populations facing barriers to maintaining adequate
housing. These populations include but are not limited to first time renters,
individuals with no established credit or who cannot supply a cosigner,
individuals who struggle with financial literacy, and those who have difficulty
managing roommate relationships.</p>
<p>Workshops will follow a detailed program
with topics that include tenant rights and responsibilities in accordance with
the Residential Tenancies Act, how to fill a rental
application, what to look for when viewing an apartment, housing options, fire safety, how to stretch
a dollar, apartment insurance, city
by-laws, landlord responsibilities, avoiding eviction, understanding lease
agreements, roommate accord and agreements, pet care skills, cleaning your
apartment, recycling, and personal safety.</p>

<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">I like many of you are fascinated about the prospect of raising fresh young and youthful leaders. Every time I remember the pain parents, guardians, friends or even donors go through in raising money to educate children hoping one day they will graduate to help them, their own siblings, communities, countries and the world at large, I forced to share the little I have to help. I am not yet a parent so I may not know exactly how painful it is to sacrifice everything you have to give your loved one education but I know what it feels like to have creative mind and dreams that you can't realize because you have no starting point or anyone to help you shape your dreams. </span></p>

Indeed the <a href=""http://globalnutritionreport.org/2014/11/13/global-nutrition-report-2014/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Global Nutrition Report 2014</a> called for  the recognition, supporting and expanding the number of national nutrition champions as one of the ten actions to accelerate the world's progress on nutrition.  At the Innovation Centre we are more concerned about creating great leaders, champions of change and critical thinkers so they can create more  young and energetic leaders. The first lot of the youth are getting special and intense training as leaders who will eventually become mentors and coaches for the younger youth enrolled in the centre. Each of them will recruit, mentor and help at least five younger ones with start up or incorporate them into existing teams. There is no better way to help change future leaders than by engaging those who have walked in their own shoes. Today I am a joyous and selfless young leader greatly because <b><a href=""http://www.fhi360.org/experts/robert-mwadime-phd-msc"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Dr. Robert Mwadime</a></b> and other selfless leaders have invested their time in mentoring me. I am certain Dr. Mwadime and others who are still alive to see their fruits mature are the happiest people and can gracefully retire without regret. Not many of the young professionals have such opportunities these days. Seeing the positive change in the first lot of the youth in the centre, I like others who have visited the centre are more than certain the approach taken in the centre will surely create more social change champions and creative leaders!</div>

<h3>
<span style=""color: rgb(0, 0, 0); letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">How is the centre changing the world today?</span><br/>
</h3>
<p>In October 2014, I used my savings to rent a house to host the centre. I and a colleague (Fred) started using our evenings and weekends to mentor the youth on key technical and soft skills. As result they have developed business and social ideas among which is the <a href=""https://openideo.com/challenge/zero-to-five/top-ideas/solve-two-legumes-one-cereal-meal-for-smart-children"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Promoting Local Nutrition Solutions</a> which won the second Amplify Challenge in OpenIDEO.  Other ideas being prototyped include <b>CityBorn project, Mushroom project, Nutrition Business Process Outsourcing for hospitals, Nutrition Studio and Sustainable School feeding project</b> (See the image below). Seeing these youth progressing professionally and socially through increased self confidence, self-esteem, creativity and other soft skills that they did not get in University and the continued requests by others still in university and other unemployed graduates confirms the centre is worth more and will contribute to addressing global social change challenges. While others are mainly focusing on creating jobs for the youth, we are concerned about imparting the ideology of social change and unique leadership to our young youth so they grow to help others to help more communities. These youth and the centre are indeed destined to change the world one step at a time. </p>

Unlike me today  about 20% of nutritionists who make it through universities get employed in Uganda. With high University admissions for nutrition, getting mentors for each student is impossible. I know of several unemployed professionals with substantial experience gained from the street who can make good mentors but lack the necessary leadership and attitude. I am leading this campaign because I want these great young men and women to take the button from me and reach out to other younger future leaders and champions of change.

<p><i>I have worked as a graphics designer but dropped the boss and went freelance after graduating a nutritionist and failing to get employed in the field for lack of experience. Along the way I met Jamiru, my classmate and close friend at university who introduced me to this group of young, motivated and determined colleagues at the Innovation Center. I
fitted in the team well and my best passion is that I get to put my graphics knowledge to use in health promotion, something I have always considered but was figuring out how. I am currently developing the <b>Nutrition Studio</b>, a media project highly based on nutrition and health concepts affecting most of us and our relatives.

</div></div>","A mind of a graduate is a terrible thing to waste!
Please help us raise $ 7,431 to support these young graduates retain where they can converge to innovate life impacting ideas. The Innovation Center is a  business and leadership focused mentorship program to support fresh and young graduates realize their dreams and contribute to improving social, economic and health welfare of the society. 
I am Alex Mokori, during the week I work as a Program Manager in an NGO in Uganda but during the last 12 months, I have spent most of my free time serving as a volunteer mentor and building a program to support  young graduates who want to pursue social entrepreneurship in Uganda. 
I like many of you are fascinated about the prospect of raising fresh young and youthful leaders. Every time I remember the pain parents, guardians, friends or even donors go through in raising money to educate children hoping one day they will graduate to help them, their own siblings, communities, countries and the world at large, I forced to share the little I have to help. I am not yet a parent so I may not know exactly how painful it is to sacrifice everything you have to give your loved one education but I know what it feels like to have creative mind and dreams that you can't realize because you have no starting point or anyone to help you shape your dreams. 
Picture the parents of these impoverished children living deep in Amuria district in Uganda sacrificing everything they got to educate their sons and daughters hoping one day they will save their village when after University. Do you know how much trauma those parents have when those children graduate to unemployment and eventually to alcoholism, HIV and accidents due to frustrations?
 
You my friends are changing the world of these fresh graduates, their families and generations to come. I am sure the Innovation Centre will forever groom creative young change agents and innovators who'll contribute to solving one of the most painful social challenges of the 21st century: increased low self esteem due to unemployment.

The world needs social change champions NOW
Social change champions and creative thinkers are in short supply today. Indeed the Global Nutrition Report 2014 called for  the recognition, supporting and expanding the number of national nutrition champions as one of the ten actions to accelerate the world's progress on nutrition.  At the Innovation Centre we are more concerned about creating great leaders, champions of change and critical thinkers so they can create more  young and energetic leaders. The first lot of the youth are getting special and intense training as leaders who will eventually become mentors and coaches for the younger youth enrolled in the centre. Each of them will recruit, mentor and help at least five younger ones with start up or incorporate them into existing teams. There is no better way to help change future leaders than by engaging those who have walked in their own shoes. Today I am a joyous and selfless young leader greatly because Dr. Robert Mwadime and other selfless leaders have invested their time in mentoring me. I am certain Dr. Mwadime and others who are still alive to see their fruits mature are the happiest people and can gracefully retire without regret. Not many of the young professionals have such opportunities these days. Seeing the positive change in the first lot of the youth in the centre, I like others who have visited the centre are more than certain the approach taken in the centre will surely create more social change champions and creative leaders!



...But there is a small challenge to address





The rent for meeting and working space for the youth runs
out in two months; the team lacks soft-and technical skills manuals and senior mentors to actively and continuously help them. The team is seeking your support  so they can retain the working space. With $ 5,000 the centre will have rent for the next 12 months. An additional  $ 4,000 will see the team successfully launch the technical and soft skills  training program, reach out to at least 30 other smart, educated and unemployed youth, create employment for others while positively changing lives of many other people in different communities in Uganda. Through this initial support, the youth expect to create business projects which will sustain the centre with minimum or no reliance on donation.



When you help the centre stay alive, you will:

 


Join other global selfless people who have chosen to be dream makers, heroes and someone
who is allowing emerging creative talents to change Uganda for decades to come.


To keep you reminded of your heroic contribution to the world, the youth will provide you  beautiful  Ugandan art pieces, t-shirts, certificates, personalised thank you messages and links to the centre's progress. Our highest contributors will receive specially produced video of the unique features and people that make Uganda the Pearl of Africa.  See the designs below:

How did it start?
Like other NGO employees, I am
constantly approached by young graduates for employment. I wish I could give
them the jobs but I don’t where they can buy the required experience. In June-September 2014,  I started evening and weekend meetings with 15 youth who had graduated two years ago but did not have jobs. The goal of the meetings was to catalyze thoughts on how best these youth could pool own knowledge and skills to generate income through viable ideas such as nutrition process business outsourcing for hospitals, urban farming, design and development of creative communication materials and and  other social change enterprises. The youth agreed to start an innovation centre. In 2014 while doing an online course-How to change the World, prof. Michael B. Roth shared the upcoming youth employment challenge by Clinton Global Initiative and OpenIDEO, I submitted the idea to the platform and it won the challenge. 








How is the centre changing the world today?

In October 2014, I used my savings to rent a house to host the centre. I and a colleague (Fred) started using our evenings and weekends to mentor the youth on key technical and soft skills. As result they have developed business and social ideas among which is the Promoting Local Nutrition Solutions which won the second Amplify Challenge in OpenIDEO.  Other ideas being prototyped include CityBorn project, Mushroom project, Nutrition Business Process Outsourcing for hospitals, Nutrition Studio and Sustainable School feeding project (See the image below). Seeing these youth progressing professionally and socially through increased self confidence, self-esteem, creativity and other soft skills that they did not get in University and the continued requests by others still in university and other unemployed graduates confirms the centre is worth more and will contribute to addressing global social change challenges. While others are mainly focusing on creating jobs for the youth, we are concerned about imparting the ideology of social change and unique leadership to our young youth so they grow to help others to help more communities. These youth and the centre are indeed destined to change the world one step at a time. 


What social and economic challenges is the centre solving?

Uganda
has the world’s highest population of young people under 30 years — 78 percent.
The country also boasts of the high youth unemployment in Africa at 62 — 83
percent. It is estimated
40,000 graduates are passed out of Ugandan universities each year, but only
8,000 or 20 percent get jobs. 

International Labour Organization blames
unemployment of graduates on the mismatch between the skills the graduates get with what the market demands.
Lack of guidance at home and university,
absence of role models and mentors for inspiration and guidance; lack
self-confidence and other soft skills make today’s youth more
vulnerable in spite of acquiring lots of technical skills. 

This is where the Innovation Centre comes in. The youth will recruit younger youth who are in vocational institutes and Universities into the leadership and mentorship program where they will receive training on soft skills for a year. As they undergo training on soft skills and social change mentorship, they also receive support to nurture social change and business ideas so that by the time they complete studies they can launch their start-ups. 


Each viable idea will have its own team members with a leader who will run it as an independent project with direct benefit to the community. Because employers, business companies, teaching institutions, development partners and youth will work as partners, the centre will continue transforming dreams of the youth into highly demanded solutions to community needs.





What risks are we anticipating?



The young graduates could get frustrated because the ideas are not translating into direct social and economic impact within a short period of time
The companies and NGOs we anticipate partnering with to provide more hands on experience for the recruited youth in the centre could fail to take them up and provide guided mentorship
The centre may become too small for the youth within two years yet the rent within the central district is too expensive to afford
Non-response from senior mentors to support the youth in the centre due to the centre's inability to financially compensate them for their time
Our greatest fear is not the failure to mentor the youth but ensuring their start-ups succeed and create social change impact.



How else can you help US?




Any help in form of partnerships, gifts in kind, technical materials, design support, online mentorship and connections to those who believe in our dream. Some times the smallest of the actions matter most. 


Mentoring on how to be an independent consultant to NGOs, how to develop expertise that can be packaged into a training to generate income, how to do focus groups so they can contract with organizations, how to conduct ideation sessions so they can sell those services to others, etc

Pick any of the current ideas and link to companies, customers and other stakeholders who can help the youth through buying the products or services.

Why am I doing this?


             Alex Mokori, volunteer youth mentor



 I am a volunteer mentor, a social entrepreneur and a chief dream seller  to the youth in the Innovation Centre but I work in an NGO. For the past one year I have spent my free time online communities of social entrepreneurs such as OpenIDEO to design  ideas to help the smart unemployed youth in Uganda who look up to me for mentorship. I prefer to call myself a dreamer who dreams his pictures at night and paints them early in the morning. I am so passionate about creating empowered and critical thinking young leaders that I spend most of my spare time reaching out to them. I am always prepared to volunteer and listen to a young person so as to understand better their dreams and hopes. I believe to change the world and make it better for all, we need to create a generation of passionate leaders with a big heart for people.When I joined University
to study Human Nutrition in Tanzania in 2003, I was not sure where I would get a
job in this field. In August 2003 during holidays, I attended Uganda Nutrition
Action for Nutrition (UGAN) meeting in Kampala where Dr. Robert Mwadime delivered a key note address. 


By all means he made  me realize there is light at the end of my University studies. I approached him and asked him to mentor me.He did not reject and has continued holding my hands till today. I got my first job through him and are currently where I am because of his sacrifices. Unlike me today  about 20% of nutritionists who make it through universities get employed in Uganda. With high University admissions for nutrition, getting mentors for each student is impossible. I know of several unemployed professionals with substantial experience gained from the street who can make good mentors but lack the necessary leadership and attitude. I am leading this campaign because I want these great young men and women to take the button from me and reach out to other younger future leaders and champions of change. Today I call upon all of you irrespective of where you are to rally behind these youth and help change the leadership, mentorship and business landscape for young people in Uganda. You will forever feel you shared what you have to keep the dreams of these young people alive.

                Michael Senyonjo, Knowledge and Design Manager



I have worked as a graphics designer but dropped the boss and went freelance after graduating a nutritionist and failing to get employed in the field for lack of experience. Along the way I met Jamiru, my classmate and close friend at university who introduced me to this group of young, motivated and determined colleagues at the Innovation Center. I
fitted in the team well and my best passion is that I get to put my graphics knowledge to use in health promotion, something I have always considered but was figuring out how. I am currently developing the Nutrition Studio, a media project highly based on nutrition and health concepts affecting most of us and our relatives. This is an awesome opportunity and a fun place to be as I am sharing my design expertise while getting mentored on more technical and soft skills. 

Shakira Nabawanga, Operations Manager 

 I was working as an administrator before joining the centre having failed to get a job in my profession for over 2 years of searching. I thank all my colleagues whom I thought along with in creating this centre. I
have always wanted to practice my profession but had no opportunity now with innovation centre am starting to realize my dream.  

Josephine Murungi, Strategic Information Manager





I was frustrated with job hunting which I did
for almost a year and was home before I was invited to join the Innovation centre by a colleague, I had no idea about what I was to do but I had the passion and enthusiasm
like most youth. Now, I am being mentored and gaining skills in Monitoring and Evaluation and I am part of a team of youth that are creative and innovative. I feel every youth should have an opportunity to be part of this.

Racheal Natumanya, Community Nutritionist



Life is a journey that everyone has to make. It comes with challenges, easy parts, lessons to learn and above all decisions to make. Joining the Innovation Center was a decision that has led me to achieving my dream of  creativity and realized the potential in me through the mentorship and guidance I get every single day. I would regret ever missing this opportunity. Before joining the centre I was seated home awaiting for internship opportunities in NGOs.

“Our vision is to make Spring Dales Public School one of the finest so our children can receive quality education right at their doorstep, without facing emotional separation from their parents and their village.""
Tsewang Norboo, Principal of SDPS
 
Where is Spring Dales Public School?
Spring Dales Public School (SDPS) is located in the village of Mulbekh which is located in the Himalayan area of Ladakh (""land of high passes"")- in the state of Jammu and Kashmir in northwestern India. Mulbekh is a treacherous seven hour drive from the state capital of Leh.
 What are the challenges to education in Ladakh?In 2010, we (Martin and Kate) were fortunate to establish a close relationship and collaboration with Mr. Tsewang Norboo, the Principal of Spring Dales Public School (SDPS). In his small village of Mulbekh we heard him speak passionately about the unique culture, language and identities of a traditional Tibetan Buddhist society that is struggling to educate their children in this harshly remote Himalayan region.The more Principal Norboo explained his community's deep concern that the exodus of young people being educated elsewhere is threatening the future of their community, the more we felt compelled to lend our skills to the community in any way they needed.Please take a few moments to watch these brief clips that effectively highlight the significant challenges to remote traditional Tibetan Buddhist societies, like Mulbekh, and the effects of children being educated so far away from their families and communities (Zanskar valley is close to the Mulbekh valley):  Mountains: The most dangerous school run in the world (Human Planet, BBC, 2011).

Original trailer for a film called Journey from Zanskar (Warrior Films, 2010)
 
What is the community's solution?The Mulbekh community has an ambitious and bold solution to lower the exodus of young people from their remote region.Providing equal access to quality, local education means the region's children and youth don't have to leave their parents, siblings, grandparents, families and communities for larger centres elsewhere in India. By slowing this mass exodus, and by providing a school curriculum that emphasizes a blend of traditional and modern education, the sharing of knowledge between generations is able to flourish.  All of this directly supports the revitalization and vitality of the unique Ladakhi culture, traditions, language, Buddhist faith, local economies, and identities.Building a quality school campus (including student accommodation) for the region will attract more students to be educated locally. This will dramatically slow the region's exodus of young people to larger centres, and will also attract quality, permanent teachers, thus lowering the high teacher turnover, while increasing stability for the students.Given the harsh climate - where temperatures can rise to 30+ degrees celsius in the summer and drop to -30 in the winter with no heating system - passive solar and rammed earth technologies were chosen as they use local materials and provide unprecedented year-round comfort. Students will no longer have to take their classes sitting outside on the ground in the winter (inside is too frigid to hold a pencil)! The old classrooms are so cold and dark that classes are often taught outside in the colder months.SDPS Class 10 student being recognized for academic achievement with her classmates looking on. Assemblies are held outside in the colder months as indoors is too cold. What we have accomplished
Secured funding from His Holiness the  14th Dalai Lama and The Dalai Lama Trust

New student accommodation block finished in 2014 

Solar plant built in 2011 - (the only building in the region with 24h electricity!)
Internet connection since 2011 (first building in the region with internet!)
Infrastructure Development Plan created between 2010-2013
Long and Short-term School Development and Action Plan formulated in 2011
SDPS Management Team formed between 2011-2012
International Scholarship Program implementation started in 2012 
SDPS Constitution revised between 2012-2013

Generous support from the 14th Dalai LamaSince 2011 this project has been officially supported by His Holiness the  14th Dalai Lama and The Dalai Lama Trust. With the school Principal and Secretary, we had the honour to present our project in a private audience to His Holiness at his residence in McLeod Ganj, India. It was a highlight of our lives! Other generous supporters have included Hnuti Brontosaurus (Czech Republic), Himalayan Dialect (France), and Omprakash (USA), and dozens of individual international sponsors.Presentation of the project to His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama in his residence at Mcleod Ganj, India (June 2011). From L-R: Principal Norboo, Secretary Eshey, His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, Kate Kittredge, Martin Knap (June 2011).South entrance to the student hostel (in progress), highlighting traditional Ladakhi design (2012).South entrance to the classroom block (2014).Typical classroom on the ground floor of the new classroom block (2014). What we needThis summer we would like to start construction - foundations only - of the next building!  Once completed the new Computer and Science Laboratory building will accommodate four classrooms - Computers, Biology, Chemistry, Physics.

In 2011, with members of the SDPS Management Team, Kate and Martin spearheaded a collaborative design process through extensive community-based, mixed methods research to learn what the community (students, parents, teachers, management, directors, alumni, community groups, etc.) envisioned for their new school.  From there, intensive designing and planning led to the construction of a prototype building in 2012, followed by the student hostel (2013) and first classroom block (2014).Introducing the new school campus designThe new campus design uses passive solar, rammed earth technologies and follows the requirements of the State Department of Education (Jammu and Kashmir, India). Passive-solar technologies ensure the warming of buildings during the night and their cooling during the day. The campus in progressNew SDPS passive solar, rammed earth campus (phases 1-2).

thousands of others to stand in the same traffic jam for the same traffic
light, to go to a job, that was 'ok-ish', but not truly inspiring, even eating
my lunch in front of my computer. The time came when I ended up having a burnout and
bore-out. My body literally told me to stop and to take a different road in
life. A period of constant fatigue made me aware that something big needed to
happen.<br/></span><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><i><br/>  “You’ll never know the outcome unless you just go out there and just do it”                                                   </i></b><i style=""letter-spacing: 0px; color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; background-color: initial;""><b>~Jonathan Anthony Burkett</b></i><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><br/></span>

<p style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; text-align: left;"">I had no idea how to combine my work as a
psychologist and holistic healer with a supportive lifestyle AND all my
passions: traveling, dancing, writing and creating. I could not even picture
how that would look like.<br/><b style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;""><i><br/>                                                      So I took a </i>break…</b></p>
<p>I went on a world journey on my own and studied with enlightened
masters in Asia, went to silent retreats,
read books and talked with inspiring people.
What initially started as a 6 month break became my new life! </p>
<p>Now, I can truly say that I am living my dream life.
A life in which lifestyle, work, spirituality and sustaining my income are no
longer separated. I travel to places that inspire me, start my day with yoga
and dance and create online courses about subjects that I am super passionate
about. This also makes me very flexible to travel and work according to my own
flow and I reach people all over the world.</p>
<p>The road that lead me there was not always easy.
There were many obstacles on the way and people around me did not always
understand my 'off the beaten track' choices. A chronic disease that I had made it impossible to do anything and my clouded head
made my brain slow down in such a way that even organizing something small was
challenging. So although I could earn money, it was not always working out that
way. Nevertheless, I did not want to limit myself by those factors. </p>
<p>So I had to think very much outside of the box. I
learned strategies about having my business online in a way that would give
income, even when I could not work. And I dived fully into ‘creating the life
that you want’ while connecting with a deeper source. A source that is much
more powerful than you can possibly imagine. While connecting with this
powerful force of creation, things started to flow and to fall into place. Magical
things started to happen in my life and step by step my mission became clear. </p>
<p>Now I am helping others to live the most blissful version
of their life, a life that lights up that inner spark. </p>

their living in a way that is connected to who they <i>really</i> are, the more this will help the world on a global level. And

</div></div>","www.liveyourowndreamlife.com                                   info@liveyourowndreamlife.comDear friend, This campaign is designed to give you the opportunity to enter my very first online programs before they are launched officially, for amazingly low pre-launch prices. The online programs support you to fulfill your deepest desires while going back to your own nature. You will learn to create a life with more purpose and inner spark. Imagine...You wake up in the morning and you feel excited about your life. Your daily activities are inspiring and you feel energized. You enjoy free time with family and friends.The work you do lights up your heart and soul and is connected to who you are. Your activities support your health, well-being and happiness. You have enough time to do what you want to do in your own rhythm and you feel a deep sense of purpose. A weight is lifted from your shoulders because you have more than enough money to spend and you can afford exactly what you need for your deepest fulfillment. The programs will guide you step by step towards the most uplifting version of your life and will help you to get more in touch with your OWN answers about what is right for you and what not, which is eventually the only thing you need.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                              FOR WHO?                If you want to think outside the box
and want to live your life                              in complete freedom, you are in the right place.              Whether you have children, a
steady job and house or are a traveler,           if you want to create more
abundance, happiness and magic in your life,                                                              please read further.....   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Freedom
has always been one of my highest values; freedom to be able to travel the
world, to do the things that I am passionate about and to really make a
difference in the world.Nevertheless, a few years ago, my life did not really support this vision. I
had a regular job as a psychologist, worked in an office from 9 to 17 and had
not much time left in my busy schedule to travel over the world, follow my
other passions and to sustain the healthy and conscious lifestyle that I wanted. 
Every morning I rushed to my work together with
thousands of others to stand in the same traffic jam for the same traffic
light, to go to a job, that was 'ok-ish', but not truly inspiring, even eating
my lunch in front of my computer. The time came when I ended up having a burnout and
bore-out. My body literally told me to stop and to take a different road in
life. A period of constant fatigue made me aware that something big needed to
happen.  “You’ll never know the outcome unless you just go out there and just do it”                                                   ~Jonathan Anthony Burkett






I had no idea how to combine my work as a
psychologist and holistic healer with a supportive lifestyle AND all my
passions: traveling, dancing, writing and creating. I could not even picture
how that would look like.                                                      So I took a break…
I went on a world journey on my own and studied with enlightened
masters in Asia, went to silent retreats,
read books and talked with inspiring people.
What initially started as a 6 month break became my new life! 
Now, I can truly say that I am living my dream life.
A life in which lifestyle, work, spirituality and sustaining my income are no
longer separated. I travel to places that inspire me, start my day with yoga
and dance and create online courses about subjects that I am super passionate
about. This also makes me very flexible to travel and work according to my own
flow and I reach people all over the world.
The road that lead me there was not always easy.
There were many obstacles on the way and people around me did not always
understand my 'off the beaten track' choices. A chronic disease that I had made it impossible to do anything and my clouded head
made my brain slow down in such a way that even organizing something small was
challenging. So although I could earn money, it was not always working out that
way. Nevertheless, I did not want to limit myself by those factors. 
So I had to think very much outside of the box. I
learned strategies about having my business online in a way that would give
income, even when I could not work. And I dived fully into ‘creating the life
that you want’ while connecting with a deeper source. A source that is much
more powerful than you can possibly imagine. While connecting with this
powerful force of creation, things started to flow and to fall into place. Magical
things started to happen in my life and step by step my mission became clear. 
Now I am helping others to live the most blissful version
of their life, a life that lights up that inner spark. 
The more people sustain
their living in a way that is connected to who they really are, the more this will help the world on a global level. And
this is what this crowdfunding campaign is eventually all about. 
                                                  This is an inspiring 'must-see' video.

Currently 100% of our funding is through tuition, however over 70% of our students receive some level of need based tuition reduction in order to participate. About 15% of our students attend Charis programs for free.  The challenge is to build sustainability and stay true to our mission. This is why we need your help. A donation of $25 makes a memorable difference in the life of a child who never knew she could sing, or never had the opportunity to paint a water color picture. $15 buys a student a pair of tap shoes or a dance leotard. $50 would provide an entire costume for a young artist performing in his first musical production.  $100 provides a student with her first guitar. If we can reach our goal of $11,000 we will be ensuring our future and giving a lifetime worth of experiences to students who would otherwise not have the opportunities. <br/></p>We understand that not everyone has the financial means to donate.

About 15% of our students attend Charis programs for free.  The challenge is to build sustainability and stay true to our mission. This is why we need your help. A donation of $25 makes a memorable difference in the life of a child who never knew she could sing, or never had the opportunity to paint a water color picture. $15 buys a student a pair of tap shoes or a dance leotard. $50 would provide an entire costume for a young artist performing in his first musical production.  $100 provides a student with her first guitar. If we can reach our goal of $11,000 we will be ensuring our future and giving a lifetime worth of experiences to students who would otherwise not have the opportunities. We understand that not everyone has the financial means to donate. We ask that you share our needs with your friends, family and co-workers through indiegogo share, and other social media.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

""Toute la terre avait une seule langue et les mêmes mots.""
Genèse 11.1-9






 CHAQUE JOUR, DES CENTAINES DE MILLIERS DE PERSONNES SONT AMENÉES À PARLER UNE LANGUE QUI N'EST PAS LA LEUR ET QU'ILS NE CONNAISSENT PAS FORCÉMENT



DANS L'URGENCE OU POUR LE PLAISIR



Cette incapacité à se comprendre, systématiquement et parfaitement du moins, amoindrit la qualité des échanges, leur durée, le plaisir qu’on a à les avoir.

Pourtant, ils sont nombreux ceux qui parlent plusieurs langues, parfois six ou sept, et pourraient partager leur savoir.

Dans les “pays en développement” ou dans les pays dits “développés”, d’innombrables femmes et hommes ont des capacités de traduction.
POURQUOI NE PAS LES METTRE À PROFIT ?





 AVEC INSTANT PLUS BESOIN DE BAFOUILLER QUELQUES MOTS D'UNE LANGUE ÉTRANGÈRE

Inutile également d’organiser la présence d’un interprète pour faire face à un besoin parfois réduit.



EN UTILISANT UN SMARTPHONE, UNE TABLETTE OU UN ORDINATEUR

Vous pourrez accédez à notre application et trouvez un interprètequelle que soit l’heure, quel que soit le lieu



INSTANT, C'EST LA GARANTIE D'AVOIR UN INTERPRÈTE DISPONIBLE DANS VOTRE POCHE
Accédez instantanément à une communauté mondiale d’interprètes, professionnels et amateurs,
pour faciliter la communication et partager le message que vous voulez réellement transmettre.
Un monde sans barrière linguistique, grâce à vous et aux autres membres de la communauté d’InstanT.




NOUS OFFRONS UNE SOLUTION ADAPATÉE À LA COMPLEXITÉ DE LA LANGUE,EN Y AJOUTANT UNE DIMENSION HUMAINE INDISPENSABLE À LA COMPRÉHENSION










 INSTANT EST UNE START-UP BASÉE ENTRE PARIS ET LYON, ET BIENTÔT DANS LE MONDE ENTIER GRÂCE AUX FUTURS UTILISATEURS
Nous travaillons d’arrache-pied depuis plus d’un an déjà et sommes prêts à sortir la version Android

LE DÉVELOPPEMENT D'UNE VERSION WEB

LA PROMOTION AUPRÈS DES INTERPRÈTES









""Now the whole world had one language and a common speech""
Genesis 11.1-9






 EVERYDAY, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE HAVE TO SPEAK A LANGUAGE THAT IS NOT THEIRS AND THAT THEY DON'T ALWAYS KNOW EXTENSIVELY.



IN AN EMERGENCY OR FOR FUN



This incapacity to understand each other diminishes the quality of exchanges, the understanding, length of conversing, and the pleasure we have while talking.

However, there are a lot of people who speak several languages, sometimes 6 or 7,
and could share their knowledge.

In the “developing” and “developed” countries,
many women and men have competences in translation.
WHY NOT MAKE GOOD USE OF THEIR SKILLS ?





 WITH INSTANT, NO MORE MUMBLING A FEW WORDS IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE.
No need to take an interpreter with you without knowing if you will need him.



USING YOUR SMARTPHONE, TABLET OR COMPUTER
You will access our app and find an interpreter : anytime, anywhere.



 INSTANT IS THE GUARANTEE TO HAVE AN AVAILABLE INTERPRETER IN YOUR POCKET.
Instantly have access to a world-wide community of interpreters, both professional and amateur,
in order to ease your communication and share the message you really want to.
A world without language barriers, thanks to you and to the members of InstanT community



WE OFFER A SOLUTION TO THE COMPLEXITY OF LANGUAGE,ADDING THE NECESSARY HUMAN TOUCH.

<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I'm now 13 years old and I'm booked to go to Space Camp, at the US Space and Rocket </span>Centre, Huntsville, Alabama, for a week's intensive astronaut training in Summer 2015. I couldn't be more excited - it is a lifelong dream for me and a huge stepping stone for my future. #NASA, I hope!<br/></p>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I live and breathe science - at school, at home, everywhere, hopefully </span>inspiring<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> my younger sister and brother and many of my friends to consider STEM careers in the future. I'm an Industrial Cadet with my school and Airbus (planes) in North Wales. I have been a member of the Sea Cadets for nearly four years, learning seamanship and I'll be </span>transferring<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""> this Spring to the Royal Marines Cadets where I'll start military fieldcraft and small arms training.

</div><div> <p><b>Funding Plea:</b></p>
<p>I need help with travelling expenses from my home in North Wales to the United States. The total cost of the trip is expected to be in the region of £4000. I'd like to raise £2000 to soften the financial blow for my mother, Corinne, who is a school science technician and photographer. She is hugely encouraging in helping me work towards an exciting <a href=""http://www.stemnet.org.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">STEM career. She is a STEM ambassador who believes in me totally.</a> </p> <ul> <li>My mother has already paid for my course at the Huntsville, Alabama, Space and Rocket Centre in the United States. Our single-mum family could really use help in raising funds to help pay for flights - I'm too young to travel alone, given the distance and flight changes involved. </li> <li>I have other fundraising ideas to additionally help me to achieve my goal. I'll keep this page updated with those as the campaign progresses.</li> <li>If we don't raise the entire amount, we'll still be extremely grateful for any help towards this epic experience for me.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact Of Your Help</h3> <p>When I make my application to my chosen university in a few years, I'll have to justify why I should gain a place - I reckon that this course, along with other achievements, will help prove my motivation and dedication.</p> <ul> <li>Our future depends on Science and Technology - and needs young, driven people like me!</li> <li>You'd be helping someone who has been enthralled by science and space since about the time she was learning to walk, to make seriously giant steps towards a seriously awesome and inspirational career.</li>
<li>My school has a fabulous and supportive science department - my teachers are helping extensively with fundraising ideas and other support. I know that when I have been on my course and I'm able to show and tell my trip, I'll inspire  current and future pupils.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>What I Can Do In Return</h3> <p> Whilst I'm away, I'll be making a written and photographic diary of my course. I'd be delighted to come along to your company and talk about my experience.

I'm now 13 years old and I'm booked to go to Space Camp, at the US Space and Rocket Centre, Huntsville, Alabama, for a week's intensive astronaut training in Summer 2015. I couldn't be more excited - it is a lifelong dream for me and a huge stepping stone for my future. #NASA, I hope!
I live and breathe science - at school, at home, everywhere, hopefully inspiring my younger sister and brother and many of my friends to consider STEM careers in the future. I'm an Industrial Cadet with my school and Airbus (planes) in North Wales. I have been a member of the Sea Cadets for nearly four years, learning seamanship and I'll be transferring this Spring to the Royal Marines Cadets where I'll start military fieldcraft and small arms training. Have a look on the gallery page (see the menu above). Mum is putting on a series of images, including one of my attempt to fly a plane, aged two....
 Funding Plea:
I need help with travelling expenses from my home in North Wales to the United States. The total cost of the trip is expected to be in the region of £4000. I'd like to raise £2000 to soften the financial blow for my mother, Corinne, who is a school science technician and photographer. She is hugely encouraging in helping me work towards an exciting STEM career. She is a STEM ambassador who believes in me totally.   My mother has already paid for my course at the Huntsville, Alabama, Space and Rocket Centre in the United States. Our single-mum family could really use help in raising funds to help pay for flights - I'm too young to travel alone, given the distance and flight changes involved.  I have other fundraising ideas to additionally help me to achieve my goal. I'll keep this page updated with those as the campaign progresses. If we don't raise the entire amount, we'll still be extremely grateful for any help towards this epic experience for me.    The Impact Of Your Help When I make my application to my chosen university in a few years, I'll have to justify why I should gain a place - I reckon that this course, along with other achievements, will help prove my motivation and dedication.  Our future depends on Science and Technology - and needs young, driven people like me! You'd be helping someone who has been enthralled by science and space since about the time she was learning to walk, to make seriously giant steps towards a seriously awesome and inspirational career.
My school has a fabulous and supportive science department - my teachers are helping extensively with fundraising ideas and other support. I know that when I have been on my course and I'm able to show and tell my trip, I'll inspire  current and future pupils.    What I Can Do In Return  Whilst I'm away, I'll be making a written and photographic diary of my course. I'd be delighted to come along to your company and talk about my experience. For individual contributors, I'll post my images and stories for you to see!   Other Ways You Can Help Please, please, please pass this link on to any people or organisations who could help or who have an interest in helping a young person work towards a STEM career - or let me know about them so I can ask myself!  A note and link on Facebook and other social media. Using the links on these pages helps, too!   Thanks so, so much! Caitlin Fudge",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

</p><p><b>----Englisch Version below----</b></p><p><b>Worum
geht es in diesem Projekt?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>
Es
handelt sich um einen Comic, bei dem Zeichner und Autorin gemeinsam
mit jungen Lesern die Geschichte zweier jüdischer Mädchen in
Deutschland erzählen.

</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Sie
heißen Hanna und Rozsika und waren die Großtanten der Illustratorin
Inbal Leitner und der Berliner jüdischen
Kantorin und Sängerin Avitall Gerstetter. Sie beschreibt das Leben
der beiden, wie es war, bevor es in Auschwitz ein zu frühes Ende
fand. Illustriert wird es von Tobi
Dahmen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Damit
beginnt der Comic und liefert so die Basis, auf der die Geschichte
von Hanna und Rozsika weiter erzählt werden kann. Daran sollen sich
die jungen Leser beteiligen, indem sie sich überlegen, wie das Leben
der beiden hätte aussehen können, wenn sie nicht umgebracht worden
wären. Sie können ihrer Einbildungskraft dabei freien Lauf lassen,
ausmalen und ausspinnen, wie es ihnen in den Sinn kommt, auch
über andere Opfer der Shoah recherchieren und sie in die Geschichte
einbinden. In einem Blog werden ihre Ideen gesammelt und dann bei der
Fortführung des Comics umgesetzt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
So
wird in einem interaktiven künstlerischen Prozess zerstörtes Leben
dem Vergessen entrissen, wieder wachgerufen und fiktiv weitergeführt.
Die Beteiligten schaffen ihm auf diese Weise einen Platz in ihren
Gefühlen und Gedanken. Mit ihrer Fantasie stehen sie auf gegen die
Dumpfheit von Zerstörung und Gewalt und erheben einen Protest des
Lebens gegen den Tod.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1292380/files/20150313090632-Avitall_eng.png?1426262792"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Ziele
und Zielgruppe</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>
Der
Comic soll einen Beitrag zu einer neuen Form der Gedenkkultur
leisten, die junge Menschen einbezieht. Seine Hauptfiguren sind ihnen
durch ihr Alter nah. Deshalb fällt es ihnen leicht, sich in sie
hineinzuversetzen. Und da auch sie noch den Großteil ihres Lebens
vor sich haben und darüber nachdenken, wie es einmal aussehen wird,
können sie sich gut Gedanken über das Leben der Figuren machen.
Durch die Beschäftigung damit bekommen sie ein Gefühl für den
Verlust, der durch den Tod dieser Menschen entstanden ist und werden
sensibilisiert für ähnliche Vorgänge und ein gesellschaftliches
Engagement, das dagegen auftritt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Der
Comic, vor allem die Mitarbeit daran, ist vorrangig für Mädchen und
Jungen ab 12 Jahren gedacht.
Grundlegend richtet er sich aber an alle, die dieses Medium mögen,
auch an jene, die es in der Kinder- und Jugendarbeit einsetzen wollen
wie Lehrer, Erzieher und Sozialarbeiter.</p><p>Der Comic soll weltweit in den Sprachen Deutsch und Englisch erscheinen.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Warum sollte jemand dieses Projekt unterstützen?</b></p>
<p>
</p><p>
Es
ist ein Erinnerungsprojekt
für die Zukunft, denn es vereint
die Nachkommen der Opfer und der Täter in ihrem Bemühen, der
vergangenen Schrecken zu gedenken und sich für eine lebenswerte Welt
einzusetzen. Die Verantwortung dafür tragen wir gemeinsam.</p>
<p>
</p><p><b>Was passiert mit dem Geld bei erfolgreicher Finanzierung?</b></p>

geht es in diesem Projekt?


Es
handelt sich um einen Comic, bei dem Zeichner und Autorin gemeinsam
mit jungen Lesern die Geschichte zweier jüdischer Mädchen in
Deutschland erzählen.




Sie
heißen Hanna und Rozsika und waren die Großtanten der Illustratorin
Inbal Leitner und der Berliner jüdischen
Kantorin und Sängerin Avitall Gerstetter. Sie beschreibt das Leben
der beiden, wie es war, bevor es in Auschwitz ein zu frühes Ende
fand. Illustriert wird es von Tobi
Dahmen.


Damit
beginnt der Comic und liefert so die Basis, auf der die Geschichte
von Hanna und Rozsika weiter erzählt werden kann. Daran sollen sich
die jungen Leser beteiligen, indem sie sich überlegen, wie das Leben
der beiden hätte aussehen können, wenn sie nicht umgebracht worden
wären. Sie können ihrer Einbildungskraft dabei freien Lauf lassen,
ausmalen und ausspinnen, wie es ihnen in den Sinn kommt, auch
über andere Opfer der Shoah recherchieren und sie in die Geschichte
einbinden. In einem Blog werden ihre Ideen gesammelt und dann bei der
Fortführung des Comics umgesetzt.


So
wird in einem interaktiven künstlerischen Prozess zerstörtes Leben
dem Vergessen entrissen, wieder wachgerufen und fiktiv weitergeführt.
Die Beteiligten schaffen ihm auf diese Weise einen Platz in ihren
Gefühlen und Gedanken. Mit ihrer Fantasie stehen sie auf gegen die
Dumpfheit von Zerstörung und Gewalt und erheben einen Protest des
Lebens gegen den Tod.

Ziele
und Zielgruppe


Der
Comic soll einen Beitrag zu einer neuen Form der Gedenkkultur
leisten, die junge Menschen einbezieht. Seine Hauptfiguren sind ihnen
durch ihr Alter nah. Deshalb fällt es ihnen leicht, sich in sie
hineinzuversetzen. Und da auch sie noch den Großteil ihres Lebens
vor sich haben und darüber nachdenken, wie es einmal aussehen wird,
können sie sich gut Gedanken über das Leben der Figuren machen.
Durch die Beschäftigung damit bekommen sie ein Gefühl für den
Verlust, der durch den Tod dieser Menschen entstanden ist und werden
sensibilisiert für ähnliche Vorgänge und ein gesellschaftliches
Engagement, das dagegen auftritt.


Der
Comic, vor allem die Mitarbeit daran, ist vorrangig für Mädchen und
Jungen ab 12 Jahren gedacht.
Grundlegend richtet er sich aber an alle, die dieses Medium mögen,
auch an jene, die es in der Kinder- und Jugendarbeit einsetzen wollen
wie Lehrer, Erzieher und Sozialarbeiter.Der Comic soll weltweit in den Sprachen Deutsch und Englisch erscheinen.

Warum sollte jemand dieses Projekt unterstützen?


Es
ist ein Erinnerungsprojekt
für die Zukunft, denn es vereint
die Nachkommen der Opfer und der Täter in ihrem Bemühen, der
vergangenen Schrecken zu gedenken und sich für eine lebenswerte Welt
einzusetzen. Die Verantwortung dafür tragen wir gemeinsam.

Was passiert mit dem Geld bei erfolgreicher Finanzierung?


Mit
dem Geld soll die Finanzierung ermöglicht werden für:



die Zeichnungen von Tobi Dahmen


das Lektorat der Texte


den Druck des Comics


die Übersetzung des Comics auf Englisch und Hebräisch


Reisekosten

<h3>Hi, my name is Matt Stohrer and I repair saxophones for a living.  And I want to tell you everything I know. <br/><br/>
</h3>
<p>I love the saxophone, and I especially love helping other people have the best saxophone experience they possibly can.  I spend my free time writing articles and making videos to help saxophonists understand their instrument.  Articles such as <a href=""http://www.stohrermusic.com/2011/05/the-unprofitable-valley-or-why-so-much-stuff-is-mediocre/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Unprofitable Valley</a>, <a href=""http://www.stohrermusic.com/2014/01/understanding-key-fitting-hinge-tube-and-post-facing/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Understanding Key Fitting: Hinge Tube and Post Facing</a>, <a href=""http://www.stohrermusic.com/2012/10/conn-transitional-6m-saxophones-the-finer-points/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Conn 6M ""transitional"" Saxophones</a>,  <a href=""http://opensourcesaxophoneproject.com/level-one-tools/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Tool Set For Beginning In Saxophone Repair</a>, and over 40 more.  Videos like the <a href=""http://youtu.be/e5dsY0xzzec"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Quik 'n Easy Leak Detector</a>, <a href=""http://youtu.be/iCe41k1ozbI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Repairman's Overview: C-melody Saxophones</a>, <a href=""http://youtu.be/BwG_LyKUEi0"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Saxophone Repair Topic: Buescher Snap-On Resonators</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCGXY-uLHiM"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">King Super 20 Saxophones</a>, <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDq-zTLh9Ow"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">The Best Saxophone Pads</a>, and over 60 more.   <br/><br/></p>
<p>But all of this is just a start.  <b>I want to go so much farther </b>- to put online an entire library of articles and videos that cover every aspect of saxophone repair, vintage saxophones, buying used saxophones, and even eventually to build a saxophone myself and share everything I learn along the way including tools, measurements, and CAD drawings so that anyone with too much time on their hands could <i>build one themselves.  </i></p>
<p><b>Of course, this information will likely be useful to you individually.  But it also has a chance to really change things on a larger scale.  </b>Because if this information was easily accessible to consumers, the knowledge gap between consumers and those that sell, repair, or manufacture saxophones would shrink.  Consumers would have the ability to make more informed choices, directing the market towards true quality.<b>  </b> Instead of wondering about what you paid for in a repair or neglecting something necessary because you can't understand why it would need done, you'd be able to share a common language with the repairer and make an informed decision that would make both of you happier with the transaction.  Instead of being surprised months after buying a vintage horn finding out that the neck has seen major repairs in the past, you'd know what to look for and how to avoid the pitfalls of buying used, directing your purchase towards trustworthy and accurate listings.   And maybe, just maybe, when buying a new horn one day in the future, instead of choosing between 100 mediocre saxophones that are basically the same except for the color, you might get to choose between many high-quality saxophones that are fundamentally different in design- almost like walking into a music store in 1935. <br/><br/></p>
<p>This is why I have begun to build the<a href=""http://opensourcesaxophoneproject.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""> Open Source Saxophone Project.  </a>Currently in embryonic form, this will be a useful and informative hub of saxophone information, integrating everything I have already done and adding a lot more, making it a bedrock of free in-depth knowledge for anyone to see that is easy to read, understand, and all in one place.  It will be the first and most obvious stop on the internet for anyone wanting to learn about how saxophones work, closing the knowledge gap between those who make or sell them and those who buy them.  This will permanently change the way this industry works by giving the power back to you, the consumer- arming you with the tools and knowledge to make good decisions with regard to your saxophones, whether as a consumer buying a new one or as a professional repairer fixing up an old one.  </p>
<br/>
<p><b>So what's stopping me?  The answer is time.</b>  I get paid for fixing horns, not spreading knowledge, and between my job and my family, my limited spare time means that my articles and videos are slow going, typically with one to two per month being made.  If I could temporarily replace my repair income and focus on writing and making videos for a chunk of time, I could get a dozen done in a week - maybe more.  </p>
<p>So what I'm asking is for you to give me a paid vacation from my regular job so I can work on the Open Source Saxophone Project and turn it into a useful and informative hub of information integrating everything I have already done and adding a lot more, making it the first and most obvious stop on the internet for anyone wanting to learn about how saxophones work, a bedrock of free in-depth knowledge for anyone to see that permanently changes the way this industry works by giving the power back to <i>you</i>, the consumer.  </p>

<h3>So How Much Is Needed?</h3>
<div>Well, I've got it figured that $1500 raised here will fund me fully for a week - including the fees assessed by Paypal and Indiegogo, as well as the cost of materials and supplies and ""perks"" to be given out to those who donate.  So my goal for this campaign is for two weeks: $3000,  though I will take anything I'm given, and work with whatever we can put together.  <b>However if the amount is larger than the goal, I will take off more time and write and do much, much more.</b>  After all, the desired end result of the Open Source Saxophone Project is to host enough content to enable a talented, motivated and persistent individual to build their own saxophone from scratch!  So there is a <i>lot</i> of room to grow, and a lot of time I can fill if given the opportunity.  <br/><br/>
</div>
<div><br/></div>
</div><div><ul></ul></div> <div> <h3>What Can You Expect As A Donor?</h3> <p>However much ""paid time off"" from my regular job of fixing saxophones that I can accrue through this campaign, I will put towards working full-time (probably a little more than full-time) on writing articles and making videos, which will be visible online on YouTube and on the Open Source Saxophone Project.  </p>
<p>Currently, I am able to spend a few hours a month on this stuff.  If the goal of this project was met and I had two weeks off regular work, I could put in about 90 hours; this would fast-forward my content creation by at about a year and bring the Open Source Saxophone Project to a place where at least most of the basics of saxophone repair - like how to overhaul a physically clean saxophone from start to finish including disassembly and cleaning, some dentwork, soldering, pad installation, pad seating, adjustment materials, and mechanical work such as swedging - were fully described and documented on video, so that repairers could have a well-documented point of view to add to their own and so that consumers could have an idea of what they should expect when they spend their money on an overhaul.  </p>
<p>I could also fill a lot of gaps in my Repairman's Overview videos and also get started doing videos/articles examining the basic concepts and definitions of saxophone repair - what does it mean when a horn is repadded?  What does relacquering really do?  How can you tell a relacquer from an original finish instrument?  How do you correctly install a pad?  What is key fitting?  How do you use a leak light correctly?  How should you go about selecting a saxophone to purchase? I could go on and on and on - and with your help, I will.  </p>
<p>This project is based upon something I love: teaching people about the saxophone.  These articles and videos will get done eventually- it is my chosen mission.  You can just help it go a lot faster.  <br/></p>
<p>Because with a better educated consumer, there won't be room to be lazy anymore.</p>

Well, I've got it figured that $1500 raised here will fund me fully for a week - including the fees assessed by Paypal and Indiegogo, as well as the cost of materials and supplies and ""perks"" to be given out to those who donate.  So my goal for this campaign is for two weeks: $3000,  though I will take anything I'm given, and work with whatever we can put together.  However if the amount is larger than the goal, I will take off more time and write and do much, much more.  After all, the desired end result of the Open Source Saxophone Project is to host enough content to enable a talented, motivated and persistent individual to build their own saxophone from scratch!  So there is a lot of room to grow, and a lot of time I can fill if given the opportunity.  


  What Can You Expect As A Donor? However much ""paid time off"" from my regular job of fixing saxophones that I can accrue through this campaign, I will put towards working full-time (probably a little more than full-time) on writing articles and making videos, which will be visible online on YouTube and on the Open Source Saxophone Project.  
Currently, I am able to spend a few hours a month on this stuff.  If the goal of this project was met and I had two weeks off regular work, I could put in about 90 hours; this would fast-forward my content creation by at about a year and bring the Open Source Saxophone Project to a place where at least most of the basics of saxophone repair - like how to overhaul a physically clean saxophone from start to finish including disassembly and cleaning, some dentwork, soldering, pad installation, pad seating, adjustment materials, and mechanical work such as swedging - were fully described and documented on video, so that repairers could have a well-documented point of view to add to their own and so that consumers could have an idea of what they should expect when they spend their money on an overhaul.  
I could also fill a lot of gaps in my Repairman's Overview videos and also get started doing videos/articles examining the basic concepts and definitions of saxophone repair - what does it mean when a horn is repadded?  What does relacquering really do?  How can you tell a relacquer from an original finish instrument?  How do you correctly install a pad?  What is key fitting?  How do you use a leak light correctly?  How should you go about selecting a saxophone to purchase? I could go on and on and on - and with your help, I will.  
This project is based upon something I love: teaching people about the saxophone.  These articles and videos will get done eventually- it is my chosen mission.  You can just help it go a lot faster.  
Because with a better educated consumer, there won't be room to be lazy anymore.",2.0,0,"1 Campaign

During

disabilities, especially those that have autism. </p>

<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The motivation to create the “+me” device begins
with a scenario that happens many times as part of a long, sometimes heart-breaking,
story of children with autism having difficulties to communicate with their
family. The main purposes are to enhance the motivation of the child to
communicate, to improve his/her basic interaction skills with others, and to
extend the child’s ability to communicate and play with others while keeping
engaged in every-day activities. It is an interactive transitional object
directed to enhance social interaction and communication between a child with
autism and an adult. The “+me” device is a soft (100% cotton fabric)
interactive collar pillow that provides visual, auditory, and haptic sensorial
feedback. It has embedded pressure sensors, color changing lights, and small speakers.

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">We NEED YOU! to have the first working prototypes.</span><br/>
</h3> <p></p>
<p></p>
</div>
<p>As a small, nonprofit team, our main goal is to
provide children with autism means to improve their communication skills with
their loved ones. </p>
<p>We are, at the moment, in a very early prototyping
phase and we would like to create several prototypes and test them in order to
guarantee that they work as intended. We would like to test the prototypes with
children as soon as possible in order to improve the product according to their
reactions and feedbacks and also from the parents and therapists. This testing
phase will only occur with the approval and supervision of professionals in the
field. To be able to have useful data we are considering to have 10
prototypes so we can make the first tests in 2 phases: The 1<sup>st</sup>
phase with only 2 children to see the major problems with the device, and then using
the remaining 8 prototypes (already updated at this point) to test with 8 more
children.</p>
<p>Basically, to have the first working prototypes, it is
required to have the textiles, tailoring, electronic bio-sensors and
components, software development to control the prototypes through the tablets
(this part will take time but it will be done by the team members), among
other things. All these couldn't be possible without your helping hand.</p>
<p>We will dedicate a single page in the product's web
page for all the supporters and publish their names there (for those that wish

Me and Valerio met in March 2014
during my visit to their laboratory (LOCEN - Laboratory of Computational Embodied Neuroscience, coordinated by Gianluca Baldassarre) in The Institute of Cognitive Sciences and
Technologies, National Research Council of Italy. Since I'm an interaction
designer and he is a Psychologist and a programmer, we thought that if we worked
together it could be a good idea in terms of developing the concept that I had
been thinking for a long time. We started to create the earlier prototype in
his laboratory where we had access to various equipment and materials.
Beste Ozcan & Valerio Sperati 




Why are we doing this?




During
my PhD I have worked and studied for creating a new design approach (H+) which
augments people’s social interaction considering humanity first. To implement
this approach in real life I have decided to work with children with
disabilities, especially those that have autism. 
I have noticed that there is a
big necessity for interactive wearable products for children with autism which can
help them to have better social and communication skills.                    WHAT IS ""+me""?



The motivation to create the “+me” device begins
with a scenario that happens many times as part of a long, sometimes heart-breaking,
story of children with autism having difficulties to communicate with their
family. The main purposes are to enhance the motivation of the child to
communicate, to improve his/her basic interaction skills with others, and to
extend the child’s ability to communicate and play with others while keeping
engaged in every-day activities. It is an interactive transitional object
directed to enhance social interaction and communication between a child with
autism and an adult. The “+me” device is a soft (100% cotton fabric)
interactive collar pillow that provides visual, auditory, and haptic sensorial
feedback. It has embedded pressure sensors, color changing lights, and small speakers.
The features can be remotely controlled to adjust the type of feedbacks
the pillow returns.
                         We are considering electronic circuits and components in the smallest sizes possible, embedded into the product, making it comfortable to hold and use. The device will communicate through Bluetooth® with a tablet or smartphone for the feedback control. The prototype has been: 

presented in ""Maker Faire, 2014"" ,

presented in ""Web Blog, StartupItalia"",

interviewed by ""Superabile Magazine"",
participated in ""AISC, 2014"",

published in ""Özcan B., Sperati V., Caligiore D., Baldassarre G. Motivating Children with Autism to Communicate and Interact Socially Through the ""+me"" Wearable Device. In: Nea Science - Giornale Italiano di Neuroscienze, Psicologia e Riabilitazione, vol. 5 pp. 59 - 65. Neapolisanit, 2014"". 






We NEED YOU! to have the first working prototypes.
 


As a small, nonprofit team, our main goal is to
provide children with autism means to improve their communication skills with
their loved ones. 
We are, at the moment, in a very early prototyping
phase and we would like to create several prototypes and test them in order to
guarantee that they work as intended. We would like to test the prototypes with
children as soon as possible in order to improve the product according to their
reactions and feedbacks and also from the parents and therapists. This testing
phase will only occur with the approval and supervision of professionals in the
field. To be able to have useful data we are considering to have 10
prototypes so we can make the first tests in 2 phases: The 1st
phase with only 2 children to see the major problems with the device, and then using
the remaining 8 prototypes (already updated at this point) to test with 8 more
children.
Basically, to have the first working prototypes, it is
required to have the textiles, tailoring, electronic bio-sensors and
components, software development to control the prototypes through the tablets
(this part will take time but it will be done by the team members), among
other things. All these couldn't be possible without your helping hand.
We will dedicate a single page in the product's web
page for all the supporters and publish their names there (for those that wish
so).
We want to create 10 prototypes for now and we estimate
that each prototype will cost around €300 with all the expenses included. 
At this moment we cannot give a deadline with results
since it depends on several factors, mainly on the free time of the
professionals and families involved.Other Ways You Can Help

<h3>CHANGING LIVES</h3>
<div>
<p>For 20+ years, Math Corps Detroit has changed lives.  In Philadelphia, our Super Saturday Math
surprises us with dramatic shifts in people.</p>
<p>An “F student” is on the cusp of discovering he is a “B
student.”  A high school tutor discovers his inner self wanting to help others.  A lost <a href=""http://bit.ly/1amdJKI"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank""><i>college girl</i></a> discovers a renewed sense of
optimism.  A<i> <a href=""http://bit.ly/1y7SPu2"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">59 year old</a></i> comes<i> alive</i>.</p>

<p>We are a start-up, a fledgling standing on its feet.  This first year is a critical year.  We had great success with Super Saturday Math.  We
expect greater success with our Summer Math Camp.  <span style=""background-color: initial;"">In 5-7 months, IRS will get through its backlog to approve our tax exempt 501
(c ) 3 status.  Then foundation grants
will sustain us. (Co-founder, <i><a href=""https://www.linkedin.com/pub/david-shen/9/150/234"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">David Shen</a></i>, has won
both a writing award and several foundation grants for another 501 (c) 3
organization).  Funding the Summer Math Camp <i><u><b>today</b></u></i> is crucial for our future success.  Without help from our supporters, the program could be halted.</span></p>

OUR STORY


Math Corps Philadelphia will launch its first Summer Math Camp for Philadelphia middle school and high school students (July 6-30, 2015 at Drexel University).Building upon the success of our winter Super Saturday Math Program, we aim to raise the math achievement (typically from the 40th
percentile to the 80th percentile) of twenty  7th graders.
Approximately 2/3 of your contributions will fund stipends for our 10 high
school tutors and 2 college interns.  The other 1/3
of your contribution will provide lunch and supplies for the summer participants.  Our leaders (co-founders David Shen, Chalon Downs, and Nneka Kirkland) are volunteers for the summer program.  We work as college math and science instructors at Temple University and St. Joseph's University.
A PROVEN MODEL & A SANCTUARY
Math Corps Detroit provides our model
and inspiration. For 20+ years they have brought urban Detroit students from
the 30th percentile to the 90th percentile in math achievement. Adopting this
model 3 years ago, Math Corps Cleveland  students have
gone from the 40th percentile to 80th percentile in math achievement.
Each high school student will tutor and mentor two 7th grade students.  Two college
interns will supervise and mentor the high school tutors.  Strong Big Brother/Big Sister relationships
develop and combine with our core values of compassion, hard work, and high
standards.Urban youth have a rough go of it in Philadelphia.  Gun violence, drugs, low expectations, and underfunded,
impersonal schools take their toll.   Math Corps Philadelphia provides a sanctuary from these.  We learn to care for each other.  As a family, we face challenges and achieve goals
together.RESULTS... MORE THAN MATH
Our Super Saturday Math tutor, Tahmid, says,
""Albert Einstein said,  'A life lived for others is a life worthwhile.’”
7th grader Joshua describes Math Corps Philadelphia in one
word:  HAPPINESS. 
We believe there is a unique greatness in everyone.
We believe the Chinese saying:  “Feed a person a fish, feed them for a
day.  Teach a person to fish, feed them
for a lifetime.”Math Corps Philadelphia is about more than math.

CHANGING LIVES

For 20+ years, Math Corps Detroit has changed lives.  In Philadelphia, our Super Saturday Math
surprises us with dramatic shifts in people.
An “F student” is on the cusp of discovering he is a “B
student.”  A high school tutor discovers his inner self wanting to help others.  A lost college girl discovers a renewed sense of
optimism.  A 59 year old comes alive.







CHALLENGES AND RISKS


We are a start-up, a fledgling standing on its feet.  This first year is a critical year.  We had great success with Super Saturday Math.  We
expect greater success with our Summer Math Camp.  In 5-7 months, IRS will get through its backlog to approve our tax exempt 501
(c ) 3 status.  Then foundation grants
will sustain us. (Co-founder, David Shen, has won
both a writing award and several foundation grants for another 501 (c) 3
organization).  Funding the Summer Math Camp today is crucial for our future success.  Without help from our supporters, the program could be halted.





HOW YOU CAN HELP



DONATE  to our campaign today.  Every dollar counts. (11 donors have  pledged to match the first $1324.)



Not everyone has money
to give. Share our campaign with a friend, co-worker, relative, colleague, or associate. One may become our next big donor.  And  you'll have helped us tremendously.

<p>The Kalamazoo Peace Center is a hub for student and community organizing. </p>
<p>The Kalamazoo Peace Center has an office inside the Wesley Foundation of Kalamazoo. Over the past 30 years we've organized around issues of social, economic, and environmental justice. The Wesley Foundation is moving, and we want to move with them!</p>
<p>Why do we need a Peace Center? There is no 'Peace Studies' on Western's campus. There is no 'Labor Studies' on campus. There is no space for peacemakers to come together to make events, campaigns, or programs happen. The Wesley Foundation allows us to plan events in their space consistently, and gives us flexibility to host progressive, worthwhile events and train leaders in the peace movement.</p>
<p>By contributing to this campaign, you're investing in a physical, public space for students and community members to meet, create, laugh, share, commune, and mobilize around peace and justice issues. This office will be the people's office!</p> </div> <div> <h3><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">What We Need &amp; What You Get</span></h3>
<p>All of the money will be used to pay for the office. After we solidify all funds, we will have a Peace Center office rent-free for the rest of eternity.</p>
<p>Our humble perks are a conglomerate of benefits folks receive by being a part of the Peace Center Collective. Although, if you contribute $1000, as experienced organizers we will mobilize on a peace and justice issue of your choosing.</p>

<p>In the last few years, we have seen the collective grow in active members. We have brought speakers like Andrea Gibson, Boots Riley,  Amy Goodman, Vandana Shiva and The Yes Men. We have brought delegations of students to the School of Americas' Watch, sent groups to protest in Lansing and Washington DC. We have organized anti-racist teach ins and direct action learn shares.  We have vigiled and walked to ground the drones.  We have offered more programming to the public about feminism and LGBTQ topics. We have become a more diverse group. We have connected students to movements for justice in Kalamazoo and beyond.  KPC members have transitioned on to work in Neuroscience, the No More Deaths campaign,  Social Work, Greenpeace, Michigan Coalition Against Tar Sands, and Anti-Racist Organizations such as ERACCE.  We believe for social justice to be realized, students need avenues to practice it.

<h3>Short Summary</h3> <p>Hello! My name is Cassie Racicot and I am a 16 year old girl. I am trying to raise money for a mission trip to rural China where I will be helping teach kids how to speak english and I will get to explore all that China has to offer. The trip is 19 days long (21 with travel) and it is in association with Free The Children's Me to We program. This trip costs $5 400 CAD and I need a $750 deposit by May 31st. I will be going on this trip in Summer 2016 and I'm so excited. Besides this Indiegogo, I am raising money in my school and in my community. I am also working on getting a part time job so I can raise money also.

I am working to raise money so that I can teach Chinese children how to speak english. When people think of China, they think of a populated place that is far more advanced than Canada. People don't see that there is a whole other side to China where people live in complete poverty and don't have access to education. With my help, I will teach these children valuable lessons and a language that they will be able to use to get out of poverty.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> This is a lot of money. I understand how hard it is to donate your money with today's costs and temptations, but please consider donating. This mission trip means so much to me and it is an experience of a lifetime. I really want to help these children and to prove to the world that a teenager CAN make a difference in this world. As many of you know, I have pretty bad asthma and since I'm going to China, I'll have to do lots of walking. I'm working very hard on building my stamina and strengthening my lungs. I WILL get in shape so I can do this mission trip because it means the world to me.</p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you aren't able to donate, you can:</p> <ul> <li>Share this campaign</li> <li>Get your friends and family to contribute</li> </ul> </div> <p>Thank you so much for your support!</p></div>","Amount Notice/Edit

Basically, your money goes towards everything I'll need to get there and what I'll need while I'm there.   The Impact Your money will go to an amazing cause. I am working to raise money so that I can teach Chinese children how to speak english. When people think of China, they think of a populated place that is far more advanced than Canada. People don't see that there is a whole other side to China where people live in complete poverty and don't have access to education. With my help, I will teach these children valuable lessons and a language that they will be able to use to get out of poverty.   Risks & Challenges  This is a lot of money. I understand how hard it is to donate your money with today's costs and temptations, but please consider donating. This mission trip means so much to me and it is an experience of a lifetime. I really want to help these children and to prove to the world that a teenager CAN make a difference in this world. As many of you know, I have pretty bad asthma and since I'm going to China, I'll have to do lots of walking. I'm working very hard on building my stamina and strengthening my lungs. I WILL get in shape so I can do this mission trip because it means the world to me.

I am center manager at a local makerspace here by E4D (http://e4d.io). I take care of the overall growth of all other makers here and help them if they face any technical difficulties. I also build my own projects, mostly in electronics out of locally available waste. Harish, just like me, loves to make cool electronic hardware. He comes from a neighbouring village, travelling approximately 10 kilometres to reach here, after being in college for 10 hours each day. 

Our families are very poor, but thanks to the makerspace, we get all the opportunities to explore and learn. We are trying to establish ourselves as fantastic electronic engineers, even though formal education does not allow us to have that.

</h2>
<p>Over half a million children in the UK arrive at school hungry, according to research published in the Journal of Nutrition. A hungry child cannot concentrate and can be disruptive in class, causing them and their classmates to miss out on valuable teaching time in core morning lessons. One school business manager in Coventry told us recently that many of their pupils were living in extreme poverty. She said children came to school with just one chocolate bar in their lunch box to last them the whole day. Magic Breakfast is passionate about making sure no child starts their school day too hungry to learn. The charity delivers free, nutritious breakfasts to schools in England where over 35% of pupils are eligible for Free School Meals. Schools are then helped to find funds themselves in order that the breakfast provision is sustainable. Magic Breakfast’s goal is for the problem of hunger as a barrier to education to be solved for good by 2020.<br/></p>

Relief - in Gaza with Mohammad Haniya<p></p>
<p>The
ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza has brought forth tremendous compassion
from many foreigners and international peace activists. You may have been touched
by the horrific conditions many Gazans endured during ""Operation
Protective Edge"" in the summer of 2014, and its winter aftermath. </p>
<p>The
1.8 million people of Gaza inhabit a 360 square-kilometer strip of land on the
Mediterranean sea, bordering with Egypt to the south, and sharing a 51
kilometer border with Israeli-controlled territory to the east and north.
That's over 5,000 people per square kilometer! Every life here counts. </p>
<p>These
are real people, many of whom are suffering from terrible injuries, loss of
family members, loss of dwellings and loss of income due to the recent
conflict. Gaza has been hit by a series of brutal wars going back for more than
a decade. Complicating matters is the ongoing Israeli occupation and siege.</p>
<p>The
question remains: how can you as a foreign peace activist help?</p>
<p>First,
we of Gaza Relief believe that the message of need in Gaza has still not been
expressed to the world. For diplomacy's sake, we want an opportunity to explain
our region's situation to the planet. Our main mission is to gather real
stories of suffering, and communicate those to the world beyond Palestine in
the English language. Also, delivery of charity has been inefficient and
chaotic due to many factors, including complex bureaucratic restrictions imposed
by the Israeli government. While the Israeli goal is to prevent resources from
getting to the active resistance, the result has been malnutrition,
hypothermia, and a deepening sense of hopelessness. We believe we are in an
ideal position to overcome both obstacles: we can fully express the need for
outside charity from a truly Gazan perspective, and we can also efficiently
connect sources of charity to where it is needed most.</p>
<p>We
are a new, fully-independent Palestinian group of energetic young adults who
specialize in English communication and multimedia production. We will never
give up because we ourselves are Palestinians: our commitment to Gaza is
strong. All of us live here in Gaza. We work on the ground, right where tragic
stories have gone untold for decades. We are documenting and telling those
stories now. We snap and scan photos, record audio narratives, and capture
high-quality video. We collect these stories to convey the changing conditions
in Gaza month by month in high-quality video productions and online archives
with English and Arabic annotations for historical purposes. We provide a means
for people to express their suffering to the outside world. For many Gazans,
simply having their stories told brings hope. In the aftermath of 2014, the
biggest fear is that their agony will be lost in time. Gaza Relief is also
geared up with social media to interact with you, to help you bring these
images and sounds into focus, and deliver Gazan stories with greater clarity.<br/></p>
<p>Our
work is focused on poor families, children, women, and people with special
needs. As an organization our mission is non-political, secular, and
transparent.</p>

</div></div>","Who we are:

We are the founders of a start-up company called uwannadu (as in “what do YOU WANNA DO with your life?”) and we are helping people find their ideal career... and prepare for it.
When our founder Chris left the Navy, this was a huge struggle for him. Then when his kids faced the same problem, and his kids' friends, and even Chris's own coworkers, he realized this was a broader crisis that needed a solution.
Imagine if every American LOVED their job. We think, if they knew ALL their career options, they could.   How BIG is the problem?

These are scary numbers, but we are determined to fix this. So we built uwannadu.



The way young people like to learn:


Exploration:




Fun quiz quickly matches people to careers


Careers are searchable by title or industry






Discovery:




Multimedia profiles reveal career reality


Videos serve as virtual information interviews





Action:




College profiles highlight education opportunities


Company profiles illuminate corporate culture




Uwannadu’s magic is uniquely presenting rigorous career guidance with real world information. Career choice is personal and we empower people to make better decisions.
Who needs uwannadu? 



This is a big problem. So we built an even bigger solution. Feedback from students, administrators and parents as been overwhelmingly positive.
But now we need your financial support. 


How your money helps:


Your support will allow us to:




We built it, people love it, but the world is more diverse than we could possibly show on our own. We need your support to create video interviews of more careers to help more students. It’s that simple.
Taking someone from interests, to careers, to colleges, to companies, and finally to jobs, is a bold innovation. Your money will help us demonstrate to colleges and companies the wide-ranging benefits of uwannadu.  
Uwannadu is free and desperately needed by millions, but without your support it may not exist.
What do YOU get out of this?


Students you care about living successful lives


Maybe a better career for yourself


Happier friends and colleagues

... and check out the perks


Other ways you can help:





Share, share and share our campaign on social media! 


Email your friends, family and work colleagues with the link to this page!


'LIKE' our Facebook page and our posts about the campaign!


Follow us on Twitter using the hashtag #uwannadu.


Talk to people about it! Word of mouth is the most powerful form of marketing.

<p>A
small, civic-minded, full-service violin shop called Top Notch Violins LLC
is raising money to benefit the children of Shaw Visual and Performing
Arts Elementary School. Currently the school has 140 string instruments in a
state of disrepair, only 60 are in marginally working condition and they need a
little help. 80 instruments are completely out of service, and every year 30+
students who want to learn are turned away from being able to do so, despite
the fact that many may have the talent and dedication to learn and to perform
excellently. With your help we can hit our goal and provide all children of
Shaw VPA Elementary access to strings education.</p>

Notch Violins LLC specializes in sales and service of violins and other bowed
instruments, such as violas, cellos, and double-basses. We serve students,
teachers, symphonic performers, and others in the St. Louis community. Our
employees, including first class luthiers, have garnered a total of 58 years
experience in this industry. We are proud of our impeccable reputation and of
serving some of the finest school districts in the St. Louis region, including
Kirkwood, Webster Groves, Clayton, Lindbergh, Pattonville, Parkway, Alton, and

</p><h1>PhD Project</h1><p>Hi! I am Julie Vanegas, PhD international Student at the Valencia University (UV) in Spain. Four years ago I started my life project: being student of a PhD in chemistry. Working with nanoparticles and nano-science was my dream since I started my studies. Now I am one of the best specialists in this field of knowledge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I decided to get involved in the world of science and chemistry, I always wanted to be the best researcher and to be as the great women in history that had contributed a lot to the human development and progress. I want to obtain an International PhD degree, it will be a great honor and it is one of the goals in my life. To obtain the international degree I have to go to Otawwa, Canada. Maybe you can’t imagine all the important achievements that we can reach with my PhD project. As you know, chemistry contributes a lot to medicine, agriculture, engineering, industry, technology and many other areas of human development.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My project consists in detection of organic and inorganic substances in a specific environment. For example: We can add the ethyl alcohol we drink to the nanoparticles and if it has some kind of adulterant, in this case the methanol (which makes us blind if we drink it), the nanoparticles that I’ve created will detect this specific threat and we can prevent of getting blind. There are a lot of applications of my work and I will be so glad to contribute with all my experience and knowledge also if you are not related to this investigation area. Just ask me for more information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you contribute with my project, you will help also my country Colombia, which is a developing country, also you will help our planet and the humanity with the importance of science and research and you will obtain recognition for being part of the community of people who wants a better world. </p>
<p><b><i>Imagine more benefits! if you contribute with 10€ or more, I will mention you in my final doctoral thesis and you will be remembered by me and by all the readers of my project. Who knows will be the next Nobel Prize? of course my research will have recognition and your name will be there! :)</i></b></p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><h3><i>What we need and what you obtain</i></h3>
<p>
</p><p>I only need to pay the flight tickets and the visa fees, because the other expenses are covered by a scholarship sponsored by my country of birth. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My research is always focused in human progress in many areas such as medicine (detection of chemical structures to find diseases) and you will obtain recognition for being a contributor in this field, also if you aren’t related to chemistry, you can be part of a meaningful project like mine!</p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><h3><i>The impact</i></h3>
<p>
</p><p>I want to go to Canada to keep contributing with scientific research. All my work consists in nanoparticles based platforms for identification of chemical and biological agents, imagine a nano-sensor, which gives substantial benefits to biomedical and environmental science. </p>
<p>
</p><p>My project is valuable because sometimes we don’t know the positive impact of research as a great contribution to the world and humanity. I’m very glad of being part of the people that helps each other, and not only scientists can help, every person can help only if they want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Master in Sustainable Chemistry (obtained in 2012), I’m always looking after our planet’s interests, don’t cause damage and help with the environment. I’m always writing papers related to my investigation and if you want to know more about my work, don’t hesitate to contact me.</p><p><br/></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

I am Julie Vanegas, PhD international Student at the Valencia University (UV) in Spain. Four years ago I started my life project: being student of a PhD in chemistry. Working with nanoparticles and nano-science was my dream since I started my studies. Now I am one of the best specialists in this field of knowledge.

Since I decided to get involved in the world of science and chemistry, I always wanted to be the best researcher and to be as the great women in history that had contributed a lot to the human development and progress. I want to obtain an International PhD degree, it will be a great honor and it is one of the goals in my life. To obtain the international degree I have to go to Otawwa, Canada. Maybe you can’t imagine all the important achievements that we can reach with my PhD project. As you know, chemistry contributes a lot to medicine, agriculture, engineering, industry, technology and many other areas of human development.

My project consists in detection of organic and inorganic substances in a specific environment. For example: We can add the ethyl alcohol we drink to the nanoparticles and if it has some kind of adulterant, in this case the methanol (which makes us blind if we drink it), the nanoparticles that I’ve created will detect this specific threat and we can prevent of getting blind. There are a lot of applications of my work and I will be so glad to contribute with all my experience and knowledge also if you are not related to this investigation area. Just ask me for more information.

If you contribute with my project, you will help also my country Colombia, which is a developing country, also you will help our planet and the humanity with the importance of science and research and you will obtain recognition for being part of the community of people who wants a better world. 
Imagine more benefits! if you contribute with 10€ or more, I will mention you in my final doctoral thesis and you will be remembered by me and by all the readers of my project. Who knows will be the next Nobel Prize? of course my research will have recognition and your name will be there! :)

What we need and what you obtain

I only need to pay the flight tickets and the visa fees, because the other expenses are covered by a scholarship sponsored by my country of birth. 

My research is always focused in human progress in many areas such as medicine (detection of chemical structures to find diseases) and you will obtain recognition for being a contributor in this field, also if you aren’t related to chemistry, you can be part of a meaningful project like mine!


The impact

I want to go to Canada to keep contributing with scientific research. All my work consists in nanoparticles based platforms for identification of chemical and biological agents, imagine a nano-sensor, which gives substantial benefits to biomedical and environmental science. 

My project is valuable because sometimes we don’t know the positive impact of research as a great contribution to the world and humanity. I’m very glad of being part of the people that helps each other, and not only scientists can help, every person can help only if they want.

I have a Master in Sustainable Chemistry (obtained in 2012), I’m always looking after our planet’s interests, don’t cause damage and help with the environment. I’m always writing papers related to my investigation and if you want to know more about my work, don’t hesitate to contact me.



Risks and challenges
One risk will be an unexpected situation, imagine I would have to return to Spain and then go back to Colombia; but don’t think about it, because I know that I will accomplish our project.
As a Colombian woman, I am very perseverant and resilient. I’m always awake, looking for the best opportunities and thinking to contribute (as you) every time I’m able to. In life there will be always obstacles, but I see them as new opportunities to learn and be better each day.
Indiegogo is one of my options, (a friend of mine recommended it to me and now I love it!) but I am also looking for funding in many ways: for example I’ve organized a raffle, I’ve talked to my family and in my free time (because from 8am to 8 pm, I’m always at the laboratory researching) I work giving chemistry particular classes.

Other options to contribute
If you can't contribute economically, you can help me a lot sharing my campaign in all the social networks and also telling to your family, friends or your couple about our project.

The Little Scallywagz shows are big on imagination and are filled with education, musical excitement and laughter, putting smiles on little faces and bringing joy to little hearts.

In 2015 the Little Scallywagz have developed a brand new educational & musical television program 'The Little Scallywagz Playhouse' which will bring the shows characters Luke, Stacy, Alex, Freya and their adorable Little Scallywagz friends Cha-Cha and JJ the lovable life size dolls, into the homes of families and communities throughout.

The Little Scallywagz Playhouse is a happy,
learning environment that is strong on its values of inclusiveness. Children
are encouraged to participate and explore their creativity and express their
own individuality.
      
The Little Scallywagz Playhouse is a visually
stimulating and musically fun environment. It is designed and produced for the
media-literate learner, who enjoys following along and interacting either at
home with the family, school or care group. The target range for this show is
at one to six year olds, however, children and adults of all ages can get a
sense of enjoyment out of the formatting and arrangement of this show. The show
stimulates and invites the viewer to learn, grow and be active through its
exciting music, easy to follow dances and the entertaining individual show
segments.
Up until now we have tried to do it all alone, we
have managed to build our own little filming studio in a garage, created
individual little rooms out of donated items and have had to use a whole lot of
imagination and improvisation. We have relied heavily on the kindness of our
families and people in the media industry that have continued to believe in us.





(Before)

We are humbled and grateful for all their
volunteered time and effort in helping us produce the first 3 episodes so far,
we now have only 12 more to go to complete our first season - just  12  more episodes till we can take it to air
and put smiles on the kiddies faces. We had never thought of doing crowdfunding before as we believed that we were just little fish in a very big pond,
but our supporters have urged us to do this in hope that you will come on this
journey with us and help us grown and come to like and love us as much as they
do.

(After)




So we are kindly asking you all to please help us
complete this first season of the Little Scallywagz Playhouse. Your
contributions no matter how big or small will help us immensely with the
production, promotion and the purchase of professional equipment that we need
to allow us to provide a good quality children's program that the children will
love and enjoy.


      

First and foremost we need you to
believe in us and to know that we will work hard to complete the season with
your help in raising $8,000 to make the Little Scallywagz Playhouse TV series
available to children around the world. Your support will help us finish the episodes
needed to complete the season, buy much needed up-to-date production equipment and
assist in editing and production costs. The purchase of the listed below equipment will be a valuable asset in helping us produce  professional and quality episodes, in a much lesser time then what we are currently able to do.
 New camera lenses 
 Kessler Dolly 
 Boom Mic 
 More Light Boxes  
With any production comes many added costs. The money raised will ensure that production keeps moving forward for the completion of the season.

Mmanze Centre for Rural Development & Training (MACERUDET) is a community-based
Ugandan NGO engaged in empowering self-help projects and sustainable development programs in marginalized rural communities. 


STUDENT HOSTELS & STAFF QUARTERS BUILDING PROJECTWe at MACERUDET are seeking urgent financial contributions to build
a roof for and complete construction of our student hostels and staff quarters
building project by May 21, 2015 (as start of second school term is on May 30, 2015).Current unfinished status of Student Hostels is shown below.Direct
beneficiaries of this project will be the students and teachers at day
and boarding Mmanze
Community Secondary School (MCSS), built by  MACERUDET, who currently endure hazardous overcrowding,
meager accommodation facilities, and consequently lost learning and teaching
opportunities.Old staff quarters is shown below.
Successful project completion as a direct result of your invaluable
funding will provide as far as 500 students and 50 school staff with essential
living and educational conditions that will significantly impact the economic
and social development of the entire community 
(Building
adequate and durable accommodation facilities will also provide after-hours space for
hosting complementary community business services that will in turn enhance
self-funding and profitability opportunities for MACERUDET).
MCSS Students are shown below.



BUDGET
The
budget includes funds for
a solar power system to maximize green energy efficiencies, cost of transporting
building materials to project site, scanners and PCs for office use, and
training for about 100 teachers, parents, students, and community members in
the proper use, maintenance and care of constructed buildings. NB: The Ugandan Shilling (UGX) is the official currency of Uganda.

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION 
This
project will function under MACERUDET’s jurisdiction. A  Joint Coordinating Committee (JCC) will
be established at start of project to oversee its use of funding, other inputs,
and implementation (actual physical progress). The
JCC will remain separate from MACERUDET to ensure strict transparency and authentic
utilization of funds. The JCC will convene as needed to discuss and resolve project management plans,
overall physical progress and any arising issues. JCC
members will be composed of 2 representatives from MCSS teaching body, 3 MACERUDET
officers, 2 representatives from Parents Association, and two student
representatives. 
We will keep all donors up-to-date on project progress and completion via Indiegogo and other relevant media channels. 

STAFF & ORGANIZATIONAL INFORMATIONMACERUDET,
founded in 1987, against a backdrop Ugandan Bush War survivors mobilizing on
a self-help basis to rehabilitate, reconstruct and develop
a devastated nation; has no established paid staff and implements
priority programs and activities utilizing the services of both local and international
volunteers through an integrated holistic development approach with a high
community spirit and a lot of enthusiasm. 
MACERUDET has over two decades of
welfare and self-help project work experience thanks to the contribution of a
small group of professionals located in Masulita, Uganda. 
A considerable part our project and community development work to date has been implemented as a result of community in-kind contributions.

Your entire life is turned upside down.  You're poked and prodded, and everything you do is out of your control.  You long for a return to some sort of normalcy, and cherish even brief moments of distraction and happiness.My program gives pediatric patients that escape.  At each hospital I've visited, I've been invited to come back.  The kids, staff members and parents have raved about the impact I've had.You can help bring some of those wonderful times to children who are fighting the most important battles they will ever face.One very special story about my program was recently featured in a news segment by WNCN in Raleigh, North Carolina.  You can take a look at their report here: http://wncn.com/2015/08/04/nc-teen-seeking-tran...My programs have already reached over 1,000 pediatric patients in hospitals and at camps - bringing fun, laughter and joy to kids who are truly struggling.They get a feeling of true accomplishment and total joy as they create their own cartoon characters, and each child receives a free packet of art supplies so they can continue drawing long after I've gone home.These gift packages contain non-toxic, latex-free pencils, crayons, colored pencils and drawing pads so that they are safe for children with compromised immune systems and allergies they develop due to their treatments.Although I have been freely giving my time to take this wonderful experience to as many children as possible, I cannot do it alone.  The costs of transportation, lodging and gifts can mount up quickly.  And that's where you come in.  Any contribution of any size will not only help me continue to do this, it will also help me transition the program from an individual effort to a non-profit that will bring similar programs to facilities treating these children all over the country.

<p>Following one’s passion can be all at once the most rewarding and the
most frustrating road to travel. This can be especially difficult when one is
told that what makes them come alive is not a “solid” or “marketable” career
path. This pursuit can oftentimes come at the cost of lost friendships,
discouraging words, and slim chances of future hire. However, the world’s
greatest thinkers, creators, and innovators had to break from the pack, and
follow their passions – resulting in products, experiences, and even locales
that we love.</p>
<p>Our passion for many years has been music and we know first hand the
burdens associated with this pursuit. Being a minority can complicate this
situation further. In fact, according to the NEA Office of Research and Analysis,
NORC at the University of Chicago, “Access to arts education for Blacks and
Hispanics is significantly lower than for White peers, and has been steadily
declining for three decades” (Rabkin &amp; Hedberg, 2011).</p>
<p>Knowing this, we intend to do all that we can to encourage these students
that have a gift and a passion for the arts specifically. We seek to ensure
that all students have the opportunity to pursue their dreams and to develop
their skills with intentionality and for professional use. The Flossye J. Bass
Foundation for the Arts will award scholarships to students of color entering a
college, conservatory, or university with the aspirations to major in music and to ultimately pursue a career in
the arts; Music, Theatre, Dance, and Visual Arts.       </p>
<p></p> </div> <div> <h3><br/></h3>
<h3>The Effect</h3> <p></p>
<p>We believe that with the Flossye J. Bass Foundation’s support, students
of color will be able to achieve what they previously thought was unimaginable.
This support will most certainly have enriching effects on the world’s artistic
community, but it will also enhance the lives of those not in the artistic
world. Skills obtained through art education are long lasting and applicable in
many arenas. Studies show that teaching creativity develops critical thinking
skills, engages students, and fosters innovation. </p>

</div></div>","Our Cause 
Following one’s passion can be all at once the most rewarding and the
most frustrating road to travel. This can be especially difficult when one is
told that what makes them come alive is not a “solid” or “marketable” career
path. This pursuit can oftentimes come at the cost of lost friendships,
discouraging words, and slim chances of future hire. However, the world’s
greatest thinkers, creators, and innovators had to break from the pack, and
follow their passions – resulting in products, experiences, and even locales
that we love.
Our passion for many years has been music and we know first hand the
burdens associated with this pursuit. Being a minority can complicate this
situation further. In fact, according to the NEA Office of Research and Analysis,
NORC at the University of Chicago, “Access to arts education for Blacks and
Hispanics is significantly lower than for White peers, and has been steadily
declining for three decades” (Rabkin & Hedberg, 2011).
Knowing this, we intend to do all that we can to encourage these students
that have a gift and a passion for the arts specifically. We seek to ensure
that all students have the opportunity to pursue their dreams and to develop
their skills with intentionality and for professional use. The Flossye J. Bass
Foundation for the Arts will award scholarships to students of color entering a
college, conservatory, or university with the aspirations to major in music and to ultimately pursue a career in
the arts; Music, Theatre, Dance, and Visual Arts.       
   
The Effect 
We believe that with the Flossye J. Bass Foundation’s support, students
of color will be able to achieve what they previously thought was unimaginable.
This support will most certainly have enriching effects on the world’s artistic
community, but it will also enhance the lives of those not in the artistic
world. Skills obtained through art education are long lasting and applicable in
many arenas. Studies show that teaching creativity develops critical thinking
skills, engages students, and fosters innovation. 






The Long-Term Impact

Additionally, according to AmericansForTheArts.org, when supporting the
arts, other long lasting and far-reaching effects include:

Bringing together cultures regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, and age
Improving student academic performance
Strengthening the economy
Supporting tourism and export industries
Bringing about social impact

 

How Your Support will be Utilized

We want to maximize our impact within the musical community, so the vast
majority of your dollars will go directly towards the scholarships and into an
account where the funds will continually grow and be distributed on an annual
basis to scholarship applicants.





The 10% that is not going towards the scholarships will be used for
branding, marketing, development, and production of goods. We will not see or benefit from any of these funds personally.



Our Personal Commitment   
We have
already committed to the mentoring and participating in the growth of students
in the arts within our community. We are also living our lives in such a way
that is a testimony to the fact that making a commitment to one’s artistic
passions is possible. Of the students in which we have had the opportunity to
touch, many of them have decided to pursue careers in the arts or have
aspirations to do so. We want to further our commitment to them and to the arts
in supporting their dreams and aspirations.
We have received non-profit status within
the state of Ohio and will gain federal 501(c)(3) status so that we will be
able to touch as many lives and dreams as possible (your donations are
currently not tax deductible). In this effort, we plan to scale our foundation
and expand into forming a community of mentoring, professional workshops, and
showcases among other programming.
We have also committed to having
regular (non-crowdfunding) fundraisers in the future to further develop and to
raise awareness in our community and beyond. Our first event is planned for December 2015.   


Who Are We?
We are three brothers from Akron, OH who have been afforded amazing
opportunities because of our gift of music. On many occasions we have been
called upon to professionally share our gifts with countless others via
singing, composition, dance, instrumental prowess, and others. Because doors

<blockquote><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><span>“Universal access to primary education is considered as a basic human right by many. Several international declarations have called for increased access to schooling spaces for children, especially those from marginalized communities. Currently, the international establishment of a full course of primary education is also seen as a call for literacy and learning as a basic and universal human right. This changes the focus from simple provision of schooling places to the presumed results of the enterprise: quality learning.""</span></span></blockquote>

<p>So far, we have financed the assembly of a team of local and international teachers, editors, education experts and software specialists. With this capable team we have developed Science content for class 6 and English for classes 3 to 8, and we are ready for more! We have also managed to get a-ACADEMY up and running in more than 200 schools and we know for a fact that more than 10,000 children are already using it successfully. </p>

<h1><span>About Avallain</span></h1>
<p>We are specialised in Education Technology and Digital Publishing and our main goal is to achieve a positive impact on the human development that technology-enhanced education can provide. We create solutions that optimise the use of the Internet as a tool for inclusion rather than an accelerating agent of the digital divide.</p>
<p>With Avallain Africa we have set up a non-profit organisation that can improve the lives of those who need it the most. </p>
<p>From our headquarters in Switzerland we have achieved a local presence in Europe, the USA, Kenya, Australia, Mexico and Brazil and a growing network of integrators for Avallain to offer truly global solutions.</p>
<p>More than 15 million learners in Primary, Secondary, Higher Education, Language Learning, Literacy and Numeracy and Professional Training have learned using our systems on anything from CD-ROMs to Learning Platforms to tablet apps.</p>
<p>From the experience we have gained all over the world, we committed to investing our capacity in knowledge building and transfer in developing countries.</p>

Thanks to your contributions until now, we were able to equip 2 more schools with a-ACADEMY, train their teachers and get quality digital education to over 700 children more.

Genesis Joy School, located in Mathare, Kenya
""The children have developed a positive attitude towards learning!""- Christopher Barassa, Director

a-ACADEMY Unlocks Education For Africa
Our vision is to enable every child in Africa to receive quality education and build a better future for themselves and their communities. In order to address the sad reality that still only 1 out of 3 children receive basic education, we have developed a-ACADEMY, an education platform that uses new technology to successfully share quality education and have a real impact.






   
Our Goals for 2016
With your support we want to complete our set of quality interactive digital education content for all primary school subjects. We want to reach 500,000 children and train 20,000 teachers by supplying schools with a fully equipped a-ACADEMY, especially in slum areas.





How the Money Is Used
Every dollar you donate is going to be directly invested in content production and its large-scale distribution to schools and teacher training. We will cover all administrative costs and we will use all our technological expertise and our experience in publishing to make it happen. Together we can make a difference!
    




    
a-ACADEMY: Specifically Designed to Meet Educational Needs in Africa
a-ACADEMY has been created to work both online and offline so it adapts to the resources of all schools. It can also work on any device available in class, big or small, old or new. With just one device available the children can already have a life-changing learning experience.                                                                               

a-ACADEMY is designed to solve the challenges that both teachers and students face, such as teacher shortage, teacher absenteeism and lack of learning materials. It helps teachers to structure their classes easily following the lesson plan provided. It also enables students to work independently with the extremely user-friendly software that takes them through a unique learning journey.


All the content in a-ACADEMY has been created with the children and their context in mind and is packed with illustrations, videos and audios created locally. The content fulfills the educational needs of the children and creating such tailored content awarded us the endorsement of the Ministry of Education.



    a-ACADEMY Virtual Tour





a-ACADEMY Fills a Crucial Gap
Governments have equipped schools across Africa, including slum schools, with computers and the necessary technology but quality and locally-relevant content is just not available! This is a huge gap that a-ACADEMY can fill. With your donation, we will develop the needed content to provide quality education to every child in Africa.






Successful Pilot, Successful Impact Study
The actual impact our efforts have had so far has been measured scientifically to make sure that the money you donate will have the real proven impact we want in children’s lives. In order to measure this impact a pilot programme was conducted followed by an accurate Randomised Controlled Study. The results show that a-ACADEMY is making a huge difference! Children who use a-ACADEMY on a regular basis have significantly improved their test scores.

The pilot programme showed the following results:


                                                                                                                                         100% of the children like using a-ACADEMY and would like to have all content taught using the platform.
                                                                                                                              98% of the teachers would recommend using a-ACADEMY to their colleagues and other schools.
                                                                                                                        97% of the teachers prefer to use a-ACADEMY over the traditional methods and want to use it on a regular basis.
The results observed during the pilot programme confirmed that we are on the right track and the results of the Randomised Control Trial (RCT) even exceeded our expectations.
The RCT approach was selected as a known methodologically solid practice where subjects are divided into groups receiving the experimental treatment and control groups who don’t. All the students in the study were tested on Science at the same time before and after the experiment.


The RCT impact study showed the following results:

                                                                                                                                             Poor and vulnerable children using a-ACADEMY in underserved schools with poor infrastructure and high teacher turnover scored 14% more than those who do not use a-ACADEMY.
                                                                                                                                      Children using a-ACADEMY performed 23% better than those who did not use a-ACADEMY.





                                                                                                                                     Children using a-ACADEMY scored 25% more than those who did not use a-ACADEMY in challenging and abstract concepts, such as fertilisation in human reproduction, which according to the teachers are difficult to master.



This experiment proves the real impact a-ACADEMY is having and offers a preview of the impact it could have once completed with all the necessary content.


Peer-Reviewed and Approved
The study was managed by Dr. Martina Amoth specialised in education policy, leadership and curriculum development, and carried out in collaboration with Professor Ash Hartwell from the Center for International Education at the University of Massachusetts.

Prof. A. Hartwell has lived and worked in different African countries for 25 years and has a passion for teaching and learning processes. He has worked with prestigious organisations such as USAID, UNICEF, CARE and the WORLD BANK. Like us, he believes in the power of transformation of education in individuals and society and he is currently focused on learning in post-conflict situations, education policy and planning, and alternative forms of education.

“Universal access to primary education is considered as a basic human right by many. Several international declarations have called for increased access to schooling spaces for children, especially those from marginalized communities. Currently, the international establishment of a full course of primary education is also seen as a call for literacy and learning as a basic and universal human right. This changes the focus from simple provision of schooling places to the presumed results of the enterprise: quality learning.""



-Prof. A. Hartwell, Center of International Education,  University of Massachusetts




“Since 2008 I am collaborating with the Avallain founders and our shared concern for the individual learners beyond the science is what keeps us engaged in this challenging field.”




-Prof. John Traxler, Professor of Mobile Learning, University of Wolverhampton



John Traxler is Professor of Mobile Learning - probably the world’s first - and a full UK professor, and Director of the Learning Lab at the University of Wolverhampton. He is a Founding Director of the International Association for Mobile Learning, Associate Editor of the International Journal of Mobile and Blended Learning and of Interactive Learning Environments. He is on the Editorial Board of Research in Learning Technology and IT in International Development, and Executive Committee Member of the USAID mEducation Alliance. He also works with the UNRWA and UNESCO on education strategy publications.


Already Working in More Than 200 Schools Reaching 10,000 Children 
So far, we have financed the assembly of a team of local and international teachers, editors, education experts and software specialists. With this capable team we have developed Science content for class 6 and English for classes 3 to 8, and we are ready for more! We have also managed to get a-ACADEMY up and running in more than 200 schools and we know for a fact that more than 10,000 children are already using it successfully. 





Build a Better Future
With your help we can take this project to another level. Your donation will help us develop content for new subjects and new classes that will make it possible for children to achieve their dreams to become engineers, doctors or nurses. Investing in these children’s future is also an investment in peace everywhere. Through learning and sharing basic human rights we ensure peaceful and prosper relations for everyone.

About Avallain
We are specialised in Education Technology and Digital Publishing and our main goal is to achieve a positive impact on the human development that technology-enhanced education can provide.

From our headquarters in Switzerland we have achieved a local presence in Europe, the USA, Kenya, Australia, Mexico and Brazil and a growing network of integrators for Avallain to offer truly global solutions.

At the program’s inception, it will be similar to

program operating year round. As an afterschool camp, the program will be incentivized
with good performance and behavior in the class room week to week. By
establishing goals and benchmarks for youth to work towards in the class room, the
program will ideally offer participants prizes such as BMX stickers, DVDs, and
T-shirts. Those who are enrolled in the program and do not meet the behavioral

Joby and I am a graduate of Temple University where I majored in Geography and
Urban Studies. I have always been passionate about helping less fortunate
individuals. My studies at Temple were focused on helping to alleviate the
socioeconomic problems urban communities face. I am especially interested in
serving urban youth in at risk communities by providing the responsible role
models, hobbies and guidance they require for healthy development. I work at
One Day at a Time, a nonprofit dedicated to serving low income and homeless individuals
suffering from substance addiction and HIV/AIDS in Philadelphia. Additionally,
ODAAT is working to develop programs for youth to promote antiviolence in the
city’s communities. For the last ten years, I have been riding BMX bikes in my
free time. I have watched BMX open doors for many of my friends, giving them
something to be passionate about and affording them the ability to travel,
learn about new cultures and get away from many of the negative influences they
grew up around.

Philadelphia’s
youth have long been affected by, and subsequently become involved in, the
violence going on in the neighborhoods and communities they live in. Getting

For example, Metro Detroit used the Games to identify many of the places in Detroit that they cherish and love. The goal was to heighten appreciation of their physical environment, their sense of social cohesion, and their experience of safety and peace within their neighborhoods as a regenerative response to racial violence. Mayor Greg Fischer from Louisville organized <a href=""http://www.mygiveaday.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Give-A-Day</a> during the Mayor’s Week of Service where 50,778 meals were packed by volunteers for Kids Against Hunger, 6 abandoned houses were renovated/new homes were built and 12,418 volunteers helped to clean up Louisville. In North Thurston County, Washington State, 50 schools participated by forming a currency, called “Coins of Compassion”, given to anyone who committed an act of kindness, whether that be a student, teacher, or administrator. In a women’s correctional facility in California, over 10,000 acts of kindness were reported and there was an unprecedented 11 days without violence.</p><blockquote>

</div><h4>An Antidote to the ""Hunger Games"" of Our Time</h4>
<p>In 2008, Seattle hosted a five day, free public event called the Seeds of Compassion with His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and many other luminaries. Remarkably, it turned out to be the largest event in the history of Washington State. 2008 is also the year author and religious scholar Karen Armstrong won the TED Prize, of which winners are given one wish to change the world. Karen wished for a ""Charter for Compassion"" for our time, a Charter that would globally ratify the Golden Rule across cultures, religions, and secular traditions. In 2009, the Charter for Compassion was unveiled. In 2010, Seattle became the first city in the world to affirm the Charter for Compassion and embarked upon a ten-year campaign to transform itself into a compassionate city. (To date, over 350 communities around the world have also affirmed the Charter for Compassion.)</p><p>Outside of Seattle, one city and its Mayor were particularly outstanding in taking on this challenge: the city of Louisville, Kentucky and its Mayor, Greg Fischer. The Mayor of Louisville boldly (and playfully) claimed that his city was ""the most compassionate city in the world, and would be so until proven otherwise."" The city of Seattle responded with a resounding ""What?! Game on!"" and the Compassion Games: Survival of the Kindest were born. (Note: Nobody can lose the Compassion Games, and as the more people play, the more people win!)</p><p>In 2012 there were two teams in the Compassion Games, Seattle and Louisville. In 2013, two teams grew to nineteen, and in 2014, there were 159 teams from around the world who participated in the Compassion Games who collectively served over 1 million people with more than 100,000 volunteers.</p><p>We are still calculating the tremendous results from the 2015 Compassion Games, but the early stats are in!</p><p></p><p></p><ul>

</ul><h3>How Can Compassion and Play Change the World?<br/>
</h3><h3>Why Does This All Matter?</h3><p>Compassion is the antidote to the fear, disconnection, and isolation of our time. Scientific research abounds in revealing the intrinsic human necessity for compassion to flourish in our personal, professional, and civic lives. As a profound source of power within each of us, playing with compassion inspires us to connect authentically with one another, rejuvenating our spirits as we <i>actively live into a positive vision of our world, together.</i></p><div style=""text-align: center;"">

</div><p><b>The Charter for Compassion finishes with the following Call-to-Action:</b></p><blockquote>“We urgently need to make compassion a clear, luminous and dynamic force in our polarized world. Rooted in a principled determination to transcend selfishness, compassion can break down political, dogmatic, ideological and religious boundaries. Born of our deep interdependence, compassion is essential to human relationships and to a fulfilled humanity. It is the path to enlightenment, and indispensable to the creation of a just economy and a peaceful global community.”</blockquote><p>Help support the Compassion Games to bring this vision to reality. Game on!</p>

This highly potent antidote is called “compassion,” and it exists within you.""_____________________________________________________________________________What are the Compassion Games: Survival of the Kindest?Compassion Games: Survival of the Kindest offers fun and creative ways to ignite and catalyze compassionate action in communities around the world. The Games amplify what is already working and inspires new ways to care for ourselves, each other, and the Earth. In the Compassion Games, competition becomes coopetition as we challenge one another to strive together to make our planet a kinder, safer, and better place to live!Compassion Games is a non-profit initiative that organizes an annual, international compassion coopetition that brings together players and teams who challenge each other to inspire compassionate action during the 11 Days of Global Unity (9/11 - 9/21). This year’s special focus was to support military families and first responders in partnership with 9/11 Day, Service for Peace, and the Corporation for National Community Service.  9/11 Day is the largest annual day of community service and engagement in the United States. The goal of this partnership is to keep alive the spirit of unity and compassion that arose in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks.The Compassion Games also support coopetitions and acts of compassion that take place throughout the year. The next Compassion Games event will be the annual ""Back to School"" coopetition beginning on December 1st (now known as Giving Tuesday) and ending on December 11th (the day of the last Apollo moon landing). The Games infuse the power of playfulness and compassion with the fun of friendly competition, offering a unique way to address the challenges of our time by actively living into a positive vision of our future!To date, players of the Compassion Games have served over 1 million people in 34 countries by more than 200,000 volunteer players. The Games have been played between cities, businesses, faith and interfaith organizations, schools, and even prisons. Participating teams in the Compassion Games perform acts of kindness and service, reporting on the number of volunteers, hours of service, money raised for local causes, and the number of people served, providing measurable results that can be improved upon, year after year.What We Aim to Do With Your Support!Compassion Games International (CGI) is striving to recruit 10,000 players - known as Agents of Compassion - and over 300 global compassion teams to disseminate the antidote to heal and revitalize our world. Together, we want to ignite a culture of kindness through the power of play and compassionate action.Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to become a Champion of Compassion. By becoming a Champion, you can help attract and support players from around the planet to engage in acts of compassion that will serve millions of people throughout the year by playing the Compassion Games!Play as Well as Donate!
Champions of Compassion are people who accelerate the spread of compassion around the planet. Champions recognize the fundamental importance of compassion - and “Survival of the Kindest” -  in our increasingly globalized communities, and wish to use their personal power to positively influence the development of a more compassionate world!Champions of Compassion Do the Following:

Why Do We Need Funding?For the past 3 years, the Compassion Games has sustained itself on grass-roots ruggedness and small philanthropic donations. From students challenging one another to bring compassion into schools, to people in prisons showing kindness to one another with unprecedented incidences of no violence, the Games have surprised the world at their ability to adapt creatively to any community who wants to embrace and play them.We are positively thrilled with the volume of requests from communities to participate in the Games! With this campaign, we are raising $25,000 to help meet this expanding demand, as well as successfully accomplish the following:The $25,000 raised will help cover the cost of producing, hosting, and promoting new coopetitions during MLK Day, and in December through our ""Back to School"" event. They will go towards improving the player experience overall through an improved website and reporting experience, as well as creating exciting developments like ""Mission Training Modules"" that players can use to train their compassion muscles all year-long. We will build upon this year's efforts to serve military families and first responders, and cover more of the exceptional feats of compassionate actions from players and teams around the world to honor their resilience and dedication.These funds will support this recruitment campaign to enroll 10,000 Agents of Compassion, and providing the technical backbone support to enable thousands of people to sign up and organize teams.Lastly, these funds will help us provide personalized coaching and support for organizers and participating players. They will also help us to ensure that we are providing resources to teams that are in need of financial support. The more funds we raise the more players we can support!How the Compassion Games WorkPlayers can participate in the Compassion Games as an individual by performing acts of kindness, such as visiting someone who is sick, acknowledging the kindness of a stranger, cleaning up litter, or volunteering to support a local cause.Players can also join or organize a Team that may include friends, families, co-workers, classmates, congregants, or our neighbors, and can organize or join service projects to give back to our communities. Service projects can strengthen what is already taking place or lead to new projects, such as distributing clothing to the homeless, planting a community garden (and donating the food!), or helping a neighbor with home repairs.After the acts of compassion and service projects have been completed, teams and individuals report and reflect on their activities and outcomes on a Compassion Report Map to measure impact and inspire others to get involved. Through these Compassion Reports, we are able to measure and benchmark the collective impact that our actions have on our world, allowing us to challenge ourselves to be more compassionate than ever before as we build our capacity to bring compassion to life, year after year!Stories About the Impact of the Compassion GamesThe Compassion Games have inspired innovative and meaningful ways to engage communities. For example, Metro Detroit used the Games to identify many of the places in Detroit that they cherish and love. The goal was to heighten appreciation of their physical environment, their sense of social cohesion, and their experience of safety and peace within their neighborhoods as a regenerative response to racial violence. Mayor Greg Fischer from Louisville organized Give-A-Day during the Mayor’s Week of Service where 50,778 meals were packed by volunteers for Kids Against Hunger, 6 abandoned houses were renovated/new homes were built and 12,418 volunteers helped to clean up Louisville. In North Thurston County, Washington State, 50 schools participated by forming a currency, called “Coins of Compassion”, given to anyone who committed an act of kindness, whether that be a student, teacher, or administrator. In a women’s correctional facility in California, over 10,000 acts of kindness were reported and there was an unprecedented 11 days without violence.

How the Compassion Games Were Born
An Antidote to the ""Hunger Games"" of Our Time
In 2008, Seattle hosted a five day, free public event called the Seeds of Compassion with His Holiness the Dalai Lama, Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and many other luminaries. Remarkably, it turned out to be the largest event in the history of Washington State. 2008 is also the year author and religious scholar Karen Armstrong won the TED Prize, of which winners are given one wish to change the world. Karen wished for a ""Charter for Compassion"" for our time, a Charter that would globally ratify the Golden Rule across cultures, religions, and secular traditions. In 2009, the Charter for Compassion was unveiled. In 2010, Seattle became the first city in the world to affirm the Charter for Compassion and embarked upon a ten-year campaign to transform itself into a compassionate city. (To date, over 350 communities around the world have also affirmed the Charter for Compassion.)Outside of Seattle, one city and its Mayor were particularly outstanding in taking on this challenge: the city of Louisville, Kentucky and its Mayor, Greg Fischer. The Mayor of Louisville boldly (and playfully) claimed that his city was ""the most compassionate city in the world, and would be so until proven otherwise."" The city of Seattle responded with a resounding ""What?! Game on!"" and the Compassion Games: Survival of the Kindest were born. (Note: Nobody can lose the Compassion Games, and as the more people play, the more people win!)In 2012 there were two teams in the Compassion Games, Seattle and Louisville. In 2013, two teams grew to nineteen, and in 2014, there were 159 teams from around the world who participated in the Compassion Games who collectively served over 1 million people with more than 100,000 volunteers.We are still calculating the tremendous results from the 2015 Compassion Games, but the early stats are in!

Over 190 teams played in this year’s 2015 Compassion Games.


Over 1,000 new individuals ""Agents"" signed up to play.


Over 300 events were posted to the calendar that were part of the Games.


Over 4,000 Secret Agents of Compassion received daily missions each morning of the Games.

The Compassion Games’ Facebook page grew from 2,500 Likes to 15,000+!
How Can Compassion and Play Change the World?
Why Does This All Matter?Compassion is the antidote to the fear, disconnection, and isolation of our time. Scientific research abounds in revealing the intrinsic human necessity for compassion to flourish in our personal, professional, and civic lives. As a profound source of power within each of us, playing with compassion inspires us to connect authentically with one another, rejuvenating our spirits as we actively live into a positive vision of our world, together.

The Charter for Compassion finishes with the following Call-to-Action:“We urgently need to make compassion a clear, luminous and dynamic force in our polarized world. Rooted in a principled determination to transcend selfishness, compassion can break down political, dogmatic, ideological and religious boundaries. Born of our deep interdependence, compassion is essential to human relationships and to a fulfilled humanity. It is the path to enlightenment, and indispensable to the creation of a just economy and a peaceful global community.”Help support the Compassion Games to bring this vision to reality. Game on!

</p><p><b>Roots + Wings School of Art and Design</b> is a unique,
locally grown art and design education organization located in Asheville, North
Carolina.  Our mission is to nurture and encourage
the natural creativity within students of all ages through innovative design,
dynamic art education and community collaboration.  We accomplish this through a diverse collection of programs that
serve multiple generations, encouraging and developing
imagination, creativity, innovation, critical thinking and confidence. </p>
<p>Roots + Wings will be opening its new Creative
Campus in Asheville’s Oakley neighborhood this summer. The campus will be
located on a one-acre site at 573 Fairview Road, where we are renovating a
9,000 square foot brick building, adding a new natural playground and new
landscaping to create an urban oasis with outdoor learning opportunities for
all ages. The new facility will allow Roots + Wings to grow and expand –
offering many more programs for ages 3 up through adults – and all on site in
one place. The new facility will also create opportunities for greater community
participation and outreach.  We
believe that working across multiple generations closes impossible gaps.  We have seen life-changing relationships
built through collaboration. 
Therefore we see creativity, and the tools of art and design, as an opportunity
to bring about positive change to our communities and ourselves.</p>
<p>To complete our amazing new facility, our greatest
needs are creating a unique outdoor playground and learning environment, building
design lab classroom furniture (studio tables, stools, reading cubes and more),
and purchasing a new kiln and printmaking press.  We are launching this crowd funding campaign to give our
friends and community (near and far) a chance to participate in our Creative
Campus from the ground up.  Your
donations roll right into our mission of giving back by creating more. As a thank you for your donation, we
have some creative ways we would like to give back.  If financial giving isn’t an option at this time - but you
may have other gifts or ideas to offer to our campaign - please take a look at our <i>wish list</i> (at the end of this text) for other ways you
could help.</p>
<p>What is most important to note is that none of this can
happen without you.  Without our community and our relationships, we would
be nothing.  Thank you for
believing in us and supporting us in all we do.  Every day, we strive to spark the creative spirits within
our students and have had a positive impact on our community.  Then we ask
how can we do more?  Our new
Creative Campus is the answer to that question.</p>
<p><b><span>Why

<p>In many communities and schools, the arts have been
sidelined due to budget cuts or time constraints.  But if it weren’t
for visual art, music or dance and architecture in our lives, many of our views
of the world we live in, and our knowledge of the past and our perceptions of
the future, would be drastically skewed. 
What would life be like without the arts?</p>
<p>You may have heard the acronym STEM being mentioned
as the answer to closing the achievement gaps at schools by integrating more
Science, Technology, Engineering and Math  into school curriculums.  But increasingly, the new acronym is becoming STEAM - the
‘A’ in STEAM standing for the ARTS. 
Finally people are realizing that art, design, music, dance and architecture are not “extras” or “specials.”
Rather, they are essential to fueling innovation and creativity in the STEM
subjects and integral to how we – as humans – experience and learn about the
world around us:</p>

</p><p><b>With so much going on in the world, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed. Earthquakes, tsunamis, famine, wars: the need for urgent help in the world seems endless. It’s difficult to see long-term investments as well, anything other than far away and long term. The fact is that children are born every day, despite everything else going on. They need food, love and education. Not for now, but for their future. This project is about investing in education to empower children in Uganda.

<p>Nelson Mandela once said that “Education is the most powerful weapon we can use to change the world”. Today, however, for far too many children, education is an expensive luxury. In south western Uganda, at the junction of the plain and mountain forests, lies Bwindi Park. It covers 32000ha and is known for its exceptional biodiversity, home to hundreds of species of trees, ferns, birds and butterflies, as well as many endangered species, including the mountain gorilla. The region is rich in natural resources, but many of its residents, including many children, live in poverty with limited access to schools. </p>
<p>Over the years, a primary school has been built and has seen over 2000 students through its doors. However, a lot of the students are not able to continue to secondary school because the distances to the nearest school are too great or because the school is too expensive. Some of these children actually walk the 5 miles to the nearest secondary school but tire quickly because they are hungry. Other orphaned children drop out because there simply is no money for them to continue their education.</p>

<p><b>TITLE OF THE PROJECT</b></p>
<p>Help children in Uganda to complete their schooling.</p>
<p><b>SCOPE OF THE PROJECT</b></p>
<p>Bwindi Impenetrable National Park is surrounded by approximately 10 primary schools. Some of the children that pass primary school join secondary schools that are very far from their homes. They are also expensive. This means that children from low income homes fail to attain secondary education. With a secondary school nearby, most of the children will get a chance of attaining education thereby helping in the transformation of the community.</p>
<p>The school will cater to the area surrounding the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. It will lessen the miles children walk to and from secondary schools and even accommodate children from within and outside the Kanungu district. Children from the war torn region of the Eastern Part of the Democratic Republic of Congo will also be allowed in the school since it will also be nearer to them.</p>
<p><b>AIM</b></p>
<p>The aim of the school is to provide the possibilities of secondary education to children who are poor with the aim of making them self-reliant adults. Subjects like simple agriculture and wildlife conservation are important and will be incorporated into the curriculum as will studies in science and technology.</p><p><b style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">OBJECTIVES</b><br/></p>
<p>• To develop cultural, moral and spiritual values of life.</p>
<p>• To reduce the number of girls and boys dropping out of school.</p>
<p>• To develop students’ imagination, self-reliance and thinking power.</p>
<p>• To equip students with the knowledge of technology that is needed for development.</p>
<p>• To reduce the income gap existing among families and individuals by creating job makers.</p>
<p>• To teach the children sustainable living and increase yield in the farming community.

<p>I will be travelling to Uganda to work with a team
of teachers helping them create sustainable changes thus improving lives of
teachers and students. I have been given a creative yet challenging opportunity
to film 20 British teachers, 200 local teachers and students experience and the
impact that LRTT and Volunteer Uganda has in Bwindi, Uganda. I will be
responsible for filming in schools and teacher training sessions –
conducting interviews with students, teachers and volunteers – exploring and
filming the environment and local community and capturing the action of the
project.</p>
<p>Through filming, LRTT hopes to expand its capacity
in Uganda, Tanzania, Nepal, Cambodia, Guyana and India. Capturing the process
of teachers from the UK and US training teachers that very rarely have
access to continuing professional development enables a clear visual for future
teachers to be recruited as well as an opportunity for the rest of the world to
see the great work LRTT is doing.</p>
<p><b><i>""Film makers are vital to the
success of the LRTT project, which last year directly impacted on the education
of thousands of students."" LRTT.ORG</i></b></p>
<p>Many teachers in such countries are untrained or
have received very little training. Lack of professional development is a
result of young students of these countries receiving very low quality
teaching. This is part of the reason why there are 190 million children who are
in school but still cannot read and write. </p>
<p>To change this LRTT, Limited Resource Teacher
Training, take a team of 20 teachers and 12 filmmakers from the UK every summer
to these countries that spend a month in schools mentoring/coaching local
teachers as well as running workshops for them. They also observe lessons,
trying different strategies on classes to see which work best before training
the teachers to use them. Not only this but LRTT have ongoing online training
for these teachers after the team have gone so that their training is continued
and students have a far better education as a result.</p>

<p><b><i>WHY ME? </i></b></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Having studied and lived in Uganda till the age of 11, I
understand the struggles and pressure the children in this country are faced
with. I moved to Manchester in 2000 and I didn't understand the teaching methods
as interactive teaching was a whole new concept for me. However, I was
encouraged to expand my ideas and think creatively. There was no right and or
wrong answer but through exploration and independent enquiry I was able to get
a good understand of the concept I was learning about rather than just
remembering the method to get the correct answer.</p>
<p>Academically in the UK, they was and is structure to
learning. Teachers ensured that students understood the topic and unit before
moving onto the next so that pressure of memorising questions and answers and
failing wasn't there.</p>
<p>It would be a privilege to see both practical and
academic forms taught and the impact this has on students’ education by going
to Bwindi and filming the LRTT team. For every child the best gift anyone can
give is education and it's the impact that defines them when older.</p>

<p>I would like to thank everyone in advance for the

<p>I will be donating a lot of my own art supplies that I have collected over the years whilst studying art, fashion and graphics design. </p>
<p>However, this is not just a donation, it will be a way for me to interact with the students. The aim is to do a 10 minute tutorial towards the end of the day to stimulate their brains creatively by expressing what they have learned in class through art, whether it's drawing a pictorial spider diagram or making models.</p>
<p>I may not be a qualified teacher and I do not just want to go and help promote the work that LRTT is doing through the medium of film. Their aim is to support and train teachers to think more creatively about their lessons and I have a lot of ideas I would like to share with the team when in Bwindi.</p>

to film 20 British teachers, 200 local teachers and students experience and the
impact that LRTT and Volunteer Uganda has in Bwindi, Uganda. I will be
responsible for filming in schools and teacher training sessions –
conducting interviews with students, teachers and volunteers – exploring and
filming the environment and local community and capturing the action of the
project.
Through filming, LRTT hopes to expand its capacity
in Uganda, Tanzania, Nepal, Cambodia, Guyana and India. Capturing the process
of teachers from the UK and US training teachers that very rarely have
access to continuing professional development enables a clear visual for future
teachers to be recruited as well as an opportunity for the rest of the world to
see the great work LRTT is doing.
""Film makers are vital to the
success of the LRTT project, which last year directly impacted on the education
of thousands of students."" LRTT.ORG
Many teachers in such countries are untrained or
have received very little training. Lack of professional development is a
result of young students of these countries receiving very low quality
teaching. This is part of the reason why there are 190 million children who are
in school but still cannot read and write. 
To change this LRTT, Limited Resource Teacher
Training, take a team of 20 teachers and 12 filmmakers from the UK every summer
to these countries that spend a month in schools mentoring/coaching local
teachers as well as running workshops for them. They also observe lessons,
trying different strategies on classes to see which work best before training
the teachers to use them. Not only this but LRTT have ongoing online training
for these teachers after the team have gone so that their training is continued
and students have a far better education as a result.





WHY ME? 


Having studied and lived in Uganda till the age of 11, I
understand the struggles and pressure the children in this country are faced
with. I moved to Manchester in 2000 and I didn't understand the teaching methods
as interactive teaching was a whole new concept for me. However, I was
encouraged to expand my ideas and think creatively. There was no right and or
wrong answer but through exploration and independent enquiry I was able to get
a good understand of the concept I was learning about rather than just
remembering the method to get the correct answer.
Academically in the UK, they was and is structure to
learning. Teachers ensured that students understood the topic and unit before
moving onto the next so that pressure of memorising questions and answers and
failing wasn't there.
It would be a privilege to see both practical and
academic forms taught and the impact this has on students’ education by going
to Bwindi and filming the LRTT team. For every child the best gift anyone can
give is education and it's the impact that defines them when older.
What Are You Helping Me Raise Money For? 


I would like to thank everyone in advance for the
donations. The aim is to raise £2250 which would cover the cost of accommodation, food
and transport within Uganda whilst I am filming and promoting the wonderful
work LRTT do. With a tight budget of £200, that money will be used to
purchase camera and video equipment.
I
ask that you donate generously as without your support it will be extremely
difficult for me to cover the cost of the trip and equipment.  


Rewards For Every Donation
Received + Incentive:

 




Weekly Blog Post

I will be writing a weekly blog
post incorporating pictures and mini videos of the work that each LRTT member is doing
and the positive impact this is having on students and local teachers — this
will take place between mid-July till end of August 2015.

Thank You Postcard + Fridge Magnet 

I will be sending anyone who donates £10 or more a thank you postcard designed by myself and the children in
Bwindi + a fridge magnet an image from the trip to use to stick your thank you postcard on your fridge. — Estimated Delivery November/December 2015.

Special Thank You Gift + All Above

Incentive – If you donate £100 or
more, you will receive special a thank you
gift; this will be either, a fridge magnet photo book of 24 images of the trip, taken by
myself OR fabric batik painting from
Uganda purchased from Bwindi. You will also receive a fridge magnet and thank you postcard. — Estimated Delivery November/December
2015. 

All Above
Each thank you postcard, fridge magnet, fridge magnet photo book (24 images) and small fabric batik painting will be individual. P&P is included within UK, America + Canada. 
EXTRAS!

 




I will be donating a lot of my own art supplies that I have collected over the years whilst studying art, fashion and graphics design. 
However, this is not just a donation, it will be a way for me to interact with the students. The aim is to do a 10 minute tutorial towards the end of the day to stimulate their brains creatively by expressing what they have learned in class through art, whether it's drawing a pictorial spider diagram or making models.
I may not be a qualified teacher and I do not just want to go and help promote the work that LRTT is doing through the medium of film. Their aim is to support and train teachers to think more creatively about their lessons and I have a lot of ideas I would like to share with the team when in Bwindi.

Please help me raise as much as possible so that I can
support and promote the fantastic work that LRTT fellows do.

<h3>Anatomy, You and Me</h3>
<p>I have the opportunity to dissect human cadavers for 5 days. I'm thrilled and nervous.</p>
<p>In return, I'd love to share with you what I know about anatomy! Particular the anatomy of how our bodies are connected (as opposed to just discrete pieces doing their discrete functions; we don't really work like that, as any 2nd grader will intuit)!</p>
<p>Lots to say on this. Have a look below, and to the perks on the side bar, if you want to know more.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<h3>More About This Project, and Who I Am</h3>
<p>Hi, I'm Liam. I'm kind of an introverted-extrovert, philosopher nerd-jock of sorts. A big part of my life's work right now centers around bodywork, movement and education ... helping people come to more fully know themselves, largely by awakening the body. In my own study, I've learned so much from a huge spectrum of arts, from dance to somatic meditation to yoga to CrossFit to climbing and mountaineering.</p>
<p>What's really important to me in all this ""body"" stuff is our day-to-day human experience, so issues like chronic pain, or depression, or poorly-understood disorders are near and dear to my heart. So is the process of <strong>waking up</strong> to who we really are: less about what divides and more about what connects. (I could go on and on, but I'll leave it there ;)</p>
<p>I feel pretty strongly that learning about our own bodies is such an important, and such an under-taught, skill. I mean, I learned more about my <i>car</i> in high school than I did my own flesh and blood! (Phew ... again, I could wax for awhile, but will keep rolling here.)</p>
<p>And so, this campaign. You can kind of get to know Montana by reading about it, but there's nothing like breathing in the mountain air.</p>
<p>So, too, in understanding the body.</p>
<p>This 5-day dissection lab will be my first time with this kind of direct work with a freshly deceased human body. (I'm very excited, and for sure a little nervous.)</p>
<p>With the emphasis on <i>untreated</i> cadavers, we really get to the heart of what I think is so important, and largely so lacking, in our current view of anatomy: <strong>how our body is so deeply interconnected</strong>. Literally. Physically. Bio-energetically and whatever else.</p>
<p>That's where my heart is at; that's what I think is important to share with my fellow humans as we navigate our lives ... And collectively navigate a huge influx into our culture of chronic pain, psychological and emotional afflictions, and a — whatever side of the fence you're on with this, politically — very unstable and not-great-to-rely-on-for-long-term-heath healthcare system.</p>
<p>Welcome aboard.</p>
<h3>The Breakdown and Finances</h3>
<ul>
<li>$2500 tuition</li>
<li>Estimating $100 a night for an Air BnB or something, plus $300 in travel to get to Tempe, AZ and back Missoula, MT.</li>
<li>[edit: looks like I have a place to stay! Thanks, dear campaign contributors (several of you wrote, actually), so new campaign goal is only $2800. (I can't change the goal up top per Indiegogo's requirements.)</li>
</ul>
<p>And just a note on <i>why</i> I'm asking for contributions in the first place: big picture: I spend a huge amount of my income every year on continuing education. I love it, and it helps me keep growing into being the best practitioner I can be. This year I'm already quite over budget, though this lab is such an immense opportunity, I really want to make it happen. </p>
<p>Here's to forever learning, growing, and sharing what we've learned!</p>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>This is half the fun of a campaign like this, honestly.</p>
<p>I have spent a ton of time, energy and resources into becoming the best teacher I can be. And while it's an ongoing journey for sure, it's something I pride myself on: getting to the heart of the subject at hand, and transmitting that in not only an efficient way, but also a way that feels alive and fresh. (In Zen, they sometimes make the distinction between ""live words"" and ""dead words."" The former you feel in your body when you hear them, and are not just regurgitated information; I appreciate that distinction.)</p>
<p>And so ... most of the perks have to do with how I can share this knowledge of living anatomy, of the interconnected body, with you.</p>
<h3>The class</h3>
<p>Just wanted to spend a few lines here describing the online class.</p>
<p>It will be about an hour long, and will really emphasize the interconnected nature of what's underneath your skin. This as opposed to just talking about what individual muscles pull what bones, and the organs are down there and the gallbladder secretes bile, and here's the name of this and isn't that nice.</p>
<p>That kind of knowledge is, in my opinion, fine to a limited extent, and good to know to pass a test, but isn't even a decent description of the way the body actually works. It can be very mechanical and Cartesian, and that doesn't take us all the way as we are more like ecosystems than cars.</p>
<p>And so ... this class will be on that: how our ecosystems are put together, how they work, and what that means for you as a human being, parent, yogi, dancer, weightlifter ... Whatever applies.</p>
<p>It's a class for beginners, i.e. no prerequisites required.</p>
<p>That said, I think this will be cool for movement, bodywork or health professionals too. <i>How</i> we as professionals educate our patients/clients is so, so huge. And if you've ever been talked <i>at</i> by a healthcare provider, instead of talked <i>to </i>and with, you know what I mean.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help (even if you can't contribute cash)</h3>
<p>Share this campaign via email or messenger, or post on facebook.</p>
<p>Of course, a little note attached about what resonates with you about this — like for me it'd be something like this way of understanding of the body feels so important right now — goes a long way in connecting to your friends' hearts.</p>
<p>There's little share tools above the ""perks"" section that make this easy; please do use them :)</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

So is the process of waking up to who we really are: less about what divides and more about what connects. (I could go on and on, but I'll leave it there ;)
I feel pretty strongly that learning about our own bodies is such an important, and such an under-taught, skill. I mean, I learned more about my car in high school than I did my own flesh and blood! (Phew ... again, I could wax for awhile, but will keep rolling here.)
And so, this campaign. You can kind of get to know Montana by reading about it, but there's nothing like breathing in the mountain air.
So, too, in understanding the body.
This 5-day dissection lab will be my first time with this kind of direct work with a freshly deceased human body. (I'm very excited, and for sure a little nervous.)
With the emphasis on untreated cadavers, we really get to the heart of what I think is so important, and largely so lacking, in our current view of anatomy: how our body is so deeply interconnected. Literally. Physically. Bio-energetically and whatever else.
That's where my heart is at; that's what I think is important to share with my fellow humans as we navigate our lives ... And collectively navigate a huge influx into our culture of chronic pain, psychological and emotional afflictions, and a — whatever side of the fence you're on with this, politically — very unstable and not-great-to-rely-on-for-long-term-heath healthcare system.
Welcome aboard.
The Breakdown and Finances

$2500 tuition
Estimating $100 a night for an Air BnB or something, plus $300 in travel to get to Tempe, AZ and back Missoula, MT.
[edit: looks like I have a place to stay! Thanks, dear campaign contributors (several of you wrote, actually), so new campaign goal is only $2800. (I can't change the goal up top per Indiegogo's requirements.)

And just a note on why I'm asking for contributions in the first place: big picture: I spend a huge amount of my income every year on continuing education. I love it, and it helps me keep growing into being the best practitioner I can be. This year I'm already quite over budget, though this lab is such an immense opportunity, I really want to make it happen. 
Here's to forever learning, growing, and sharing what we've learned!
The Perks
This is half the fun of a campaign like this, honestly.
I have spent a ton of time, energy and resources into becoming the best teacher I can be. And while it's an ongoing journey for sure, it's something I pride myself on: getting to the heart of the subject at hand, and transmitting that in not only an efficient way, but also a way that feels alive and fresh. (In Zen, they sometimes make the distinction between ""live words"" and ""dead words."" The former you feel in your body when you hear them, and are not just regurgitated information; I appreciate that distinction.)
And so ... most of the perks have to do with how I can share this knowledge of living anatomy, of the interconnected body, with you.
The class
Just wanted to spend a few lines here describing the online class.
It will be about an hour long, and will really emphasize the interconnected nature of what's underneath your skin. This as opposed to just talking about what individual muscles pull what bones, and the organs are down there and the gallbladder secretes bile, and here's the name of this and isn't that nice.
That kind of knowledge is, in my opinion, fine to a limited extent, and good to know to pass a test, but isn't even a decent description of the way the body actually works. It can be very mechanical and Cartesian, and that doesn't take us all the way as we are more like ecosystems than cars.
And so ... this class will be on that: how our ecosystems are put together, how they work, and what that means for you as a human being, parent, yogi, dancer, weightlifter ... Whatever applies.
It's a class for beginners, i.e. no prerequisites required.
That said, I think this will be cool for movement, bodywork or health professionals too. How we as professionals educate our patients/clients is so, so huge. And if you've ever been talked at by a healthcare provider, instead of talked to and with, you know what I mean.

Other Ways You Can Help (even if you can't contribute cash)
Share this campaign via email or messenger, or post on facebook.
Of course, a little note attached about what resonates with you about this — like for me it'd be something like this way of understanding of the body feels so important right now — goes a long way in connecting to your friends' hearts.
There's little share tools above the ""perks"" section that make this easy; please do use them :)

<p><strong>Short Summary</strong></p>
<p>My name is Britten Leigh Wolfe. I have always believed that home entertaining should seem effortless and laid back, yet, at the same time should somehow appear elegant and sophisticated.</p>
<p>I have deftly combined these two diverse approaches in creating the tabletop collections being offered by my new company Britten Couture Home, collections that are very much of the moment but also timeless. Now, I hope to expand her line with products that embrace form and function while giving back to the community.</p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>After a year and a half of 2 failed manufacturing attempts overseas, she thought she had hit a major stumbling block. However, over a glass of red wine with her best friend, a innovative idea was born. Britten thought she might hit up a buddy who had a 3D printer to help produce some prototypes, but her friend suggested to check out a company that could manufacture products in all sorts of materials at reasonable cost and in the United States. Eureka!</p>
<p>The 3D printing company has a network of designers that could help transform Britten's 2D sketches into 3D files. After a little research and comparison, she found the perfect designer who understood exactly how to execute Britten's vision.</p>
<p>Britten hopes to raise funds to complete <strong>Phase 1</strong> of her overall goal. While this phase exceeds the asking amount, Britten understands that most of the time potential supporters like to see tangible results at the onset. By contributing herself to the initial costs of this phase, she hopes you will see her commitment to seeing this project all the way through.</p>
<ul>
<li>Phase 1: The costs of labor and production of 3D prototypes($3500)</li>
<li>Phase 2: Mass production ($18000 including shipping and taxes)</li>
<li>Phase 3: Photography for catalogs and printed materials ($5000).</li>
</ul>
<p>Pledging comes with PERKS!!! From our signature napkins to a set of 3D printed napkin rings from this project, and much more!</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>It's quite obvious that creating tablescapes are not curing diseases. However, dining is a key time to share with family and friends. It's the time of day, to put away the cell phones, come together and enjoy eachother's company and conversation.</p>
<p>As I have achieved a comprehensive and successful table linen collection, available at stores such as Barneys New York, Bergdorf Goodman and Gracious Home, I believe through opportunity, I can expand my business and make an impact (however big or small) on the lives of others.</p>
<p>I am so grateful and fortunate to have had plentiful arts education in my formative years. Had I not, I would not be where or who I am today. I started my own business as a single Mom, doing what I love! We all know how important the creative arts are for all aspects of childhood development, but the 1st to get budget cuts in school. That is why I have chosen to fight for children in New York City public schools to have access to arts <i>in </i>school.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Since this is a new venture and a relatively new technology, there is some trial and error. The prototypes may come back with faults, the wrong size or aesthetically need to be adjusted. These will have to be edited and remade, incurring more costs.</p>
<p>To date, 17 items have been converted to 3D and 38 prototypes/samples have been ordered, totaling est. $1900 usd. Hoping they are perfect, but must have budget for error.</p>
<p>The biggest challenge is bulk manufacturing at a cost that will fit into a retail pricepoint that is on par with the entire Britten Couture Home line. This is what a majority of the funding will cover.</p>
<p>Some of the items are too pricey to print in metal, so those items have been prototypes in plastic and ceramic, with hopes to be able to shop around manufactures to produce in metal.</p>
