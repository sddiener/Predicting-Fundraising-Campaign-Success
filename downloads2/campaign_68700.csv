in market and replace morally and technically outdated solutions with new ones.

    Briefly describing my campaign and why it's important to me

Campaign is about starting
     production of heat isolated chambers for water and sewerage, to save
     energy, to be sure that we are not polluting environment with non-tight
     sewerage systems made from concrete or other poor quality materials. Long
     life materials with competitive price. Most important to make safer
     everyday life for people who is caring about sewage and water systems.

    What contributors will help me achieve?
.Creating new product what sets new, better standards in the market. New technologies allow us to create cheaper and better quality materials, so projects will get more affordable and sustainable. No more poor quality high maintenance products. 

What We Need & What You Get
Here in more detail:

Explaining how much funding I need

-  There is need to build one more factory next to existing one and connect
them together as huge one. I have already invested 170 000 Eur to build one factory.- There is need to buy rotational molding machine and
put it in new factory. To produce large dimension components for chambers. This cost around 80 000 Eur,  I
have invested 50 000 Eur in molds for rotational molding, but do not have plant. - There is need for Injection molding machine and put it in new factory as well, to produce small components for chambers, This machine cost arround 85 000 Eur- There is need for 11 more additional steel molds for rotational molding, vacuum forming and injection molding,  each mold cost around 5000 Eur, so there is 55000- At least 10 000 I need to build by my self additional 5 vacuum forming machines.   I have made one by myself.So at least we have all
missing components we can make information campaign to all water works
companies that they can get heat isolated chambers, for water knots or
sewage pressure and gravity system in great long life plastic design and easier to service
this system.
About unique perks.

As I can not produce and send
     to each person huge chamber with pumps inside of it or something like
     that, I can make remembrance - small chamber on just finished vacuum
     forming machine, titled - owner of water tech company.

Where the funds go if I don't reach my entire goal.

All funds goes to realize this
     project anyway, there is lot of points to do, there is possibility to build
     vacuum forming machines and molds, buy roto-molding machine, build one
     more factory and so on, because there is spend already 400000 Eur in last
     5 years. I feel my self investing in better future. 


Explaining more about my campaign and let people know how the
difference their contribution will make:

Firstly we all are drinking
     water, and if there is poor quality chambers, pipes and system at all then
     sewerage is going to environment and make dirty our drinking water. Second
     part is heat insulation for sewerage system, when we release bath, there is
     hundred liters with warm water, and if we get back spend energy to warm it
     up, we use less energy for different processes. Thirdly there is lot of
     people working on pipelines, cleaning sewage systems, survey water
     chambers and their weekday is getting in bad conditions - concrete chambers
     with unstable construction, there is risks to get injury, or get
     infections. This
     is new, environment friendly product which will improve the system how
     clean water is being supplied and sewage taken away. 

   Pointing out my successful, already done things

I have made Heat isolated
     chamber for water meter, so people have this chamber in their garden and
     nobody from waterworks disturb them at home to take meter readings. until now people had
     water meter in house, and waterworks companies may disturb people private
     at their homes. Now it is different. But there is a lot of more
     system components should be improved in nowadays. 

    There is no difficulties.

I can make all these knots and
     chambers produced in factory not on site, so quality is in different
     level. We can save energy, and take it out from warm waste water system.
     We all together can save our environment.


Production is not problem, to
     build machines, design products and get them real is not problem. Problem
     could be construction companies, they always thinking about money and
     where to buy materials - system components cheaper.


Let them get it cheaper but in
     good quality and with features about future.

<p>Sans blague, je ne veux pas devenir immense, au contraire. Si je parviens à me tirer un salaire décent (disons, 147 000$ net par année), je vais être content. Je veux rester petit, garder le contrôle sur tous les aspects du projet. <b>Culture B</b>, c'est:<br/></p>

<h3>Comment je dépenserais votre argent<br/>
</h3>
<p>C'est pas trop compliqué. Je suis cassé et j'ai besoin de changer de char (c'est vrai en plus, poursuivez votre lecture)!</p>
<p>Je démarre une entreprise, alors essentiellement, je dois acheter de l'équipement qui est ma foi, heureusement assez durable. Je «flauberais» donc les fonds à peu près pour ça:</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1455647496/lmbdwqoqzlaizqsxwwpn.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 449.849px; height: 1127px;""/></p>
<p>Selon mes calculs, le montant réel (au pire) frôle les 20 000$. Dans le meilleur des mondes, je pense être en mesure de m'en tirer pour 12 000 à 15 000$.<br/></p>
<p>Si vous me financez à hauteur de 125$, je vais tout le boire en café. Promis.<br/></p>
<p>Si vous me financez à hauteur de 5000$ (mon objectif), je vais boire un ou deux cafés et je vais acheter une bonne partie de l'équipement ci-haut. J'aurai juste à emprunter le reste (ou à obtenir une subvention) et je vais être ben moins stressé. Ne vous gênez pas pour faire exploser l'objectif fixé, je ne suis pas regardant.<br/></p>
<p>Si vous me financez à hauteur de 19 500$, je laisse tout tomber et je pars refaire ma vie au Mexique.</p>
<p>En échange de vos économies, j'offre des contreparties. Au fond, ma campagne de financement reprend un peu le principe de l'<b>agriculture soutenue par la communauté (ASC)</b>; vous payez maintenant et recevez la récolte plus tard. Je décrirais bien les forfaits, mais il y a une section pour ça. Déjà que mon texte est long...<br/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>Trust me, I am [not] an engineer</h3>
<p>Je pense que je suis pas pire avec les plantes. Vous pouvez me faire confiance. En même temps, peut-être qu'on va connaître une catastrophe écologique sans précédent cet été comme l'entrée en éruption du mont Orford. Là, je vous jure d'essayer fort de faire pousser des tomates, mais on va appeler ça un «Act of God».</p>Ça fait donc deux saisons que je fais ça, et je mange encore des tomates de l'année passée. Pas pire hein? J'avais récolté 175 livres de tomates. Beat that yo. J'ai de l'expérience avec pas mal toutes les cultures que je compte faire cette année et ça marche pas mal bien. Je suis autodidacte. Je n'ai aucune formation officielle reconnue pas le Ministère avec un grand M. Mais j'ai lu beaucoup de livres, je me suis occupé d'un jardin pour un café, j'ai fait du bénévolat scout pour des jardins publics. Ça devrait bien aller, je le jure. Le seul hic, c'est que je n'aime pas le fenouil.<br/><br/>
</div><div>
<h3>Risques et défis</h3>
<ul>
<li>Risque 1: faire faillite. Ceci dit, je ne gage pas ma maison. Je pourrais perdre 20 000$. Au pire. Mettons, vous perdez votre investissement, mais vous sentez valorisé d'avoir encouragé un jeune entrepreneur à poursuivre son plus grand rêve [insérer ici les paillettes, les néons, les licornes et plein d'autres choses scintillantes]. Ou encore, vous vous retrouvez désillusionné des campagnes de sociofinancement et on ne se parle plus jamais.<br/>
</li>
<li>Risque 2: il s'avère que je suis complètement nul et que je n'arrive qu'à faire pousser des radis. On se trouvera des bonnes recettes de radis, qu'est-ce que vous vous que je vous dises?</li>
<li>Défi 1: bien prévoir mon calendrier de culture. Ça, pour vrai, c'est pas facile. Mais c'est ben l'fun. Je travaille là-dessus, pas mal tous les jours. Je n'ai pas d'expérience sur cette terre, c'est le plus gros point d'interrogation. Voilà, c'est dit. Je me donne corps et âme pour que ça marche. C'est mon meilleur argument.</li>
<li>Défi 2: gérer mes stocks et écouler [complètement] mes produits. Je compte sur vous pour en acheter (pour vrai). Je veux vendre des abonnements à des paniers de légumes, vendre en vrac sur mon site web et offrir des légumes aux points de chute pour compléter les commandes <i>marché style</i>. Si j'ai des surplus, je vais approcher des restaurants et des cafés pour essayer de faire des «deals» ponctuels. S'il m'en reste, je vais les manger. Si je n'ai plus faim, je vais les donner à des organismes communautaires. S'ils ne les veulent pas, enweye au compost!<br/>
</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>D'autres façons de [me rendre riche] m'aider...</h3>
<p>Vous ne pouvez pas présentement contribuer monétairement à mon ascension vers les paradis fiscaux? Vous pouvez quand même m'aider de différentes manières!<br/></p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Partagez ma campagne!</b> Sur FB, via Indiegogo, sur Instagram, sur Google+, sur Pinterest, sur MySpace, sur SkyRock, par la poste, whatever. Je voudrais que ça devienne viral. J'espère au moins égaler la popularité du Gangnam Style!</li>
<li>Partagez l'adresse de mon site web et suivez le compte de <b>Culture B</b> sur FB et les autres médias sociaux. Si vous ne le faites pas, je vais acheter de la pub FB et vous y serez confronté anyway.</li>
<li>
<b>Inscrivez-vous à un abonnement aux paniers de légumes</b>, <b>ACHETEZ-MOI DES LÉGUMES dans ma boutique en ligne</b> ou transférez-moi une partie de vos REER. Blague à part, faites un petit geste feel-good en achetant quelques légumes biologiques locaux. Y'a juste des avantages: réduction des GES, croissance de l'économie locale, réduction des pesticides et composés chimiques quelconques, des saveurs rehaussées dans votre lunch du mardi midi, investissement dans votre santé et désengorgement à long terme des hôpitaux, etc.</li>
<li>Proposez votre aide bénévole. Je ne dirai pas non à deux trois amiEs pour venir m'aider à semer, désherber, récolter, laver les légumes, coller des timbres sur des enveloppes.<br/>
</li>
<li>Envoyez-moi une lettre d'encouragements. Mettons: «Go P-A, faut que tu keep le focus su'a puck pendant 70 minutes! Donne ton 110% pis envoie un vœu à l'univers!» Je vais vous trouver ben fins.</li>

<h3>«Décharge de responsabilité à des fins légales, veuillez signer dans la case ci-bas, à côté du X»<br/>
</h3>1. En contribuant à ma campagne, vous faites acte de foi; afin que tout soit clair, vous reconnaissez être conscient des risques inhérents à l'agriculture et vous me faites confiance quant au contenu des paniers. C'est moi qui va le déterminer. Je ne me m'avance pas sur les dates de livraison ni sur la quantité de la récolte. La météo et les mille et un autres facteurs hors de mon contrôle pourraient augmenter ou diminuer ma récolte et donc vos contreparties. Je n'y peux rien. Cependant, si la récolte est bonne, je vais tout faire pour que vous soyez plus que satisfaits de vos contreparties.<br/><br/>2. Par ailleurs, il y a des limites aux endroits où je vais aller livrer mes légumes. J'ai des intérêts à Saint-Basile-le-Grand, Montréal et Sherbrooke, pour des raisons écologiques et financières, on s'entend que je vais pas mal m'en tenir à ça et n'irai pas virer à Québec ou Chibougamau (non, je n'irai pas à Chibougamau) pour 25$ de légumes. «Loin des yeux, loin des légumes» comme on dit... mais je vais être très reconnaissant.

Là, je vous jure d'essayer fort de faire pousser des tomates, mais on va appeler ça un «Act of God».Ça fait donc deux saisons que je fais ça, et je mange encore des tomates de l'année passée. Pas pire hein? J'avais récolté 175 livres de tomates. Beat that yo. J'ai de l'expérience avec pas mal toutes les cultures que je compte faire cette année et ça marche pas mal bien. Je suis autodidacte. Je n'ai aucune formation officielle reconnue pas le Ministère avec un grand M. Mais j'ai lu beaucoup de livres, je me suis occupé d'un jardin pour un café, j'ai fait du bénévolat scout pour des jardins publics. Ça devrait bien aller, je le jure. Le seul hic, c'est que je n'aime pas le fenouil.

Risques et défis

Risque 1: faire faillite. Ceci dit, je ne gage pas ma maison. Je pourrais perdre 20 000$. Au pire. Mettons, vous perdez votre investissement, mais vous sentez valorisé d'avoir encouragé un jeune entrepreneur à poursuivre son plus grand rêve [insérer ici les paillettes, les néons, les licornes et plein d'autres choses scintillantes]. Ou encore, vous vous retrouvez désillusionné des campagnes de sociofinancement et on ne se parle plus jamais.

Risque 2: il s'avère que je suis complètement nul et que je n'arrive qu'à faire pousser des radis. On se trouvera des bonnes recettes de radis, qu'est-ce que vous vous que je vous dises?
Défi 1: bien prévoir mon calendrier de culture. Ça, pour vrai, c'est pas facile. Mais c'est ben l'fun. Je travaille là-dessus, pas mal tous les jours. Je n'ai pas d'expérience sur cette terre, c'est le plus gros point d'interrogation. Voilà, c'est dit. Je me donne corps et âme pour que ça marche. C'est mon meilleur argument.
Défi 2: gérer mes stocks et écouler [complètement] mes produits. Je compte sur vous pour en acheter (pour vrai). Je veux vendre des abonnements à des paniers de légumes, vendre en vrac sur mon site web et offrir des légumes aux points de chute pour compléter les commandes marché style. Si j'ai des surplus, je vais approcher des restaurants et des cafés pour essayer de faire des «deals» ponctuels. S'il m'en reste, je vais les manger. Si je n'ai plus faim, je vais les donner à des organismes communautaires. S'ils ne les veulent pas, enweye au compost!



D'autres façons de [me rendre riche] m'aider...

Inscrivez-vous à un abonnement aux paniers de légumes, ACHETEZ-MOI DES LÉGUMES dans ma boutique en ligne ou transférez-moi une partie de vos REER. Blague à part, faites un petit geste feel-good en achetant quelques légumes biologiques locaux. Y'a juste des avantages: réduction des GES, croissance de l'économie locale, réduction des pesticides et composés chimiques quelconques, des saveurs rehaussées dans votre lunch du mardi midi, investissement dans votre santé et désengorgement à long terme des hôpitaux, etc.
Proposez votre aide bénévole. Je ne dirai pas non à deux trois amiEs pour venir m'aider à semer, désherber, récolter, laver les légumes, coller des timbres sur des enveloppes.

Envoyez-moi une lettre d'encouragements. Mettons: «Go P-A, faut que tu keep le focus su'a puck pendant 70 minutes! Donne ton 110% pis envoie un vœu à l'univers!» Je vais vous trouver ben fins.

1. En contribuant à ma campagne, vous faites acte de foi; afin que tout soit clair, vous reconnaissez être conscient des risques inhérents à l'agriculture et vous me faites confiance quant au contenu des paniers. C'est moi qui va le déterminer. Je ne me m'avance pas sur les dates de livraison ni sur la quantité de la récolte. La météo et les mille et un autres facteurs hors de mon contrôle pourraient augmenter ou diminuer ma récolte et donc vos contreparties. Je n'y peux rien. Cependant, si la récolte est bonne, je vais tout faire pour que vous soyez plus que satisfaits de vos contreparties.2. Par ailleurs, il y a des limites aux endroits où je vais aller livrer mes légumes. J'ai des intérêts à Saint-Basile-le-Grand, Montréal et Sherbrooke, pour des raisons écologiques et financières, on s'entend que je vais pas mal m'en tenir à ça et n'irai pas virer à Québec ou Chibougamau (non, je n'irai pas à Chibougamau) pour 25$ de légumes. «Loin des yeux, loin des légumes» comme on dit... mais je vais être très reconnaissant.

While each country’s dishes are distinct, there are many commonalities between them, and their similar climates have inspired a variety of foods and flavors that are at once familiar and exotic. Essie Spice and the Essential Sauce Collection were born out of many years of experimenting with traditional West African cooking techniques and spices, and the blending of these techniques with popular flavors from around the world. Born and raised in Ghana, Essie Bartels’ mission was to create sauces and other foods that would demonstrate the vibrant tastes and traditions of her heritage and transport these flavors directly to the American dinner table.  </p><p><b>Are You Familiar with West African Cuisine?</b></p><p>How many African restaurants do you know of? Now count how many of them are West African? Or West African inspired? West African fusion? How many of these restaurants, if you could think of any, would you comfortably host a party or event at, invite friends etc? </p><p>Even in New York City, where nearly all cultures and cuisines are represented, there are very few West African food establishments, brands or eateries where people can enjoy food or purchase products that highlight West African cuisine. Very few restaurants or food brands represent our culture and our food in the United States. Everyone is familiar with Italian, French &amp; even Moroccan cuisine, but so little is known about the foods, techniques, spices, and cooking traditions of Ghana, Senegal or Benin.</p><b><br/></b><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471553091/Ghana-flag_p9wuar.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><b>Our Story </b></p><p>Essie Bartels was born and raised in Ghana, and began cooking with the traditional spices of the region at the age of eight in her mother’s kitchen. Some of Essie’s earliest memories involved regularly watching the history, travel, and cooking channels with her father. Every Sunday after church her family would go out to lunch, and each week they would sample a different cuisine, from Chinese to French and everything in between.</p><p>When Essie turned 18, she moved to the United States to attend college. She carried on her cooking traditions from home during college and all throughout her 9 years in corporate America. Encouraged by friends in the U.S. who enjoyed her cooking, and inspired by her own desire to showcase her heritage and demonstrate the appeal of West African flavors and cuisine, she began conducting extensive research on native foods and spices. During this time she also traveled to 24 countries, and each time she immersed herself in the region’s cuisine by taking classes and learning various traditions. She studied and became familiar with the foods, flavors, and cooking techniques of Mexico, France, South Africa and Costa Rica. These experiences helped Essie to identify the commonalities with food from each region, as well as what makes each country’s cuisine unique. Essie’s first sauce was born after returning from a trip to Mexico with a bag of Mexican tamarind candies. Reminded of the tamarind fruit that was so prevalent during her childhood in Ghana, Essie melted down the candies to form a glaze and soon her Tamarind OH! marinade was born. </p><p>Today, Essie has been called a “spice mixologist” and a “culinary ‘ambassador’ for West Africa.” Each sauce that followed Tamarind OH! was the result of similar experimentation and the fusion of West African flavors with global cooking traditions. These are concoctions and combinations that come naturally to Essie in her kitchen, and that you can now experiment with in your own home through Essie Spice’s Essential Sauce Collection. </p><p></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471554122/FullSizeRender_12_awhx6n.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 620px;height: 724px;""/></p><div><br/></div><div><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1474231760/EssieAmericanVoices_jpg_uhpvat.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p></div><br/><p><b>How Do We Make Our Sauces?</b></p><p>Essie Spice features the finest of ingredients sourced directly from small businesses and producers, and our sourcing begins in Northern Ghana, in partnership with a local businesswoman named Hajia Limata. The dry spices at the heart of all Essie Spice sauces are sourced from Hajia, who has been working with herbs and spices since she was a little girl. As an adult she began selling them at the Makola Market, the biggest open-air market in Accra, the capital of Ghana. The Makola Market is where Hajia met and began supplying Essie’s mother with spices for export to the United States. Essie was able to experiment with Hajia’s spices in the U.S., and her partnership with Hajia was born. Our dried ginger, our grains of selim, alligator pepper &amp; our West African nutmeg are all sourced directly from her kitchen. The impact of Essie Spice on Hajia’s business in Ghana has been tremendous, enabling her to support &amp; educate both her daughter and her granddaughter. </p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471555237/FullSizeRender_13_ssujed.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p><br/></p><p>The fresh ingredients in Essie Spice are sourced from produce distributors in the tri-state area that specialize in exotic ingredients, keeping the business local and the supply-chain short.

It adds a unique intense flavor with subtle hints of Selim pepper.</p><p>If you are a heat lover (like me!), the <b>Mango Medley</b> is just for you. It‘s the sauce you can carry along when you travel and want to bring that African kick to your food anywhere anytime. There is nothing like hot pepper to open up one’s palate to flavors. Here, the heat from the habanero is balanced with the sweetness of the mango, which also reminds me of those childhood days in Dakar, when, during the rainy season, we couldn’t wait for the mangoes to ripen.

<p><b>What Have We
Accomplished So Far?</b></p>
<p>From year 1 (in 2013) to year 2, Essie Spice doubled the sales
of our Essential Sauce Collection. During this time we also expanded our sales platform
beyond online orders to include six brick-and-mortar stores, farmers’ markets,
in-store demos and pop-up shops. Every Essie Spice in-store demo has resulted
in completely selling out of our on-site inventory.</p><p><span>Increased media attention around <a href=""http://www.northjersey.com/food-and-dining-news/englewood-s-spice-mixologist-is-a-culinary-ambassador-for-africa-1.1619334"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">our popular sauces</a>, a growing social media
following (on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter), and exposure from attendance at
food events around the tri-state (NY, NJ, CT) area has translated to a
consistent growth in demand for Essie Spice sauces and spice blends. We have recently
received inquiries and finally landed shelf space from National Retailers Wholefoods Market and ShopRite Supermarkets. We are currently available for sale in the Brooklyn Wholefoods and the Englewood, NJ ShopRite Store. Wholefoods has over 430 stores and ShopRite has over 250 stores. We need to be able to raise the funds to ramp up production to meet demand. With your support we can grow our business to match this demand and begin
distributing our sauces to even wider audiences on a regional and national
scale.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471553904/IMG_1679_o6xsta.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/><p></p><p><span>Since our first year in business, we have donated 10% of the proceeds from our anniversary sale to nonprofit charities that are doing important work in communities around the world. Charities we have supported thus far include Medecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders, The Abide Family (Uganda), Tatas And Friends (Ghana), The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society, and the Kili Summit for Clean Water under the African Development Initiative. As Essie Spice continues to grow our intention is to continue and to expand this important tradition of giving back to our communities.   </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471553781/FullSizeRender_10_oydlxe.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p></p><p><br/></p>

will represent the four corners of Africa; East, West, South and North. Essie
is also developing signature Essie Spice Milks, Nuts, Butters and Oils, that
currently cannot be found anywhere but the African continent. Essie is also currently in talks with farmers in the Northern Regions of Ghana to introduce ancient grains like Millet, Sorghum and Fonio which have high nutritional value but are unavailable on the market.</p><p> And she has also
begun working with artisans and producers in Kumasi, Ghana to develop the Essie
Spice Aprons and Pottery collection. Investing in and partnering with these
artisans, who will receive all revenue directly, will impact their livelihoods
and the livelihoods of entire communities in Kumasi.</p>
<p>For one little girl, the journey started in her mother's tiny
kitchen in Ghana where her love affair with spice was ignited. Her
flavorful journey continued all over the globe, spurred by her insatiable
appetite for travel. She played with exotic palates; she tested cuisines,
she concocted condiments. As her experiments with spices grew, so did the
demand for her homemade sauces which all boiled down to what you now find in
this jar: bottled up joy handed down through three generations to spice up your
life. That little girl was Essie, and this is Essie Spice.</p>

<br/><p></p></div>","Bring the flavors and spice blends of West Africa, with influences from cuisines around the globe, to your own dinner table – one sauce at a time.The countries of West Africa have rich cultures and traditions, and each boasts a particularly defined food culture. While each country’s dishes are distinct, there are many commonalities between them, and their similar climates have inspired a variety of foods and flavors that are at once familiar and exotic. Essie Spice and the Essential Sauce Collection were born out of many years of experimenting with traditional West African cooking techniques and spices, and the blending of these techniques with popular flavors from around the world. Born and raised in Ghana, Essie Bartels’ mission was to create sauces and other foods that would demonstrate the vibrant tastes and traditions of her heritage and transport these flavors directly to the American dinner table.  Are You Familiar with West African Cuisine?How many African restaurants do you know of? Now count how many of them are West African? Or West African inspired? West African fusion? How many of these restaurants, if you could think of any, would you comfortably host a party or event at, invite friends etc? Even in New York City, where nearly all cultures and cuisines are represented, there are very few West African food establishments, brands or eateries where people can enjoy food or purchase products that highlight West African cuisine. Very few restaurants or food brands represent our culture and our food in the United States. Everyone is familiar with Italian, French & even Moroccan cuisine, but so little is known about the foods, techniques, spices, and cooking traditions of Ghana, Senegal or Benin.Our Story Essie Bartels was born and raised in Ghana, and began cooking with the traditional spices of the region at the age of eight in her mother’s kitchen. Some of Essie’s earliest memories involved regularly watching the history, travel, and cooking channels with her father. Every Sunday after church her family would go out to lunch, and each week they would sample a different cuisine, from Chinese to French and everything in between.When Essie turned 18, she moved to the United States to attend college. She carried on her cooking traditions from home during college and all throughout her 9 years in corporate America. Encouraged by friends in the U.S. who enjoyed her cooking, and inspired by her own desire to showcase her heritage and demonstrate the appeal of West African flavors and cuisine, she began conducting extensive research on native foods and spices. During this time she also traveled to 24 countries, and each time she immersed herself in the region’s cuisine by taking classes and learning various traditions. She studied and became familiar with the foods, flavors, and cooking techniques of Mexico, France, South Africa and Costa Rica. These experiences helped Essie to identify the commonalities with food from each region, as well as what makes each country’s cuisine unique. Essie’s first sauce was born after returning from a trip to Mexico with a bag of Mexican tamarind candies. Reminded of the tamarind fruit that was so prevalent during her childhood in Ghana, Essie melted down the candies to form a glaze and soon her Tamarind OH! marinade was born. Today, Essie has been called a “spice mixologist” and a “culinary ‘ambassador’ for West Africa.” Each sauce that followed Tamarind OH! was the result of similar experimentation and the fusion of West African flavors with global cooking traditions. These are concoctions and combinations that come naturally to Essie in her kitchen, and that you can now experiment with in your own home through Essie Spice’s Essential Sauce Collection. How Do We Make Our Sauces?Essie Spice features the finest of ingredients sourced directly from small businesses and producers, and our sourcing begins in Northern Ghana, in partnership with a local businesswoman named Hajia Limata. The dry spices at the heart of all Essie Spice sauces are sourced from Hajia, who has been working with herbs and spices since she was a little girl. As an adult she began selling them at the Makola Market, the biggest open-air market in Accra, the capital of Ghana. The Makola Market is where Hajia met and began supplying Essie’s mother with spices for export to the United States. Essie was able to experiment with Hajia’s spices in the U.S., and her partnership with Hajia was born. Our dried ginger, our grains of selim, alligator pepper & our West African nutmeg are all sourced directly from her kitchen. The impact of Essie Spice on Hajia’s business in Ghana has been tremendous, enabling her to support & educate both her daughter and her granddaughter. The fresh ingredients in Essie Spice are sourced from produce distributors in the tri-state area that specialize in exotic ingredients, keeping the business local and the supply-chain short. We use fresh ingredients and premium oils like Coconut & Avocado that are healthy, but also great tasting, complementing the rich spices and flavors of West Africa.All Essie Spice sauces are packaged in glass jars to avoid BPA and any contamination that can result from heat transfer from plastics; and all of our packaging is made from recycled glass and cardboard, and is 100% recyclable. We produce the sauces in small batches at a local kitchen incubator to ensure quality and to maintain the personal, hand-made touch that our customers have grown to love and expect. They know who makes their sauce and exactly where their spices come from.Authentic Ghanaian Spices and paired with complementary world flavors. Takes the guess work out of measuring seasoning because all flavor is in there already. Its truly multi-purpose – can serve as a jam, the base for a salad dressing, as a condiment, in a marinade or glaze, and as a cooking sauce and spice blend. They pack a lot of flavor so a small amount goes a long way when cooking your favorite dishesMade in small batches to ensure attention to detail in an incubator certified under all NYC health codes. They are lab-tested & FDA Approved.They are all-natural with no artificial coloring, flavoring, and preservatives, High in minerals, vitamins and antioxidantsThe sauces are low in caloriesNo MSG or fillers                             PRODUCT REVIEWSChef Pierre Thiam - Chef, Restauranteur & Cookbook Author. EssieSpice Coco-for-Garlic is the perfect blend to revive any sauces or stews.  The sweetness from the coconut oil combined with the sharpness of the garlic and the heat from the chili, together make a happy marriage for any ethnic food lovers. Coco-for-Garlic also makes a fine marinade for grilled meat or fish.Tamarind Oh brings a sweet and sour goodness that takes me straight back to my childhood in Dakar where spicy tamarind snacks aka “Dakhar Niambaan”, were sold, wrapped on craft paper, in street corners (by the way, Dakar also means tamarind in Wolof language).My favorite is the Mekko Dry Rub that reminds me of the Hausa spice mixture known as “Kankankan” used on the popular Nigerian grilled meat snack  “Suya”. Mekko Dry Rub can be used as a substitute for the spices on blackened salmon or on grilled steak. It adds a unique intense flavor with subtle hints of Selim pepper.If you are a heat lover (like me!), the Mango Medley is just for you. It‘s the sauce you can carry along when you travel and want to bring that African kick to your food anywhere anytime. There is nothing like hot pepper to open up one’s palate to flavors. Here, the heat from the habanero is balanced with the sweetness of the mango, which also reminds me of those childhood days in Dakar, when, during the rainy season, we couldn’t wait for the mangoes to ripen. We would simply eat them green with salt and dry chili.Essie's creativity is fearless, borrowing flavors from other rich food cultures without compromising with the authenticity of the African flavors. The simplicity and quality of the ingredients are good indicators of the integrity of this new brand.Essie Spice is a welcome addition to the global pantry. Alexander Smalls - Chef/Restaurateur of The Cecil & Minton's Restaurant, NYC Essiespice is an epicurean wake up call for diners in search of flavor... It is not only a spice collection but a movement...a flavor sensation with every bite you take. Essiespice transforms the ordinary...mundane flavor most dishes suffer from, giving them a bold..exciting kick, pushing the boundaries of what flavorful eating is all about...and more. Each Sauce and flavorful spice from the Coco-for garlic...the Tamarind oh, and the Mango Medley...even the very aromatic Mekko dry rub....nothing could be finer than these delightful sauces  spicing up your meat, chicken or fish...not to mention a great vegetarian dip right from the bottle. Essie Spice gives you flavor with each choice you desire.... Pick some up and surprise your taste buds.Emmet Dennis - Chief Branding & Community Commerce Officer- Sundial BrandsWith this dynamic and innovative founder, you will also discover an infectious personality and an amazing work ethic in Essie Bartels. Essie Spice is a culturally authentic product with local global appeal.  The spices and sauce blends #breakthewalls of traditional cooking methods with influences from Asian, Caribbean, and South American, and Europe all in these special bottles. Sauces such as  “Tamarind OH!, Mango Chili Medley, and Coco-for Garlic will entice your tastebuds and enhance your daily dishes.  With a sustainable business model that is passionate about community empowerment and development,  Essie Spice is the next household brand name for your next artisanal food creation.”Chef Michael Zebrowski- Head Pastry Chef; Institute of Culinary Education, NYC.""Essie has always demonstrated great dedication and a positive, mature attitude in her business endeavors. She is industrious and well-focused, and works with a professional mindset.I sampled and enjoyed her sauces and even used them in a few dishes. They were unique, traditional and full of robust flavor. I see her dedication to her business and her culinary education as a testament to the work she has put into the sauces. I look forward to greatness for Essie and her one-of-a-kind sauces.Chef Travis Schultz - Sous Chef; The Mansion at the MGM GrandInspired by the soulful foods of her heritage, Essie Bartels presents EssieSpice to the world. Her top-shelf artisan spice rubs, blends and sauces are inspired by her own family recipes that were passed down through generations. You can really taste the heart in what Essie is doing.  I was offered the wonderful opportunity to sample the EssieSpice product line, to which I was extremely satisfied. You can’t argue with good food, and your taste buds don’t lie. Every product I sampled exceed my expectations and tasted great  – and with food, that’s what matters most at the end of the day. I highly recommend EssieSpice products for anyone wanting to cook great food. The best part about all of the EssieSpice products is that they are ready to go out of the jar; no need for adjustments.  You don’t need to be a great chef to make great food when you have some EssieSpice in your back pocket or pantry. You just need to taste for yourself to understand. That’s real talk.
What Have We
Accomplished So Far?
From year 1 (in 2013) to year 2, Essie Spice doubled the sales
of our Essential Sauce Collection. During this time we also expanded our sales platform
beyond online orders to include six brick-and-mortar stores, farmers’ markets,
in-store demos and pop-up shops. Every Essie Spice in-store demo has resulted
in completely selling out of our on-site inventory.Increased media attention around our popular sauces, a growing social media
following (on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter), and exposure from attendance at
food events around the tri-state (NY, NJ, CT) area has translated to a
consistent growth in demand for Essie Spice sauces and spice blends. We have recently
received inquiries and finally landed shelf space from National Retailers Wholefoods Market and ShopRite Supermarkets. We are currently available for sale in the Brooklyn Wholefoods and the Englewood, NJ ShopRite Store. Wholefoods has over 430 stores and ShopRite has over 250 stores. We need to be able to raise the funds to ramp up production to meet demand. With your support we can grow our business to match this demand and begin
distributing our sauces to even wider audiences on a regional and national
scale.
Since our first year in business, we have donated 10% of the proceeds from our anniversary sale to nonprofit charities that are doing important work in communities around the world. Charities we have supported thus far include Medecins Sans Frontières/Doctors Without Borders, The Abide Family (Uganda), Tatas And Friends (Ghana), The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, and the Kili Summit for Clean Water under the African Development Initiative. As Essie Spice continues to grow our intention is to continue and to expand this important tradition of giving back to our communities.   
What’s the
Money For?
Since 2013 Essie Spice has been a labor of
love, and with the exception of many helpful friends and family, it has also
been a one-woman show. The excitement over and demand for our sauces continue
to grow, and we are poised to scale up our business and meet this need head on.
We plan to allocate resources from this successful campaign to the following business
areas below as we work to put our sauce and spice blends directly in the hands
of more consumers and to make Essie Spice a household name.
· 
Marketing:  
o 
Increase visibility and
social media presence through higher frequency of posts and paid advertisements
o 
Create digital content in
the form of how-to cooking videos
o 
Partner with restaurants
in NYC and beyond to promote brand
o 
Obtain a booth at the
2017 Fancy Food Show at NYC’s Javits Center, a trade show where all major
buyers from national and local grocery stores find small businesses to onboard.  
· 
Staff: 
o 
Hire sales professionals
for in-store demo’s and farmers’ markets
o 
Hire administrative support
staff to help with daily tasks from finances & accounting to processing
orders and making deliverieso Hiring production staff to help in making the sauces once demand spikes. 
·  Warehousing and
Distribution:
o 
Rent a dedicated
warehouse space to store sauces and enable production in larger quantities
o 
Engage a professional distributor
to satisfy growing number of orders placed outside of the tri-state area
o 
Ramp up our production
capacity as we prepare to expand to new Regional Store locations and other retail
supermarket chains. 
· Equipment and Shipping:
o 
Replace household blender
with industrial blender. Production of the Mango Chili Medley and
Coco-For-Garlic sauces each require the blending of hundreds of pounds of
produce – from fresh garlic to onions, Thai chilies, ginger and Scotch bonnet
peppers. An industrial blender will greatly increase our production capacity and
efficiency. 
o 
Acquire other specialized
tools. A seed extractor for our TamarindOH! Sauce will extract seeds at a much
faster pace and with better accuracy than the kitchen sieve we currently use. 
o 
We currently use standard
shipping boxes that are not designed for our jars, which causes quite a number
of accidents during shipping. New shipping boxes, quoted by our manufacturer
and designed with our jars in mind, will fit the jars like a glove and reduce movement
and accidents during shipment
· 
Research and Development:
o 
With a small team
supporting the every day responsibilities of running Essie Spice, Essie can
focus on conducting more research and introducing new and exciting products to
the brand. Potential new products include the launch of four spice blends that
will represent the four corners of Africa; East, West, South and North. Essie
is also developing signature Essie Spice Milks, Nuts, Butters and Oils, that
currently cannot be found anywhere but the African continent. Essie is also currently in talks with farmers in the Northern Regions of Ghana to introduce ancient grains like Millet, Sorghum and Fonio which have high nutritional value but are unavailable on the market. And she has also
begun working with artisans and producers in Kumasi, Ghana to develop the Essie
Spice Aprons and Pottery collection. Investing in and partnering with these
artisans, who will receive all revenue directly, will impact their livelihoods
and the livelihoods of entire communities in Kumasi.
For one little girl, the journey started in her mother's tiny
kitchen in Ghana where her love affair with spice was ignited. Her
flavorful journey continued all over the globe, spurred by her insatiable
appetite for travel. She played with exotic palates; she tested cuisines,
she concocted condiments. As her experiments with spices grew, so did the
demand for her homemade sauces which all boiled down to what you now find in
this jar: bottled up joy handed down through three generations to spice up your
life. That little girl was Essie, and this is Essie Spice.
Spread the Spice Gospel
We have invested so much time and money to bring Essiespice to market. Now we need your support to get these sauces and other products of African origin to each household in America and beyond. Thanks so much for learning about Essie Spice,
and for your support. Please spread the word about our campaign!

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>Hello, my name is Adam Mhrez and I am here to tell you about “Reliant
Credit Repair”.  Getting denied by a
bank, lender or even department store for a loan can be deflating.  You have paid you bills on time most of the
time, you don’t know what you did or can do to get into the world of borrowing.  The hardest part about credit is learning all
the ins and outs of the credit score and most importantly how do you fix
it.  Having bad credit can keep you from
getting a car, a home and yes even certain jobs. </p>

word “denied” is an awful, helpless feeling. That is why I have created “Reliant Credit
Repair” and now anyone can easily and effectively fix their credit with our

dedicated to helping people clean up their credit score so they can apply for
the car or home of their dreams without the worries of being denied. </p>

like-minded people for collaboration, raise money in exchange for early access
and rewards, and we also want to spread the word.  The more people we can get using “Reliant
Credit Repair” the more functional and successful it will be.  So this campaign will give you the basics on
our efforts and progress.  Beyond that we
encourage you to ask us questions, donate and get involved.  We developed “Reliant Credit Repair” for your

really onto an easier way to fix your credit with a fraction of the work.</p>

 The Impact:

The social way of doing business is at the core of how we want to impact people's mentality. As we said, all the profit will be maintained into the operational and investing activities and we will also arrange a partnership with an Non-Profit Organization in order to create a synergy between us and the organization chosen. 

 Challenges
 During the conception and application of our project we will have many challenges and it would be a real pleasure to outwork them, here are some of them to give you a global picture of what we need to do:       1) Conceptualisation: Build a solid framework that rely on social values.       2) Gather Information: Expand our knowledge on the different options of making our products made with insects.       3) Conceive the Ideal Product: Get in touch with many experts to conceive the ideal products, such as cooks, nutritionist and scientist.       4) Build a Social Network: Get in touch with all the supplier chain in order to make sure they fit with our social mind set that will reduce negative extarnality produce by our activity.       5) Market the Business: Inform our potential consumers through different sources of media: social media, email, and be to be that will take place into different environment, such as college, university, sport events and many others.

<p>We started <a href=""http://www.tomcridland.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tom Cridland</a>, our fashion brand, with a £6,000 government start-up loan 2 years ago when we were 23. We have campaigned extensively for sustainability in the industry with <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tomcridland/the-30-year-sweatshirt"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The 30 Year Sweatshirt</a> and designing clothing is true labour of love for us.</p>
<p>We are keen to give back and support aspiring young entrepreneurs, as well as those in the developing world who deserve the opportunity to start businesses and work their way out of poverty. We also want to campaign for a greater focus on nurturing entrepreneurial talent and providing basic business training in our education systems across the world.</p>
<p>In this spirit, 5% of The Entrepreneur’s Shirt campaign will be donated to <a href=""https://www.young-enterprise.org.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Young Enterprise</a> to inspire and equip young people in Britain to learn and succeed through entrepreneurial endeavour. Based on research statistics published by FreshMinds, students who participate in Young Enterprise programmes have a better understanding of business than their peers and are twice as likely to start-up their own company. </p>
<p>Small businesses are the lifeblood of any healthy economy and, yet, in the developing world it is nigh on impossible for many people to have the chance to work their way out of poverty through entrepreneurship. </p>
<p><a href=""http://www.deki.org.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">DEKI</a> is a revolutionary charity that changes that and a further 5% of The Entrepreneur’s Shirt campaign will also be donated to them to help them give people in countries like this the chance to create sustainable livelihoods by providing access to micro-grants and business training.</p>

<p><strong>About Young Enterprise</strong></p>
<p>There’s a crisis in the UK. Youth unemployment is having a devastating impact on today’s young people. With 70% of employers reporting that school leavers are not work ready and nearly one million young people without a job, we want to ensure that the talent and potential of our young people is not lost. In order to do this we need to address the lack of practical business education in our schools and create a skilled and prepared workforce. </p>
<p>We believe each young person should leave education having developed skills and experience in communication, team working, problem solving, creativity and resilience which can be developed through Young Enterprise. Their programmes offer a journey from gaining knowledge through to developing skills and changing attitudes, arming young people with the confidence to aim high and the knowledge and skills to succeed. Today’s young people are facing an uncertain future. Each year Young Enterprise empowers over 200,000 under 25s to realise their potential, but there are hundreds of thousands more who need their help.</p>
<p>5% of your pledge for The Entrepreneur's Shirt will go directly to giving young people in the UK invaluable business training, something Tom Cridland want to support as the brand itself was started with a £6,000 government start-up loan just two years ago.</p>

<p><strong>About DEKI</strong></p>
<p>Right now millions of families around the world are facing a daily struggle of poverty. This means parents are unable to afford regular meals, clean water, basic healthcare and education for their children. 18% of children in Uganda never go to school and 66% will never complete their education. In Malawi, 50% of children under five are suffering from malnutrition. To compound this daily struggle, social inequalities often block individual's. In South Sudan, for example, women are unable to access bank loans to help kick-start their their businesses due to gender discrimination. </p>
<p>DEKI is a microfinance charity that believes in opportunity not poverty. They provide ethical micro-loans and business training to people in Africa offering a vital hand up rather than a handout. Through DEKI, individual lenders have the opportunity to lend from just £10 directly via the crowdfunding website deki.org.uk. 100% of all money lent goes directly to the chosen entrepreneur and lenders are paid on average in 12 months. Even a small initial investment can help a number of people to raise themselves out of poverty. With the capital to start a business, DEKI entrepreneurs cannot only turn their lives around, they can lift others around them out of poverty too. This is shown through improved communal access to secure sources of food and clean water, education, healthcare and employment.</p>
<p>5% of your pledge for The Entrepreneur's Shirt will go directly to an entrepreneur in the developing world as a micro-grant and not a micro-loan, as Tom Cridland do not expect to be repaid for their donation to DEKI.</p>

<p>Tom has been designing clothing since the age of 18, when he sold nearly £3,000 worth of ""SWINE 09"" t-shirts in a single week of school and donated all the profits to Médecins Sans Frontières.</p>
<p>In January 2014, aged 23, he founded <a href=""http://www.tomcridland.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Tom Cridland</a>, specialising solely in creating the perfect pair of trousers. He quickly built a vertical luxury menswear brand that specialises in what <a href=""http://video.cnbc.com/gallery/?video=3000409085"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">CNBC</a> describe as ""quality over quantity retail"". Tom believes that retail markups are inefficient and unfair on the customer, who ends up paying higher prices for no reason.</p>
<p>Tom founded his eponymous menswear brand upon the simple principle of making truly luxurious clothing and selling it direct to customer online and, as <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jun/09/the-sweatshirt-that-lasts-for-30-years-the-great-new-eco-brands"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">THE GUARDIAN</a> said, ""high-spec material and production seem to be his thing"". </p>

</div></div>","We started Tom Cridland, our fashion brand, with a £6,000 government start-up loan 2 years ago when we were 23. We have campaigned extensively for sustainability in the industry with The 30 Year Sweatshirt and designing clothing is true labour of love for us.
We are keen to give back and support aspiring young entrepreneurs, as well as those in the developing world who deserve the opportunity to start businesses and work their way out of poverty. We also want to campaign for a greater focus on nurturing entrepreneurial talent and providing basic business training in our education systems across the world.
In this spirit, 5% of The Entrepreneur’s Shirt campaign will be donated to Young Enterprise to inspire and equip young people in Britain to learn and succeed through entrepreneurial endeavour. Based on research statistics published by FreshMinds, students who participate in Young Enterprise programmes have a better understanding of business than their peers and are twice as likely to start-up their own company. 
Small businesses are the lifeblood of any healthy economy and, yet, in the developing world it is nigh on impossible for many people to have the chance to work their way out of poverty through entrepreneurship. 
DEKI is a revolutionary charity that changes that and a further 5% of The Entrepreneur’s Shirt campaign will also be donated to them to help them give people in countries like this the chance to create sustainable livelihoods by providing access to micro-grants and business training.

Together we can provide greater support to aspiring entrepreneurs who need it and lead a trend towards greater business training in our education systems. As our video demonstrates, this will only be possible with your help!

<p>IT'S OUR MOST EXCITING SEASON YET! Hard to believe we're launching our 10th season. Incredible. It's been an amazing year: we dedicated ourselves to building infrastructure: hiring 2 staff members, increasing our annual budget by $20,000 and paying more of our artists. And the impact has been HUGE! Not only is the organization running a lot more smoothly but our events are more powerful and more packed than ever. (Funny how that works...)<br/><br/>This coming season, we've got even more fantastic stuff coming up: we're moving to a new, larger venue in NYC. On top of all that, we'll be presenting more performance, visual art, food, live music, games, community interaction, storytelling and all of the other juicy stuff that folks have come to expect from our events.<br/><br/>WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO? This campaign accounts for 20% of our annual budget. But how does that break down, exactly? We'll tell you.</p>
<p>$25 -- pays for gas and partial tolls for Chris and Bobby to drive into NY city for each monthly service--one way!</p>
<p>$50 --covers childcare for one service.</p>
<p>$100 -- pays for a stage manager for one service.</p>
<p>$150 -- pays for two featured performers or one session of rehearsal space.</p>
<p>$200 -- covers the costs of one coffee hour.</p>
<p>$500 -- covers our rent for one service.</p>
<p>$1000 -- covers musicians and artists for one month. Or, pays for airfare and rental car for Chris and Bobby to get to LA.</p>
<p>$2500 -- covers half the cost of one service.</p>
<p>THE IMPACT. The Secret City continues to grow in the most amazing ways. Thousands of people have taken part in our events in NYC, LA and Woodstock. We've done so much with the participation of our amazing donors and friends. With your continued support, we'll continue to present the most exciting mix of artists and performers and to make the events that only The Secret City can make,providing community interaction, artistic engagement and our own special brand of spiritual haven to artists and art lovers.</p>
<p>WHAT ARE THE RISKS TO THIS CAMPAIGN SUCCEEDING? You may be thinking, ""Hey, The Secret City is  a non-profit corporation now with a growing annual budget, why do they still need me?"" The truth is, yes, we've been growing steadily since we started, but we still depend on this annual crowd-fund.

</div><p>THANKS! We're gonna go BIG this season and we're are so excited to have you continue the amazing, joyful, colorful ride with us. THANK YOU for being such a vital part of our program, our growth, our exciting new season: thank you for beingOUR COMMUNITY. <br/><br/>With love.<br/><br/>Chris Wells<br/>Founding Artistic Director</p></div>","IT'S OUR MOST EXCITING SEASON YET! Hard to believe we're launching our 10th season. Incredible. It's been an amazing year: we dedicated ourselves to building infrastructure: hiring 2 staff members, increasing our annual budget by $20,000 and paying more of our artists. And the impact has been HUGE! Not only is the organization running a lot more smoothly but our events are more powerful and more packed than ever. (Funny how that works...)This coming season, we've got even more fantastic stuff coming up: we're moving to a new, larger venue in NYC. On top of all that, we'll be presenting more performance, visual art, food, live music, games, community interaction, storytelling and all of the other juicy stuff that folks have come to expect from our events.WHERE DOES THE MONEY GO? This campaign accounts for 20% of our annual budget. But how does that break down, exactly? We'll tell you.
$25 -- pays for gas and partial tolls for Chris and Bobby to drive into NY city for each monthly service--one way!
$50 --covers childcare for one service.
$100 -- pays for a stage manager for one service.
$150 -- pays for two featured performers or one session of rehearsal space.
$200 -- covers the costs of one coffee hour.
$500 -- covers our rent for one service.
$1000 -- covers musicians and artists for one month. Or, pays for airfare and rental car for Chris and Bobby to get to LA.
$2500 -- covers half the cost of one service.
THE IMPACT. The Secret City continues to grow in the most amazing ways. Thousands of people have taken part in our events in NYC, LA and Woodstock. We've done so much with the participation of our amazing donors and friends. With your continued support, we'll continue to present the most exciting mix of artists and performers and to make the events that only The Secret City can make,providing community interaction, artistic engagement and our own special brand of spiritual haven to artists and art lovers.

<p>Ever thought that consumer drones focused on features that seemed to compliment only the extreme lifestyles?</p>
<p>We certainly do, and because of this we are working hard to make professional level drone technology available to everyone at a more practical level, focusing on portability, sharing, ease-of-use, and fun that is available literally out of the box.</p>

<h4><span style=""background-color: initial;"">The Loop Drone = Portability</span></h4>
<p> </p>
<p>No bigger than the size of a standard Tablet, The Loop is both easy to store and quick to operate. The automatic folding arms mechanism allows for easy practical storage, offering simple assembly that will have you flying high in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p>That’s the blurb, but what does it really mean?</p>
<p>Well for one thing, The Loop is much more portable than other drones at this level, meaning that there is no real need for dedicated suitcases for transport! But if you were the type that enjoys ‘everything in its place’, then we have designed a slimline bag that comes with every ‘family-pack’ purchase, which is smaller than your standard backpack!</p>

<p><b>Portable Gimbal System = Practicality</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Loop’s undercarriage can be detached and assembled to our portable Gimbal System we call the GIMA 1.0. Extremely useful for when you need fast professional hand-held photography. Re-attach to the drone with very little effort, and take your photography back to the skies.</p>
<p>That’s the blurb, but what does it really mean?</p>
<p>Well basically, the drone comes with its own gimbal system which can be detached to form the GIMA Hand-held Gimbal. This system gives you functionality that matches other high-end portable gimbals, but without the cost. The GIMA is formed using the undercarriage of the drone itself, and means that you are not only able to take extremely steady recordings in the skies, but also on the ground. With the GIMA, steady hands are not required.</p>

<p><b>FPV Goggles = Sharing</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Immerse yourself in the world of FPV, as our ‘SuperView’ goggles place you directly into the pilot’s seat. The HD FPV experience captured by our own 4k Action Camera, means that you can experience the sense of flying in all its majesty, allowing your imagination to run wild, and to wonder… ‘Is this how a superhero see’s the world?’. Turn on the Live Sharing feature and invite your friends &amp; family to ‘see what you see’ from anywhere in the world using our Smart APP.</p>
<p>That’s the blurb, but what does it really mean?</p>
<p>Well put simply, the FPV Goggles (called SuperView) give you a view from the drone itself as it flies, so make sure you’re sitting down comfortably! Installing our APP means that you can turn on live streaming on your smartphone which fits neatly in the SuperView’s casing, and share live video to anywhere around the world… so granny can enjoy your experiences while sitting by the fire.</p>

<p><b>Light-Finger Sky-Writing = FUN!!!</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Expand your creativity with our ‘Light-Finger Sky-Writing’ feature, which provides an unprecedented level of control. With just a swipe of your finger, you can have The Loop zooming, swooping and looping around the skies with an ever increasing beauty of light and shape.</p>
<p>That’s the blurb, but what does it really mean?</p>
<p>Well put simply, you are able to draw whatever shapes in whatever color you desire, and press GO! The Loop will take off and automatically draw your images in the night-sky for you, leaving you to concentrate on the photographs. Can it be easier than that?</p>

<h3><b>EVOLUTION</b></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>We work hard to make sure that we are always moving forward, enhancing features or correcting issues. This is why the Loop is continuously evolving.</p>
<p>The concept that pushed us to develop The Loop drone is simple…</p>
<p>Many drone products in the market come across as either being too professional or gimmicky, and led us to come up with our own drone tackling the issues of portability, ease-of-use, and FUN!!!</p>
<p>We wanted a drone that bridged the gap, and gave families a practical option that not only could go toe-to-toe with some of the best, but would not break the bank. More than that, a drone that came with features and accessories in an all-in-one pack that made the experience as easy and pain free as possible.</p>
<p>‘Family Values with Professional standards’, as The Loop represents our passion and belief of making drone technology more family friendly.</p>

<h3><b>WHY XENOSKY IS DIFFERENT</b></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Unlike many other drone companies, we are not trying to change the world through constant technical innovation, our goals are different. We just want to provide ways to make drone technology and experiences more accessible to the mass market.</p>
<p>By focusing on this, we are able to ensure that our products present more practical and viable solutions to those who just want to enjoy the fun aspects of aerial photography at professional levels, without breaking the bank.</p>
<p>Located across 2 continents (America and Asia), we are a collection of professionals who are working hard to match what the market wants. As such we are always open to input, so please talk to us... <b>We are listening.</b></p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><b>WE NEED YOU</b></h3>

<p> </p>
<p>Although we are a small but dedicated team who has worked extremely hard to make the Loop a reality, we are not there yet.</p>
<p>But what will we do with your money?</p>
<p>Your donations will enable us complete our project and bring drone technology down to earth... sounds odd, but we feel that drones are not as easily accessible, fun to use or as practical in everyday lives as they should be.</p>
<p>So we want to address this and make 'The World's First Family Drone' a reality...  help us make this happen.</p>

<p>We have come up with a range of donation choices for you, and hope that the rewards on offer more than show our commitment to saying a special ‘thank you’ to everyone who supports us.</p>
<p>More than that, we are a company that values your input, and welcome any suggestions you may have for us to move forward… seriously, send us a comment, an email, a postcard if you wish!</p>

<h3>FAQs</h3>
<div><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Here are 5 questions that we have already been asked, even before our campaign had begun! So we thought we would add them as FAQs from the beginning, but watch out for more as the campaign grows.</span></div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<ul><li><b>1 - When will the Loop be available?</b></li></ul>
<div><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Our target month is July 2016, and we are full steam ahead to achieving this. If there is any issue that comes up, you all will be the first to know.</span></div>
<div> </div>
<ul><li><b>2 - Can I control the Loop using my Smart device?</b></li></ul>
<div><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Absolutely! One of our features that we are working on is control using Smart Devices. It will be part of our APP offering and will cover iOS and later on Android, so watch out for the updates!</span></div>
<div> </div>
<ul><li><b>3 - Where is your company located?</b></li></ul>
<div><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">We are located in two countries, in both California USA and Shenzhen China. Our contact details are listed in this campaign and you are more than welcome to contact us.</span></div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<ul><li><b>4 - Why are you crowdfunding?</b></li></ul>
<div style=""font-weight: normal;"">Well, we have done almost all of the hard work already. We are now at the point where we will focus on finishing our targets and start mass manufacturing for the global markets. This needs a certain level of investment, and gives us an opportunity to showcase our project to you before launch day comes.</div>
<div style=""font-weight: normal;""> </div>

Say HELLO to THE LOOP!
 The World's First Family Drone 
 
...
 
Ever considered that today’s consumer drones are either too professional or gimmicky for everyday family use? 
Ever thought that consumer drones focused on features that seemed to compliment only the extreme lifestyles?
We certainly do, and because of this we are working hard to make professional level drone technology available to everyone at a more practical level, focusing on portability, sharing, ease-of-use, and fun that is available literally out of the box.
 
The Loop – A Family Drone at Professional Levels


What makes The Loop the family drone?
Simple, we have developed the Loop to offer features that reflect the values that families hold dear in todays world. 
To reflect this, The Loop embodies the four family values that XenoSky follow…
 


This doesn't mean that the Loop is just another gimmicky drone toy that isn't taken seriously... not at all. In fact, we have designed The Loop to also offer professional level features and functionality that any drone enthusiast can take advantage of. In fact, the Loop is the world's first drone that offers features attractive to all consumer levels, from fun n games to professional photography... The Loop can do it all, without destroying father’s pocket book!

 

The World's First Family Drone
 

The Loop is packed with the usual features found on all professional level consumer drones, but with added functionality that makes flying the drone attractive to all who want to have fun and share their experiences with friends and family.
 

This is why the Loop comes featured as part of our Family Pack!
 
 

The Family Pack - 1: The Loop Drone, 2: The GiMA 1.0 Hand-Held Gimbal, 3: The Slimline Bag, 4: SuperView FPV Goggles, 5: APP Supporting Light-Finger Sky-Writing, 6: Our 4k Action Camera

...

Family Pack Features:
 

The Loop Drone = Portability
 
No bigger than the size of a standard Tablet, The Loop is both easy to store and quick to operate. The automatic folding arms mechanism allows for easy practical storage, offering simple assembly that will have you flying high in a matter of minutes.
That’s the blurb, but what does it really mean?
Well for one thing, The Loop is much more portable than other drones at this level, meaning that there is no real need for dedicated suitcases for transport! But if you were the type that enjoys ‘everything in its place’, then we have designed a slimline bag that comes with every ‘family-pack’ purchase, which is smaller than your standard backpack!
Foldable Storage!
 

Fit in Many Small to Medium Sized Bags

Portable Gimbal System = Practicality
 
The Loop’s undercarriage can be detached and assembled to our portable Gimbal System we call the GIMA 1.0. Extremely useful for when you need fast professional hand-held photography. Re-attach to the drone with very little effort, and take your photography back to the skies.
That’s the blurb, but what does it really mean?
Well basically, the drone comes with its own gimbal system which can be detached to form the GIMA Hand-held Gimbal. This system gives you functionality that matches other high-end portable gimbals, but without the cost. The GIMA is formed using the undercarriage of the drone itself, and means that you are not only able to take extremely steady recordings in the skies, but also on the ground. With the GIMA, steady hands are not required.

Our 4k Action Camera - Front
 

 

 
 

FPV Goggles = Sharing
 
Immerse yourself in the world of FPV, as our ‘SuperView’ goggles place you directly into the pilot’s seat. The HD FPV experience captured by our own 4k Action Camera, means that you can experience the sense of flying in all its majesty, allowing your imagination to run wild, and to wonder… ‘Is this how a superhero see’s the world?’. Turn on the Live Sharing feature and invite your friends & family to ‘see what you see’ from anywhere in the world using our Smart APP.
That’s the blurb, but what does it really mean?
Well put simply, the FPV Goggles (called SuperView) give you a view from the drone itself as it flies, so make sure you’re sitting down comfortably! Installing our APP means that you can turn on live streaming on your smartphone which fits neatly in the SuperView’s casing, and share live video to anywhere around the world… so granny can enjoy your experiences while sitting by the fire.

 



  
 

 
Light-Finger Sky-Writing = FUN!!!
 
Expand your creativity with our ‘Light-Finger Sky-Writing’ feature, which provides an unprecedented level of control. With just a swipe of your finger, you can have The Loop zooming, swooping and looping around the skies with an ever increasing beauty of light and shape.
That’s the blurb, but what does it really mean?
Well put simply, you are able to draw whatever shapes in whatever color you desire, and press GO! The Loop will take off and automatically draw your images in the night-sky for you, leaving you to concentrate on the photographs. Can it be easier than that?

Please note: The Controller used in the video is our testing controller and we are currently manufacturing a new controller design.
 
Standard LOOP FEATURES
 

 
NOTE: Many of the features listed above are currently in development, and we need your help to complete. If you feel as we do and want to see these features realized and the drone successfully launched, please donate by using one of our fabulous listed options!  
EVOLUTION
 
We work hard to make sure that we are always moving forward, enhancing features or correcting issues. This is why the Loop is continuously evolving.
The concept that pushed us to develop The Loop drone is simple…
Many drone products in the market come across as either being too professional or gimmicky, and led us to come up with our own drone tackling the issues of portability, ease-of-use, and FUN!!!
We wanted a drone that bridged the gap, and gave families a practical option that not only could go toe-to-toe with some of the best, but would not break the bank. More than that, a drone that came with features and accessories in an all-in-one pack that made the experience as easy and pain free as possible.
‘Family Values with Professional standards’, as The Loop represents our passion and belief of making drone technology more family friendly.
 





3D Folded


3D in 'Flight' Mode



 
 
Many early morning hours were spent going over the initial designs, as we wanted something portable while remaining strong and reliable. 

3D Printing of Prototype Underway!

Putting the Loop Together

Our First Prototype- 3D Printed


The First Loop Prototypes Constructed - Without the Gimbal
With designs complete and confidence high, we were ready to construct our first prototype… it was an exciting day with great eagerness to get flying! 

The Loop - Size Comparison
 Our first flight!  

 
Early Battery Tests
We decided to add an active and easy to read LED display to show remaining power levels of the battery, with alarm notification for charging.

 
WHY XENOSKY IS DIFFERENT
 
Unlike many other drone companies, we are not trying to change the world through constant technical innovation, our goals are different. We just want to provide ways to make drone technology and experiences more accessible to the mass market.
By focusing on this, we are able to ensure that our products present more practical and viable solutions to those who just want to enjoy the fun aspects of aerial photography at professional levels, without breaking the bank.
Located across 2 continents (America and Asia), we are a collection of professionals who are working hard to match what the market wants. As such we are always open to input, so please talk to us... We are listening.
 
 
 
WE NEED YOU

 
Although we are a small but dedicated team who has worked extremely hard to make the Loop a reality, we are not there yet.
But what will we do with your money?
Your donations will enable us complete our project and bring drone technology down to earth... sounds odd, but we feel that drones are not as easily accessible, fun to use or as practical in everyday lives as they should be.
So we want to address this and make 'The World's First Family Drone' a reality...  help us make this happen.
We need your help to get us past the finish line. How to help? Simple… donate!
We have come up with a range of donation choices for you, and hope that the rewards on offer more than show our commitment to saying a special ‘thank you’ to everyone who supports us.
More than that, we are a company that values your input, and welcome any suggestions you may have for us to move forward… seriously, send us a comment, an email, a postcard if you wish!

FAQs
Here are 5 questions that we have already been asked, even before our campaign had begun! So we thought we would add them as FAQs from the beginning, but watch out for more as the campaign grows.
 

1 - When will the Loop be available?
Our target month is July 2016, and we are full steam ahead to achieving this. If there is any issue that comes up, you all will be the first to know.
 
2 - Can I control the Loop using my Smart device?
Absolutely! One of our features that we are working on is control using Smart Devices. It will be part of our APP offering and will cover iOS and later on Android, so watch out for the updates!
 
3 - Where is your company located?
We are located in two countries, in both California USA and Shenzhen China. Our contact details are listed in this campaign and you are more than welcome to contact us.
 

4 - Why are you crowdfunding?
Well, we have done almost all of the hard work already. We are now at the point where we will focus on finishing our targets and start mass manufacturing for the global markets. This needs a certain level of investment, and gives us an opportunity to showcase our project to you before launch day comes.
 
5 - Do I need to register for a UAS license from the FAA to fly?
Yes, but we can help you with that. Each person who purchases one of our perks containing a drone, will be supported by us to help register your UAS license. If you want to find out more, please go here... https://www.faa.gov/uas/registration/

 
6 - Why doesn't the Goggles or Hand-Held Gimbal come with the Early Bird Packs?
Both the SuperView FPV Goggles and the Hand-Held Gimbal (GiMA) are separate items, and therefore are extra cost to manufacture. Because of this, they are included as one-stop-shop complete solution that we call, The Family Pack!
 
 
7 - Does the Loop Drone support most action cams on the market?Yes. The Hand-Held Gimbal and the Drone itself supports all popular action cams in the market today. This includes the GoPro Hero ranges of Camera. 
 
8 - Will the controller come with the Drone?Yes. The look of the controller is currently in development and is the reason there is no pictures to show yet, but when they are available we will show them on the updates!
Please contact us directly if you have further questions

</div></div>","If user want to offer or receive help the process is as easy as 1-2-3. He or she login to www.tobekind.net and enter a wonderful experience. Here is philosophy of service ToBeKind:
 


 


Using the service is very straightforward. There are two ways people can connect. Let’s check them out:
 

 
 


 



There’s the joy that comes from good deeds. There are three main elements on our web service, that work in the system to motivate people to be kind on our web service and inspire them to help other people without money. It creates our system of rewards.  

The video below is very explanatory concerning how ToBeKind works in real action.
 




 


Any Internet user who needs or wants to help online. No matter what kind of help user provide: local or remote. The location barrier is disappears via our web service. Imagine someone who needs a French language tutor and he/she lives in the small town where there is none who can help. Imagine now that someone in the French countryside is eager to help. This is the situation where ToBeKind comes in. The good deeds link up. ToBeKind connects them and help is provided.
ToBeKind makes it possible! 
Some indicative needs for online help are: lessons, domestic help, consultation, donation of things and much more.


Sometimes, when we need assistance we feel helpless, we believe that there is no one out there to help. No need to feel that way. One of the fundamental stones of ToBeKind project is the belief that there are people eager to help spread all over the world. And because there are several people who wish to help, you may choose the one that can best meet your needs and thank the others. Moreover, you can do your own research on the platform and locate a specialist that can help.
ToBeKind project works the other way round too. Do you wish to offer your help? Create a task with your expertise and wait for people who need your specialization to respond. You can also check the list of people asking for some help and offer your assistance — good deed, indeed! We also have a rewarding system for users who provide help and do kind things on ToBeKind project.

Do you remember that  “Not Again!” moment when you jump into the
shower, turn on the water and you suddenly discover the soap left in the soap
case is barely enough to wash your face not to talk of your entire body.

At this point, you have an option of jumping
out of the shower wet to risk falling or sustaining injuries, or just wash
your face with water, and you know the rest…..
According to a recent survey, an average
middle-aged individual does not jump into the shower until thereabout few minutes
before its time to leave the house, and monitoring the level of soap in the
shower is hardly on their to-do list.
Soap Stacker is a multiple bar soap dispenser
that can hold up to 4 bars of soap in the shower at any given time.
The product is cleverly designed to prevent the
steam and water in the shower area from getting into the case, protecting the soap that is not currently in use.
It is easy to use, and fits perfectly on any
bathroom wall be it glass, or plastic. 
It is economical, transferable, and needs no
technical expertise.
All you have to do is just clean and stick
the case to the wall of your shower area, open the case side to load the bar
soap, reserve the last bar for the “in-use” space at the bottom of the case.


Also, you can hang your sponge or washcloth
under the dispenser to avoid cluttering your shower area. 


Where Do You Come In?

 I need your support, backing and donations to bring this product to the market. 
Here are the steps taken and completed so far:



The patent has been filed and fully paid for.

Several prototypes have been made to ensure a high quality and functional product is made.
Tooling has been fully paid for, and completed.
Mass production stage - your backing and support is needed to complete this stage

Your Impact
 Bar soap usage and acceptability is currently making a 360 U-turn with the advent of natural and specialty soap products.
Soap Stacker cannot come at a better time than this, as many bar soap producers have attested to the viability of the product and I'm looking forward to getting this fantastic product into the bathroom wall of bar soap users around the world.
I am also looking forward to launching bar soap as a gift item for occasions like House warming, Birthdays, Baby showers, etc.
Backing this project will go a long way in making this dream a reality, and your support will be rewarded with the product as soon as it lands in our fulfillment center.

All the expenses on the project up till this moment have been fully paid for without sourcing for assistance or support elsewhere.
I have sourced everywhere around the world to find a manufacturer that can produce a safe product at the cheapest possible price.
Not all plastic materials are safe; I have sourced for top quality PC material to be used in the final production.    Other Ways You Can Help I appreciate your time, support, encouragement and trust.

<h2>Why scoleoo? </h2>
<p>Have you ever been to a foreign city trying to find something worth doing … quickly? Imagine you and your family looking for a playground or a saturday afternoon activity, you on a business trip having one evening for yourself. You know there is something close by that would fit your needs. There has to be! But how do you find it? Well, you „ask“ the internet. … for hours. Finally the kids are screaming, the evening gets too late, you are annoyed and tired and most likely you end up somewhere where you don’t like it. That was it: your time! Shouldn’t there be a solution for the question: <u>How do I find something quickly, that is worth doing, that is easy to reach and that fits the exact time gap available?</u></p>
<p><strong>Our free time leaves opportunities for having great times. It should be enjoyed. This time is precious. This time is yours. It is nothing to be wasted.</strong></p>
<p>And yet people spend a lot of time just searching for things that they consider worth doing. On the other hand there are a lot of neat things to do, that people often don’t find. </p>
<p><strong>We think this needs to be changed! </strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481320532/jc0w0gzx1doaw0lghiyp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<h3>What you get </h3>
<p><strong>Scoleoo is our attempt to offer a complete overview about possible activities. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Everywhere. </strong></p>
<p><strong>For everyone.</strong></p>
<p>We go beyond the metropoles and big events. It's about all day distractions like a good path to take a walk, a local sports game, an amateur theater playing, a library, social gatherings like regional festivals. These things are relevant for communities that seek to become fellowships. These things are relevant for integration. Not only for refugees, but also for those who moved within a country or who just changed life situations. As a parent you need to know about other things than before and as a senior you won't bother about going to playgrounds. People change and they permanently have to learn. Why not learn from one another? </p>
<p><strong>Scoleoo would like to become a helpful tool that enables everyone to share ideas, to inform and to inspire people when it comes to their free time planning. </strong></p>
<h2><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481320806/izw9j138vxnrkpnsnqdx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h2>
<h2><strong>How we do that? </strong></h2>
<p>Scoleoo will reduce the information about activities to what is necessary. This allows us to cut down the use of any language to a minimum, in order to make scoleoo usable universally. It also opens the possibility to cover peripheral regions with our service, because it requires less editorial work. </p>
<p>Scoleoo will use this standardized data to create a very efficient search. <strong>In contrast to other event platforms we take in account the timeframe the searching person has and the timeframe the activity is going to occupy.</strong> The results you get will show only those activities that you are able to do. Because everything else is not relevant. You will be able to make a good decision within minutes!<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1481321170/thv05zptbn025zvrtub7.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>By matching the time slots we will create a <strong>timeline in wich you can arrange multiple activities by drag and drop.</strong> Organizing a trip to an unknown region becomes extremely easy.</p>

<p>On top of that we plan additional services, such as providing traffic informations, ticket selling, reservations or cooperations with taxi agencies to make scoleoo a real one-stop-platform for leisure time planning. </p>
<p> </p>
<h2>What else is great</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Our pricing system prevents small players from being outcompeeted</strong> and opens doors for those who are always in the shadow. Uncommercial posts and displaying basic informations will be for free. Commercial posts cost 1,99€ per event/opening day or less. All these payed posts will have the same size and will be shown in the same way. Our goal is to create the possibility of gaining customers for an event for all players and to make our site attractive for them by offering a fair marketplace . </li>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Dance Marathon is a charitable organization that last year raised $1,201,216 for an amazing cause. However this charity has come at a price: the physical well being and sanity of the over 1,000 dancers who participate in the marathon. By raising $1,201,217 (just one dollar more than last year's amount), Sherman Ave hopes to free these dancers from the prison of their own creation, and finally end Dance Marathon, once and for all. With your donation, not only will you be giving money to a good cause, but you will be sending a clear message to Dance Marathon and their inhumane labor practices. Plus more importantly, you won't have to do Dance Marathon! And isn't that a reward in itself?</p>

<p>We are looking to raise one dollar more than the 2016 Dance Marathon, proving once and for all that you don't have to dance to raise money for charity. What a novel concept! If you donate, here's where your money is going:</p>
<ul>
<li>75% of profits will go to GiGi's Playhouse, the only nationwide network of Down syndrome achievement centers for children and adults with Down syndrome, offering free educational and therapeutic programs that unleash confidence and promote continuous improvement. Through these programs, campaigns and community engagements, GiGi’s aims to change the world’s outdated perception of individuals with Down syndrome in a movement toward global acceptance for people of all abilities. You can learn more info <a href=""https://gigisplayhouse.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here.</a>
</li>
<li>25% of profits will go to Sherman Ave website maintenance so we can keep up the fight against injustice, wherever and whenever duty may call. Heh, duty. </li>
</ul>
<p>Plus, we have some perks for you for donating:</p>
<ul><li>If you donate $5 to our campaign, you will receive a ""0 Hour Club"" sticker, created and designed by Sherman Ave! Put it on your laptop, your water bottle, or even your cat! Let the world know that you haven't done DM, and you're not afraid to show it!</li></ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Once we free these dancers from their prison-tent, they'll finally be able to live their lives without being burdened by the need to dance to ""Mr. Brightside"" or having to change into a different arbitrary theme every 3 hours. And more importantly, we will never have to have another Dance Marathon, ending the blight that has plagued this campus for the past 42 years. </p>
<p>Here are just a few of the things that these dancers will be able to do instead of dancing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eating</li>
<li>Sleeping</li>
<li>Finally write that play they've been putting off</li>
<li>Watch at least 3 seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. That finale-- OMG!</li>
<li>Travel to Australia. Say hi to the kangaroos for me!</li>
<li>Tell the man of their dreams they love him and then spend the remaining 29 hours making sweet sweet love</li>
<li>Creating a beautiful and intricate sand sculpture, then taking that sculpture apart, grain by grain, as a representation of the splendor of the fleeting nature of life and our reality </li>
<li>Not dancing</li>
</ul>
<p>Wow! It would almost be a crime NOT to donate!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Dance Marathon is probably going to have a fit when they see this. Oh well!</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<p>So please consider donating to this worthy cause. And keep on not dancing!!!!</p>
</div></div>","Short Summary
Dance Marathon is a charitable organization that last year raised $1,201,216 for an amazing cause. However this charity has come at a price: the physical well being and sanity of the over 1,000 dancers who participate in the marathon. By raising $1,201,217 (just one dollar more than last year's amount), Sherman Ave hopes to free these dancers from the prison of their own creation, and finally end Dance Marathon, once and for all. With your donation, not only will you be giving money to a good cause, but you will be sending a clear message to Dance Marathon and their inhumane labor practices. Plus more importantly, you won't have to do Dance Marathon! And isn't that a reward in itself?

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>My name is Ben, and I first met Govinda in 2010 when he was the farm manager at the Sustainable Agriculture Development Program of Nepal. Govinda told me about his dream and asked if I could help him to establish his own NGO to contribute positively to the present and future of Nepal, and I gladly agreeed to do what I could. </li>
<li>This campaign is close to my heart. Over the years, Govinda and I have worked together - with the help of many other awesome people - to realise his dream. After 6 years of concerted effort, we have almost realised the full extent of Govinda's dream!</li>
<li>Your contribution will help Govinda realise his dream, by allowing him to build accomodation for his family,  farm workers, visiting farmers and school groups, and volunteers. It will ultimately allow Govinda to host Nepali farmers and school groups for training and education sessions and programs. Your contribution will in the long run, help make Nepal a more sustainable and equitable place for all who call it home.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<ul>
<li>To realise this goal, we need to raise $18,000. All of these funds will be spent on the construction of the buildings required to accomodate Govinda's family,  farm workers, visiting farmers and school groups, and volunteers. I can personally vouch for Govinda. His integrity, honesty, and what he refers to as his ""duty"" has and continues to inspire me. </li>
<li>As part of this campaign, we are offering a number of awesome perks! These perks will differ given the amount you donate and are all something to get excited about.</li>
<li>If we don't reach our entire goal, the funds will be utilized to construct the buildings of most importance. This would include a house for Govinda's family and farm workers, and a building for visiting farmers and school groups. In time, appropriate accommodation would be built for foreign volunteers who wish to  learn about organic, sustainable agriculture and Nepali culture.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>This project is incredibly valuable to Govinda and the world at large. With unsustainable agricultural practices, and global inequality at unprecedented levels - not to mention the very real link between the two - projects like this are becoming ever more valuable.</li>
<li>Mountain View Eco Farm has a proven track record with respect to organisation goals, and fundraising success and accountability. In 2013, we managed to raise $4000 to purchase farm animals and equipment, and so far, Govinda has demonstrated a great deal of entrepreneurship, tenacity and hard-work.</li>
<li>If you don't believe us, feel free to check out Mountain View Eco Farm's website or Facebook page. Even better, head over to Nepal and check it out for yourself.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li>We realize that fundraising can be challenging, and that funds can be hard to come by. We believe however, that we have the enthusiasm, the drive and the tenacity to ensure that our goal is reached.</li>
<li>Our plan is to promote this campaign as wide and far as possible, utilizing our extensive social networks in Nepal and internationally and through the promotion of our campaign through online articles and communities of people sympathetic to our cause.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<p>Hi. We're The Nerd’s Closet. We are a group of extremely motivated and talented high school seniors and programmers from Chicago, Illinois. We are trying to help make the internet a safer, more positive place by limiting the amount of harassment present online. Our next project is to create an online community that embodies our goals, while also being diverse and collaborative.  But we need your help.<br/></p>
<p>We need to raise $10,000 to cover the cost of launching the community or it cannot reach its fullest potential. So we're turning to our strongest supporters to ask for contributions. In exchange, we're offering TNC swag like t-shirts and headphones, Gift Cards, and even the chance to be part of our team! Your contribution will help us finalize and secure our community, and further, <b>it will help make the internet a much more fun, positive place</b>. Thanks!</p>

<p>The Nerd’s Closet is an online community that aims make the internet a safer, more positive place by limiting the amount of harassment present online. <b>We want to be a safe place where users can discuss, create and innovate together without the fear of having their opinions ridiculed. </b>Our aim is to create a <b>self-sufficient, full-fledged internet experience </b>that is removed from the negativity that the internet has become infamous for. But promoting a positive environment does not mean that our community will be boring or less functional than other communities. We will still have a blog, a forum, and even a custom social media network for you to enjoy. Other anti-harassment online communities tend to act as a support system to help people who have already been harassed online, which is wonderful, but <b>it doesn’t prevent the problem</b>. <i>The Nerd’s Closet</i> is different because it provides a harassment free space where you can do everything that you normally do on the web; shop, chat, play games, etc., that just happens to be harassment free.</p>

</div></div></div>","The Nerd's Closet is the more social Social Network for nerds, geeks, dystopia addicts, and sci-fi aficionados. Our aim is to create an inclusive environment for people who are tired of being trolled, harassed and pushed around to engage in civil discourse on topics ranging from Game of Thrones to Pokemon to Dungeons & Dragons. In short anyone with any interest or opinion is allowed to contribute as long as you are willing to learn, be respectful, and don't mind being called a nerd! That's why strongly discourage trolling, inappropriate or discriminatory language (PG-13), and online harassment. Those who violate our guidelines will be subject to cyber-banishment of the worst possible kind!




 

Hi. We're The Nerd’s Closet. We are a group of extremely motivated and talented high school seniors and programmers from Chicago, Illinois. We are trying to help make the internet a safer, more positive place by limiting the amount of harassment present online. Our next project is to create an online community that embodies our goals, while also being diverse and collaborative.  But we need your help.
We need to raise $10,000 to cover the cost of launching the community or it cannot reach its fullest potential. So we're turning to our strongest supporters to ask for contributions. In exchange, we're offering TNC swag like t-shirts and headphones, Gift Cards, and even the chance to be part of our team! Your contribution will help us finalize and secure our community, and further, it will help make the internet a much more fun, positive place. Thanks!
   



 
The Nerd’s Closet is an online community that aims make the internet a safer, more positive place by limiting the amount of harassment present online. We want to be a safe place where users can discuss, create and innovate together without the fear of having their opinions ridiculed. Our aim is to create a self-sufficient, full-fledged internet experience that is removed from the negativity that the internet has become infamous for. But promoting a positive environment does not mean that our community will be boring or less functional than other communities. We will still have a blog, a forum, and even a custom social media network for you to enjoy. Other anti-harassment online communities tend to act as a support system to help people who have already been harassed online, which is wonderful, but it doesn’t prevent the problem. The Nerd’s Closet is different because it provides a harassment free space where you can do everything that you normally do on the web; shop, chat, play games, etc., that just happens to be harassment free.






 


Our plan is to always put our users first; as such, it is our goal that a great majority of our content, style, and tone is created by our users. This ensures that everyone's voice is heard (provided they contribute, of course!) .


  

According to a Pew Research Center survey, 40% of people have been harassed online, and 73% of people have witnessed someone else being harassed . Among people between the ages of 18 and 29, this figure jumps up to 92%. For too long, many people have been suffering because they feel unsafe or unsupported. With The Nerd’s Closet, you’ll enter a place where you can feel safe and loved, a place where you can fearlessly speak your mind. The Nerd’s Closet is creating a different kind of internet, where diversity, equality, and tolerance are valued over negativity and bickering. We want to start an internet revolution. But we need your help to make it a reality.

This campaign is intended specifically to help vegans live--as in places to live, or places to stay--from short-term (such as couchsurfing, bed &amp; breakfasts, and vacation timeshares) to long term (finding vegan roommates,  renting a room in a vegan home, or creating vegan communities). </p>

<p>My name is Deborah Brister and I'm the Executive Director of the International Vegan Collaborative. We started the Vegan Housing Vegan Roommates campaign because we want to ensure that every person that becomes vegan has the support and resources available to stay vegan. This includes human resources like the people closest to us--those sharing the same home. For vegans, the people that stay with us, visit us, and live with us, can be difficult to be around if they do not support the vegan lifestyle. </p>

<br/>
<p>Our mission is simple: make it as easy as possible to connect vegans with vegans. Up to this point, we have been doing this through our database and social media. We have helped many vegans connect, nationally and internationally, however we have been doing it on a personalized basis to ensure privacy is maintained.  Extensive effort, on our part, is given to those serious about finding the right tenant, roommate, host or guest. We are a volunteer-based organization and due to the massive explosion of new vegans, we have outgrown this system and now need to become more efficient and automated. Therefore, this campaign is to provide funding for a new, customized program and mobile app that vegans can use to interact with each other much easier, quicker and safer than ever before. </p>
<p>With a dedicated website and mobile app, specifically designed for vegans, we hope to pinpoint more compatible vegan roommates, guests, hosts and landlords. In addition, we want to provide greater opportunities for those interested in living in vegan communities and group living spaces, even including vegan senior cooperative living. We want to improve the way vegans live--for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p><b>What
We Need </b></p>
<p>We are asking $3000 to

<p><i>Why is this different from other housing/roommate

<p>The central focus is on
connecting vegans. It’s not just a little checkbox on a generic broad

it’s for one day, a week, a year, or longer. The most important consideration
is sharing space with like-minded compassionate vegan housemates or roommates. </p>
<p>The app will do four things:</p>
<p>1)<span> 
</span>Connect vegans
with a <b>whole continuum of vegan living
situations</b> from short to long term (couch-surfing to B &amp; B’s to vacation
timeshares to renting).</p>
<p>2)<span> 
</span>Consider a whole <b>continuum of vegan lifestyles and attitudes</b>

opportunities to privately <b>organize and
build vegan groups</b> and develop larger cooperative living if desired.</p>
<p>4)<span> 
</span><b>Integrate vegan businesses and restaurants</b> into searches to support and strengthen vegan

<p>We want to get this app running as
an automated program and anticipate eventually charging a minimal monthly
or annual fee to use it (Note that all donors of this Indiegogo campaign will
receive a free lifetime pass to use this service). Anticipating growth in the

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Why should you help us</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Before you go further, here are the main reasons to help us :</p>
<p><u><strong>- Local social impact :</strong></u> Lanquin is a very poor farming area where most people struggle to make a living. By donating, you will directly help finance the creation of a sustainable farming project (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/impactcenterlanquin/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">tuqtuqilal</a>), including ""permaculture"" farming and a cacao cooperative initiative.</p>
<p>The revenues generated by our shop will be largely (more than 50%) reinvested into these projects.</p>
<p>The goal is to increase the quality of life of the local farmers and introduce their cacao to international fine cacao market, aiding the sustainable development of the local community, who largely subsist on no more than a dollar a day!</p>
<p><u><strong>- For the chocolate! :</strong></u> If you never plan to visit Lanquin, then you may feel that you don't care about all that... which is fair enough. But you could feel, perhaps, that tourists visiting the area, as well as the people living here permanently, should have access to great chocolate. We want to make that a reality. Everyone would be very grateful of your support, and that will hopefully make you feel very good!</p>
<p><strong><u>- For education :</u></strong> Our chocolate tour aims to teach people about chocolate and cacao in general, but more importantly, we teach how to make incredible ""bean to bar"" chocolate at home. The goal is for people to realize that chocolate is in fact very easy to make! So there should be no reason for anyone to go out and buy the overly processed 'chocolate' that is sold in supermarkets. The chocolate revolution needs you!</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Hey everyone.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">My name is Esteban, also referred to around here as the ""chocolate wizard""!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525553201/doyj8bzuccp7y2ap7p0n.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>For the last 4 years I have been living around the area of Semuc Champey, Guatemala, working extensively  with cacao. I have gained experience running a chocolate tour for Utopia Eco-Hotel for 3 years, and for the last year I have been working on a local cacao farm.</p>
<p>I am now working to create a small chocolate house in the village of Lanquin, were hundreds of tourists pass daily to visit the nearby park.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525553231/shrzh7bffvon9dksndsk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I am looking to provide excellent quality chocolate products for the tourists, but also for the local Maya population.</p>
<p>For the last 3 months, I have been creating an testing different products (blocks of chocolate, chocolate balls, granola bars, etc...) to evaluate the market potential. With just one volunteer going around for a few hours per day, it is easy to see that the potential is huge!</p>
<p>After all... people tend to love chocolate!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525553283/amj8rowztl4yexjjcr1j.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>(our chocolates displayed in a shop in town)</i></p>
<p>I already have the equipment for small batch chocolate making, stocks of products, knowledge of the town and its market potential, and contact with cacao farmers and tourist industry.</p>
<p>What I need help with mostly is the initial investment, which would cover: fridge, gas stove, furniture, etc... with your help, we can offer the village of Lanquin its new favorite shop:</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><i>THE LANQUIN CHOCOLATE HOUSE</i></h2>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The products :</h3>
<p>I have been making chocolates for years, and I have heard so many time that it was the best chocolate that people have ever had. I am therefor very confident in its success!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525553386/ako5lyej3so0hv6kauvi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our main products will be chocolate balls, which we already sell to both locals and tourist. We only do straight chocolate flavors for now but with a shop we could diversify.</p>
<p>Imagine chocolate infused with cardamom, vanilla, chili pepper, granola mix, peanut butter, honey... the possibilities are endless.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525553469/vwjp0zwqizc097gv4urm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">We will also sell blocks of chocolate, hot chocolate drinks, crepes (I'm French after all...), ice cream, and other delicious healthy homemade treats.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525553516/rzalacdjoubaeiludesz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Truly the candy-man shop!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The location :</h3>
<p>Because <strong>a successful shop is mostly a matter of great location</strong>, we are happy to announce we have managed to secure an incredible spot.</p>
<p>It is in the very center of the village, on the side of the street going to the national park, so <strong>EVERY </strong>tourist will pass by on their way to Semuc Champey. </p>
<p>Tourists visiting the village on foot will almost certainly stop at the shop (would you not visit a chocolate house?!) and tourists who drive past the shop on their way to the park will be left with a strong chocolaty impression in their minds. </p>
<p>The shop itself is split into two sections, consisting of a kitchen and crafting area in the back, and a section in the front to both showcase, and sell our products. At the front there is a large window so that we can sell directly on to the street.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Truly the perfect spot (and i personally know the owners)</strong></p>
<h3>The costs :</h3>
<p>We are located in a very rural part of Guatemala where life is still pretty cheap. The rent will be of Q1500 (200$) per month (including water and electricity). Taxes are 5% of the profit, and the salary for 1 employee is around Q2000 (250$) (which could increase with a commission based if things go well). So, at least at the beginning, <strong>we only need to sell around 400 bags of chocolate balls to pay for production costs and ALL the business costs.</strong></p>
<p>So far, <strong>a single volunteer, working casually for a few hours a day sells an average of 200 bags per month.</strong> So, with a permanent and more famous location, as well as a diversity of products, I<strong> have no doubt that this objective can be reached.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>But delicious treats are not the only thing we offer. One of the main purposes of the shop will be to advertise our chocolate workshop :</i></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>THE LANQUIN CHOCOLATE TOUR</strong></h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525553978/yq2jiuysvw5anlcjonn5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">This tour is running already (years of experience has shown it to be very popular) but lacks publicity and general awareness. <strong>A fixed location from which to advertise will greatly help to establish the tour as a permanent feature of Lanquins tourism industry.</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">It will also give us a place were we can sell tickets and answer direct questions from tourists. For now, we only receive bookings via the internet or local partners. The tour has enormous income potential, and the shop will also allow us to <strong>attract potential customers through allowing them to try the chocolate...</strong></p>

<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>THE CACAO COOPERATIVE</strong></h2>
<p>One of the biggest projects we are undertaking is to try to <strong>create a sustainable high quality market for the cacao of the area</strong>. For that, we are currently <strong>working with small cacao farmers and bigger farms to regroup them under a cooperative</strong> structure.</p>
<p> One of the main goals would be to start making high quality cacao beans by increasing the quality of the fermentation and drying processes.</p>
<p>As a shop we would benefit from the cooperative, as we would purchase cacao directly from them. Moreover, as tourists continue to buy our products, it could help <strong>put the cacao from Lanquin into the international fine cacao market. </strong>We are already in contact with many chocolatiers across the globe that are ready to give it a chance!</p>
<p><strong>Most importantly, it could represent an enormous increase in income for the local farmers, as well of pride in their work!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>You can visit our website to know more about it : <a href=""http://lanquinchocolate.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://lanquinchocolate.com</a></strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">What do We Need ?</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><i><strong>1) 3 months location for the shop : 500$</strong></i></u></h3>
<p>Once again, this is a fantastic location in the very center of the village (which can have THOUSANDS of local people on market days!) with excellent visibility and great inside potential. And we are already on good term with the owners.</p>
<p>3 months worth of upfront capital should be plenty to get everything started, and running smoothly.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i><u>2) 3 months salary for 1 employee : 800$</u></i></strong></h3>
<p>We want at least 1 local employee to work at the shop and help us there. Ideally we will need 2.</p>
<p>It is a great job opportunity around here, where the job market is extremely restricted. We will also use the help of volunteers (mostly to have English speaking people in the shop with more awareness of tourists desires and sales techniques).</p>
<p>The goal is to train the locals to become efficient caretakers of the shop, as well as productive sales representatives.</p>
<p>While the local minimum wage is around Q 1200, we intend to pay a base of Q 2000 and, with time, they will receive commission on sales, and potentially end up with a very good, steady salary. This kind of development would please us a lot!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i><u>3) Furniture and decoration : 900$</u></i></strong></h3>
<p>Whilst hard to evaluate, we have every intention of being frugal. We live in an area that produces a lot of wood for construction, so we can purchase material for cheap. A very good friend of mine is a wood-worker and he is looking for a place to showcase his work, so we will be able to work out a discounted price in exchange for his expertise. </p>
<p>We don't need very much to start. A few shelves and tables, a big paint job inside, a few plants, nice lamps and it would all be ready. We will continue to make it nicer as we move forward! </p>
<p>We also have a big window that opens on to the street, so even if the inside is not completely finished, we can already start selling.</p>
<p>Most important will be the outside decoration, because that's what will bring people in. For that, we will start by printing some big vinyl posters, and in the future we want to find a person to paint the entire facade with Mayan chocolate theme decoration.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong><i>4) CACAO! : 400$</i></strong></u></h3>
<p>Buying good cacao here is not as easy as it should be, and hopefully will be, soon!</p>
<p>It would be too long to explain it all here (you'll find more on that topic on our website) but <strong>we are currently working with a permaculture farming project to create a local cacao cooperative, in order to produce high quality cacao beans.</strong></p>
<p>In order <strong>to support that, we are ready to purchase our cacao at least double the normal local prices.</strong></p>
<p>With that much, we should easily last the 3 first months. and if not... it will mean that we sold a lot which is perfect. Then we'll just get more!</p>
<p>We also intend to sell cacao beans directly to customers from the shop.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i><u>5) Fridge and stove : 700$</u></i></strong></h3>
<p>Even if we could start without them they will make our life much easier and less stressful in term of supply and demand.</p>
<p><strong>Many of our products need to be refrigerated</strong> (crepe doe, jams, chocolates, etc...) to stay good for longer time period. We are in the middle of the jungle and it gets really hot and humid here.</p>
<p><strong>ALL of our products are very healthy, natural and homemade, and they don't have any preservatives</strong> in them, so refrigeration is crucial.</p>
<p>The gas stove will primarily be used to roast the cacao, and make crepes and bread. And, in the future, why not make several other cakes and delicious bakery goods (I'm allowed to dream of jungle croissants!).<br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Impact</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">This project could become very big, both for the people living in Lanquin, and for visitors:</p>
<p>- Obviously, it will <strong>give everyone a place to make their stomach happy</strong>, buy good chocolate, homemade natural products, healthy snacks, etc...</p>
<p>- <strong>Lanquin is mostly dependent on tourism so we intend to</strong> <strong>expand the ""chocolate reputation"" of the area,</strong> which is a big cacao producer. We intend for our chocolate tour to become a main attraction of the area, and something which draws in tourists from all over Guatemala!</p>
<p>- The creation of the cacao cooperative could end up <strong>bringing local cacao into the international market for fine chocolate</strong>. We are in touch with many bean to bar chocolate makers from around the world, and they are always interested in fine, sustainable cacao like ours. <strong>For the local farmers</strong>, <strong>it could mean a</strong> <strong>5-10 times increase of their usual income</strong>.</p>
<p>- It will also <strong>create new jobs</strong> in the area, and if it works very well then we could start a bigger chocolate factory project, that could potentially export chocolate around the globe!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Hard to say...</p>
<p>Once again, we have been conducting sale experiments over the last few months and so far it has been very well received.</p>
<p>Much of the local population, and most of the hostels in the area are now aware of our products, so it should not take long to start.</p>
<p><strong>The real danger would be if someone else did it before us!</strong></p>
<p>One of the challenges would actually be if we end up selling much more than anticipated, because we only have equipment for small scale business... but hey... if we make too much money and not not enough products, then we will happily buy better machines and hire more employees!</p>
</div><div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you have good painting skills, we will take a volunteer to help us with all the painting job.</p>
<p>We will also take volunteers to help us with the chocolate making and in the shop when it opens. You can check our workaway profile here : <a href=""https://www.workaway.info/972219347523-en.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WORKAWAY</a></p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Pourquoi nous aider ?</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Avant d'aller plus loin, en voici les raisons principales  :</p>
<p><u><strong>- Impact social :</strong></u></p>
<p>Lanquin est un village rural où la plupart des gens vivent avec moins de 1$ par jour. En soutenant notre projet, vous participerez directement à la création d'un projet d'agriculture durable (le projet ""Tuqtuq'ilal"") ainsi qu'à la mise en place d'une coopérative pour le cacao.</p>
<p>Les revenus générés par la boutique seront en grande partie (plus de 50%) réinvestis dans ces projets. Le but étant d'augmenter significativement le niveau de vie des fermiers locaux et d'introduire leur cacao sur le marché international aidant ainsi au développement des communitées locales.</p>
<p><u><strong>- Pour le chocolat! :</strong></u></p>
<p>Si vous n'avez pas l'intention de visiter Lanquin, vous vous dites peut-etre que tout cela ne vous concerne pas...! Mais peut-être pourriez-vous juste vous dire que les touristes de passage ainsi que les résidants permanents devraient pouvoir avoir accès à du chocolat de bonne qualité, ce qui n'est pas le cas actuellement. Nous voulons faire de cela une réalité.</p>
<p>Nous offrons également des cours de confection de chocolat maison, donc on se sait jamais... peut-être une de vos connaissances passera un jour par ici et reviendra vous voir avec son propre chocolat... et vous apprendra à son tour à faire le vôtre !</p>
<p>En tout cas, tout le monde vous remerciera de votre aide et notre espoir sera que vous y trouviez de la joie  :)</p>
<p><strong><u>- Pour la formation :</u></strong></p>
<p>Nous mettons l'accent sur deux aspects : la production et la consommation.</p>
<p>D'une part, nous allons travailler avec les fermiers locaux pour introduire de meilleures techniques de production de cacao afin d'en augmenter sa qualité et sa valeur.</p>
<p>D'autre part, nous voudrons apporter de nouvelles connaissances à nos visiteurs et leur faire prendre conscience qu'un chocolat de haute qualité peut se préparer dans n'importe quelle cuisine. Le 'Tour Chocolat' est destiné à leur apprendre la technique de fabrication à partir de fèves de cacao ainsi que l'histoire du chocolat.  <strong>Libérons-nous du joug de l'industrie du mauvais chocolat , dangereux pour notre santé !</strong></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">La révolution du chocolat a besoin de vous!</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong></h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Bonjour tout le monde.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Je m'appelle Esteban, aussi connu par ici comme le ""chocolate wizard""!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525553201/doyj8bzuccp7y2ap7p0n.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Je vis depuis 4 ans dans les environs de Semuc Champey, Guatemala. J'ai aquis mon expérience en faisant des ""tours chocolats"" à ""Utopia Eco Hostel"" pendant 3 ans et j'ai ensuite passé 1 an a travailler dans une ferme de cacao locale.</p>
<p>Je travaille maintenant à la création d'une petite chocolaterie dans le village de Lanquin où des centaines de touristes viennent quotidiennement visiter le parc national.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525553231/shrzh7bffvon9dksndsk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Je cherche à fournir du chocolat de haute qualité à la fois aux touristes et à la population locale maya.</p>
<p>Pendant les 3 derniers mois, j'ai créé et mis à l'essai toute une gamme de produits (blocs de chocolats, boules de chocolats, beurre de cacahuète, barres granolas, glaces, etc...) afin de tester le marché potentiel. Avec seulement un volontaire travaillant quelques heures par jour, le potentiel apparaît très large.</p>
<p>Après tout, les humains ont tendance à aimer le chocolat !</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525553283/amj8rowztl4yexjjcr1j.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>(Nos chocolats exposés dans une boutique de la ville)</i></p>
<p>Nous possédons déjà l'équipement nécessaire pour faire le chocolat, nous avons un stock de produits en réserve, nous connaissons bien la ville et ses habitants, son marché potentiel ainsi que les fermiers et l'activité touristique.</p>
<p>Nous avons besoin de votre aide principalement pour l'investissement initial, ce qui inclut : frigo, gazinière, fournitures, décoration, loyer et salaires. Avec votre aide, nous pourrions offrir à Lanquin sa nouvelle boutique favorite :</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>""THE LANQUIN CHOCOLATE HOUSE""</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Les produits :</strong></h3>
<p>Je fais du chocolat depuis des annees et j'ai entendu tellement souvent qu'il était parmis le meilleur chocolat que la plupart des gens ont pû goûter; de ce fait, je suis très confiant quant au succès de l'opération!</p>
</div>
<div>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525553386/ako5lyej3so0hv6kauvi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Notre produit principal sera la Boule de chocolat, que nous vendons déjà à la fois aux touristes et aux locaux. Pour le moment nous ne faisons ""que"" saveur chocolat mais avec une boutique nous pourrions nous permettre de  varier grandement notre gamme.</p>
<p>Imaginez des chocolats à la cardamome, vanille, piment, granola, beurre de cacahuète, miel, etc... les possibilités sont infinies et beaucoup de ces épices peuvent être produites localement.</p>
<p>Nous avons aussi l'intention de faire de la vente directe de fèves de cacao</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525553469/vwjp0zwqizc097gv4urm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">J'offrirais également des blocs de chocolats, des chocolats chauds, des crèpes (apres tout je suis francais!), des glaces et tout un tas de délicieuses choses faites maison.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525553516/rzalacdjoubaeiludesz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Bienvenue chez le ""candyman""</p>
<h3><strong>La location :</strong></h3>
<p>Parce que <strong>le succès d'une boutique est grandement lié à son emplacement</strong>, nous sommes heureux d'annoncer que nous avons sécurisé un des meilleurs spot de la ville.</p>
<p>La boutique sera extrêmement centrale, sur la rue principale. <strong>Tous les touristes passeront devant au moins 2 fois</strong> en allant visiter le parc national.</p>
<p>Ceux qui visiterons le village à pieds, s'arrêterons sûrement (après tout, il s'agit d'une chocolaterie, dur de résister n'est-ce pas?!) et ceux qui seront dans les camionettes en partance pour le parc ne pourrons que se rappeller de notre belle devanture et de son gros signe ""LANQUIN CHOCOLATE""...</p>
<p>Le local est séparé en deux et nous donne la possibilité d'aménager un espace cuisine et confection et un espace boutique et restaurant. Nous disposerons également d'une grande ouverture sur la rue ce qui facilitera grandement la vente.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>C'est vraiment l'emplacement parfait!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>Les coûts :</strong></h3>
<p>Nous sommes situés dans une région très rurale du Guatemala où le coût de la vie est très bas. La location du local sera de Q1500 par mois (170 euros) incluant eau et électricité. Les taxes sont de 5% du chiffre d'affaire et le salaire pour un employé est d'environ Q2000 (230 euros) mais qui pourrait augmenter significativement avec un systeme de comission par vente. Donc, au moins pour le départ, <strong>nous aurons juste besoin de vendre environs 400 sac de boules  en chocolat par mois pour couvrir tous nos frais</strong>.</p>
<p>Pour l'instant, <strong>un seul volontaire vend en moyenne 200 sacs par mois sans difficultés</strong>. Avec une boutique permanente et connue ainsi qu'une plus grande diversité de produits, <strong>je n'ai aucun doute que nous atteindrons largement cet objectif</strong>.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Mais nous ne visons pas qu'à remplir l'estomac de nos clients. L'un des principaux objectifs de la boutique sera d'assurer la promotion de notre ""classe de chocolat""</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">""THE LANQUIN CHOCOLATE TOUR""</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525553978/yq2jiuysvw5anlcjonn5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Le tour est déjà en fonctionnement (et des années d'expérience passées ont prouvé qu'il était très populaire) mais manque de visibilité. Avec un emplacement fixe pour en faire la promotion, nous espérons que notre tour deviendra une des attractions touristique clé de Lanquin.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">La boutique nous offrira la possibilité de faire goûter notre chocolat aux gens ce qui est la forme la plus efficace de promotion. Pour le moment, nous ne recevons des reservations que via internet ou certains hôtels partenaires. Correctement implanté, ce tour offre d'enormes perspectives financières et éducatives.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525554127/mesy45kcpppbwqicorki.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>La coopérative de cacao</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Un des plus gros projets auquel nous participons est la <strong>création d'un marché durable et de haute qualité pour le cacao local. Pour cela, nous travaillons à regrouper petits et grands fermiers en une coopérative.</strong></p>
<p>Un des objectifs principaux étant de réintroduire de bonnes techniques de fermentation et de séchage du cacao qui ont malheureusement été perdues au fil du temps, principalement à cause des prix ridiculement bas du marché local et du fait que le prix de vente ne change pas en fonction de la qualité du cacao...</p>
<p>En tant que chocolaterie, nous bénéficierons de la coopérative en nous y fournissant directement. Mais le but est de réussir à introduire le cacao de Lanquin sur les marchés internationaux et pour cela nous sommes déjà en contact avec de nombreux chocolatiers dans le monde prêts à lui donner sa chance!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Plus important, cela représentera une énorme augmentation du niveau de vie des fermiers locaux ansi que de la fierté de leur travail!</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>De quoi avons nous besoin ?</strong></h2>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>1) 3 mois de location pour la boutique : 500$ (420 euros)</strong></u></h3>
<p>Encore une fois, l'emplacement de ce local est parfaitement idéal autant en terme de visibilité que d'aménagement et nous sommes en bons termes avec les propriétaires.</p>
<p>Trois mois devraient suffire pour bien démarrer notre activité.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>2) 3 mois de salaire pour un employé : 800$ (700 euros)</strong></u></h3>
<p>Nous souhaitons au minimum un employé local pour nous aider à la boutique mais notre but est d'en embaucher deux.</p>
<p>Il s'agit d'une excéllente perspective d'emploi par ici oú le marché de l'emploi est extrêmement restreint. Nous ferons également appel a l'aide de volontaires notamment pour avoir des vendeurs parlant anglais et avec une meilleure compréhension des désirs des touristes ainsi que de techniques de vente.</p>
<p>Le but étant d'entraîner nos employés locaux à devenir de bons vendeurs et a apprendre une nouvelle langue. A terme, avec un système de commission sur les ventes, ils pourront sécuriser un très bon salaire dans des conditions de travail agréables. Et cela nous ferait très plaisir!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>3) Fournitures et décoration : 900$ (750 euros)</strong></u></h3>
<p>Il s'agit là d'un coût difficile à évaluer mais nous avons l'intention d'être tres économiques. Nous vivons dans une zone qui produit du bois de construction et nous pouvons donc l'obtenir à bas prix. Un très bon ami travaille le bois et cherche une facon d'exposer son travail donc nous allons pouvoir nous entraider sur ce point.</p>
<p>Nous n'avons pas besoin de beaucoup pour nous lancer : Quelques étagères, tables, peinture, quelques plantes, lampes et cela sera déjà très bien. Nous continuerons à rendre l'endroit plus agréable au fur et à mesure. Nous disposons d'une fenêtre pour vendre directement sur la rue ce qui nous permettra de démarrer la vente même si l'intérieur n'est pas complètement fini.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>4) CACAO! : 400$ (330 euros)</strong></u></h3>
<p>Il n'est pour l'instant pas si simple de trouver du bon cacao dans la région mais comme nous l'avons déjà expliqué, cela devrait changer assez rapidement avec l<strong>'introduction de techniques d'agriculture durable ainsi que la création d'une coopérative de cacao</strong>.</p>
<p>C'est un sujet assez complexe que nous expliquons plus clairement sur notre site internet.</p>
<p>Pour le moment <strong>nous payons déjà le double des prix locaux au fermiers qui produise du bon cacao.</strong></p>
<p>Ce montant nous permettrait de couvrir largement nos frais d'achat de cacao pendant au moins trois mois et sinon cela veut dire que nous vendons bien plus que prevu ce qui est parfait.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>5) Frigo et gazinière : 700$ (585 euros)</strong></u></h3>
<p><strong>Une bonne partie de nos produits nécessitent d'être refrigerés (pâte à crèpe, confitures, chocolats, etc...)</strong> afin de se conserver correctement. Nous vivons au milieu de la jungle et il peut faire très chaud et humide.</p>
<p><strong>Tous nos produits étant sains et fait maison, ils ne contiennent pas de conservateurs</strong>.</p>
<p>La gazinière quant à elle servira principalement à faire les crepes et à torréfier le cacao mais nous pourrons également ajouter du pain frais au menu et diffuser notre art national le plus célèbre et peut-être un jour... nos propres pains au chocolat (faire de la pâte feuilletee dans la jungle s'avère très compliqué... mais j'ai le droit de rêver!).</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>L'impact</strong></h2>
<p>Ce projet pourrait prendre beaucoup d'ampleur, à la fois pour les touristes et les locaux :</p>
<p>- Cela<strong> offrira à tout le monde un lieu pour satisfaire son palais</strong>, manger du bon chocolat, des produits naturels, sains et faits maisons, etc...</p>
<p>- <strong>Lanquin dépend largement du tourisme; notre projet pourrait augmenter sa réputation pour le chocolat.</strong> Après tout, il s'agit d'une zone fortement productrice de cacao. Nous espérons faire de notre tour une des attractions phare de la ville afin d'attirer plus de monde et inciter les visiteurs à rester plus longtemps.</p>
<p>- La création de la coopérative de cacao pourrait<strong> propulser le cacao local sur les marchés internationaux</strong> de cacao de haute qualité.  <strong>Pour les fermiers locaux, cela pourrait multiplier de 5 a 10 fois leurs revenus.</strong></p>
<p>- Nous allons aussi <strong>créer de nouveaux emplois</strong> et dans un futur un peu plus lointain on pourrait imaginer l'élargissement de la production de chocolat...</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Les risques</strong></h2>
<p>Difficile à dire...</p>
<p>Encore une fois, nous avons conduit des expériences de ventes durant les derniers mois et jusqu'à présent cela s'est plutôt bien passé.</p>
<p>Beaucoup de gens au village connaissent nos produits et demandent ou les acheter.</p>
<p><strong>Le vrai danger serait que quelqu'un d'autre ne le fasse avant nous!</strong></p>
<p> </p>

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Por qué deberías ayudarnos</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Antes de que vayan más lejos, aquí están las razones principales para que nos ayuden :</p>
<p><strong>- Impacto social local:</strong> Lanquin es un área agrícola muy pobre, dónde la mayoría de la gente lucha para ganarse la vida. Mediante la donación, usted va a ayudar directamente a financiar la creación de un proyecto de agricultura sostenible, incluyendo agricultura de “permacultura” y una iniciativa de cooperativa de cacao. Los ingresos generados por nuestra tienda serán en gran medida (más del 50%) reinvertidos en estos proyectos. El objetivo es aumentar la calidad de vida de los agricultores locales, e introducir su cacao en el mercado internacional de cacao fino, además del desarrollo sostenible de la comunidad local, de la cual la mayoría sobrevive con no más de $1 al día.</p>
<p><strong>- Por el chocolate:</strong> si nunca ha planeado visitar Lanquin, entonces debe sentir nada de esto le importa… lo que es bastante justo. Pero podrá sentir, a lo mejor, que tanto los turistas que visitan el área, como la gente que vive permanentemente aquí, debería tener un gran acceso al chocolate. Nosotros queremos hacer esto una realidad. Todo el mundo estaría muy agradecido por su apoyo, y eso ¡ojalá le haga sentir muy bien!</p>
<p><strong>- Para la educación:</strong> Nuestro tour de chocolate pretende educar a la gente sobre chocolate y cacao en general, pero más importante, nosotros enseñamos como hacer increíble chocolate del “grano a la barra” en casa. El objetivo es que la gente se dé cuenta que el chocolate es verdaderamente fácil de hacer. Entonces, no debería de haber ninguna razón para nadie de salir e ir a comprar el chocolate extremadamente procesado que se vende en los supermercados. ¡La revolución del chocolate le necesita!</p>

<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">Introducción</h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Hola a todos</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Mi nombre es Esteban, también conocido en los alrededores como “el mago del chocolate”</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525553201/doyj8bzuccp7y2ap7p0n.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>En los últimos 4 años he estado viviendo alrededor del área de Semuc Champey, Guatemala, trabajando extensamente con cacao. He ganado experiencia llevando un tour de chocolate para Utopía Eco-Hostal por 3 años, y en el último año he estado trabajando en una granja local de cacao.</p>
<p>Ahora estoy trabajando para crear una pequeña casa del chocolate en el pueblo de Lanquin, donde cientos de turistas pasan cada día para visitar el parque cercano.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525553231/shrzh7bffvon9dksndsk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Estoy buscando proporcionar productos de chocolate de excelente calidad para los turistas, pero también para la población Maya.</p>
<p>En los últimos 3 meses, he estado creando y probando diferentes productos (bloques de chocolate, bolas de chocolate, barras de granola, etc.) para evaluar el potencial del mercado. Con solo un voluntario dando vueltas por unas pocas horas al día, es fácil ver que ¡el potencial es enorme!</p>
<p>Después de todo…. ¡La gente tiende a amar el chocolate!</p>

<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>(nuestros chocolates en una tienda del pueblo)</i></p>
<p>Ya tengo casi todo lo que necesito –incluyendo el material para una pequeña partida de chocolate, productos en stock, conocimientos sobre el pueblo y el potencial de su mercado, y contacto con los productores de cacao y la industria del turismo.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">En lo que necesito ayuda, es más que nada en la inversión inicial; lo que cubriría una nevera, estufa de gas, mobiliario, etc. Con su ayuda le podemos ofrecer al pueblo de Lanquin su nueva tienda preferida:</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;"">LA CASA DE CHOCOLATE DE LANQUIN</h2>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3>Los productos :</h3>
<p>He estado haciendo chocolate durante años, y he oído muchas veces que era el mejor chocolate que la gente ha probado en su vida. Por lo tanto, me siento muy confiado en su  éxito.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525553386/ako5lyej3so0hv6kauvi.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Nuestros productos principales serán las bolas de chocolate, las cuales ya hemos vendido tanto para los locales como para los turistas. Solo hacemos sabores directamente de  chocolate por ahora, pero con la tienda se podría diversificar. Imagine chocolate infundido con cardamomo, vainilla, chiles, granola, manteca de maní, miel… las posibilidades son infinitas.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525553469/vwjp0zwqizc097gv4urm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">También venderemos bloques de chocolate, chocolate caliente, crepas (soy francés después de todo…), helado, y otras delicias sanas y hechas a mano.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525553516/rzalacdjoubaeiludesz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">¡Ciertamente la tienda del hombre de los dulces!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>La localización:</h3>
<p><strong>Debido a que el éxito de una tienda depende en gran medida de una fantástica ubicación</strong>, estamos felices de poder anunciarles que lo hemos manejado para asegurar un punto increíble.</p>
<p>Está en el centro del pueblo, en el lado de la calle dónde se va para el Parque Nacional, así pues, <strong>CADA turista va a pasar por delante</strong> en su camino hacia Semuc Champey.</p>
<p>Los turistas que visiten el pueblo a pie van seguramente a detenerse en la tienda (¿usted no visitaría una casa del chocolate?) y los turistas que manejan por delante de la tienda en su camino para el parque se llevarán una gran impresión de chocolate en sus mentes.</p>
<p>La tienda en si está dividida en dos secciones, consistiendo de una cocina y área de elaboración en la parte trasera, y una sección en el frente para mostrar y vender nuestros productos. En la parte delantera también una extensa ventana, por la cual podemos vender directamente a la calle.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Verdaderamente el lugar perfecto (y conozco a los dueños personalmente)</strong></p>
<h3>Los costes :</h3>
<p>Estamos localizados en un área realmente rural en Guatemala dónde la vida es aún bastante barata. La renta será de 1500 quetzales al mes (incluyendo agua y electricidad). Los impuestos son del 5% del beneficio, y el salario para un empleado es alrededor de 2000 quetzales  (el que se podría incrementar con una comisión basada si las cosas van bien). Así púes, al principio <strong>sólo necesitamos vender alrededor de 400 bolsas de bolas de chocolate para pagar los costes de producción y TODOS los costes del negocio.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Hasta ahora, un solo voluntario, trabajando casualmente por unas pocas horas al día vende una media de 200 bolsas al mes.</strong> Así pues, con una ubicación permanente y más conocida, además de una diversificación de productos, no tengo ninguna duda que este objetivo puede ser alcanzado.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><i>Pero los dulces deliciosos no son la única cosa que ofrecemos. Una de las razones principales de la tienda será anunciar nuestro taller de chocolate:</i></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">EL TOUR DE CHOCOLATE DE LANQUIN</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525553978/yq2jiuysvw5anlcjonn5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Este tour ya está en funcionamiento (años de experiencia han demostrado que es muy popular) pero falta publicidad y conocimiento general. Una ubicación fija des de la cual anunciarlo será de gran ayuda para establecer el tour como característica permanente de la industria de turismo en Lanquin.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">También nos dará un lugar donde vender las entradas (boletos) y poder responder directamente a preguntas de los turistas. Por ahora, solo recibimos reservas por internet o socios locales. El tour es un gran potencial de ingresos, y la tienda también nos proporcionará un potencial para atraer clientes a través de dejarles probar el chocolate….</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1525554127/mesy45kcpppbwqicorki.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>LA COOPERATIVA DEL CACAO</strong></h2>Uno de los proyectos más grandes que estamos llevando a cabo es intentar <strong>crear un mercado sostenible de alta calidad de cacao en el área.</strong> Para eso, ahora estamos <strong>trabajando con pequeños productores de cacao y grandes plantaciones para reagruparlos bajo una estructura de cooperativa.</strong><br/> <p>Uno de los objetivos principales sería empezar haciendo granos de cacao de alta calidad mediante el aumento de la calidad de la fermentación y el proceso de secado.</p>
<p>Como tienda nos beneficiaríamos de la cooperativa, ya que adquiriríamos el cacao directamente de ellos. Más allá, como los turistas continúen comprando nuestros productos, <strong>podría ayudar a poner el cacao de Lanquin dentro del mercado internacional de cacao fino</strong>. Ya estamos en contacto con muchos chocolateros de todo el mundo que están preparados para probar un poco.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Lo más importante, ¡podría representar un ingreso enorme para los agricultores locales, además de orgullo por su trabajo!</strong></p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>¿QUÉ NECESITAMOS?</strong></h2> <h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>1) 3 meses para la tienda: $500</strong></u></h3>
<p>Una vez más, es una localización fantástica en el mero centro del pueblo (que tiene millones de locales en los días de mercado) con una excelente visualización y un gran potential interior.</p>
<p>Un capital inicial de 3 meses debería ser más que suficiente para tener todo listo y llevarlo sin problemas.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>2) 3 meses de salario para un empleado: $800</strong></u></h3>
<p>Queremos por lo menos un empleado local para trabajar en la tienda y ayudarnos allí. Aunque lo ideal serían dos.</p>
<p>Es una oportunidad genial de trabajo aquí, dónde el mercado de trabajo es extremadamente reducido. También usaremos la ayuda de los voluntarios (más que nada para tener gente de habla inglesa en la tienda, y con más conocimiento sobre los deseos de los turistas y técnicas de venda).</p>
<p>El objetivo es formar a los locales para que sean cuidadores eficientes de la tienda, así como representantes productivos en vendas.</p>
<p>El salario minimo aqui es de Q 1200 pero nosotros quieremos pagar Q 2000 como mínimo y, con tiempo, posibilidad de cobrar comisiones. De esta manera podría acabar con un salario bueno y estable. ¡Este tipo de desarrollo nos complacería mucho!</p> <h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>3) Mobiliario y decoración: $900</strong></u></h3>
<p>Mientas que es difícil de evaluar, tenemos toda la intención de ser frugales. Vivimos en un área que produce mucha madera para la construcción así que podemos comprar el material barato. Un buen amigo mío es carpintero y él está buscando un lugar dónde exponer su trabajo, así podemos trabajar en un descuento en el precio a cambio de su experiencia.</p>
<p>No necesitamos mucho para empezar. Unas estanterías y mesas, un gran trabajo de pintura dentro, unas cuantas plantas, bonitas lámparas y estaría listo. Continuaremos haciéndolo más bonito cuando avancemos. También tenemos una gran ventana que se abre a la calle, así que aunque el interior no esté completamente acabado, podemos empezar vendiendo. Lo más importante será la decoración de afuera, porque eso será lo que incitará a la gente a entrar. Para eso, vamos a empezar imprimiendo algún gran póster de vinilo, y, en el futuro queremos encontrar a una persona que pinte toda la fachada con decoración sobre el chocolate maya como temática.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong><u>4) Cacao: $400</u></strong></h3>
<p>Comprar buen cacao aquí no es tan fácil como debería ser, y esperemos que temprano lo sea.</p> <p>Sería demasiado largo para explicarlo aquí (pueden encontrar más sobre este tema en nuestra web), pero actualmente <strong>estamos trabajando en un proyecto de cultivo de permacultura para crear una cooperativa de cacao local y así producir granos de cacao de alta calidad.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Para poder apoyar en esto, estamos listos para comprar nuestro cacao por lo menos por el doble del precio normal local.</strong></p>
<p>Con tanto, deberíamos  llegar fácilmente a los tres meses. Y si no… significaría que hemos vendido muchísimo, lo que es perfecto. Entonces, ¡solo tendríamos que ir a comprar más!</p>
<p>También intentaremos vender los granos de cacao directamente a los clientes des de la tienda.</p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><u><strong>5) Refrigeradora y estufa: $700</strong></u></h3>
<p>Aún y si pudiéramos empezar sin ellos, nos harían la vida mucho más fácil y menos estresada en término de suplementar y de demanda.</p>
<p><strong>Muchos de nuestros productos necesitan estar en la nevera</strong> (masa de crepas, chocolates,…) para estar bien por un periodo de tiempo largo. Estamos en mitad de la jungla y aquí hace mucho calor y humedad.</p>
<p><strong>Todos nuestros productos son muy saludables, naturales y hechos a mano, no tienen ningún tipo de conservante, así que la refrigeración es crucial.</strong> <strong>.</strong></p>
<p>La estufa de gas  sería principalmente usada para tostar el cacao, hacer crepas y hacer pan. Y en el futuro, por qué no, podríamos hacer muchos otros pasteles y demás deliciosos productos de panadería (¡se me está permitido soñar con croissants de jungla!).</p>
<p> </p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">El impacto :</h3>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Este proyecto podría ser muy grande, tanto para la gente que vive en Lanquin, como para los visitantes.</p>
<p>- Obviamente, <strong>daría a todo el mundo un lugar para hacer el estómago feliz</strong>, comprar buen chocolate, productos naturales hechos a mano, tentempiés sanos, etc…</p>
<p><strong>- Lanquin depende en su mayoría del turismo así que intentamos expandir la “reputación del chocolate” en el área</strong>, la cual es una gran productora  de cacao. Nuestra intención es que nuestro tour de chocolate se convierta en la atracción principal del área, y algo que atraiga a turistas de toda Guatemala.</p>
<p><strong>- La creación de la cooperativa de cacao podría acabar trayendo el cacao local al mercado internacional del cacao fino.</strong> Estamos en contacto con bastantes chocolateros de todo el mundo, y ellos siempre están interesados en el cacao fino y sostenible como lo es el nuestro. <strong>Para los productores locales podría significar un incremento de 5-10 veces más su ingreso usual.</strong></p>
<p>- También <strong>creará nuevos empleos en el área</strong>, y si funciona muy bien se podría empezar un proyecto mayor:  la fábrica de chocolate. Eso podría facilitar la ¡exportación de chocolate alrededor del globo!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Riesgos y Retos</strong></h2>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">Difícil de decir…</p>
<p>Una vez más, hemos estado realizando experimentos de ventas en los últimos tres meses y hasta ahora ha estado muy bien recibido.</p>
<p>Mucha de la población local, y la mayoría de hostales en el área, ahora conocen sobre nuestros productos, así que no debería de tomar mucho tiempo comenzar.</p>
<p><strong>¡El real peligro sería si alguien lo hiciera antes que nosotros!</strong></p>
<p>Uno de los retos podría realmente ser si acabamos vendiendo mucho más que lo anticipado, porque solo tenemos material para un negocio a pequeña escala… pero hey…. Si hacemos demasiado dinero y no suficientes productos, ¡entonces estaremos muy felices de comprar mejores máquinas y emplear a más trabajadores!</p> <h2 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Otras maneras en las que puede contactarnos</strong></h2> <p>Si tiene talento para pintar, le podemos tomar como voluntario para todo el trabajo de pintura.</p>
<p>También tomaremos voluntarios para ayudarnos con la elaboración de chocolate y para la tienda cuando esté abierta. Puede encontrar nuestro perfil de workaway aqui: <a href=""https://www.workaway.info/972219347523-en.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">WORKAWAY</a></p>

Why should you help us
Before you go further, here are the main reasons to help us :
- Local social impact : Lanquin is a very poor farming area where most people struggle to make a living. By donating, you will directly help finance the creation of a sustainable farming project (tuqtuqilal), including ""permaculture"" farming and a cacao cooperative initiative.
The revenues generated by our shop will be largely (more than 50%) reinvested into these projects.
The goal is to increase the quality of life of the local farmers and introduce their cacao to international fine cacao market, aiding the sustainable development of the local community, who largely subsist on no more than a dollar a day!
- For the chocolate! : If you never plan to visit Lanquin, then you may feel that you don't care about all that... which is fair enough. But you could feel, perhaps, that tourists visiting the area, as well as the people living here permanently, should have access to great chocolate. We want to make that a reality. Everyone would be very grateful of your support, and that will hopefully make you feel very good!
- For education : Our chocolate tour aims to teach people about chocolate and cacao in general, but more importantly, we teach how to make incredible ""bean to bar"" chocolate at home. The goal is for people to realize that chocolate is in fact very easy to make! So there should be no reason for anyone to go out and buy the overly processed 'chocolate' that is sold in supermarkets. The chocolate revolution needs you!
 
INTRODUCTION
Hey everyone.
My name is Esteban, also referred to around here as the ""chocolate wizard""!

For the last 4 years I have been living around the area of Semuc Champey, Guatemala, working extensively  with cacao. I have gained experience running a chocolate tour for Utopia Eco-Hotel for 3 years, and for the last year I have been working on a local cacao farm.
I am now working to create a small chocolate house in the village of Lanquin, were hundreds of tourists pass daily to visit the nearby park.

I am looking to provide excellent quality chocolate products for the tourists, but also for the local Maya population.
For the last 3 months, I have been creating an testing different products (blocks of chocolate, chocolate balls, granola bars, etc...) to evaluate the market potential. With just one volunteer going around for a few hours per day, it is easy to see that the potential is huge!
After all... people tend to love chocolate!

(our chocolates displayed in a shop in town)
I already have the equipment for small batch chocolate making, stocks of products, knowledge of the town and its market potential, and contact with cacao farmers and tourist industry.
What I need help with mostly is the initial investment, which would cover: fridge, gas stove, furniture, etc... with your help, we can offer the village of Lanquin its new favorite shop:
THE LANQUIN CHOCOLATE HOUSE
 

The products :
I have been making chocolates for years, and I have heard so many time that it was the best chocolate that people have ever had. I am therefor very confident in its success!

Our main products will be chocolate balls, which we already sell to both locals and tourist. We only do straight chocolate flavors for now but with a shop we could diversify.
Imagine chocolate infused with cardamom, vanilla, chili pepper, granola mix, peanut butter, honey... the possibilities are endless.

 
We will also sell blocks of chocolate, hot chocolate drinks, crepes (I'm French after all...), ice cream, and other delicious healthy homemade treats.
 

Truly the candy-man shop!
 
The location :
Because a successful shop is mostly a matter of great location, we are happy to announce we have managed to secure an incredible spot.
It is in the very center of the village, on the side of the street going to the national park, so EVERY tourist will pass by on their way to Semuc Champey. 
Tourists visiting the village on foot will almost certainly stop at the shop (would you not visit a chocolate house?!) and tourists who drive past the shop on their way to the park will be left with a strong chocolaty impression in their minds. 
The shop itself is split into two sections, consisting of a kitchen and crafting area in the back, and a section in the front to both showcase, and sell our products. At the front there is a large window so that we can sell directly on to the street.
Truly the perfect spot (and i personally know the owners)
The costs :
We are located in a very rural part of Guatemala where life is still pretty cheap. The rent will be of Q1500 (200$) per month (including water and electricity). Taxes are 5% of the profit, and the salary for 1 employee is around Q2000 (250$) (which could increase with a commission based if things go well). So, at least at the beginning, we only need to sell around 400 bags of chocolate balls to pay for production costs and ALL the business costs.
So far, a single volunteer, working casually for a few hours a day sells an average of 200 bags per month. So, with a permanent and more famous location, as well as a diversity of products, I have no doubt that this objective can be reached.
But delicious treats are not the only thing we offer. One of the main purposes of the shop will be to advertise our chocolate workshop :
THE LANQUIN CHOCOLATE TOUR

This tour is running already (years of experience has shown it to be very popular) but lacks publicity and general awareness. A fixed location from which to advertise will greatly help to establish the tour as a permanent feature of Lanquins tourism industry.
It will also give us a place were we can sell tickets and answer direct questions from tourists. For now, we only receive bookings via the internet or local partners. The tour has enormous income potential, and the shop will also allow us to attract potential customers through allowing them to try the chocolate...

 
THE CACAO COOPERATIVE
One of the biggest projects we are undertaking is to try to create a sustainable high quality market for the cacao of the area. For that, we are currently working with small cacao farmers and bigger farms to regroup them under a cooperative structure.
 One of the main goals would be to start making high quality cacao beans by increasing the quality of the fermentation and drying processes.
As a shop we would benefit from the cooperative, as we would purchase cacao directly from them. Moreover, as tourists continue to buy our products, it could help put the cacao from Lanquin into the international fine cacao market. We are already in contact with many chocolatiers across the globe that are ready to give it a chance!
Most importantly, it could represent an enormous increase in income for the local farmers, as well of pride in their work!
 
You can visit our website to know more about it : http://lanquinchocolate.com
 
What do We Need ?
 
1) 3 months location for the shop : 500$
Once again, this is a fantastic location in the very center of the village (which can have THOUSANDS of local people on market days!) with excellent visibility and great inside potential. And we are already on good term with the owners.
3 months worth of upfront capital should be plenty to get everything started, and running smoothly.
 
2) 3 months salary for 1 employee : 800$
We want at least 1 local employee to work at the shop and help us there. Ideally we will need 2.
It is a great job opportunity around here, where the job market is extremely restricted. We will also use the help of volunteers (mostly to have English speaking people in the shop with more awareness of tourists desires and sales techniques).
The goal is to train the locals to become efficient caretakers of the shop, as well as productive sales representatives.
While the local minimum wage is around Q 1200, we intend to pay a base of Q 2000 and, with time, they will receive commission on sales, and potentially end up with a very good, steady salary. This kind of development would please us a lot!
 
3) Furniture and decoration : 900$
Whilst hard to evaluate, we have every intention of being frugal. We live in an area that produces a lot of wood for construction, so we can purchase material for cheap. A very good friend of mine is a wood-worker and he is looking for a place to showcase his work, so we will be able to work out a discounted price in exchange for his expertise. 
We don't need very much to start. A few shelves and tables, a big paint job inside, a few plants, nice lamps and it would all be ready. We will continue to make it nicer as we move forward! 
We also have a big window that opens on to the street, so even if the inside is not completely finished, we can already start selling.
Most important will be the outside decoration, because that's what will bring people in. For that, we will start by printing some big vinyl posters, and in the future we want to find a person to paint the entire facade with Mayan chocolate theme decoration.
 
4) CACAO! : 400$
Buying good cacao here is not as easy as it should be, and hopefully will be, soon!
It would be too long to explain it all here (you'll find more on that topic on our website) but we are currently working with a permaculture farming project to create a local cacao cooperative, in order to produce high quality cacao beans.
In order to support that, we are ready to purchase our cacao at least double the normal local prices.
With that much, we should easily last the 3 first months. and if not... it will mean that we sold a lot which is perfect. Then we'll just get more!
We also intend to sell cacao beans directly to customers from the shop.
 
5) Fridge and stove : 700$
Even if we could start without them they will make our life much easier and less stressful in term of supply and demand.
Many of our products need to be refrigerated (crepe doe, jams, chocolates, etc...) to stay good for longer time period. We are in the middle of the jungle and it gets really hot and humid here.
ALL of our products are very healthy, natural and homemade, and they don't have any preservatives in them, so refrigeration is crucial.
The gas stove will primarily be used to roast the cacao, and make crepes and bread. And, in the future, why not make several other cakes and delicious bakery goods (I'm allowed to dream of jungle croissants!). 

The Impact
This project could become very big, both for the people living in Lanquin, and for visitors:
- Obviously, it will give everyone a place to make their stomach happy, buy good chocolate, homemade natural products, healthy snacks, etc...
- Lanquin is mostly dependent on tourism so we intend to expand the ""chocolate reputation"" of the area, which is a big cacao producer. We intend for our chocolate tour to become a main attraction of the area, and something which draws in tourists from all over Guatemala!
- The creation of the cacao cooperative could end up bringing local cacao into the international market for fine chocolate. We are in touch with many bean to bar chocolate makers from around the world, and they are always interested in fine, sustainable cacao like ours. For the local farmers, it could mean a 5-10 times increase of their usual income.
- It will also create new jobs in the area, and if it works very well then we could start a bigger chocolate factory project, that could potentially export chocolate around the globe!
 

Risks & Challenges
Hard to say...
Once again, we have been conducting sale experiments over the last few months and so far it has been very well received.
Much of the local population, and most of the hostels in the area are now aware of our products, so it should not take long to start.
The real danger would be if someone else did it before us!
One of the challenges would actually be if we end up selling much more than anticipated, because we only have equipment for small scale business... but hey... if we make too much money and not not enough products, then we will happily buy better machines and hire more employees!

Other Ways You Can Help
If you have good painting skills, we will take a volunteer to help us with all the painting job.
We will also take volunteers to help us with the chocolate making and in the shop when it opens. You can check our workaway profile here : WORKAWAY
If you can and want to help in any other way, feel free to contact us and we can see what we can do.

Pourquoi nous aider ?
Avant d'aller plus loin, en voici les raisons principales  :
- Impact social :
Lanquin est un village rural où la plupart des gens vivent avec moins de 1$ par jour. En soutenant notre projet, vous participerez directement à la création d'un projet d'agriculture durable (le projet ""Tuqtuq'ilal"") ainsi qu'à la mise en place d'une coopérative pour le cacao.
Les revenus générés par la boutique seront en grande partie (plus de 50%) réinvestis dans ces projets. Le but étant d'augmenter significativement le niveau de vie des fermiers locaux et d'introduire leur cacao sur le marché international aidant ainsi au développement des communitées locales.
- Pour le chocolat! :
Si vous n'avez pas l'intention de visiter Lanquin, vous vous dites peut-etre que tout cela ne vous concerne pas...! Mais peut-être pourriez-vous juste vous dire que les touristes de passage ainsi que les résidants permanents devraient pouvoir avoir accès à du chocolat de bonne qualité, ce qui n'est pas le cas actuellement. Nous voulons faire de cela une réalité.
Nous offrons également des cours de confection de chocolat maison, donc on se sait jamais... peut-être une de vos connaissances passera un jour par ici et reviendra vous voir avec son propre chocolat... et vous apprendra à son tour à faire le vôtre !
En tout cas, tout le monde vous remerciera de votre aide et notre espoir sera que vous y trouviez de la joie  :)
- Pour la formation :
Nous mettons l'accent sur deux aspects : la production et la consommation.
D'une part, nous allons travailler avec les fermiers locaux pour introduire de meilleures techniques de production de cacao afin d'en augmenter sa qualité et sa valeur.
D'autre part, nous voudrons apporter de nouvelles connaissances à nos visiteurs et leur faire prendre conscience qu'un chocolat de haute qualité peut se préparer dans n'importe quelle cuisine. Le 'Tour Chocolat' est destiné à leur apprendre la technique de fabrication à partir de fèves de cacao ainsi que l'histoire du chocolat.  Libérons-nous du joug de l'industrie du mauvais chocolat , dangereux pour notre santé !
La révolution du chocolat a besoin de vous!
 
Pour en savoir plus, je vous invite à visiter notre site (anglais et espagnol) : http://lanquinchocolate.com
 
INTRODUCTION
Bonjour tout le monde.
Je m'appelle Esteban, aussi connu par ici comme le ""chocolate wizard""!
 

Je vis depuis 4 ans dans les environs de Semuc Champey, Guatemala. J'ai aquis mon expérience en faisant des ""tours chocolats"" à ""Utopia Eco Hostel"" pendant 3 ans et j'ai ensuite passé 1 an a travailler dans une ferme de cacao locale.
Je travaille maintenant à la création d'une petite chocolaterie dans le village de Lanquin où des centaines de touristes viennent quotidiennement visiter le parc national.

Je cherche à fournir du chocolat de haute qualité à la fois aux touristes et à la population locale maya.
Pendant les 3 derniers mois, j'ai créé et mis à l'essai toute une gamme de produits (blocs de chocolats, boules de chocolats, beurre de cacahuète, barres granolas, glaces, etc...) afin de tester le marché potentiel. Avec seulement un volontaire travaillant quelques heures par jour, le potentiel apparaît très large.
Après tout, les humains ont tendance à aimer le chocolat !

(Nos chocolats exposés dans une boutique de la ville)
Nous possédons déjà l'équipement nécessaire pour faire le chocolat, nous avons un stock de produits en réserve, nous connaissons bien la ville et ses habitants, son marché potentiel ainsi que les fermiers et l'activité touristique.
Nous avons besoin de votre aide principalement pour l'investissement initial, ce qui inclut : frigo, gazinière, fournitures, décoration, loyer et salaires. Avec votre aide, nous pourrions offrir à Lanquin sa nouvelle boutique favorite :
""THE LANQUIN CHOCOLATE HOUSE""
 
Les produits :
Je fais du chocolat depuis des annees et j'ai entendu tellement souvent qu'il était parmis le meilleur chocolat que la plupart des gens ont pû goûter; de ce fait, je suis très confiant quant au succès de l'opération!



Notre produit principal sera la Boule de chocolat, que nous vendons déjà à la fois aux touristes et aux locaux. Pour le moment nous ne faisons ""que"" saveur chocolat mais avec une boutique nous pourrions nous permettre de  varier grandement notre gamme.
Imaginez des chocolats à la cardamome, vanille, piment, granola, beurre de cacahuète, miel, etc... les possibilités sont infinies et beaucoup de ces épices peuvent être produites localement.
Nous avons aussi l'intention de faire de la vente directe de fèves de cacao

 
J'offrirais également des blocs de chocolats, des chocolats chauds, des crèpes (apres tout je suis francais!), des glaces et tout un tas de délicieuses choses faites maison.
 

Bienvenue chez le ""candyman""
La location :
Parce que le succès d'une boutique est grandement lié à son emplacement, nous sommes heureux d'annoncer que nous avons sécurisé un des meilleurs spot de la ville.
La boutique sera extrêmement centrale, sur la rue principale. Tous les touristes passeront devant au moins 2 fois en allant visiter le parc national.
Ceux qui visiterons le village à pieds, s'arrêterons sûrement (après tout, il s'agit d'une chocolaterie, dur de résister n'est-ce pas?!) et ceux qui seront dans les camionettes en partance pour le parc ne pourrons que se rappeller de notre belle devanture et de son gros signe ""LANQUIN CHOCOLATE""...
Le local est séparé en deux et nous donne la possibilité d'aménager un espace cuisine et confection et un espace boutique et restaurant. Nous disposerons également d'une grande ouverture sur la rue ce qui facilitera grandement la vente.
C'est vraiment l'emplacement parfait!
 
Les coûts :
Nous sommes situés dans une région très rurale du Guatemala où le coût de la vie est très bas. La location du local sera de Q1500 par mois (170 euros) incluant eau et électricité. Les taxes sont de 5% du chiffre d'affaire et le salaire pour un employé est d'environ Q2000 (230 euros) mais qui pourrait augmenter significativement avec un systeme de comission par vente. Donc, au moins pour le départ, nous aurons juste besoin de vendre environs 400 sac de boules  en chocolat par mois pour couvrir tous nos frais.
Pour l'instant, un seul volontaire vend en moyenne 200 sacs par mois sans difficultés. Avec une boutique permanente et connue ainsi qu'une plus grande diversité de produits, je n'ai aucun doute que nous atteindrons largement cet objectif.
Mais nous ne visons pas qu'à remplir l'estomac de nos clients. L'un des principaux objectifs de la boutique sera d'assurer la promotion de notre ""classe de chocolat""
 
""THE LANQUIN CHOCOLATE TOUR""

Le tour est déjà en fonctionnement (et des années d'expérience passées ont prouvé qu'il était très populaire) mais manque de visibilité. Avec un emplacement fixe pour en faire la promotion, nous espérons que notre tour deviendra une des attractions touristique clé de Lanquin.
La boutique nous offrira la possibilité de faire goûter notre chocolat aux gens ce qui est la forme la plus efficace de promotion. Pour le moment, nous ne recevons des reservations que via internet ou certains hôtels partenaires. Correctement implanté, ce tour offre d'enormes perspectives financières et éducatives.

 
La coopérative de cacao
 
Un des plus gros projets auquel nous participons est la création d'un marché durable et de haute qualité pour le cacao local. Pour cela, nous travaillons à regrouper petits et grands fermiers en une coopérative.
Un des objectifs principaux étant de réintroduire de bonnes techniques de fermentation et de séchage du cacao qui ont malheureusement été perdues au fil du temps, principalement à cause des prix ridiculement bas du marché local et du fait que le prix de vente ne change pas en fonction de la qualité du cacao...
En tant que chocolaterie, nous bénéficierons de la coopérative en nous y fournissant directement. Mais le but est de réussir à introduire le cacao de Lanquin sur les marchés internationaux et pour cela nous sommes déjà en contact avec de nombreux chocolatiers dans le monde prêts à lui donner sa chance!
Plus important, cela représentera une énorme augmentation du niveau de vie des fermiers locaux ansi que de la fierté de leur travail!
 
De quoi avons nous besoin ?
 
1) 3 mois de location pour la boutique : 500$ (420 euros)
Encore une fois, l'emplacement de ce local est parfaitement idéal autant en terme de visibilité que d'aménagement et nous sommes en bons termes avec les propriétaires.
Trois mois devraient suffire pour bien démarrer notre activité.
 
2) 3 mois de salaire pour un employé : 800$ (700 euros)
Nous souhaitons au minimum un employé local pour nous aider à la boutique mais notre but est d'en embaucher deux.
Il s'agit d'une excéllente perspective d'emploi par ici oú le marché de l'emploi est extrêmement restreint. Nous ferons également appel a l'aide de volontaires notamment pour avoir des vendeurs parlant anglais et avec une meilleure compréhension des désirs des touristes ainsi que de techniques de vente.
Le but étant d'entraîner nos employés locaux à devenir de bons vendeurs et a apprendre une nouvelle langue. A terme, avec un système de commission sur les ventes, ils pourront sécuriser un très bon salaire dans des conditions de travail agréables. Et cela nous ferait très plaisir!
 
3) Fournitures et décoration : 900$ (750 euros)
Il s'agit là d'un coût difficile à évaluer mais nous avons l'intention d'être tres économiques. Nous vivons dans une zone qui produit du bois de construction et nous pouvons donc l'obtenir à bas prix. Un très bon ami travaille le bois et cherche une facon d'exposer son travail donc nous allons pouvoir nous entraider sur ce point.
Nous n'avons pas besoin de beaucoup pour nous lancer : Quelques étagères, tables, peinture, quelques plantes, lampes et cela sera déjà très bien. Nous continuerons à rendre l'endroit plus agréable au fur et à mesure. Nous disposons d'une fenêtre pour vendre directement sur la rue ce qui nous permettra de démarrer la vente même si l'intérieur n'est pas complètement fini.
 
4) CACAO! : 400$ (330 euros)
Il n'est pour l'instant pas si simple de trouver du bon cacao dans la région mais comme nous l'avons déjà expliqué, cela devrait changer assez rapidement avec l'introduction de techniques d'agriculture durable ainsi que la création d'une coopérative de cacao.
C'est un sujet assez complexe que nous expliquons plus clairement sur notre site internet.
Pour le moment nous payons déjà le double des prix locaux au fermiers qui produise du bon cacao.
Ce montant nous permettrait de couvrir largement nos frais d'achat de cacao pendant au moins trois mois et sinon cela veut dire que nous vendons bien plus que prevu ce qui est parfait.
 
5) Frigo et gazinière : 700$ (585 euros)
Une bonne partie de nos produits nécessitent d'être refrigerés (pâte à crèpe, confitures, chocolats, etc...) afin de se conserver correctement. Nous vivons au milieu de la jungle et il peut faire très chaud et humide.
Tous nos produits étant sains et fait maison, ils ne contiennent pas de conservateurs.
La gazinière quant à elle servira principalement à faire les crepes et à torréfier le cacao mais nous pourrons également ajouter du pain frais au menu et diffuser notre art national le plus célèbre et peut-être un jour... nos propres pains au chocolat (faire de la pâte feuilletee dans la jungle s'avère très compliqué... mais j'ai le droit de rêver!).
 
L'impact
Ce projet pourrait prendre beaucoup d'ampleur, à la fois pour les touristes et les locaux :
- Cela offrira à tout le monde un lieu pour satisfaire son palais, manger du bon chocolat, des produits naturels, sains et faits maisons, etc...
- Lanquin dépend largement du tourisme; notre projet pourrait augmenter sa réputation pour le chocolat. Après tout, il s'agit d'une zone fortement productrice de cacao. Nous espérons faire de notre tour une des attractions phare de la ville afin d'attirer plus de monde et inciter les visiteurs à rester plus longtemps.
- La création de la coopérative de cacao pourrait propulser le cacao local sur les marchés internationaux de cacao de haute qualité.  Pour les fermiers locaux, cela pourrait multiplier de 5 a 10 fois leurs revenus.
- Nous allons aussi créer de nouveaux emplois et dans un futur un peu plus lointain on pourrait imaginer l'élargissement de la production de chocolat...
 
Les risques
Difficile à dire...
Encore une fois, nous avons conduit des expériences de ventes durant les derniers mois et jusqu'à présent cela s'est plutôt bien passé.
Beaucoup de gens au village connaissent nos produits et demandent ou les acheter.
Le vrai danger serait que quelqu'un d'autre ne le fasse avant nous!

Por qué deberías ayudarnos
Antes de que vayan más lejos, aquí están las razones principales para que nos ayuden :
- Impacto social local: Lanquin es un área agrícola muy pobre, dónde la mayoría de la gente lucha para ganarse la vida. Mediante la donación, usted va a ayudar directamente a financiar la creación de un proyecto de agricultura sostenible, incluyendo agricultura de “permacultura” y una iniciativa de cooperativa de cacao. Los ingresos generados por nuestra tienda serán en gran medida (más del 50%) reinvertidos en estos proyectos. El objetivo es aumentar la calidad de vida de los agricultores locales, e introducir su cacao en el mercado internacional de cacao fino, además del desarrollo sostenible de la comunidad local, de la cual la mayoría sobrevive con no más de $1 al día.
- Por el chocolate: si nunca ha planeado visitar Lanquin, entonces debe sentir nada de esto le importa… lo que es bastante justo. Pero podrá sentir, a lo mejor, que tanto los turistas que visitan el área, como la gente que vive permanentemente aquí, debería tener un gran acceso al chocolate. Nosotros queremos hacer esto una realidad. Todo el mundo estaría muy agradecido por su apoyo, y eso ¡ojalá le haga sentir muy bien!
- Para la educación: Nuestro tour de chocolate pretende educar a la gente sobre chocolate y cacao en general, pero más importante, nosotros enseñamos como hacer increíble chocolate del “grano a la barra” en casa. El objetivo es que la gente se dé cuenta que el chocolate es verdaderamente fácil de hacer. Entonces, no debería de haber ninguna razón para nadie de salir e ir a comprar el chocolate extremadamente procesado que se vende en los supermercados. ¡La revolución del chocolate le necesita!

Introducción
Hola a todos
Mi nombre es Esteban, también conocido en los alrededores como “el mago del chocolate”

En los últimos 4 años he estado viviendo alrededor del área de Semuc Champey, Guatemala, trabajando extensamente con cacao. He ganado experiencia llevando un tour de chocolate para Utopía Eco-Hostal por 3 años, y en el último año he estado trabajando en una granja local de cacao.
Ahora estoy trabajando para crear una pequeña casa del chocolate en el pueblo de Lanquin, donde cientos de turistas pasan cada día para visitar el parque cercano.

Estoy buscando proporcionar productos de chocolate de excelente calidad para los turistas, pero también para la población Maya.
En los últimos 3 meses, he estado creando y probando diferentes productos (bloques de chocolate, bolas de chocolate, barras de granola, etc.) para evaluar el potencial del mercado. Con solo un voluntario dando vueltas por unas pocas horas al día, es fácil ver que ¡el potencial es enorme!
Después de todo…. ¡La gente tiende a amar el chocolate!

(nuestros chocolates en una tienda del pueblo)
Ya tengo casi todo lo que necesito –incluyendo el material para una pequeña partida de chocolate, productos en stock, conocimientos sobre el pueblo y el potencial de su mercado, y contacto con los productores de cacao y la industria del turismo.
En lo que necesito ayuda, es más que nada en la inversión inicial; lo que cubriría una nevera, estufa de gas, mobiliario, etc. Con su ayuda le podemos ofrecer al pueblo de Lanquin su nueva tienda preferida:
LA CASA DE CHOCOLATE DE LANQUIN
 


Los productos :
He estado haciendo chocolate durante años, y he oído muchas veces que era el mejor chocolate que la gente ha probado en su vida. Por lo tanto, me siento muy confiado en su  éxito.

Nuestros productos principales serán las bolas de chocolate, las cuales ya hemos vendido tanto para los locales como para los turistas. Solo hacemos sabores directamente de  chocolate por ahora, pero con la tienda se podría diversificar. Imagine chocolate infundido con cardamomo, vainilla, chiles, granola, manteca de maní, miel… las posibilidades son infinitas.

 
También venderemos bloques de chocolate, chocolate caliente, crepas (soy francés después de todo…), helado, y otras delicias sanas y hechas a mano.
 

¡Ciertamente la tienda del hombre de los dulces!
 
La localización:
Debido a que el éxito de una tienda depende en gran medida de una fantástica ubicación, estamos felices de poder anunciarles que lo hemos manejado para asegurar un punto increíble.
Está en el centro del pueblo, en el lado de la calle dónde se va para el Parque Nacional, así pues, CADA turista va a pasar por delante en su camino hacia Semuc Champey.
Los turistas que visiten el pueblo a pie van seguramente a detenerse en la tienda (¿usted no visitaría una casa del chocolate?) y los turistas que manejan por delante de la tienda en su camino para el parque se llevarán una gran impresión de chocolate en sus mentes.
La tienda en si está dividida en dos secciones, consistiendo de una cocina y área de elaboración en la parte trasera, y una sección en el frente para mostrar y vender nuestros productos. En la parte delantera también una extensa ventana, por la cual podemos vender directamente a la calle.
Verdaderamente el lugar perfecto (y conozco a los dueños personalmente)
Los costes :
Estamos localizados en un área realmente rural en Guatemala dónde la vida es aún bastante barata. La renta será de 1500 quetzales al mes (incluyendo agua y electricidad). Los impuestos son del 5% del beneficio, y el salario para un empleado es alrededor de 2000 quetzales  (el que se podría incrementar con una comisión basada si las cosas van bien). Así púes, al principio sólo necesitamos vender alrededor de 400 bolsas de bolas de chocolate para pagar los costes de producción y TODOS los costes del negocio.
Hasta ahora, un solo voluntario, trabajando casualmente por unas pocas horas al día vende una media de 200 bolsas al mes. Así pues, con una ubicación permanente y más conocida, además de una diversificación de productos, no tengo ninguna duda que este objetivo puede ser alcanzado.
Pero los dulces deliciosos no son la única cosa que ofrecemos. Una de las razones principales de la tienda será anunciar nuestro taller de chocolate:
EL TOUR DE CHOCOLATE DE LANQUIN

Este tour ya está en funcionamiento (años de experiencia han demostrado que es muy popular) pero falta publicidad y conocimiento general. Una ubicación fija des de la cual anunciarlo será de gran ayuda para establecer el tour como característica permanente de la industria de turismo en Lanquin.
También nos dará un lugar donde vender las entradas (boletos) y poder responder directamente a preguntas de los turistas. Por ahora, solo recibimos reservas por internet o socios locales. El tour es un gran potencial de ingresos, y la tienda también nos proporcionará un potencial para atraer clientes a través de dejarles probar el chocolate….

 
LA COOPERATIVA DEL CACAOUno de los proyectos más grandes que estamos llevando a cabo es intentar crear un mercado sostenible de alta calidad de cacao en el área. Para eso, ahora estamos trabajando con pequeños productores de cacao y grandes plantaciones para reagruparlos bajo una estructura de cooperativa. Uno de los objetivos principales sería empezar haciendo granos de cacao de alta calidad mediante el aumento de la calidad de la fermentación y el proceso de secado.
Como tienda nos beneficiaríamos de la cooperativa, ya que adquiriríamos el cacao directamente de ellos. Más allá, como los turistas continúen comprando nuestros productos, podría ayudar a poner el cacao de Lanquin dentro del mercado internacional de cacao fino. Ya estamos en contacto con muchos chocolateros de todo el mundo que están preparados para probar un poco.
Lo más importante, ¡podría representar un ingreso enorme para los agricultores locales, además de orgullo por su trabajo! ¿QUÉ NECESITAMOS? 1) 3 meses para la tienda: $500
Una vez más, es una localización fantástica en el mero centro del pueblo (que tiene millones de locales en los días de mercado) con una excelente visualización y un gran potential interior.
Un capital inicial de 3 meses debería ser más que suficiente para tener todo listo y llevarlo sin problemas.
2) 3 meses de salario para un empleado: $800
Queremos por lo menos un empleado local para trabajar en la tienda y ayudarnos allí. Aunque lo ideal serían dos.
Es una oportunidad genial de trabajo aquí, dónde el mercado de trabajo es extremadamente reducido. También usaremos la ayuda de los voluntarios (más que nada para tener gente de habla inglesa en la tienda, y con más conocimiento sobre los deseos de los turistas y técnicas de venda).
El objetivo es formar a los locales para que sean cuidadores eficientes de la tienda, así como representantes productivos en vendas.
El salario minimo aqui es de Q 1200 pero nosotros quieremos pagar Q 2000 como mínimo y, con tiempo, posibilidad de cobrar comisiones. De esta manera podría acabar con un salario bueno y estable. ¡Este tipo de desarrollo nos complacería mucho! 3) Mobiliario y decoración: $900
Mientas que es difícil de evaluar, tenemos toda la intención de ser frugales. Vivimos en un área que produce mucha madera para la construcción así que podemos comprar el material barato. Un buen amigo mío es carpintero y él está buscando un lugar dónde exponer su trabajo, así podemos trabajar en un descuento en el precio a cambio de su experiencia.
No necesitamos mucho para empezar. Unas estanterías y mesas, un gran trabajo de pintura dentro, unas cuantas plantas, bonitas lámparas y estaría listo. Continuaremos haciéndolo más bonito cuando avancemos. También tenemos una gran ventana que se abre a la calle, así que aunque el interior no esté completamente acabado, podemos empezar vendiendo. Lo más importante será la decoración de afuera, porque eso será lo que incitará a la gente a entrar. Para eso, vamos a empezar imprimiendo algún gran póster de vinilo, y, en el futuro queremos encontrar a una persona que pinte toda la fachada con decoración sobre el chocolate maya como temática.
4) Cacao: $400
Comprar buen cacao aquí no es tan fácil como debería ser, y esperemos que temprano lo sea. Sería demasiado largo para explicarlo aquí (pueden encontrar más sobre este tema en nuestra web), pero actualmente estamos trabajando en un proyecto de cultivo de permacultura para crear una cooperativa de cacao local y así producir granos de cacao de alta calidad.
Para poder apoyar en esto, estamos listos para comprar nuestro cacao por lo menos por el doble del precio normal local.
Con tanto, deberíamos  llegar fácilmente a los tres meses. Y si no… significaría que hemos vendido muchísimo, lo que es perfecto. Entonces, ¡solo tendríamos que ir a comprar más!
También intentaremos vender los granos de cacao directamente a los clientes des de la tienda.
5) Refrigeradora y estufa: $700
Aún y si pudiéramos empezar sin ellos, nos harían la vida mucho más fácil y menos estresada en término de suplementar y de demanda.
Muchos de nuestros productos necesitan estar en la nevera (masa de crepas, chocolates,…) para estar bien por un periodo de tiempo largo. Estamos en mitad de la jungla y aquí hace mucho calor y humedad.
Todos nuestros productos son muy saludables, naturales y hechos a mano, no tienen ningún tipo de conservante, así que la refrigeración es crucial. .
La estufa de gas  sería principalmente usada para tostar el cacao, hacer crepas y hacer pan. Y en el futuro, por qué no, podríamos hacer muchos otros pasteles y demás deliciosos productos de panadería (¡se me está permitido soñar con croissants de jungla!).
 


El impacto :
Este proyecto podría ser muy grande, tanto para la gente que vive en Lanquin, como para los visitantes.
- Obviamente, daría a todo el mundo un lugar para hacer el estómago feliz, comprar buen chocolate, productos naturales hechos a mano, tentempiés sanos, etc…
- Lanquin depende en su mayoría del turismo así que intentamos expandir la “reputación del chocolate” en el área, la cual es una gran productora  de cacao. Nuestra intención es que nuestro tour de chocolate se convierta en la atracción principal del área, y algo que atraiga a turistas de toda Guatemala.
- La creación de la cooperativa de cacao podría acabar trayendo el cacao local al mercado internacional del cacao fino. Estamos en contacto con bastantes chocolateros de todo el mundo, y ellos siempre están interesados en el cacao fino y sostenible como lo es el nuestro. Para los productores locales podría significar un incremento de 5-10 veces más su ingreso usual.
- También creará nuevos empleos en el área, y si funciona muy bien se podría empezar un proyecto mayor:  la fábrica de chocolate. Eso podría facilitar la ¡exportación de chocolate alrededor del globo!
 
Riesgos y Retos
Difícil de decir…
Una vez más, hemos estado realizando experimentos de ventas en los últimos tres meses y hasta ahora ha estado muy bien recibido.
Mucha de la población local, y la mayoría de hostales en el área, ahora conocen sobre nuestros productos, así que no debería de tomar mucho tiempo comenzar.
¡El real peligro sería si alguien lo hiciera antes que nosotros!
Uno de los retos podría realmente ser si acabamos vendiendo mucho más que lo anticipado, porque solo tenemos material para un negocio a pequeña escala… pero hey…. Si hacemos demasiado dinero y no suficientes productos, ¡entonces estaremos muy felices de comprar mejores máquinas y emplear a más trabajadores! Otras maneras en las que puede contactarnos Si tiene talento para pintar, le podemos tomar como voluntario para todo el trabajo de pintura.
También tomaremos voluntarios para ayudarnos con la elaboración de chocolate y para la tienda cuando esté abierta. Puede encontrar nuestro perfil de workaway aqui: WORKAWAY
Si puede y quiere ayudar de alguna otra forma, siéntase libre de contactarnos y veremos lo que podemos hacer.

<h3>Who am I and why this campaign?</h3>
<p>My name is Antigoni Chrysostomou and I am a Greek lady who was born and grew up in Thessaloniki and moved to Germany at the age of 16. My heart is always with my home country and my friends. This is how you can rely on me driving this project to success: I am holding a PhD in Physics and have a more than 20 years of management experience in the IT industry. I love making things happen and I know how to do it. Stelios and Kyriakos who will be running the business are more than close friends, they are family. They were running a successful shop for 18 years selling design objects and house decoration in the city of Serres, 80km away of Thessaloniki until the Greek economic crisis put an end to their cash flow. Your contribution will allow them build a new business and give you the chance to experience Greek hospitality.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Supporting this campaign is not only about helping two random individuals build a new business. It is also about showing solidarity with a country which was hit, beyond own responsibility, by financial interests of international banks and governments.  </p>
<p>My friends successfully run a lovely shop selling household design objects for 18 years in the small city of Serres, 80 kilometers northeast of Thessaloniki until the Greek economic crisis brought demand to zero. People stopped buying nice things for their houses or presents for friends. They had to close the shop in January 2019.  </p>
<p>If we receive more funds we will use them for renovation of the basement, the old fishing boat, the fence, the surroundings. <br/> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>""With a little help from my friends"" the project has already started and the team is determined to move ahead step by step. There is no way back, there is no stagnation. We believe in the completion of the project! However, there are some risks which we are sure we are going to overcome.</p>
<ul>
<li>Availability of skilled carpenters and other resources may delay the project</li>
<li>Winter timing for the renovation phase may be a hurdle despite the mild climate</li>
<li>We may not receive the complete funds required.</li>
</ul>
<p>My friends have already started seeking the resources and planning the building phases. The funds we receive will flow immediately into the planned work. If the funds are not sufficient we will relaunch a new campaign and intensify the advertisement of the project. <br/> </p>

I am starting this campaign to help my friends renovate a part of the house and start a new business for  a vacation home. This will be the perfect spot for people who like quiet hideaways.
My friends will welcome you to the 100sqm apartment with two bedrooms, a spacious living room, open kitchen, a terrace and fireplace. Be part of the vision and get the chance to relax near the waves in summer or winter!
You can get a glance at the house and the surroundings watching a publicly available video. The house and the olive tree garden are best seen on the left around minute 1:30. https://youtu.be/hC6Q7dyDMqE 
 
What We Need & What You Get

We need funds to completely renovate and equip the apartment on the elevated ground floor of the house.  Based on a detailed calculation (see at the end of the page for more details) we need 65.000 € to make it a nice and modern accommodation for people to love to spend time here. The apartment with its two bedrooms and a sofa bed in the living room can host up to 6 people. 
 
We have created a selection of rewards for you to come and stay if you contribute! Have a look at the perks. The vouchers will be valid for 5 years, so you are flexible with planning!
How to Donate with No Perk? (Extract from the Indiegogo Platform Instructions)

There is no risk for you that the house will not be completed. If this campaign does not provide the full funds, work will go ahead with the funds received and new campaign cycles will be launched. In parallel other ways of funding will be evaluated. 
Terms for the Rewards
Upon selection of a specific accommodation reward we will issue a voucher which will be valid for a stay until the 31.12.2025. The dates will be granted on a first come first serve basis.

The Team - The Hosts
Asterios (aka Stelios) Adamos, the Visionary!
A self-made man, an individual with high empathy and respect for people and culture, who values honesty and friendship with a sense for hospitality and extraordinary cooking abilities! Previous shop owner for design objects.

 
Kyriakos Pechlivanidis, the Practicioner!
A creative mind combined with high energy, he is making things work! Experienced in interior design, he has successfully designed many homes in the city of Serres. Previous shop owner for design furniture and objects. The apartment is his property.

 
Who am I and why this campaign?
My name is Antigoni Chrysostomou and I am a Greek lady who was born and grew up in Thessaloniki and moved to Germany at the age of 16. My heart is always with my home country and my friends. This is how you can rely on me driving this project to success: I am holding a PhD in Physics and have a more than 20 years of management experience in the IT industry. I love making things happen and I know how to do it. Stelios and Kyriakos who will be running the business are more than close friends, they are family. They were running a successful shop for 18 years selling design objects and house decoration in the city of Serres, 80km away of Thessaloniki until the Greek economic crisis put an end to their cash flow. Your contribution will allow them build a new business and give you the chance to experience Greek hospitality.

The Impact
Supporting this campaign is not only about helping two random individuals build a new business. It is also about showing solidarity with a country which was hit, beyond own responsibility, by financial interests of international banks and governments.  
My friends successfully run a lovely shop selling household design objects for 18 years in the small city of Serres, 80 kilometers northeast of Thessaloniki until the Greek economic crisis brought demand to zero. People stopped buying nice things for their houses or presents for friends. They had to close the shop in January 2019.  
If we receive more funds we will use them for renovation of the basement, the old fishing boat, the fence, the surroundings.  

Risks & Challenges
""With a little help from my friends"" the project has already started and the team is determined to move ahead step by step. There is no way back, there is no stagnation. We believe in the completion of the project! However, there are some risks which we are sure we are going to overcome.

Availability of skilled carpenters and other resources may delay the project
Winter timing for the renovation phase may be a hurdle despite the mild climate
We may not receive the complete funds required.

My friends have already started seeking the resources and planning the building phases. The funds we receive will flow immediately into the planned work. If the funds are not sufficient we will relaunch a new campaign and intensify the advertisement of the project.  
 

Other Ways You Can Help
You can contribute financially to the campaign with any even small value without choosing any of the rewards.
If you prefer mountains over seashore, if Greece is not your favorite destination, you may have friends who would want to join the campaign! Spread the word, invite your friends to participate!
You can use the Indiegogo share tools!

<p><i><em><i>A view of Mt. Kilimanjaro from Kasirwa Village, our building location<br/></i></em></i></p>
<br/>
<p><b></b></p>
<p>This October, Patricia Erimescu, a graduate of architecture at Universidad Politécnica de Madrid, is teaming up with Nka Foundation to head up a rammed earth
architecture workshop to build a volunteers quarter at the Kasirwa Arts Village in the
Kilimanjaro Region of Tanzania. The goal of the workshop is to design and build with earth and
other locally available materials to alter the local perception that earth
architecture is for the very poor because local mud houses are poorly
constructed. <br/></p><p><br/></p>
<p>Support this campaign by making a
donation today at any amount to help us with the costs of materials and other
site-based expenses. We can’t do it alone. And we will welcome you, if you can
come to volunteer at the construction site in Tanzania to build our design and help reinvent the
African Mud House. </p>
<p>On
the fringes of environmental issues and Open Source concept, Nka Foundation is
experimenting with earth to create an arts village at Kasirwa in Tanzania, as
an extension of their project in Ghana. In the Kasirwa area, 80% of the house
walls are built with lumber. Existing examples of mud homes are built by the
wattle-and-daub method and they erode over time due to water damage. We think that <strong><span>the rammed earth
workshop</span></strong> can help by
bringing together emerging arhitects, designers and volunteers from different
places to immerse in the local culture to collaborate and draw on local
resources and their professional knowledge to design and build a contemporary
mud house, which will serve as an example to the local community that earth
architecture can be beautiful and durable.</p>
<p>Be a part of this! Let’s create change
where it is most needed. </p>

</i></p><p><strong>HOW CAN YOU HELP?</strong></p>
<p><strong>By making a pledge!</strong>There’s
no getting around it. It works in partnership.  So, take a look at the
rewards we offer and sow a seed by donating generously and help us to reach
that goal! Every bit counts! Once you’ve made a pledge, please
promote this campaign to your friends and encourage them to back us too so we
can meet our target. </p>
<p><b>What We Need &amp; What
You Get</b></p>
<p>The overall
budget is 8000 USD for the
construction of the house from foundation to landscaping.
Half of this budget amount will be collected through project contribution from
the international participants in the workshop. Our goal in this campaign is to raise at the other half:</p>
<p><strong>$4,000</strong> to cover
materials, tools and other site-based expenses AND the small fee charged by the
funding platform and costs of getting out rewards to donors.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br/>
We expect to reach our funding goal. If we don’t reach the entire goal, we will
use the amount raised to<span>  build the walls
and the roof.  <br/></span></p>
<p>If we exceed our goal, the
additional money that is raised will be used to help reduce the project
participation fees to make the workshop more accessible and affordable. And
if we go over and beyond, it will be put towards building more stuff so you
will be pleased if you ever visit.<span>  </span></p>
<p><b>Other Ways You Can Help</b></p><p><b></b><span>Here are other ways you can help us reach our target
without it costing you a penny:</span></p>
<p><strong>(1) Spread the word about the campaign
to your own networks</strong>. It doesn’t take much time to send a
tweet, update your Facebook status or email to a colleague. Ask them to share
about this campaign and encourage their friends and colleagues to back us too.
Together, we can sow a seed to change the rural world.<strong>By all getting
involved, we can improve rural life deep in the village in Tanzania! </strong></p>
<p><strong>(2) If you practice architecture/design or
know of some students and recent graduates </strong>who would be interested in traveling
to Tanzania to participate in our workshop, let them contact Patricia Erimescu

<p><b>The Impact</b></p><p><span>We are not just asking you to donate; we are asking you
to participate in a project <span>to improve the built
environment and lives of one of the poorest communities in the world.
Quality mud building is a dying craft in rural Tanzania and lots of other
places. Our workshop creates the opportunity for cultural immersion and
learing-by-doing for architecture students who will work side-by-side with
local artisans. Design, budget, site-specific issues, and construction strategy
are all debated in an effort to create useful structures that meet local
needs. The results would include cross fertilization of knowldege and skills. <br/></span></span></p><p><span><span></span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441348843/ryuwhpr7rwgmtwecuuyw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

you are interested in rammed earth construction and living like locals at the
slope of Mt. Kilimanjaro, you can be a part of our team. Students can use the
opportunity for internship, personal research or thesis, because the
design-build workshop provides a unique opportunity for students to put to the
test their book knowledge for personal or professional development. At the end
of the project, they will learn to design what us buildable. <br/></p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441349471/hbmq0i4hzxkbuq69kqmx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

advance student of landscape architecture to landscape the completed unit to
blend with the rural landscape, an interior designer to organize the interior
spaces, a product designer to create the furniture and fittings, a
photographer/video artist for the documentary and a sculptor/painter to create
works of art to ardorn the interior/exterior spaces.<span>  <br/></span></p><p><span></span></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1441348947/uizkxukmwmlqougzzgju.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

learing-by-doing for architecture students who will work side-by-side with
local artisans. Design, budget, site-specific issues, and construction strategy
are all debated in an effort to create useful structures that meet local
needs. The results would include cross fertilization of knowldege and skills. 
A Design response to the Traditional Mud Hut of
the Masai people by the Workshop Leader, Patricia Erimescu .

If
you are interested in rammed earth construction and living like locals at the
slope of Mt. Kilimanjaro, you can be a part of our team. Students can use the
opportunity for internship, personal research or thesis, because the
design-build workshop provides a unique opportunity for students to put to the
test their book knowledge for personal or professional development. At the end
of the project, they will learn to design what us buildable. 

Proposal for the courtyard by Patricia Erimescu,  the workshop leader, 
For the
professionals, you will find the hands-on project and full-on experience with
the local culture, a pause from your office work to rediscover the rudiments of
design and artistic nuances that can refresh your practice.For example, our project needs a practitioner or an
advance student of landscape architecture to landscape the completed unit to
blend with the rural landscape, an interior designer to organize the interior
spaces, a product designer to create the furniture and fittings, a
photographer/video artist for the documentary and a sculptor/painter to create
works of art to ardorn the interior/exterior spaces.  
A proposal for the common dormitory by Patricia Erimescu .
Don’t worry, it is
all work… you will have short breaks from the construction project to visit
local attractions and participate in field trips.  After
the workshop, it is your time to relax and be a tourist. Remember, Nka Foundation is a nonprofit
organization; every penny we raise goes toward funding our projects.

<p>I'm writing down all the expenditure I'll have.</p>With a final goal of <strong>£</strong><b>60 000</b><strong>!</strong><br/> <p><b>1st</b> - <strong>I have bought a traditional house</strong> in the village which is in need <strong>renovating</strong>, I'll carry out the renovation paying particular attention to keeping the original and existing style!!!<br/>The barn will be turned into a 4 bedroom apartment as well, offering the best view of the village.<br/>This two renovations will cost me <strong>£</strong><b>15 000.</b> This is the first step and will enable us to accommodate our guests and create <strong>2 new jobs</strong> in the village. The reason why this is so cheap is because my family usually work together on these kind of projects, so there will be not much labour costs or company profits involved.<br/>Pictures, of the preparation works for the renovation, and the safety of the place.</p>

<p><b>2nd</b> - Bikes and minibus for tours<br/>- for the bike trips: <strong>20 bikes and helmets, a first aid box, and water and baggage carrying cart. </strong>All shall be high quality bikes, recommended by my friend who will lead the bike trips. These bikes will support a church owned bike charity, who import used bikes from the western countries. Helmets will be normal bike helmets and a basic first aid box. There will also ba a horse drawn cart for carrying baggage and water for bigger teams. All together this will cost <strong>£4000</strong>.</p>
<p>- for the hiking and minibus trips: <strong>1 Ford Transit minibus</strong> what is a wildly used and reliable van, a nine seater will give me the capacity to either carry a smaller team, or attend a hiking or biking trip. With additional <strong>first aid boxes</strong>. A used but good condition one is usually around £6000.</p>
<p>That is an other <strong>£10 000.</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492983632/ofdcevoyhkkqlk01tozy.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>3rd</strong> - Land</p>
<p>Land in Romania is £1000 on average, however this is on the cheaper side, as there are mountains rather than fertile plane lands. However because of the poor recording of ownership additional costs may apply. So the 20ha (200 000m2) the farm and the horses will need is no more than <strong>£10-15 000</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492981838/npvhudskp44hoqrroa21.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></strong></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>4th</strong> - Horses</p>
<p>Even though there are a lots of horses in Transylvania it is not that easy to find calm, reliable, and good nature horses which are easy to ride. My preference would be to buy 'Hucul' horses. The 'Hucul' is a small breed, which has origins in our area in the Carpathian Mountains, very reliable, and can be extensively kept. From <a href=""https://uk.pinterest.com/pin/351069733427678142/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lucina breeding centre</a> the likely cost would £800-1000 per horse. However most horse prices are between £500-1000. Ten horses is a perfect number to start with, enough for a circle of friends for a trip, and not too many to cause problems with feeding and looking after. That means <strong>£10 000</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1492982315/qgohfgopyrfpeybcbsmw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>5th</strong> - Farm Animals, and farm buildings</p>
<p>Our farm will be an organic, and traditional farm. Therefore it is important to have animals, and plants which are traditional, and are protected species.</p>
<p><a href=""http://www.geneconservation.hu/content/old-hungarian-farm-animals"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">This is an organisation where most of the Transylvanian species are bred.</a></p>
<p>All our animals and barns will cost <strong>£15 000</strong></p>
<p>This price includes cows and or buffalos (most expensive), pigs, sheep, rabbits and chickens (least expensive) as well. All of these animals have requirements about their living conditions, so the buildings are a must have in this case.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The plan itself!</h3>
<p>As I have shown you the economic side, This thing is going to be something very complex.<strong> </strong><br/><b>It is really important that I will employ only local people, and as many as possible, which will help them a lot!</b></p>
<p>Our plan is to do farming and tourism, and combine the two so you can have a taste of the realm of the country.</p>
<p><br/>With all our services you will have home-made food, home made Pálinka (the local spirit), fresh air, and wells. Accommodation will either be at the house, in tents, or in different villages in the case of longer tours.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2>The company will have <b>4+1 main services</b>:</h2>
<p><strong>- 1st Bike and minibus tours, hiking, horse riding</strong><br/>2-28 days long trips with all the interesting places on our routes, but mainly in the nature instead of busy roads. Many programs, sightseeing, living history and culture and of course all that while riding a horse/bike, walking or travelling by a minibus.</p>
<div><strong>- 2nd Farming (holiday and educational courses)</strong></div>
<p>This service will be the most diverse and the one the local people will most widely involved. You can watch, touch, taste all of it!<br/>From making hay, to harvesting, from cutting trees to wood carving, from milking to making cheese, to cut comma to wicker a basket, and many more.<br/>At a local friendly host family you would <strong>have </strong>nothing to do; but you <strong>can </strong>do everything. Try it out for yourself!</p>
<p>In the courses, you will be able to learn the traditional/ecological way of farming, building, and general living.</p>
<p><strong>- 3rd Handicraft courses</strong><br/>- Felting course; how to make felt from the shearing of the sheep through to the cleaning and colouring of the felting<br/>- Basket weaving; how to make a basket or any object from comma, from cutting through cleaning, weaving and colouring<br/><span style='font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;'>- Making cheese; how to make cheese from milking through preparation, tasting, making and maturing.<br/>- Local straw hat weaving; how to make a hat from harvest through selecting, to sew.<br/>- Blacksmith lessons. With the local gypsy blacksmith.<br/>- Pottery; how to make your own pot from digging and grinding through to making the pot.</span><br/><strong>All you make can be yours!</strong><br/>Home made food, home made Pálinka (local spirit), fresh air, and wells. Accommodation in the house or tents.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>- 4th Summer camps</strong><br/><span style='letter-spacing: 0px;font-family: ""Benton Sans"", Helvetica, sans-serif;'>- 9-11th century child camps with my Uncle, and his team, who has got over 15 years of experience.<br/>- surviving camps with ex military camp leader</span><br/>- dance camp, there is a folk dance and music camp in the village every year and we'll provide a translator for you<br/>- team building weekends<br/>- and many more</p>
<p> </p>
<p><b>- The extra one..... A run away home from £23 000 to £50 000</b></p>
<p>As<span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;""> I'm very committed to saving traditions my base will be an old village house restored in the traditional way. I will be doing that as i have some experience and, in my family, there are a few guys from the building industry. So in the future you might be able to own a restored house in this or a similar village for as little as £23 000.<br/>I'm happy to do a maintenance for use deal with you if you want so you have a free service, and I can have more accommodations.<br/><strong>You can choose this service also as a perk! Don't miss out!</strong></span></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div>As your help makes me independent from banks, pushy investors, or anything like that it gives me a good starting point! <b>It is the most important bit! Thank you!</b><br/><br/><strong>The language problem:</strong> is also a good reason to employ more people, especially local young people, who mainly study at universities. Also I've got connections all over Transylvania through my mother and her family, and my own trips, as I spent most of my holidays hitch-hiking all over the place. And of course I speak a few words and picking up more and more each time.</div><div> </div><div>
<strong>Competitors:</strong> Not many of them. Closest to us, which is similar is in the high mountains in the Hargita County.</div><div> </div><div>What if there are <strong>not enough guests</strong> in the first years. This is where the farming has an important role. As the plan to employ people I can't rely on tourism only or agriculture only. The two together will definitely make a whole so even if the first years are harder, there will be no minuses in the balance.</div><div> </div><div>Wolves, bears or even vampires!: well, I hiked Transylvania, for all-together more than 2 years, most of the time off road, and never had a problem. Anyway there will be a leader with every team, and GPS, phone, and attendant following you, at all times. So we will pay very high attention to your safety!<br/><br/> </div><div>

During my holidays from work I carried out the preparation work for this business, such as, field observation, finding team leaders, finding locals to host and discover and plan all interesting sites.

It is a great project, I started it, and now I need your help to make it all ready for YOU to try!
 
All of this is possible because of YOUR help! Thank you very much!
 
What do I need and what is it for?
So the business side is coming!
I'm writing down all the expenditure I'll have.With a final goal of £60 000! 1st - I have bought a traditional house in the village which is in need renovating, I'll carry out the renovation paying particular attention to keeping the original and existing style!!!The barn will be turned into a 4 bedroom apartment as well, offering the best view of the village.This two renovations will cost me £15 000. This is the first step and will enable us to accommodate our guests and create 2 new jobs in the village. The reason why this is so cheap is because my family usually work together on these kind of projects, so there will be not much labour costs or company profits involved.Pictures, of the preparation works for the renovation, and the safety of the place.




2nd - Bikes and minibus for tours- for the bike trips: 20 bikes and helmets, a first aid box, and water and baggage carrying cart. All shall be high quality bikes, recommended by my friend who will lead the bike trips. These bikes will support a church owned bike charity, who import used bikes from the western countries. Helmets will be normal bike helmets and a basic first aid box. There will also ba a horse drawn cart for carrying baggage and water for bigger teams. All together this will cost £4000.
- for the hiking and minibus trips: 1 Ford Transit minibus what is a wildly used and reliable van, a nine seater will give me the capacity to either carry a smaller team, or attend a hiking or biking trip. With additional first aid boxes. A used but good condition one is usually around £6000.
That is an other £10 000.

 
3rd - Land
Land in Romania is £1000 on average, however this is on the cheaper side, as there are mountains rather than fertile plane lands. However because of the poor recording of ownership additional costs may apply. So the 20ha (200 000m2) the farm and the horses will need is no more than £10-15 000


 
4th - Horses
Even though there are a lots of horses in Transylvania it is not that easy to find calm, reliable, and good nature horses which are easy to ride. My preference would be to buy 'Hucul' horses. The 'Hucul' is a small breed, which has origins in our area in the Carpathian Mountains, very reliable, and can be extensively kept. From Lucina breeding centre the likely cost would £800-1000 per horse. However most horse prices are between £500-1000. Ten horses is a perfect number to start with, enough for a circle of friends for a trip, and not too many to cause problems with feeding and looking after. That means £10 000

5th - Farm Animals, and farm buildings
Our farm will be an organic, and traditional farm. Therefore it is important to have animals, and plants which are traditional, and are protected species.
This is an organisation where most of the Transylvanian species are bred.
All our animals and barns will cost £15 000
This price includes cows and or buffalos (most expensive), pigs, sheep, rabbits and chickens (least expensive) as well. All of these animals have requirements about their living conditions, so the buildings are a must have in this case.
 Where will your money go if I don't reach the goal?
Not a single penny will be wasted!
It is all going to go into this project, I bought the house, and love it way too much to give up! So my hope is in you! And I can't wait to see you around! The amount of the expense however may vary, so I can serve whatever customer requirements we'll have.
Where your money will go if I get more than I need to start?
If it will be more than the £60 000 which is the absolute success it is going to a charity organisation.
http://szentferencalapitvany.org/

In Transylvania there is a monk 'Brother Csaba' who has established a huge childcare organisation for children from poor/complicated/orphan etc. background. I really admire what he is doing and want to help the children myself.
 

The plan itself!
As I have shown you the economic side, This thing is going to be something very complex. It is really important that I will employ only local people, and as many as possible, which will help them a lot!
Our plan is to do farming and tourism, and combine the two so you can have a taste of the realm of the country.
With all our services you will have home-made food, home made Pálinka (the local spirit), fresh air, and wells. Accommodation will either be at the house, in tents, or in different villages in the case of longer tours.
 
The company will have 4+1 main services:
- 1st Bike and minibus tours, hiking, horse riding2-28 days long trips with all the interesting places on our routes, but mainly in the nature instead of busy roads. Many programs, sightseeing, living history and culture and of course all that while riding a horse/bike, walking or travelling by a minibus.
- 2nd Farming (holiday and educational courses)
This service will be the most diverse and the one the local people will most widely involved. You can watch, touch, taste all of it!From making hay, to harvesting, from cutting trees to wood carving, from milking to making cheese, to cut comma to wicker a basket, and many more.At a local friendly host family you would have nothing to do; but you can do everything. Try it out for yourself!
In the courses, you will be able to learn the traditional/ecological way of farming, building, and general living.
- 3rd Handicraft courses- Felting course; how to make felt from the shearing of the sheep through to the cleaning and colouring of the felting- Basket weaving; how to make a basket or any object from comma, from cutting through cleaning, weaving and colouring- Making cheese; how to make cheese from milking through preparation, tasting, making and maturing.- Local straw hat weaving; how to make a hat from harvest through selecting, to sew.- Blacksmith lessons. With the local gypsy blacksmith.- Pottery; how to make your own pot from digging and grinding through to making the pot.All you make can be yours!Home made food, home made Pálinka (local spirit), fresh air, and wells. Accommodation in the house or tents.
 
- 4th Summer camps- 9-11th century child camps with my Uncle, and his team, who has got over 15 years of experience.- surviving camps with ex military camp leader- dance camp, there is a folk dance and music camp in the village every year and we'll provide a translator for you- team building weekends- and many more
 
- The extra one..... A run away home from £23 000 to £50 000
As I'm very committed to saving traditions my base will be an old village house restored in the traditional way. I will be doing that as i have some experience and, in my family, there are a few guys from the building industry. So in the future you might be able to own a restored house in this or a similar village for as little as £23 000.I'm happy to do a maintenance for use deal with you if you want so you have a free service, and I can have more accommodations.You can choose this service also as a perk! Don't miss out!
 
Risks & Challenges
As your help makes me independent from banks, pushy investors, or anything like that it gives me a good starting point! It is the most important bit! Thank you!The language problem: is also a good reason to employ more people, especially local young people, who mainly study at universities. Also I've got connections all over Transylvania through my mother and her family, and my own trips, as I spent most of my holidays hitch-hiking all over the place. And of course I speak a few words and picking up more and more each time. 
Competitors: Not many of them. Closest to us, which is similar is in the high mountains in the Hargita County. What if there are not enough guests in the first years. This is where the farming has an important role. As the plan to employ people I can't rely on tourism only or agriculture only. The two together will definitely make a whole so even if the first years are harder, there will be no minuses in the balance. Wolves, bears or even vampires!: well, I hiked Transylvania, for all-together more than 2 years, most of the time off road, and never had a problem. Anyway there will be a leader with every team, and GPS, phone, and attendant following you, at all times. So we will pay very high attention to your safety! 
 
It would be a really big help if you pass through the info about this plan! Tell it to all around you, family, friends, whoever you see on the roads and all the people on the bus! ;)

It is really important that this site, and later the company get good marketing, so now, soon or even later than that  please spread it!

Website is coming soon, as well!

As I really appreciate your effort sharing this news I set up an extra PERK so if you have supported us, by even just £1.00 and your friends who do as well comment your user name on this project you will be invited for the opening celebrations, and have the same goods as if you'd have supported us by £250.
Thank you very much!
 
Hope to see you hiking soon! ;)

<p><b>Background</b><br/></p>
<p>Agri Connexions Africa founder, Courtney Dehn-Gurbacki, started this project in

Africa, Courtney knew that she wanted to find constructive ways to
contribute to improving the lives of others.</p>
<p>With
this goal in mind, Courtney planned and funded a trip to South Africa, Malawi
and Namibia to learn more about sustainable agriculture and community development. She became involved
with the producers in Zambezi Region (the geographic focus of this project)
after a friend invited her to visit his PhD fieldwork site where he had been
assisting the community with proposals to improve sustainable vegetable production in the region. Courtney quickly became involved and
decided to focus all her efforts on making this proposal a reality.</p>

<p><b>What is our solution?</b></p>
<p>Alternative and diverse crop production, affordable irrigation technology, and water-conserving/sustainable cultivation practices</p><p>Looking for an
alternative and more reliable source of food and income, farmers in Mwanzi Area
(the geographic focus of our project) have
been growing small amounts of vegetables, mostly irrigating with buckets in the
dry season. However, the key limitation to more production is irrigation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>An
irrigated farm means the opportunity to cultivate a larger area, to increase
the number of growing seasons and to sell extra produce to the markets.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We have worked
with the a group of small-scale farmers and vegetable producers, who have come
together to form the Mashandilo Co-operative (meaning ‘the place you go to get
help’). The community has devised this project to give farmers in the area an
opportunity to cultivate different kinds of crops year-round with
irrigation, training and market development.</p>
<p>We have
started small with a pilot project called Tuyeleke (‘Let’s Try’) in the local
Sifwe language. </p><p>

(compost-production, crop rotation and natural pest-management)</p>
<p><span>• </span>Cultivating support from local partners- Ministry

started small with a pilot project called Tuyeleke (‘Let’s Try’) in the local
Sifwe language. 
What have we done so far?
Phase 1: Tuyeleke (‘Let’s Try’)
• Feasibility
study to ensure the project is viable and sustainable
• Developing new gardens and improving exisiting gardens with Mashandilo Co-operative members to provide food for family use for over 70 people in Kongola Constituency
• 
Developing
demonstration gardens- producers are trialling techniques that are not used widely in the region
(compost-production, crop rotation and natural pest-management)
• Cultivating support from local partners- Ministry
of Agriculture, Governor
of Zambezi Region, Namibia National Farmer’s Union (our local partner), Mafwe
Traditional Authority (local Chief), Namibia Organic Association and Kwandu
Conservancy and Community Forest.
What do we plan to do next? (what we are fundraising for now)
• 
Improve affordable irrigation by piloting manually operated treadle pumps and micro drip irrigation systems 
•  Production skills training- the co-operative members have identified key areas where they would like to strengthen their skills, namely soil fertility management and pest and disease management
• Develop market links- extra produce not consumed will be sold by the co-operative and we will provide business management trainings as they develop a marketplace for their produce
• 
We plan to implement this phase from January
2016- December 2016


What impact are we making?

Independence: opportunity to
grow and sell crops year round, increased income so
farmers can afford food, education and healthcare for their families
Economic
development:
farm families sell vegetable crops in the market place, farmers
become self-sustaining (able to buy seeds and other inputs), job creation
Food security: increased
capacity to withstand droughts and sustain families with
food and income, less reliance on food aid

Where does the money go?
• Treadle pumps and micro drip irrigation equipment to pilot
• Training (from Namibia Organic Association, Kasisi Agricultural Training Center) and exchange visits to learn from established vegetable producers
• 
Seeds (until producers can save/buy their own)
• 
Fencing (to keep animals out of the gardens)
• 
Garden
equipment- wheel barrows, shade net, sprayers

<p>My family and I moved to the small town of Roxboro to give our kids a good start in a home of our own. We wanted our kids to have the special kind of memories that they will look back on with fondness when they have kids of their own. We wanted playing in the backyard, chasing fireflies, growing a garden, going to school with the same faces for years, making friends for a lifetime, local stores with familiar faces for special treats, favorite little hangouts in town with friends.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not all of that is possible right now.</p>
<p>That is why I want to open a used bookstore. I want to provide a place to be that little local store with special treats, a favorite hangout for friends, young and not so young. Bookstores, and books, have always provided fond memories for me, which is why I earned my Bachelors in English from Arizona State University. The smell of old books mingling with the soothing warmth of coffee and hot chocolate, and the sweet tingle of cookies or cake always invokes those memories for me, drawing a smile, and I want to pass those feelings on to my children, and to other people.</p>
<p>With your help, I can provide a local hangout to a town working hard to bring life back to its self, and to give used books a second chance at the same time, in a building that once held fond memories for the older members for the community, but needs some love to be that place for newer generations. Roxboro used to be an up and coming, happening, place to be in the 50's, 60's, and 70's, with two gorgeous theaters, dozens of store fronts and restaurants. It has since fallen on hard times, and is now working hard to be that happening place again.</p>
<p>We can provide a warm place for a first time parent to pick out a book to read their newborn to sleep, Goodnight Moon. We can help a child to have their very first adventure in the Hundred Acre Wood. We can help an 11 year old receive their letter to Hogwarts along with Harry. We can help a preteen discover Narnia in the back of their wardrobe. We can aid a teenager on his quest to destroy the One Ring. We can have a space for children to safely hangout while their parents browse the shelves, perhaps looking for that guilty pleasure with a purple cover, or becoming that gathering place for meetings between friends, or book clubs. A place where students come to find just the right book for class, and to study. We can be that place where a local author sees their book for sale for the first time.</p>
<p>With your help, I can work magic.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>What We Need &amp; What You Get</strong></p>
<p>Our goal to reach is $10,000. The majority of the money will go towards leasing or purchasing the building, getting everything inside set up properly, and for paying utilities for the building. I will use a portion of it to purchase whatever inventory and supplies I don't already have. Any remaining money will go into a business bank account for use just for the bookstore.</p>
<p>Keep an eye out for exciting perks! Our featured perk is a large 100% cotton reusable canvas tote bag: fashionable, great for the environment, and great to carry your new books home in! Pre-launch contributors and those who contribute over $100 will get to show off their rock star status and have their name painted on the wall of the store!</p>
<p>If we don't reach our goal, the money will be placed into an business account, where it will be kept, and added to, until our goal can finally be reached, or an ideal location for the store can be found.</p>
<p><strong>The Impact</strong></p>
<p>Our town does not have a multi-subject bookstore in it, or within a 45 minute drive in any direction. The closest things we have are a Christian bookstore, or WalMart. We do have a public library, but as with most libraries, there are limited hours, and a limit to how many books you can check out. We will have longer operating hours, and, of course, no limit to how many books you can buy. With over 8,000 people in town, and over 39,000 people in the county, that's almost 40,000 people with no access to a bookstore within an easy distance.</p>
<p>Having a bookstore in town would give uptown a family friendly place to hangout together, a place for book clubs to hold meetings, and for students to study.</p>
<p>The store would also have a spotlight for local authors, helping them build their audience.</p>
<p>I am supportive of our First Responders (Police, Sheriffs, EMTs, and Fire Dept.), Active Military, and Veterans, and they are always welcome to stop by for a free cup of coffee.</p>
<p><strong>Risks &amp; Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Anytime someone opens up a small business, there is a risk, which is common knowledge. Most small businesses don't make it past the five year mark, but with the love and support of family and friends, and the growing support of the community, I think we can make it.</p>
<p>I am a highly driven individual willing to put in the time and effort it takes to make the store a success. I graduated from college Cum Laude all while taking care of two young children, a husband, and a home. It has taught me time management and risk assessment. </p>
<p><strong>Other Ways You Can Help</strong></p>
<p>I realize that not everyone can contribute monetarily, and that is okay! Instead, please get the word out. Share this page with everyone you know, and ask them to share with everyone they know. Use the Indigogo share tools when you can! </p>

<p>My name is Bob, and I am the owner of BattleCityGym. Operating in the Long Island, NY area, it has been my dream for the past several years to open our very own gaming retail store so the Long Island players and families could have a place to share their love for gaming.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1521691879/gfn85idu2y048dupvlr8.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Our story started 10 years ago when my 7-year-old son wanted to play Pokemon. He found an event from the Pokemon website that was located about 20 miles away. When we arrived, our first impression was that it was a very small store that could hardly serve 20 players. He competed and came in 1st place, and we were surprised to find out it was a City Championship tournament that is only held once a year. Even more passionate about the game now, my son continued to search the Pokemon website for the next two years and couldn't find any events in our area.</p>
<p>After two years of still not having a location for the Pokemon players to gather and play, I decided to contact our local gaming store and The Pokemon Company Int. to arrange for us to start running weekly tournaments. After the first year, The Pokemon Company Int. decided to make me a Premier Tournament Organizer for the Long Island area. Since then, I have worked as a judge for their State, Regional, National, and World Championships, in addition to the events I was already running at our local gaming store.</p>
<p>Over the past several years I have continued to use my experience as a judge, organizer, and sales representative, to bring the best events possible to the gaming community. This now includes other trading-card and collectible card games, board games, tabletop games, and video games, in addition to our Pokemon events (which we typically attract at least sixty players to – the limit before we have can no longer accept participants due to space restrictions).</p>
<p>After 8 years of running events at local gaming stores and conventions, I made it my priority to listen to all the players and families, and their biggest complaint about other gaming stores is that they are either too small, not very clean, or don’t offer much to purchase other than gaming supplies. Imagine bringing your child to an event or store and the only experience you bring back is that it's overcrowded or unclean – no parent or player should ever have this type of experience.</p>
<p>Our events are extremely well organized, staffed, and run in a way that everyone goes home with a great experience. Quite often the players and parents mention that we should open our own store.</p>
<p>One thing to mention is I love the stores that we run our events at; we have made a lot of money for the stores in sales and commissions from our events. But over the years, the stores either started to ask for more money for us to run events in their stores or have had to cut us out in the attempt to run their own events. This hasn't gone over well with the players and most of them stopped going to those stores because of it.</p>
<p>It's now time to take that big leap and open a store that everyone will love. Our store will be spacious enough to handle 60+ players and still have space for the parents to be able to sit and talk with each other while they wait (or play themselves!).

<p>As with any new business venture, there are always risks and challenges. The biggest risk is the business fails in the first year. The failure would be dependent on poor overall sales, which ultimately stems from both poor traffic and inventory. I’ve assessed these risks and have created strategies to overcome them.</p>
<p><strong><i>Traffic</i></strong>. Successful retail is dependent on traffic (whether you are online or brick and mortar). In order to draw traffic, we plan on doing the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be in a stellar location alongside other stores that we can draft off of</li>
<li>Provide special in-store events, collaborations, and cross-promotions within and outside of the gaming market</li>
<li>Added services such as rewards program that awards points for all purchases and event entries</li>
<li>Advanced preorders that will help us make sure we get the products in the hands of the players as soon as they are released</li>
<li>Online sales with pick-up from store option</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><i>Inventory</i></strong>. One of the biggest challenges will be keeping up with inventory and being nimble based on market demands. I plan on handling this by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paying close attention to what our customers are interested in.</li>
<li>Use a Point of Sale system to manage inventory and ensure we have enough of the right products during key times</li>
<li>Stay on top of new products being released and finding the best deals from our distributors </li>

</div></div>","My name is Bob, and I am the owner of BattleCityGym. Operating in the Long Island, NY area, it has been my dream for the past several years to open our very own gaming retail store so the Long Island players and families could have a place to share their love for gaming.

Our story started 10 years ago when my 7-year-old son wanted to play Pokemon. He found an event from the Pokemon website that was located about 20 miles away. When we arrived, our first impression was that it was a very small store that could hardly serve 20 players. He competed and came in 1st place, and we were surprised to find out it was a City Championship tournament that is only held once a year. Even more passionate about the game now, my son continued to search the Pokemon website for the next two years and couldn't find any events in our area.
After two years of still not having a location for the Pokemon players to gather and play, I decided to contact our local gaming store and The Pokemon Company Int. to arrange for us to start running weekly tournaments. After the first year, The Pokemon Company Int. decided to make me a Premier Tournament Organizer for the Long Island area. Since then, I have worked as a judge for their State, Regional, National, and World Championships, in addition to the events I was already running at our local gaming store.
Over the past several years I have continued to use my experience as a judge, organizer, and sales representative, to bring the best events possible to the gaming community. This now includes other trading-card and collectible card games, board games, tabletop games, and video games, in addition to our Pokemon events (which we typically attract at least sixty players to – the limit before we have can no longer accept participants due to space restrictions).
After 8 years of running events at local gaming stores and conventions, I made it my priority to listen to all the players and families, and their biggest complaint about other gaming stores is that they are either too small, not very clean, or don’t offer much to purchase other than gaming supplies. Imagine bringing your child to an event or store and the only experience you bring back is that it's overcrowded or unclean – no parent or player should ever have this type of experience.
Our events are extremely well organized, staffed, and run in a way that everyone goes home with a great experience. Quite often the players and parents mention that we should open our own store.
One thing to mention is I love the stores that we run our events at; we have made a lot of money for the stores in sales and commissions from our events. But over the years, the stores either started to ask for more money for us to run events in their stores or have had to cut us out in the attempt to run their own events. This hasn't gone over well with the players and most of them stopped going to those stores because of it.
It's now time to take that big leap and open a store that everyone will love. Our store will be spacious enough to handle 60+ players and still have space for the parents to be able to sit and talk with each other while they wait (or play themselves!). Features we’ll incorporate that other stores do not have are a rewards program for all purchases and event entries, family game nights, and special events.
 

Our mission is not to just open another game store but a place that the players and families will call home for all their favorite games. A few years ago we adopted the tagline ""Tournament Central"" since we run some of the best ran and organized events around, according to the players. We will continue to work with the gaming companies to bring even more events to the players. These event will help the players earn invites and/or points to even bigger events like Pro Tours, Regional, National, and even Worlds for games like Magic The Gathering, Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Dragonball Super, Cardfight Vanguard, X-Wing, Star Wars Armada, Warhammer 40K, ARG special events, and plus much much more.
We are very happy about our brand and the players know that when they see our name or logo, they know they will be presented with a friendly qualified staff for any events we run.
 

Here are the basics of what is needed to open a new store:

Lease of a store that is around 1000sqft
Store fixtures and displays
Point of Sale system
Loyalty point system
Kiosk system for store singles. 
Tables and chairs for the players
Inventory

<h2><font color=""ff00cc"">Why bra sized swimsuits?</font></h2>
<p align=""justify"">As a co-owner of A Sophisticated Pair, a lingerie boutique in Burlington, NC, my ongoing goal is to provide customers with a range of products, styles, and sizes as well as offer expert fit advice in a ""Judgement Free"" space. For over seven years, I have been fitting people in the correct bra size, helping them choose the right style for their breast shape, lifestyle, and budgetary needs, and two years ago, we branched out to swimwear through another Indiegogo campaign. Our business was inspired by my personal bra shopping experiences and how much I struggled with selection, sizing, and fit, and swimwear is no different. Before opening the store, my swimsuit shopping escapades ended in tears more than success because <strong>nothing ever fit!</strong> I vividly remember spending an entire day driving all over the state trying to find something—<strong>no, anything</strong>—which didn't make me feel horrible about myself. Color, style, and print became irrelevant, and my confidence suffered. In the picture below, I am chilling at the lake in literally the best fitting top I could find. No support, no shape, and the halter straps pulled uncomfortably into my neck. But hey, I didn't fall out, so that's something, right? </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1487788067/ad5zerehkaagci2qlro5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p align=""justify"">After we opened, I discovered many of the same manufacturers who created our awesome bras also had swimsuits in actual bra sizes. And no, these aren't generic ""Fits to a D cup"" type tops. These are suits in sizes like 30D, 34H, 40E, 44J, and so on. They lift! They shape! And they are freakin' cute! Last year, I bought this little gem from Elomi in my bra size UK 34H, and I couldn't get over the difference. I had been buying the wrong swimsuits my whole life!</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1548344415/mzu1fbvqfy205wtnuxlg.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p align=""justify"">As soon as our customers heard about the glorious world of bra sized swim, the requests came pouring in for us to include them. After all, NC is a beautiful state with lots of lakes, beaches, and rivers, to say nothing of private pools, and it's easier to enjoy warm weather if you aren't adjusting your boobs every few minutes. However, swim is super expensive, especially for a smaller shop like ours, particularly if we want to be more representative with size, style, and colors. </p>
<h2><font color=""#ff00cc"">Wait, didn't you just say you did this crowd-source thing before?</font></h2>
<p align=""justify"">Yes! Back in 2017, we raised almost $5,000 to bring in a modest assortment of swim into the shop, and then we cautiously expanded to a few new styles last year as well. However, swimwear remains the single most expensive product we stock, and we received some criticisms about our selection. To truly do swimwear justice, we need the help of our customers. My open cash flow allows me to carry a few styles in select sizes, but if people contribute to the campaign, essentially prepaying for their new swimsuits plus gaining extra perks, we can do so much more for our customers. There are a wealth of styles, colors, sizes, and brands available, and with the last campaign, we were able to dip our toes in the water. This year, I want to dive in headfirst and explore. <strong>I want people to have the option of trying on multiple suits in different fits and sizes—to find that perfect confidence boosting piece that makes you feel beautiful and sexy and courageous.</strong> Without this campaign, we'll rely primarily on what we currently stock, four pre-booked style, and special orders, meaning you may not be able to leave the shop with a swimsuit on the day you visit. Crowdsourcing allows us to pull resources together to improve the shop for everyone.</p>
</div><div>
<h2><font color=""#ff00cc"">How much do you need?</font></h2>
<p align=""justify"">Because we only sell high quality products, the wholesale cost on a bikini top is comparable to the cost of our bras, but a one-piece or a tankini? The added material creates a wholesale cost almost double that of a normal bra. Now factor in over 125 different sizes to represent, and the investment total adds up quickly. The shop has allocated around $3,000 of our spring buying budget to supplement our existing stock and any fundraising results, but we are aiming for an additional $10,000 with the campaign. Aside from factoring in wholesale costs, we also have the following expenses:</p>
<ul>
<li>$350-400 in estimated shipping costs from manufacturers</li>
<li>$300-350 in estimated storage and fixtures to accommodate the extra inventory</li>
<li>General cost of the perks, including the added store credit and the profit lost through discount coupons for larger contributions</li>
<li><p>Indiegogo fees totaling 8% of funds raised plus 30 cents per contribution (includes platform and credit card fees)</p></li>
<li><p>Indiegogo now withholds 5% of the funds raised for six months to allow for refunds, meaning as much $500 of the goal will not be given to us until after swim season.</p></li>
</ul>
<p align=""justify"">While $10,000 is our ultimate goal, I have tiered plans depending on how much we ultimately raise, each revolving around unique swimwear color groups from our brands. Coordinating collections usually consist of two to three top styles plus a few matching bottom options, and we will balance variety both in terms of shape and size but also in color and print.</p>
<ul>
<li>$2,500: At least two collections</li>
<li>$5,000: At least four collections</li>
<li>$7,500: At least six collections</li>
<li>$10,000: At least eight collections</li>
</ul>
<p align=""justify"">You'll notice I use ""at least"" in my campaign promises. No, I'm not going all politician on you. <strong>Like any retail business, sales fuel growth, and it is my intention for the campaign to essentially jump start our swim expansion.</strong> As we continue to sell items in-store, we can funnel the profits into more styles than originally planned, particularly because certain prints and colors do not release until well after the campaign ends. </p>
<h2><font color=""ff00cc"">How much are swimsuits and what styles are available?</font></h2>
<p align=""justify"">As with bras and lingerie, swim prices vary depending on size, style, and manufacturer. Generally, the more bells and whistles to the design, the higher the retail price. Our store price range will be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bikini Tops: $50 to $80</li>
<li>Tankini Tops: $70 to $130</li>
<li>One-Piece Suits: $80 to $150</li>
<li>Matching Bottoms: $25 to $60</li>
</ul>
<p align=""justify"">We'll focus primarily on bikini and tankini pieces and accompanying bottoms with one-pieces being fund-raising dependent. Sizes range from 28 to 44 bands with cups from B to UK K/US O. Check out a few of the many styles we're considering in the images section of the campaign.</p>
<h2><font color=""ff00cc"">Why should I donate?</font></h2>
<p align=""justify"">We realize this an atypical request of a retail store. Usually, expansion is an internal decision by the business owner, and I personally wavered on the decision to revisit crowd-souring again for the season. However, a small selection disappoints people, and the ones who wait last minute (you know who you are) may be forced to settle on something not quite right for the sake of time. If we took a risk and used credit to expand beyond what cash flow allowed, then we could end up unable to pay vendors or place new orders until sales picked up enough to pay back the investment. I value my vendors and prefer to play it safe rather than mess up relationships I have spent over seven years cultivating. As a result, <strong>I thought all of us could work together to make this year a dynamic, exciting year for the Piedmont Triad region by bringing in a big selection of swim everyone can enjoy!</strong> </p>
<p align=""justify""><strong>I also want to stress that contributing to our campaign is risk-free.</strong> We have been in business for over seven years and have no plans of closing. What you donate will be made available to you via a downloadable gift certificate good toward any purchase in the store. That's right. <strong>You don't even have to spend your donation on swimwear.</strong> By paying it forward early, you afford us the opportunity to expand quickly and keep fresh inventory cycling into the shop as the season progresses. Not to mention, we're offering some sweet perks as a way of thanking you for supporting the store:</p>
<ul>
<li>$25 Contribution: $30 in Store Credit</li>
<li>$50 Contribution: $55 in Store Credit plus 5% off an entire purchase coupon. </li>
<li>$75 Contribution: $80 in Store Credit plus 5% off an entire purchase coupon.</li>
<li>$100 Contribution: $105 in Store Credit plus 10% off an entire purchase coupon.</li>
<li>$125 Contribution: $130 in Store Credit plus 10% off an entire purchase coupon.</li>
<li>$150 Contribution: $155 in Store Credit plus 10% off an entire purchase coupon.</li>
<li>$175 Contribution: $180 in Store Credit plus 15% off an entire purchase coupon.</li>
<li>$200 Contribution: $205 in store Credit plus 15% off an entire purchase coupon.</li>
</ul>
<p align=""justify"">Every contribution nets you $5 in bonus store credit, and higher donation amounts gain added discounts on entire purchases, including items other than swim! Furthermore, the donations work in conjunction with our existing customer loyalty program, making the savings greater for early contributions.</p>
<h2><font color=""ff00cc"">When will the swimwear be available in the store?</font></h2>
<p align=""justify"">We currently have existing inventory with planned arrivals for February, March, and May. Additional styles will arrive two to four weeks after the campaign ends. Check out this beautiful style from Panache called Portofino that we currently stock:</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1548352586/eynvoxv47zlj9vfconqj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<h2><font color=""ff00cc"">If I contribute, does that guarantee my size and the suit of my choice will be in stock?</font></h2>
<p align=""justify"">Unfortunately, no. Our sizing assortment will be based primarily on our best-selling bra sizes and previous swim sales; however, contributors can guarantee their size in a style of their choosing by contacting me directly or leaving a note with their donation. I will personally include these in our orders, but keep in mind some swim pieces have release dates later in the season which may require waiting. If you have any questions about release dates or availability in your size, please email me or call the store. <strong>But remember: Your contributions are not limited to swim and can be used to restock your bra wardrobe too!</strong></p>
<h2><font color=""ff00cc"">What if I like your store but am not interested in swimwear?</font></h2>
<p align=""justify"">You can still donate to the swimwear fund because all donations are transferable to store credit. The flip side of the store's contribution to swimwear is that we are essentially funneling most of our intimate apparel expansion money for spring into swim. Consequently, we won't have much left over for adding new bras, shapewear, lingerie, or other intimate apparel until after swim season is over. I planned a few additions to keep the inventory fresh, but without a strong campaign, the shop will not experience the surge of new colors, prints, and styles as in past years. Swim is our expansion, but if we can offset the cost of adding swim to the shop, then our intimate apparel budget will rebound quickly and lead to faster expansion in other avenues.<strong> Profit directly supports growth and allows us to become stronger as a business by addressing consumer demands and filling gaps in the marketplace In short, profit is a <i>good </i>thing. </strong></p>
</div><div>
<h2><font color=""ff00cc"">What if you raise more than $10,000?</font></h2>
<p align=""justify"">I'm not one to count chicks before they hatch or whatever your colloquialism-of-choice is for being overly and possibly naively optimistic about . . . well . . . anything. I was pretty sure the store wasn't going to make it a year, so taking my firmly realistic outlook aside, I do believe the campaign could exceed my high expectations. If we raise more than $10,000, I will poll our contributors about whether they prefer the extra amount be available for swim or for expanding to other inventory. In our recent annual survey, many customers asked for more options in shapewear and lounge clothes.  </p>
</div><div>
<h2><font color=""ff00cc"">I can't contribute now, but I want to help. What can I do?</font></h2>
<p align=""justify"">As a small business owner who operates on a shoestring budget and has had one financial hit after another last year, largely due to my business partner and father's cancer scare, I totally get you may not be able to contribute within the window of our campaign. You know your budget, and as always, this is a judgment free space. That said, if you want to help, do so by encouraging others to contribute:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share the campaign on social media as often as you can. Our shop has accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and Youtube, and we will be posting updates often to encourage contributions.</li>
<li>Send the campaign to friends and family who could benefit from our goals. Or, let's get real for a sec, send it to the ones who complain every summer when it's time to shop. They will thank you.</li>

<h2><font color=""ff00cc"">A Word of Gratitude</font></h2>
<p align=""justify"">Finally, before we even get into the thick of promoting the campaign, I want to thank everyone who has taken the time to give your feedback to us regarding swim, who has been patient with us as we kept slowly expanding from year to year, who has referred the shop to friends and family (sometime forcefully dragging them in to be fitted!), and who supported us when we were just a small, barely stocked store running on the power of dreams. You have built us into the store we are today. and in so doing, you have given me a special gift for which I am eternally thankful. </p>

</div></div>","Why bra sized swimsuits?
As a co-owner of A Sophisticated Pair, a lingerie boutique in Burlington, NC, my ongoing goal is to provide customers with a range of products, styles, and sizes as well as offer expert fit advice in a ""Judgement Free"" space. For over seven years, I have been fitting people in the correct bra size, helping them choose the right style for their breast shape, lifestyle, and budgetary needs, and two years ago, we branched out to swimwear through another Indiegogo campaign. Our business was inspired by my personal bra shopping experiences and how much I struggled with selection, sizing, and fit, and swimwear is no different. Before opening the store, my swimsuit shopping escapades ended in tears more than success because nothing ever fit! I vividly remember spending an entire day driving all over the state trying to find something—no, anything—which didn't make me feel horrible about myself. Color, style, and print became irrelevant, and my confidence suffered. In the picture below, I am chilling at the lake in literally the best fitting top I could find. No support, no shape, and the halter straps pulled uncomfortably into my neck. But hey, I didn't fall out, so that's something, right? 

After we opened, I discovered many of the same manufacturers who created our awesome bras also had swimsuits in actual bra sizes. And no, these aren't generic ""Fits to a D cup"" type tops. These are suits in sizes like 30D, 34H, 40E, 44J, and so on. They lift! They shape! And they are freakin' cute! Last year, I bought this little gem from Elomi in my bra size UK 34H, and I couldn't get over the difference. I had been buying the wrong swimsuits my whole life!

As soon as our customers heard about the glorious world of bra sized swim, the requests came pouring in for us to include them. After all, NC is a beautiful state with lots of lakes, beaches, and rivers, to say nothing of private pools, and it's easier to enjoy warm weather if you aren't adjusting your boobs every few minutes. However, swim is super expensive, especially for a smaller shop like ours, particularly if we want to be more representative with size, style, and colors. 
Wait, didn't you just say you did this crowd-source thing before?
Yes! Back in 2017, we raised almost $5,000 to bring in a modest assortment of swim into the shop, and then we cautiously expanded to a few new styles last year as well. However, swimwear remains the single most expensive product we stock, and we received some criticisms about our selection. To truly do swimwear justice, we need the help of our customers. My open cash flow allows me to carry a few styles in select sizes, but if people contribute to the campaign, essentially prepaying for their new swimsuits plus gaining extra perks, we can do so much more for our customers. There are a wealth of styles, colors, sizes, and brands available, and with the last campaign, we were able to dip our toes in the water. This year, I want to dive in headfirst and explore. I want people to have the option of trying on multiple suits in different fits and sizes—to find that perfect confidence boosting piece that makes you feel beautiful and sexy and courageous. Without this campaign, we'll rely primarily on what we currently stock, four pre-booked style, and special orders, meaning you may not be able to leave the shop with a swimsuit on the day you visit. Crowdsourcing allows us to pull resources together to improve the shop for everyone.

How much do you need?
Because we only sell high quality products, the wholesale cost on a bikini top is comparable to the cost of our bras, but a one-piece or a tankini? The added material creates a wholesale cost almost double that of a normal bra. Now factor in over 125 different sizes to represent, and the investment total adds up quickly. The shop has allocated around $3,000 of our spring buying budget to supplement our existing stock and any fundraising results, but we are aiming for an additional $10,000 with the campaign. Aside from factoring in wholesale costs, we also have the following expenses:

$350-400 in estimated shipping costs from manufacturers
$300-350 in estimated storage and fixtures to accommodate the extra inventory
General cost of the perks, including the added store credit and the profit lost through discount coupons for larger contributions
Indiegogo fees totaling 8% of funds raised plus 30 cents per contribution (includes platform and credit card fees)
Indiegogo now withholds 5% of the funds raised for six months to allow for refunds, meaning as much $500 of the goal will not be given to us until after swim season.

While $10,000 is our ultimate goal, I have tiered plans depending on how much we ultimately raise, each revolving around unique swimwear color groups from our brands. Coordinating collections usually consist of two to three top styles plus a few matching bottom options, and we will balance variety both in terms of shape and size but also in color and print.

$2,500: At least two collections
$5,000: At least four collections
$7,500: At least six collections
$10,000: At least eight collections

You'll notice I use ""at least"" in my campaign promises. No, I'm not going all politician on you. Like any retail business, sales fuel growth, and it is my intention for the campaign to essentially jump start our swim expansion. As we continue to sell items in-store, we can funnel the profits into more styles than originally planned, particularly because certain prints and colors do not release until well after the campaign ends. 
How much are swimsuits and what styles are available?
As with bras and lingerie, swim prices vary depending on size, style, and manufacturer. Generally, the more bells and whistles to the design, the higher the retail price. Our store price range will be as follows:

Bikini Tops: $50 to $80
Tankini Tops: $70 to $130
One-Piece Suits: $80 to $150
Matching Bottoms: $25 to $60

We'll focus primarily on bikini and tankini pieces and accompanying bottoms with one-pieces being fund-raising dependent. Sizes range from 28 to 44 bands with cups from B to UK K/US O. Check out a few of the many styles we're considering in the images section of the campaign.
Why should I donate?
We realize this an atypical request of a retail store. Usually, expansion is an internal decision by the business owner, and I personally wavered on the decision to revisit crowd-souring again for the season. However, a small selection disappoints people, and the ones who wait last minute (you know who you are) may be forced to settle on something not quite right for the sake of time. If we took a risk and used credit to expand beyond what cash flow allowed, then we could end up unable to pay vendors or place new orders until sales picked up enough to pay back the investment. I value my vendors and prefer to play it safe rather than mess up relationships I have spent over seven years cultivating. As a result, I thought all of us could work together to make this year a dynamic, exciting year for the Piedmont Triad region by bringing in a big selection of swim everyone can enjoy! 
I also want to stress that contributing to our campaign is risk-free. We have been in business for over seven years and have no plans of closing. What you donate will be made available to you via a downloadable gift certificate good toward any purchase in the store. That's right. You don't even have to spend your donation on swimwear. By paying it forward early, you afford us the opportunity to expand quickly and keep fresh inventory cycling into the shop as the season progresses. Not to mention, we're offering some sweet perks as a way of thanking you for supporting the store:

$25 Contribution: $30 in Store Credit
$50 Contribution: $55 in Store Credit plus 5% off an entire purchase coupon. 
$75 Contribution: $80 in Store Credit plus 5% off an entire purchase coupon.
$100 Contribution: $105 in Store Credit plus 10% off an entire purchase coupon.
$125 Contribution: $130 in Store Credit plus 10% off an entire purchase coupon.
$150 Contribution: $155 in Store Credit plus 10% off an entire purchase coupon.
$175 Contribution: $180 in Store Credit plus 15% off an entire purchase coupon.
$200 Contribution: $205 in store Credit plus 15% off an entire purchase coupon.

Every contribution nets you $5 in bonus store credit, and higher donation amounts gain added discounts on entire purchases, including items other than swim! Furthermore, the donations work in conjunction with our existing customer loyalty program, making the savings greater for early contributions.
When will the swimwear be available in the store?
We currently have existing inventory with planned arrivals for February, March, and May. Additional styles will arrive two to four weeks after the campaign ends. Check out this beautiful style from Panache called Portofino that we currently stock:

If I contribute, does that guarantee my size and the suit of my choice will be in stock?
Unfortunately, no. Our sizing assortment will be based primarily on our best-selling bra sizes and previous swim sales; however, contributors can guarantee their size in a style of their choosing by contacting me directly or leaving a note with their donation. I will personally include these in our orders, but keep in mind some swim pieces have release dates later in the season which may require waiting. If you have any questions about release dates or availability in your size, please email me or call the store. But remember: Your contributions are not limited to swim and can be used to restock your bra wardrobe too!
What if I like your store but am not interested in swimwear?
You can still donate to the swimwear fund because all donations are transferable to store credit. The flip side of the store's contribution to swimwear is that we are essentially funneling most of our intimate apparel expansion money for spring into swim. Consequently, we won't have much left over for adding new bras, shapewear, lingerie, or other intimate apparel until after swim season is over. I planned a few additions to keep the inventory fresh, but without a strong campaign, the shop will not experience the surge of new colors, prints, and styles as in past years. Swim is our expansion, but if we can offset the cost of adding swim to the shop, then our intimate apparel budget will rebound quickly and lead to faster expansion in other avenues. Profit directly supports growth and allows us to become stronger as a business by addressing consumer demands and filling gaps in the marketplace In short, profit is a good thing. 

What if you raise more than $10,000?
I'm not one to count chicks before they hatch or whatever your colloquialism-of-choice is for being overly and possibly naively optimistic about . . . well . . . anything. I was pretty sure the store wasn't going to make it a year, so taking my firmly realistic outlook aside, I do believe the campaign could exceed my high expectations. If we raise more than $10,000, I will poll our contributors about whether they prefer the extra amount be available for swim or for expanding to other inventory. In our recent annual survey, many customers asked for more options in shapewear and lounge clothes.  

I can't contribute now, but I want to help. What can I do?
As a small business owner who operates on a shoestring budget and has had one financial hit after another last year, largely due to my business partner and father's cancer scare, I totally get you may not be able to contribute within the window of our campaign. You know your budget, and as always, this is a judgment free space. That said, if you want to help, do so by encouraging others to contribute:

Share the campaign on social media as often as you can. Our shop has accounts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, and Youtube, and we will be posting updates often to encourage contributions.
Send the campaign to friends and family who could benefit from our goals. Or, let's get real for a sec, send it to the ones who complain every summer when it's time to shop. They will thank you.
Don't forget Indiegogo has easy share tools too, allowing you to email or post directly about the campaign.  

Not to be contrite, but every little bit truly helps and that applies as much to publicity as it does to monetary contributions. The more people aware of what we are trying to accomplish and can help us reach our goals, the better the results for everyone. I've been in this business over seven years now, and no one complains about having too much selection!
A Word of Gratitude

Sign up for our “Passport Series” Perk to take six classes for the price of four. Want to dive even deeper into a wine region or learn how to make Coq au Vin or unique vermouth cocktails?

When we first scouted our location for MUST Wine Loft, we knew we wanted to be near downtown but not directly in the hustle of downtown. We looked at multiple locations, but this one grabbed us immediately. Raymond lives in Old Northeast and Jessica lives in Crescent Heights (after spending four years living in the Old Northeast), so the Old Northeast neighborhood is near and dear to our hearts. We hope to add to the charm we adore by offering an intimate place for our neighbors to relax and enjoy a drink and bite off the beaten path of touristy Beach Drive and the bar bustle of Central Ave. We’ve met many of our neighbors already, who have shared their excitement to have a wine & cheese shop opening nearby, and we look forward to meeting many more of our neighbors and new friends like you at MUST Wine Loft!OTHER WAYS YOU CAN HELPWe know that not everyone has the ability to contribute, and that’s ok! What we do ask is that you share your excitement, our story, our video, and our campaign. Help us spread the word, which will only help spread the MUST love too!

<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>My name is Chelsea and I am an occupational therapist born and raised in Cumberland, Rhode Island. I have been an occupational therapist for eight years now with a variety of experience. Last year, I started a private practice in which we delivered mobile therapy services to the most vulnerable populations in our community, starting in geriatrics and then moving to pediatrics. It has been an absolute privilege utilizing my skill set to serve my local community and provide care during such a difficult time.</p>
<p>In addition to being an OT, I am also a mom of two amazing children. My son was born with complex medical and developmental needs. He has required therapy, nursing, medication and various forms of support since he was 10 days old. It has been through this experience that I have learned more about disabilities than anyone could have ever taught me in an educational setting. It was through his challenges and victories that I had the courage to build programs that directly targeted children just like him. During the pandemic, my son regressed significantly. I looked around for help since he was not able to access any of his therapeutic services. I realized that there were currently no options in our community for this style of care. It was at that time that I knew we had to create a pediatric program. </p>
<p>After successfully building a mobile practice that specialized in complex kiddos, we began to realize that both typical and atypical children have been significantly impacted by the lack of socialization, increased amount of screen time, and in ability to engage with professionals directly. From these observations as well as thorough market analysis, we have decided to create a new pediatric social and play-based clinic to help pull these children out of the pandemic through the effective delivery of skilled occupational, physical and speech therapy services.</p>
<h2>Our mission is simple:</h2>
<p><i>Help typical and atypical children through developmentally appropriate, social and play-based therapeutic services that are accessible, safe and convenient. </i></p>
<p>Pediatric therapeutic clinics require a significant amount of specialized equipment, assessments, technology and expertise. When building our first practice, we were able to start slow, taking only as many patients as we could staff. Our overhead and cashflow grew slowly so that we could maintain the quality of care while offsetting the operational costs. In a brick and mortar style practice, we have to pay for these expenses up front.</p>
<p>In order to provide the level of care stated in our mission, our clinic will require rock walls, specially designed swing rings, crash pads, sensory equipment, zip lines, balls, monkey bars, slides, cargo nets, climbing structures and more. The office will require state of the art technology that will allow parents to view treatment sessions from a device, security systems to maintain the highest levels of safety, and sensory equipment for treatment of complex processing disorders. Our team has joined forces with other clinicians around the country to participate in research studies on various evidence-based programs, bringing the best services possible to our community. Donating to this cause would directly impact the children in our town as well as other neighboring areas.  </p>
</div><div>
<h2>Funding Needs:</h2>
<p>Currently our clinic is being specifically built to meet the unique needs of our children. Lighting, design, privacy and safety have all been taken into consideration in the design. We have been slowly attempting to purchase equipment from our list of necessary items. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><i>Swing rig and swings:</i></strong> vestibular and proprioceptive input are a necessary component to sensory integration therapy, utilized to help treat disorders such as autism, ADHD, developmental coordination disorders, hydrocephalus and more. The swing rig is being custom built to meet the needs of the clinic and will cost $5000. The swings, safety snaps, ropes and height adjustment hooks will cost an additional $3000. This is one of our largest expenses however it is imperative to the effective treatment of so many pediatric conditions.</li>
<li>
<strong><i>Rock wall and monkey bars:</i></strong> children with developmental and physical abilities require strengthening of core, grip and gross motor skills however they need an engaging and confidence building environment. The rock wall is a 15 foot wide x 8 foot tall structure with various holds and obstacles. With assistance, children climb and move transversely through the structure, not only building strength and confidence but decreasing doubt and fear. The heavy input through the joints provides calming sensations to children with otherwise struggle with sensory organization. The rock wall with all hardware, fixtures and safety mats will cost $5000. Monkey bars address a variety of needs including gravitational instability, shoulder and grip strength, and proprioceptive input. This equipment allows children to practice activities seen on a typical playground, in a safe and positive environment. The cost of this structure and safety mats below will cost $2400.</li>
<li>
<strong><i>Assessment tools:</i></strong> in order to provide the highest quality of evidence-based services, our clinicians will utilize standardized assessment tools as well as clinical observations in order to create the most appropriate treatment plans. Assessment tools for occupational, physical and speech therapy services range anywhere from $500 to $1000 each. Each speciality will require multiple tools to address the age range of our target market as well as a variety of developmental needs. </li>
</ul>
<p>These items represent just a small fraction of the expenses. Our startup budget is approximately $40,000. We have been able to save and boot strap approximately $20,000 thus far. We are systematically purchasing and ordering the most necessary equipment in a prioritized manner however in order to provide superb services the day the doors open, we must find a way to raise the remainder of the funds. </p>
</div><div>
<h2>The Impact</h2>
<p>So far, we have been able to reach out into the community and treat the most medically complex and fragile populations of our community. However, children require safe social and play-based experiences for proper development. The pandemic has deprived our community of these opportunities. In addition to providing direct therapy services, our clinic will be providing group based services that will be cheaper than the cost of a co-pay. This will allow more children to be under the watchful eye of a clinical specialist, increasing accessibility. Our groups will include social skills, adapted bootcamps, fine motor, feeding teams, Mommy and Me classes, children's yoga, bike riding and more!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Starting a practice right before the beginning of the pandemic sure made for a wild ride. I found myself having to pivot my entire business model on a dime in order to survive. Although I have confidence in my clinical skills, it is my ability to find opportunity in any situation that has helped our practice survive throughout this first year. The risks and challenges remain plentiful: COVID restrictions, fearful parents, rising costs due to economic uncertainty to name a few. However it is my ultimate belief that this clinic will serve children like my son, who require specialized services to thrive at their fullest potential. The most important key to success of any project is the team and culture behind it. I have been incredibly blessed with the steady loyalty of an amazing group of women who believes in my vision whole-heartedly. Without their dedication, commitment and compassion, our practice would cease to exist. Although there are many challenges, I have incredible faith in our mission, vision and team. </p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

In addition to hosting artists, we plan on offering design classes with a focus on sustainability and opening our homestead to the community at large. Now more than ever, having control of your food, and creating nourishment for your family is vital for health and survival. The food we eat passes through many hands before it hits our tables. We will teach you skills to grow your own food in small space, put it by, and keep you and your family healthy and strong. The ImpactTeaching Self Sufficiency and Mindfulness and Supporting Emerging ArtistsWe love old places and this one deserves a second chance in life. She may have been neglected, but she has good bones and a great foundation. I am originally from West Virginia from an old, mountain family that settled in the region before there was the United States. My ancestors foraged and lived off the land and have a long history of self-sufficient and sustainable living. It’s in my DNA. We want to teach people the best practices for growing the most amount of healthy, organic food in the least amount of space and tried and true methods of putting things by. Also, we will teach classes in sustainable floral design, soap making, and other practical skills. Working with nature creates a state of flow and mindfulness and we want to share that gift. Classes will be made available for day-trippers or people staying in the area. They will be small groups, taught by local experts. Resident artists will be encouraged to show and speak about their work at a local arts center and will be matched with working professionals who will perform 2-3 studio visits during their stay. We want this to be a place to support emerging and mid-career artists and to encourage those who are looking to build a career in creative pursuits. In lieu of payment, artists will donate a piece of their work created during their stay and will be encouraged to show their work and talk about their process to the local community.  It's an excellent opportunity for emerging and mid career artists learn from working professionals and gain more exposure and talk about their work.   This is a lifelong dream of ours and Enrique, Lavender, William I and are very excited about restoring a neglected home, giving back to our community and offering artists a place to sprout their journeys.What We Need & What You Get We need $20K in Funding you get a Great ExperienceWe are seeking $20K. We will use the funds to help supplement the initial down payment and closing costs, establish a 503(c) foundation to offset the maintenance and administrative fees and to develop a book documenting the process. The entire project will be underwritten by Rose Red & Lavender, and the Sevilla Family. You get to be a part of this amazing project and you are investing in this. In exchange for your kindness we are offering the following:  
$5+ Our eternal gratitude
$25 Handmade soap, made with pure ingredients and love by, Kimberly Sevilla
$50 credit in the book as a friend of the project
$100 book documenting the restoration of the Blue House with credit in the book
$250 floral design class with Kimberly Sevilla at Blue House Hudson Valley
$500 weekend stay for 2 in the artist's apartment

$2500 weekend stay for two plus one private workshop and a painting created by an artist in residence
$5000 Private floral design class for 5 at a location of your choice in the NYC metropolitan area and a home or garden evaluation of plant recommendations and advice. 
  The LocationNestled in the Hudson Valley, close enough to New York City, Sanctuary and Spirit of a SalonLocated about an hour and a half north of New York City and walkable to a historic village, this location offers opportunities to be in the country but still accessible to the city. Minutes from the property are miles of hiking trails, preserved open spaces and forests. Nearby are Dia Beacon, Storm King Art Center, Magazzino Italian Art Center, Thomas Cole Hudson River Museum, Historic Hyde Park, The Glynwood Center for Regional Food and Farming, and the Culinary Institute of America.TheHudson Valley is known for its stunning mountainscape beauty, preserved open spaces, organic farms, and a plethora of festivals and arts foundations. We intend to transform this historic farmhouse into a sanctuary and invite artists to a private space where they can create, unwind, and be inspired. While being respectful to its heritage; the finished site will have passive design elements, a fully functioning woodworking studio, a wet studio for pottery, floral design, and soap making along with organic vegetable gardens and perhaps a goat or two and some chickens. The artist’s residence will have an en-suite, private studio, separate bedroom, and a private bath and kitchen. We intend on opening our home and hearth for select guests to relax and unwind and have meaningful conversations and discussions in the spirit of a modern-day salon.  Why Hi, my name is Kimberly Sevilla and I am the owner of Rose Red & Lavender. I founded my business in Williamsburg Brooklyn in 2008 out of a desire to share my love of plants and flowers with my community and to empower people to embrace the natural world by teaching classes in organic gardening and sustainable design. Sadly, the beautiful, old complex that housed my business was torn down in 2018 to build condos.My Family and I are launching a new project. We want to save this C1870's Hudson Valley farmhouse from the bulldozer and will need your help. Here is a little video of me and our little shop made in 2012. I thought I looked old and fat, but that's a different story.  

 
  Risks & ChallengesSomeone else will buy it and tear it down, restoring a historic home ain't easy. This house recently went on the market. We are concerned if we don’t act quickly, that someone else will buy it and tear it down to build a McMansion. This would not only impact the local community where the house is located but would also be a tragedy to have such a beautiful treasure put in a landfill. We are aware of the difficulties of house restoration and intend on using reclaimed materials when possible and following passive design principles while maintaining the historic context and integrity of the property. We also intend on using professional designers, architects and  contractors for the renovations necessary to make it habitable for the artists and our family.   Other Ways You Can HelpShare your expertise and skills, holler from the mountain tops about us.We understand that not everyone can monetarily support us. That’s OK. We are actively seeking artists and curators who would like to contribute their knowledge and expertise as well as artisans who would like to share their skills with a broader community. As you know, people like to support people that they like, if you aren’t the “Artsy” type (as my WV mom would say), sharing our campaign, hollering about us and making some noise about us to your friends and family would go a long way.  About UsWest Virginia Meets Peru (Queens) on the Dance Floor and Creates a  Family and a Floral and Plant Empire Kimberly Sevilla is the founder of Rose Red & Lavender, a well-known floral design company located in the New York metro area.

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>The Collective Yoga Co-op is a group of teachers who believe that the yoga world needs to change. No investment groups. No equity firms. No corporate backing. This is yoga for the people, by the people.</p>
<p>In seeking to establish as a nonprofit workers cooperative, we commit to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pop-up yoga classes throughout Chicago, in support of local nonprofits</li>
<li>A virtual teaching schedule</li>
<li>Centering LGBTQ+ voices and voices of color in our teachers and community</li>
<li>A sliding scale drop-in to make yoga accessible</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>""A cooperative is not a spectator sport."" -Melanie Shellito</p>
<p>We are starting this cooperative because we believe in the power of community. Because we have no interest in the corporate model of yoga, we need capital from you!</p>
<p><u><strong>We set a goal of $30,000 to achieve the following:</strong></u></p>
<ul>
<li>Our goal for this Indiegogo campaign is to open a pop-up studio for at least 3-6 months, with the hope of a permanent space as we continue acquiring capital</li>
<li>Establish ourselves as an official business in the State of Illinois</li>
<li>Legal, registration, trademarking, and filing fees</li>

<h3>What is a cooperative?</h3>
<p>A workers cooperative is a democratic solution to business. Rather than a CEO, equity firm, or investment group making decisions on the direction of the business, the worker-owners (teachers) act as a team, and decisions are made by vote. In the spirit of community and democracy, we want our members to have voting power as well. So when it comes down to things like things like scheduling, special workshops, or how we build and grow the studio, you’d get a hand in the decision-making process as a member!</p>
<p>All cooperatives must stand upon 10 principles, and The Collective Yoga Co-op pledges to uphold them at all times to the best of our abilities: self-help, self-responsibility, democracy, equality, equity, solidarity, honesty, openness, social responsibility, and caring for others</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our two major challenges at the moment are capital and the COVID-19 pandemic. We will not pursue the brick &amp; mortar pop-up until it is safe to do so. We will listen carefully to the advice of the CDC and other medical professionals on when a vaccine is available, and when it is safe to gather indoors again.</p>
<p>While it is a challenge, we also look at is as an opportunity to raise capital while we wait. That's why you can start taking online classes with us immediately, and why we will hold regular outdoor classes for as long as the weather allows.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute dollars, no worries! Reach out via <a href=""mailto:info@thecollectiveyogacoop.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">email</a> and let's chat. The very principle of a co-op is that everyone can be a part of it regardless of financial situation. We may need help with legal advice, networking, raising funds, creative design, and more.</p>

And Las Vegas is home to the ultimate cinematic experience with The 35 Cinema....movies as the way they were meant to be seen.  Unlike our original location we will be FAMILY FRIENDLY!  this means you entire family can enjoy that classic feeling of going to the movies!  The 35 Cinema is the only multiplex theater of its kind in the world. What makes The 35 Cinema so special? It's a retro movie house that presents timeless classics and cult favorites the way they were originally made and shown...with genuine 35 millimeter film and projectors.  There are only a handful of theaters running 35mm film in the US.  But what make The 35 Cinema stand out about all the others is that it's the only 100% revival theater in the world running exclusively on 100% film!  We will not be playing anything after the year 2000.Today's modern megaplexes utilize a totally digital format, essentially transforming their screens into over-sized televisions. Computers and electronic devices generate sound and imagery that are often called ""hyper-realistic"". While the goal of this technology is a perfect presentation, what's lacking, however is charm, warmth, and the intimacy of an old-time cinema.The 35 Cinema restores the original format of movies, once thought to be lost forever. Let the sounds and flickering of 35mm projectors whisk you away on an unforgettable adventure. Classics like The Wizard of Oz, Singing In The Rain, Alien, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Shining, Star Wars, Tron, A Nightmare On Elm Street...all of them were created using movie film, and nothing can replace the thrill of watching them that way.Please note: The above video is not ours.  But it gives you a full idea of the workings of a 35mm projector.At The 35 Cinema, our meticulously-restored systems are a part of the show. Projectors are located within view of the auditorium, not hidden out of sight.   Arrive early to watch our projectionist thread your movie through complex gears and pulleys, into a powerful lamp housing and onto massive take-up reels. Grab an ice-cold soft drink and a bag of the best popcorn in town, then settle in for vintage coming-attraction trailers before the landmark main featurePhoto from our original locationAlong with being the coolest retro theater in the world, The 35 Cinema is the ultimate gathering spot for cine-philes of all ages. We offer an ever-expanding schedule of fan events, celebrity appearances, themed festivals and all-day marathons. Rare props, movie memorabilia, and dozens of autographed photos take you back to when you first saw your favorites on the silver screen.Photo from our original locationOne of the many events we'll be hosting will be our ""Breakfast with the Toons"" every Saturday and Sunday morning.  Where you'll be served a continental breakfast and get to watch two to three cartoon shorts before an animated feature!  The fun part about it is it'll be just like when you were a kid watching cartoons Saturday morning...

<h3>Project Summary</h3>
<p>Contributors who fund Twin Cakes of Michigan are helping them add a refrigerated portable display case and related support items.</p>
<p>Twin Cakes started on a farm in Caledonia, Michigan when the twins were very young and now they are seeking to expand their offerings at the farmers market. </p>
<p>This expansion need presented itself after a few years of offering pre-packaged selections as well as singles at the Calendonioa Farmers' Market.</p>
<p>This expansion allows them to support their customers' emerging needs.</p>
<p>We hope you will consider a donation to get this project fully funded.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Here is a breakdown of the reasoning for the expansion and adding of new equipment:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are seeking a refrigerated case that will enable us to showcase more of the products we are creating.</li>
<li>We have some yummy perks that are all distributed at the Calendonia Farmers' Market. </li>
<li>If we do not reach our goal on here, we will resort to other crowdsourcing activities like increasing our direct sales of cakes and other baked goods to entice folks to donate. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>It is exciting to see the positive impact of Twin Cakes successfully running a small business in the food industry. Since the twins have been raised on a small Michigan farm, the importance of homemade has not been lost on them over the years. </p>
<p>Most people who have ordered their cupcakes, which since day one has included gluten-free options as well as traditional, are very excited by their expansion.</p>
<p>The new case will enable them to add more purchasing options from their customers who are asking for more options when selecting their 4-packs or 6-packs of cupcakes.</p>
<p>People love choices and the twins are seeking to deliver what the customers are craving as they maximize their offerings via this new refrigerated unit.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>If Twin Cakes is not funded they run the risk of not advancing their business as they will have to return to the old method, which does not allow for customization of boxed items. It also runs the risk of halting their growth at a time when folks are just starting to venture out after a long 15 months of COVID-19 restrictions. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Even if you cannot donate, we invite you to visit Twin Cakes at the Caledonia Farmers' Market this summer. Or if that is too far, please join our mailing list to be kept in the loop as you can celebrate our joy in growing a business from scatch, which is just like the cakes we make.</p>

<p>The idea of starting this charity was born in 1995 by British and Swedish born circus performers, Mr, Mrs Eddie &amp; Charlotte Haworth when they were running their UK circus skill training workshops for disadvantaged kids in Liverpool, England.</p>
<p>In the year 2000, Eddie was invited to perform at a charity event held at the British Embassy in Bangkok, Thailand.  Following that performance and a few more for the slum kids in Bangkok, it was quickly decided to bring more gifts of laughter and educational entertainment to orphans and other children in Thailand.</p>
<p>Now supported by a team of dedicated volunteers, Gift of
Happiness Foundation is not tied to supporting just a few children at only one
location. Therefore, this unique charity has the freedom to provide joy to
thousands of children in urban and remote locations throughout the country.</p>
<p><b>Absolute dedication from everyone at this small but effective charity.</b></p>
<p>The Founder/Director, administrators, drivers and all other volunteers DO NOT get paid one cent at Gift of Happiness Foundation. We are all early retired or employed elsewhere but have enough time to volunteer our services to help some of the neediest people in this country every month of every year. <br/></p>
<p><b>What we actually do.</b></p>
<p>The Foundation regularly gives simple interactive and
educational comedy shows to those whose lives quite often contain little joy.
We also give away tons of essential goods during our monthly aid giving projects. All this is delivered where it's needed most in hired trucks and the Directors own vehicle. </p>
<p><b>Who we help.</b></p>
<p>Orphans, vulnerable street children, Bangkok slum
dwellers, families living on garbage dumps, AIDS centres and facilities housing
physically or mentally challenged children. We regularly serve medical centres,
crisis centres for abused women, communities of migrant worker families and
people displaced by civil war who live in refugee camps.</p>
<p><b>What we actually
give.</b></p>
<p>The charity gives children and their family’s basic
necessities like clothing, bedding, medical supplies, educational equipment, toys,
agricultural tools and tons more useful goods. The children always get to see a
top class professional comedy show to leave them with a fantastic memory that
no-one can ever steel from them!</p>

<p>When I came to Ecuador for the first time, about a year ago, I got surprised by food and agriculture there.

<div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
</div>
<div>The money raised by crowdfunding will be spent on creating a small-scale farm nearby Quito. What we need to have to make this farm reality, is:</div>
<div>- Fertile land, not much further as an hour from Quito, which we focus on for selling our products.  On this land, we will create various ecosystems, like an agro-forestry part and a pond with a swamp, to create the ideal growing conditions for all species. The creation of ecosystems takes time but once established will be very beneficial for our farm and surroundings.   </div>
<div>- A greenhouse which will contain a plant nursery - which we can build ourselves. We have already build several and they perform well. </div>
<div>- Facilities to store and process our harvest - A low-cost farm building, simple, from materials in the area, like wood and clay. </div>
<div>- Several tools, like hoes and shovels. A tractor is a dream for later.</div>
<div>- A small trailer to transport our produce to several markets and stores in Quito.</div>
<div>What you will get depends on your wishes. If you happen to be in Ecuador, we would like to support your contribution by providing food, lodging and a place for volunteering on our project. If you do not happen to be in Ecuador, like the majority, we send hand-made fabric bags with our logo on it, filled with our folders, delicious organic Ecuadorian products, like chocolate, coffee and quinoa to your doorstep.. Or you can pick it up on Stadsboerderij Ceatshage in Culemborg or De Hoge Born in Wageningen, Netherlands.  </div>
</div><div>
<ul> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p></p>
<p>For us as a family the Impact will be very great. We will live on our farm and start a new life together. We are looking forward to that moment!</p>
<p>For the community around us this project will be beneficial too. By sharing seeds and knowledge about agriculture, by opening up a market for fresh local products from farms around us and by opening up the farm to visitors and volunteers which will benefit the local stores and local tourist branche. </p>
<p>The contributor will trigger a sustainable green revolution in Ecuador, based on local produce and open-source seed and knowledge sharing, making the area more 'edible', educative and attractive for visitors and volunteers. These people will stimulate local economy and hopefully spread seeds and knowledge further. </p>My succesful track record in creating projects started on his 4-year study in Biodynamic Agriculture, in the Netherlands. With some classmates I grew a purple, sprouting variety of broccoli. In those days, this vegetable was not well-known on organic markets in the Netherlands. The little bundles of purple sprouts were welcomed with much enthusiasm by the customers. They could have grown much more. For the marketmen, this new product was a welcome complement to their existing assortiment. It attracted more attention to their stand. </div><div>We hope for the same enthusiasm when we introduce vegetables like snappy asian and curly salads,  tiger and zebra tomatoes, french long radish, rainbow chards, Chioggia red beets, shallots, Thai and purple basilic and indigeneous types of corn, potatoes, quinoa, amaranth and beans.  </div><div>Gabriela's succesful track record in projects and interest in nature and food started with researching on the behaviour of monkeys in the Amazone, to researching nutritional aspects of a highland Andean community, volunteering in permacultural projects and later with the birth of our daughter.

With my former education, I learned how to make one for farm-scale. We will only make the most necessary investments first and when 'things start rolling' invest more to reach more people. </p>
<p>Another risk will be that we can not get access to a small piece of good land. This seems rather unlikely, because there is a lot of land available in Ecuador. Though, if we don't find our own piece of land, we will start on an existing farm and do the same. </p> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>If you can't contribute for the perks, a single dollar or euro would be really appreciated to!

We know skating is a passion for so many of them, but we want to offer them more. Our heart is to guide students into finding their passions in life, offer them a safe place to discover what those passions are, and give them the stepping stones to follow them. </p>
<p></p>
<h3>NOT JUST A SKATE PARK...</h3>
<div>The skate park is just the beginning.  We want students to find their place<span style=""font-size: 24px; line-height: 30px;""><b> </b></span>in our community and in their future.    We want to guide them in finding, and acting out their visions and passions.  We plan on helping in the entry process of college, technical school, or the work field. We look forward to implementing classes, such as cooking and  financial, classes to prepare them for life after high school.  We will be available to assist with school work in the form of tutorials.  We'd like to be equipped with the technology students need to complete their school work and projects.  </div>
<div>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>We know we are taking huge risks.  The reputation of city skate parks are not always pretty.  Vandalism, loitering, fighting, alcohol and drug use seem to be reoccurring issues for many parks.  This is why it's important that the skaters are involved in the creativity of the park.  This is also why it's important that we have an indoor facility; in order to build a supportive, trusting community with the youth, and provide opportunities an outdoor park may not provide.  We will encourage them to lead fund raising efforts, skate lessons, and creating other skating related activities such as skate competitions. If they have ownership, these risks will be replaced with pride and ownership in the facility. </div>

</div><b>The Food Forest Project: Our History, Mission, &amp; Goals</b><br/><br/>The Food Forest Project began a few years back, as a hopeful seed in our hearts...and now it has grown literal roots into Mother Earth! We are encouraged to see such progress and promise as our dream becomes reality, for the well-being of all Life. It all began with monthly camping trips to the woods along the Etowah River (near Dahlonega, Georgia). These fantastic retreats filled our proverbial cups with good fellowship, fun, and the restorative healing presence of Nature. We found plenty of creative projects to keep us and the kids active...blazing new trails, swimming, new camping areas, campfire music-making, and building a zipline across the river. <br/><br/>Our group however, was looking for purpose as well as fun. To fulfill our deeper desire, we wanted a way to help people, animals, and the environment. We commonly shared a vision to bring the beauty, bounty, and blessings of Nature to those in need. So we turned our sights to sustainable,<b> </b><a href=""http://www.neverendingfood.org/b-what-is-permaculture/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">permaculture farming</a>...growing earth-healthy food for local charities, churches, and wildlife centers. After a gracious 5-acre donation from the land owners in 2014, we began planning and gathering donations, tools, materials, and knowledge. <br/><br/>Last year, with the generous help of our supporters, we prepped our 5-acre plot with an irrigation <a href=""http://permaculturenews.org/2012/05/16/swales-the-permaculture-element-that-really-holds-water/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">swale</a>, to evenly disperse rain water to the Food Forest. We planted 20 young fruit trees (apple, peach, pear, and plum), a variety of berry bushes, leafy greens, and herbs. We added fencing to deter wildlife, and solar-power irrigation to draw water directly from the river. We now better understand the investments of time and resources that are needed to keep our Food Forest growing and able to fulfill it's purpose.<br/><br/>We are expanding the Food Forest this October with many new, mature fruit trees, as well as other projects that bring us closer to providing a solution to food-scarcity in our community. During harvest time, our supporters will be invited to participate in a <b>50/50 U-Pick</b>, with half going to those in need. We will be partnering with local food banks, charities, and churches to insure that all the healthy food we've grown goes to use! Down the road when our project is in full swing, we plan to offer classes about natural remedies, healthy cooking, sustainability, and Earth-stewardship.<br/><br/><b>We're hoping to fund two projects THIS year....</b><br/><br/><b>1 -</b> This coming October, we hope to purchase and plant 20 mature fruit trees. Although a bit more expensive, the mature trees come with a LIFETIME guarantee. This will increase our odds of success and help us produce food faster. <br/><br/><b>2 -</b> We'd like to lay down a raised <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cob_%28material%29"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Cob floor</a> in the barn. The barn is our main area for shelter, storage, teaching, harvesting, etc. Currently the floor is an undulating mix of red clay, dust, and weeds.

</div></div>","The Food Forest Project: Our History, Mission, & GoalsThe Food Forest Project began a few years back, as a hopeful seed in our hearts...and now it has grown literal roots into Mother Earth! We are encouraged to see such progress and promise as our dream becomes reality, for the well-being of all Life. It all began with monthly camping trips to the woods along the Etowah River (near Dahlonega, Georgia). These fantastic retreats filled our proverbial cups with good fellowship, fun, and the restorative healing presence of Nature. We found plenty of creative projects to keep us and the kids active...blazing new trails, swimming, new camping areas, campfire music-making, and building a zipline across the river. Our group however, was looking for purpose as well as fun. To fulfill our deeper desire, we wanted a way to help people, animals, and the environment. We commonly shared a vision to bring the beauty, bounty, and blessings of Nature to those in need. So we turned our sights to sustainable, permaculture farming...growing earth-healthy food for local charities, churches, and wildlife centers. After a gracious 5-acre donation from the land owners in 2014, we began planning and gathering donations, tools, materials, and knowledge. Last year, with the generous help of our supporters, we prepped our 5-acre plot with an irrigation swale, to evenly disperse rain water to the Food Forest. We planted 20 young fruit trees (apple, peach, pear, and plum), a variety of berry bushes, leafy greens, and herbs. We added fencing to deter wildlife, and solar-power irrigation to draw water directly from the river. We now better understand the investments of time and resources that are needed to keep our Food Forest growing and able to fulfill it's purpose.We are expanding the Food Forest this October with many new, mature fruit trees, as well as other projects that bring us closer to providing a solution to food-scarcity in our community. During harvest time, our supporters will be invited to participate in a 50/50 U-Pick, with half going to those in need. We will be partnering with local food banks, charities, and churches to insure that all the healthy food we've grown goes to use! Down the road when our project is in full swing, we plan to offer classes about natural remedies, healthy cooking, sustainability, and Earth-stewardship.We're hoping to fund two projects THIS year....1 - This coming October, we hope to purchase and plant 20 mature fruit trees. Although a bit more expensive, the mature trees come with a LIFETIME guarantee. This will increase our odds of success and help us produce food faster. 2 - We'd like to lay down a raised Cob floor in the barn. The barn is our main area for shelter, storage, teaching, harvesting, etc. Currently the floor is an undulating mix of red clay, dust, and weeds. We occasionally get water in the barn during a major rain event. Raising the level and putting in a cob floor will solve this and greatly improve the usefulness of the structure. Cob is a resilient mix of sand, clay, and straw that dries hard, like cement. This project will greatly increase the usefulness of the building and teach us more about building with cob, which we plan to use for other storage and shelter areas on the land. Our test batches of cob have turned out well and shown its usefulness. This year we are hoping to raise $2500 to purchase mulch for the garden, 20 mature fruit trees, materials for the Cob floor, equipment rentals, and associated ground materials. If we don’t reach our goal, we'll purchase as much as we can with what we have. Would you like to be a part of our project? Please consider a donation to the Food Forest Project.

 praying mother who never lost faith, I headed back unto the right path.
 I enrolled into Miami Dade College, to study for a better life and 
career. After receiving my associate degree in Psychology, six months 
later after working as an assistant, I was laid off at my job due to the

<p>We are the
Enactus Seneca team. Our mission is to enable progress through
entrepreneurial action. ENACTUS is a global organization that connects
students, academics and business leaders through entrepreneurial-based projects
that empower communities to transform opportunities in to real sustainable
projects.</p>
<p>Our first
international project will be taking place in Cambodia. Since the beginning of
our startup we have known that this country is facing several severe inhuman
issues. Therefore, we decided to use our expertise and experience to give
families and children the ability to feel like humans again. Our main goal is
to reach <b>$5000 CAD</b> in the next two
weeks. This money will be used to finance Threads of Empowerment Project. </p>

Three years ago, a shy seven year old Cambodian
girl who had never been to school, Nita was excited when her Aunt Sophy brought
her to live in the big city. Sophy enrolled her in a private school, spending
sixty dollars a month to give her niece a decent chance. It was hard. Nita was
three years behind grade level and had no study skills. She had to repeat the
first grade, but she worked hard and succeeded in the second try. Now, having
almost completed the second grade, Nita has had to withdraw from school on
March 23<sup>rd</sup> because her aunt can no longer afford the tuition. She
wept when her Aunt Sophy broke the news. Without funding, she will have to live
in the village where there is no education. This girl has come so far in three

“Threads
of Empowerment” Cambodia
We are the
Enactus Seneca team. Our mission is to enable progress through
entrepreneurial action. ENACTUS is a global organization that connects
students, academics and business leaders through entrepreneurial-based projects
that empower communities to transform opportunities in to real sustainable
projects.
Our first
international project will be taking place in Cambodia. Since the beginning of
our startup we have known that this country is facing several severe inhuman
issues. Therefore, we decided to use our expertise and experience to give
families and children the ability to feel like humans again. Our main goal is
to reach $5000 CAD in the next two
weeks. This money will be used to finance Threads of Empowerment Project. 

Three years ago, a shy seven year old Cambodian
girl who had never been to school, Nita was excited when her Aunt Sophy brought
her to live in the big city. Sophy enrolled her in a private school, spending
sixty dollars a month to give her niece a decent chance. It was hard. Nita was
three years behind grade level and had no study skills. She had to repeat the
first grade, but she worked hard and succeeded in the second try. Now, having
almost completed the second grade, Nita has had to withdraw from school on
March 23rd because her aunt can no longer afford the tuition. She
wept when her Aunt Sophy broke the news. Without funding, she will have to live
in the village where there is no education. This girl has come so far in three
years. With our help, Nita’s extended family can start a business and support
her education and that of her younger sister, Nikka. 
In the month of May 2015, three of our
team members will be traveling to Cambodia to begin teaching Cambodians
entrepreneurial skills, and the clothes we’ve collected will provide a better
source of income instead of, in some circumstances, sending their children into
brothels. Kristen Scharf, our main project leader, has been volunteering

(Chef Carlos Chombolin Alba doing chicharrones)
We are a group of young dreamers from Panama in Central America. We have seen the potential of growth in our country. We are gastro-addicts that have discovered our rainforest an opportunity. We believe in our customs, traditions, resources and produce. We are in search to define locality and food that encounters produce cooked with techniques that tell a story of our region. We acknowledge that is kind of an stretch to ask the world to trust in us but we kind of feel that food is a form of global art.Introducing first FIGHTING out of the blue corner with experience as head chef at Atelier and Humo in Panama City, having worked with Chef Mario Castrellon of Maito and Chef Mikel Gallo of Ni Neu in San Sebastián, Spain... It is Chef Carlos ""Chombolin"" Alba. And now FIGHTING out the red corner with a record of 100 drinks in 7 minutes, the most awesome hair in the country and expert craftsman in drinks, fighting out of Hotel Chantelle NYC... Robert A. Martin.  OUR PLEDGE

(Locally sourced pixbae)What we are going to do is discover what our country and region has to give to the world in terms of fruits, new flavors, old cooking techniques and preparation. To develop a cuisine around the history of the biodiversity that involves Panama´s emerging from the sea. Panama little country in the middle of the continent since we have been a region of transit, we have some mad flavors and cooking styles  that we want to show the world.In order to challenge ourselves we pledge to cook with 90% local product. We will be working directly with farmers and give them a fair price eliminating the intermediaries also guarding endemic product from this land. WHERE IS THE FUNDING GOING TOWARDS

<b><h3>Our Purpose: To Connect People with Great Local and Online Black Owned Businesses</h3></b><div>
<p>
BlkTown was founded in 2014 to help people find great local and online 
black owned/co-owned businesses like restaurants, contractors, clothing designers
 and hair care products.  You can use BlkTown to find awesome black 
owned/co-owned local and online businesses, network with other like minded individuals and discuss
 important topics in the BlkTown Forums.</p>
<p></p>
<div>
<b><b><h3>The Facts<br/>
</h3></b></b><div>43 million African Americans in the United States, 13.7 percent of the 
total population, the second largest racial minority in the country.<br/><br/>With an estimated $1.1 trillion in buying power by 2015 and $1.3 trillion by 2017.<br/><br/>So what does this all mean in business terms?<br/>It means African Americans wield tremendous economic power.<br/><br/><b><b><h3>The Problem<br/>
</h3></b></b>With
 over 2 million registered black owned businesses in the United States 
the NAACP says “Currently, a dollar circulates in Asian communities for a
 month, in 
Jewish communities approximately 20 days and white communities 17 days. 
How long does a dollar circulate in the black community? 6 hours!!! 
African American buying power is at 1.1 Trillion; and yet only 2 cents 
of every dollar an African American spends in this country goes to black
 owned businesses.”<br/><br/>13-percent of the U.S. population, just seven-percent (7%) of small 
business are owned by Blacks. Access to capital, clientele, and other 
resources hinder many Black folks from starting business, despite our 
long history of entrepreneurship.<br/><br/><b><h3>The Solution</h3></b><b></b><div>Welcome to BlkTown.com where we provide a means of connecting people with awesome black 
owned/co-owned local location based and online businesses.<div>BlkTown

BlkTown was founded in 2014 to help people find great local and online 
black owned/co-owned businesses like restaurants, contractors, clothing designers
 and hair care products.  You can use BlkTown to find awesome black 
owned/co-owned local and online businesses, network with other like minded individuals and discuss
 important topics in the BlkTown Forums.


The Facts
43 million African Americans in the United States, 13.7 percent of the 
total population, the second largest racial minority in the country.With an estimated $1.1 trillion in buying power by 2015 and $1.3 trillion by 2017.So what does this all mean in business terms?It means African Americans wield tremendous economic power.The Problem
With
 over 2 million registered black owned businesses in the United States 
the NAACP says “Currently, a dollar circulates in Asian communities for a
 month, in 
Jewish communities approximately 20 days and white communities 17 days. 
How long does a dollar circulate in the black community? 6 hours!!! 
African American buying power is at 1.1 Trillion; and yet only 2 cents 
of every dollar an African American spends in this country goes to black
 owned businesses.”13-percent of the U.S. population, just seven-percent (7%) of small 
business are owned by Blacks. Access to capital, clientele, and other 
resources hinder many Black folks from starting business, despite our 
long history of entrepreneurship.The SolutionWelcome to BlkTown.com where we provide a means of connecting people with awesome black 
owned/co-owned local location based and online businesses.BlkTown 
focuses on Rebuilding, Encouraging and Empowering Black Owned/Co-Owned 
Businesses, Entrepreneurs and CEOs through our interactive and user 
friendly web and mobile platforms.Check it out today and support our Black Owned/Co-Owned businesses.  






What We Need & What You Get So how does your contribution help us:  Not a single dollar will be paid to anyone at BlkTown as every dollar we receive will be used for marketing via our social platforms on facebook, twitter, instagram, pinterest, etc. managed by persons of color.
    
The Impact Your contribution greatly helps us spread the word about BlkTown, to encourage other Black Owned Businesses to promote and share their products/services with our community.

<p>The Gypsies Trunk started as an Etsy store in 2012, selling handmade bohemian jewelry as well as vintage clothing &amp; accessories. We have now proudly grown into our own online store, which launched May of 2014. The pieces that we carry are tribal inspired, for example, beautiful fair-trade bags from Thailand &amp; Morocco. We will also be selling handmade items from independent, local artists in our physical store, such as jewelry, clothes, soaps etc. <br/></p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>The dream of shop owner Katie Acampora is to have a boutique here in San Diego to sell beautiful 
things that inspire women to travel, be simple, be free, and to find 
their own unique style. The items in the shop are ethnic, bohemian, 
beachy and easy to love. Each piece should make your soul happy! <br/></p>
<p>We would be forever grateful for each and every donation, big or small! You will be helping us achieve our dream of a life time, bringing The Gypsies Trunk to life!  </p>

<p>We are offering discounts and free stuff to our amazingly kind contributors! Promo codes to our website and free jewelry! <br/></p>

If you have a project or you are a developer need support for building a prototype, prepare for a short inquiry for your project to get to the list.

<div>
<h2><b>OSWF - Mission</b></h2>
<p>As the maker
movement gets where it is right now, and Open Source especially in hardware is
spreading like never before. We, the community, will need to make sure to
support the Open Source developer and projects. And we need to make a change now. Enable access for two third of humanity to the open-sorce world by spreading the maker-movement to developing countries<br/><br/></p>
<h3><br/></h3>
<h2><b>The OSWF Support Fund</b></h2>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">The OSWF will be
a non-profit oriented organization that will support the Open Source Movement
to get a sustainable financial support and spread to developing countries.</span><br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2><b><span>OSWF Platform</span></b></h2>
<ul>
<li>Good Company, bad company directory</li>
<li>Project directory </li>
<li>Developer directory</li>
<li>Discussion Groups / Community directory</li>
<li>Community Features (feedback, rating, voting,
     surveys)</li>
<li>Support Fund (projects and developing)</li>
<li>Open Source Energy movement repository</li>
<li>Offline project repository for developing
     countries</li>
</ul>
<span>Supporting Open Source
developer to benefit while companies make profit with Open Source is the way it
goes anyway and it’s good<br/>
But with a little change in the management driven by us, the whole world wide
community, it would change everything.<br/>
</span><br/>
</div><div>
<h2>More?</h2>
<p>One more
thing we are going to do is doing some projects of our own like we would at
first spread the Open Source Maker Movement to Uganda by supporting our
partner, a registered non-profit self-learning institute to build up a solar
system, a school house and a workshop. And start spreading the idea of our Open
Source Energy Movement we initialized some days ago.<br/>
So we will try to build up a sustainable eco-cycle for open-source support and
development but also community projects to enable self-education as access to
tools and knowledge. Everything Open Source.</p>
<p>If it gets
even more money as needed to give away a lot of them we also will save some
money to support other projects on the platform in future and by user voting’s
and design competitions.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h2><b>Perks</b></h2>
<p><b>- Every supporter of this campaign </b>will get a digital <b>co-founder badge</b> on his profile on our project platform and will get beta access to the platform. Of course we will have a <b>web page listing all supporters</b> .</p>
<p><br/></p>
<br/>
<h2>Funding Target(s)</h2>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">
</span></p>
<p>
10.000,- EUR would help us to set our Development Ninja free from his student job for
one year while developing the platform we need and more features we will add.
</p>
<p>
2.500,- EUR will cover some costs we would have for hosting and setting up a legal
registered Foundation which is called “Genossenschaft” in Germany to make sure
everything is legal and official. As we will need some money compensating the
time we take free but need to pay for a living trying to realize this idea.</p>
<p></p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">4.500,- EUR will be the indiegogo provision</span><br/></p>
<p>The rest will get to the support fund which also will pay for the board production and shipping.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h2>If we don't hit the target</h2>
<p>We will try do it anyway and have very concrete plans on the extended goals as we work on that almost over 6 month right now, but without your support it will take like forever to get this running and not to mention to get people donating money for supporting those projects will take another forever.</p>
<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">While we
targeted at 50.000,- EUR we also decided to make it a flexible campaign. We will
build up the Foundation anyway but every EUR will help to do that and also help
us start supporting as soon as possible.</span><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>If we do
not hit the funding goal but have collected some money we will decide depending
on the money you are willing to support what to do with it first, while we
guarantee that your supported money will get to one or more Open Source
projects.</p>

support the Open Source developer and projects. And we need to make a change now. Enable access for two third of humanity to the open-sorce world by spreading the maker-movement to developing countries

The OSWF Support Fund
The OSWF will be
a non-profit oriented organization that will support the Open Source Movement
to get a sustainable financial support and spread to developing countries.

OSWF Platform

Good Company, bad company directory
Project directory 
Developer directory
Discussion Groups / Community directory
Community Features (feedback, rating, voting,
     surveys)
Support Fund (projects and developing)
Open Source Energy movement repository
Offline project repository for developing
     countries

Supporting Open Source
developer to benefit while companies make profit with Open Source is the way it
goes anyway and it’s good
But with a little change in the management driven by us, the whole world wide
community, it would change everything.


More?
One more
thing we are going to do is doing some projects of our own like we would at
first spread the Open Source Maker Movement to Uganda by supporting our
partner, a registered non-profit self-learning institute to build up a solar
system, a school house and a workshop. And start spreading the idea of our Open
Source Energy Movement we initialized some days ago.
So we will try to build up a sustainable eco-cycle for open-source support and
development but also community projects to enable self-education as access to
tools and knowledge. Everything Open Source.
If it gets
even more money as needed to give away a lot of them we also will save some
money to support other projects on the platform in future and by user voting’s
and design competitions.


Perks
- Every supporter of this campaign will get a digital co-founder badge on his profile on our project platform and will get beta access to the platform. Of course we will have a web page listing all supporters .


Funding Target(s)



10.000,- EUR would help us to set our Development Ninja free from his student job for
one year while developing the platform we need and more features we will add.


2.500,- EUR will cover some costs we would have for hosting and setting up a legal
registered Foundation which is called “Genossenschaft” in Germany to make sure
everything is legal and official. As we will need some money compensating the
time we take free but need to pay for a living trying to realize this idea.

4.500,- EUR will be the indiegogo provision
The rest will get to the support fund which also will pay for the board production and shipping.


If we don't hit the target
We will try do it anyway and have very concrete plans on the extended goals as we work on that almost over 6 month right now, but without your support it will take like forever to get this running and not to mention to get people donating money for supporting those projects will take another forever.
While we
targeted at 50.000,- EUR we also decided to make it a flexible campaign. We will
build up the Foundation anyway but every EUR will help to do that and also help
us start supporting as soon as possible.

If we do
not hit the funding goal but have collected some money we will decide depending
on the money you are willing to support what to do with it first, while we
guarantee that your supported money will get to one or more Open Source
projects.

Currently only a few

survive the Fire of 1894, which devastated most of Main Street.
The cost will be approximately $18,000, some of which I hope to raise 
through the business, but the total is completely beyond what the 
business can support.    The Impact  Books N Things has been one of the few constants in Norway's Downtown, which 
has slowly become more of a destination for shoppers, with a revitalized
 center. It's a privately owned business, with new and used books, 
newspapers, magazines, greeting cards, and quality toys. We're members 
of the American Bookseller's Association. Your contribution will be supporting our 'buy-local' economy, with an emphasis on supporting local independent businesses, and the strong sense of community that we generate.

<h3>Why Guatemalan mothers need your help?</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Guatemala struggles with <b>exceptionally high levels of inequality and poverty</b>. The fertility rate of 3.8 children per woman (4.6 in indigenous communities) is the highest in Latin America and the Caribbean. 75% of the indigenous population lives in poverty, which means they survive on less than $2 a day. </p>

<p></p>
<p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Maternal and infant death, teenage pregnancy, chronic malnutrition and gender inequality rates in Guatemala are extremely alarming and among the highest in the world. </span><br/></p>
</div><div>Even though Guatemalan women report their<b> ideal number of children to be 2 and many wish to delay or space their pregnancies</b>, poor access to health services and information means they<b> have more children than they can provide for</b>, are unable to finish primary school, and face serious health risks. <b>You can help us change this!</b>

</div></div>","Update: YOU DID IT! 

We are absolutely thrilled to share this very exciting news with you: we have reached our goal and raised the funds needed to open our 1st stationary clinic in Guatemala!

Thanks to the generosity of 70 contributors to our Indiegogo campaign, numerous mail donations we received and hundreds of social media shares, we raised over $35,000, which was matched by one of our long-time donors. We look forward to seeing you in Antigua so you can see for yourself the impact your support has made! Thank you. We couldn't have done it without you!Your support will change lives.

Why Guatemalan mothers need your help?

Guatemala struggles with exceptionally high levels of inequality and poverty. The fertility rate of 3.8 children per woman (4.6 in indigenous communities) is the highest in Latin America and the Caribbean. 75% of the indigenous population lives in poverty, which means they survive on less than $2 a day. 






Maternal and infant death, teenage pregnancy, chronic malnutrition and gender inequality rates in Guatemala are extremely alarming and among the highest in the world. 
Even though Guatemalan women report their ideal number of children to be 2 and many wish to delay or space their pregnancies, poor access to health services and information means they have more children than they can provide for, are unable to finish primary school, and face serious health risks. You can help us change this!

Our work

Since 2001, WINGS has worked directly with marginalized and indigenous communities, offering mobile clinics and providing reproductive health education and services, to give women the tools they need to have control of their lives and to make conscience decisions about their future. 

 


We are now raising funds to establish our first permanent clinic in Antigua Guatemala, which will offer family planning information, contraceptive methods, and cervical cancer screening and treatment.
Make a contribution in the name of a special mother you'd like to honor and help us build the clinic to change Guatemalan mother's lives!

   Double your impact! 
Help 2x as many mothers with a single donation!





We are very excited to share this incredibly generous offer from one of our long-time donors: every donation you make will be matched up to the amount of $35,000! This means that no matter what contribution you make, your impact will be doubled! 
Check the ""Perks"" section to see the difference your contribution will make.




The Impact
We're expecting to provide a total of 1,436 patients with a variety of services in the first year of the operation of the stationary clinic in Antigua.




    Visit us in Guatemala and meet the mothers whose lives you're changing!


Independently of the amount of contribution you make, we are inviting you to visit our clinic in Guatemala and see the impact you're making for yourself!
For those donate who $1,000 or more, we would like to take you on a trip to Sololá to meet our voluntary promoters and learn about their work in the communities.

<p><b>OUR SOURDOUGH CULTURE                                                                                     </b>Our sourdough culture was created just over a year ago, in the bush of Wentworth Falls, Blue Mountains. For three days the freshly milled rye mixed with local Leura spring water sat to ferment under the Eucalyptus trees picking up the unique nuances of our native bush land and, most importantly, its life giving yeasts.

<h4><strong>WHO WE ARE &amp; PAST PROJECTS</strong></h4>
<p>Rebecca is a chef with a variety of experience. As head chef of popular
Sydney cafe <i>Revolver </i>(2009 - 2012) Rebecca was struck by the sense of
confusion that her customers, and the wider public, felt in relation to food
and health. Leaving the cafe Rebecca studied naturopathy and nutrition and in
doing so discovered her passion for using food to heal our bodies, connect us
to the larger ecology of nature, and encourage mindfulness in how we consume. With Frank, she designed the unique and memorable menus at their Surry
Hills pop-up <i>Naked Indiana, </i>with it’s emphasis on raw-food, and <i>Little
Indi</i>, the closed system cafe in Alexandria. Rebecca cooks from the heart,
and her enthusiasm, commitment and playfulness manifest in her creations.</p>

<p>Frank is a fine-artist and industrial/product designer. He has a depth
of experience in hospitality as a barista, bartender, chef and cafe’ owner.
Frank approaches food, drink, coffee and service with the unique passion and
insight of an artist. He is always creating. His innovative approach to all
things is balanced by an appreciation of tradition - especially that of his
Italian ancestors and their approach to food. The previous manifestations of <i>Native
Indiana </i>have embodied Frank’s journey as an artist in their construction -
seeking to relate with kindness and integrity towards people, the Earth and
it’s resources - full of raw, recycled timber, organic lines, and communal
spaces. For <i>Little Indi </i>Frank designed an innovative in-house composting
system that allowed for the cafe to be zero-waste.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1446031177/yobo0hfbg7ljmc5ut66k.jpg"" src="""" style=""width: 305.21px; height: 460px;""/></p>

</div></div>","We are Naked Indiana. Our mission is to serve our community by using food and art to connect us to our bodies, our Earth and each other. We are launching our latest project :
Native Kitchen & Bar A restaurant, wine bar, bakery, event space and community hub in the Blue Mountains (Lawson) - Designed to facilitate sustainable consumption, generate environmental awareness and encourage genuine community connection. Our plans are in place but we need your help - please read our story and the way we think about food!

NOTE***ALL DONATORS WILL BE INVITED TO OUR PRE OPENING PARTY - EXCLUSIVE ONLY TO CAMPAIGN DONERS. WOOD FIRED FOOD, BEER ON TAP, AND ENTERTAINMENT (KID FRIENDLY). IN ADDED APPRECIATION FOR YOU SUPPORT WE WANT TO MAKE YOU KNOW HOW SPECIAL WE AREWHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE ARE ABOUT
Native Kitchen & Bar is the latest project from Rebecca and Frank at Naked Indiana, an emerging social-enterprise that promotes
organic farming and sustainable urban lifestyles in Australia.
Naked Indiana emerged from our
passion for food, our love for the earth, and our enquiry into the processes
that connect us to our planet through how and what we consume. More of our story here: www.nakedindiana.com.au/aboutusWe have explored
cultivating more nourishing relationships with our bodies, our earth and each other,
through food and art, in a variety of small-scale projects (more details
below) - culminating in :
         Native Kitchen & Bar                             www.nativekitchenandbar.com
A restaurant and dynamic community space in Lawson, the Blue Mountains, serving a delicious, all-Australian, organically grown menu which is:
Kind to the earth
Nourishing to our bodies
Fair to our farmers
Community focused


OUR MENU is in constant creation as we flow with local farmers' crops. Our priority is to create a regional palate true to the Blue Mountains: fresh, flavoursome and organic. Enjoy our long grazing menu, quick take aways, fermentation bar - full of living foods, and the sourdough bakery (using wild bush fermentation, Leura spring water, and freshly milled organic grain). Our drinks menu is similarly unique with slow extraction juices, kombucha on-tap, boutique Australian wines, beers and spirits, a unique cocktail list, and quality coffee.

Local and organically grown 

Highlights Native Australian ingredients

Fermentation bar - the natural art of preservation

Boutique & batched brewed all Australian liquor
In house batch milled organic sourdough 

THE SPACE is carefully designed to facilitate community, connection and conversation, and will be used to run creative events aimed at generating environmental awareness and genuine social connection.

Native Kitchen & Bar will embody our enthusiasm for food, people and sustainable agriculture. We are committed to our planet and our community - so please come share in great food, new ideas, and a sustainable future - with creativity and community at its heart.









""Life is a series of choices. Three times a day we make a choice of what to eat, that’s already our ritual. If we can change the way we approach food then we can change the way someone interacts with the world three times a day.""          - Frank Meura


WHY SUPPORT? 
Discourse around environmental issues has become as heated as our climate! The information is often overwhelming, and it is easy to feel powerless and paralysed. Our belief is that though food and community we can make meaningful, immediate and pragmatic shifts towards a sustainable future.
Our mission is to serve our community by:

Supporting, and encouraging individuals as they embrace sustainable alternatives, what seems insignificant can have enormous effects.
Facilitate an immediate and personal relationship between farm and consumer.
Cultivating a sense of community that encourages genuine connection, sharing of resources, and collective action.
Generating momentum and support for other community and environmental initiatives

THE COMMUNITY INITIATIVES OF NATIVE KITCHEN: 
OPEN OVEN 
As part of an ongoing commitment to our community - we will open our commercial oven to our community fortnightly to allow an opportunity for home bakers to try out their loaves in a professional baking oven.
To empower our community and encourage an attitude of generosity - we encourage locals to develop the cooking skills and share them.
The service would be free with a  $2 donation to feeding the homeless.


FARM SPONSORSHIP & TRAINEESHIPS                                                                  We are hands on with our farmers and suppliers. Learning their passions and their struggles has helped us to better understand our role, as restauranteurs, within the supply chain, and to support sustainable agriculture as a whole.
Native Kitchen & Bar will help communicate and strengthen these relationships by facilitating 

on site excursions

farm stays

harvest events

farmer interships

fundraisers for farmers in need



We will be working intimately with Aaron Brocken of Hawkesbury Hampers. Aaron has made it his mission to change the argricultural face of the Blue Mountains/ Hawkesbury region transitioning under-utilised and or conventional spaces into thriving organic market farms. 
Linking with Aaron to support these efforts Native Kitchen & Bar will offer its staff the opportunity to do a paid apprenticeship on the farm under Aaron, learning the ins and outs of organic agriculture and sustainability, whilst growing crops for the restaurant.  
Our vision with Aaron is to see the Blue Mountains/Hawkesbury showcase how a true, sustainable network can support a growing Sydney Metropolitan population.






COOKING WORKSHOPS 
Sustainable food supply is important - but the community needs to know how to cook it. We need to readdress the way we, as a culture, approach food. In monthly workshop events we will cover topics such as: How to eat seasonally, resourceful fermentation, and creative cooking.
ARTS & CULTUREThere is no better way to communicate an idea, inspire change or simply trigger innovative thought than through art. Native Kitchen and Bar will serve as a pop up gallery space, open mic and live drawing venue for local and visiting artists who have nature & community at the heart of their work. 


WHERE THE MONEY WILL GO?
We have secured our location and have commenced fit out, we will be opening this coming Christmas Eve (24/12/2015). We are appealing to you to assist us in funding the completion of the fit-out and our in-house, small-scale commercial bakery.

WANT TO KNOW MORE?? …. TAKE A CLOSER LOOK 

OUR SOURDOUGH CULTURE                                                                                     Our sourdough culture was created just over a year ago, in the bush of Wentworth Falls, Blue Mountains. For three days the freshly milled rye mixed with local Leura spring water sat to ferment under the Eucalyptus trees picking up the unique nuances of our native bush land and, most importantly, its life giving yeasts. From then on we fed this starter making each loaf with these two pure ingredients: Leura spring water and freshly milled grain. 

When we create breads from our starter we often add native ingredients like bush tomato, pepper berry and salt bush, hand harvested pink river salt & activated cultures like kombucha, yoghurt, fermented veggies & fermented grain.When we open Native Kitchen & Bar all our sourdough offerings will be baked in a wood-fired oven, that we built ourselves out of mud brick.








Our repertoire will include:

100 % freshly milled grain sourdough loaves 
50 / 50  - rye / whole grain white & spelt loaves
Kombucha sourdough on a rotating recipe
Sourdough focaccia with native spices
Organic sprouted sourdough loaves
In-house cakes
Native wattle & bush honey granola.

With enough support we would love to expand to create:


100% sourdough ciabatta & ficelle

Sourdough croissants
Sourdough puff pastry
Sourdough pies

GROWING TO ORDER - A NEW SYSTEM                                                                  Over the last few years we have been networking our suppliers on a grassroots level. We value these relationships dearly as they are paramount in delivering an authentic farm to plate service, and attaining a more sustainable food future. At Native Kitchen & Bar we have the very unique opportunity to work side by side local organic farms, who are pioneers in sustainable farming and like-minded visionaries for our agricultural future.

We will have a lot of projects in the near future as we work to get this organization off the ground, establish a legal non-profit status, and build a support network for our cause. <br/><br/>This is the beginning of great things in the way of changing and advancing mental health for Texans. We have many goals and a strong vision. We aim to become an independent non-profit so that we can establish a peer support warmline number for after-hours support.

We are hoping to get this up and running in a timely manner, but we have a lot of steps to accomplish before we can get the warmline up and running.

<p>* Finding and retaining a lawyer to assist in the legalities involved in starting this type of organization including filing the federal tax paperwork for 501 status.  </p>
<p>* Networking.  We are located in a smaller town in Deep East Texas and a lot of the advocacy and action is in Austin, the state capital.  We need to be able to afford travel to and from Austin to be able to network with other, larger, organizations, find partners to assist us in our mission, and speak with legislatures to impress the importance of our project and overall goal to create the warmline.</p>

There is a grey area, an in between, an area of distress if you will.  Our ultimate goal is to establish a toll-free ""warmline"" to offer peer-guided support and resources to help move an individual out of distress and to help prevent them from going into a mental health crisis situation.  This warmline will be staffed with individuals with a mental health diagnosis, experience with treatment, and considered in recovery who are comfortable sharing their personal stories.  They will be supervised by Certified Peer Specialists who are trained in mental health recovery.</p>
<p>The impact that we hope to see is an increase in knowledge about the importance of taking care of one's mental health needs, offer support and guidance to others, and share our stories to help prevent crisis situations from happening or provide needed intervention should a crisis occur.</p>

""I'm here to bring connection, creation, inspiration and beauty to the world. That is who I am. Sometimes in life we're given a rare opportunity to expand ourselves in a way that is far beyond our imagination. It's a culmination of all of our dreams. This is one of those times."" - Ele Keats


Hello and thank you for visiting our campaign. My name is Ele Keats. I am an actress and jewelry designer.  My original jewelry shop was a small pop-up and we had a wonderful successful business that we so loved. After over a year in our 100 sq. ft. space we felt the need to expand and create something bigger and create more opportunities for the community. By expanding into a space over 10 times our original shop we will be able to include other artists work and more. I will be offering designers a place to showcase their work as well as introducing the community to fulfilling workshops.


This will be a new space that will provide opportunities to learn from prolific teachers, yoga, good health, exploring love, and connecting to yourself and others. We all need a place to land feel ourselves fully and just breathe! I am opening my shop to be just that.
My dream of this new space is that it will be a place to connect to yourself, a place to unwind, breathe, ground, transform, and inspire. A place where you know you are safe and supported and you can spread you wings and find yourself and be yourself. This new space is a huge gift and that is why I decided to launch this campaign - so we can all share in the fun and celebration of this together! I'm inviting you to be a part of it. If you feel moved to help create this new space and provide growth opportunities for the community please consider a contribution. We have some great incentives to show our gratitude, too! 
Our funding goal
We need funding to completely remodel the space, to provide scholarships for the workshops that we present, and to bring in teachers.  We need a total of $45,000 to achieve our total goal for this space. $30,000 for remodeling the empty, raw space; $10,000 for teachers fees; and $5,000 for scholarship funding. We will use what fund we do raise to do the work we need to open up and offer a great new place to grow! We have many levels of contributions and great perks for each level!

</h3> <p>At the age of 12 Ashleigh wrote a letter to an organization that offers dolphin therapy after reading an article in a magazine on behalf of her friend who had been diagnosed with San Filipo disease and asked for the chance for her friend to swim with dolphins. This is just one example of what an exceptionally giving, caring, and passionate person Ashleigh was. Each year after that, she created her own jewelry and sold it in order to fund a child every year to go to Florida and swim therapeutically with the dolphins as well as to donate to local and national charities.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433863222/hrmk5jgb6wsvj6fzvbct.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>In October of 2004, at the age of 17, Ashleigh Delia Woodfield died suddenly in a car accident and every year since then her family has maintained this Memorial Foundation and Scholarship fund. Although she isn't with us anymore, we want to carry on her tradition of living and loving selflessly, constantly succeeding in making the world a better place, and touching as many lives as possible.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We continually appreciate any donations - this is a 60 day campaign but the Foundation is continually accepting donations in order to annually meet our goals. <br/></p> <p>It has been<b> 10 </b>years since her passing and we are asking for donations of <b>$10</b> (of course, we won't say no to more if you'd like!!!) within the next 60 days. <br/></p>
<p>It costs about $2,200 for the unique opportunity for each child to go to Florida and swim with the dolphins. Our goal is to send one child with the funds we earn in the next 60 days (and every year after) and hopefully, if we are able to raise additional funds, we will be donating to charities that Ashleigh was passionate about.</p>
<p>For your donation, we would like to say thank you in a way Ashleigh would. Check out the perks section to see what we're offering! Items from homemade jewelry to cards with her artwork to poster size prints of her artwork as well as artwork of her friends and family.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>Not only will your donation support Ashleigh's cause but it will help us keep a part of her here with us. It isn't about the quantity of years in a life, but the quality - and for those who didn't know her she was an angel on earth. </p>
<p>Help us maintain the tradition of providing high school juniors with scholarships to help them go to college, sending sick children to therapeutic dolphin therapy, and donating to important causes.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>Get the word out! Share this link and/or the link to the Memorial Foundation page on your social media. If you knew Ashleigh, share the moments that you spent with her. There is a testimonial page on our website (see link below) where we ask you to share these stories with the world. <br/><br/><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""http://res.cloudinary.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1433860987/q2txujtffymhnchhaalb.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

In October of 2004, at the age of 17, Ashleigh Delia Woodfield died suddenly in a car accident and every year since then her family has maintained this Memorial Foundation and Scholarship fund. Although she isn't with us anymore, we want to carry on her tradition of living and loving selflessly, constantly succeeding in making the world a better place, and touching as many lives as possible.
  What We Need & What You Get
We continually appreciate any donations - this is a 60 day campaign but the Foundation is continually accepting donations in order to annually meet our goals.  It has been 10 years since her passing and we are asking for donations of $10 (of course, we won't say no to more if you'd like!!!) within the next 60 days. 
It costs about $2,200 for the unique opportunity for each child to go to Florida and swim with the dolphins. Our goal is to send one child with the funds we earn in the next 60 days (and every year after) and hopefully, if we are able to raise additional funds, we will be donating to charities that Ashleigh was passionate about.
For your donation, we would like to say thank you in a way Ashleigh would. Check out the perks section to see what we're offering! Items from homemade jewelry to cards with her artwork to poster size prints of her artwork as well as artwork of her friends and family.
  The Impact Not only will your donation support Ashleigh's cause but it will help us keep a part of her here with us. It isn't about the quantity of years in a life, but the quality - and for those who didn't know her she was an angel on earth. 
Help us maintain the tradition of providing high school juniors with scholarships to help them go to college, sending sick children to therapeutic dolphin therapy, and donating to important causes.
  Other Ways You Can HelpGet the word out! Share this link and/or the link to the Memorial Foundation page on your social media. If you knew Ashleigh, share the moments that you spent with her. There is a testimonial page on our website (see link below) where we ask you to share these stories with the world.

<p>On January 10, 2015 Massey Creek Farms lost their barn to a
fire. Besides the building itself, the blaze also claimed the lives of four
Karakachan pups and their mother, Markey, Garland’s beloved livestock guard
dogs. As a customer and friend of Garland McCollum, owner of Massey Creek Farms,
I raise the call to supporters of local, sustainable family farms and the food
they grow. Let’s rebuild a barn!  </p>
<p><b>We’ve got a tough row to hoe…</b></p>
<p>We need: $25,000.  This will cover all materials needed
to rebuild as well as expenses, such as electricians and carpenters that may be
unable to donate their time. The barn will be designed to house orphaned baby livestock
as well as Karakachan puppies—adorably fluffy guard-dogs-in-training.</p>
<p><b>Reap what we sow…</b></p>
<p>Garland started out as a commercial farmer, and has seen
what devastation overcrowding of farm animals can wreak. As a result, 6years
ago, he quite literally opened the stalls and reformed his entire philosophy of
farming. Massey Creek now proudly prioritizes sustainability and pasture raised
livestock, home to pasture raised chickens, sheep, pigs, and turkeys living
large under the shining sun. Garland maintains his livestock on a strict NO,
NO, NO model of: No Antibiotics, No Animal By-products, and No Added Hormones.  All his efforts are aimed at leaving our
little part of the world better for us having been here, so generations to come
will enjoy the products of this resource we humbly call home. Contribute to

<p>My name is Ranjith Kumar Pandranki and I am working with Aga Khan Rural Support India (AKRSPI) NGO at Niwali Block of Barwani Dist, MP.

I seek your help in a new programme that I intend to start at this block in the area of Rural Self Employment.

    The Impact 


Agriculture is the principal
source of livelihood for more than 75% of the population in Niwali block.


There is an urgent need to
uplift this sector and improve the socio-economic condition of the farmers.


Beekeeping will help
increase the crop production anywhere between 30% -80% thereby putting more income in
small farmer households.


Beekeeping products
(honey and beeswax) raise the income of beekeepers, contrary to non-beekeepers
who depend mainly on commercial/cash crops.


Challenges The major challenges I face at this juncture are



The community fear the wild bees(Apis Dorsata) which exist at some locations.

The lack of awareness of the community about the benefits of beekeeping.

I am planning to conduct village level meeting where I will show some videos to the community which would first remove the fear for bees and also raise awareness about the benefits of beekeeping. In this regard I have visited a nearby place where the farmers have started beekeeping with the help of an NGO.

<p>Current wet feeders (except for our original CATSOMAT) do not deliver constant and reliable cooling. All other feeders use ice packs to cool food, and this is only a temporary measure lasting at most 12 hours. CATSOMAT II uses thermoelectric cooling. What is that? </p>

<p>Thermo-electric cooling is very similar to standard refrigeration, except it does not use a compressor. <b>Thermo-electric cooling is also known as a ""Peltier"" device.</b> Peltier technology uses electricity to transfer heat from one side of a metal plate to the other side. The heat transferred is ejected (via a whisper-quiet fan), and the cooling is accomplished. It seems like magic, but it is not. It is the miracle of a solid-state refrigerator.</p>
<p>CATSOMAT II uses thermoelectric cooling technology to efficiently cool your pet’s food, keeping it at a safe temperature of 42.8 degrees fahrenheit. For comparison, your household refrigerator might keep food at between 42 and 47 degrees fahrenheit. Thermoelectric cooling is far more energy efficient than standard, compressor-based cooling technology.</p>
<p>Because CATSOMAT II has seven feeding compartments, you can easily serve dry food, too. You can choose to turn off the cooling whenever you want, or use it to serve wet food at one time, and dry food at another. All in one convenient setting.</p>

<h4 style=""font-weight: bold;"">CATSOMAT identifies your pet using RFID technology:</h4>
<p>If you have “chipped” your cat — the grain-sized 
transponder inserted into most rescue pets today — CATSOMAT II uses that to automatically recognize each cat, individually. Each feeding bowl inside the CATSOMAT 
II can be mapped to an individual pet’s transponder, and only the bowl you designate will be presented. <span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">This works for up to seven cats!</span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span></span></p>

<p>Older cats particularly require small food portions distributed throughout the day. For ill cats, regular and safe intake of their medication is crucial. In combination with our RFID technology, an intelligent locking mechanism ensures that the feeding bowls are automatically locked in and cooled after feeding. </p>
<p></p>
<p>This way, each cat can eat what they want and then come back to the same food later. CATSOMAT II ensures that only the food — perhaps containing medications — for a particular cat is presented to that cat, and that cat only.</p>

CATSOMAT II ensures that your cats do
 not overeat because they learn that they can eat whenever they want — 
up to the portions you allow.<br/><br/>This is important because, unlike dogs,
 cats stomachs do not “dilate” — they do
 not expand to accept a lot of food all at once. Cats naturally prefer 
several small meals, and CATSOMAT II makes it possible. There is some 
evidence that feeding your cat in this naturally-occurring way leads to 
better health.<span><br/></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><br/></span>

<p>Most cat feeders simply DO NOT secure food against clever kitties.

<p><b>BATTERY BACKUP</b></p>
<p>In the event of a power failure, the integrated battery supplies power for up to 60 hours of operation (when fully charged). Although the cooling is deactivated when on battery power, the meals will still be presented according to your programmed schedule. The CATSOMAT II is well-insulated and will keep food properly cool for the limited duration of most power failures. Once power is restored, the cooling function automatically returns and food is then maintained at the temperature you have selected. Importantly, your program is preserved, so you will not need to reenter information after a power failure.</p>
<p>Important (and obvious) note: If there is no power for an extended duration, owners must replace perishable wet food in the tray at the earliest opportunity to ensure the health of your cat. Cats will not eat spoiled food.<br/></p>

<p>As with many entrepreneurs and innovators, the idea that led to CATSOMAT came from the vision of one man: Donald R. Pilz (51). After more than 20 years as a successful manager in the transport and logistic industry, Mr. Pilz was looking for a new business challenge. </p>
<p>After the prototype of CATSOMAT was developed several years ago, Donald Pilz became determined to build and distribute it. He started the company. </p>
<p>Mr. Pilz knew that all products and options available in the market simply did not meet the needs of millions of pet owners. </p>
<p>With the support of his family and an engaged team of engineers and product designers, Mr. Pilz developed the first CATSOMAT and brought it to market. </p>
<p>On 17th June 2011 the first CATSOMAT was launched in Germany as part of “Maintier 2011” (German animal trade show) and was successfully marketed by the then newly established CATSOMAT GmbH &amp; Co. Pet Products KG.<b> </b><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1197114/files/20150204140822-catsomat_logo-01.jpg?1423087702"" src="""" style=""font-weight: bold; letter-spacing: 0px; width: 246.74801061007958px; height: 152px;""/><span><br/></span><span><a href=""#Navigation"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">-&gt; back to the top</a></span> <br/></p>

<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Q: Why is the CATSOMAT so <i>expensive </i>compared to other feeders?</b></div>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">A:</b><b> </b><i></i><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px; font-style: italic;"">For a device to operate independently and safely in your home there is a whole host of safety criteria, regulatory standards, and design specifications to be engineered.  CATSOMAT has done the engineering, regulatory compliance, and safety studies for you -- and then manufactured the device to those specifications.</span><i></i><p><span><br/></span><i>What else do you own to make your life easier? iPhones? Expensive kitchen appliances? How about a gorgeous flat-screen TV? All these things serve to make our lives easier and enjoyable. Catsomat will make your life easier, too -- and help keep your cat healthy!<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></i></p>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Q: Is the CATSOMAT safe to operate when I am not home?</b></div>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">A:</b><b> </b><i>Yes. The entire purpose of the CATSOMAT is to provide hygienically-cooled wet food to your pet, safely, when you are away.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></i>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Q: How long will food stay fresh?</b></div>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">A: </b><i>Wet food is a perishable item. The CATSOMAT will maintain food freshness for the same amount of time an opened can of food can be safely stored in a household refrigerator (6°C). In general, up to 3-5 days for canned food. Up to 3 days for pre-frozen raw pet food.</i>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<div><i>Safe food handling (for humans and pets) is something we cannot answer here. But suffice it to say that safe food handling practices should always be observed.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></i></div>
<p>
</p>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Q: Can I use CATSOMAT with ""raw food""?</b></div>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">A:</b><b> </b><i>Yes. Please note, however, that raw food has not been pasteurized nor treated, and is thus even more perishable than canned food. CATSOMAT strongly recommends pre-freezing raw food placed in the device so that it thaws for presentation in a cooled environment. Pre-frozen raw food should never be left in the device for longer than 3 days.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></i>
</div>
<p>
</p>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Q: Is the CATSOMAT expensive to operate?</b></div>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">A: </b><i>Not at all. It is equivalent to a 90-Watt lightbulb in power consumption. Energy consumption is a mere fraction of <i>standard, compressor-type refrigeration.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></i></i>
</div>

</p>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Q: Doesn't plastic harbor bacteria?</b></div>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">A: </b><i>The feeding tray is scratch-resistant, food-safe polycarbonate, and thus does not develop micro-scratches that can harbor bacteria. We have studied this in real-time deployments for three years on the CATSOMAT I. The feed tray material is safe.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></i>
</div>

</p>
<div style=""font-weight: bold;""><b>Q: Is the CATSOMAT II self-cleaning and self-filling?</b></div>
<p>
</p>
<div>
<b style=""font-weight: bold;"">A:</b> <i>No. We asked our engineers to accomplish this. Sadly, they have not. You must fill and maintain the CATSOMAT. Happily, the CATSOMAT dish can be run through an automatic dishwasher.<span><br/></span><span><br/></span></i>

FOR CAT FRIENDS, CUDDLE CHAMPIONS AND CANNED FOOD OPENERS







Incredibly easy


CATSOMAT wet food feeder simplifies & ensures feeding while giving your cat the consistency they crave!

We enjoy our fuzzy friends, and want the best for them.
But there’s one problem many have not been able to solve: Feeding nutritious, properly cooled wet food to different cats at different times — maybe in different amounts. CATSOMAT can help you solve this problem.

As our pets age and their needs change; or if we add a second cat or more: CATSOMAT will help you care for them as much as you love them.
We know you want to provide the best possible feedings and care to your pets. We do, too. CATSOMAT is here to help.
Of course, it can't replace us. 
And it's not meant to.
But it can reliably cover for us.
when we are not at home. 


CATSOMAT: Truly unique and truly helpful



COOLED WET FOOD: CATSOMAT is the ONLY thermo-electrically cooled WET FOOD automatic feeder in the world! Unlike others that attempt to use ice packs (we think using ice packs is totally ineffective), CATSOMAT continuously cools and preserves fresh and healthy food.
MULTI-CAT HOUSEHOLDS: CATSOMAT is perfect for multi-cat households: Using RFID technology, CATSOMAT allows each cat to receive only the food intended for it. Need to prevent one cat from stealing another cat’s meal? CATSOMAT is the answer.

PROMOTE GOOD HEALTH: CATSOMAT will help keep your kitties healthy: It is ideal for safely feeding elderly cats or pets with special health needs — such as cats that need regular and reliable medication.


WEIGHT CONTROL: Ideal for diet management: If your cat is overweight and you would like to gently control intake, CATSOMAT will ensure that only the food you serve will be available when you want it to be.


NATURAL FEEDING PATTERN: Some experts believe multiple, small feedings throughout the day is a more natural and healthful feeding pattern. CATSOMAT allows you to mimic natural feeding patterns.


ALWAYS ON DUTY: CATSOMAT is on duty, ready to serve your pet 24/7.

Tech for Pet: How it Works


The CATSOMAT II is unique and cannot be compared with any other cat feeder.





Current wet feeders (except for our original CATSOMAT) do not deliver constant and reliable cooling. All other feeders use ice packs to cool food, and this is only a temporary measure lasting at most 12 hours. CATSOMAT II uses thermoelectric cooling. What is that? 

THERMO-ELECTRIC COOLING: WHAT IS IT?


Thermo-electric cooling is very similar to standard refrigeration, except it does not use a compressor. Thermo-electric cooling is also known as a ""Peltier"" device. Peltier technology uses electricity to transfer heat from one side of a metal plate to the other side. The heat transferred is ejected (via a whisper-quiet fan), and the cooling is accomplished. It seems like magic, but it is not. It is the miracle of a solid-state refrigerator.
CATSOMAT II uses thermoelectric cooling technology to efficiently cool your pet’s food, keeping it at a safe temperature of 42.8 degrees fahrenheit. For comparison, your household refrigerator might keep food at between 42 and 47 degrees fahrenheit. Thermoelectric cooling is far more energy efficient than standard, compressor-based cooling technology.
Because CATSOMAT II has seven feeding compartments, you can easily serve dry food, too. You can choose to turn off the cooling whenever you want, or use it to serve wet food at one time, and dry food at another. All in one convenient setting.


Your cat won’t eat food that's too cold? We have you covered: CATSOMAT II 
can preheat wet food just before serving!

Since cold food sometimes can upset a cat’s stomach, we’ve created an 
integrated innovative heating function that turns on to preheat the food
 right before it is served at feeding time. You can turn the preheat 
function on or off, depending on your cat’s preference. Or, if you are 
using dry food, you can turn it off altogether.



With the CATSOMAT II, the safe and reliable feeding of several cats in a household is incredibly simplified. 



CATSOMAT identifies your pet using RFID technology:
If you have “chipped” your cat — the grain-sized 
transponder inserted into most rescue pets today — CATSOMAT II uses that to automatically recognize each cat, individually. Each feeding bowl inside the CATSOMAT 
II can be mapped to an individual pet’s transponder, and only the bowl you designate will be presented. This works for up to seven cats!








Older cats particularly require small food portions distributed throughout the day. For ill cats, regular and safe intake of their medication is crucial. In combination with our RFID technology, an intelligent locking mechanism ensures that the feeding bowls are automatically locked in and cooled after feeding. 

This way, each cat can eat what they want and then come back to the same food later. CATSOMAT II ensures that only the food — perhaps containing medications — for a particular cat is presented to that cat, and that cat only.





Why multiple small meals are ideal for cats

CATSOMAT II ensures that your cats do
 not overeat because they learn that they can eat whenever they want — 
up to the portions you allow.This is important because, unlike dogs,
 cats stomachs do not “dilate” — they do
 not expand to accept a lot of food all at once. Cats naturally prefer 
several small meals, and CATSOMAT II makes it possible. There is some 
evidence that feeding your cat in this naturally-occurring way leads to 
better health.
-> back to the top




Do you also have a hungry dog in your household that nibbles at the kitty dish? 





No problem!

CATSOMAT II not only ensures that individual cats are fed 
their designated meals, it also makes sure that Fido does not eat 
kitty’s food. None but your RFID-identified cat will be able to eat your pet’s food.
Uneaten food is returned to be properly cooled after you cat eats only a portion — automatically!One cat or many, CATSOMAT is definitely the right choice!


Extremely easy to use — while at home or away! 


The touch screen is incredibly easy to use.
You can choose to program the CATSOMAT II with the simple and intuitive 
touch screen.
Other feeders can be defeated by clever cats. Not CATSOMAT. The touch-screen interface makes sure that not even the cleverest of 
cats can modify the program.
Does your cat use a smartphone? Didn't think so. But CATSOMAT
 II does: It is the ONLY wet food feeder in the world that allows you to control 
it using a smartphone or tablet interface!
You 
can rest assured that your kitty will be served food on the schedule you set.



The WiFi-enabled CATSOMAT App
CATSOMAT II is the only cooled cat feeder in the world that can be controlled at any time and from anywhere in the world using an internet-connected desktop computer, tablet or smartphone.
The CATSOMAT II App that this campaign will help fund will allow you to control and reprogram every setting, from anywhere. This is especially useful for unexpected changes in your schedule. The only thing that must be done manually is refilling the device.






For finicky cats who insist on just the right food



Using seven 13.5 oz feeding dishes, you can present any one of them to your cat(s) at any time — from anywhere in the world (using your internet connected device and the smartphone app we will build with this campaign). The feeding tray is food-safe, acid-resistant, and dishwasher safe.
We will make several standard, pre-programmed menus (e.g., the “weekend menu”) that quickly and easily ensures your pet is lovingly cared for while you are away. Your cat will be thrilled, and you will be confident you are showing them all the love they need until you are able to return.
-> back to the top







Knowing that everything is okay.




The integrated camera allows you to look in on your pet at any time, from anywhere. You can check in to make sure they are eating the food you provided.

The CATSOMAT II, using the funding from this campaign, will have real-time video recording (and single images) to let you know that your cat is feeding properly. You will also be able to receive a text message alerting you to when your cat feeds using the smartphone app. Or you could choose to look in on and even talk to your kitty when they are feeding.







Say ""Hello kitty"" - even when you are not at home


Our trigger call function enables you to individually setup a trigger call for each cat through the integrated microphone that plays when it is feeding time. Cats love rituals and you will be amazed to see just how thrilled your pets will be when they hear your voice. 
And we have even gone a step further!



With the CATSOMAT II, not only can you individually call your pets during feeding sessions, you can also get to talk to them from anywhere through the integrated speaker and microphone function thanks to the WLAN connection. Through the integrated microphones, you can hear how relaxed your pets are and soothed to hear your voice.










Tamper-proof locking technology
Most cat feeders simply DO NOT secure food against clever kitties. The CATSOMAT II guarantees through its tamper-proof design that even your cleverest kitty will not get into food not actively presented. The body of the device uses a dual locking mechanism that can only be opened by human hands.
CATSOMAT II has an integrated battery backup 



BATTERY BACKUP
In the event of a power failure, the integrated battery supplies power for up to 60 hours of operation (when fully charged). Although the cooling is deactivated when on battery power, the meals will still be presented according to your programmed schedule. The CATSOMAT II is well-insulated and will keep food properly cool for the limited duration of most power failures. Once power is restored, the cooling function automatically returns and food is then maintained at the temperature you have selected. Importantly, your program is preserved, so you will not need to reenter information after a power failure.
Important (and obvious) note: If there is no power for an extended duration, owners must replace perishable wet food in the tray at the earliest opportunity to ensure the health of your cat. Cats will not eat spoiled food.



Form follows function - It works with 100% confidence and is stylish at the same time.




FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION
In the best German way, our motto is “form follows function.” The main challenge was to be in the highest degree certain that the CATSOMAT II would work every time, all the time, exactly as you programmed it. The CATSOMAT II is made with tested, food-safe materials and safely operates so that you can be sure your pet can use this machine safely with absolute confidence.
Happily, the device turned out to be attractive thanks to its appealing and timeless design.
The first CATSOMAT IIs will be produced in an elegant shade of grey. Later, we will offer other designer colors — and perhaps even unique, one-of-a-kind colors that you choose!
If you want a particular color, then you should take a look at our ""Special Color PERK""!

The CATSOMAT I was the first thermoelectric-cooled pet feeder in the world when it was introduced 3 years ago. The CATSOMAT product is still unique. CATSOMAT I has given hundreds of people worldwide a safe solution to feed their pets.
We listened to our current customers, and now we want to take this wonderful device to the next level. That is the purpose of this campaign: To deliver on the promise of CATSOMAT by building an even better wet food feeder based on the valuable feedback of our current customers.



The 2011 CATSOMAT I, opened and filled
The CATSOMAT I has been through many product tests and has completely satisfied many people, worldwide. We are known as the best feeder in the world. 
Furthermore, in almost all of the current product tests, the CATSOMAT I still comes out on top.
Currently, our device is rated the best also among the big cat feeders test on the “hundkatzemaus” show (lit. “Dog-Cat-Mouse”; German TV Program). 
Where we are today




For over 2 years, our ambitious team of German engineers and product designers has been working almost every day on the vision of the new CATSOMAT. The basic development, technical feasibility studies and the preliminary tests have already been completed. 


We are strongly dedicated to have the device ready for you.

   About us - the story behind the story

As with many entrepreneurs and innovators, the idea that led to CATSOMAT came from the vision of one man: Donald R. Pilz (51). After more than 20 years as a successful manager in the transport and logistic industry, Mr. Pilz was looking for a new business challenge. 
After the prototype of CATSOMAT was developed several years ago, Donald Pilz became determined to build and distribute it. He started the company. 
Mr. Pilz knew that all products and options available in the market simply did not meet the needs of millions of pet owners. 
With the support of his family and an engaged team of engineers and product designers, Mr. Pilz developed the first CATSOMAT and brought it to market. 
On 17th June 2011 the first CATSOMAT was launched in Germany as part of “Maintier 2011” (German animal trade show) and was successfully marketed by the then newly established CATSOMAT GmbH & Co. Pet Products KG. -> back to the top

FAQ


Q: Why is the CATSOMAT so expensive compared to other feeders?



A: For a device to operate independently and safely in your home there is a whole host of safety criteria, regulatory standards, and design specifications to be engineered.  CATSOMAT has done the engineering, regulatory compliance, and safety studies for you -- and then manufactured the device to those specifications.What else do you own to make your life easier? iPhones? Expensive kitchen appliances? How about a gorgeous flat-screen TV? All these things serve to make our lives easier and enjoyable. Catsomat will make your life easier, too -- and help keep your cat healthy!



Q: Is the CATSOMAT safe to operate when I am not home?



A: Yes. The entire purpose of the CATSOMAT is to provide hygienically-cooled wet food to your pet, safely, when you are away.



Q: How long will food stay fresh?



A: Wet food is a perishable item. The CATSOMAT will maintain food freshness for the same amount of time an opened can of food can be safely stored in a household refrigerator (6°C). In general, up to 3-5 days for canned food. Up to 3 days for pre-frozen raw pet food.



Safe food handling (for humans and pets) is something we cannot answer here. But suffice it to say that safe food handling practices should always be observed.


Q: Can I use CATSOMAT with ""raw food""?



A: Yes. Please note, however, that raw food has not been pasteurized nor treated, and is thus even more perishable than canned food. CATSOMAT strongly recommends pre-freezing raw food placed in the device so that it thaws for presentation in a cooled environment. Pre-frozen raw food should never be left in the device for longer than 3 days.



Q: Is the CATSOMAT expensive to operate?



A: Not at all. It is equivalent to a 90-Watt lightbulb in power consumption. Energy consumption is a mere fraction of standard, compressor-type refrigeration.



Q: Aren't plastics harmful to use in storing food?



A: Not all plastics are the same. The plastic we use is polycarbonate, a stable form of plastic that is exceptionally durable. It is dishwasher safe, and food safe.



Q: Doesn't plastic harbor bacteria?



A: The feeding tray is scratch-resistant, food-safe polycarbonate, and thus does not develop micro-scratches that can harbor bacteria. We have studied this in real-time deployments for three years on the CATSOMAT I. The feed tray material is safe.



Q: Is the CATSOMAT II self-cleaning and self-filling?



A: No. We asked our engineers to accomplish this. Sadly, they have not. You must fill and maintain the CATSOMAT. Happily, the CATSOMAT dish can be run through an automatic dishwasher.



Q: Will the CATSOMAT II smartphone app work if I do not have internet connectivity and a WiFi-enabled router at my home?



A: Nope.



Q: Will the CATSOMAT II smartphone app alert me about any issues, such as power failures?



A: Yep.



Q: Will I be able to track whether my cat is eating?



A: Yes. We think, particularly for cats with special health concerns, this is a marvelous advance. You will be able to configure smartphone alerts that tell you your cat is feeding, and view your cat feeding via the FREE smartphone app.



Q: Will I be able to review the history of my pet's feeding habits?



A: Yes. 



Q: What about internet security protocols and privacy?



A: You are a smart consumer. Everyone should be aware of devices that connect to the internet, and whether they are deployed with encryption and security. The CATSOMAT II internet-connected functions will have encryption and security built in.



Q: I do not know if my cat has an RFID chip in place, yet. How do I tell?



A: If you adopted your cat through a rescue shelter, it is very likely that the RFID chip is in place. The surest way to find out is to take your pet to a shelter or veterinarian and determine if the RFID signal shows up on the monitors there.



Or, if you get the CATSOMAT II (and we think you should), you will be able to see the RFID unique identifier via the CATSOMAT II display and interface, if one is there.


Q: What if my cat does not have an RFID chip? Or if I do not want to insert one?



A: There are readily-available RFID  collars on the market. But we do not recommend them. 



Q: I do not want to add an RFID chip to my pet, via collar or insert. Will the device work?



A: The device can be programmed to work on an automated schedule that does not rely on RFID recognition. But using the CATSOMAT II in this way defeats many of the values and purposes of the device. We think you should reconsider.

The first and most important, to help a person who has been in prison for 34yrs and counting (release date 29 Oct 2018) develop a solid release plan. This includes having funds available to secure a place to live upon release, purchase a vehicle, helping secure employment and the basic necessities of starting life from square one, like: smart phone, tablet/laptop, clothing, food, license, etc. Imagine this: being isolated from society for 34+yrs, since 1981! Then imagine what it would be like getting thrown into society with literally just the clothing on your back, possibly no place to live, and a $40 release check. Having to start your life from that point on is a challenging thought to say the least - no resources, no family or friends, no place to live, no job, a scary position to be in. What would your first move be if you were in this situation? </p><p>In addition to funding my release plan, you would be helping me continue my Leather and Jewelry business. Pictured are some of the leather and jewelry items I make. My initial plan was to make and sell these products, using the profits to fund my release, getting a place to live, a vehicle, the basic necessities to start life again. Unfortunately, every person I have partnered with has either bailed out in mid-project, leaving hundreds of dollars in products and cash in limbo, and eventually I had to take the loss, or they have just outright burnt me for all my products and cash. To date, a loss of at least $5000. Shows that all criminals aren't in prison. This crowdfund will help buy much needed leather and jewelry supplies to keep production flowing. Also this will help compensate my business partner for her much appreciated, tireless help, guidance, and management skills. </p><p>Meg Davis is my business partner. She has been instrumental in getting this crowdfund together for me, not to mention managing sales, orders for materials, researching and organizing other projects all while being a student. Add to that, Meg is the founder/director of the Stories Project (weekofactionmovement.wordpress.com). As a victim of anti-gay violence, not having a vehicle or forum to communicate her struggle motivated her to create the Stories Project to, at the very least, open the dialogue about problems that victims and their loved ones face after violence. This is a strong and brave young woman with her heart in the right place who is doing what is rare in society today: helping others deal with these serious problems.

Society looks down on ex-convicts, but the truth of the matter is, convicts get released back into society. The recidivism rate in the United States is somewhere around 67%, meaning that almost 7 out of 10 ex-convicts commit new crimes and return to prison. I do not want or plan to be one of those 7. I'm not a gang member, drug dealer, or street hustler. I grew up lower-middle class and did not have the proper guidance in my youth, which resulted in me making bad decisions in the beginning of adulthood. This is no excuse or justification. I committed a crime and have served the time. It's now my responsibility to get out and be a productive member of society. To accomplish this, I have taken the opportunity to educate myself and develop employable skills that I can put to immediate use upon release. I have an entrepreneurial mindset and business plans in development  that I would like to put into action. I have a drive to get out there and be successful, and try to help people out there struggling. However corny or trite it sounds, I want to take my success and pay it forward to help troubled youth before they end up in prison.

</div></div>","I am opening First Line Defense Houston LLC. an infantry veteran owned and operated training company with the goal of achieving two things. First, provide personalized IN-HOME tactical Self Defense Training, on-site home threat assessments, and many other tactical defense courses ensuring clients have the skills and confidence to protect themselves and their families against anyone that decides to make their home part of tomorrow's morning news. And second, to build a company that can offer a career option for Combat Veterans returning to civilian life. Specifically, i will be creating positions that require the skills these soldiers already possess. And more importantly, hire them at a pay that an adult can actually provide for a family on. 
The Goal is to reach $200,000.00 in funding. This will cover the following, ♠ $20,000.00 per year (x2 years) into Marketing/Advertising building clients to the    point of providing 12 to 16 courses a week, consistently scheduled out two weeks.♠ $9,000.00 over 3 years covering Continued training for myself and instructors,         ensuring we are providing the absolute best training possible for our clients,♠ $15,000.00 one time cost on training equipment and company equipment                  to provide our clients with an amazing experience that will have them bragging to      everyone they know. (Thus driving business to us)
♠ $35,000.00 (x2) salary to myself and my partner, allowing my to leave my current    ""day Job"" and focus 100% of my time and energy on developing this company.           With this one year, I will turn this into a self reliant profitable business.
   ♠ $49,000.00 in the bank as working capitol to cover additional start up costs,              future employees, and expansion into new, wider markets. With the threat of home invasions rising every day, the risk has simply become to great to brush off and ""worry about it tomorrow"". It is time to prepare for the what-ifs, its time to learn how to properly use the tools you have already, and we want you to learn from our combat veteran staff. They are dedicated to providing every client with the same knowledge, skills, and confidence that unarguably was responsible for their return from and Iraq and Afghanistan. Course Breakdown:♠ Private In-Home Tactical Self Defense:• Threat assessment abilities and making the choice fight or hide.• Family communication before, during and after a crisis.• Deadly force vs debilitating/crippling options if you’re forced to defend your self or others.• How to ""stack-up"" (if with your partner/roommate) or fundamentals of room clearance tactics and pieing corners training. Developing into clearing the house with proper strait line /button hook entry and corner to border sector clearance while moving room to room through the home.• What to do when the threat has been neutralized.• What to do with your family members if you must use deadly force.♠ HOME THREAT ASSESSMENT:• Full, on site home assessment: floor plans and • A complete survey of your home and surrounding exterior perimeter areas including current lights, locks, entry/exit points.• Review family safety, security and evacuation plans.• Review of physical security devices, including doors, windows, and safes as to determine where and hope to improve safety.• Examination of common security vulnerabilities.• Identify areas of risk by locating and inspecting vulnerabilities enabling us to provide a breakdown of weak points throughout current security. • Provide a breakdown of what is needed to bring current conditions to a comfortable level. Included with these recommendations (which could include lighting, camera, motion sensors, and more) you will receive a quote for the installation of these services and items.♠ M-16/AR-15 Familiarization ♠ General Rifle/Pistol/Carbine/Shotgun♠ Advanced Rifle/Pistol/Carbine/Shotgun
If you cant donate any funds that is ok, you can still help me reach my goals! Please take the short time to share this campaign with your Family, your phone book,  your email contacts, Facebook friends and anyone else you can. Getting the word out to the people i cant reach on my own is the surest way to reaching my goal.

I'm Jen and I own Retro Daddio--an awesome pop culture and music store in Williamsburg, VA. We ran an Indiegogo campaign that ended a month-ish ago and we raised about $2000 of the $25,000 that we were looking for, so we're running part two to try to get the rest of what we need.</p>
<p>I opened Retro Daddio in October 2013 after operating as an online store since the summer of 2010. At the time I started the online store, I was working a full-time-six-night-a-week job, a part-time-three-day-a-week job, finishing my degree, and I had a husband, two dogs, two cats, a mortgage...and no sleep. Or time with my husband. Or time for anything else. So we started the business with the idea that eventually we'd move into a brick and mortar location and be able to work together, bring our dogs to work, etc. Awesome plan, right? It was! Until one of the dogs died. And then Ralph went into the hospital having seizures and died six weeks later. Needless to say, I made no huge decisions for a year and waited a year and a half before deciding to sell the house, give away most of my stuff and start driving back to Virginia after eight years in Las Vegas to take the huge leap into retail-land. So my mom and pop shop became a mom and dog shop. And then my dog died of bone cancer(it was a rough couple years). So my mom and dog shop became a mom shop...<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <p>The store is doing well and sales are improving all the time, but I need a business loan to consolidate outstanding debt, get in a few new fixtures, bring in some new product lines including vintage-look/rockabilly clothing, more band tees, etc (we've already brought in the games and gaming supplies that we talked about in the last campaign and that are mentioned in the video!) I also work a variety of sci-fi conventions as a vendor and would like to get a used cargo van to haul my merchandise and fixtures in rather than having to worry about things getting ruined every time I go through a rainstorm or stolen if I pull into a rest area.<br/></p>
<p>I've been working with my banker for over a year to get a Small Business Administration loan and have been told that they think I'm an excellent candidate, BUT I have to come up with $15,000 to put up against what they're willing to give me before I can get the disbursement.  We raised about $2,000 in the last campaign between online and in-store contributions, and I just found that they'll count my IRA toward that total as well, so we're actually almost halfway there!</p>
<p>We have a bunch of perks that you can receive in exchange for your support, so check those out and see if any of them appeal to you. Some of them are similar to the ones we offered in the previous campaign and some are totally new.<br/></p>
</div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <p>The bottom line is that I'm doing...okay, but the loan will make things SO MUCH less stressful--and will eliminate the added stress of the off-season sales plummet that happens every winter. Oh! And I'd actually be able to take a small salary for the first time in two years! And maybe hire a part-time employee so I can take a day off once a week! <br/></p>
<p>So that's what the loan will do for me/the store. Here's what the store does for Williamsburg;</p>
<p>We give a LOT in donations to local events, charities, causes, etc.--both financial donations and in-kind donations for door prizes, auctions, etc                              <br/></p>
<p>We showcase the work of several local artists and give them a place to sell their work on consignment.</p>
<p>We provide a place for schools, churches, conventions, groups, the public library, and other small businesses to post flyers, posters, leave business cards for others to pick up, etc</p>
<p>We provide a space for gamers to gather and play board, card, and role playing games and for local groups to meet completely free of charge</p>
<p>We've hosted fundraisers for Heritage Humane Society and we're a pet friendly store, so no one has to leave their pet outside to come in and shop or hang out</p>
</div><div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <p>Not everyone wants to or CAN donate--I totally get that. We're also running other forms of fundraising, with all funds going to the same goal. Raffles through our Facebook page, a change jar on the counter, entering grant competitions, selling on eBay and Amazon, vending at as many conventions as I can afford space at--you name it, I'm trying it. I'm also working on a Kickstarter to pre-sell some cool t-shirts--that will be launching soon.</p>
<p>You can also help by just spreading the word, sharing the link to the campaign, and helping us raise our GoGoFactor. Everything helps get us visibility and it's all appreciated!</p>
<p>You can also send people into the shop at 218 Monticello Avenue, Williamsburg, VA 23185 or send them to our online store at <a href=""https://www.shopretrodaddio.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.shopretrodaddio.com</a> so they can see our awesome offerings from Doctor Who, Star Trek, Star Wars, The Beatles, Monty Python, Harry Potter, and lots more, plus a wide selection of used cds and vinyl records.<br/></p>

We've hosted fundraisers for Heritage Humane Society and we're a pet friendly store, so no one has to leave their pet outside to come in and shop or hang out
 Other Ways You Can Help Not everyone wants to or CAN donate--I totally get that. We're also running other forms of fundraising, with all funds going to the same goal. Raffles through our Facebook page, a change jar on the counter, entering grant competitions, selling on eBay and Amazon, vending at as many conventions as I can afford space at--you name it, I'm trying it. I'm also working on a Kickstarter to pre-sell some cool t-shirts--that will be launching soon.
You can also help by just spreading the word, sharing the link to the campaign, and helping us raise our GoGoFactor. Everything helps get us visibility and it's all appreciated!
You can also send people into the shop at 218 Monticello Avenue, Williamsburg, VA 23185 or send them to our online store at https://www.shopretrodaddio.com so they can see our awesome offerings from Doctor Who, Star Trek, Star Wars, The Beatles, Monty Python, Harry Potter, and lots more, plus a wide selection of used cds and vinyl records.",0.0,0,"2 Campaigns

<p>Our greatest advertising is our customers sharing their experiences after visiting our coffee house. One amazing opportunity that was presented to us was when a customer saw an ad on TV for submissions to be on  <i><b>""Finland's Top Bakery Show"".</b></i> The customer sent an email to the producers and the next thing you know Valkoinen Puu is competing on <b>Season 1</b> of the show. Amazing!! </p>
</div>
<div>Our passion and experience to create such a coffee house finally arrived in June 2011 when Valkoinen Puu (The White Tree) opened its doors in the small town of Kauhajoki Finland. </div>
<div><i>We have been humbly amazed and thankful by the out pouring support from our customers locally and those that travel many hours to experience Valkoinen Puu. We thank you sincerely and we will keep working hard to bring you a wonderful  coffee house experience.</i></div>

Greetings from Mark and Kirsi Heidt!
Owners and creators of Valkoinen Puu!




Sit back and relax and let us share our amazing story with you... because our business is more than just a coffee house. It's an inspiring creation to awaken your every senses through experiencing delicious quality desserts, superior coffees, fresh foods, all in a mood filled setting that once you settle in... you won't want to leave.  Welcome to Valkoinen Puu!


Who We Are 

We are Mark(American)  and Kirsi(Finnish) and our careers involved us working in the interior and ceramic design fields. We moved from the US to Finland in 2007 as our ceramics were selling so well here. We specifically came to open a coffee house that would combine our ceramics and our passion for creating delicious foods, desserts and coffees in an unforgettable cozy setting. 

Our inspiration to create an unforgettable coffee house was this simple thought. If we were traveling anywhere in the world, what type of coffee house would we want to stumble upon? We would want to enter a place that is beautiful, that we would experience with all of our senses. A place that would be cozy with warm customer service. The foods delicious and the desserts and coffees made with love and care. A place where time isn't a thought and new memories are being made. An experience that continues to intensify the longer you stay. When it is time to go you are completely satisfied and leave with a sigh and a thought  of ""Wow! that was great!""


Some of our Desserts- Fresh, home made from scratch, with the finest ingredients
  

  
  

Our greatest advertising is our customers sharing their experiences after visiting our coffee house. One amazing opportunity that was presented to us was when a customer saw an ad on TV for submissions to be on  ""Finland's Top Bakery Show"". The customer sent an email to the producers and the next thing you know Valkoinen Puu is competing on Season 1 of the show. Amazing!! 

Our passion and experience to create such a coffee house finally arrived in June 2011 when Valkoinen Puu (The White Tree) opened its doors in the small town of Kauhajoki Finland. 
We have been humbly amazed and thankful by the out pouring support from our customers locally and those that travel many hours to experience Valkoinen Puu. We thank you sincerely and we will keep working hard to bring you a wonderful  coffee house experience.
Warmest regards,
Mark, Kirsi and the Valkoinen Puu team!

* ""The World's Best Coffee House"" is quoted from many of our customers




Our Campaign
Our company is a small business. A husband and wife team creating delicious cakes and foods for our coffee house. We also design and make our own ceramic collection lines.

Some of our Ceramics- Hand made, hand painted, food, oven & dishwasher safe


    

  







Our campaign goal of 50,000 dollars is to be used to purchase the necessary equipment, furniture and supplies to open a second cafe in a much larger neighboring town of Seinäjoki, Finland. The justification for another cafe is simple, our customers demands. We have been asked to open cafes in multiple cities throughout Finland, Helsinki being the biggest. A second cafe brings us the greatest monetary return for our business for reinvestment. 

Some of our Foods- Freshly made and prepared to order

What is HOBY?
Hugh O’Brian Youth Leadership
(HOBY) is a non-profit organization that was started in 1958 by celebrity actor, Hugh O’Brian.
 The mission of HOBY is to inspire and develop our global community of
youth and volunteers to a life dedicated to leadership, service and innovation.  The vision of HOBY is to motivate and empower individuals to make a positive
difference within our global society, through understanding and action, based
on effective and compassionate leadership.HOBY Georgia is run by all volunteers who give countless hours throughout the year to provide life-changing experiences for several hundred high school sophomores from all over the state every spring in two seminars: GA Northwest and GA Southeast.
Learn more about HOBY Georgia at www.gahoby.org.
You can help us make a difference!
It takes
over $50,000 to run our two HOBY Georgia seminars each year, and we
are putting forth a large fundraising effort this year to ensure HOBY Georgia
is sustainable in the future.  Our goal with the $5 Alumni Challenge
is to raise $5,000 for the 2016 seminars, and to start a culture of alumni giving back to the organization they love.  We hope you'll contribute!

<p><b>The Goal</b></p>
<p>We are witnessing a refugee crisis that is Europe's biggest
since World War II. Almost 4 million people have fled Syria since the start of
the conflict, most of them women and children. It is one of the largest refugee
exoduses in history. But this is not just Europe's responsibility. </p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">These are people with lives and families and careers who
are facing a choice that none of us can imagine. Putting their children on
boats, acting out of desperation, all with the goal of getting somewhere safe.
Anywhere safe. Their country has been ravaged by a war that has been going on
so long that many Syrian children don't know any different. Poverty, fear,
starvation and violence is all that they have ever known.</span></p>
<p>If you are like me, you are reading about families suffocating
on trucks, and drowned toddlers washing up on beaches and you're feeling
heartbroken and helpless. </p>
<p>I, like so
many others that I know, want to do something. But it is expensive to get a
family relocated here to Toronto, and on their feet. </p>
<p>The minimum cost to help
relocate a family of 4 through Lifeline Syria* is $27,000. </p>
<p>When I saw that
number I was disheartened. I don't know anyone who has that much money to
donate in a lump sum. But I can contribute some money and I know a lot of
others who are willing to do the same. If we come together collectively, we can
make it happen. We can change a family's entire life and path, as well as the
path of their children. </p>
<p><br/>
<b>What We
Need &amp; What You Get</b></p>
<p><br/>
Lifeline Syria recommends that groups come together to sponsor a family. Partly because, finances aside, the family will need other kinds of support. Time is a big one.
The family will need orientation and emotional support, they will need
assistance with finding employment, navigating transportation systems, making
health connections and registering for school.</p>
<p>
This crowd-funding site is one small way to contribute to us reaching
this goal and helping a family directly by getting them here to Toronto. This
campaign will run alongside fundraising events to help us further reach our
goal.</p>
<p><br/>
<b>The Impact</b></p>
<p><br/>
It goes without saying that the direct impact to improve valuable lives is
immeasurable. And it will be the result of a grassroots movement, which is
a beautiful thing. </p>
<p><br/>
<b>Risks &amp;
Challenges</b></p>
<p>I will be
completely transparent about the fact that I'm scared to take this on. This is
a huge target. It will take a lot people and time and contributions to reach
this goal. But I'm an optimist and I refuse to be daunted by the number. This
is not an impossible goal.</p>
<p>All of that
said, if we can't achieve the target number, all of the funds raised will be
donated to <a href=""http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/our-work/humanitarian-issues/refugees-and-idps"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><span></span></a><a href=""http://www.msf.ca/"">Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) International</a>, or Doctors
