<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>A growing number of people around the world are exploring or thinking of exploring consensual non-monogamy (CNM), that is having multiple romantic and/or sexual relationships with the active consent of all concerned. </p>
<p>Former BBC journalist Jonathan Kent has written a comprehensive introduction to the subject that surveys the different styles of CNM, the pitfalls, the skills needed to avoid them and the challenges of being consensually non-monogamous in a world still largely wired for monogamy. </p>
<p><strong>Why this book?</strong></p>
<p>A World Beyond Monogamy is an exhaustively researched look at open relationships, swinging and polyamory that draws on some fifty interviews with people across the world in non-monogamous relationships and on the expertise of psychologists, historians, philosophers and evolutionary biologists. What he has produced offers a profound insight into love and intimacy outside the mainstream, shaped by the advice, experience and expertise of those who have been in the vanguard of a growing community of people who are questioning the relationship scripts that we're expected to follow.</p>
<p>In doing so he's managed to break free of the limitations of previous books on the subject - many of them very personal accounts, overwhelmingly from liberal enclaves in North America, that offer a narrow window onto a much wider world.</p>
<p> <i>A World Beyond Monogamy</i> doesn't evangelise for CNM and has little truck with those who claim that consensual non-monogamy is somehow more 'enlightened'. Nor does it suggest that there is a ""right"" way to do it. What it does evangelise for is consent, choice and a willingness to rethink the way we're told to do relationships, both monogamous and non-monogamous.</p>
<p>Three years in the making it also talks about how people in traditional monogamous relationships can learn from and apply the hard-won lessons of people in non-monogamous relationships, that all relationships can benefit from better communication, a willingness to negotiate constructively and to wrap relationship structures around individuals rather than vice verse,  hence the subtitle: <i>How people make polyamory and open relationships work and what we can all learn from them.</i></p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
A growing number of people around the world are exploring or thinking of exploring consensual non-monogamy (CNM), that is having multiple romantic and/or sexual relationships with the active consent of all concerned. 
Former BBC journalist Jonathan Kent has written a comprehensive introduction to the subject that surveys the different styles of CNM, the pitfalls, the skills needed to avoid them and the challenges of being consensually non-monogamous in a world still largely wired for monogamy. 
Why this book?
A World Beyond Monogamy is an exhaustively researched look at open relationships, swinging and polyamory that draws on some fifty interviews with people across the world in non-monogamous relationships and on the expertise of psychologists, historians, philosophers and evolutionary biologists. What he has produced offers a profound insight into love and intimacy outside the mainstream, shaped by the advice, experience and expertise of those who have been in the vanguard of a growing community of people who are questioning the relationship scripts that we're expected to follow.
In doing so he's managed to break free of the limitations of previous books on the subject - many of them very personal accounts, overwhelmingly from liberal enclaves in North America, that offer a narrow window onto a much wider world.
 A World Beyond Monogamy doesn't evangelise for CNM and has little truck with those who claim that consensual non-monogamy is somehow more 'enlightened'. Nor does it suggest that there is a ""right"" way to do it. What it does evangelise for is consent, choice and a willingness to rethink the way we're told to do relationships, both monogamous and non-monogamous.
Three years in the making it also talks about how people in traditional monogamous relationships can learn from and apply the hard-won lessons of people in non-monogamous relationships, that all relationships can benefit from better communication, a willingness to negotiate constructively and to wrap relationship structures around individuals rather than vice verse,  hence the subtitle: How people make polyamory and open relationships work and what we can all learn from them.
Why me?
I am a journalist, broadcaster and writer. I’ve been a foreign correspondent and apolitical reporter for the BBC, Reuters, Newsweek, The Daily Telegraph, KQED, and The Guardian. I wrote, produced and presented the BBC Radio 4 series ‘Our Daily Bread’.
I bring my experience as a reporter and correspondent to a what I hope is a thoughtful, balanced, and meticulously researched book that passes the mic to others who together give a frank, intimate, raw, occasionally funny and, above all, wise take on the joys, the pitfalls and the challenges of maintaining multiple relationships as well as the skills that help make it work.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>All About Change: How to Successfully Make Personal Life Changes</i> is all about change and how to make it successfully. Change is a skill that you can hone so that life changes are no longer something to fear or avoid. You will read stories from my own life and the lives of others given as examples of changes made great and poorly. You will welcome change once you learn the techniques in this book.<br/><br/>My name is Sarah Carter and I am the author of <i>All About Change: How to Successfully Make Personal Life Changes</i>. I wrote this book because life is full of exciting changes that can bring so much joy to your life if you don’t avoid or rush through them. I found that many of my coaching clients were stuck not because they didn’t want to make change but because they didn’t know how, so they were avoiding it. Once they saw change as a skill and as an opportunity, they grew and moved forward towards who they always dreamed they could become.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how viewing change as a skill is the key to unlocking success and lasting joy in your life. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for welcoming change. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you shape your life through the changes you choose.</p>
<p>In this book, you'll learn about goal setting and values. You'll hear stories such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How Dan changed jobs so he could be a better father and husband. The key to successfully achieving that goal was learning to measure better.</li>
<li>How Dayana identified her personal values and chose change opportunities that came her way to stay true to those values.</li>
<li>How Jerry decided to make the big life change of retirement and then had to change again because he didn’t have a clear vision.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are stuck resisting change, looking for a path to becoming who you ultimately want to be, or striving to harness every opportunity that you encounter.<br/><br/><i>All About Change: How to Successfully Make Personal Life Changes</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to those joining the job force, those leaving it, and everyone in between who want to look at change and personal values in a new way.</p>

<h3>Dear Friends, Family &amp; Colleagues, and Race Healer Community,</h3>
<p>For those of you who do not know me, I am Milagros Phillips, the author of <i>CRACKING THE HEALER'S CODE: A Prescription for Healing Racism and Finding Wholeness. </i>This book has been 20 years in the making, carries more than 30 years of experience doing healing racism work, and details the 12 stages of healing that have been so powerful for the thousands who have gone through this process. </p>
<p>I created this campaign because I need your assistance in getting the book published and in the hands of a country--indeed a world--that is sorely in need of racial healing. I coalesced the information, did the writing, and now need your help to get it out into the world. In my workshops, I always speak of the importance of doing race work in community, and the power of what we can do together. I need your support to get this life-transforming information to the world, that we may heal from our racial conditioning as one human family. </p>
<p>Your contributions are the final chapter in this book. </p>
<p><i>CRACKING THE HEALER'S CODE: A Prescription for Healing Racism and Finding Wholeness</i> is a book that provides the historical context of our internalized racial conditioning, gives us a roadmap for healing, and empowers us to claim our right to wholeness.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how each of us was conditioned through a divisive caste system, violence, and trauma over hundreds of years into the condition we call racism. I hope this book instills in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for healing from racial conditioning and finding wholeness. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you heal and join the beautiful diversity of our one human family.<br/><br/>You'll learn about the history that got us to where we are today: a history that goes beyond the middle passage and slavery and a caste system established by the Spaniards one hundred years before the Mayflower landed in the continental USA and the difference that healing can make.</p>
<p>You'll learn from stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>A White woman who was able to establish a relationship with her father as a result of this healing work, whose views on race were very different from hers.</li>
<li>A Black woman who thought she had nothing new to learn about being Black in America, who got an education she didn’t know she needed.</li>
<li>A White man who thought he was helping because his money helped repair a tennis club for children, but failed to learn the first lesson of serving in a Black community.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you...</p>
<ul>
<li><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Want to learn the real reason people are racist (it’s not what you think)</span></li>
<li>Want to understand and change your own racial conditioning</li>
<li>Are ready to heal from racism</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><i>CRACKING THE HEALER'S CODE: A Prescription for Healing Racism and Finding Wholeness</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to audiences of all skin colors, and all adult ages who want to understand the context of our racial conditioning, and are ready to look at this myth we call race in a new way.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<p><u>THIS BOOK IS DIVIDED INTO 4 PARTS:</u><br/><br/><strong>PART 1</strong> (introduction + chapters 1-17) prepares the reader for the journey and includes chapters that explain healing, history, how racism was institutionalized, how latitude affects attitude, and the five dimensions of racial conditioning.<br/><br/><i>Consider this: </i>When it comes to race and racism, healing is tending to the condition caused by 500-years of racial conditioning. But inroads are being made. In 2019 several US counties declared racism a public health crisis.<br/><br/>A condition (according to the Oxford dictionary) is:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>The circumstances affecting the way in which people live or work, especially with regard to their safety or well-being.</i></li>
<li><i>The process of training or accustoming a person or animal to behave in a certain way or to accept certain circumstances.</i></li>
</ul>
<p>Racism is a condition that affects the entire human race--the whole human family. Everywhere that “Western Civilization” has touched, it has left the violent scar of racism.</p>
<p>So, who needs healing? The human family.</p>
<p>If we were to look at the condition of racism through the lens of addiction, we might start treating it differently. While addictions such as alcohol-ism are now regarded as a medical condition, race-ism is a social ill, affecting millions worldwide.</p>
<p>Where there’s racism, there is psychological, and physical violence and abuse, at times leading to death as we see in the case of many African and Black Americans and people of color all over the world. As happens in families dealing with an alcoholic, one member of the family with an addiction affects the entire family. Therefore, the entire family needs to be treated. In other words, we, members of the human family, all need healing from racism.</p>
<p>So what is healing?<br/><br/><strong>PART 2</strong> (chapters 18-23) describes the Healer’s Code. It gives the reader a glimpse of how it was developed and how it helps, and covers a part of healing rarely discussed, that of the healing crisis.<br/><br/>We are ONE HUMAN FAMILY, and we all need healing from racism.</p>
<p>No amount of racial conditioning can change the reality that we are one human family with all functions and dysfunctions that we find in individual families. When it comes to healing from racism we are each responsible for our own transformation. No one can heal for you, nor can you afford to wait for others to change to improve your life. You are worthy of healing now. Healing is the path to wholeness, something that racism takes away from all of us.<br/><br/>You are a whole human, mind, body, spirit, and emotions, which means that you will need to heal your racial conditioning at all levels. You deserve to claim your wholeness, not tomorrow, or someday, you are worthy of your wholeness now! The great news is that no matter what has happened in your life, your wholeness is still intact waiting for you to remove what keeps you from experiencing it. Your wholeness holds the truth of who you are, your gifts, your power, your beauty, your grace, and in spite of it all...your innocence.<br/><br/><strong>PART 3</strong> (chapters 24-26) is only two chapters but is actually the longest part of the book. It divides the Healer’s Code into three parts for ease and understanding. These three parts contain the components of the healing process. For instance, Part 1 of the Healer’s Code (the healing process) looks at INNOCENCE, IGNORANCE, and AWAKENING. Here is an excerpt:<br/><br/><i>People don’t know what they don’t know, but learning is required for a new consciousness to develop. In a world full of information, innocence cannot be an excuse for ignorance. Black people and people of color have never been asleep at the wheel of racism, they could not afford to be. Their safety was at stake. White people, however, live in a comparatively different world, and many have trouble understanding the experiences of people who are not White.<br/><br/>To be White means that you don’t have to think about race or racism. Your supremacist conditioning means that you decide when, where, and on what terms you will interact with people of color. Being White means that you don’t have to think about how your skin color will impact your world on a daily basis. It means that if you commit a crime you will be seen as innocent and have to be proven guilty, as opposed to being seen as guilty and you have to prove your innocence. In situations where there is an absence of proof of guilt, the accused character is attacked ad nauseam.<br/><br/>Black children and children of color are born into a racial caste system that is set against them from the beginning. The loss of innocence happens early and the continual racial stress and racial trauma are relentless, causing life-course stress that may well be related to stress-related illnesses.

</div></div>","Dear Friends, Family & Colleagues, and Race Healer Community,
For those of you who do not know me, I am Milagros Phillips, the author of CRACKING THE HEALER'S CODE: A Prescription for Healing Racism and Finding Wholeness. This book has been 20 years in the making, carries more than 30 years of experience doing healing racism work, and details the 12 stages of healing that have been so powerful for the thousands who have gone through this process. 
I created this campaign because I need your assistance in getting the book published and in the hands of a country--indeed a world--that is sorely in need of racial healing. I coalesced the information, did the writing, and now need your help to get it out into the world. In my workshops, I always speak of the importance of doing race work in community, and the power of what we can do together. I need your support to get this life-transforming information to the world, that we may heal from our racial conditioning as one human family. 
Your contributions are the final chapter in this book. 
CRACKING THE HEALER'S CODE: A Prescription for Healing Racism and Finding Wholeness is a book that provides the historical context of our internalized racial conditioning, gives us a roadmap for healing, and empowers us to claim our right to wholeness.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how each of us was conditioned through a divisive caste system, violence, and trauma over hundreds of years into the condition we call racism. I hope this book instills in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for healing from racial conditioning and finding wholeness. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you heal and join the beautiful diversity of our one human family.You'll learn about the history that got us to where we are today: a history that goes beyond the middle passage and slavery and a caste system established by the Spaniards one hundred years before the Mayflower landed in the continental USA and the difference that healing can make.
You'll learn from stories such as...

A White woman who was able to establish a relationship with her father as a result of this healing work, whose views on race were very different from hers.
A Black woman who thought she had nothing new to learn about being Black in America, who got an education she didn’t know she needed.
A White man who thought he was helping because his money helped repair a tennis club for children, but failed to learn the first lesson of serving in a Black community.

You will love this book if you...

Want to learn the real reason people are racist (it’s not what you think)
Want to understand and change your own racial conditioning
Are ready to heal from racism

 
CRACKING THE HEALER'S CODE: A Prescription for Healing Racism and Finding Wholeness is a nonfiction book that speaks to audiences of all skin colors, and all adult ages who want to understand the context of our racial conditioning, and are ready to look at this myth we call race in a new way.
 

THIS BOOK IS DIVIDED INTO 4 PARTS:PART 1 (introduction + chapters 1-17) prepares the reader for the journey and includes chapters that explain healing, history, how racism was institutionalized, how latitude affects attitude, and the five dimensions of racial conditioning.Consider this: When it comes to race and racism, healing is tending to the condition caused by 500-years of racial conditioning. But inroads are being made. In 2019 several US counties declared racism a public health crisis.A condition (according to the Oxford dictionary) is:

The circumstances affecting the way in which people live or work, especially with regard to their safety or well-being.
The process of training or accustoming a person or animal to behave in a certain way or to accept certain circumstances.

Racism is a condition that affects the entire human race--the whole human family. Everywhere that “Western Civilization” has touched, it has left the violent scar of racism.
So, who needs healing? The human family.
If we were to look at the condition of racism through the lens of addiction, we might start treating it differently. While addictions such as alcohol-ism are now regarded as a medical condition, race-ism is a social ill, affecting millions worldwide.
Where there’s racism, there is psychological, and physical violence and abuse, at times leading to death as we see in the case of many African and Black Americans and people of color all over the world. As happens in families dealing with an alcoholic, one member of the family with an addiction affects the entire family. Therefore, the entire family needs to be treated. In other words, we, members of the human family, all need healing from racism.
So what is healing?PART 2 (chapters 18-23) describes the Healer’s Code. It gives the reader a glimpse of how it was developed and how it helps, and covers a part of healing rarely discussed, that of the healing crisis.We are ONE HUMAN FAMILY, and we all need healing from racism.
No amount of racial conditioning can change the reality that we are one human family with all functions and dysfunctions that we find in individual families. When it comes to healing from racism we are each responsible for our own transformation. No one can heal for you, nor can you afford to wait for others to change to improve your life. You are worthy of healing now. Healing is the path to wholeness, something that racism takes away from all of us.You are a whole human, mind, body, spirit, and emotions, which means that you will need to heal your racial conditioning at all levels. You deserve to claim your wholeness, not tomorrow, or someday, you are worthy of your wholeness now! The great news is that no matter what has happened in your life, your wholeness is still intact waiting for you to remove what keeps you from experiencing it. Your wholeness holds the truth of who you are, your gifts, your power, your beauty, your grace, and in spite of it all...your innocence.PART 3 (chapters 24-26) is only two chapters but is actually the longest part of the book. It divides the Healer’s Code into three parts for ease and understanding. These three parts contain the components of the healing process. For instance, Part 1 of the Healer’s Code (the healing process) looks at INNOCENCE, IGNORANCE, and AWAKENING. Here is an excerpt:People don’t know what they don’t know, but learning is required for a new consciousness to develop. In a world full of information, innocence cannot be an excuse for ignorance. Black people and people of color have never been asleep at the wheel of racism, they could not afford to be. Their safety was at stake. White people, however, live in a comparatively different world, and many have trouble understanding the experiences of people who are not White.To be White means that you don’t have to think about race or racism. Your supremacist conditioning means that you decide when, where, and on what terms you will interact with people of color. Being White means that you don’t have to think about how your skin color will impact your world on a daily basis. It means that if you commit a crime you will be seen as innocent and have to be proven guilty, as opposed to being seen as guilty and you have to prove your innocence. In situations where there is an absence of proof of guilt, the accused character is attacked ad nauseam.Black children and children of color are born into a racial caste system that is set against them from the beginning. The loss of innocence happens early and the continual racial stress and racial trauma are relentless, causing life-course stress that may well be related to stress-related illnesses. So what is innocence and how does one lose it when it comes to race?Altogether, there are 12 stages to the Healer’s Code.PART 4 (chapters 27-29) holds the key to the Healer’s Code. It connects the dots, revealing what healing does to individuals, and holds a vision of what it can do for the world. This part contains testimonials from those whose lives have been changed by the Healer’s Code, the conclusion, and practices for staying on the path of racial healing.

When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition and an audiobook.I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:

<h3>Adventure Rocks!</h3>
<p>Rock music and sci-fi/fantasy go hand in hand. The big secret is that <i>musicians are huge nerds</i>. 60s icons like Pink Floyd and Jimi Hendrix were known fantasy, sci-fi, and comic book geeks. 70s prog titans like Rush, Yes, Blue Öyster Cult, and King Crimson were heavily inspired by the tales of adventure and exploration. No one can forget 80s and 90s power-metal groups like Iron Maiden, Dream Theater and Queensrÿche, or speed and death metal groups like Blind Illusion, Iced Earth, and Amon Amarth, whose imaginations were heavily fueled by written tales of adventure and excitement. Modern hard rock and metal is full of such influence as well; for example, every Coheed &amp; Cambira album is a chapter in a larger sci-fi space opera. The spirit lives on!</p>
<p>Go back further, though. Richard Wagner wrote entire operas based on folk legend. Other notable composers like Gluck, Monteverdi, and Handel, among others, composed operas inspired by classical Greek and Roman mythology.</p>
<p>So it's only natural that this influence goes the other way. I'm proud to present to you <i>Pulp Rock</i>: Ten tales of adventure, danger, intrigue, horror and FUN inspired by bands, musicians, artists, and composers. </p>
<p>Some of these tales involve music. Others musicians. Some involve settings, scenes, and characters inspired by music. All are killer, and <strong><i>exclusive to this anthology</i>.</strong> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Roster</h3>
<p><i>Pulp Rock</i> will feature stories from ten luminaries in the independent fiction scene:</p>

<p>""The Devil's Harp,"" by David J. West: Salt Lake City, 1861: A traveling diva is shot amidst her performance and her harp is stolen. Porter Rockwell hunts for the would-be assassin and stolen heirloom, but the trail is perplexing. Mark Twain offers clues to what may be an occult crime and even darker past indiscretion.</p>
<p>""Mad Wind,"" by JD Cowan: Noise pollution still kills, even in the future! What can one alien visitor do against the power of the Mad Wind? He must seek out a band with the ability to combat the invisible force, or face certain death.</p>
<p>""Bold as Color,"" by Alexander Nader: Have you ever wanted to see music? I’m not just talking some hip “the music comes alive for me” BS, I mean to literally SEE music. Listen, I came up with this formula…What? The metal show? Oh….You heard about that, huh? Listen those metal heads weren’t my fault. They took too much. The side effects? Minimal. What’s that? Exploding heads? Okay, that was a one off thing. Here, just sit down and I’ll tell you from the start. </p>
<p>""Princess of the Night,"" by Paul McKesley: The Hind's Heart was a relic of Old Earth and an heirloom of the extinct Freeland family that once ruled the sector. For Bron Freeland, it was his birthright, and he would do anything to get it back, even stealing it from a heavily guarded Royal escort aboard a luxury cruiser. Every diamond has a price, though, and sneaking onto the Princess of the Night would turn out to be much easier than leaving it.</p>
<p>""Altered Egos,"" by Patrick Walts: A long-forgotten 1980s hard rock juggernaut stages a triumphant return to the limelight with an unexpected hit record and stadium tour. Is it the same band that dominated the charts in the decade of excess, or did imposters steal their thunder . . . and their profits.""</p>
<p>""Keep it Burning Bright,"" by Alexander Hellene: Explorer Gan Swift has seen all the hidden, unknown places the world has to offer . . . except one. When his wife and daughter die a few years into his retirement, Gan decides to strike out for that one corner of the globe that's remained untouched. With nothing left to live for, Gan and his band of pioneers take off for one final adventure to where the ancient texts say it all began . . .</p>

<h3>The Need</h3>
<p>I'm looking to raise $2,000 for this project. The breakdown is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>$900 to pay my writers (I'm not taking a paycheck for this one)</li>
<li>$800 for cover art by Manuel Guzman (<a href=""http://lolosart.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">LolosArt.com</a>), the super-talented cover artist of my <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08HSD8LJ4?ref_=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_tkin&amp;binding=kindle_edition"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Swordbringer series</a>.</li>
<li>$300 for formatting</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Stretch Goals</h3>
<p>For every $200 raised beyond the initial $2,000, the amazing Jesse White will provide an illustration for the book. Jesse is a wonderful artist who painted the cover for my book <a href=""https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08MVYKX4X/ref=dbs_a_def_rwt_bibl_vppi_i3"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><i>Dreamers &amp; Misfits: The Definitive Book About Rush Fans</i></a>.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest risk of this campaign not succeeding is this anthology not happening. I really want to pay my writers for their hard work, and if the campaign does not raise the funds sought, they'll either have to be paid less, or not at all . . . or out of my pocket, which would delay things further. This is to say nothing about the cover.</p>
<p>But I want to produce a high-quality, professional package<strong><i> FOR YOU</i></strong>, the reader, and also for posterity. We need to make as many cultural artifacts we can of new, original, and fresh works that capture the zeitgeist of the times. And have some fun doing it. </p>
<p>So please contribute, and if you can't, please spread the word. This is going to ROCK.</p>

<h3>Story of My Book </h3>My name is Brian Asingia and I am the author of Cashless Society 101. I wrote this book to explore the intersection between Data, A.I and Society, and how individuals, public and private institutions can do right in a world that normalizes and rewards unethical leadership and exclusive innovation. My goal is to help others find a moral compass in the fourth industrial revolution. This will help the reader navigate moral dilemmas around ethical leadership and inclusive innovation through the four pillar values of Identity, Ownership, Trust, and Scale.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that people are hired in technology companies without the proper or timely training to understand the ethical and value transfer consequences of the increasingly complex and automated systems they design and operate. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for Ethics in a Cashless Society. Dalporto warns that, “If you tried to reskill a billion people in the university system, you would break the university system.” Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to show that because humans create technology, we need to be skeptical of it and work to make it more effective and less biased.<br/><br/>The coolest story I share in this book is Dr. Jose Morey, NASA, White House, Hyperloop Advisor and Forbes Innovation Expert. His greatest accomplishment is founding Ad Astra Media to Bring STEAM to students through space comics and animations that look like them, underpinning the increasing lack of identity representation in science and technology as well as media.<br/><br/>My hope for this book is helping us understand how both as a society and individually we can do better and keep fighting for an ethical and inclusive future, an ethical and inclusive Cashless Society. You will learn:<p>About Cashless Society as a philosophy, a cashless values based exchange</p>
<p>Why Cashless Society is an ideal technocratic realization that technology is neutral but humans are not</p>
<p>How we can create room for Ethics or Values Based Leadership and Inclusive Innovation in the Fourth Industrial Revolution</p>
<br/>You will love / enjoy this book if you are:<p>In your 20s to 30s seeking to find your own moral compass beyond groupthink lenses of today</p>
<p>An executive or emerging leader anxious about the unknown and how to lead or listen</p>
<p>Someone who values the power of individual agency and accountability</p>Cashless Society 101 is a nonfiction book that speaks to lifelong student innovators and emerging leaders who want to look at Ethical Leadership and Inclusive Innovation in a new way.<p> </p>
<h3>The Book - CASHLESS SOCIETY 101</h3>
<p><br/>The book is written in three parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-3. The book shows how we got here. We explore how technology throughout history has been neutral and it is human behavior and values that are often in need of reflection and adjustment. The value of Ethical Leadership is explored through cash’s relation to greed and Cashless Society defined as a philosophy and technocratic ideal. The author argues that “Technology, though neutral, is a tool for progress towards a better cashless society.”<br/><br/>Part 2 contains chapters 5-8. Principles of ethical innovators and technologists are explored through well researched examples from around the world and the roles of IDENTITY, OWNERSHIP, TRUST and SCALE highlighted. The author shares that “The West takes other cultures and their contributions for granted while the rest of the world is fighting to decolonize innovation.”<br/><br/>Part 3 contains chapters 9-11. The reader is guided on how to drive ethical innovation and technology via a shared value and individual agency moral compass for both individuals and institutions, while exploring the lifelong impacts of automation, data, A.I and society in a Cashless Society. The author shares how “Humans now learn, work, think and act as a herd via group think.” According to the Wall Street Journal, “The business world has become the business of ethics.”<br/><br/>Part 4: contains chapter 12. This is a list of backer-submitted questions from the author’s experience, advisory sessions, workshops and keynotes that will foster thoughtful and meaningful conversations on the role we can each play in advocating for, creating, realizing, and sustaining an ethical and inclusive Cashless Society.<br/> </p>

I wrote this book to explore the intersection between Data, A.I and Society, and how individuals, public and private institutions can do right in a world that normalizes and rewards unethical leadership and exclusive innovation. My goal is to help others find a moral compass in the fourth industrial revolution. This will help the reader navigate moral dilemmas around ethical leadership and inclusive innovation through the four pillar values of Identity, Ownership, Trust, and Scale.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that people are hired in technology companies without the proper or timely training to understand the ethical and value transfer consequences of the increasingly complex and automated systems they design and operate. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for Ethics in a Cashless Society. Dalporto warns that, “If you tried to reskill a billion people in the university system, you would break the university system.” Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to show that because humans create technology, we need to be skeptical of it and work to make it more effective and less biased.The coolest story I share in this book is Dr. Jose Morey, NASA, White House, Hyperloop Advisor and Forbes Innovation Expert. His greatest accomplishment is founding Ad Astra Media to Bring STEAM to students through space comics and animations that look like them, underpinning the increasing lack of identity representation in science and technology as well as media.My hope for this book is helping us understand how both as a society and individually we can do better and keep fighting for an ethical and inclusive future, an ethical and inclusive Cashless Society. You will learn:About Cashless Society as a philosophy, a cashless values based exchange
Why Cashless Society is an ideal technocratic realization that technology is neutral but humans are not
How we can create room for Ethics or Values Based Leadership and Inclusive Innovation in the Fourth Industrial Revolution
You will love / enjoy this book if you are:In your 20s to 30s seeking to find your own moral compass beyond groupthink lenses of today
An executive or emerging leader anxious about the unknown and how to lead or listen
Someone who values the power of individual agency and accountabilityCashless Society 101 is a nonfiction book that speaks to lifelong student innovators and emerging leaders who want to look at Ethical Leadership and Inclusive Innovation in a new way. 
The Book - CASHLESS SOCIETY 101
The book is written in three parts.Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-3. The book shows how we got here. We explore how technology throughout history has been neutral and it is human behavior and values that are often in need of reflection and adjustment. The value of Ethical Leadership is explored through cash’s relation to greed and Cashless Society defined as a philosophy and technocratic ideal. The author argues that “Technology, though neutral, is a tool for progress towards a better cashless society.”Part 2 contains chapters 5-8. Principles of ethical innovators and technologists are explored through well researched examples from around the world and the roles of IDENTITY, OWNERSHIP, TRUST and SCALE highlighted. The author shares that “The West takes other cultures and their contributions for granted while the rest of the world is fighting to decolonize innovation.”Part 3 contains chapters 9-11. The reader is guided on how to drive ethical innovation and technology via a shared value and individual agency moral compass for both individuals and institutions, while exploring the lifelong impacts of automation, data, A.I and society in a Cashless Society. The author shares how “Humans now learn, work, think and act as a herd via group think.” According to the Wall Street Journal, “The business world has become the business of ethics.”Part 4: contains chapter 12. This is a list of backer-submitted questions from the author’s experience, advisory sessions, workshops and keynotes that will foster thoughtful and meaningful conversations on the role we can each play in advocating for, creating, realizing, and sustaining an ethical and inclusive Cashless Society.

</div></div>","Centuries after the Titan War, the galaxy enjoys relative peace under the rule of the Astral Union. Its citizens want for nothing and the defense force, led by the famed Astral Templars, is more than a match for the few rogue elements that trouble them.
The Disciples of Uul, a pacifistic sect of crystal-wielding mystics- having vowed to never again use their uncanny abilities for bloodshed- keep watch from afar and record galactic happenings. Working in conjunction with the Union and its Templars, the Uul’thar play an integral part in maintaining the order.
Harmony never lasts, though. Peace is an illusion. Something stirs from beyond the border… and within.
SUNSWORN: EDGE OF ANNIHILATION is the ULTIMATE space fantasy adventure! This FULL-LENGTH NOVEL will rekindle your love of the genre and introduce you to a universe full of compelling characters, rich settings, thrilling situations and genuine ESCAPIST ENTERTAINMENT! 
PREVIEW THE FIRST THREE CHAPTERS (as of 3rd draft) HERE: 
https://drive.google.com/open?id=17GRG1ttXVk4syC72uwv2ReUuYGlI4JKt
The Visual Companion is a compilation of concept art by ComicsGate's finest, and will include commentary to explain each piece! Characters, creatures, settings, starships- there will be plenty of images to introduce you to the SUNSWORN universe! This book will come in comic format and contain 32 pages.
Cover art by VINNIE TARTAMELLA:

SUNSWORN began as a home-brew RPG adventure developed more than 15 years ago. When I witnessed the death throes of my favorite franchises I decided that we deserve better. We can DO better! We must create for the future, establish our own IP's and spawn new legends for coming generations to enjoy!
SUNSWORN: EDGE OF ANNIHILATION is the first installment in this epic science fantasy story, packed with wondrous settings and characters you'll love (or love to hate)! You'll experience the journey alongside them and share in their successes and failures, loss and gain. 
Be a part of this!

<p>There is no shortage of loaded - and often gendered - symbolism in the sport of cockfighting. And this becomes a starting point for author Kier-La Janisse (HOUSE OF PSYCHOTIC WOMEN) to investigate the themes of obsession, competition, divination and self-ascribed nobility that dominate the hyper-masculine world of Monte Hellman's existential and controversial film, COCKFIGHTER (1974).</p>
<p>In this, its fifth book, Canadian micro-publisher Spectacular Optical explores the intersection of Southern Gothic, ritual masculinity and second wave feminism in COCKFIGHTER with a combination of cultural criticism and production history. The book will also examine in detail the Charles Willeford pulp novel and the bloodsport that inspired it. While Willeford always maintained that it was a tale of obsession and not 'about' cockfighting, this unique sport nonetheless provides all the contradictions necessary for a great lone wolf story. And here, author Kier-La Janisse faces up against her own contradictions as she personally delves into the strange world of cockfighting in the American south.</p>

<p>COCKFIGHTER stars character actor Warren Oates as Frank Mansfield, a career cocker who has taken a vow of silence until he can win the Cockfighter of the Year Award. Surrounded by fellow cockfighters played by Harry Dean Stanton, Ed Begley, Jr, Steve Railsback, Richard B. Shull and even author/screenwriter Charles Willeford himself, the film traverses the underground cockfighting world of the Deep South, with a highly detailed documentation of this unique subculture brought vividly to life by esteemed cinematographer Nestor Almendros.</p>
<p>The book features interviews with director Monte Hellman and producer Roger Corman – who will sign special edition copies of the book available only through the IndieGogo campaign - as well as several other surviving cast and crew.</p>

<p><strong>The Art of Divination is a process of finding meaning in symbols or patterns, especially in times of great uncertainty. </strong>It is a communication with higher consciousness &amp; guidance. The he(art) work on each card is a prayer, deep healing, &amp; communion with the Divine. It’s accessing an endless well of colorful textured language from the mysterious realm of the soul. Each sacred offering is a clue to the truth of who we are, leading us closer to ourselves and why we’re here at this time. It’s an opportunity for us to take an individual journey into our inner landscapes, bringing forth our deepest expressions of wholeness and the embodied truth felt deep in our bones. It’s welcoming all parts of ourselves home, surrendering to the mystery, and safely entering into the darkness and the shadow.</p>
<p><strong>It’s merging spirit and earth through cosmic creation. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The archetypal transmissions in the Sacred (R)evolution oracle can be read in many ways, depending on what you’d like to receive from it. </strong>Though there will be several guided card layout spreads suggested in the guidebook. Each will have its own unique sacred geometry and symbology to support you in deepening into YOU! </p>
<p>To begin, we invite you to familiarize yourself with the deck by setting sacred space and breathing your own life and energy into it. Set an intention of how you'd like to journey with the deck and what you'd like to receive from it. You can add it to your altar, smudge it to clear the energy or anoint it with holy oil if you feel called to any of those sacred practices. Use your intuition and instincts to do what feels best in your body. Know that it's all an invitation, and if you're not sure what to do, there will be guided videos and suggestions for you in the Interactive Portal if you choose that perk! </p>
<p>Notice which cards or channeled messages resonate with you most? Be in communion with the deck as a living sacred talisman and it will serve as a deep companion for the journey ahead into 2021 and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>It's time to become intimate with yourself, each other and all of life. We invite you to step into the vibrational pulsing light web of the Universe and our deep interconnection and interBeing. </strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605401445/yagfogzvglw5hcnfrki5.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p><strong>Hello Beloved!</strong> <strong>I’m <a href=""https://www.lainielovedalby.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Lainie Love Dalby</a> </strong>and I'm on a passionate mission to free Human Spirits that have been told they’re either “too much” or “not enough” to Sparkle SHAMELESSLY® and step into their authentic power &amp; sovereignty. </p>
<p>I'm a big-hearted Ecstatic Embodied Leadership™ mentor, bestselling author, ceremonialist, holy healer, visionary shamanic healing artist, fierce trailblazer in womxn’s spirituality and leadership, and an overall catalyst of personal and planetary transformation.</p>
<p>With my own flavor of multimedia ministry, I'm dismantling old systems, ideas and ways of being that promote separateness, dim our unique #SOULSPARKLE and limit our full (r)evolutionary potential. I'm also deeply passionate about ending our culture’s rampant disregard for LIFE, especially the overt &amp; covert violence that’s perpetrated against the Sacred Feminine and our own bodies, by restoring sacred reconnection around the globe.</p>
<p><strong>I am deeply devoted to creating containers of deep healing, soul growth, sacred play &amp; alchemical transformation.  This multi-media and multi dimensional Sacred (R)evolution® Oracle Deck is one of these potent containers!</strong></p>
<p>For the last 5 years in my shamanic healing art practice I’ve been creating a series of (R)evolutionary He(art) works that are deeply layered and textured universes filled with deep meaning, intentions and deep healing power. Each is its own portal to transformation and empowerment imbued with fierce prayers, crystal medicine, animal medicine, plant allies, sacred geometry, alchemical symbology and more. </p>
<p>Up until now, these he(art) works have all been used for personal healing journeys, wether my own or for a commission for another person or a couple. </p>
<p>I'm now being called to use this potent shamanic healing art process to create the <strong>Sacred (R)evolution® Oracle Deck</strong> focused on global healing and transformation filled with codes for the birth of the New Earth. This is a deep act of sacred service and it's adding my unique stroke to the cosmic masterpiece of which we're all a part!</p>
<p><strong>And I'm so thrilled to invite you to partner with me for the journey!! Just choose a perk to the right!</strong></p>

We are in such a collective cauldron of uncertainty at this time and needing to tune into our sacred center and still point within. During such deep pockets of uncertainty, oracle decks, tarot and divination are some of the most powerful sacred tools we have to THRIVE and to tap into Divine guidance. 
That's why Transformational Catalyst, Shamanic Healing Artist and Bestselling Author, Lainie Love Dalby has teamed up with the Ecstatic Embodied Leadership Academy to create the multi-media and multidimensional Sacred (R)evolution® Oracle Deck at this most crucial time in human history!
This is the first oracle deck of its kind since it comes with an interactive portal to accompany the deck & guidebook. It’s a choose your own adventure journey where each of the 44 cards comes with a guided sacred practice that ranges from ritual & ceremony, to ecstatic embodied movement, to shamanic journeys, to potent visualizations and more that you’ll be personally guided through in videos, Mp3s and live transmissions! 

This oracle deck is a multidimensional portal of healing, re-membrance, and transformation filled with sacred and holy transmissions embedded with deep magic, mythic mystery, ancient wisdom, light codes and oracular wisdom for the ancient future.
Within it, we are holding space for you to come home to yourself, your soul essence, your wholeness, and remember who you truly are and why you're here. 
Overall, this oracle deck is a deep & holy RE-wilding root healing journey. It is an individual and collective soul retrieval, calling all parts of ourselves back home now. 
Like the Buddhist Tonglen Meditation, it is transmuting the poisons and darkness in our world into medicine.  And it is a reminder on how to reclaim our original power and inherent divinity as well as reawaken the body as a portal to our power.
Plus, each he(art) work is encoded with wisdom that is unlocked through oracular practice where Lainie Love will be channeling messages from each of the images that comes through. You’ll be receiving direct divine transmissions of the evolutionary mutation we’re undergoing and opening to be transfigured by potent light codes, holy vibrational patterns and cosmic resonant frequencies. With your support, Lainie Love will dedicate and expand this offering so that each of the 44 cards will offer cosmic shamanic archetypal transmissions to support your personal awakening as well as ignite Galactic Gaia Unity consciousness in our world for the ascension of humanity. 
Each of the shamanic healing art pieces will be birthed with light language transmissions, crystal medicine, codes for the New Earth, and prayers and intentions as they are created for deep personal and planetary transmutation.  
Your contribution will help Lainie Love dedicate her time and energy exclusively to this potent initiatory journey. 

This is the time of the great alchemical transmutation of humanity and we're your magical allies on this choose your own adventure immersion.
The deck is laid out into 4 different sections to help you spiral into your center and deepest truths...to support you in coming home to essence.


Re-member: Coming Home to the Body.

Re-wild: Coming Home to the Body of Mother Earth.

Re-weave: Coming Home to the Body of Humanity

Re-birth: Coming Home to the Body of All That Is

The cards will be approx. 4.5"" in Diameter, printed on premium heavyweight card stock and emblazoned on the back with rose gold foil. Each deck will come with a booklet naming each of the he(art) works, sharing a channeled message directly from the art and explaining the symbolic meanings of each card. Additionally, there is a multi-media interactive portal in the Ecstatic Embodied Leadership Academy where each card comes with a guided sacred practice that ranges from ritual & ceremony, to ecstatic embodied movement, to shamanic journeys, to expressive arts, to potent visualizations and more!
Some of the themes that will be explored in the oracle cards are: 

the great homecoming
liberation for ALL
sacredness and reverence
coming into right relationship
following divine guidance
the decolonizing journey
tapping into our intuition
exquisite lovemaking to life itself
blissful ecstatic existence
healing the shadow as well as karmic wounds & ancestral baggage
slowing down to feel more
reclaiming our sovereign seat of power
alchemical healing
self love and soul care
honoring our sacred body temple
unleashing our full creative capacities
tapping into our sexual power & Shakti life force
awakening the inner heart fire
the medicine of elementals & crystals as well as plant cosmic energies
sacred reconnection & the art of belonging
bringing our deepest gifts in service to the world and unleashing our SHAMELESS Sparkle!

Some names of cards that have channeled through so far: Keeper of Death & Rebirth Mysteries, Re-wilding Your Primal Nature, Mycelial Web Walker, Rhythmic Alignment with the One, Visionary Eye Awakening, and The Sacred Union of our Humanity & Divinity
The Art of Divination is a process of finding meaning in symbols or patterns, especially in times of great uncertainty. It is a communication with higher consciousness & guidance. The he(art) work on each card is a prayer, deep healing, & communion with the Divine. It’s accessing an endless well of colorful textured language from the mysterious realm of the soul. Each sacred offering is a clue to the truth of who we are, leading us closer to ourselves and why we’re here at this time. It’s an opportunity for us to take an individual journey into our inner landscapes, bringing forth our deepest expressions of wholeness and the embodied truth felt deep in our bones. It’s welcoming all parts of ourselves home, surrendering to the mystery, and safely entering into the darkness and the shadow.
It’s merging spirit and earth through cosmic creation. 
The archetypal transmissions in the Sacred (R)evolution oracle can be read in many ways, depending on what you’d like to receive from it. Though there will be several guided card layout spreads suggested in the guidebook. Each will have its own unique sacred geometry and symbology to support you in deepening into YOU! 
To begin, we invite you to familiarize yourself with the deck by setting sacred space and breathing your own life and energy into it. Set an intention of how you'd like to journey with the deck and what you'd like to receive from it. You can add it to your altar, smudge it to clear the energy or anoint it with holy oil if you feel called to any of those sacred practices. Use your intuition and instincts to do what feels best in your body. Know that it's all an invitation, and if you're not sure what to do, there will be guided videos and suggestions for you in the Interactive Portal if you choose that perk! 
Notice which cards or channeled messages resonate with you most? Be in communion with the deck as a living sacred talisman and it will serve as a deep companion for the journey ahead into 2021 and beyond.
It's time to become intimate with yourself, each other and all of life. We invite you to step into the vibrational pulsing light web of the Universe and our deep interconnection and interBeing. 
If you’re ready to break the chains of patriarchy, to come home to your body and our Great Mother and to remember who you truly are, then this oracle deck adventure is for you!!

Hello Beloved! I’m Lainie Love Dalby and I'm on a passionate mission to free Human Spirits that have been told they’re either “too much” or “not enough” to Sparkle SHAMELESSLY® and step into their authentic power & sovereignty. 
I'm a big-hearted Ecstatic Embodied Leadership™ mentor, bestselling author, ceremonialist, holy healer, visionary shamanic healing artist, fierce trailblazer in womxn’s spirituality and leadership, and an overall catalyst of personal and planetary transformation.
With my own flavor of multimedia ministry, I'm dismantling old systems, ideas and ways of being that promote separateness, dim our unique #SOULSPARKLE and limit our full (r)evolutionary potential. I'm also deeply passionate about ending our culture’s rampant disregard for LIFE, especially the overt & covert violence that’s perpetrated against the Sacred Feminine and our own bodies, by restoring sacred reconnection around the globe.
I am deeply devoted to creating containers of deep healing, soul growth, sacred play & alchemical transformation.  This multi-media and multi dimensional Sacred (R)evolution® Oracle Deck is one of these potent containers!
For the last 5 years in my shamanic healing art practice I’ve been creating a series of (R)evolutionary He(art) works that are deeply layered and textured universes filled with deep meaning, intentions and deep healing power. Each is its own portal to transformation and empowerment imbued with fierce prayers, crystal medicine, animal medicine, plant allies, sacred geometry, alchemical symbology and more. 
Up until now, these he(art) works have all been used for personal healing journeys, wether my own or for a commission for another person or a couple. 
I'm now being called to use this potent shamanic healing art process to create the Sacred (R)evolution® Oracle Deck focused on global healing and transformation filled with codes for the birth of the New Earth. This is a deep act of sacred service and it's adding my unique stroke to the cosmic masterpiece of which we're all a part!
And I'm so thrilled to invite you to partner with me for the journey!! Just choose a perk to the right!

<br/>My name is Jennifer Rose Asher and I am the author of <i>Journey To My Daughter.</i> I wrote this book initially for my daughter because I wanted her to know everything I went through to find her. Around that time, I worked as an adoption consultant and would often verbally tell an abridged version of this story to my families when they were frustrated and sad through the adoption process, to give them hope that all was happening as it was supposed to for them to find their child. Those families found my journey very inspiring and encouraged me to share the story with the world.<br/><br/>On the surface, this is a memoir of how I became a mother. It details everything from my decision to have a child (a story unto itself), through 2 miscarriages and a whirlwind trip to Vietnam, and finishes with bringing my daughter home. Along the way my husband and I tried multiple approaches to looking for our child and in the end would never had predicted where we would find her.<br/><br/>The story reads like a novel. It is scary at times (at least it was scary when I was living through it), and at times is way stranger than any fiction I could create. I try to keep my sense of humor throughout the book and I believe it will make you laugh more than you will cry.<br/><br/>For families or people who are considering adoption, I have re-written this book for you (the original scribbles for my daughter were a mess!) and I pray it gives you confidence that your child is out there regardless of any difficulties you may be experiencing today. I hope it can help you determine for yourself what things are important to you and your family for your adoption, and that reading my story may help you avoid some of the mistakes I made.<br/><br/>Through re-writing this book, however, I learned that the story is just as much an internal struggle to find myself as it is an external journey to actually being united with my daughter. I tried so hard at the beginning (and through much of the book) to force things to go my way. I eventually recognized that I needed to follow the signs when I was headed down the wrong path. When I let go of control a bit, and allowed the tide to direct me, everything worked out as it should.<br/><br/>I hope my story can guide every reader to be more aware of the signs around them and teach them to be flexible in their thinking so they may adjust their plans accordingly. For me, this has made life so much more fulfilling and avoided many headaches. I am still working on it, but the awareness for me has been life-changing.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope <i>Journey To My Daughter</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:<ul>
<li>Have I ignored or not noticed signs from the universe in my own life?</li>
<li>Would recognizing these signs and allowing them to guide me have made a journey or decision easier for me?</li>
<li>How can I approach situations in the future to take these signs into account and help me make wiser choices?</li>
</ul>
<p>I am still working on this myself and I really look forward to exploring these questions, and beyond, with my readers!</p>

<h3>Special Perk - Pendant</h3>
<p>As an adoptive mom, the adoption triad is so special to me. All three members of the triad are equally important and work together to form a triangle of support. I discovered a pendant with the adoption symbol--a triangle with a heart through it during my adoption process and I wore it constantly to reinforce my identity as an adoptive mom even before I found my daughter.</p>
<p>If you are an adoptee, adoptive parent, have placed a child for adoption, or even if adoption has touched you through a friend or family member, this special perk is for you. During the time of the story I tell in this book, I often had friends and even strangers recognize the charm and tell me how their life had been touched by adoption. It made me feel special and a part of the adoption community. That is why I have chosen it as the perfect companion gift with the book.</p>
<h3>Personal Baby Book</h3>
<p>I am now offering an additional perk option specially compiled for Adoption Choices families.  This is a unique opportunity to work directly with Jennifer, the author, on developing your own personal story for your family/child.  Jennifer will help you to craft language appropriate for a young child to accurately describe your family's personal story in a healthy and age appropriate way.  This will give your family a concrete book they can turn to time and again.  Your child can have this book to refer to throughout life and have their story presented consistently, in the way you want he or she to understand it.  This consistent positive message and ""love letter"" from your family will likely become a most treasured heirloom for your child.  Here is a video of the baby book Jennifer wrote for her daughter, Hilary, when she was only an infant.  Hilary still treasures this story at age 20.  <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iD2-aIGCug&amp;t=28s"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1iD2-aIGCug&amp;amp...</a></p>
<h3>International supporters </h3>
<p>I do not recommend international shipping and it is not offered directly on this page. However, I very much appreciate your support! I have created a special perk for you called the International Book Club. You will receive 10 copies of the ebook to distribute to your friends and family. Then I will set up a time for you that will be convenient in your time zone when I can join your club to discuss the book and answer questions.</p>
<p>If you very much want to have a signed physical copy of the book, please email me at jenniferroseasher@gmail.com and I will get the information to send you an invoice to cover shipping in addition to the cost of your selected perk.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Campaign Goals</h3>
<p>Tier 1: Hit $5,000 and the ebook/softcover editions get published (this is the minimum needed) GOAL MET August 15!!<br/>Tier 2: Hit $7,000 and we'll get an audiobook edition-I REALLY want to make an audiobook!!<br/>Tier 3: Hit $8,000 and the book will get a hardback edition.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies are expected to ship.</p>

<p>Not everyone can support, but that doesn't mean you can't get something out of it!<br/>I will reward the top 3 people who refer the most backers at the end of the campaign (30 days). Here's how:</p>
<p>At the top of the campaign page, you will see the ""share"" buttons. Click on the ""chain"" icon to get a custom link just for you. (Note: don't use the URL in the browser window as it won't work to track referrals and you won't get credit ?)</p>

I have created a special perk for you called the International Book Club. You will receive 10 copies of the ebook to distribute to your friends and family. Then I will set up a time for you that will be convenient in your time zone when I can join your club to discuss the book and answer questions.
If you very much want to have a signed physical copy of the book, please email me at jenniferroseasher@gmail.com and I will get the information to send you an invoice to cover shipping in addition to the cost of your selected perk.

Campaign Goals
Tier 1: Hit $5,000 and the ebook/softcover editions get published (this is the minimum needed) GOAL MET August 15!!Tier 2: Hit $7,000 and we'll get an audiobook edition-I REALLY want to make an audiobook!!Tier 3: Hit $8,000 and the book will get a hardback edition.

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies are expected to ship.


Not everyone can support, but that doesn't mean you can't get something out of it!I will reward the top 3 people who refer the most backers at the end of the campaign (30 days). Here's how:
At the top of the campaign page, you will see the ""share"" buttons. Click on the ""chain"" icon to get a custom link just for you. (Note: don't use the URL in the browser window as it won't work to track referrals and you won't get credit ?)
Copy that link and paste it on your social media, email it to a friend, or text a fellow book lover.
When someone clicks on that link and backs the book, you get 1 entry!

This campaign will remain active through InDemand until I have sold out of planners, at which point I'll pull it. Thank you so much for your support!<br/> </p><h3>**update April 28: This project was fully funded on the first day! Thank you so much for your support!!</h3><p>--&gt;In order to keep the momentum going for the rest of the campaign, I'm going to come up with some stretch goals.   **<strong>First one: if/when we hit $15,000 everyone will receive 10 Tudor coloring page printouts included in the package with their planner this year.  **Second Stretch Goal: when we hit $20,000 all backers will receive an electronic copy of <i>Owen </i>by Tony Riches, the start to his historical fiction saga tracing the Tudor story from a Welsh squire to Gloriana (thank you, Tony, for your amazing support). **I'll think of more rewards further on as we get close to these first stretch goals!</strong><br/>Here's to a highly organized and Tudorfied 2022 for all of us!**</p><h2><strong>Overview:</strong></h2><p><br/>Hi! I'm Heather and I'm passionate about building peace and empathy through learning history. To that end, I've been podcasting on Tudor history since 2009 when I launched the Renaissance English History Podcast. Even before then, I built my first history website in 1998! In 2016 I created the Tudor Planner, which brings together all the awesome of a weekly/monthly diary with Tudor history. There's This Week in History, musical listening lists, quotes, all wrapped up in a gorgeous cover that looks like a manuscript.</p><h3><strong>The Basics About the Tudor Planner:</strong></h3><p>I'm passionate about planners myself, and am always checking out new ones. This planner incorporates planning elements that I love, in a layout that will be familiar, while also mixing in tons of Tudor history, in a style that resembles an old illuminated manuscript.</p><ul>
<li>The pages are 6x9 inches (close to an A5 size). The cover adds a bit of extra space, but doesn't hang out very much further (see photos for more detail).</li>
<li>It's about 1 inch thick.</li>
<li>The cover changes each year, but is always a medieval or Tudor period work, <strong>evoking the feel of being in a 16th century library.</strong>
</li>
<li>Dated <strong>Weekly and monthly layouts</strong>, the Tudor Planner runs from December 2021 to the end of January 2023 so you can start to use it straight away, and it will carry you through planning early in the following year. </li>
<li>End-of-month <strong>check in pages</strong> to keep you on track with your goals, and set the stage for a productive new month.</li>
<li>Plenty of <strong>notes pages</strong>, including dotted, lined, and plain.</li>
<li>Three pages of <strong>stickers</strong>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Two sided pocket</strong> in the back to hold papers and notes.</li>
<li>
<strong>All major holidays noted (US &amp; UK), as well as many Tudor feast days.</strong> Of course the Tudors lived through the Reformation (which manifested itself a little differently in England than in the rest of Europe) so the holidays our Tudor friends would have had in 1590 were different than in 1510. Still, the major and most popular ones are included so you can celebrate like a Tudor.</li>
<li>Each week has an interesting <strong>Tudor fact that happened that week</strong>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Music suggestions each month</strong>, and a link to a Spotify playlist so you can listen to Tallis while planning.</li>
<li>All planners shipped through this IndieGoGo fundraiser will include a <strong>signed thank you postcard</strong>.</li>
<li>Spiral binding allows the planner to lie flat.</li>
<li>High quality 120gsm Golden Sun Uncoated Woodfree paper.</li>
<li>Shipped from Maryland, USA.</li>
<li><i>Created with love by a writer who has been sharing stories about history online for over 23 years.</i></li>
<li>The Tudor Planner layouts run Monday to Sunday.<br/> </li>
</ul><h3>Benefits of being an early backer:</h3><p><br/>Of course there are intangibles - you'll have my deepest appreciation, and the good feeling that comes from supporting creative projects. But you'll also be among the first to receive the Tudor Planner when it arrives and ships. </p><p>Plus, the cost of the Tudor Planner will go up considerably after this funding period is over. The retail price is $39.95, and it will stay there until I discount any that are left in March, 2022. Of course, this past year we sold out, so there weren't any to discount. Which brings me nicely to point three: </p><p><strong>You'll guarantee that you get one. I print a limited amount, and last year we sold out in November!</strong></p><p><i>One quick note: when you check out, you'll see some text from IndieGoGo saying that they can't guarantee that you will receive your item. This is because they are not responsible for getting the planners to you - I am - so they can't be held responsible if I don't deliver :)  <strong>By supporting this IndieGoGo project, you guarantee that you'll get a planner when they ship before Thanksgiving (hopefully earlier!). </strong></i></p><p> </p><p><i><strong>People Love the Tudor Planner!</strong></i></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618919836/sysj09umukahpyapteyk.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>Amazon reviews from previous years:</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618919864/wldngshlkeirtgkx0qks.png"" src=""""/></p><h3>
<br/><br/><strong>Meet Heather (aka the Backstory)</strong>
</h3><p>I've been writing and talking about history since 1991 when I started a summer job at a Revolutionary War museum when I was in high school. In 1998 I built my first history website, on Colonial America. And in 2009 I started the Renaissance English History Podcast, which makes it one of the longest continuously running indie history podcasts. Since then I've spoken about podcast community building at writers conferences, and at other podcasting conferences including Sound Education, which was held at Harvard.</p><p>In late 2016 I created the 2017 Tudor Planner,  which was a mix of two of my favorite things - Tudors and planning! It was a weekly/monthly planner that brought together history with planning - something that I definitely needed as a busy mom with a young kiddo. I've always loved planners, since I bought my first Ziggy assignment book in 1989 - I color coded my assignments with Crayola skinny markers in Bold colors.</p><p><strong>Here's the cover from the 2017 Tudor Planner - the very first one:</strong></p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618919955/m5twelscydvvjmk1ta4w.png"" src=""""/></strong></p><p><strong>It was one of those things that I wanted to create basically so that I could buy it.</strong> I thought it would be fun, and I might sell a few dozen. But that first one was way more successful than I ever imagined, and for the 2018 one, I worked with a custom printer. I've been working with the same printer since then, and each year I keep incorporating your feedback, and it gets better and better.</p><p><strong>The Tudor Planner is a gorgeous book that will lead to people wandering by your desk just to check it out, and will cause spontaneous conversations whenever you take it out :) </strong> Because each planner is a unique work of art. It's like having art, history, and planning all wrapped up in one. I mean, what else is there!?</p><p><i>This will be the 6th year that I've created the Tudor Planner, and I rely on these IndieGoGo fundraisers to pay for the printing and distribution - this is all an independent project that I do on my own - there is no publisher involved other than me. So I rely on your support to bring this planner to life each year. </i></p><p><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618920038/hhvmq2pzlbhoysd1gacl.jpg"" src=""""/></i></p><p> </p><h3>Why I'm Running this IndieGoGo (aka, the expenses)</h3><p>The main expense for the Planner is printing.  But there are some other costs I incur including the cover image, which requires the purchase of a high res photo that can run into several hundred dollars to purchase the rights to, and a designer to make it all look great! Then there is warehousing the books at a location in Maryland, and that's where they are packaged and shipped from (which also means additional packing fees).</p><p><strong>Every bit raised will be put towards my work, and the project will happen whether the goal is reached or not. </strong></p><p>The perks I'm offering include all kinds of great stuff, including a digital-only copy of the planner, a brand new Choose Your Own Tudor Adventure game book, various activity books including the one on the Six Wives, the Field of Cloth of Gold, and the original Tudor Activity Book, gift cards from my Tudor Swag shop (TudorFair.com), a podcast episode on a topic of your choice, and tickets to the 2021 Tudorcon. The planners themselves will be shipped around the end of October, in time for the holidays. This is also the lowest price that the planner will be until I discount whatever is left in March of 2022 (if I even have any left then). <strong>So hop on now to get the best deal, AND Tudorific perks!</strong></p><h3>The Impact (I mean, WHY does anyone want a Tudor Planner?):</h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1619000767/q62ulvuyotkeocdhidl3.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">I think of history as a way to connect us to our humanity, to see the humanity in others, and to understand people who are very different than we are. And given what the world has been going through the past year,</span><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;""> maybe now it's more important than ever to connect with the people of the past - especially the Tudors who endured summer after summer of plague and sweating sickness and economic uncertainty - and find within that our common humanity. Maybe now, in the midst of a pandemic and political arguments, this is the time to find ourselves in the people who came before, in their stories, and sew a connection that spans centuries. And by doing that, we might be able to sew deeper connections within our own communities. </span></p><p>Also, when we manage our lives with a planner that helps keep everything organized, the chaos seems a little less scary. </p><p>So yes, it's a crazy time, and because of that I'm also adding in a special perk I introduced last year; the Digital perk for those who want to support the project and get a Tudor Planner of their own, but just don't have the budget for the full physical copy right now. That perk will receive a digital copy of the planner that can be printed out at home, or imported into a note taking app like GoodNotes. </p><p>I always say that I'm a storyteller who makes history accessible because I believe it's a pathway to understanding who we are, our place in the universe, and being more deeply connected to our own humanity. And I try to do that in a physical way with the Tudor Planner each year. </p><p>That sounds pretty heavy for a planner, right? Who knew that a planner could have such a deep meaning?  You just want to track your habits and remember your appointments. But for me, writing out our lives like that is actually kind of sacred, because who knows who will find it in several hundred years, and piece together stories of our own lives from the record we leave in our journals and calendars? </p><p><strong>A couple of bonuses:</strong></p><p><strong>Every backer will receive access to two short courses I've done this past year including an overview of the Elizabethan Explorers, and the Catholic Priest who escaped from the Tower of London.</strong></p><p>I'll also send you the list to all the videos of previous Tudor Summits that I did, starting back in 2017. These were online events that happened every six months for two years featuring leading Tudor authors and historians. I don't do them anymore because of my focus on Tudorcon planning, but there are over 35 talks filled with everything from visiting Tudor London to digging deeper into Mary Tudor. <br/><br/><strong>I'll also send every backer a brand new digital Tudor-themed To Do page which you can either print out, or use on your device. </strong></p><p>At the end of the campaign, I'll send these to each backer. Please make sure to check your email - so often these can go through to spam or junk folders.

Here's how that will work with perks:-->On the last day of each month I will print out the contributions that came in that month, and email everyone their digital perks in the following days. This campaign will remain active through InDemand until I have sold out of planners, at which point I'll pull it. Thank you so much for your support! **update April 28: This project was fully funded on the first day! Thank you so much for your support!!-->In order to keep the momentum going for the rest of the campaign, I'm going to come up with some stretch goals.   **First one: if/when we hit $15,000 everyone will receive 10 Tudor coloring page printouts included in the package with their planner this year.  **Second Stretch Goal: when we hit $20,000 all backers will receive an electronic copy of Owen by Tony Riches, the start to his historical fiction saga tracing the Tudor story from a Welsh squire to Gloriana (thank you, Tony, for your amazing support). **I'll think of more rewards further on as we get close to these first stretch goals!Here's to a highly organized and Tudorfied 2022 for all of us!**Overview:Hi! I'm Heather and I'm passionate about building peace and empathy through learning history. To that end, I've been podcasting on Tudor history since 2009 when I launched the Renaissance English History Podcast. Even before then, I built my first history website in 1998! In 2016 I created the Tudor Planner, which brings together all the awesome of a weekly/monthly diary with Tudor history. There's This Week in History, musical listening lists, quotes, all wrapped up in a gorgeous cover that looks like a manuscript.The Basics About the Tudor Planner:I'm passionate about planners myself, and am always checking out new ones. This planner incorporates planning elements that I love, in a layout that will be familiar, while also mixing in tons of Tudor history, in a style that resembles an old illuminated manuscript.
The pages are 6x9 inches (close to an A5 size). The cover adds a bit of extra space, but doesn't hang out very much further (see photos for more detail).
It's about 1 inch thick.
The cover changes each year, but is always a medieval or Tudor period work, evoking the feel of being in a 16th century library.

Dated Weekly and monthly layouts, the Tudor Planner runs from December 2021 to the end of January 2023 so you can start to use it straight away, and it will carry you through planning early in the following year. 
End-of-month check in pages to keep you on track with your goals, and set the stage for a productive new month.
Plenty of notes pages, including dotted, lined, and plain.
Three pages of stickers.

Two sided pocket in the back to hold papers and notes.

All major holidays noted (US & UK), as well as many Tudor feast days. Of course the Tudors lived through the Reformation (which manifested itself a little differently in England than in the rest of Europe) so the holidays our Tudor friends would have had in 1590 were different than in 1510. Still, the major and most popular ones are included so you can celebrate like a Tudor.
Each week has an interesting Tudor fact that happened that week.

Music suggestions each month, and a link to a Spotify playlist so you can listen to Tallis while planning.
All planners shipped through this IndieGoGo fundraiser will include a signed thank you postcard.
Spiral binding allows the planner to lie flat.
High quality 120gsm Golden Sun Uncoated Woodfree paper.
Shipped from Maryland, USA.
Created with love by a writer who has been sharing stories about history online for over 23 years.
The Tudor Planner layouts run Monday to Sunday. 
Benefits of being an early backer:Of course there are intangibles - you'll have my deepest appreciation, and the good feeling that comes from supporting creative projects. But you'll also be among the first to receive the Tudor Planner when it arrives and ships. Plus, the cost of the Tudor Planner will go up considerably after this funding period is over. The retail price is $39.95, and it will stay there until I discount any that are left in March, 2022. Of course, this past year we sold out, so there weren't any to discount. Which brings me nicely to point three: You'll guarantee that you get one. I print a limited amount, and last year we sold out in November!One quick note: when you check out, you'll see some text from IndieGoGo saying that they can't guarantee that you will receive your item. This is because they are not responsible for getting the planners to you - I am - so they can't be held responsible if I don't deliver :)  By supporting this IndieGoGo project, you guarantee that you'll get a planner when they ship before Thanksgiving (hopefully earlier!).  People Love the Tudor Planner!Amazon reviews from previous years:
Meet Heather (aka the Backstory)
I've been writing and talking about history since 1991 when I started a summer job at a Revolutionary War museum when I was in high school. In 1998 I built my first history website, on Colonial America. And in 2009 I started the Renaissance English History Podcast, which makes it one of the longest continuously running indie history podcasts. Since then I've spoken about podcast community building at writers conferences, and at other podcasting conferences including Sound Education, which was held at Harvard.In late 2016 I created the 2017 Tudor Planner,  which was a mix of two of my favorite things - Tudors and planning! It was a weekly/monthly planner that brought together history with planning - something that I definitely needed as a busy mom with a young kiddo. I've always loved planners, since I bought my first Ziggy assignment book in 1989 - I color coded my assignments with Crayola skinny markers in Bold colors.Here's the cover from the 2017 Tudor Planner - the very first one:It was one of those things that I wanted to create basically so that I could buy it. I thought it would be fun, and I might sell a few dozen. But that first one was way more successful than I ever imagined, and for the 2018 one, I worked with a custom printer. I've been working with the same printer since then, and each year I keep incorporating your feedback, and it gets better and better.The Tudor Planner is a gorgeous book that will lead to people wandering by your desk just to check it out, and will cause spontaneous conversations whenever you take it out :)  Because each planner is a unique work of art. It's like having art, history, and planning all wrapped up in one. I mean, what else is there!?This will be the 6th year that I've created the Tudor Planner, and I rely on these IndieGoGo fundraisers to pay for the printing and distribution - this is all an independent project that I do on my own - there is no publisher involved other than me. So I rely on your support to bring this planner to life each year.  Why I'm Running this IndieGoGo (aka, the expenses)The main expense for the Planner is printing.  But there are some other costs I incur including the cover image, which requires the purchase of a high res photo that can run into several hundred dollars to purchase the rights to, and a designer to make it all look great! Then there is warehousing the books at a location in Maryland, and that's where they are packaged and shipped from (which also means additional packing fees).Every bit raised will be put towards my work, and the project will happen whether the goal is reached or not. The perks I'm offering include all kinds of great stuff, including a digital-only copy of the planner, a brand new Choose Your Own Tudor Adventure game book, various activity books including the one on the Six Wives, the Field of Cloth of Gold, and the original Tudor Activity Book, gift cards from my Tudor Swag shop (TudorFair.com), a podcast episode on a topic of your choice, and tickets to the 2021 Tudorcon. The planners themselves will be shipped around the end of October, in time for the holidays. This is also the lowest price that the planner will be until I discount whatever is left in March of 2022 (if I even have any left then). So hop on now to get the best deal, AND Tudorific perks!The Impact (I mean, WHY does anyone want a Tudor Planner?):I think of history as a way to connect us to our humanity, to see the humanity in others, and to understand people who are very different than we are. And given what the world has been going through the past year, maybe now it's more important than ever to connect with the people of the past - especially the Tudors who endured summer after summer of plague and sweating sickness and economic uncertainty - and find within that our common humanity. Maybe now, in the midst of a pandemic and political arguments, this is the time to find ourselves in the people who came before, in their stories, and sew a connection that spans centuries. And by doing that, we might be able to sew deeper connections within our own communities. Also, when we manage our lives with a planner that helps keep everything organized, the chaos seems a little less scary. So yes, it's a crazy time, and because of that I'm also adding in a special perk I introduced last year; the Digital perk for those who want to support the project and get a Tudor Planner of their own, but just don't have the budget for the full physical copy right now. That perk will receive a digital copy of the planner that can be printed out at home, or imported into a note taking app like GoodNotes. I always say that I'm a storyteller who makes history accessible because I believe it's a pathway to understanding who we are, our place in the universe, and being more deeply connected to our own humanity. And I try to do that in a physical way with the Tudor Planner each year. That sounds pretty heavy for a planner, right? Who knew that a planner could have such a deep meaning?  You just want to track your habits and remember your appointments. But for me, writing out our lives like that is actually kind of sacred, because who knows who will find it in several hundred years, and piece together stories of our own lives from the record we leave in our journals and calendars? A couple of bonuses:Every backer will receive access to two short courses I've done this past year including an overview of the Elizabethan Explorers, and the Catholic Priest who escaped from the Tower of London.I'll also send you the list to all the videos of previous Tudor Summits that I did, starting back in 2017. These were online events that happened every six months for two years featuring leading Tudor authors and historians. I don't do them anymore because of my focus on Tudorcon planning, but there are over 35 talks filled with everything from visiting Tudor London to digging deeper into Mary Tudor. I'll also send every backer a brand new digital Tudor-themed To Do page which you can either print out, or use on your device. At the end of the campaign, I'll send these to each backer. Please make sure to check your email - so often these can go through to spam or junk folders. I'll do my best to keep things updated here so you know when items have gone out, too.  Risks & ChallengesThis is the 6th time I've published a Tudor Planner, so things are a lot more clear now than they've been in the past, but there are always underlying risks. The printer could drop the ball, or the shipment could get delayed and stuck in customs, or there could be another backup in the Suez Canal. But since I'm using the same printer I've used for the past five years, and I'm starting almost a month earlier than I have in past years, I'm not anticipating any problems with that. Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can't contribute (or you just don't really care about planners, but you want to support the podcast anyway) I would love any and all shares of this campaign!

<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Why We Created Sy the Mighty Minder</strong></h3>
<p>Sy Hubby had chronic asthma at a young age and was forced to stay indoors often. As a result, to stay active he watched a lot of YouTube. We noticed there wasn't any African American kid influencers. So we created a YouTube channel, where Sy played a spy character hero to help fight against bullying; the channel has successfully garnered over 2.1 million viewers. <br/>The spy character served as the inspiration for Sy the Mighty Minder™ (Alien Guardian), as well as Sy's belief that “Just because a kid is bad, doesn’t mean they can’t be good again.""  Eventually we created an entire story and universe built around this character.</p>
<p>It’s like Star Wars meets Black Panther meets Elf on a Shelf!</p>
<p><i>We hope to bring love to the world and remind every child of the powers of doing good deeds, compassion, kindness and friendship.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Being a part of the Women in Toys association, I am uniquely qualified to bring this product from a concept to reality. My attitude on this project has been that if don't know how to do something (like packaging) find someone who can. That attitude has made this whole project come together in a matter of months.</p>
<p><strong>Publishing Partnerships:</strong> Our ultimate goal is to partner with a major book publisher/distributor to guarantee this book and those to come are accessible in locations around the country and world.</p>
<p><strong>Distribution:</strong> Our biggest challenge, as with many direct-to-market books, will be placement in bookstores and libraries. Even with over 50% of book sales taking place via Amazon, we are passionate about having a local presence in small businesses as well as chain bookstores. We have a growing list of target locations and will be updating you here as we add new libraries, bookstores, gift shops and organizational partnerships.</p>
<p><strong>Being Evergreen: </strong>To extend the lifespan of this product beyond it will be important to build a community. Any referrals for virtual (later, in-person) story time readings and book purchases for schools, libraries and organizations will be incredibly helpful. We have a list of those we plan to approach and have begun reaching out.</p>

Why We Created Sy the Mighty Minder
Sy Hubby had chronic asthma at a young age and was forced to stay indoors often. As a result, to stay active he watched a lot of YouTube. We noticed there wasn't any African American kid influencers. So we created a YouTube channel, where Sy played a spy character hero to help fight against bullying; the channel has successfully garnered over 2.1 million viewers. The spy character served as the inspiration for Sy the Mighty Minder™ (Alien Guardian), as well as Sy's belief that “Just because a kid is bad, doesn’t mean they can’t be good again.""  Eventually we created an entire story and universe built around this character.
It’s like Star Wars meets Black Panther meets Elf on a Shelf!
We hope to bring love to the world and remind every child of the powers of doing good deeds, compassion, kindness and friendship.
 
Risks & Challenges
 
Being a part of the Women in Toys association, I am uniquely qualified to bring this product from a concept to reality. My attitude on this project has been that if don't know how to do something (like packaging) find someone who can. That attitude has made this whole project come together in a matter of months.
Publishing Partnerships: Our ultimate goal is to partner with a major book publisher/distributor to guarantee this book and those to come are accessible in locations around the country and world.
Distribution: Our biggest challenge, as with many direct-to-market books, will be placement in bookstores and libraries. Even with over 50% of book sales taking place via Amazon, we are passionate about having a local presence in small businesses as well as chain bookstores. We have a growing list of target locations and will be updating you here as we add new libraries, bookstores, gift shops and organizational partnerships.
Being Evergreen: To extend the lifespan of this product beyond it will be important to build a community. Any referrals for virtual (later, in-person) story time readings and book purchases for schools, libraries and organizations will be incredibly helpful. We have a list of those we plan to approach and have begun reaching out.

<h3><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h3>
<p><strong><i>Shell: A Completely Untrue, Totally Made-up Tale from Not Working at a Startup</i></strong> tells the story of the New Hire. After living overseas and working at a high-profile tech firm, our protagonist moves back to the US and takes a job at what seems to be an up-and-coming startup. There, she manages big ideas — and even bigger personalities. At a professional crossroads, the New Hire not only questions her decision to join the startup, but also whether or not the people she works with are simply incompetent or actually committing fraud.<br/><br/>Having worked for big companies in corporate America for many years, I always thought it would be interesting to reveal a little bit of what really goes on behind-the-scenes. A pay-no-attention-to-the-man-behind-the-curtain story, if you will. Now, more than ever, we live in an age of misinformation. Understanding facts and what is true is getting increasingly more difficult, even though information has never been more easily accessible, especially with our endless scroll culture. Of course, there are two sides to every story. With more availability comes a greater opportunity to craft your own narrative, which may or may not be true. What happens when this type of deceit and dishonesty invades your workplace? What if the person you are working for is charming, successful, and seemingly wealthy, but you suspect might also be a complete and utter fake?<br/><br/><strong><i>Shell </i></strong>is unique because I know, from personal experience, how easy it is to become ingrained within a company’s culture. You want to believe, especially when the leader is magnetic. Self-interest is a much stronger motivator than people think. It is much easier to get yourself stuck in a trap, than it is to get yourself out of one.<br/><br/>This book explores the intersections of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fact and Perception</li>
<li>Believing and Wanting to Believe</li>
<li>Friendship and Betrayal</li>
<li>Too Good and Too Good to Be True</li>
<li>Morality and Self-Preservation</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><p>In this book, you will not only meet the New Hire and her numerous colleagues: the Founder, the CTO, the CMO and the Stepdaughter. You will enter the world of startups. Welcome to the New Frontier. No rules, no roadmap, and no accountability.

I paint a world that’s ambiguous; gray becomes the dominant color. My hope is that readers get some insight into its appeals — and pitfalls. Readers will be able to identify with New Hire and the impasse in which she has found herself.<br/><br/>If you are a working professional, who has either held a job in tech or has an interest in startups, you will enjoy this book. If you like workplace comedies, the absurdity and quirkiness of coworkers who you spend up to eight hours a day with, you will enjoy this book. Or, if you’re simply interested in how white-collar crime has become a $400B industry in the United States alone, you will enjoy this book.<br/><br/>As with any good story, the evidence is all there, perhaps right under your nose, but the trick, of course, is knowing where to look. That is never obvious.</p><p> </p><h3><strong>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></h3><p>This book will be published with New Degree Press.

</h3><p><i><strong>The Data Storm</strong> <strong>will look at the transformation</strong> of the illegal scene in the 90s. Between the U.S., Europe and Hong Kong, crackers strove for global deals through huge data lines. Bigger and better umbrella organizations emerged. From then on, cracking and hacking games developed into an international business – even with sophisticated hardware copying tools at hand. The narrative of CRACKERS II reveals the story of some outstanding crackers and hackers on C64, SNES, Megadrive (Genesis), Amiga and especially on the Atari ST. </i></p><p><i>Relive the best computer times and experience the exceptional methods of famous code breakers, disk dealers, software pirates and law makers in the 1990s.</i><br/><br/> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622831094/uhsnpvw6h7ovlcgx9qtt.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><br/><i><strong>All book shots taken from “The Gold Rush” (see examples under the video).</strong></i></p><p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621239351/cits6rfjxmvxaamnioou.png"" src=""""/></p><h2>Book Quality</h2><p> </p><ul>

<br/><i>In the 90s, the data lines ran hot and cracked games became a global business. During this period, European groups began to intensify their relationship with the American boards...</i><br/> </h3><p><i><strong>Alongside Elitendo, the International Cracking Service (ICS)</strong> swings into action with a lucrative Atari ST and SNES offering. </i><i>The BBS board gains astonishing popularity. Especially inside the US-Atari scene, a “modem war” breaks out. To everyone’s surprise, the mastermind is a woman. Dark City of Fear, Maximum Overdrive, Pipeline and Black SnowSTorm – as the boards are called here – try to fight back.</i></p><p><br/><i><strong>Meanwhile in France, in the midst of the French gaming boom</strong>, a group of teenagers find the door to a new world. They meet in the schoolyard to form a computer alliance. The story of Fuzion is the real-life tale of Atari freaks reaching out for “the stars”. Their role models are Replicants and Blade Runners and when they join forces via the French RTEL, the world of Orion, Ellfire and Cameo is turned upside down.... Between the stalls of the Barras, we also meet Zippy again, together with Birdy and the Scottish traders. We track down what would remain untold and continue to hang on to The Medway Boys, Automation, Pompey Pirates and the British way of cracking. We also tell of Italian opulence, of a swapper centre in a villa and of Mafiasoft, of Swiss affairs and fake AT&amp;T calling cards, of the computer paradise Poland with its liberal laws, and of special Amiga copiers on black markets.</i></p><p><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621238834/ojwciroz5wk4316i9nsq.png"" src=""""/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1622822183/fbfzm76xsau2jbarpiac.png"" src=""""/><br/><br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1621238834/ojwciroz5wk4316i9nsq.png"" src=""""/></p><p><br/><i><strong>CRACKERS II makes the 90s computer world</strong> <strong>tangible</strong> and separates the wheat (elite) from the chaff (lamer). American distribution is redefined and cracking is questioned by the crackers themselves. The book wanders across continents and proves the global basis of the illegal umbrella organisations. From the disk market and BBS Boards to console trading, we move through space and time and report on perhaps the biggest piracy coup of all time.

CRACKERS I: The Gold Rush (available)CRACKERS II: The Data Storm (campaign)
The Data Storm will look at the transformation of the illegal scene in the 90s. Between the U.S., Europe and Hong Kong, crackers strove for global deals through huge data lines. Bigger and better umbrella organizations emerged. From then on, cracking and hacking games developed into an international business – even with sophisticated hardware copying tools at hand. The narrative of CRACKERS II reveals the story of some outstanding crackers and hackers on C64, SNES, Megadrive (Genesis), Amiga and especially on the Atari ST. Relive the best computer times and experience the exceptional methods of famous code breakers, disk dealers, software pirates and law makers in the 1990s. All book shots taken from “The Gold Rush” (see examples under the video).Book Quality

In the 90s, the data lines ran hot and cracked games became a global business. During this period, European groups began to intensify their relationship with the American boards... Alongside Elitendo, the International Cracking Service (ICS) swings into action with a lucrative Atari ST and SNES offering. The BBS board gains astonishing popularity. Especially inside the US-Atari scene, a “modem war” breaks out. To everyone’s surprise, the mastermind is a woman. Dark City of Fear, Maximum Overdrive, Pipeline and Black SnowSTorm – as the boards are called here – try to fight back.Meanwhile in France, in the midst of the French gaming boom, a group of teenagers find the door to a new world. They meet in the schoolyard to form a computer alliance. The story of Fuzion is the real-life tale of Atari freaks reaching out for “the stars”. Their role models are Replicants and Blade Runners and when they join forces via the French RTEL, the world of Orion, Ellfire and Cameo is turned upside down.... Between the stalls of the Barras, we also meet Zippy again, together with Birdy and the Scottish traders. We track down what would remain untold and continue to hang on to The Medway Boys, Automation, Pompey Pirates and the British way of cracking. We also tell of Italian opulence, of a swapper centre in a villa and of Mafiasoft, of Swiss affairs and fake AT&T calling cards, of the computer paradise Poland with its liberal laws, and of special Amiga copiers on black markets.CRACKERS II makes the 90s computer world tangible and separates the wheat (elite) from the chaff (lamer). American distribution is redefined and cracking is questioned by the crackers themselves. The book wanders across continents and proves the global basis of the illegal umbrella organisations. From the disk market and BBS Boards to console trading, we move through space and time and report on perhaps the biggest piracy coup of all time. Dive back into the world of BBS headquarters and their persecution to experience how the notorious German software lawyer Günter von Gravenreuth infiltrates the Amiga scene with its strictly monitored boards – told through the eyes of an anonymous defector with extraordinary espionage qualities. What remains at the end of software piracy? What is the conclusion of the crackers? What have they done with their lives? “The Data Storm” takes stock. Interview partners The following scene and IT experts contributed to both books, either as informants or interview partners:

 ... and many more Overview In the following section we introduce the main topics of “The Data Storm”. They will accompany the narrative which is driven by the many interviews with protagonists of the cracking scene. When Cracking became popular ... A blazing C64 nostalgia tour written by David Almer.The passionate editor of the Swedish magazines Axess and Aorta has published numerous articles in Datormagazin Retro. He also knows everything about Genesis Project: The largest cross-platform collaboration among the most productive C64 cracking groups was founded in the late 80s and is still active. As a true insider, Almer tells you the story that made cracking so popular.The colourful flashback to formative groups and cracktros of Fairlight, Eagle Soft Incorp., Radwar, Dynamic Duo, Hotline, Mr. Z, Strike Force, Triad, Yeti, 1001, ABC, Ikari and others ... The Dark Net of the 90sThey break out of their teenage rooms.In the 90s, many cracker groups and organisations merge into larger umbrella organisations: MCA, Hotline, Blade Runners and The Empire for instance become Elite and not only crack computer software and games, but also deal with the growing console market.The trend towards internationalisation can be seen everywhere and a hot race for the fastest availability in the growing modem networks is about to begin.... Copy MarketsThe mysterious traders from The Barras.You could get anything here. A cheap disk copy for a few pounds? Cracked behind the counter with hardware copier? No problem. The journey through perhaps Europe’s most famous floppy disk market of the last century also takes up a considerable part of Episode Two. We not only learn more about the adventures of Zippy and the Medway Boys, but also follow the Amiga scene through the dodgy corridors of Glasgow.CRACKERS II jumps into contemporary events and lets the reader experience what it was like at such markets. Menu MachinesThe Kings of Menu Disks.The British were the masters of the Compact Menu. Groups and organisations like Medway Boys, Cynix, Pompey Pirates and Automation competed for the fastest release and invented highly optimised compression algorithms that far surpassed those of the games industry. Especially on the Atari ST, this menu scene flourished and spawned numerous imitators (beginnings in Episode One).Those who could automate everything to the greatest possible extent were ahead of the game. Spirit of SwappingA notorious underground report by Stranger of Hemoroids/Rebels. The former French swapper and pack disk editor stood with both feet firmly planted in the ST and Amiga scene for many years. He took a key position. It was then that an individual called Stranger popped up everywhere and became a central figure of the early European file-sharing scene.As part of numerous trading groups Stranger gives a deep insight into the business and communication of the 90s diskette dealers. Rise of the computer classThe story of hacking and cracking is full of little side stories.We’ve been talking to the insiders. Fuzion were one of them. We tell the incredible story of a group of teenage Frenchmen who met in the school playground to realise their dream of a small Atari ST cracker group, getting deeper and deeper into a black market business of international scale. Read how a couple of schoolboys became the best-connected cracker group of their time, surpassing even their role models: The Replicants. Come along for another journey down to the cracker’s ground. US Modem WarsThe illegal race for intelligence, speed and distribution went on.In the U.S. Little Lulu’s was the transshipment point for European cracks. But how were the boards operated and who were the SysOps behind such strange aliases? ​ST Amigos, ST Bandits, The Revolution, T.O.I, Nokturnal, The Big Four, ICS – to name but a few. With the help of Europe’s cracker elite, the rapid transatlantic availability of cracks became a global business model.The US Modem Wars was led by a woman. Read the whole story in The Data Storm. BBS WorldWritten by Troed, a former SysOp of the International Cracking Service. When night fell, Bulletin Boards became a mysterious meeting point for hackers. They developed into the first interactive network of the computer scene. But with modem speeds of less than 10,000 baud, downloading the latest software was a test of patience.FidoNet, Blue Boxing, Calling Cards – high phone bills had to be avoided and the darkest hours used to minimize costs. The Italian affairThe Italian conspiration went a step further.The Italian Cracking Service evolved from the C64 and Amiga scene, expanded its influence and became the International Cracking Service with a princely offer to all supporters. Mr Fly has a name. Even the best French crackers paid their respects and visit the Italian master. The Italian  conspiration reached far into the retail sector and allowed the cracker groups a special way of marketing.CRACKERS II takes a trip to Southern Europe to show how the local scene operated through the loopholes of the Italian laws. Protections on Amiga and Atari STAn exclusive dossier by Denis Lechevallier, today’s cybersecurity expert and former Atari ST/Amiga owner.In an extensive special section, Denis Lechevallier deciphers the common copy protection techniques of its time. Using well-known computer games and exemplary copying methods (see X-Copy), he shows how the mechanisms worked and what was possible at the time to protect a diskette against piracy. Gravenreuth & PartnerThe software law in Germany.Günter Freiherr von Gravenreuth and his law firm rigorously prosecuted juvenile delinquents. CRACKERS II now goes deeper into the mind of Mr Gravenreuth as a person and reveals how the master drove his persecution game through the cracker scene. It is the true and captivating story of an Amiga veteran who perfidiously took down his ancestral scene. What kind of person was behind the Gravenreuth partner?Based on “Hackerland” and “Hackertales” by Denis Moschitto and Evrim Sen.    ASCII ArtA cross scene feature by Senser (SNS), French ASCII artist. Developed mainly through restrictions on low data transmission in the bulletin boards more and more Ascii images evolved. Logos and graphics made with the character set only. Senser talks about the difference of the Atari and Amiga character sets, the restrictions and the signature character of the hardly considered graphic art. His works have been published widely and on numerous systems since 1994: ST, Amiga, Falcon, Windows and MS-DOS.The book shows the most outstanding ASCII works with explanations in a special section. Console CopiersGood diskware and games worth cracking became increasingly rare in the 90s. Many groups decided to set up their own video console departments. The 16-bit console market exploded and showed the savvy Atari and Amiga coders what was possible with the right bit power and special chips. Elitendo, for example, specialised in Sega Megadrive copies while others jumped on the Super Nintendo wagon.We reveal the copy road that took in the entire Eurasian region and required a sophisticated import business. International RaidsMountains of 3.5 inch floppy disks were hidden deep in cellars.Copy stations, copy parties and copy sessions spread “warez” first all over Europe, and then across the world. As these copies were spreading like a virus, the law struck. Wherever you turned, you could be betrayed. Paranoia took hold. The hunt for “software pirates” had begun and The Criminal Police Organisation searched for the private homes of well-known dealers in international operational raids.Read about the consequences of illegal diskette trading in the age of home computers and video consoles. Amiga WorldBlack market deal: Amiga games. We have dug up the best Barras anecdotes of the 90s. Especially on the Amiga, the cracker scene was organised in huge groups that were internationally intertwined operating with staff positions in large US companies. Calling cards flourished and were thrown into the scene en masse at knock-down prices.CRACKERS II unravels the background of what is probably the biggest calling card scam in history, involving, among others, the prominent hacker Kim Dotcom. When Demo infected Cracktro ...Art gallery of formative cracktros and menus.We look at the iconic side of cracktros and search for decisive works with formative aesthetics and technology and present the changes over time. The demo scene was known for extremely efficient machine code, which also challenged the cracktro scene and vis-à-vis. Intros became demos and demos became full-blown menus with joystick control.CRACKERS II features a gallery of classic Atari ST screens. Interview sectionWhy did I crack? We checked and analysed the hot answers of the former crackers for the story. In a large interview section, CRACKERS II also introduces the people behind the stories. We show the faces of today’s IT and security experts who struggled in their youth to undermine protective mechanisms. What was the motivation to crack and distribute all these games? What did these guys take away for their lives? How do they look back on their computer times? Read more in the 50-page interview section for both books. Has Piracy killed 16-bit Games?ST/Amiga Format, ST Action, ACE, ST Magazine, Génération 4, Happy Computer, Power Play, ASM – above all, the game-concentrated magazines sought ways to address the scene and encouraged young buyers to maintain the games market and their jobs. What impact has piracy had on the programming market and computer sales? Undertake a press analysis with us – we ask the industry experts for facts and figures. CRACKERS GoodiesNow let us have a look at the goodies which you are going to get with the different backing options. The following pictures are made for illustration purposes and show the different packages which are tied to the perks.

Born in the mid-70s, I grew up with vinyl and cassettes as well as consoles and home computers, including Atari VCS, Magnavox Odyssey II, Commodore 64, Amiga and Atari ST. I was active in the ST demo scene as a pixel artist for about five years. After the home computer crash, I studied communication design and worked as web designer and video editor. I have been writing since 2008, first as a freelance online editor, then as a full-time magazine editor for audio, music, computer networks and digital topics. In 2016 I founded Microzeit to work on high quality books with a professional design. Proofreading is done by a native speaker and the text is re-edited by a another journalist with US experience.Thanks to the support of a strong community, I was able to realise some amazing retrospectives of our computer youth.  Great graphic icons used on this page:

</div></div>","Story of My Book
Finding the Alpenglow is about the lessons learned on my spiritual journey navigating bipolar disorder without medication. A story complete with highs and lows and what has helped keep me moving forward and thriving.My name is Kate Arredondo, and I am the author of Finding the Alpenglow. I wrote this book because I want others struggling with their mental health to know their life matters. While there will be ups and downs, this book shows that anyone can find personal happiness from simple, everyday joys.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will connect with my story and the key lessons I have learned that will help you move from coping to thriving with your mental health. I want to instill in you the same passion and excitement I have for life, nature and my support system. Ultimately, my stories in this book are meant to give you hope that mental stability is possible and that you can overcome the internal and external stigma around your mental illness just like I have.In this book, you'll learn about my spiritual growth, and the ups and downs that come with bipolar disorder. You'll hear stories such as...
Solo hiking in the mountains of Colorado and realizing I’ve forgotten a vital piece of my equipment. Do I turn back?
My experience having COVID during one of the worst winter storms Texas has ever seen.
Losing a significant portion on my family’s monthly income at the start of the COVID pandemic and then deciding to take a financial risk the very next month.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>It started at an orgy in France. Eunice met Franklin’s boundless optimism, Franklin met Eunice’s propensity towards gleeful and creative sadism, the predictable happened. Fast forward eight years to another orgy and we decided to write a book together!</p>
<p>And that’s where the magic started.</p>
<p>Last year, we asked for your help in developing a new genre of erotic fiction that tore down genre walls, and you responded. You responded with extraordinary enthusiasm, in fact! So much so that our first book, The Brazen Altar, was a huge success...despite being <strong>banned by Amazon</strong> for sexual content. So thank you all so much! It was a humbling experience.</p>
<p>Now let's see if we can do it a second time!</p>
<p>In Divine Burdens, the sequel to The Brazen Altar, we revisit the world of the Passionate Pantheon, with its advanced technology, AI gods, and ritual group sex. But this book takes things in a new direction. Where Divine Burdens was a lighthearted Utopian novel of sacrifice for sex and connection and joy, Divine Burdens looks at what happens when we twist the setting to erotic horror.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1625179380/fug13erzamoo2bwvcxeo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>In this book, you get to see a different City than in <i>The Brazen Altar</i>. It has kink, it has AIs who are worshipped as gods, it has a far-future, post-scarcity society...but this City also has <strong>tentacles</strong>! Because it isn't erotic horror without tentacles, am I right?</p>
<p>Come to <a href=""https://www.passionatepantheon.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.passionatepantheon.com</a> to learn more about the world!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Like the first book, this book is weird. And like the first book, this book stubbornly refuses to be categorized into any convenient niche.</p>
<p>When we first shopped <i>The Brazen Altar</i> around to publishers, we kept hearing the same thing again and again: ""People who buy erotica like one thing. Readers of gay cowboy erotica won't buy bisexual cowboy erotica. Fans of kinky lesbian mechanics don’t hunger after kinky gay school teachers. Vampire erotica readers don’t reach for the werewolf books. You can't sell erotic fiction that can't be categorized.""</p>
<p>Our first novel proved that “wisdom” wrong, and now we want to go on tearing down the silos. We’re going to prove it wasn’t a fluke.</p>
<p>Tentacles! Forests that bend to the will of the AI gods! Sacred parasites that make their home inside a host and secrete powerful aphrodisiacs! Ritual erotic combat in public arenas alongside ferocious, equally erotic gambling! A Temple run entirely by exiles! There's a lot going on in this book.</p>
<p>What do you, dear backers, get from all this?</p>
<p>An erotic book unlike anything you've read before, in your hands before publication date. Kazoo ball gags modeled after one of the drones on the cover of the book (because who doesn't love a bit of laughter with their kink, amirite?). All kinds of other goodies, like a poster of the cover, stickers, leather bookmarks, and a chance to have the two of us join you for virtual tea.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>We love writing. We love writing weird, kinky, geeky, post-scarcity, queer smut.</p>
<p>Most of all, we love variety. And we think the world doesn't have enough of that. We want to explore fiction that's exuberant, messy, unashamed, and not easy to pigeonhole.</p>
<p>We also think that science fiction is best when it asks questions about the human condition. We used <i>Divine Burdens</i> to ask: What is the nature of consent? What happens in a society that's built on a foundation of consent but takes a highly technical, transactional view of what “consent” means? And how can we address these questions...through the medium of really hot sex?</p>
<p>Remember how everyone used to think fantasy novels were only for kids and those who never quite grew up, then suddenly serious authors started showing that the medium can be used in decidedly grown-up ways to tell stories with decidedly grown-up, complex, thought-provoking ideas? We'd like to do the same thing for erotica.</p>
<p>Ambitious, we know. But there it is. (We did wonder if part of the reason <i>The Brazen Altar</i> was banned from Amazon while titles like <i>Daddy Don't Pull Out</i> are apparently totally okay is because we're doing more than just titillating the reader? Though of course we hope we're doing that, too.)</p>
<p>So we'd like your help in proving there's a market for that.</p>
<p>And a market for kazoo ball gags, too, though that's more a side gig.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The book is coming out. Come hell or high water, it <i>will</i> publish in October. Your support for this crowdfunding will help determine how many books the publisher will print. That will determine whether the price will be affordable to more people and also whether it will get into stores and libraries that will enable others to find it.</p>
</div><div>

</div></div>","Short Summary
It started at an orgy in France. Eunice met Franklin’s boundless optimism, Franklin met Eunice’s propensity towards gleeful and creative sadism, the predictable happened. Fast forward eight years to another orgy and we decided to write a book together!
And that’s where the magic started.
Last year, we asked for your help in developing a new genre of erotic fiction that tore down genre walls, and you responded. You responded with extraordinary enthusiasm, in fact! So much so that our first book, The Brazen Altar, was a huge success...despite being banned by Amazon for sexual content. So thank you all so much! It was a humbling experience.
Now let's see if we can do it a second time!
In Divine Burdens, the sequel to The Brazen Altar, we revisit the world of the Passionate Pantheon, with its advanced technology, AI gods, and ritual group sex. But this book takes things in a new direction. Where Divine Burdens was a lighthearted Utopian novel of sacrifice for sex and connection and joy, Divine Burdens looks at what happens when we twist the setting to erotic horror.

In this book, you get to see a different City than in The Brazen Altar. It has kink, it has AIs who are worshipped as gods, it has a far-future, post-scarcity society...but this City also has tentacles! Because it isn't erotic horror without tentacles, am I right?
Come to www.passionatepantheon.com to learn more about the world!

What We Need & What You Get
Like the first book, this book is weird. And like the first book, this book stubbornly refuses to be categorized into any convenient niche.
When we first shopped The Brazen Altar around to publishers, we kept hearing the same thing again and again: ""People who buy erotica like one thing. Readers of gay cowboy erotica won't buy bisexual cowboy erotica. Fans of kinky lesbian mechanics don’t hunger after kinky gay school teachers. Vampire erotica readers don’t reach for the werewolf books. You can't sell erotic fiction that can't be categorized.""
Our first novel proved that “wisdom” wrong, and now we want to go on tearing down the silos. We’re going to prove it wasn’t a fluke.
Tentacles! Forests that bend to the will of the AI gods! Sacred parasites that make their home inside a host and secrete powerful aphrodisiacs! Ritual erotic combat in public arenas alongside ferocious, equally erotic gambling! A Temple run entirely by exiles! There's a lot going on in this book.
What do you, dear backers, get from all this?
An erotic book unlike anything you've read before, in your hands before publication date. Kazoo ball gags modeled after one of the drones on the cover of the book (because who doesn't love a bit of laughter with their kink, amirite?). All kinds of other goodies, like a poster of the cover, stickers, leather bookmarks, and a chance to have the two of us join you for virtual tea.

The Impact
We love writing. We love writing weird, kinky, geeky, post-scarcity, queer smut.
Most of all, we love variety. And we think the world doesn't have enough of that. We want to explore fiction that's exuberant, messy, unashamed, and not easy to pigeonhole.
We also think that science fiction is best when it asks questions about the human condition. We used Divine Burdens to ask: What is the nature of consent? What happens in a society that's built on a foundation of consent but takes a highly technical, transactional view of what “consent” means? And how can we address these questions...through the medium of really hot sex?
Remember how everyone used to think fantasy novels were only for kids and those who never quite grew up, then suddenly serious authors started showing that the medium can be used in decidedly grown-up ways to tell stories with decidedly grown-up, complex, thought-provoking ideas? We'd like to do the same thing for erotica.
Ambitious, we know. But there it is. (We did wonder if part of the reason The Brazen Altar was banned from Amazon while titles like Daddy Don't Pull Out are apparently totally okay is because we're doing more than just titillating the reader? Though of course we hope we're doing that, too.)
So we'd like your help in proving there's a market for that.
And a market for kazoo ball gags, too, though that's more a side gig.

Risks & Challenges
The book is coming out. Come hell or high water, it will publish in October. Your support for this crowdfunding will help determine how many books the publisher will print. That will determine whether the price will be affordable to more people and also whether it will get into stores and libraries that will enable others to find it.

Other Ways You Can Help

Tell folks whom you definitely don’t want as friends, but who might want to have a good old-fashioned bonfire (we’ll do them a bulk discount)!

<h3>1. The Mission of Let's Stab Caesar!</h3>
<p>Let’s Stab Caesar! is an anti-elitist magazine dedicated to publishing art with fangs. In an economy driven by the capital interest of the few, all of culture is bound up with who controls resources and who dictates what has value. There are many brilliant artists (poets, photographers, hybrid creatives) with visions of a new artistic future, creating work that is novel, ecstatic, and has the potential to upturn the elite stranglehold on the art industry, but these artists are often constrained by a lack of resources and/or by the fact that the elite art industry is not interested in them. With this in mind, I wanted to establish a platform for artists who might otherwise be neglected by other publications, and to specifically showcase art that challenges mainstream standards and opens up space for new connective possibilities, community building, and openly anti-capital politics.</p>
<p>The structure of modern life is such that we hardly feel purposeful or fulfilled by our work, our interactions with people, or the institutions which govern us. This is why I find public art to be such a necessary endeavor, where we can still find meaning and beauty amid the monotony. Art is for everyone, and it has the potential to revolutionize—just not when it’s privatized, sterilized, and reduced to the level of commodity by a culture industry that’s funded by and made to serve an elite class (look no further than the Iowa Writers’ Workshop as proof of this, which was funded by CIA front groups to ensure “the spread of anti-Communist propaganda through highbrow literature”). This magazine is made to serve the public; it is for the throngs of people who normally, in their day-to-day life, might not pick up a magazine, and for those who feel dissatisfied with the art world and its failure to bring value to our lives.</p>
<h3>2. On the Structure of the Magazine</h3>
<p>The political bearing of Let’s Stab Caesar! is explicitly anti-elitist, anti-imperialist, and anti-commodity; we have attempted to structure the magazine itself to reflect these politics. There are no hierarchical divisions among the masthead positions (e.g. “managing editor,” “associate editor,” etc.). Instead, we have adopted a horizontal model where each editor’s contributions hold equal weight.</p>
<p>In terms of submissions, we never charge a submission fee and we do not place any limitations on genre or form, since these imposed categories serve only to limit the possibilities of art in order to make the work more marketable. We do not rely on advertisers, which frees us from the constraints on content that advertising companies perpetuate. Each issue will be accessible at no cost to the public on our website, with free print copies distributed in certain public locations, while print copies will also be available for purchase. </p>
<h3>3. Why We're Crowdfunding &amp; Where It's Going</h3>
<p>Because of the fact that we are not accepting money from advertisers or private investors, and because we (the editorial team) do not have personal wealth to invest in the project, we will need to rely on voluntary funding to help us cover initial production costs. This will ensure that our magazine is primarily funded by and for a public audience, and that we can provide a platform for artists that isn't influenced by the sway of advertisers and other ridiculous marketing schemes.</p>
<p><u><strong>Our goal is to reach $300</strong></u>, but the platform has a minimum goal of $500. Anything over $300 will be put towards the second issue. The costs basically come down to printing and distribution. Printing the physical issues will cost at least $200. The rest of the money we collect will go towards shipping and website hosting costs. </p>
<p>Of course, if you can't contribute anything financially, no worries! Still, it would be much appreciated if you could share our fundraiser, spread the word, and check out our Instagram page @letsstabcaesar and website (bit.ly/letsstabcaesar) for updates on our launch. We'd love for you to be a part of this project in whatever way you can.</p>
<p>Get in, loser. We're going to stab Caesar.</p>

<p>So many authors are in despair. Stories live in their hearts and minds, but they do not know what to do to make their dream become reality.</p>
<p>As an editor, I noticed that 90% of what I was telling my better writers was the same three things. <br/><br/>This course is based on those things. It has been designed to help you learn the secrets the best authors already know about how to captivate your readers and bring your stories to life.</p>
<p>To this end, Superversive Press wants to provide courses on how to write—providing all the tools you need to bring your writing up to the next level!  Our first course is: </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong><i>The Art and Craft of Writing</i></strong><br/> </p>
<p>Books are enchanting. They are like a draught of strong wine. A good story sweeps us off our feet and carries us to true love, to far off places, to Narnia or Barsoom. With stories, we can reach others, lift them out of sorrow, sometimes even sway the course of lives, or nations.</p>
<p>All authors yearn to bring to vivid life the stories that burn deep within their hearts. They wish not only to see them given life but also to share them and, perhaps, touch the heart of another.</p>
<p> This course will teach you to bring those stories to life!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What Our Students Are Saying:</h3>
<p>Here are some responses from students who have taken the in-person version of The Art and Craft of Writing :</p>
<p><i>“The course is a treasure trove of practical, positive advice you can use immediately to improve your WIP or solidify your ideas for a new project.” author Marina Fontaine</i></p>
<p><i>“I  took L. Jagi Lamplighter Wright's ""Guinea Pig"" writing class last November and it definitely upped my game. Since ""graduating"" her course, I've sold six short stories and am now working on my first novel. Thanks, Jagi.” James Pyles</i></p>
<p><i>""I especially liked how you simply laid out ideas about story and characters, which instantly made me go ""Oh, yeah! I've seen that before!"". ... </i><i style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">I felt that these were techniques that would have taken me ages to work out on my own, and seeing them simply stated has seriously helped me as a writer.""  Billy Charlton</i></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What We Need:</h3>
</div><div>
<p>In order to make this course available for everyone, we need to produce the videos first:</p>
<ul>
<li>We have an excellent narrator for our project. You can hear him in the promo film, but Guild Actors need to be paid!</li>
<li>Our hard-working video team needs funds for images and graphics, not to mention food.</li>
<li>Plus there may be some cost involved in delivering the videos to consumers in an easy and streamlined fashion.</li>
<li>Right now, we are just producing videos for downloading. If the campaign does unexpectedly well, we might possibly be able to also offer DVDs.</li>
<li>If anything is left over, once all the videos are made, we would love to do some advertising, to help struggling authors everywhere learn about these helpful tools.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stretch Goals:</h3>
<ul>
<li>$2000 -- Fully Funded. Our first four videos will be a go!</li>
<li>$3000 -- Two more videos! <br/>Rewards: bonus video for Scribbler and above by successful author and comic book publisher Jon Del Arroz about surviving today's market--ads, marketing, and the like.</li>
<li>$4000 -- Two more videos!<br/>Reward bonus will include a copy of the excellent Geek Gab episode with Nick Cole (excellent information on the current marketing landscape) and, we are excited to announce, a bonus video of author DJ Butler discussing worldbuilding. (If you have not heard Mr. Butler speak, you are in for a treat.)</li>
<li>$5000 -- Should we reach this point, there will be more to come!</li>
</ul>
<h3>  </h3>
<h3>What The Course Entails:</h3>
<p><i>The Art and Craft of Writing</i> consists of nearly two dozen short classes, but our initial goals are humble. We hope to turn the first four classes into videos that you can replay as many times as you like.</p>
<p>The First Four Classes:</p>
<p><i><strong>The Story -- Engaging Openings</strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>The Character – Breathing Life into Your Characters</strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>The Trick -- The Secret to all Storytelling</strong></i></p>
<p><i><strong>The Story – To Anticipate or Not to Anticipate!</strong></i></p>

So many authors are in despair. Stories live in their hearts and minds, but they do not know what to do to make their dream become reality.
As an editor, I noticed that 90% of what I was telling my better writers was the same three things. This course is based on those things. It has been designed to help you learn the secrets the best authors already know about how to captivate your readers and bring your stories to life.
To this end, Superversive Press wants to provide courses on how to write—providing all the tools you need to bring your writing up to the next level!  Our first course is: 
The Art and Craft of Writing 
Books are enchanting. They are like a draught of strong wine. A good story sweeps us off our feet and carries us to true love, to far off places, to Narnia or Barsoom. With stories, we can reach others, lift them out of sorrow, sometimes even sway the course of lives, or nations.
All authors yearn to bring to vivid life the stories that burn deep within their hearts. They wish not only to see them given life but also to share them and, perhaps, touch the heart of another.
 This course will teach you to bring those stories to life!
 
What Our Students Are Saying:
Here are some responses from students who have taken the in-person version of The Art and Craft of Writing :
“The course is a treasure trove of practical, positive advice you can use immediately to improve your WIP or solidify your ideas for a new project.” author Marina Fontaine
“I  took L. Jagi Lamplighter Wright's ""Guinea Pig"" writing class last November and it definitely upped my game. Since ""graduating"" her course, I've sold six short stories and am now working on my first novel. Thanks, Jagi.” James Pyles
""I especially liked how you simply laid out ideas about story and characters, which instantly made me go ""Oh, yeah! I've seen that before!"". ... I felt that these were techniques that would have taken me ages to work out on my own, and seeing them simply stated has seriously helped me as a writer.""  Billy Charlton
 
What We Need:

In order to make this course available for everyone, we need to produce the videos first:

We have an excellent narrator for our project. You can hear him in the promo film, but Guild Actors need to be paid!
Our hard-working video team needs funds for images and graphics, not to mention food.
Plus there may be some cost involved in delivering the videos to consumers in an easy and streamlined fashion.
Right now, we are just producing videos for downloading. If the campaign does unexpectedly well, we might possibly be able to also offer DVDs.
If anything is left over, once all the videos are made, we would love to do some advertising, to help struggling authors everywhere learn about these helpful tools.

Stretch Goals:

$2000 -- Fully Funded. Our first four videos will be a go!
$3000 -- Two more videos! Rewards: bonus video for Scribbler and above by successful author and comic book publisher Jon Del Arroz about surviving today's market--ads, marketing, and the like.
$4000 -- Two more videos!Reward bonus will include a copy of the excellent Geek Gab episode with Nick Cole (excellent information on the current marketing landscape) and, we are excited to announce, a bonus video of author DJ Butler discussing worldbuilding. (If you have not heard Mr. Butler speak, you are in for a treat.)
$5000 -- Should we reach this point, there will be more to come!

  
What The Course Entails:
The Art and Craft of Writing consists of nearly two dozen short classes, but our initial goals are humble. We hope to turn the first four classes into videos that you can replay as many times as you like.
The First Four Classes:
The Story -- Engaging Openings
The Character – Breathing Life into Your Characters
The Trick -- The Secret to all Storytelling
The Story – To Anticipate or Not to Anticipate!
 What is it all actually about?
A bit of a glimpse:
Open Active:    One opening technique is to start scene changes underway and then explain how you got there…unless the change is significant.
Character Dynamics:  To make a character come to life, give him two conflicting goals. Also, add a scene where he shows a trait at odds with his main traits—this has the same effect in print that shading does in an illustration. It adds a sense of three-dimensionality.
The Trick:    Raising expectations in one direction but having the story go in the opposite direction. It sounds simple, but it may be the most useful writing technique of all…the book Rebecca by Daphne du Maurier is just the trick over and over again. 
The Power of Anticipation:  Think we'll stop here. We have to save something for the actual video.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Iberian Claim</i> is the true story of a Spanish expedition that fails miserably. As Alvar Núñez and his fellow survivors come to terms with their fate, they are forced to question the morality of colonization.<br/><br/>My name is Vincent Casciani and I am the author of <i>Iberian Claim</i>. I was inspired to write this book during a sixth grade history project. The story of Alvar Núñez hooked me and never let go.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading the novel, you will discover more truths about North America’s history. I want <i>Iberian Claim</i> to help impart valuable personal lessons of the past to our present day.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Book</h3>
<p>Alvar Núñez is a war veteran stuck in an unsatisfying administrative job. He trades his mundane life for an expedition to La Florida, hoping he can gain status and recognition. Accompanying him are Captain Castillo, an over-educated doctor’s son looking for adventure, and Estevanico, an observant Moroccan brought against his will. Their superior is the Governor, a man with a chip on his shoulder and a desire to outperform other conquistadors. He ultimately wants to conquer La Florida and bring all its native peoples under Spanish control. His ambitions are a recipe for disaster.<br/><br/>Mistake after mistake is made until any chance for success is lost. Alvar Núñez, the Governor, and the rest of the expedition soon realize they are at the mercy of this unfamiliar land. Reaching Spanish-controlled western territories quickly becomes their new mission. The surviving Spaniards must learn to swallow their pride in order to survive natural obstacles and acclimate to the existing cultures they mistakenly underestimated.<br/><br/>Will these colonizers learn to genuinely respect the North American land and people, or will they reignite their attempts to take control?</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Who’s the Audience?</h3>
<p>You will love this book if: 1.) you find historical truths fascinating 2.) you appreciate engaging narratives, and 3.) you understand how powerfully history directs our futures.<br/><br/><i>Iberian Claim</i> speaks to history lovers and lifelong learners who want to grapple with colonialism and survival in interesting new ways.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Iberian Claim</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What might I do in a situation similar to this story?</li>
<li>How are we seeing the effects of these past events in our own lives?</li>
<li>Why does the oppression shown in the book repeat itself?</li>
</ul>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing the dynamics of American colonization will change us all for the better.</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>

<h2>The Story of <i>Lost in the Stream</i>
</h2> <h3>My Book Journey</h3>My name is Johnny Savage, and I am the author of <i>Lost in the Stream</i>. I wrote this book to bring others hope. For many years I was afraid to share the most important details of what happened on April 13th, 1998. It was extremely painful to share the story of being lost at sea with no hope to be saved. This event changed the sportfishing industry around the world by showing large custom yachts can sink within minutes. The event helped crews to realize the importance of having life-safety gear ready and available.<br/><br/>I was often told, “Johnny, you have to write a book this.”<br/><br/>During the summer of 2012, I was faced with the ultimate fear of losing my family. While in the middle of a severe depression that took all the value out of life, I fell to my knees and cried out to the Lord. It was like I was lost at sea once again. I needed to know that I was not alone. Then, I received a clear direction from the Lord in that prayer.<br/><br/>“It’s time to tell My story.”<br/><br/>I replied, “Lord, I’m not into glorifying myself.”<br/><br/>His response was, “You aren’t glorifying you. You are glorifying Me.”<br/><br/>In Lost in the Stream, I will bring you into the water with the crew of the Anhinga as we fought to survive in the sea ninety miles off the coast of Key West, Florida. The Anhinga sank so quickly, there was not enough time to sound a distress call or get the life-raft, emergency beacon, or life jackets. No one knew the Anhinga was taken by the overwhelming power of the sea. We were alone. Microscopic in comparison to the vastness of the open water, with no land or other vessels in sight. The crew did not know of the miraculous rescue that would occur in the middle of a storm while adrift in the Gulf Stream.<br/><br/><br/>My hope is that in reading this book you will have the faith and endurance to persevere the storms or struggles that may come into your life. One of the greatest challenges in writing this book was to define the audience. Initially, I thought the audience would be outdoor enthusiasts. I was wrong; everyone will love this book. Everyone needs hope.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Lost in the Stream </i>inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:<ul>
<li>What are the thoughts that go through the mind knowing you are going to die by drowning or being eaten alive by sharks?</li>
<li>How strong is the will to survive?</li>
<li>Do miracles really happen and is God real?</li>
</ul>
<br/>I’m not a preacher — I am just a fisherman that did not deserve to be saved. But I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with you. Through questions, I have been given closure to the pain and seen how this story has been used to give hope. I believe discussing these themes and exploring these questions will change us all for the better.<br/> <h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I am continuously humbled by the impact the story of the Anhinga has on an audience. In this book I share some of the amazing stories of lives changed as a result of various speaking engagements. In writing this book, I have spent a great deal of time reflecting on various elements of the story where audiences have provided positive feedback on how it’s touched their lives. The main purpose of this book is to help others. In 1998, the response to what happened to the crew of the Anhinga was unanimously: ""God saved those boys out there.""<br/><br/>There were several options available for publishing this book. I learned that in typical publishing, the publisher owns the rights to the book and can change whatever they desire in order to sell more books. God truly did save Captain Eric and I out there. I absolutely do not want to give a publisher the ability to remove God from the story. That is why I have selected a hybrid publishing option with crowdfunding for this book.<br/><br/>Some of you already know this story and have experienced the tears and joy. Please help me to bring this story to a world that is in need of hope.</p>
<h3>
<br/>About the Author-Capt. Johnny Savage</h3>
<p><br/>Johnny Savage lives in the rural southern area of Virginia Beach with his wife Samantha. They have a son and three daughters who are 4th generation members of Blackwater Baptist Church. Johnny started his fishing career in 1989 working on the head boats out of Rudee Inlet (Virginia Beach, VA) until 1992 when he started working on offshore sportfishing charter boats. While attending ODU (Old Dominion University) he charter fished out of Rudee Inlet and Oregon Inlet (Outer Banks, NC) until completing his Bachelor of Science in Environmental Health and Safety in Dec. of 1996.<br/><br/>After his graduation, Johnny was blessed to serve in the ranks of some of the best sportfishing crews in the world fishing out of Palm Beach, FL. He would go on to fish the east coast of the US, the Bahamas, Mexico, and Bermuda.<br/><br/>Following an accident in 1998, John returned to ODU and charter fishing in the Mid-Atlantic area. In 2001, he obtained his captain’s license from the Chesapeake Marine Training Institute in Hayes, VA. In the same year, Johnny decided to step away from the career that almost killed him and became a safety engineer for the Ford Motor Company. He continued fishing as a freelance captain or mate.<br/><br/>Captain Johnny returned to fishing when Ford’s Norfolk Assembly Plant closed in 2007. His new position was a dream job with the ability to fish and save lives. He was captain of one of the first sixty-foot Viking Yachts- Episode and Safety Director for the boat owner’s company- Asphalt Roads and Materials.<br/><br/>In 2016, Asphalt Roads and Materials was sold to become Virginia Paving Co. where he remains in his safety position. His manager at Virginia Paving Co. realized the power of Johnny’s lost at sea story and included the writing of <i>Lost in the Stream </i>into Johnny’s official professional development plan.

 My Book JourneyMy name is Johnny Savage, and I am the author of Lost in the Stream. I wrote this book to bring others hope. For many years I was afraid to share the most important details of what happened on April 13th, 1998. It was extremely painful to share the story of being lost at sea with no hope to be saved. This event changed the sportfishing industry around the world by showing large custom yachts can sink within minutes. The event helped crews to realize the importance of having life-safety gear ready and available.I was often told, “Johnny, you have to write a book this.”During the summer of 2012, I was faced with the ultimate fear of losing my family. While in the middle of a severe depression that took all the value out of life, I fell to my knees and cried out to the Lord. It was like I was lost at sea once again. I needed to know that I was not alone. Then, I received a clear direction from the Lord in that prayer.“It’s time to tell My story.”I replied, “Lord, I’m not into glorifying myself.”His response was, “You aren’t glorifying you. You are glorifying Me.”In Lost in the Stream, I will bring you into the water with the crew of the Anhinga as we fought to survive in the sea ninety miles off the coast of Key West, Florida. The Anhinga sank so quickly, there was not enough time to sound a distress call or get the life-raft, emergency beacon, or life jackets. No one knew the Anhinga was taken by the overwhelming power of the sea. We were alone. Microscopic in comparison to the vastness of the open water, with no land or other vessels in sight. The crew did not know of the miraculous rescue that would occur in the middle of a storm while adrift in the Gulf Stream.My hope is that in reading this book you will have the faith and endurance to persevere the storms or struggles that may come into your life. One of the greatest challenges in writing this book was to define the audience. Initially, I thought the audience would be outdoor enthusiasts. I was wrong; everyone will love this book. Everyone needs hope.Ultimately, I hope that Lost in the Stream inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:
What are the thoughts that go through the mind knowing you are going to die by drowning or being eaten alive by sharks?
How strong is the will to survive?
Do miracles really happen and is God real?

I’m not a preacher — I am just a fisherman that did not deserve to be saved. But I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with you. Through questions, I have been given closure to the pain and seen how this story has been used to give hope. I believe discussing these themes and exploring these questions will change us all for the better. The Impact
I am continuously humbled by the impact the story of the Anhinga has on an audience. In this book I share some of the amazing stories of lives changed as a result of various speaking engagements. In writing this book, I have spent a great deal of time reflecting on various elements of the story where audiences have provided positive feedback on how it’s touched their lives. The main purpose of this book is to help others. In 1998, the response to what happened to the crew of the Anhinga was unanimously: ""God saved those boys out there.""There were several options available for publishing this book. I learned that in typical publishing, the publisher owns the rights to the book and can change whatever they desire in order to sell more books. God truly did save Captain Eric and I out there. I absolutely do not want to give a publisher the ability to remove God from the story. That is why I have selected a hybrid publishing option with crowdfunding for this book.Some of you already know this story and have experienced the tears and joy. Please help me to bring this story to a world that is in need of hope.

About the Author-Capt. Johnny Savage
Johnny Savage lives in the rural southern area of Virginia Beach with his wife Samantha. They have a son and three daughters who are 4th generation members of Blackwater Baptist Church. Johnny started his fishing career in 1989 working on the head boats out of Rudee Inlet (Virginia Beach, VA) until 1992 when he started working on offshore sportfishing charter boats. While attending ODU (Old Dominion University) he charter fished out of Rudee Inlet and Oregon Inlet (Outer Banks, NC) until completing his Bachelor of Science in Environmental Health and Safety in Dec. of 1996.After his graduation, Johnny was blessed to serve in the ranks of some of the best sportfishing crews in the world fishing out of Palm Beach, FL. He would go on to fish the east coast of the US, the Bahamas, Mexico, and Bermuda.Following an accident in 1998, John returned to ODU and charter fishing in the Mid-Atlantic area. In 2001, he obtained his captain’s license from the Chesapeake Marine Training Institute in Hayes, VA. In the same year, Johnny decided to step away from the career that almost killed him and became a safety engineer for the Ford Motor Company. He continued fishing as a freelance captain or mate.Captain Johnny returned to fishing when Ford’s Norfolk Assembly Plant closed in 2007. His new position was a dream job with the ability to fish and save lives. He was captain of one of the first sixty-foot Viking Yachts- Episode and Safety Director for the boat owner’s company- Asphalt Roads and Materials.In 2016, Asphalt Roads and Materials was sold to become Virginia Paving Co. where he remains in his safety position. His manager at Virginia Paving Co. realized the power of Johnny’s lost at sea story and included the writing of Lost in the Stream into Johnny’s official professional development plan. Each summer he has also had the opportunity to the operate sportfishing boats such as Just One More, Contango, and Desperado.In 2012, the Virginia Beach Billfish Club asked Johnny to come and speak on tactics for marlin fishing. At the end of this speech, one of his former boat-owners asked that he share his story of being lost at sea so he did. It touched hearts. Then Johnny received a call from a friend asking for the story to be shared with other groups. Since then, lives have been saved, changed, and touched by power of the testimony of the Anhinga.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>My name is William Matson. I am the writer of the acclaimed book ""Crazy Horse: The Lakota Warrior's Life and Legacy"" which was written with Crazy Horse family members Floyd Clown, Doug War Eagle, and Don Red Thunder based on their family's oral history. I also have written a personal book about my journey to find them and meet them</strong><strong> entitled ""In My Father's Footsteps"". I am also an award winning documentary film maker. Floyd, Doug, and Don are Lakota grandsons to Old Man Crazy Horse or Waglula and are </strong><b>recipients of their family's oral history as passed down from the time of Crazy Horse.</b>
</li>
<li><strong>We have been very fortunate that so many people from all walks of life have expressed their appreciation after reading our book ""Crazy Horse the Lakota Warrior's Life and Legacy"". While out on our book tour, the Crazy Horse family and I have had many requests for an Audiobook for those who lack the time, patience, or ability to read or have a vision impairment. Floyd, Doug, and Don will add some of our sacred Lakota songs to this Audiobook experience, while our Author, William Matson will add some sound effects to his reading to help bring the text to life. </strong></li>
<li><strong>This is a unique opportunity to help the family and author make a quality recording of the family's oral history. It is also an opportunity to help the family pass it down to their more distant family members living in remote areas of the United States, foreign countries, or those still residing on the reservation. It is an opportunity to breathe life into our written words.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>In order to create a high quality Audiobook, we will need to record it in a studio setting. We estimate the time needed to record will be about 30 hours for 28 chapters and the Forward. Plus the finished recordings will need to be mastered which we estimate to take about 15 hours. We have located a studio where they will allow us to record during off peak hours at $30 per hour for a total of $1350. We will be adding some sound effects. Some sound effects we already own. Some we do not. So we expect our budget for sound effects to be modest at $300. </strong><strong>Thus the total would be $1650. This will produce a digital Audiobook.</strong>
</li>
<li><strong>For the Crazy Horse family members we plan to make 50 hard copies to be distributed to family members which would include about 10-12 CDs, a case, artwork for the outside of the case, and individual plastic sleeves for each CD within the case to keep them from being scratched. The cost of each CD for a run of 50 and labeled to indicate what chapters are contained is $1.92 or $96 for 50 hard copies. When multiplied out to the 10-12 CDs needed that comes to $960 to $1152 total for the CDs alone. Each case costs $3.45 and contains a ring binder for CD sleeves. the cost for 50 cases would be $172.50. The sleeves cost fifteen cents each. At an estimated 10-12 CDs means the cost would be $1.50-$1.80 per case and for 50 cases would be $75-$90. Artwork on the outside cover runs about $800-1000. So the total for the 50 copies would be between $2007.50 to $2414. </strong></li>
<li><strong>The grand total for both the digital copy plus the family copies is $4064. There is a 4.5% state sales tax and a 2% city sales tax for a grand total of 6.5% sales tax or $264. So to complete all we need to complete it will cost $4330. On the $4330, Indiegogo takes a 5% commission plus 5% for collecting the funds to total 10% that we will never see. So we will need to raise $4765. We have rounded it off to $4765 to make it an easy number to remember. </strong></li>
<li><span><strong><i>We are offering not only the digital Audiobook, but our autographed books, our videos, and your name mentioned at the end of the Audiobook. And for three lucky individuals, your name or the name of someone you care about mentioned prior to the Audiobook reading. </i></strong></span></li>
<li><p><strong>If for some reason we fail to raise the full $4765, our first priority will be to finish the digital copy of the Audiobook as best we can. The recording studio would be first priority with mastering the second priority. If we are fortunate enough to raise more than $1650 we will be able to distribute the book to a limited amount of our family members until we have raised the full amount and then we will be able to distribute all 50.</strong></p></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
</div><div><ul>
<li><strong><i>During the late 1800s and the first half of the 1900s a great number of Native American youth were removed from their homes and sent to boarding schools to far away for their parents to visit. Since nearly all their history was oral, these young people lost the opportunity to learn their people's history from. those that lived it. So some stories are lost forever. Stories that dated back to when the descendants of the European settlers still though the world was flat. To reconnect with the North American continent's history teaches us all how things were. And if we don't where we have been then how can we possibly know where we are going in the future. ""Crazy Horse the Lakota Warrior's Life and Legacy"" is the oral family history of the Crazy Horse family. Right now it is in book form. However the spoken form includes the emotion with which it was told. The songs that help them tell it. A chance to feel their history through your ears, just as the children that somehow escaped boarding school heard it and why it is still alive today. To preserve this history in spoken form is to future generations, both born and still unborn. </i></strong></li>
<li><strong>To date we have published the book ""Crazy Horse the Lakota Warrior's Life and Legacy"" and made a four part documentary series on our oral history. Both for the most part have been positively received. We have done a book tour where we stopped in 317 different places to speak, eleven of those in Europe via our good friend Arne Martin Boe. We intend to make this audiobook with the same dedication and quality that we gave to our previous endeavors.</strong></li>
<li><i><strong>We were not always sure how our oral history would be received because nearly all that had been told previously had been told by people from other nations other than our nation. And other families other than ours. So thus far we are humbled by the positive response we have received on our printed book and wish to dedicate this oral history as it was meant to be told, orally, to those who have opened their ears and hearts. Thank you for your support. Our hearts burst with gratitude.</strong></i></li>
</ul></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>For over twenty years we have stayed focused on telling our story not only to our children but to the world. That focus will not waiver in completing this audiobook.</strong></li>
<li>
<strong><i>We are become older by the day. So we will make sure that we find a quality recording studio to make sure our audio is of the highest quality and the words are clear. Nobody knows when our Creator will take us to the other side, so the sooner we can get it recorded and available, the better. Perseverance has been the hallmark of our efforts to preserve our oral history.  Wopila</i></strong>!</li>

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>Today's Superpower: Building Networks</i> is a book that will highlight a set of mindset principles that will enable you to create, join, and leverage the power of networks to innovate and change society.<br/><br/>My name is Mikel Mangold, and I am the author of <i>Today's Superpower: Building Networks</i>. I wrote this book because of several things our society is currently facing: speed of change, the decline of corporate innovation, the decline in employees engagement &amp; motivation, and the rise of agile, dynamic, innovative startups which are challenging the way we do things.<br/><br/>Data shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>According to a 2016 report by Innosight, corporations in the S&amp;P 500 Index in 1965 stayed in the index for an average was of 33 years. By 1990, the average was about 20 years and is now forecast to shrink to 14 years by 2026. (1) </li>
<li>According to a Deloitte US study, made in 2017, only 13% are passionate and engaged at work. (2) </li>
<li>A monumental 1998 study, named Global Theory of Intellectual Change, analyzed the network of philosophers and mathematicians for over two thousand years in both Asian and Western societies. The study showed the innovator's or philosopher's network (their connection with others) was the secret behind the individual’s exceptional creativity. The ability to tap into a social capital to gather ideas is crucial to innovation, but most organizations work in isolation. (3) </li>

<h2>The Book - Today's Superpower: Building Networks</h2>
<p>THE BOOK IS DIVIDED INTO THREE PARTS:<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction + chapters 1-3. This first part is about explaining how we got here; why do we follow timeline and processes? Why do we follow rules? This part is also about explaining how Silicon Valley operates differently: what I have seen and experienced, and what they are doing right.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 4-10. Here you will learn about principles I have detected from successful individuals who created a network around them to drive positive change. All chapters are driven by primary, secondary, and personal stories. In one of the chapters, you will learn how Alice Bosley and Patricia Letayf, co-founders of 51labs, build their resilience in Iraq through their network, how they’ve saved their incubator from closing its doors.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters 11-12. This part is about the closing words and my hope for this book; including the importance of moving outside our silos; getting interdisciplinary exposure and being exposed to diverse minds. I’ll highlight a set of technological and social trends we are starting to see and will continue to accelerate in the coming years.</p>

Story of My Book
Today's Superpower: Building Networks is a book that will highlight a set of mindset principles that will enable you to create, join, and leverage the power of networks to innovate and change society.My name is Mikel Mangold, and I am the author of Today's Superpower: Building Networks. I wrote this book because of several things our society is currently facing: speed of change, the decline of corporate innovation, the decline in employees engagement & motivation, and the rise of agile, dynamic, innovative startups which are challenging the way we do things.Data shows:

According to a 2016 report by Innosight, corporations in the S&P 500 Index in 1965 stayed in the index for an average was of 33 years. By 1990, the average was about 20 years and is now forecast to shrink to 14 years by 2026. (1) 
According to a Deloitte US study, made in 2017, only 13% are passionate and engaged at work. (2) 
A monumental 1998 study, named Global Theory of Intellectual Change, analyzed the network of philosophers and mathematicians for over two thousand years in both Asian and Western societies. The study showed the innovator's or philosopher's network (their connection with others) was the secret behind the individual’s exceptional creativity. The ability to tap into a social capital to gather ideas is crucial to innovation, but most organizations work in isolation. (3) 
79% of employees are leaving their jobs, because their performance has not been recognized. 74% don't feel that they're allowed to challenge something in the meeting. (https://www.ferrazzigreenlight.com/)
During the COVID-19 pandemic; a study in the UK surveyed 2,000 16 to 25-year-olds and showed that more than half (57%) of young people is ‘scared’ about being unemployed, and that 43% are worried that they will never be able to get a job. (4-5)
Companies continue to work in hierarchies and avoid moving outside their own silos when this is exactly what's needed to adapt to the speed of transformation. We need to be connected to others (teams or other companies). This is more important today than it has ever been.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that today's world offers us an incredible opportunity: with available online platforms and today's political and corporate landscape, everyone is able to create networks, including you. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for entrepreneurship and waking up with meaning to make this world a better place. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you focus on collaborating instead of trying to do it alone. Solving big problems can be hard, and I don't want you to give up.In this book, you'll learn about the mindset and principles to adopt to form networks. You'll hear stories such as...
How Naveen Jain, a billionaire I met in the Silicon Valley created his own network and success by being bold, challenging the status quo, and adopting a moonshot mindset
How Gregg Stuar, a UK-based corporate innovator, failed at first and how he pivoted to succeed at launching a new business for his company using the power of networks (bringing a lot of people in to shape the idea).
My own stories and the experiences I had in Silicon Valley. There I discovered what they are doing that the rest of the world is not doing. They succeed as a network; they work ""for Silicon Valley"" and not for their own company.
How a Silicon Valley Venture Capitalist (VC), who mentored me in 2020, build relationships. In the book, I'll share the core principle she uses everyday to create business outcomes.

Today’s Superpower: Building Networks is a nonfiction book that speaks to wantrepreneurs (the ones wanting to become entrepreneurs or adopting an entrepreneurial mindset), and mid-career professionals - looking for a career change - who want to look at innovation and change management in a new way.You will love this book if you are a dreamer, if you want to have an impact in the world, and you want to learn how to build networks around you so people join your mission (inside or outside an organization).

<p>A good magic system draws your audience in, augments the plot, and amplifies important aspects of your story. An incomplete or poorly implemented magic system can have the opposite effect, driving readers away and potentially damaging critical story elements.</p>
<p>This can be intimidating and frustrating because building a magic system and deftly weaving it into a story is hard. It’s a process that’s easy to start but difficult to master and is currently treated as a mystical art.</p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be that way.</p>
<p><strong>Welcome to The Magic System Blueprint</strong>: an eBook and magic-building tool designed to quickly give you a holistic understanding of any magic system. It will help you crack open a system, show you the moving parts, and help you identify what makes one system different from another.</p>
<p>With the Blueprint in hand, we can take a more structured and deliberate approach to building magic systems. This allows us to home in on the most important factors of any magic system, allowing us to build better, more complete magic systems in less time. Once you see how it works, you can build or analyze any magic system imaginable.</p>
<p>In short:<strong> building magic systems is about to get a whole lot easier!</strong></p>

<p><strong>A Heart-Felt Thanks</strong></p>
<p>Honestly, I'm thankful that you're here reading this right now. I am extremely grateful for your time and backing for just a single dollar means so much to me.</p>
<p><strong>Listed in the Acknowledgements</strong></p>
<p>If you backed this project for $5 or more, you've helped raise this book to the next level, and that deserves acknowledgment. With this perk, you will be listed in the front section of the book however you choose (name, pen-name, Twitter handle, discord user name, email, etc).</p>
<p><strong>Book Formats: PDF / Paperback / Hardback</strong></p>
<p>This part is pretty straightforward. <strong>Physical copies can only be shipped to addresses in the United States and Canada.</strong> The hardback edition is currently limited to this campaign as I have no plans to print more in the future. If having a hardback copy matters to you, this may be your only chance.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus Blueprints</strong></p>
<p>The Magic System Blueprint allows you to take a snapshot of the most important attributes of a magic system from a specific point of view and time. By changing this perspective, we can explore a magic system from different angles to turn it into a 3-dimensional, fully realized system.</p>
<p>In the book, we examine the magic of Allomancy from the Mistborn trilogy, the tech from Stargate SG-1, the magic from The Lord of the Rings, and the powers from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>
<p><strong>These bonus blueprints look at each of these systems from new perspectives</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Allomancy: mapped from the Skaa (slave caste) perspective</li>
<li>Stargate SG-1: mapped from the Goa'uld (antagonist) perspective</li>
<li>Lord of the Rings; mapped from Sauron's (antagonist) perspective</li>
<li>Marvel Cinematic Universe: mapped from later in the MCU timeline </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Types of Magic Cheat-Sheet</strong></p>
<p>There's more to the types of magic than just Hard and Soft spectrum. This digital handout serves as a quick reference to explain the different types of magic systems as well as their pros and cons.</p>
<p><strong>Coaching with C. R. Rowenson</strong></p>
<p>If there's anything I love as much as magic systems, it's helping people. I've been coaching writers for years now to help them shore up their magic systems, fix plot problems, and generally smooth out the writing process. If you're stuck with you're writing, I'm here to help. </p>
<p>My coaching usually runs between $75-$125 per hour. As part of the Master Magic-Builder tier, you get one hour of coaching absolutely free.

<p>You might be wondering why this book needs a crowdfunding campaign. It’s already written and will be coming out later in 2021 one way or another. So what’s the point of all this?</p>
<p>Well, publishing a book is expensive. I’m running this campaign to help defray some of these expenses. The funds from this campaign will go directly toward editing, publishing, and advertising for this book to help it reach as many people as possible. </p>
<p><strong>Here’s the breakdown of costs</strong> for publishing a book:</p>
<ul>
<li>Line Edit - $1,000</li>
<li>Proofreading - $500</li>
<li>Book Cover &amp; Images - $300</li>
<li>Interior Design - $500</li>
<li>eBook Design - $500</li>
<li>ISBN - $300 </li>
<li>Copyright and Trademark - $315</li>
<li>Indiegogo Platform fee of 5%</li>
<li>Transaction fee of 2.9%</li>
</ul>
<p>Total: $3,685</p>
<p><strong>My Target: <u>$2,700</u></strong></p>
<p>I’m doing everything I can to minimize expenses without cutting out important steps and/or decreasing the quality of the book. This mostly comes down to bartering, making promotional agreements, and an exchange of my services for someone else's.</p>
<p>In the end, I think I can bring this as low as $2,700 in expenses.</p>
<p> </p>

<p>The name’s C. R. Rowenson. Trained in the dark and mysterious arts of chemistry and chemical engineering, I spend my time blowing things up and spreading chaos. Fortunately for everyone, it’s mostly in my head… mostly.</p>
<p>Over the years I have developed a passion for writing, but I have an even deeper love for magic systems. I love reading them, I love designing them, and I love writing them. If there’s a magic system in a book, game, comic, show, or movie, I am far more likely to give it a go.</p>
<p><strong>I. Love. Magic.</strong></p>
<p>Beyond that, I’m a huge tabletop RPG nut, I’ve trained for a long time in martial arts, and I can’t seem to get enough of Skyrim. I just started a character in Skyrim VR and am having a blast. If you want to get bored quickly, just ask me about my current character and the mods I have installed for his playthrough.</p>

<p>Every shred of support makes a difference, and not just for me but for everyone involved along the way.</p>
<p>I plan on taking every cent made in this campaign and pouring it back into the book. Getting more backing here means I can pay the artists, editors, marketing specialists, and book designers what their expertise is truly worth. Not only that but the more backing we get here, the better the final product and the more people will be exposed to the book.</p>
<p><strong>And The Magic System Blueprint is a game changer!</strong></p>
<p>Magic-building for most people is an unstructured, nebulous thing you practice until it “feels right”. The entire process is based on instinct and hunches. The Blueprint changes that, making the process into something tangible and structured.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I want to see more and better magic systems in our stories. They don’t have to be my magic systems. I don’t want them to be all my magic systems. There are so many storytellers out there that just need a little more structure to bring their marvelous magic system to life.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s make that happen!</strong></p>
<p> </p>

<p>As part of the development and editing of this book, I was fortunate enough to have several test readers that helped find and eliminate confusing, misleading, or erroneous parts of the text. These are what some of them had to say about The Magic System Blueprint.</p>

<p><i>""From the onset, the Magic System Blueprint proved to be a much easier system than I had originally thought. C.R.

</div></div>","A good magic system draws your audience in, augments the plot, and amplifies important aspects of your story. An incomplete or poorly implemented magic system can have the opposite effect, driving readers away and potentially damaging critical story elements.
This can be intimidating and frustrating because building a magic system and deftly weaving it into a story is hard. It’s a process that’s easy to start but difficult to master and is currently treated as a mystical art.
It doesn’t have to be that way.
Welcome to The Magic System Blueprint: an eBook and magic-building tool designed to quickly give you a holistic understanding of any magic system. It will help you crack open a system, show you the moving parts, and help you identify what makes one system different from another.
With the Blueprint in hand, we can take a more structured and deliberate approach to building magic systems. This allows us to home in on the most important factors of any magic system, allowing us to build better, more complete magic systems in less time. Once you see how it works, you can build or analyze any magic system imaginable.
In short: building magic systems is about to get a whole lot easier!
 



A Heart-Felt Thanks
Honestly, I'm thankful that you're here reading this right now. I am extremely grateful for your time and backing for just a single dollar means so much to me.
Listed in the Acknowledgements
If you backed this project for $5 or more, you've helped raise this book to the next level, and that deserves acknowledgment. With this perk, you will be listed in the front section of the book however you choose (name, pen-name, Twitter handle, discord user name, email, etc).
Book Formats: PDF / Paperback / Hardback
This part is pretty straightforward. Physical copies can only be shipped to addresses in the United States and Canada. The hardback edition is currently limited to this campaign as I have no plans to print more in the future. If having a hardback copy matters to you, this may be your only chance.
Bonus Blueprints
The Magic System Blueprint allows you to take a snapshot of the most important attributes of a magic system from a specific point of view and time. By changing this perspective, we can explore a magic system from different angles to turn it into a 3-dimensional, fully realized system.
In the book, we examine the magic of Allomancy from the Mistborn trilogy, the tech from Stargate SG-1, the magic from The Lord of the Rings, and the powers from the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
These bonus blueprints look at each of these systems from new perspectives

Allomancy: mapped from the Skaa (slave caste) perspective
Stargate SG-1: mapped from the Goa'uld (antagonist) perspective
Lord of the Rings; mapped from Sauron's (antagonist) perspective
Marvel Cinematic Universe: mapped from later in the MCU timeline 

Types of Magic Cheat-Sheet
There's more to the types of magic than just Hard and Soft spectrum. This digital handout serves as a quick reference to explain the different types of magic systems as well as their pros and cons.
Coaching with C. R. Rowenson
If there's anything I love as much as magic systems, it's helping people. I've been coaching writers for years now to help them shore up their magic systems, fix plot problems, and generally smooth out the writing process. If you're stuck with you're writing, I'm here to help. 
My coaching usually runs between $75-$125 per hour. As part of the Master Magic-Builder tier, you get one hour of coaching absolutely free. If you'd like to know more about it, you can always check out the information here.


 

The end of the campaign is rapidly approaching, but the opportunities are far from over. The newest one being the Magic System Blueprint Referral Contest!
The rules are simple: using the Indiegogo sharing links, see how much support you can bring in for the campaign. As the contributions from your friends, family, and other referrals pass certain thresholds, you will receive additional rewards.
To get credit for all your referrals, be sure you're logged into your Indiegogo account and use the Indiegogo social media sharing buttons. You can find more details on referrals and being part of a referral contest here.
Referral Rewards

The first tier may seem a little strange, but I know not everyone can afford to back the campaign and wanted them to still have a chance to get the book. All referral contest rewards will be delivered in November at the same time as normal backer rewards.
Additional Rewards May Unlock as Referrals Arrive
 

With each goal reached, I'll use the Magic System Blueprint to map out five more popular magic systems.
These bonus blueprints will be added to the Arcane Adept tier and both Master Magic-Builder tiers. They will also be available to purchase as addons for all other tiers.

Copyright and Trademark - $315
Indiegogo Platform fee of 5%
Transaction fee of 2.9%

Total: $3,685
My Target: $2,700
I’m doing everything I can to minimize expenses without cutting out important steps and/or decreasing the quality of the book. This mostly comes down to bartering, making promotional agreements, and an exchange of my services for someone else's.
In the end, I think I can bring this as low as $2,700 in expenses.

<p>Short Summary</p>Tribe of Men: Understanding How to Evolve Your Masculinity, Find Your Community and Reach Your Potential is about overcoming toxic masculine thoughts and actions by using your strengths to lay the foundations for success. Ultimately, finding your purpose, planning your happiness, and building your resilience muscle.<br/><br/>My name is Michael King Jr., and I am the author of Tribe of Men. I wrote this book to show that in order to find emotional peace, and to maintain a proper work/life balance, Men's mental health matters! I want to help men be relationship ready before they get into commitments, whether social, intimate, or business. I want to show how to heal communities by addressing issues faced by everyday men.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the importance of self care for body, mind, and spirit; to discover the value of mental health. I will show you how to make a plan to become a better king for your kingdom. This book is an opportunity for you to engage with the evolution of cultural norms, escape from patriarchal traditions, and discover a path to your purpose.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you are ready to tackle tough issues in your life! Whether that be bouncing back from a break up or even just stressful life transitions.<br/><br/>Tribe of Men speaks to busy millennials and generation X men who want to grapple with self development and cultural practices in a new way. Ultimately, I hope that Tribe of Men inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pushing you to engage with questions like:<br/>What tools do I need to build my resilience muscle?<br/>How do you deal with issues of insecurity?<br/>How do you create healthy relationships?<br/>Can you confront toxic masculine pride?<br/><br/>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing the power of vulnerability, cultural trauma, and the stigma surrounding mental health will change us all for the better.<br/><br/>The Book - Tribe of Men<br/><br/>The book begins by covering how we got to the point where we are. Next, I show the situations that these issues have lead to. Finally, I close out the book by showing the strategies and mindsets needed to fix the problems we see.<br/><br/>Throughout the book I address issues such as the cult of toxic masculinity, the science behind a growth mindset, and men’s mental health. I hope to express the importance of having conversations relating to these issues and their time sensitive nature.<br/><br/>These issues need to be taken seriously now and not pushed off on the future generation. I hope to challenge traditional views of patriarchy. These traditions appear in our everyday lives and can be a major hinderance to true change. I hope to show that we can use our faith to help administer change and adapt to the ever changing pressures of modern life.<br/><br/>The book will also look at how, at times, traditions limit true change. In my book, I share the story of a family that lost business due to gender bias. This plumbing business lost revenue because instead of giving the business minded women leadership of the company, power was given to the eldest male. They were not prepared for the role. Through the use of these stories I hope to highlight the challenges men face in finding purpose in life and building sound stable relationships.<br/><br/>I conclude the book by showing how, through the creation of Tribes, we can build a support structure that helps us to address and overcome many of the negative effects of toxic masculinity. Creating a Tribe in our professional lives. What to do as leaders in the workplace, colleagues with women, and becoming agents of change. Creating a Tribe in our personal lives. How to build and maintain male friendships, community involvement, and spiritual development. And lastly, creating a Tribe in our family lives. How to parent young boys. As well as fostering a loving relationship with your wife.<br/><br/>The problems discussed early in the book begin in childhood and continue throughout life. I will show why it is important to talk to parents, spouses, young professionals. If you have felt the pain of toxic masculinity, you know that this is a fight we must take on now. The issues faced today will fester and continue to grow with time. In order to save future generations the pain and heartbreak of dealing with toxic masculinity we must be strong now. We need to have these conversations now. These are issues that are important to discuss with parents, spouses, and young professionals. If you have felt the pain of toxic masculinity then you know it is time to fight this battle in the hopes that we can spare the younger generation from experiencing that same pain.<br/><br/>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get<br/>I need your support via time, talent and/or treasure.

Ultimately, finding your purpose, planning your happiness, and building your resilience muscle.My name is Michael King Jr., and I am the author of Tribe of Men. I wrote this book to show that in order to find emotional peace, and to maintain a proper work/life balance, Men's mental health matters! I want to help men be relationship ready before they get into commitments, whether social, intimate, or business. I want to show how to heal communities by addressing issues faced by everyday men.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the importance of self care for body, mind, and spirit; to discover the value of mental health. I will show you how to make a plan to become a better king for your kingdom. This book is an opportunity for you to engage with the evolution of cultural norms, escape from patriarchal traditions, and discover a path to your purpose.You will love this book if you are ready to tackle tough issues in your life! Whether that be bouncing back from a break up or even just stressful life transitions.Tribe of Men speaks to busy millennials and generation X men who want to grapple with self development and cultural practices in a new way. Ultimately, I hope that Tribe of Men inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pushing you to engage with questions like:What tools do I need to build my resilience muscle?How do you deal with issues of insecurity?How do you create healthy relationships?Can you confront toxic masculine pride?I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing the power of vulnerability, cultural trauma, and the stigma surrounding mental health will change us all for the better.The Book - Tribe of MenThe book begins by covering how we got to the point where we are. Next, I show the situations that these issues have lead to. Finally, I close out the book by showing the strategies and mindsets needed to fix the problems we see.Throughout the book I address issues such as the cult of toxic masculinity, the science behind a growth mindset, and men’s mental health. I hope to express the importance of having conversations relating to these issues and their time sensitive nature.These issues need to be taken seriously now and not pushed off on the future generation. I hope to challenge traditional views of patriarchy. These traditions appear in our everyday lives and can be a major hinderance to true change. I hope to show that we can use our faith to help administer change and adapt to the ever changing pressures of modern life.The book will also look at how, at times, traditions limit true change. In my book, I share the story of a family that lost business due to gender bias. This plumbing business lost revenue because instead of giving the business minded women leadership of the company, power was given to the eldest male. They were not prepared for the role. Through the use of these stories I hope to highlight the challenges men face in finding purpose in life and building sound stable relationships.I conclude the book by showing how, through the creation of Tribes, we can build a support structure that helps us to address and overcome many of the negative effects of toxic masculinity. Creating a Tribe in our professional lives. What to do as leaders in the workplace, colleagues with women, and becoming agents of change. Creating a Tribe in our personal lives. How to build and maintain male friendships, community involvement, and spiritual development. And lastly, creating a Tribe in our family lives. How to parent young boys. As well as fostering a loving relationship with your wife.The problems discussed early in the book begin in childhood and continue throughout life. I will show why it is important to talk to parents, spouses, young professionals. If you have felt the pain of toxic masculinity, you know that this is a fight we must take on now.

<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>In the last few years I've raised a lot of money for projects. Whether it be the Great War Group, or child victims of domestic violence, I've hit you all up at some stage for someone else's gain. It feels very odd asking for something for me, for a change, but for the last few months I have been working my tail off with my wonderful illustrator chum Steve Smith to produce something completely new. We wanted, using my brain and his arty fingers to produce a one volume history of the First World War for young people. Not only would we teach them about the Western Front and trenches, but we'd explain why it happened, and how it was a truly global conflict with far-reaching consequences.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Why Do We Need Funding?</h3>
<p>We are utterly in love with the result, and our proof-readers are too. But it's become a monster. We envisaged 200 pages, but then things like Africa, the Caucasus Front, the Russian Revolution would have had to be cut. We would have lost the chance to fulfil our remit of talking about all victims of the war and all contributors. The book now comes in at nearly 400 pages. At all junctions Steve and I have tried to produce the war book we wish we'd owned as nerdy kids. A weird thing happened, too, in the process. It has turned out to be ideal as a primer for adult newcomers to the subject. We passionately believe in publishing the book as it is now, and not hacking it to pieces. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What Will My Funding Do?</h3>
<p>Well you'll see from the perks, that not only will you bag your own copy, but we've set this funding project up so that you can also help us get it into schools by donating copies to children. </p>
<ul><li>It is imperative that we shift the narrative of the First World War away from being solely about trenches and the Western Front. And we need to start somewhere. </li></ul>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Tiffany Green-Abdullah and I am the author of The Bean Pie: 4 Generations of Faith, Family, and Fortitude. I wrote this book as a way to connect with my past, remind me of how far I have come and where I came from. This is a guide from my past to my future. It is a legacy for my children and family. Making bean pies connected me to my past and created a curiosity that has lead me as it does today.<br/><br/>This book is a tribute to the voiceless women in my family who endured pain and sacrifice beyond comprehension so that our family can exist as it does today. My role is to write this so that we can uplift them and honor their commitment and sacrifice into a hopeful future. I want my children and future generations to know that they are not here by accident. The toil of our ancestors, including the success and mistakes make us who we are. No one is perfect, but it takes strength and fortitude to keep going and learn from one generation to the next. I am leaning on that strength myself as I write this book during one of the most challenging times the world has seen.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover an unknown story about the bean pie and my family’s history in the Nation of Islam. In this book, I hope to instill the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for you. And then ultimately I want you to see this book as a tool to help you understand the internal pain that these women endured in breaking cycles for our future.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about Faith, Forgiveness and Fortitude, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>How my mother, at age 14, helped to spread the bean pie from Chicago to all over the nation</li>
<li>How Aunt Daisy migrated from Alabama to Detroit and then to Chicago and became a mogul.</li>
<li>How faith, family and fortitude helped me overcome the death of two of my children.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you want to learn about unsung heroes behind history and how families need to share their stories.</p>

<h3>Stretch Goal</h3>
<h3> </h3>
<p>Genetically engineered beasts. Immortality through technology. Corporate dominance of politics and economics. A land where mercenaries, marauders and martial artists vie for supremacy. A land where the mean neon-drenched streets and the forest of warriors collide.</p>
<p>SAGA OF THE SWORDBREAKER is the next series in my publishing schedule.  Cultivation with a cyberpunk twist, it is a story of a young man making his way as an armed escort in a high-tech fantasy world mired in a degenerate age. </p>
<p>In a world obsessed with wealth, power and immortality, Li Ming strives for peace and harmony within and around him, delivering justice at the point of his swordbreaker.</p>
<p>But before he becomes an escort, before he even receives his signature swordbreaker, Li Ming was first a soldier. </p>
<p>A sergeant in the Special Military Police, his mission was to defend the innocent from monsters and criminals too dangerous for the regular police to handle. He served with honor and distinction, employing his martial talents to the fullest.</p>
<p>One week before the end of his term of service, Li Ming is called up for one last mission.</p>
<p>A powerful secret society has seized control of an urban slum. The Special Military Police have been ordered to pacify the area and neutralize the criminal element. It is the most dangerous mission in his career, but Li Ming is up to the task.</p>
<p>Or so he thinks.</p>
<p>DAYS OF FIRE is the explosive prologue of a new cyberpunk cultivation series.  This stretch goal will be unlocked at $1800 -- a funding level of 150%. ALL backers will receive a digital copy ONE YEAR ahead of the market. </p>
<p>Yes, you read that right. DAYS OF FIRE was originally planned to be released in 2021, after SINGULARITY SUNRISE. This book hasn't been written yet. But if we hit the stretch goal, I will prioritise writing this story, and I will deliver it to backers ONE YEAR before its official publication. </p>
<p>If you love martial arts, explosive action, and a pulpy blend of technology and magic, DAYS OF FIRE is for you! Back SINGULARITY SUNRISE and spread the word!</p>

<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Writing is my calling. I've been a pro writer since 2017, beginning with the Covenant Chronicles. In 2019, I turned to crowdfunding, and published the Dungeon Samurai trilogy and Babylon Blues. I've delivered every book on time and within budget. </p>
<p>As an independent author, I don't have to answer to politicians, editors, sensitivity readers, or anyone else who wants to dictate what creators can do. But that means I need to shoulder the costs--and keep the lights on. This campaign will cover the production cost of the series, allowing me to focus on delivering the books to you.</p>
<p>SINGULARITY SUNRISE is my most ambitious series yet. Consisting of five novels, every book will be published every sixty days beginning in July. All five books are complete. There is no risk that the project will fail. If you want a taste of what to expect from the series, sign up for my newsletter <a href=""https://dl.bookfunnel.com/e94ue1fdsn"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> and receive the exclusive FREE prequel short story!</p>
<p>If you back SINGULARITY SUNRISE, you will get the books 2 weeks ahead of everybody else, with NO obligation to leave a review. You'll also enjoy backer-exclusive rewards, including custom artwork, a chance to be part of the story, and to have a one-on-one video chat session with me.</p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">This project will only be funded if it hits its funding goals. That will significantly delay the publication of this groundbreaking series. I don't want that, and I'm sure neither do you.</span></p>

<h3>Introduction to the Author and the Project</h3>
<ul></ul>
<p>Welcome to the fundraising campaign for Origins of the Hebrews (OOTH) and The World's Oldest Alphabet (TWOA), two books written by Dr. Douglas Petrovich, Professor of Biblical History and Exegesis at The Bible Seminary in Katy, Texas. Professor Petrovich is a biblical scholar, historian, archaeologist, Egyptologist, and epigrapher who specializes in the Israelite sojourn in Egypt and the world's oldest alphabetic script, which was originated by Joseph's sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who developed this pictographic script by taking 22 signs from the hieroglyphic sign list and using them to represent the consonants in their alphabet. This invention led to our alphabet, which allows you to understand exactly what I am writing.</p>
<p>This campaign is being launched to reprint TWOA: Hebrew as the Language of the Proto-Consonantal Script, which was published in 2016 but went out of print in the first few months of 2020. At that time, the publisher (Carta, Jerusalem) was planning to reprint the book, but with the onset of COVID, their sales plummeted, because the majority of them come through foreign tourists who buy their books in Israeli and Palestinian shops. COVID obviously brought a halt to tourism, so TWOA was not able to be reprinted. Carta finally just approved the reprinting of TWOA, but they do not have the capital to pay for the printing. Hopefully, this campaign not only will lead to the printing of TWOA, but it will help to revive Carta, even if not completely.</p>
<p>TWOA features the translation and biblio-historical importance of 15 proto-consonantal Hebrew inscriptions dating from 1840-1446 BC, which falls within the 430 years during which biblical chronology requires that Jacob and his descendants resided in Egypt, before the exodus. The book also includes a section on Sinai 115 and its mostly-Middle-Egyptian caption that reads, ""6 Levantines, Hebrews of Bethel the beloved,"" which was inscribed by Joseph's son, Manasseh, under his Egyptian name, Hebeded. Sinai 115, by far, represents the oldest attested non-biblical reference to the Hebrew/Israelite people (1842 BC).</p>
<p>Professor Petrovich's second book, OOTH: New Evidence for Israelites in Egypt from Joseph to the Exodus, is being published for the first time. OOTH is a companion volume to TWOA, and it offers the results of groundbreaking research that provides evidence of Israelites in Egypt from Joseph's day until the exodus, under Moses. This evidence exists in the form of Middle Egyptian inscriptions that name Joseph, Manasseh, Ephraim, Shechem (Manasseh's son), persuasive signs of Joseph's administration as Egypt's vizier, uniquely-Israelite domestic architecture that later is found to distinguish their homes in Canaan, and proto-consonantal inscriptions that name three biblical figures, among other forms of evidence.</p>
<p>The importance of this volume cannot be overstated, because professors in universities around the world have used the lack of any evidence of Israelites in Egypt during the Bible's Egyptian sojourn to ridicule the concept of the historical reliability of the biblical text. With the publication of this book, for the first time ever, powerful evidence is presented that will refute these criticisms for any objective thinker. Students will be equipped with strong argumentation that they can use to rebut the unfair accusations of biased university professors. Jews and Christians who believe in the reality of the Egyptian sojourn and exodus will be vindicated in their conviction that the Bible presents a historical account of these events. These two books go hand in hand to provide a brand new day for the field of biblical history.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Funding Needed and the Perks to Donors</h3>
<p>In order to cover the cost of (1) reprinting TWOA, (2) printing OOTH, (3) artists' drawings, (4) an indexer's work, (5) the shipping of books to consigners, (6) INDIEGOGO fees, and (7) miscellaneous costs, a total of $32,500 needs to be raised. All of this will provide for 1000 copies of both books. This conservative printing represents the exact number of copies of TWOA that were printed early in 2017. Because these 1000 copies sold out by 2020, which reflects the quality of the product, there is no reason to believe that 1000 copies of each book will not sell out, especially considering how 3-5 people (on average) have been writing Professor Petrovich each week to ask how they might find a copy of TWOA, or when OOTH will be in print.</p>
<p>You can help fill this need by contributing any amount toward the campaign. For anyone who donates $500, you will receive a signed copy of OOTH. For anyone who donates $1,000, you will receive a signed copy of OOTH, electronic versions of every one of Professor Petrovich's proto-consonantal Hebrew inscriptions that are documented in TWOA, plus five hours of your own online conference that delves into any area of either book that the donor prefers. Plus, you will be free to invite as many family members and friends that you want to participate in the conference with you.</p>
<p>If the financial goal is not reached, the author will be required to pay a fee of about $1,500, but he will receive whatever amount is raised, nonetheless. If less than $20,000 is raised, as many copies of OOTH that can be printed will be printed. If over $20,000 is raised, then all 1,000 copies of TWOA will be printed, plus as many copies of OOTH as possible. If all $32,500 is raised, then 1,000 copies of each book will be printed. If more than $32,500 is raised, then extra copies of one or both books will be printed, with exact proportions yet to be determined.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Track Record with Crowdfunding Campaigns</h3>
<p>The author has attempted only one prior crowdfunding campaign, which was launched in 2016 to raise funds for the initial printing of TWOA. With a campaign that required $28,000 to be raised, a total of $32,400 was received. Therefore, 115% of the required funds came in, allowing for the entire printing of 1000 copies of TWOA to be produced. While Professor Petrovich is quick to note that this is not a reflection of his charm or persuasiveness, he has pointed out that it does reflect the great value in the project (which also had to be the contributors' conviction).</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks and Challenges</h3>
<p>Given that many scholars in the fields of biblical studies and ancient Near Eastern historical studies obstinately oppose the notion of an Israelite presence in Egypt during the first half of the second millennium BC, one risk is that one of the publishers may be pressured to pull the book from scholarly publication. Welcome to the world of ""objective scholarship."" Fortunately, both publishers have assured the author that they are committed to printing the book, with one writing this before the initial printing of TWOA, ""I for one can hardly wait to watch the sparks of debate flying, or better still, the pollination of fruitful thought when your book sees the light of day."" </p>
<p>After the book was in print, two ancient Near Eastern scholars indeed attempted to coerce the publisher into pulling the book, which failed. However, they pressured the publisher's North American distributor into (1) not advertising TWOA, and (2) not selling copies of TWOA at shows where they bring copies of their authors' books to sell. Despite these deranged attempts to stop the book from being sold, TWOA sold out every copy that was printed. Books of this nature will be scrutinized as few others in history have been, and thus the care and accuracy with which the project was completed is incalculable. The author spared no expense in attempting to achieve accuracy, which required nine years of work before the project came to complete fruition.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways To Help with the Project</h3>
<p>Some people cannot afford to contribute to the project, but there are other ways to help.  Most importantly, you can send the link for the campaign to as many people in your address book as appropriate. This will spread the word and allow for many more people to know about and contribute to the campaign, who never would have known about it, otherwise. Another way to help is simply--but powerfully--to pray that the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob would look down on this project with favor and supply all of the needed funds. After all, Psalm 50:10 says that he owns the cattle on a thousand hills. Given that these two books essentially make his name great on the earth, it would seem that this is a prayer he would love to answer.</p>

Given that many scholars in the fields of biblical studies and ancient Near Eastern historical studies obstinately oppose the notion of an Israelite presence in Egypt during the first half of the second millennium BC, one risk is that one of the publishers may be pressured to pull the book from scholarly publication. Welcome to the world of ""objective scholarship."" Fortunately, both publishers have assured the author that they are committed to printing the book, with one writing this before the initial printing of TWOA, ""I for one can hardly wait to watch the sparks of debate flying, or better still, the pollination of fruitful thought when your book sees the light of day."" 
After the book was in print, two ancient Near Eastern scholars indeed attempted to coerce the publisher into pulling the book, which failed. However, they pressured the publisher's North American distributor into (1) not advertising TWOA, and (2) not selling copies of TWOA at shows where they bring copies of their authors' books to sell. Despite these deranged attempts to stop the book from being sold, TWOA sold out every copy that was printed. Books of this nature will be scrutinized as few others in history have been, and thus the care and accuracy with which the project was completed is incalculable. The author spared no expense in attempting to achieve accuracy, which required nine years of work before the project came to complete fruition.

Other Ways To Help with the Project
Some people cannot afford to contribute to the project, but there are other ways to help.  Most importantly, you can send the link for the campaign to as many people in your address book as appropriate. This will spread the word and allow for many more people to know about and contribute to the campaign, who never would have known about it, otherwise. Another way to help is simply--but powerfully--to pray that the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob would look down on this project with favor and supply all of the needed funds. After all, Psalm 50:10 says that he owns the cattle on a thousand hills. Given that these two books essentially make his name great on the earth, it would seem that this is a prayer he would love to answer.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

Even during the pandemic, this small, volunteer only organization has continued to help and support survivors and their families.

<h3>HOW DID I GET HERE?!</h3>
<p>Never in my worst nightmare did I think I would be diagnosed with breast cancer 1 year after earning my PhD! I wrote this book because if my faith and recognizing God’s humor can heal me, it can heal anyone.</p>

<p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that faith and prayer don’t go with fear and worry.

<p>You will love this book if you have experienced hardship, illness, or dark moments in your life. You will laugh at my pain, just as I did.

<p><i>God’s Got Jokes</i> speaks to those affected by breast cancer, including young women and families, whose lives have been put on hold and faith tested, while dealing with some of the most difficult decisions a person can make.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<i>Skills: The Common Denominator</i> is a book that illustrates the importance of transferable skills and how to use them in a modern day job search. Most people imagine their career following a straight path, but my experience has been more of a windy road that took me through the public, private and non-profit sectors in the first five years of my career. This non-traditional path has enabled me to recognize those transferable skills and how to talk about them with future employers. <br/><br/>My name is Asha Aravindakshan and I am the author of <i>Skills: The Common Denominator</i>. I wrote this book to share my unique perspective of being both a job seeker and a hiring manager across various sectors, allowing me to breakdown the job search challenge using my first-hand experiences.<br/><br/>In reading this book, I hope to instill in you the same level of passion and excitement that I have found in my career. You will discover insights to help identify your transferable skills, cultivate your networks and conquer the job search to find a role that best suits your strengths. These learnings will help to shape your professional brand, leverage digital tools and tackle business networking in your job search.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll hear stories from:<ul>
<li>A non-profit fundraiser turned community development executive,</li>
<li>A civil engineer turned  venture capitalist,</li>

<h2><strong>The Story of Ballad of Dreams</strong></h2>
<p>Audrey, A vibrant, sixty-five-year-old grandmother and mother of thirteen, is confronted with the dreams of her youth, to perform at Carnegie Hall, when her granddaughter Amelia starts following in her footsteps. Will her memories inform her choices as she searches for pianos and her independence?<br/><br/>Audrey and Rose are cousins and best friends whose trajectories, choices, sacrifices, and life experiences are drastically different, but the constant throughout their life is their friendship. What greater love story is there than the one between two friends? They both go through a journey of discovering their own identity and independence as women in a time where society tried to define that for them.<br/><br/>Inspired by a true story and told non-linearly,<i> Ballad of Dreams</i> is a story about friendship, dreams, love, loss...and everything in between. It combines the richness and drama of musical theater with historical fiction.<br/><br/>My name is Allyson Hernandez, and I am the author of<i> Ballad of Dreams</i>. I wrote this book because, well, I had to write it. I was inspired after my grandmother passed away after 96 years of life and 2 days before my 40th birthday. Something happened when I turned 40. I started to question everything in my life—my values, goals, accomplishments, choices, hopes, and dreams and the sacrifices I had made as a mother. There was something about turning 40 and my Grandma passing that lit a huge creative fire in me. Call it a mid-life, creative crisis. I wanted to understand if my grandmother, who had 13 children, had gone through the same thing? Were the choices she made in the 1940s all that different than my own?<br/><br/>My hope for this book is to inspire people of every age, especially women and mothers, to recognize that we are not just one thing, and we don’t have to blend in. That it’s never too late to chase after a new dream or accomplish one you never thought you would.</p>
<h3><strong>In this book:</strong></h3>
<p>You will meet Audrey McKenna and Rose Kelly, two Irish American cousins and best friends who live and love life in New York City in 1941.  Audrey—the fiery, bold, and determined musician—dreams of performing at Carnegie Hall, while Rose—the older, graceful, and elegant voice of reason—serves as hostess to her husband Oscar’s glamorous New York Theater social life. Bobby, Audrey’s older, wiser, and aspiring politician brother, Vic, the larger-than-life Italian-American musician, and Ted, the loyal underdog, are three best friends who round out the cast of characters. Each one plays a leading role in Audrey’s life.<br/><br/>In the run-up to the war, Audrey and her boyfriend prepare to audition as a duo act at Carnegie Hall, but things come to a grinding halt when a terrible loss surfaces out of nowhere. At the same time, Rose suffers losses of her own as her perfect marriage crumbles around her.<br/><br/>Now in their late sixties, Audrey, a grandmother, and Rose, a childless great-aunt, are confronted with the dreams and memories of their youth. Will their memories inform their choices as they search for pianos and their independence, or will they create new dreams to achieve?<br/><br/>Audrey’s adventures take her to key places like the Jersey Shore, New York City, Dublin, Australia, Nashville, Alaska, and back again. But at the center of her adventure is music and her piano. Music is the very heartbeat of this story.<br/><br/><i>Ballad of Dreams </i>sings of the power of friendship and demonstrates the shift in how women saw themselves, and their identities, through different eras of society spanning from the 1930s to the early 2000s. While inspired by true events and influenced by key moments in history, the story and characters are fictionalized.<br/><br/><i>Ballad of Dreams</i> follows multiple paths. It embraces the notion that “It’s Never Too Late” to start a new dream or achieve one you never thought you would. It helps readers see how many components can influence and shape our identity, while uniquely combining lyrics with novel writing.</p>
<p>If you love books like City of Girls, and Firefly Lane, TV shows like The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, and Musicals like Waitress and Beautiful, then this is the book for you!<br/><br/>This book is for dream chasers. It’s for women, mothers, grandmothers, and women in the arts. It’s for fathers, grandfathers, brothers, and sisters, or whoever you call family. It’s for theater people who love musicals, career-driven performers, musicians, artists, and anyone dealing with their own self-identity or coping with loss. Out of all the people I just listed, none of them are just one thing. That is exactly why this book is so important.  We all need to hear that we aren't limited to one path in life.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Ballad of Dreams </i>inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<p>1) What does blending in mean?</p>
<p>2) What are the different paths and parts that shape our identity?</p>
<p>3) How has society impacted women’s choices?</p>
<p>4) Can our dreams change? Can we choose new ones? How does age impact our choices, dreams, and independence?</p>
<p>5) Can we have it all? Will we always wonder/wish to be in someone else’s shoes?</p>
<p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers!</p>

</div></div>","The Story of Ballad of Dreams
Audrey, A vibrant, sixty-five-year-old grandmother and mother of thirteen, is confronted with the dreams of her youth, to perform at Carnegie Hall, when her granddaughter Amelia starts following in her footsteps. Will her memories inform her choices as she searches for pianos and her independence?Audrey and Rose are cousins and best friends whose trajectories, choices, sacrifices, and life experiences are drastically different, but the constant throughout their life is their friendship. What greater love story is there than the one between two friends? They both go through a journey of discovering their own identity and independence as women in a time where society tried to define that for them.Inspired by a true story and told non-linearly, Ballad of Dreams is a story about friendship, dreams, love, loss...and everything in between. It combines the richness and drama of musical theater with historical fiction.My name is Allyson Hernandez, and I am the author of Ballad of Dreams. I wrote this book because, well, I had to write it. I was inspired after my grandmother passed away after 96 years of life and 2 days before my 40th birthday. Something happened when I turned 40. I started to question everything in my life—my values, goals, accomplishments, choices, hopes, and dreams and the sacrifices I had made as a mother. There was something about turning 40 and my Grandma passing that lit a huge creative fire in me. Call it a mid-life, creative crisis. I wanted to understand if my grandmother, who had 13 children, had gone through the same thing? Were the choices she made in the 1940s all that different than my own?My hope for this book is to inspire people of every age, especially women and mothers, to recognize that we are not just one thing, and we don’t have to blend in. That it’s never too late to chase after a new dream or accomplish one you never thought you would.
In this book:
You will meet Audrey McKenna and Rose Kelly, two Irish American cousins and best friends who live and love life in New York City in 1941.  Audrey—the fiery, bold, and determined musician—dreams of performing at Carnegie Hall, while Rose—the older, graceful, and elegant voice of reason—serves as hostess to her husband Oscar’s glamorous New York Theater social life. Bobby, Audrey’s older, wiser, and aspiring politician brother, Vic, the larger-than-life Italian-American musician, and Ted, the loyal underdog, are three best friends who round out the cast of characters. Each one plays a leading role in Audrey’s life.In the run-up to the war, Audrey and her boyfriend prepare to audition as a duo act at Carnegie Hall, but things come to a grinding halt when a terrible loss surfaces out of nowhere. At the same time, Rose suffers losses of her own as her perfect marriage crumbles around her.Now in their late sixties, Audrey, a grandmother, and Rose, a childless great-aunt, are confronted with the dreams and memories of their youth. Will their memories inform their choices as they search for pianos and their independence, or will they create new dreams to achieve?Audrey’s adventures take her to key places like the Jersey Shore, New York City, Dublin, Australia, Nashville, Alaska, and back again. But at the center of her adventure is music and her piano. Music is the very heartbeat of this story.Ballad of Dreams sings of the power of friendship and demonstrates the shift in how women saw themselves, and their identities, through different eras of society spanning from the 1930s to the early 2000s. While inspired by true events and influenced by key moments in history, the story and characters are fictionalized.Ballad of Dreams follows multiple paths. It embraces the notion that “It’s Never Too Late” to start a new dream or achieve one you never thought you would. It helps readers see how many components can influence and shape our identity, while uniquely combining lyrics with novel writing.
If you love books like City of Girls, and Firefly Lane, TV shows like The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, and Musicals like Waitress and Beautiful, then this is the book for you!This book is for dream chasers. It’s for women, mothers, grandmothers, and women in the arts. It’s for fathers, grandfathers, brothers, and sisters, or whoever you call family. It’s for theater people who love musicals, career-driven performers, musicians, artists, and anyone dealing with their own self-identity or coping with loss. Out of all the people I just listed, none of them are just one thing. That is exactly why this book is so important.  We all need to hear that we aren't limited to one path in life.
Ultimately, I hope that Ballad of Dreams inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:
1) What does blending in mean?
2) What are the different paths and parts that shape our identity?
3) How has society impacted women’s choices?
4) Can our dreams change? Can we choose new ones? How does age impact our choices, dreams, and independence?
5) Can we have it all? Will we always wonder/wish to be in someone else’s shoes?
I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers!

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The Startup Leap gives you the roadmap for your successful startup while training you to avoid potholes. This book shares everything that you need to know before you take the startup leap, by giving you insights and learnings from unique real-founder experiences, teaching you how to find structure in the chaotic initial phases, and ensuring that you avoid common mistakes that first-time founders make.<br/><br/>My name is Uttara and I am the author of The Startup Leap. I wrote this book because I wanted to create a framework for the startup building process. No two startups are ever built the same way, but most of them go through similar journeys. I wanted to pen down these journeys in phases to give you an insight into what makes a company successful in each phase. I wrote this book as a short, go-to guide for myself to pick up when I build my own tech startup. If you find yourself in the shoes of an aspiring startup founder, you can use this book as your shortcut to success too! <br/><br/>In this book, you'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>The story of Aditya Sharma, who co-founded a wildly successful online merchandising store in India called The Souled Store.</li>
<li>The story of Victoria Livschitz, who used her innovative, technical mind to build and grow Grid Dynamics, an IT services company, which eventually lead to an IPO.</li>
<li>The story of Joon Beh, whose startup product, Hallo, was simply a function of a personal problem that he could closely relate to and wanted to solve.  </li>
</ul>
<p><br/>The Startup Leap is a nonfiction book that speaks to aspiring startup founders. My aim for this book is simple - To bring great value to my readers by being crisp and to the point in every chapter, while accessorizing liberally with real-world anecdotes of the failures and successes experienced by real founders from various backgrounds/industries to make the book engaging. This short ~150-page book is all you need to get started, so get your hands on it already!</p>
</div><div>
<h2> </h2>
<h2>The Book - The Startup Leap</h2>
<p>The book is written in 4 parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction and chapters on what you, as an aspiring founder, need to know about before you even get started on your startup journey. Think of this phase as getting into the nitty-gritty before you get your hands dirty. In this phase, you will learn how to come up with the perfect startup idea, get into the right mindset to set yourself up for success, create a flawless business plan, and find a strong partnership with co-founders.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains the chapters that guide you on how to begin setting up your startup to be able to find Product-Market Fit. You will learn how to go lean on your proof of concept, how to engage with potential customers, which metrics to track for traction, and how to find the right set of advisors as you gradually build iterative versions of your product.<br/><br/>Part 3 will teach you how to keep your startup afloat once you find some traction. You will learn about the various ways to delight your customers with your product, learn how to market your product, build a motivated and driven team, and find and follow the patterns that work for you, which will eventually lead you to Product-Market Fit.<br/><br/>And finally, Part 4 is a bonus! In this part, I’ve broken the pattern to give you some of the most insightful learnings from the failures that founders I interviewed experienced during their startup journeys, straight from the horses’ mouths! This part is short but as valuable to learn as the others.</p>

You will learn about the various ways to delight your customers with your product, learn how to market your product, build a motivated and driven team, and find and follow the patterns that work for you, which will eventually lead you to Product-Market Fit.And finally, Part 4 is a bonus! In this part, I’ve broken the pattern to give you some of the most insightful learnings from the failures that founders I interviewed experienced during their startup journeys, straight from the horses’ mouths! This part is short but as valuable to learn as the others.

International Preorders
For international preorders, please do the following:

Identify the perk that interests you, e.g. 1 or 2 paperbacks
Select the pink ""Back it"" button to ""Make a contribution"" for the same amount (this choice bypasses the shipping address page)
Use my email uttara.shekar@gmail.com to share your mailing address, so I can calculate the international shipping costs and invoice you for that amount via PayPal/Venmo.

 

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies are expected to ship.

At the top of the campaign page, you will see the ""share"" buttons. Click on the ""chain"" icon to get a custom link just for you. (Note: don't use the URL in the browser window as it won't work to track referrals and you won't get credit ?)

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>My name is Michael Chidester. I started HEMA in 2001, and for the past ten years, I've been leading a project called <a href=""https://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Main_Page"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Wiktenauer</a>. Wiktenauer grew out of a desire to set the text of our fencing manuals free from the page and put it into the hands of fencers. What I'd like to do with this project is slightly different: put the page, and the whole book, into your hands as well. We're going to produce a full facsimile of one of the most important 15th century fencing treatises, the <a href=""https://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Fior_di_Battaglia_(MS_Ludwig_XV_13)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">copy of <i>Fior di Battaglia</i></a> held by the J. Paul Getty Museum in sunny Malibu, California (ms. Ludwig XV 13).</p>
<p>Facsimile is a word that's thrown around a lot, and means different things to different people. What I mean when I use it is a careful reproduction of the entire physical book in detail. Such facsimiles are often produced of famous manuscripts and early printed books for collectors, and they are also exhibited by museums and libraries in cases where the original can't or shouldn't be displayed.</p>
<p>In other words, it's a book you can pick up and touch without endangering something priceless, but which will at least half-convince you that you're holding the original.</p>
<p>At various times, I have had the privilege of handling several 15th and 16th century fencing manuscripts, as well as copies of most of the printed fencing manuals published before 1600, and I wish everyone in HEMA could have that same chance. It's a way of connecting to history that's hard to describe. A good facsimile can capture at least a small piece of that magic, and give you a sense of what the origin of our fencing reconstruction really is.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596678739/r1bmnv4mrntpbqienxgz.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><i>Comparing the New Haven Gladiatoria manuscript (top) to the Orbis Pictus facsimile of the Kraków Gladiatoria (bottom).</i></p>
<p>There are many treatises worthy of this sort of project, but in the past only two have received it: the <a href=""https://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Gladiatoria_(MS_Germ.Quart.16)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gladiatoria manuscript</a> held by the Biblioteka Jagiellońska in Kraków, Poland, and <a href=""https://wiktenauer.com/wiki/Walpurgis_Fechtbuch_(MS_I.33)"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Walpurgis Fechtbuch</a>, held by the Royal Armouries in Leeds, UK. Last fall, we set about producing a third one:  Hans Talhoffer's <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/manuscript-facsimile-project/x/1789830"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">manuscript Thott 290 2º</a>, held by Det Kongelige Bibliotek in København, Denmark.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1596679522/vm3lmanztismujvbrt24.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><i>The 2020 Talhoffer facsimile.</i></p>
<p>This effort succeeded beautifully, and reviews of the Talhoffer facsimile have been glowing. (You can read some of them below.) I said at the time that if it succeeded, it would be the first of many. The second of many, then, will be Fiore.</p>
<p><i>Fior di Battaglia</i> is a beautiful illuminated manuscript created in Venice or Padua in the first decade of the 15th century. It is written on vellum in a Friulian dialect of Italian, using a humanistic hand. Its position as the oldest surviving Italian fencing treatise (or a copy thereof), as well as the oldest illustrated treatise covering each of its weapons, makes it one of the most important historical fencing manuals in existence.</p>

</div></div>","Summary
My name is Michael Chidester. I started HEMA in 2001, and for the past ten years, I've been leading a project called Wiktenauer. Wiktenauer grew out of a desire to set the text of our fencing manuals free from the page and put it into the hands of fencers. What I'd like to do with this project is slightly different: put the page, and the whole book, into your hands as well. We're going to produce a full facsimile of one of the most important 15th century fencing treatises, the copy of Fior di Battaglia held by the J. Paul Getty Museum in sunny Malibu, California (ms. Ludwig XV 13).
Facsimile is a word that's thrown around a lot, and means different things to different people. What I mean when I use it is a careful reproduction of the entire physical book in detail. Such facsimiles are often produced of famous manuscripts and early printed books for collectors, and they are also exhibited by museums and libraries in cases where the original can't or shouldn't be displayed.
In other words, it's a book you can pick up and touch without endangering something priceless, but which will at least half-convince you that you're holding the original.
At various times, I have had the privilege of handling several 15th and 16th century fencing manuscripts, as well as copies of most of the printed fencing manuals published before 1600, and I wish everyone in HEMA could have that same chance. It's a way of connecting to history that's hard to describe. A good facsimile can capture at least a small piece of that magic, and give you a sense of what the origin of our fencing reconstruction really is.
Comparing the New Haven Gladiatoria manuscript (top) to the Orbis Pictus facsimile of the Kraków Gladiatoria (bottom).
There are many treatises worthy of this sort of project, but in the past only two have received it: the Gladiatoria manuscript held by the Biblioteka Jagiellońska in Kraków, Poland, and Walpurgis Fechtbuch, held by the Royal Armouries in Leeds, UK. Last fall, we set about producing a third one:  Hans Talhoffer's manuscript Thott 290 2º, held by Det Kongelige Bibliotek in København, Denmark.
The 2020 Talhoffer facsimile.
This effort succeeded beautifully, and reviews of the Talhoffer facsimile have been glowing. (You can read some of them below.) I said at the time that if it succeeded, it would be the first of many. The second of many, then, will be Fiore.
Fior di Battaglia is a beautiful illuminated manuscript created in Venice or Padua in the first decade of the 15th century. It is written on vellum in a Friulian dialect of Italian, using a humanistic hand. Its position as the oldest surviving Italian fencing treatise (or a copy thereof), as well as the oldest illustrated treatise covering each of its weapons, makes it one of the most important historical fencing manuals in existence.

It is particularly prized by students of its author, Fiore dei Liberi, because by many metrics it is the most comprehensive copy of his teachings, containing the most text if not the most illustrations. (I personally prefer the Morgan Library and Museum's copy, but at less than half the length of the Getty's, and lacking several weapons, it wouldn't make a very impressive facsimile.) 

What We Need & What You Get
Facsimiles like this are usually quite expensive. For example, the Orbis Pictus Gladiatoria cost about $900, while the Extraordinary Editions I.33 was released in two different editions, costing around $1,000 and $2,000. Facsimiles for more famous or lavish manuscripts can run into the five figure range.
One of my objectives in the Talhoffer project was to see how inexpensively such a book can be produced. I selected Grimm Book Bindery in Madison, Wisconsin, to do the printing and binding, and spent quite a bit of time discussing the project with them and ironing out every detail to be as precise as possible.
The cover of the Talhoffer facsimile, including the original blind-tooled design and the title applied by a later owner.
This time around, we've worked out the basic process, so I'm going to try for even more minute accuracy:

The book will be approximately the same size as the original (to within about a centimeter).
Most of the Getty's scans are offered for free online with an open license, but I've also purchased and licensed scans of the two text-only pages and thirteen blank pages (which aren't online), so we can get an accurate look at the manuscript from cover to cover.
We can't use real vellum, and even if we could, the skin's pattern would clash with the pattern that's already on the Getty scans. So instead, I bought a sheet of goatskin parchment and sent it to the binder so they could figure out a paper that matches the weight and feel of it as closely as possible.
We're going to replicate the actual quire structure of the manuscript, so all the pages will be center-sewn and bound in the exact same way as the original, tipped-in pages and all.
We'll be using the same 7-8 mm boards as in the Talhoffer facsimile (which are about 3 times thicker than today's book covers).
The covers will be made of goatskin leather, with the blind-tooling (imprinted design) on the current cover replicated, as before.

I haven't decided on what the cover will look like, but I have two candidates. One is the actual current cover, which only dates back to the 18th or 19th century (possibly ordered by Thomas Phillips). The other is a typical Biblioteca Estense binding, such as the manuscript might have been given if/when it entered Niccolo d'Este's library in the first place; this one's problematic because nearly all of these bindings date to the 18th century, and I haven't been able to determine whether this style is based on an older design that might have been around in the 15th. The brown cover is what the manuscript currently has, whereas the red cover is what it might have had in the 1400s (but I can't be sure).
To create this book, we need a minimum of 100 orders, so I have set the funding goal accordingly. The Talhoffer facsimile was sold for $150, and with unexpected costs and overruns (and a few unplanned last-minute improvements) it very nearly ended up in the red. This time, I've regrettably raised the price a bit to ensure that this won't happen again. I hope this remains affordable at $175.
The cost of these books depends on volume, so it will be a one-and-done print run, and people who don't order now will not have a chance again (unless we can scrape together another 100 orders). If we can get up to 250 orders, then some additional enhancements might become feasible (more on that as we go).
The five masters of fighting with the dagger.
I hope this book will be heirloom quality, but also durable enough to actually study out of. I would love to hear of someone actually teaching out of it in class.

There have been multiple high-quality books written about the Getty in the past few years, and I have little to add to the excellent scholarship out there.

<p><strong>Story of My Book</strong></p>
<p><i>Where Will We Go?</i> is a self-discovery story about a woman’s journey after a devastating divorce. She struggles with self-doubt, heartache, and nightmares that ultimately make her stronger through her road to pure happiness.</p>
<p>My name is Emily Craig, and I am the author of <i>Where Will We Go?</i> I wrote this book because I wanted to continue my writing journey with a sequel to my debut book, <i>Will You Love Me Again?</i>. I have loved writing since I was 10, and now I am on the steps of publishing my second book. Writing has been my escape from the world for over 15 years, and in recent months, I don’t know what I would have done without it.<br/><br/>In reading this book, my hope is that you discover that happiness comes from within yourself. No one else can create your happiness but you, and no one else can destroy it but you. I want this book to be a vessel of hope for you just like it has been for me. Lucy Berry is my saving grace, I hope she can be yours, as well.<br/> </p>
<p>In this New Adult Fiction, Lucy Berry is coming off a nasty divorce from her high school sweetheart. For the last ten years, all she’s known is him, and that he was her true love. But when he betrays their marriage and her by drinking and sleeping with another woman, she makes the toughest decision ever. With the support of her best friends, Jenny, Michael, and Aaron, she divorces her cheater of a husband, David, and starts her journey to self-discovery and happiness. In the blink of an eye, David’s mistress is sporting an engagement ring all over Facebook. Feeling unworthy of happiness isn’t going to cut it anymore, she deserves to be happy too. She finally lands her first writer position with <i>Getaway Travel Magazine</i>, and a week following her ex-husband’s engagement announcement, she jets off to Paris, France with Jenny and Michael to explore and write about four of the top France attractions.</p>
<p>You will love this book if you love self-discovery stories that make you root for the character’s success, exploring a new country, and investing in deep friendships and new experiences.<br/><br/><i>Where Will We Go?</i> speaks to young and old adults everywhere who want to experience hope and light in the very early stages of a 20-something finding herself. 20-somethings are constantly finding who they are, but are they doing it in Paris? You’ll love this book if you crave adventure, foreign countries, and famous France places.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Where Will We Go?</i> inspires reflection on how everyone handles heartbreak and that we start to see that heartbreak can be our beginning rather than our final chapter.<br/><br/>I look forward to having open conversations about heartbreak, self-discovery, and happiness with my readers!<br/> </p>

You will love this book if you love self-discovery stories that make you root for the character’s success, exploring a new country, and investing in deep friendships and new experiences.Where Will We Go? speaks to young and old adults everywhere who want to experience hope and light in the very early stages of a 20-something finding herself. 20-somethings are constantly finding who they are, but are they doing it in Paris? You’ll love this book if you crave adventure, foreign countries, and famous France places.Ultimately, I hope that Where Will We Go? inspires reflection on how everyone handles heartbreak and that we start to see that heartbreak can be our beginning rather than our final chapter.I look forward to having open conversations about heartbreak, self-discovery, and happiness with my readers!

<p><strong><i>Money Boss Mom</i> is a book about getting the right systems in place to help young parents gain control of their financial lives.</strong><br/><br/>My name is Jamie Bosse, and I am the author of <i>Money Boss Mom, Helping Young Parents Be the “Boss” of Their Financial Future</i>. I was inspired to write this book because parenthood is no joke. It takes adulting to a whole other level. As a parent, there are so many new things to worry about, and financial stressors are always a part of that equation. I want young parents to be set up for a bright future, and to be prepared for emergencies and potential risks that may come their way so that they can stop worrying and start enjoying life now.<br/><br/>My hope is that this book educates and empowers readers so that they can have the peace of mind that their financial lives are on track. When you are experiencing issues with cash flow, debt, or any other financial insecurity, that is all you can think about. It will consume you. You are in fight or flight mode and can’t focus on the things and people you love most. You can’t really enjoy life if you’re just trying to make things work until the next paycheck.</p>
<p><strong>What You'll Learn</strong><br/>In this book, you'll learn ways to manage cash flow so that you actually spend less time budgeting each month and learn what you really need to know about confusing topics like life insurance and estate planning. You'll hear stories such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>How our childhood memories shape how we think of money as adults and influence our behavior without us even knowing it.</li>
<li>Cautionary tales using fictional characters like Zack Morris, Kelly Kapowski, Romeo and Juliet to shed light on boring (but important) risk management topics.</li>
<li>How to balance the competing priorities of managing your career and saving for long term goals like retirement and college funding while managing the expenses of today.</li>
</ul>
<br/><strong>You will love this book if you are:</strong><ul>
<li>A new parent or soon-to-be parent that wants some help navigating this exciting, special, and terrifying stage of life.</li>
<li>Parents in your 20’s, 30’s, or 40’s who want to be proactive, not reactive with your money and your time.</li>
<li>Wanting to organize your financial life and break out of the paycheck to paycheck lifestyle.</li>

<h2><strong>Story of My Book </strong></h2>
<p><i>Transforming Trauma: How You Can Turn Your Pain Into Power</i> is about my personal journey. It will include stories from everyday people that are relatable to the world that we live in today. My prayer is that you are able to see that there is HOPE after a traumatic experience. Readers will appreciate learning from another person’s perspective to start changing the things on the inside to get the desired results on the outside.<br/><br/>Do you think it’s possible to get unstuck after going through traumatic events? In this book, I will give candid details about my experience with trauma and also share stories of other individuals and how they were able to move forward in life. The stories of April, Kim, Zoia, and Rosie will prove that you can move from stuck to unstuck and achieve your purpose in life by changing your perspective. At the end of the day, we are responsible for our own happiness.<br/><br/>My name is Melissa Carr and I am the author of <i>Transforming Trauma</i>: <i>How You Can Turn Your Pain Into Power</i>. I wrote this book because my own healing journey was nothing short of a miracle and God told me to share it with men and women because I wasn’t the only one that could benefit from this journey. I thought about what the entire world was going through in 2020 and thought this was a perfect time to be obedient and share.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that challenges are meant to strengthen you. It is ok to be vulnerable so that other humans can see what’s really going on inside of you as an individual. Your actions could potentially resonate with them in an effort to help them identify their strengths and move beyond what happened to them. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for mindfulness and thought leadership. It is important for your overall well-being to recover from trauma. You can start by taking mental health breaks from the traumatic situation. In my book, I will share techniques by demonstrating a unplug, recharge and reset process. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you move forward from hardship with a refreshed mindset.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about positive outcomes that can come out of tragedies like job loss, health battles, and the deaths of loved ones</p>
</div><div>
<p>Today, Kim is a very successful business woman. Kim will share the horror of losing two of very dear family members one year apart, both unexpectedly. As you can imagine, this rocked her world; however, Kim managed to move forward after the trauma.</p>
<p>Zoia grew up battling child hood trauma, she will share that she wasn’t happy with what she went through as a child and would never want anyone else to experience the trauma. However, she acknowledges that she is great for the way it set her up in life to be able to conquer anything that comes her way. As a result, Zoia created a non-profit organization, titled “Kozakov Foundation” in honor of her late father.</p>
<p>April a breast cancer survivor, had to deal with depression due to her Breast Cancer diagnosis and all of the traumatic life changes that came with it. One day April realized that she was going to fight back so she organized a successful event through the Breast Cancer Foundation titled “Rock Your Hat &amp; Scarf”.</p>
<p>You will love this book if you’re looking to read stories about real people with real stories and resources to help you move beyond challenging times.<br/><br/><i>Transforming Trauma</i>: <i>How You Can Turn Your Pain Into Power</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to men and women who want to look at challenges and self-help in a new way.<br/> </p>
<h2><strong>About The Book </strong></h2>
<p>The book is written in two parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + Chapter 1- 4. My reader will learn that in life we all will experience trauma at some point whether it be job loss, health issues, divorce, or death and while we never get over the experience, we can learn how to move forward.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains chapters 5-12. This book includes stories from various individuals that have gone through traumatic experiences. From a Breast Cancer Survivor to a successful business owner, my hope is that my readers will see themselves in these stories and know that they can overcome trauma.<br/><br/>There are people in the world just like you and I that go through traumatic experiences and they’ve learned how to deal with them and move forward leading successful lives. Due to their resilience and determination to succeed in life, these individuals created campaigns to support others that were going through health issues and even created nonprofit organization to push through the adversity.<br/><br/>Although I know that everything isn’t one-size-fits-all; my hope is that the reader will utilize the tools from my toolkit. My strategy in writing this book was to identify real people that experienced an array of trauma that would resonate with my readers. After reading through the successful stories in the previous chapters, my hope is that you’ll be able to apply the techniques, but you they will require you to trust the process.<br/> </p>

At the end of the day, we are responsible for our own happiness.My name is Melissa Carr and I am the author of Transforming Trauma: How You Can Turn Your Pain Into Power. I wrote this book because my own healing journey was nothing short of a miracle and God told me to share it with men and women because I wasn’t the only one that could benefit from this journey. I thought about what the entire world was going through in 2020 and thought this was a perfect time to be obedient and share.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that challenges are meant to strengthen you. It is ok to be vulnerable so that other humans can see what’s really going on inside of you as an individual. Your actions could potentially resonate with them in an effort to help them identify their strengths and move beyond what happened to them. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for mindfulness and thought leadership. It is important for your overall well-being to recover from trauma. You can start by taking mental health breaks from the traumatic situation. In my book, I will share techniques by demonstrating a unplug, recharge and reset process. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you move forward from hardship with a refreshed mindset.In this book, you'll learn about positive outcomes that can come out of tragedies like job loss, health battles, and the deaths of loved ones

Today, Kim is a very successful business woman. Kim will share the horror of losing two of very dear family members one year apart, both unexpectedly. As you can imagine, this rocked her world; however, Kim managed to move forward after the trauma.
Zoia grew up battling child hood trauma, she will share that she wasn’t happy with what she went through as a child and would never want anyone else to experience the trauma. However, she acknowledges that she is great for the way it set her up in life to be able to conquer anything that comes her way. As a result, Zoia created a non-profit organization, titled “Kozakov Foundation” in honor of her late father.
April a breast cancer survivor, had to deal with depression due to her Breast Cancer diagnosis and all of the traumatic life changes that came with it. One day April realized that she was going to fight back so she organized a successful event through the Breast Cancer Foundation titled “Rock Your Hat & Scarf”.
You will love this book if you’re looking to read stories about real people with real stories and resources to help you move beyond challenging times.Transforming Trauma: How You Can Turn Your Pain Into Power is a nonfiction book that speaks to men and women who want to look at challenges and self-help in a new way. 
About The Book 
The book is written in two parts.Part 1 contains the introduction + Chapter 1- 4. My reader will learn that in life we all will experience trauma at some point whether it be job loss, health issues, divorce, or death and while we never get over the experience, we can learn how to move forward.Part 2 contains chapters 5-12. This book includes stories from various individuals that have gone through traumatic experiences. From a Breast Cancer Survivor to a successful business owner, my hope is that my readers will see themselves in these stories and know that they can overcome trauma.There are people in the world just like you and I that go through traumatic experiences and they’ve learned how to deal with them and move forward leading successful lives. Due to their resilience and determination to succeed in life, these individuals created campaigns to support others that were going through health issues and even created nonprofit organization to push through the adversity.Although I know that everything isn’t one-size-fits-all; my hope is that the reader will utilize the tools from my toolkit. My strategy in writing this book was to identify real people that experienced an array of trauma that would resonate with my readers. After reading through the successful stories in the previous chapters, my hope is that you’ll be able to apply the techniques, but you they will require you to trust the process.

<h2>The Story of The Lost Winds</h2>
<p><i>Amaryllis “Amy” Sinclair has just one goal in life, and that’s to get out of high school ASAP...At least until her older sister mysteriously vanishes on the last day of school.</i></p>
<p>Sixteen-year-old Amaryllis “Amy” Sinclair is used to existing on the fringes of any given room, accustomed to hiding in the crevices where she cannot be seen. When her older sister is suddenly kidnapped by a coven of witches (yes, you read that right), Amy must break out of her shell in order to find her. Teaming up with her math-loving best friend and an unexpected classmate, Amy embarks on a bewitching journey and uncovers buried truths that threaten to permanently shift her world as she knows it. Who has been lost, and who will be found?<br/><br/>My name is Maya Simon and I am the author of The Lost Winds. I wrote this book because I have always reveled in the magic of creativity, in its ability to plant a seed of joy in an increasingly changing world. As a proud bookworm and certified binge-reader, it is an absolute dream come true to be able to publish a book of my own.</p>
<p>It is my hope that, in reading this book, you will embark on an adventure unlike any you have ever been on before. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with themes of mental health, family, and friendship, escape from the boredom of a year spent in quarantine, and learn alongside Amaryllis about the importance of letting the people you love into your orbit.</p>
<p>You will love this book if you love young adult fiction; coming of age stories that bring light to the importance of mental health awareness; want to come along on a riveting journey to Gloucester, Salem, and more; or want to discover relatable characters struggling with many of the same challenges we all face every day (just with a witchy twist).<br/><br/>The Lost Winds speaks to younger and older readers alike who want to embark on the exhilarating, nostalgia-tinged travels of teenagers living in a COVID-free world during one unforgettable summer.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I hope that The Lost Winds inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why is bravery held separate from vulnerability?</li>
<li>How prevalent is groupthink in today’s society? Are the startling patterns of human behavior unveiled in the Salem Witch Trials just as relevant today as they were centuries ago?</li>
<li>Do the rigid conventions of society hold unique individuals captive from the moment they are born?</li>
</ul>
<p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers!</p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>A Case of Culture is a nonfiction book about the unspoken challenges and hesitancies faced by immigrant patients in seeking healthcare. In the book, I advocate for the need for cultural brokership to address and alleviate these cultural challenges in the healthcare setting.<br/><br/>My name is Snigdha Nandipati and I am the author of A Case of Culture. As someone whose family stocked kitchen herbs in our medicine cabinet and hated going to the doctor’s, I wanted to bring to light the cultural reasons behind these fears and hesitancies towards seeking medical treatment. Though this hesitancy towards Western medicine is one that widely exists, the reasons behind it are hardly talked about. So, I wrote this book in order to explore these reasons and to share the stories of cultural brokers that work to ease these hesitancies.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how a cultural broker works to enhance the patient-doctor relationship across cultural differences. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the role of culture, language, and spirituality in healing and medicine. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you better understand how culture plays a role in the medical care that is provided, and how cultural brokers work to fill the culture gap in healthcare.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn how cultural brokers advocate for their patients and build cultural humility in the healthcare setting. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>the Hindu doctor who chanted an Islamic Kalima prayer for her dying Muslim patient</li>
<li>the son who encouraged his Italian father to open up to his doctor about his medication noncompliance</li>
<li>the hospitalist who called her elderly Indian patient “Aunty” to help her feel more at home in this strange environment and new country</li>
<li>the Latino Evangelical priest who used his sermon to encourage worshippers to get vaccinated against COVID-19</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>You will love this book if you have ever helped your family members navigate the challenges of Western medicine, if you find yourself straddling two or more cultures on a daily basis, or if you are interested in topics of culture and anthropology as applied to healthcare.</p>
<p>A Case of Culture is a nonfiction book that speaks to healthcare providers and immigrant families who want to look at culture and healthcare in a new way.</p>

A Case of Culture is a nonfiction book about the unspoken challenges and hesitancies faced by immigrant patients in seeking healthcare. In the book, I advocate for the need for cultural brokership to address and alleviate these cultural challenges in the healthcare setting.My name is Snigdha Nandipati and I am the author of A Case of Culture. As someone whose family stocked kitchen herbs in our medicine cabinet and hated going to the doctor’s, I wanted to bring to light the cultural reasons behind these fears and hesitancies towards seeking medical treatment. Though this hesitancy towards Western medicine is one that widely exists, the reasons behind it are hardly talked about. So, I wrote this book in order to explore these reasons and to share the stories of cultural brokers that work to ease these hesitancies.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how a cultural broker works to enhance the patient-doctor relationship across cultural differences. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the role of culture, language, and spirituality in healing and medicine. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you better understand how culture plays a role in the medical care that is provided, and how cultural brokers work to fill the culture gap in healthcare.In this book, you'll learn how cultural brokers advocate for their patients and build cultural humility in the healthcare setting. You'll hear stories such as...

the Hindu doctor who chanted an Islamic Kalima prayer for her dying Muslim patient
the son who encouraged his Italian father to open up to his doctor about his medication noncompliance
the hospitalist who called her elderly Indian patient “Aunty” to help her feel more at home in this strange environment and new country
the Latino Evangelical priest who used his sermon to encourage worshippers to get vaccinated against COVID-19

 
You will love this book if you have ever helped your family members navigate the challenges of Western medicine, if you find yourself straddling two or more cultures on a daily basis, or if you are interested in topics of culture and anthropology as applied to healthcare.
A Case of Culture is a nonfiction book that speaks to healthcare providers and immigrant families who want to look at culture and healthcare in a new way.

It illustrates valuable lessons and perspectives on leadership, management, culture, values, and team-building through an entertaining fictional narrative.My name is Paul Tozour and I am the author of The Four Swords. I wrote this book because I’m passionate about improving the state of leadership in the game industry, and about the intersection of game industry culture and modern management science.My hope is that this book will introduce readers to many key concepts in management science that the game industry often misses, in addition to offering a unique and entertaining in-the-trenches perspective on game development culture. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to learn alongside the four protagonists about the critical role of values, the realities of modern game development and game studio culture, and the way values and culture impact project outcomes.Update (July 18): An early draft of the manuscript for The Four Swords won the July 2021 Firebird Book Awards in three categories: Leadership, Business / General, and Cross-Genre!            The NarrativeThe Four Swords tells the story of Jake, Leo, Tim, and Allison, four passionate, dedicated game developers working hard to make their respective game projects successful.                                Jake and Leo work on Project Thundercloud 2 at the fictional game studio Scrub-Liminal Studios in downtown Austin, where Jake leads the programming team and Leo works as a Senior Designer.  Although the sequel to a successful and innovative game, the sequel is facing an increasing number of challenges.                                Meanwhile, Tim and Allison work at the fictional game studio Green Gryphon Games on the outskirts of Austin, which is building a highly anticipated sci-fi space exploration sandbox game called Norman’s Ark.  Tim works as a Senior Producer, and Allison is in charge of PR and marketing.                                The four game developers regularly assemble inside a fictional massively-multiplayer game Dream of Dragons, where they work together to slay dragons that guard four magical swords (shown in the cover illustration). Along the way, they team up with a wise helper who guides them to define their values and helps them organize their thoughts as they struggle with difficult decisions around technology, game design, creative direction, team dynamics, risk management, project planning, production, prioritization, negotiation, customer communication, and the tricky art of “managing up.” You will love this book:
If you enjoy learning about leadership, values, culture, and team-building.
If you’re looking for a highly entertaining story that illustrates all of these.
If you have an interest in the video game industry, video game development culture, and the unique challenges that developers in the industry face, or want to deepen your understanding of team dynamics in software development in general.
 Ultimately, I hope that The Four Swords inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue about how we can improve the quality of leadership, management, and production in the game industry; how we can better align teams toward a common goal; how we can better select, promote, prepare, and train game industry leaders; and how we can improve efficiency without burning out the talent and driving so many developers out of the industry. Early PraiseEarly beta readers of the book have said: Great job bringing it all together in the end ... It has been my pleasure reading your book. Thank you for giving me this opportunity.I look forward to seeing it published.-Eric B, agile & leadership consultant Remember episode 5 of Mythic Quest? This book is like that, only for all disciplines. Frankly, this would make a far better show than Mythic Quest does, at least for developers.-Jake S, veteran game developer Congratulations on making something I didn’t think was possible. I’ll be recommending this to lots of people. -John H, veteran game developer I think you’ve created a great ‘mirror’ for studios and individuals to hold up to themselves. I see people reading it, or being asked to read it, and simply reflecting on themselves, their team, their company and how that impacts what happens in their workplace.The afterword is super helpful, and I love that it is so personal. It demonstrates your values and critically the behaviours that underpin a strong culture (a great starting point for a studio).Awesome job Paul, I really enjoyed it.-Chris J, leadership consultant Genuinely enjoying the tone and pacing of your novel … I think it's going to sell really well.  You always, always, end your chapters perfectly.-Jared R, book editor ""Crunch!

<h3>a new <i>Dragon Precinct </i>story and a new tale of Cassie Zukav, weirdness magnet</h3>
<p>In 2004, I launched the world of Flingaria and the stories of the Cliff's End Castle Guard with the novel <i>Dragon Precinct</i>, as well as a short story in the anthology <i>Murder by Magic</i>. In the 15 years since then, I've written five novels and more than a dozen works of short fiction in that universe, most of which chronicle the adventures of Lieutenants Danthres Tresyllione and Torin ban Wyvald of the Cliff's End Castle Guard. These meldings of high fantasy and police procedural have Danthres and Torin solving crimes in the bustling city-state of Cliff's End, navigating not just the criminal element, but also the politics of the demesne and the interference of the Brotherhood of Wizards.</p>
<p>Several of the dozen-plus works of short fiction in that universe have been released via the crowdfunding route, including some untold stories like Danthres &amp; Torin's first and second cases together.</p>
<p>In <i>Mermaid Precinct</i>, I jumped the timeline ahead a year and made reference to some incidents that took place in that year, including the Gorvangin Rampages. For my next story in the world, I thought it would be fun to tell that tale.</p>
<p>But wait, there's more!</p>
<p>In 2011, I had a story in <i>Tales from the House Band</i> that starred Cassie Zukav, a young woman in Key West who discovers that she's a Norse fate goddess, and has to stop Ragnarok, the end of all that is from Norse myth. Since then, Cassie has appeared in more than a dozen stories of her own set in Key West, featuring scuba diving, Norse mythology, folklore, rock and roll music, and beer drinking, not necessarily in that order, with a supporting cast that includes several gods, an immortal barfly, the ghost of a wrecker captain, the house band at an Old Town bar, and a federal agent. Cassie has encountered nixies, ghosts, possessed dolls, water fae, mermaids, and more.</p>
<p>Cassie's tales have appeared in a ton of places, including the second <i>Tales from the House Band</i> anthology, as well as the anthos <i>Bad-Ass Faeries: It's Elemental, A Baker's Dozen of Magic, Out of Tune, TV Gods: Summer Programming</i>, and <i>Unearthed</i>, the collections <i>Ragnarok and Roll: Tales of Cassie Zukav, Weirdness Magnet</i> and <i>Without a License: The Fantastic Worlds of Keith R.A. DeCandido</i>, and the online zines <i>Story of the Month Club</i> and <i>Buzzy Mag</i>. </p>
<p>And so for this crowdfund, I don't want to just give you an untold tale from the <i>Dragon Precinct</i> universe, but also tell a Cassie story that I've been dying to tell. In the three-part ""Cayo Hueso"" story (which appeared in <i>Ragnarok and Roll</i>), Odin died; in ""Fish Out of Water"" (in <i>Out of Tune</i>), Loki died. It was always my intention to bring them back in a story called ""Ragnarok and a Hard Place,"" and I'm adding that Cassie story to the rewards.</p>
<p>Plus there will be some nifty extras for folks who donate more, including free copies of my other short fiction, audio recordings of me reading the stories, tote bags and hand-made stuffies with the <i>Dragon Precinct</i> badge (seen above), and more!</p>
<p>Or, if you just want the stories, you can do that, too.....</p>
<p><strong>STRETCH GOALS!</strong></p>
<p>Since we've made our goal, now we're looking at stretch goals!</p>
<p><strong>If we reach $2000</strong>, then anyone who donates $15 or more will also get an eBook copy of my <i>Super City Police Department </i>novel <i>The Case of the Claw</i>.</p>
<p><strong>If we reach $2250</strong>, then all those who donate will receive a thank-you note e-mailed to you (those whose perks include a physical reward mailed to them will get a physical thank-you note included in the package).</p>
<p><strong>If we reach $2500</strong>, then anyone who donates $15 or more will get, not just <i>The Case of the Claw</i>, but the story bundle will include three additional stories.</p>
<p><strong>If we reach $2750</strong>, then anyone who donates $15 or more will also get, in addition to the above, an eBook copy of my <i>Scattered Earth</i> novel <i>Guilt in Innocence</i>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>If we reach $3000</strong>, I will fall over in shock. And I will come up with a stretch goal for that, too......</p>

<h3>The Story of My Book</h3>
<p>Make Book Club Lit Again is your guide to making book club better: four great book recommendations along with original recipes inspired by the books. Because when we eat with people and discuss ideas with them, we are also building networks and solidifying relationships.<br/><br/>My name is Colleen Connolly-Ahern and I am the author of Make Book Club Lit Again. This is a book I looked for myself. I thought, surely there’s a book club guide that suggests some great books, looks at the food history of the cultures they take place in and provides menus and other suggestions that would make the reader feel like they were eating along with the characters. But it wasn’t there. I love history, I love travel, I love books, and I love food. I started my career as an advertising copywriter, so I decided to write it myself.<br/><br/>This book is me — your nerdy friend who loves food, always has a book recommendation, and is raring to organize the next party. I’ve traveled a lot, and I love to share the foods I’ve eaten abroad by cooking them for friends at home. I want the reader to feel as excited as I am about reading a good book, cooking a new recipe, and then sharing the experience with good friends.<br/><br/>In Make Book Club Lit Again I’ve given you four very different book recommendations from different times and cultures. They’re accompanied by four international menus and other recommendations that will help bring the culture of the characters to life for your book club:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Korean menu to accompany <i>The Tale of Chun Hyang</i>, a traditional pansori.</li>
<li>A Medieval feast from France to go along with the Arturian romance <i>Erec and Enide</i>.</li>
<li>Iberian recipes to accompany the epistolary novel, <i>Pepita Jimenez</i>.</li>
<li>An English country menu for a <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> book club reread.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are a member of a book club hoping to turn meetings into events everyone looks forward to. It’s also a perfect framework for starting a new book club.<br/><br/>Make Book Club Lit Again is a nonfiction book that speaks to literature lovers and book nerds everywhere who want to look at their favorite characters and their book club in a new way.</p>
</div><div>

<li>The Copyediting for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</li>
<li>The Launch &amp; Promotion Efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this winter.</li>
</ul>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:<ul>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Colleen Connolly-Ahern is an associate professor of communications at Penn State University, where she teaches advertising and researches issues of social justice in international strategic communications. Her work has taken her to more than 40 countries, and introduced her to a wide range of characters and cuisines, many of whose stories she shares in her book. Make Book Club Lit Again brings together all the things she loves best: good books, great food, social history, and connecting with wonderful people. A self-proclaimed “cookbook junkie,” when she’s not grading papers you can usually find Colleen in the kitchen of her lovingly restored mid-mod ranch, whipping up new recipes and generally making a mess for her long-suffering husband (a.k.a. Lee “The Sous Chef” Ahern) to tidy up.<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Colleen Connolly-Ahern at colreads@gmail.com, on Instagram @colreads and on Twitter @Col_Reads.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.<br/><br/>The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies are expected to ship.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Not everyone can support, but that doesn't mean you can't get something out of it!<br/>I will reward the top 3 people who refer the most backers at the end of the campaign (30 days). Here's how:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the top of the campaign page, you will see the ""share"" buttons. Click on the ""chain"" icon to get a custom link just for you. (Note: don't use the URL in the browser window as it won't work to track referrals and you won't get credit ?)</li>
<li>Copy that link and paste it on your social media, email it to a friend, or text a fellow book lover.</li>
<li>When someone clicks on that link and backs the book, you get 1 entry!</li>

But it wasn’t there. I love history, I love travel, I love books, and I love food. I started my career as an advertising copywriter, so I decided to write it myself.This book is me — your nerdy friend who loves food, always has a book recommendation, and is raring to organize the next party. I’ve traveled a lot, and I love to share the foods I’ve eaten abroad by cooking them for friends at home. I want the reader to feel as excited as I am about reading a good book, cooking a new recipe, and then sharing the experience with good friends.In Make Book Club Lit Again I’ve given you four very different book recommendations from different times and cultures. They’re accompanied by four international menus and other recommendations that will help bring the culture of the characters to life for your book club:

A Korean menu to accompany The Tale of Chun Hyang, a traditional pansori.
A Medieval feast from France to go along with the Arturian romance Erec and Enide.
Iberian recipes to accompany the epistolary novel, Pepita Jimenez.
An English country menu for a Pride and Prejudice book club reread.

You will love this book if you are a member of a book club hoping to turn meetings into events everyone looks forward to. It’s also a perfect framework for starting a new book club.Make Book Club Lit Again is a nonfiction book that speaks to literature lovers and book nerds everywhere who want to look at their favorite characters and their book club in a new way.

About the Author
Colleen Connolly-Ahern is an associate professor of communications at Penn State University, where she teaches advertising and researches issues of social justice in international strategic communications. Her work has taken her to more than 40 countries, and introduced her to a wide range of characters and cuisines, many of whose stories she shares in her book. Make Book Club Lit Again brings together all the things she loves best: good books, great food, social history, and connecting with wonderful people. A self-proclaimed “cookbook junkie,” when she’s not grading papers you can usually find Colleen in the kitchen of her lovingly restored mid-mod ranch, whipping up new recipes and generally making a mess for her long-suffering husband (a.k.a. Lee “The Sous Chef” Ahern) to tidy up.For more information, you can connect with Colleen Connolly-Ahern at colreads@gmail.com, on Instagram @colreads and on Twitter @Col_Reads.

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies are expected to ship.
 

Other Ways You Can Help
Not everyone can support, but that doesn't mean you can't get something out of it!I will reward the top 3 people who refer the most backers at the end of the campaign (30 days). Here's how:

At the top of the campaign page, you will see the ""share"" buttons. Click on the ""chain"" icon to get a custom link just for you. (Note: don't use the URL in the browser window as it won't work to track referrals and you won't get credit ?)
Copy that link and paste it on your social media, email it to a friend, or text a fellow book lover.
When someone clicks on that link and backs the book, you get 1 entry!

<p>Have you ever really wanted to do something, but every time you tried you just couldn't get going on it? Me too! I don't know about you, but with me it was writing. I've always had <em>tons</em> of story ideas, but for some reason, whenever I sat down to write one of them I got distracted by other things.</p>
<p>A few months ago I decided it was time to really take the proverbial bull by the horns (because doing it to a real bull would not have helped my case <em>at all</em>, and would also probably have hurt quite a bit), and I made a public commitment to write a horror novel.</p>
<p>""How public,"" I hear you ask? First of all, you shouldn't interrupt people. Seriously. But to answer your question, I announced on a popular website that I would write a few pages of the story every day, and then post what I'd written. And if I missed a day, I'd post twice the following day to make up for it. 89 days and 77,000 words later, I had a finished horror novel sitting in front of me.</p>
<h2>Enough backstory, what's the novel about?</h2>
<p>Some people in an office building experience a power outage as power in the city goes down. As the building's generator and emergency lights kick in, people start exploding from the inside, for no apparent reason. It doesn't take long for our band of heroes, who begin the story spread out all over the building, to realize that the key to staying alive is to stay out of the lights. If there is light on them, they're going to die. And the sun comes up in five hours.</p>
<p>Oh, and did I mention that you can read the first draft <em>in its entirety</em> <a href=""http://roosterteeth.com/members/journal/entry.php?id=2854578"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">right here</a>?</p>
<h2>Cool. Now what?</h2>
<p>So now I have this massive first draft document, a complete horror novel. What am I supposed to do with it? Well, the next step is to edit it, and try to get it published. That's where you come in.</p>
<p>You see, editing a book like this takes time, and the way I've written it, I need to be able to focus all my energy on it or else it's going to take forever. Then I need to try to find an agent, which costs money, or self-publish, which also costs money. All pledges from this campaign will go towards covering my cost of living while I edit, printing out numerous copies of the manuscript in various forms, building a proper website for the book, and the publication process.</p>
<p>And the best part for you is that you don't even have to do anything on faith; you can literally read the entire first draft from that link I posted earlier, and then decide based on what you read whether you want to help bring this dream to life.</p>
<h2>Awesome. Then what?</h2>
<p>Yeah, what comes after this? Well, the next horror novel I want to write has to do with someone who gradually loses his grip on reality, until he literally replaces it with his own terrible version of it. I started writing this one a couple years ago, but got sidetracked (callback to the first paragraph FTW!), and now I want to get back to it. But I can't start working on a new novel until this one's all done with. Which means you aren't just funding one book by pledging to this campaign; you're funding two. That's double the value right there!</p>

<h3>The Story of Black, Mixed With </h3>
<p>At 27, I found myself gripped in adversity and down a slippery slope not only to statistically predicted poverty and socio-economics, but swirling in a lack of confidence and self esteem; contorting myself to align with culturally defined perspectives around race, culture, language and gender expectations. Often depressed and ashamed of the challenges that I had experienced, trying to make ends meet, I coined myself the “Black, Single, Broke Mom.” I examined the adversity I faced, embraced the lessons it taught me and recommitted myself to not just beating the odds, but transcending statistics. A bit of an alchemy, if you will, I found the power in authenticity and the value this brings as a catalyst to change.<br/><br/>Black, Mixed With is a creative memoir about finding authenticity through adversity. Adversity for me, strikes in being multiracial and presenting as Black in a racially charged America. This, along side confronting racism not only in society but in my family, facing poverty and raising a child in a single-parent household and ultimately pursuing a higher education and navigating Corporate America. <br/><br/>My experience is a convergence of diversity markers where the blows of racism, colorism, and classism are replaced with self-acceptance and a full display of unique qualities and characteristics that are not only powerful and beautiful elements of my being but an example that all people who are faced with challenges of authentic identity can relate to, regardless of circumstance. <br/><br/>Black, Mixed With is the story of a young woman who ultimately confronts the aspects of her life that have caused her shame, isolation and embarrassment and uses the lessons of adversity to transcend into living authentically and harnessing that power to connect, inspire and elevate others.<br/><br/>My name is Erica Kidder and I am the author of Black, Mixed With. I wrote this book because I want Black and Brown women to be empowered in who and all that we are. I want to share stories to inspire people to overcome challenges that hold them back and to accept that of which makes them uniquely them. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that adversity is not shameful; accepting and embracing unique challenges, regardless of what they are cultivated our unique perspective which is our diversity and our best competitive advantage, regardless of the arena in which you play. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to connect with your own experience and bring your authentic self to the table. <br/><br/>You will love this book if you’re interested in stories and experiences of diverse cultures, challenges in authenticity for multiracial individuals or empathize with the challenges experienced by Black and Brown Americans living in a racially charged America. <br/><br/>Black, Mixed With speaks to a multiracial audience, those interested in personal and professional development in leadership development and individuals grappling with identity acceptance in a world where you feel like you don’t always belong.  <br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Black, Mixed With inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<p>Why does our culture create predetermined stereotype “identity boxes” and how can we learn to embrace our uniqueness and express ourselves freely without feeling the need to “check the box”? </p>
<p>Connectedness to others is the pillar to success, but why are we so scared to share our authenticity with others to build genuine, solid relationships? </p>
<p>How can we remove the shame of challenging experiences and adversity and replace it with the courage to live truthfully and use it to build a bridge of empathy with others? </p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers!<br/> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>

</div></div>","The Story of Black, Mixed With 
At 27, I found myself gripped in adversity and down a slippery slope not only to statistically predicted poverty and socio-economics, but swirling in a lack of confidence and self esteem; contorting myself to align with culturally defined perspectives around race, culture, language and gender expectations. Often depressed and ashamed of the challenges that I had experienced, trying to make ends meet, I coined myself the “Black, Single, Broke Mom.” I examined the adversity I faced, embraced the lessons it taught me and recommitted myself to not just beating the odds, but transcending statistics. A bit of an alchemy, if you will, I found the power in authenticity and the value this brings as a catalyst to change.Black, Mixed With is a creative memoir about finding authenticity through adversity. Adversity for me, strikes in being multiracial and presenting as Black in a racially charged America. This, along side confronting racism not only in society but in my family, facing poverty and raising a child in a single-parent household and ultimately pursuing a higher education and navigating Corporate America. My experience is a convergence of diversity markers where the blows of racism, colorism, and classism are replaced with self-acceptance and a full display of unique qualities and characteristics that are not only powerful and beautiful elements of my being but an example that all people who are faced with challenges of authentic identity can relate to, regardless of circumstance. Black, Mixed With is the story of a young woman who ultimately confronts the aspects of her life that have caused her shame, isolation and embarrassment and uses the lessons of adversity to transcend into living authentically and harnessing that power to connect, inspire and elevate others.My name is Erica Kidder and I am the author of Black, Mixed With. I wrote this book because I want Black and Brown women to be empowered in who and all that we are. I want to share stories to inspire people to overcome challenges that hold them back and to accept that of which makes them uniquely them. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that adversity is not shameful; accepting and embracing unique challenges, regardless of what they are cultivated our unique perspective which is our diversity and our best competitive advantage, regardless of the arena in which you play. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to connect with your own experience and bring your authentic self to the table. You will love this book if you’re interested in stories and experiences of diverse cultures, challenges in authenticity for multiracial individuals or empathize with the challenges experienced by Black and Brown Americans living in a racially charged America. Black, Mixed With speaks to a multiracial audience, those interested in personal and professional development in leadership development and individuals grappling with identity acceptance in a world where you feel like you don’t always belong.  Ultimately, I hope that Black, Mixed With inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:
Why does our culture create predetermined stereotype “identity boxes” and how can we learn to embrace our uniqueness and express ourselves freely without feeling the need to “check the box”? 
Connectedness to others is the pillar to success, but why are we so scared to share our authenticity with others to build genuine, solid relationships? 
How can we remove the shame of challenging experiences and adversity and replace it with the courage to live truthfully and use it to build a bridge of empathy with others? I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers! What We Need & What You'll Get

<p><strong>Campaign Update</strong></p>
<p>I am humbled and awed by the tremendous support for my book. We exceeded the $9,000 target  for publishing in all formats--paperback, hardback, e-book, and audiobook--during the first week of the campaign!</p>
<p>Because my goal is to raise awareness about unfairness in the criminal justice system and the campaign has received such overwhelming early support, I'm planning to donate the net proceeds from  the last 20 days of the campaign (in other words, from August 3 forward) to The Innocence Project and Gideon's Promise. (The Innocence Project works to exonerate the wrongfully convicted through DNA testing; Gideon's Promise works to help train public defenders who can help provide equal justice for marginalized communities.)</p>
<p><strong>The Story of Presumed Guilty</strong></p>
<p><i>Presumed Guilty</i> tells the story of Emma Simpson, a New York hedge fund manager. Federal prosecutors are investigating the fund for insider trading. When they can’t make that case, they prosecute Emma for obstruction of justice based on an email she sent during the investigation. A woman who is successful in a challenging career while raising two children and has done nothing but send an email is now on trial for a federal crime and could go to prison.<br/><br/>My name is Alexandra Shapiro and I am the author of <i>Presumed Guilty</i>. I wrote this book to raise awareness about the fact that innocent people can be and sometimes are prosecuted for federal crimes. <br/><br/>As a criminal defense lawyer, I've handled a number of cases in which something unfair or wrong happened to a client accused of a crime. Often, justice ultimately prevails, but only after years of uncertainty. If you’re very lucky, you might be acquitted after a trial, or you might win an appeal if you were wrongfully convicted. Even in these scenarios, the harm to the person’s life is incalculable and irreparable. Worse yet, sometimes the system can fail regardless of whether you have ample resources and good lawyers, and you can go to prison. It can happen to anyone.<br/><br/>In sum, while our justice system is one of the best in the world, the scales are weighted toward the prosecution, and there are injustices. I wanted to tell that story from the perspective of a defendant to whom readers could relate—someone who might remind them of themselves, or a friend, family member, or neighbor. I also wanted to use a fictional story to make the ideas more accessible and to avoid the technical complexities of some of the real cases that helped inspire the book. <br/><br/>My hope is that the book will engage readers and provide an entertaining and suspenseful story, but also educate people about the realities of the criminal justice system. If more people understand the system, they’ll be more skeptical of how they view evidence if they are called upon to serve as jurors, and perhaps that will help produce more fair trials. In addition, I hope the book will inspire my readers to work towards criminal justice reform, in whatever small ways they can. And perhaps it will also help people understand that sometimes the solution to a problem isn’t to imprison people. <br/><br/>I'm planning to donate 25% of all contributions above the $9,000 audio book goal to two non-profit organizations, <a href=""https://innocenceproject.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The Innocence Project</a>, which works to exonerate the wrongfully convicted through DNA testing and to reform the criminal justice system, and <a href=""https://www.gideonspromise.org"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Gideon's Promise</a>, a public defender organization whose mission is to help train public defenders who can help provide equal justice for marginalized communities.<br/><br/>The book is set in New York City and Red Hook, a town in upstate New York in the Hudson Valley. The main character is Emma Simpson. She’s 45 years old, and she seems to have it all. She’s risen to the top of a male-dominated profession—she’s a successful portfolio manager who runs the New York office of a big-time hedge fund. She lives on a farm in Red Hook and commutes to the City so that her husband Pierre can run a local winery, and their children can grow up in a more livable rural environment. They have a big house and lots of land. <br/><br/>Everything seems to be going swimmingly, until March 14, 2012, when a seemingly typical day at the office sets off a chain of events that turns our heroine’s idyllic life into a nightmare. Unbeknownst to Emma, two ambitious federal prosecutors in Manhattan—Ted Hardin and Annie Waters—are hoping to make a big case against Emma’s fund, which they believe is involved in insider trading. When they can’t make that case because the evidence isn’t there, Hardin and Waters seize on an email Emma sent on her way home that fateful day. They decide to make “a federal case” out of an email Emma sent to her colleagues reminding them to follow a company policy about discarding unnecessary documents. <br/><br/>The book takes readers through Emma’s journey as the target of a federal white-collar prosecution: first, “lawyering up” and hiring a big-time former federal defender; then, navigating the investigation; and finally, a trial for obstruction of justice in the Southern District of New York. Readers will get a glimpse of how the federal criminal justice system works from the inside perspectives of multiple players—the prosecutors, the person facing prosecution, her defense lawyer, and even the jury.<br/><br/>Will Emma get convicted at the end of the trial? Or will she go home to her family? And even if she is acquitted, will that really be the end of her nightmare?<br/><br/>You will love this book if you enjoy crime books and legal thrillers, or if you are a lawyer who enjoys fiction, or if you interested in how the federal criminal justice system really works. <br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Presumed Guilty</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<p>How can we make the criminal justice system fairer? </p>
<p>What reforms can help ensure that prosecutors investigate with an open mind and don’t rush to judgment?</p>

And during decades of professional work focused on a different type of writing (crafting legal briefs), she also always secretly fantasized about writing fiction. During the pandemic, Alexandra decided to finally take the plunge and write her first book, a novel that she hopes will raise awareness about problems in our criminal justice system.<br/><br/>Alexandra is a native New Yorker. She has three children and lives in Manhattan with her husband, who is also a criminal defense lawyer, their youngest child, and Jorge, their standard poodle.

About the Author
Alexandra Shapiro is a partner and co-founder of Shapiro Arato Bach LLP, a law firm in Manhattan. She is criminal defense lawyer and one of the leading appellate lawyers in the United States. She was one of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's first clerks on the Supreme Court, and served as a federal prosecutor in Manhattan in the late 1990s. For a long time, Alexandra wanted to write a book based on her own experiences as a lawyer that would call attention to the fact that innocent people can be and are prosecuted in the United States. And during decades of professional work focused on a different type of writing (crafting legal briefs), she also always secretly fantasized about writing fiction. During the pandemic, Alexandra decided to finally take the plunge and write her first book, a novel that she hopes will raise awareness about problems in our criminal justice system.Alexandra is a native New Yorker. She has three children and lives in Manhattan with her husband, who is also a criminal defense lawyer, their youngest child, and Jorge, their standard poodle. When Alexandra isn’t writing, practicing law, or spending time with family and friends, she likes to travel and engage in outdoor activities like hiking, running, bicycling, and skiing. She’s also an avid photographer and news junkie.For more information, you can check out Alexandra’s new website and connect with her on Instagram and Twitter.

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Story of My Book</span></h3>
<p><u>The Thriver's Guide to Medical School </u>is a collection of personal stories, with supporting stories from experts worldwide, on the importance of grit, resilience, an optimistic mindset and an unmessable-with attitude. Olivia shares how to bounce back from any failure, setback, heartbreak or challenge and transform them into impactful and dynamic comebacks.<br/><br/>My name is Dr. Olivia Richman, and I am the author of <u>The Thriver's Guide to Medical School</u>. I wrote this book after I was dismissed from medical school and was told to find another career. I felt alone and depleted but knew I had to act if I wanted to bounce back, and that's exactly what I did! I wrote this book so that other people wouldn't feel alone in their struggles, hardships or failures. When they are ready to make a comeback, I provide personal stories and supplemental tools, research and thought-patterns that will change one's perspective to promote a thriving mindset instead of one conditioned to just survive. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover comfort in knowing that failing is normal (even encouraged!). Everyone is dealing with a struggle and it's always possible to bounce back. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for failure because I know that after any failure, can come a wild success. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool for turning fear into power, failure into growth, heartache into vulnerability, and anxiety into savagery.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about courage (speaking up in the face of fear) and that positive thinking is really, <i>really</i> effective. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<p>- The one where Dr. J, a prestigious plastic surgeon whose toxic and cruel attitude preceded him, began the surgery by screaming at me and ended it by adding me to his favorites list.</p>
<p>- The one where my mentor and dear friend died suddenly and how our group of peers dealt with his death.</p>
<p>- The one where I broke up with my medical school boyfriend, dated half the men - and some women - in NYC, only to find out that <i>I</i> was the one who needed to grow.</p>
<p><br/>You will love this book if you love heroic underdog stories that highlight the importance of having a fearless attitude and unwavering willpower in life.</p>
<p><br/><u>The Thriver's Guide to Medical School </u>is a nonfiction book that speaks to anyone who is a pre-med, medical student or resident. It is also for anyone who is currently dealing with a failure, loss, setback or challenge in life, and who is willing to learn how to overcome it <i>and</i> grow through it.</p>

You’ll learn about the life of a medical student, challenges any person may face, and insights on how someone can overcame these challenges.<br/><br/><strong>Section 2</strong> of each chapter is the <strong>Excerpt from the Expert</strong> where I share the opinion from an expert on the topic, whether it be a psychologist, researcher, or neuroscientist, this section contains their POV.<br/><br/><strong>Section 3</strong> of each chapter is the <strong>Overcomer’s Story</strong>, a story from an ordinary person who has overcome similar circumstances and how they did it. These include stories from TEDx speakers, Michelle Obama, and even my ex-boyfriend!</p>

<h3><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h3>
<p><i>Welp: Climate Change &amp; Arctic Identities </i>is a travel memoir about navigating social life in Tromsø, Norway (Romssa, Sápmi) as a Black, mixed-race girl from Alaska. Through vivid depictions of reindeer herding, intimate reflections, and fun stories about making community abroad, you’ll learn that climate change is inherently a cultural problem embedded in our relationship to the environment.<br/><br/>My name is Michaela Stith and I am the author of <i>Welp</i>. I wrote this book because the Arctic is warming at twice the rate of the global average, but most people don’t understand what those drastic changes mean for people who live in the north. While living in the Lower 48, I learned that many people think of the Arctic as an icy wasteland. I read many travel memoirs in preparation for my year and half in Norway, but even those books that acknowledged people didn’t warn about the racism I would encounter there.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover truths about the Arctic as it really is. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to enjoy a beautiful, <i>real </i>narrative about the north that fully considers racism, climate change, and other systemic problems northerners experience.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll explore the intersections of race and identity, environment, and the lessons I've learned through international travel. There are stories about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Living with Norwegian housemates and slowly building community.</li>
<li>Fishing, hiking and spending time outdoors in Alaska with my family.</li>
<li>Visiting reindeer herders in Sápmi and learning about the Indigenous knowledge that guides their livelihood.</li>
<li>Being a 5’2“-tall security guard at a Norwegian festival (take a guess how that worked out...)</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>You will love this book if you are a traveler, care about the environment, or want to learn more about the Arctic. You need this book if you think climate change is a problem, but one that only privileged people have time for. <i>Welp </i>speaks to northerners and southerners who want to grapple with social change and climate change in a new way — from a vulnerable and personal, deeply collaborative perspective.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>Welp </i>inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How do climate change and land use change affect Arctic communities?</li>
<li>Is Norway the liberal utopia imagined in America? (Short answer: no.)</li>
<li>What can Americans learn from the lifeways of people in Alaska, Norway and the broader Arctic?</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing Arctic climate change and identities will change us all for the better.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3><strong>The Book</strong></h3>
<p>The book is written in five parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the author’s note through chapter 3. Upon arrival in Norway in July 2018, I strived to make friends and build community. You’ll be introduced to my housemates and new bestevenn (best friend), read about Norwegian foods like brunost, and explore the international Indigenous music festival, Riddu Riđđu.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains chapters 4-6, where you’ll read about childhood memories and my family’s history in Alaska. The landscape in Norway causes me to reflect on the effects of climate change on the environment I remember growing up in. Through research and story-telling, I illustrate how national and global trends of anti-blackness manifest in the 49th state.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains chapters 7-9. Throughout autumn my friendship deepens with bestevenn. Though we grew up over 3,300 miles across the Arctic Ocean, we both experienced racism in our northern communities. You’ll read about vulnerable self-reflections, awkward interactions, as well as a physical altercation that happened at a Norwegian music festival, RakettNatt.<br/><br/>Part 4 contains chapters 10-12, which focus on subsistence livelihoods. I reflect on the months I lived in Iceland and what my host parents taught about sustainable, ethical meat production. You’ll also read about reindeer, reindeer herders, and the ways in which industrial development and government decisions hinder their adaptation to climate change.<br/><br/>Part 5 contains three final chapters and an epilogue. This section brings together the themes of climate change, race/identity and community. Ultimately, I’ll identify some of the cultural solutions needed to combat Arctic environmental change.</p>

<p><i>Machine See, Machine Do</i> is a book about the history of prejudice in the U.S. criminal justice system and how artificial intelligence and automation cause that history to repeat itself. This book provides a new perspective on the problem of algorithmic bias that focuses on history and policy decisions.</p>
<p>My name is Patrick K. Lin and I am the author of <i>Machine See, Machine Do</i>. I wrote this book because AI and other high-tech tools are often depicted as miracles that can fix the world's problems. However, they can also embed and reinforce bias and exclusion—even when they are used with the best intentions. Nowhere is this more problematic than in the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how pervasive and troubling this technology can be as well as how history informs the way this technology is being used today. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for algorithmic bias and the criminal justice system. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as an approachable guide to help you have a more nuanced understanding of how technology affects poor people and people of color, and what solutions exist to make our technology, as well as the way we use that technology, safer and more ethical.</p>
<p>In this book, you'll learn about how bias impacts both the design of technology as well as the use of technology. You'll read stories about:</p>
<ul>
<li>how algorithms and high-tech tools are used in policing, surveillance, forensics, sentencing, and parole;</li>
<li>how technology is used in unexpected ways, such as suggesting which neighborhoods to police, predicting whether someone is more or less likely to commit a crime, or determining how long someone's sentence should be;</li>
<li>how different lawyers, professors, technologists, AI ethicists, and activists have thought about and studied AI and its impact on our civil liberties.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>You will love this book if you are someone who cares deeply about criminal justice reform and the role of technology in our day-to-day lives. If you are someone who enjoys learning about how history shapes the present and how past decisions and policies still have lingering effects on today's communities, you will also get a lot out of this book. <br/><br/><i>Machine See, Machine Do</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to young people in law, policy, and technology spaces and those who are interested in developing safer, fairer, and more ethical technology. After all, our technology can only be as good as we are.</p>

<p>This book is written in five parts.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1: Ghost in the Machine</strong> contains chapters 1 and 2. Prediction works like a mirror. If predictive algorithms rely on historical data, what kinds of predictions will it make? This part introduces you to the problem of algorithmic bias as well as the different ways history influences the design and use of technology. This part explains how algorithms can embody and perpetuate prejudices that already exist. You will also read about the first documented instance of algorithmic bias, which involved a computer program used to screen student applications for admission to a London medical school.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2: Automating the Watchers</strong> contains chapters 3 to 6. This part explores the ways algorithms and automation encode racist police practices, such as broken windows policing, the war on crime, and stop-and-frisk tactics. As police departments across the United States adopt predictive policing algorithms, surveillance cameras, drones, and facial recognition, we need to investigate how these invasive and unregulated tools impact our civil liberties. I am excited to share what I've learned from conversations I had with AI criminologist and data activist Renée Cummings; Albert Fox Cahn, founder and executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (S.T.O.P.); and privacy expert Clare Garvie from the Center on Privacy &amp; Technology at Georgetown Law.</p>
<p><strong>Part 3: False Positive</strong> contains chapters 7 and 8. Forensic evidence has frequently been presented as an infallible and foolproof crime-solving tool. However, forensic science as a discipline has never been subjected to any rigorous scientific review. Worse yet, the algorithms designed to analyze DNA evidence are protected by trade secret laws, which prevent the accused from challenging the very results that determine their guilt or innocence. The truth is judges and juries have sometimes sent people to jail based on junk science. In this part, you will read about Clinton Hughes, a forensic DNA attorney at the Brooklyn Defender Services; Richard Torres, a criminal defense attorney and former DNA Unit attorney at the Legal Aid Society; and Jerome Greco, a public defender in the Digital Forensics Unit of the Legal Aid Society.</p>
<p><strong>Part 4: May it Please the Algorithm</strong> contains chapters 9 to 11. Algorithms are playing a larger role in how our justice system punishes people. Judges across the country rely on algorithms to predict someone's likelihood of committing a crime, using this information when making sentencing decisions. Today, algorithms are also used to tracking someone's every move while they are on probation, turning what some believe to be an alternative to incarceration into just another form of incarceration. In this part, you will read about Rebecca Wexler, a UC Berkeley law professor who has researched, written, and spoken extensively about trade secrets, technology, and criminal justice. You will also read about Aaron Horowitz, a computer scientist and chief data scientist at the ACLU.</p>
<p><strong>Part 5: Patching the Problem</strong> contains chapters 12 to 15. No matter how much our technology improves, if we do not also improve, bias will continue to live on in our systems and institutions. In this part, I propose three avenues that can be taken to begin to solve bias in our technology and criminal justice system. First, laws must be introduced to set standards and rein in this unregulated technology. Second, as algorithms affect the public's safety and liberty, we need to start thinking about tech companies and software developers as policymakers. Finally, we need to rethink humanity's relationship with technology. This may be a technology problem, but it is a problem created by humans, perpetuated by humans, and impacting humans. How do we even begin to fix the biased data and technology used in our criminal justice system if we don’t also think about how people treat other people? In this part, you will read insights from Frank Pasquale, a law professor at Brooklyn Law School and an expert on the law of AI, algorithms, and machine learning; Brandon del Pozo, a postdoctoral researcher at Brown University who served 19 years in the NYPD and four as the chief of police in Burlington, Vermont; Esha Bhandari, the deputy director of the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, where she focuses on the impact of big data and AI on civil liberties; and Liz O'Sullivan, the CEO of a new algorithmic fairness company called Parity.</p>

He is also currently serving as the Vice Curator of the Global Shapers Hub in Queens, New York, a World Economic Forum initiative. Patrick has worked for a variety of legal services organizations, including the DNA Unit at the Legal Aid Society, NYLAG's Special Litigation Unit, and the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. In law school, he also interned for Eisenberg &amp; Baum LLP's Artificial Intelligence Fairness &amp; Data Privacy practice. Previously, he interned for federal judges in the E.D.N.Y. and S.D.N.Y. Prior to law school, he was a technology consultant in Ernst &amp; Young's Data &amp; Analytics department. </p>
<p>Patrick wrote this book because he believes that despite the many ways technology makes our lives better, technology is also being used in cruel, invasive, and unexpected ways. He finds that AI and automation are often talked about as innovative new technologies that are constantly getting smarter. However, what is often overlooked is the human element: humans design technology; humans use technology; and, most importantly, humans choose how technology is used on other humans. Worse yet, when today's technology relies on yesterday's data, it will simply mirror our past mistakes and biases. Patrick wrote this book to be an approachable introduction and guide so that people can get as riled up about this problem as he is. </p>
<p>Patrick was born in Ontario, Canada, grew up in New Jersey, and has been living in New York City for several years. Outside of writing this book, Patrick enjoys oil painting, going to art exhibits, playing video games, watching movies, and spending time and cooking with his partner. </p>

</div></div>","Machine See, Machine Do is a book about the history of prejudice in the U.S. criminal justice system and how artificial intelligence and automation cause that history to repeat itself. This book provides a new perspective on the problem of algorithmic bias that focuses on history and policy decisions.
My name is Patrick K. Lin and I am the author of Machine See, Machine Do. I wrote this book because AI and other high-tech tools are often depicted as miracles that can fix the world's problems. However, they can also embed and reinforce bias and exclusion—even when they are used with the best intentions. Nowhere is this more problematic than in the criminal justice system.
My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how pervasive and troubling this technology can be as well as how history informs the way this technology is being used today. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for algorithmic bias and the criminal justice system. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as an approachable guide to help you have a more nuanced understanding of how technology affects poor people and people of color, and what solutions exist to make our technology, as well as the way we use that technology, safer and more ethical.
In this book, you'll learn about how bias impacts both the design of technology as well as the use of technology. You'll read stories about:

how algorithms and high-tech tools are used in policing, surveillance, forensics, sentencing, and parole;
how technology is used in unexpected ways, such as suggesting which neighborhoods to police, predicting whether someone is more or less likely to commit a crime, or determining how long someone's sentence should be;
how different lawyers, professors, technologists, AI ethicists, and activists have thought about and studied AI and its impact on our civil liberties.

 
You will love this book if you are someone who cares deeply about criminal justice reform and the role of technology in our day-to-day lives. If you are someone who enjoys learning about how history shapes the present and how past decisions and policies still have lingering effects on today's communities, you will also get a lot out of this book. Machine See, Machine Do is a nonfiction book that speaks to young people in law, policy, and technology spaces and those who are interested in developing safer, fairer, and more ethical technology. After all, our technology can only be as good as we are.


This book is written in five parts.
Part 1: Ghost in the Machine contains chapters 1 and 2. Prediction works like a mirror. If predictive algorithms rely on historical data, what kinds of predictions will it make? This part introduces you to the problem of algorithmic bias as well as the different ways history influences the design and use of technology. This part explains how algorithms can embody and perpetuate prejudices that already exist. You will also read about the first documented instance of algorithmic bias, which involved a computer program used to screen student applications for admission to a London medical school.
Part 2: Automating the Watchers contains chapters 3 to 6. This part explores the ways algorithms and automation encode racist police practices, such as broken windows policing, the war on crime, and stop-and-frisk tactics. As police departments across the United States adopt predictive policing algorithms, surveillance cameras, drones, and facial recognition, we need to investigate how these invasive and unregulated tools impact our civil liberties. I am excited to share what I've learned from conversations I had with AI criminologist and data activist Renée Cummings; Albert Fox Cahn, founder and executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (S.T.O.P.); and privacy expert Clare Garvie from the Center on Privacy & Technology at Georgetown Law.
Part 3: False Positive contains chapters 7 and 8. Forensic evidence has frequently been presented as an infallible and foolproof crime-solving tool. However, forensic science as a discipline has never been subjected to any rigorous scientific review. Worse yet, the algorithms designed to analyze DNA evidence are protected by trade secret laws, which prevent the accused from challenging the very results that determine their guilt or innocence. The truth is judges and juries have sometimes sent people to jail based on junk science. In this part, you will read about Clinton Hughes, a forensic DNA attorney at the Brooklyn Defender Services; Richard Torres, a criminal defense attorney and former DNA Unit attorney at the Legal Aid Society; and Jerome Greco, a public defender in the Digital Forensics Unit of the Legal Aid Society.
Part 4: May it Please the Algorithm contains chapters 9 to 11. Algorithms are playing a larger role in how our justice system punishes people. Judges across the country rely on algorithms to predict someone's likelihood of committing a crime, using this information when making sentencing decisions. Today, algorithms are also used to tracking someone's every move while they are on probation, turning what some believe to be an alternative to incarceration into just another form of incarceration. In this part, you will read about Rebecca Wexler, a UC Berkeley law professor who has researched, written, and spoken extensively about trade secrets, technology, and criminal justice. You will also read about Aaron Horowitz, a computer scientist and chief data scientist at the ACLU.
Part 5: Patching the Problem contains chapters 12 to 15. No matter how much our technology improves, if we do not also improve, bias will continue to live on in our systems and institutions. In this part, I propose three avenues that can be taken to begin to solve bias in our technology and criminal justice system. First, laws must be introduced to set standards and rein in this unregulated technology. Second, as algorithms affect the public's safety and liberty, we need to start thinking about tech companies and software developers as policymakers. Finally, we need to rethink humanity's relationship with technology. This may be a technology problem, but it is a problem created by humans, perpetuated by humans, and impacting humans. How do we even begin to fix the biased data and technology used in our criminal justice system if we don’t also think about how people treat other people? In this part, you will read insights from Frank Pasquale, a law professor at Brooklyn Law School and an expert on the law of AI, algorithms, and machine learning; Brandon del Pozo, a postdoctoral researcher at Brown University who served 19 years in the NYPD and four as the chief of police in Burlington, Vermont; Esha Bhandari, the deputy director of the ACLU's Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project, where she focuses on the impact of big data and AI on civil liberties; and Liz O'Sullivan, the CEO of a new algorithmic fairness company called Parity.

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Story of my Book</span></h3>
<p><i>Next Gen Customer Success</i> is about re imagining customer success, and providing a guide to the c-suite on how to build a customer-centric company. In my experience, it is easy to say ‘customer success is a core value or company-wide mindset’ but it is much harder to put that into action. Without clarity around the ‘what’ and ‘how’ of bringing this mindset to life, we default to building better silos, losing sight of the promise of success of our customers.<br/><br/>My name is Sasi Yajamanyam and I am the author of Next Gen Customer Success. In this book, I present a model that brings together different functions like Sales, Marketing, Product, and Customer Success (CS) to achieve the outcome of customer success. I also offer specific guidance to leaders of these customer-facing functions on how to work across silos.</p>
<p>My hope for this book is to change the conversation of customer success as not just a function but as the promise we make to customers. Concepts from this book will help leaders from different functions like Sales, Marketing, Product, and CS take specific actions to achieve customer-centric growth. If you believe everyone has a role in customer success, but not sure how to make that happen, you’ll find this book helpful. Ultimately, I want this book to help you deliver on the promise of success for your customers.</p>
<p>In this book, you'll learn about a new model for customer success, one that starts with a common understanding of customers and the changes that the department leaders should implement. Some key insights you will learn include:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to build a common understanding of customers, and what success means to them</li>
<li>How transforming employee experience is at the center of delivering exceptional customer experience</li>
<li>Changes needed to implement the new model across processes, incentives, skills, and systems</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you believe customers are the growth engine for your company, want to bring customer-centric mindset to life, and if you are looking for a framework to bridge the organizational silos.<br/><br/>Next Gen Customer Success is a nonfiction book that speaks to leaders of customer-facing functions from Sales and Marketing to Product and Customer Success who want to look at customer success in a new way.</p>

<h3><strong>Story of My Book</strong></h3>
<i>Take Charge of Your Life: Rewire Your Brain for Confidence, Focus, and Taking Action</i> is about how high-achieving women have overcome self-doubt, perfectionism, and negative self-talk, and have gone on to create successful lives and careers that fulfill them, and how you can too.<br/><br/>My name is Rachell Kitchen and I am the author of <i>Take charge of Your Life: Rewire Your Brain for Confidence, Focus, and Taking Action</i>. I wrote this book because there was a point in my life where the critical voice in my head, which I call a gremlin, was raging and running amok. Instead of proactively creating my life, my life was creating me. My gremlin’s annoying voice was on loud and repeat; it had me compromising my life and kept me playing small. As I coached other women, I noticed that I wasn’t the only one with a gremlin. There are lots of women who were like me. Who felt overwhelmed, stuck, and not in control of their lives. And like me, their gremlin impacted everything they were experiencing, including their relationships, physical health, and ability to reach their personal and professional goals.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover how this hidden, unexpected thing may be slowing you down or stopping you from creating the life you want and deserve. Ultimately, I want you to see this piece as a guide, helping you realize through the women’s stories told in the book where your gremlin messages are hiding and how you can benefit from doubting your doubts so you can level up in every area of your life.<br/><br/>In this book, you’ll hear raw, honest, and empowering stories from real women who have rumbled with the menace in their minds and won. Through these women’s experiences, you’ll discover how childhood adversity, societal and cultural expectations, and the opinions of others shape self-belief, inner expectations and create self-sabotaging and self-limiting behaviors that diminish your personal power. This book includes excerpts from successful female entrepreneurs, high-level professionals, heart-centered coaches, writers, and up-and-coming millennials who have learned the benefit of doubting their doubts and, as a result, have transformed their mental narratives to take their power back from their gremlins.<br/><br/>You’ll love this book if you appreciate personal once-in-a-lifetime moments of revelation and epiphanies, and you enjoy learning through this lens. And as a result, you have your own personal aha’s.<br/><br/><i>Take Charge of Your Life: Rewire Your Brain for Confidence, Focus, and Taking Action</i> is a nonfiction book that will speak to high-achieving women who are looking to get unstuck in their lives. It will also resonate with those looking to increase their self-belief and boost their confidence.<br/> <h3> </h3>

In this section, you will hear from women about their childhood experiences, the effect of perfectionism, learn about cognitive distortions, and ANTs (automatic negative thoughts) and how these elements chip away at your confidence.

In this section, women will share their stories of how cultural expectations, family beliefs, life traumas, and other outside influences affect their self-belief.

<p><strong><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The Story of Embodied: An Urban Yoga Monk’s Memoir + Manifesto for Modern Living</span></strong></p>
<p>Enter into the wild wisdom-experience of a modern urban yogi who used her life as fuel for radical personal transformation - for both herself and her students. Honing the ancient tools of yoga’s philosophy in entirely modern ways, this book is part memoir, part thought leadership, part toolkit for modern living. Accessible, deep, darkly humorous and inspiring.<br/><br/>My name is Swami Jaya Devi and I am the author of Embodied: An Urban Yoga Monk’s Memoir + Manifesto for Modern Living. I wrote this book because people need accessible, effective tools for thriving in today’s upside-down world. I share a modern take on yoga’s ancient teachings along with relevant stories of how they healed my life. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will be inspired, intrigued and empowered.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you are a spiritual seeker, a yogi or meditator, or someone dealing with everyday burnout looking for ways to fill your cup. Deep yoga philosophy is about becoming less fragmented and more you, which is the union, the wholeness, that yoga promises. These tools and teachings are potent and thought-provoking. They ignite a longing we all experience: to be understood, seen, valued, and loved from the outside in, but even more importantly, from the inside out.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope Embodied will give you tools to live a deeper, more fulfilling life. To access your innate wellbeing and live with an open heart. To love when it’s hard and when it’s easy, but to choose love and integrity over and over again, loving anyway. I hope my book will help you realize that love is always a choice (maybe the most powerful one we make) until it becomes a way of being and living in the world.</p>

<p><i>Redefining Motivation: Finding Success through Meaningful Connections </i>unveils a new framework in which to view motivation, inspiration, and pursuing all of your passions. <strong>This book will show you that it is possible to do multiple things at once, and in fact, it’s actually better if you do that.</strong><br/><br/>When I was younger, it was so hard for me to answer the question: “what do you want to be when you grow up?”<strong> </strong>It wasn’t that I didn’t have hobbies and interests; the problem was that I <i>had too many to choose from.</i> Now, even though I’m a full time educator, I still make it a priority to pursue all of my passions at the same time. I’ve found that, in doing so, I am able to <strong>see connections between them that weren’t obvious before.</strong><br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading <i>Redefining Motivation</i>, you will learn to leverage the connections between your own interests. In this book, I hope to instill in you the belief that motivation and success are both subjective. <strong>There is no such thing as an unmotivated person; anyone is able to become motivated on their own terms.</strong><br/><br/>Ultimately, I want you to use this as a tool to help you pursue every passion without being overwhelmed.</p>
<h2 style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1623177273/psaftau5j5r59m1pblvy.jpg"" src=""""/></h2>
<p>In this book, you'll learn about how people's unique interests connect in unexpected ways. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How my love of poetry shifted into a passion for photography, and how being a photographer has influenced my work as a teacher</p></li>
<li>How Taylor Evans, a PhD student, scientist, and fashion blogger, combines her interests in science + style to build an audience</li>
<li>How Franca Muller Paz, a Baltimore City educator, musician, and organizer balances her many responsibilities with genuine self care</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You will love this book if you have always found yourself torn between multiple hobbies, unsure how to do them all, or if you feel overwhelmed in your current job, unable to find time to reflect, relax, and reset.</strong></p>
<p>The book is written in four parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Part 1 contains a comprehensive overview of the state of the world today, basic theories of motivation, and what generally motivates people. It ends with my own personal story regarding motivation and inspiration.</li>
<li>Part 2 introduces case studies that highlight why people think they can only do one thing, and why that perspective is wrong.</li>
<li>Part 3 expands on how it’s possible to do more than one thing, and details what aspects of society make it difficult.</li>
<li>Part 4 ends with a discussion on particular challenges that make “success” difficult to achieve for some people, and key actionable steps to pursuing one’s passions. A conclusion chapter wraps everything up, reiterating how to view motivation and success differently.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><i>Redefining Motivation: Finding Success through Meaningful Connections</i> speaks to people with multiple interests and people who want to look at the topics of motivation, inspiration, and success in a new light.</strong></p>

This book will show you that it is possible to do multiple things at once, and in fact, it’s actually better if you do that.When I was younger, it was so hard for me to answer the question: “what do you want to be when you grow up?” It wasn’t that I didn’t have hobbies and interests; the problem was that I had too many to choose from. Now, even though I’m a full time educator, I still make it a priority to pursue all of my passions at the same time. I’ve found that, in doing so, I am able to see connections between them that weren’t obvious before.My hope is that, in reading Redefining Motivation, you will learn to leverage the connections between your own interests. In this book, I hope to instill in you the belief that motivation and success are both subjective. There is no such thing as an unmotivated person; anyone is able to become motivated on their own terms.Ultimately, I want you to use this as a tool to help you pursue every passion without being overwhelmed.

In this book, you'll learn about how people's unique interests connect in unexpected ways. You'll hear stories such as...

How my love of poetry shifted into a passion for photography, and how being a photographer has influenced my work as a teacher
How Taylor Evans, a PhD student, scientist, and fashion blogger, combines her interests in science + style to build an audience
How Franca Muller Paz, a Baltimore City educator, musician, and organizer balances her many responsibilities with genuine self care

You will love this book if you have always found yourself torn between multiple hobbies, unsure how to do them all, or if you feel overwhelmed in your current job, unable to find time to reflect, relax, and reset.
The book is written in four parts:

Part 1 contains a comprehensive overview of the state of the world today, basic theories of motivation, and what generally motivates people. It ends with my own personal story regarding motivation and inspiration.
Part 2 introduces case studies that highlight why people think they can only do one thing, and why that perspective is wrong.
Part 3 expands on how it’s possible to do more than one thing, and details what aspects of society make it difficult.
Part 4 ends with a discussion on particular challenges that make “success” difficult to achieve for some people, and key actionable steps to pursuing one’s passions. A conclusion chapter wraps everything up, reiterating how to view motivation and success differently.

Redefining Motivation: Finding Success through Meaningful Connections speaks to people with multiple interests and people who want to look at the topics of motivation, inspiration, and success in a new light.

<p><u><strong>Campaign Update - New Hardcover Funding Goal of $6500</strong></u></p>
<p>With the $5,500 goal surpassed, the paperback and e-book are officially a GO! Thank you to everyone that has joined my Author Community by preordering <i>Redefining Success</i>. The outreach and support for my book has been truly humbling.  </p>
<p>Given the immense levels of support, my publisher (New Degree Press) sees an opportunity to push for the <strong>hardcover goal</strong>! Candidly, this is also something that I feel would be insanely cool. Don't hardcover books just feel good in your hands? With this in mind, the <u><strong>new <i>stretch </i>funding goal is $6500.</strong></u></p>
<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Redefining Success</i> is all about achieving greater happiness, fulfillment, and alignment in life around the things that matter to you! The book is the combination of a plethora of amazing interviews, extensive scientific research, and my personal experience. My work has shown that we each need to define what ""success"" means for ourselves because if we don’t live aligned with our own definition of success, happiness and fulfillment will remain elusive no matter how much we accomplish in life.<br/><br/>My name is Michael Biarnes and I am the author of <i>Redefining Success</i>. I wrote this book because I personally went through what I affectionately call an “Oh Sh*t Moment”, which made me completely rethink what I was doing with my life. Despite having what society would deem as “success” (wife, house, friends, professional accomplishments, etc.) I found myself struggling to balance everything in life, unhappy, and asking myself “Is this it?” After speaking with peers, mentors, and friends, I realized that I was not alone in this struggle. Through endless conversations, research, and lessons, the seeds for this book were planted.<br/><br/>I’m no guru (far from it!) but by sharing the stories of extraordinary individuals, some fascinating research, and my own personal journey, my hope is to give you a “cheat code” to redefine success for yourself so that you can achieve greater happiness and fulfillment in your own life. Ultimately, it will be your own answers and actions that will enable you to attain true success for yourself!<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the science of happiness and how others have redefined success for themselves. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>As an eight time Olympic medal winner, Apolo Ohno needed to completely pivot in his life at the young age of 28 to find his new true-north in life as he was forced into retirement from speed skating. Despite spending his entire life to that point eating, breathing, and thinking about speed skating, he needed to redefine success to find happiness and fulfillment again.</li>
<li>After a near death experience, Arianna Huffington needed to realign her lifestyle to literally save her life. The decision to prioritize her own wellbeing led to the founding of her new company Thrive Global, which is committed to ending workplace burnout and fostering wellbeing in the work place.</li>
<li>Despite living the lavish lifestyle of a Hollywood writer/producer, Matthew Berry decided to quit everything and “chase happiness” to pursue his passion blogging about fantasy football. This decision to work basically for free, eventually led to an Emmy award, a role in Avenger’s: Endgame, and becoming the face of the entire fantasy football industry for ESPN.</li>
<li>After coining the term “FOMO,” or “Fear of Missing Out,” Patrick McGinnis was living the high-life as an investment banker. That is, of course, until the financial crisis of 2008 saw him lose nearly everything. This wake up call forced him to reflect and reprioritize his life around the things that truly mattered to him leading to him becoming a modern day Renaissance Man.</li>
</ul>
<strong>You will love this book if you find yourself:</strong><ul>
<li>Grappling with how to balance all of your priorities in life.</li>
<li>Feeling unhappy or unfilled despite achieving what society deems to be success.</li>
<li>Asking “is this really what I want in life?”</li>
<li>Wanting to learn and grow as an individual in your quest for personal development.</li>
<li>Craving a fun new book that will provide a few laughs, interesting stories, and useful lessons along the way.</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Book - <i>Redefining Success</i>
</h3> The book is written in <b>2</b> parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1 </strong>contains the introduction + chapters 1-6. I’ll introduce you to a number of wonderful and inspiring individuals who regardless of wealth, title, or career trajectory found themselves in dire need of change. Some had to experience something similar to what I went through, an “Oh Sh*t Moment,” in which a sudden external event made them seriously question what the hell they were doing with their lives. Others had a more gradual realization that something was off and that change was needed, culminating with a brave decision to confront their own internal fears to make a necessary pivot. I’ll sprinkle some of my research throughout, but Part 1 is largely story time!<br/><br/><strong>Part 2 </strong>contains chapters 7-11 and the conclusion. I’ll synthesize and share the science of happiness, crucial mentalities, and tangible tactics that I uncovered throughout my own personal quest and conversations with the individuals in Part 1. Chapter 11 also includes a framework so that you can ultimately define success for yourself! In the conclusion, I’ll culminate with a deep dive into my own personal story and how I have implemented the learnings from this journey into my own life.<br/> <h3> </h3>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><br/><i>Power of Inaction</i> is for those that want a result, an outcome. Which is pretty much all of us. Platitudes such as ‘Money/success isn’t everything’ aside, we are always working toward an outcome: a job, a life partner, children, a startup exit, a non-profit launch, cure for cancer, 3x revenue in 3 years... The more ambitious and goal oriented we are, the more we start chasing action in order to chase results and outcomes<br/><br/>The book investigates the downside of action bias which makes us chase action and explores the power of inaction as a choice to getting remarkable results. While chasing action can very well lead to results, it also leads to fatigue, burnout and mistakes. On the other hand mastering action helps us achieve remarkable results faster, without the cost of ‘doing’. And the fastest way to mastering action is by leveraging the power of strategic inaction<br/><br/>In the pages of this book, we will study what strategic inaction looks like in the real world, through extensive research and interviews with over 30 successful CEOs, investors, pro athletes, business leaders, officers in the armed forces across the globe. We will look to neuroscience and research to learn about the interesting role ‘inactivity’ plays in driving creative thinking and progress<br/><br/>Contrary to the usual action-packed formulaic advice such as ‘Ten things you need to do to fill-in-your-goal’, this book explores choosing not defaulting to action. What if we didn’t do what the experts and wisdom of the masses ask us to do? What if we, like the CEO of a major global medical imaging firm who was informed of the death of a child caused by a machine made by his company, went for a 2-hour walk instead of calling an emergency staff meeting and lawyering up? What if we, like General Kutuzov of Russia, when faced with an oncoming assault from Napoleon’s Grand Army, choose to retreat instead of fighting even when everyone around us; our lieutenants, the public, even the Bossman Czar, expects us to?<br/><br/>Spoiler alert: they both get remarkable and unexpected positive results<br/><br/>You will love this book if you are ambitious and driven, whether you are in your 20s or 50s, whether what you want is a job, to build your business, or raise funds for your cause. You will love this book if you want results and are willing to find a more efficient way to getting there<br/> </p>
<h3>The Book - <i>POWER OF INACTION</i>
</h3>
<br/>The book is written in 4 parts<br/><br/>In Part 1, we will start with an Introduction that captures the intent and promise of the book. We will then explore why and how we got here. We will explore how ambition, aspiration and even self awareness create progress, as well as the tendency of chasing action<br/><br/>Part 2 is all about the major obstacles to mastering action, our tendency to default to a playbook, create narrow and rigid goals and to create cause and effect where none exists<br/><br/>Part 3 explores habits we can develop to counter our action bias. We will discover how day dreaming, mind wandering, laziness and procrastination, usually scorned behaviors, can actually provide access to mastery of action. We will learn about the power of silence and how it can be leveraged to getting remarkable results in meetings, negotiations and other aspects of life<br/><br/>While action and inaction may seem like black and white choices, Part 4 will show that the mastery of action requires rising above this apparent dichotomy. Part 4 will also have a summary takeaway of the lessons learned throughout the book<br/> <h3>Where the Funds Go &amp; What You'll Get</h3>

Power of Inaction is for those that want a result, an outcome. Which is pretty much all of us. Platitudes such as ‘Money/success isn’t everything’ aside, we are always working toward an outcome: a job, a life partner, children, a startup exit, a non-profit launch, cure for cancer, 3x revenue in 3 years... The more ambitious and goal oriented we are, the more we start chasing action in order to chase results and outcomesThe book investigates the downside of action bias which makes us chase action and explores the power of inaction as a choice to getting remarkable results. While chasing action can very well lead to results, it also leads to fatigue, burnout and mistakes. On the other hand mastering action helps us achieve remarkable results faster, without the cost of ‘doing’. And the fastest way to mastering action is by leveraging the power of strategic inactionIn the pages of this book, we will study what strategic inaction looks like in the real world, through extensive research and interviews with over 30 successful CEOs, investors, pro athletes, business leaders, officers in the armed forces across the globe. We will look to neuroscience and research to learn about the interesting role ‘inactivity’ plays in driving creative thinking and progressContrary to the usual action-packed formulaic advice such as ‘Ten things you need to do to fill-in-your-goal’, this book explores choosing not defaulting to action. What if we didn’t do what the experts and wisdom of the masses ask us to do? What if we, like the CEO of a major global medical imaging firm who was informed of the death of a child caused by a machine made by his company, went for a 2-hour walk instead of calling an emergency staff meeting and lawyering up? What if we, like General Kutuzov of Russia, when faced with an oncoming assault from Napoleon’s Grand Army, choose to retreat instead of fighting even when everyone around us; our lieutenants, the public, even the Bossman Czar, expects us to?Spoiler alert: they both get remarkable and unexpected positive resultsYou will love this book if you are ambitious and driven, whether you are in your 20s or 50s, whether what you want is a job, to build your business, or raise funds for your cause. You will love this book if you want results and are willing to find a more efficient way to getting there 
The Book - POWER OF INACTION

The book is written in 4 partsIn Part 1, we will start with an Introduction that captures the intent and promise of the book. We will then explore why and how we got here. We will explore how ambition, aspiration and even self awareness create progress, as well as the tendency of chasing actionPart 2 is all about the major obstacles to mastering action, our tendency to default to a playbook, create narrow and rigid goals and to create cause and effect where none existsPart 3 explores habits we can develop to counter our action bias. We will discover how day dreaming, mind wandering, laziness and procrastination, usually scorned behaviors, can actually provide access to mastery of action. We will learn about the power of silence and how it can be leveraged to getting remarkable results in meetings, negotiations and other aspects of lifeWhile action and inaction may seem like black and white choices, Part 4 will show that the mastery of action requires rising above this apparent dichotomy. Part 4 will also have a summary takeaway of the lessons learned throughout the book Where the Funds Go & What You'll Get

<h3><strong>Story of <i>Incubating Impact </i></strong></h3>
<p><i>Incubating Impact: How Non-governmental Organizations Can Change the World</i> seeks to understand how non-governmental organizations (NGOs) can improve (and sometimes unintentionally hurt) the people they are trying to help. Using examples of human rights work and international aid, Incubating Impact reveals that human capital is the greatest asset of any NGO.<br/><br/>My name is Nicole Zehner and I am the author of <i>Incubating Impact</i>. I wrote this book because the world of international aid has always fascinated me. The desire to help others is one of the fundamental characteristics of humans, but the actual act of helping can be more complicated than what first meets the eye.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the complex role that NGOs play in human rights and international aid. I hope to instill in you the same passion and excitement that I have for human rights. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you navigate the complex world of international aid.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you are interested in world affairs, want to learn more about helping others, and/or want to learn something new!<br/><br/><i>Incubating Impact</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to students and potential donors who want to look at NGOs and aid in a new way.<br/> </p>
<h3><strong>Contents of <i>Incubating Impact</i> </strong></h3>
<p>The book is written in three parts. Each part expands upon a different principle that is vital to understanding the successful distribution of aid.<br/><br/>Part 1: Public Opinion Matters<br/>People often will go into helping others without first stopping to ask and learn what type of help is actually needed. This can lead to failed projects, frustration, and wasted money. Likewise, in the human rights field, long reports and research into the human rights conditions of a country can fall on deaf ears if the public isn’t engaged with the issue.<br/><br/>Part 2: Leverage Your Skills and Unique Resources<br/>People will often engage in unskilled labor when they volunteer. While this can be tremendously helpful, it can sometimes also become inefficient, especially when people spend excessive money traveling to the locations in need of assistance. It is important for people to prioritize their unique skills, such as medical or building expertise, in order to do the most help.<br/><br/>Part 3: Use a Multi-Faceted Approach<br/>There are many different ways to help people. Legal change, monetary aid, and medical support can all help the same people in different ways. While a single NGO will naturally need a specific focus, it must understand the different methods for executing its goals. Sometimes, an NGO will fail to provide sufficient aid because it does not realize that multiple approaches may be needed to achieve the goal.<br/> </p>

</div></div>","The Story of UNFORTUNATE
UNFORTUNATE is a young adult fantasy novel about bravery despite fear. Explore a world divided by Gifteds, those born for greatness, and by Unfortunates, those born for servitude. Follow Nora, an Unfortunate servant, as she breaks away from her fated life and becomes Galdor Academy's first Unfortunate student.My name is Kailey Bright and I am the author of UNFORTUNATE. This book has been unfolding in my mind for four years—and I can finally spill my imagination onto paper! I wrote this book because I want to write stories my younger self would admire, and I want to navigate important social issues that deeply affect me.You will love this book if you want to explore feminist and classist themes in a fantasy world not too far from our own; you enjoy fun and compelling characters with supernatural powers; or you love rooting for the underdog.UNFORTUNATE speaks to rising teens and adults who are exploring who they are, breaking out of social expectations, and striving for a better future for themselves.Ultimately, UNFORTUNATE ignites your soul—my book can inspire you to take charge of your destiny and take that first brave step forward.I look forward to sharing more of my publishing process and beyond with you!

I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies are expected to ship.

Noé parle français.They're best friends, and they understand each other perfectly.First of its kind, this board book is a bilingual children's book with a twist: teaching languages through stories. After reading this book, kids will learn how to count from 1 to 10 both in English AND in French, and learn new words and sentences in both languages.The storyline is simple, focusing on the lesson behind it. At the end of the book, there is a glossary summarizing all the different words and sentences the kids learned. Additionally, to help you with the translation, you will find a link at the end of the book for the full story in both languages.The project doesn't stop with this book! I explain our future plans and objectives below (in ""What's next?"").Page previews: Like so many families, my husband and I come from multilingual backgrounds. We're both originally Lebanese and speak three languages fluently (and a fourth one strenuously).  We would like to pass that skill on to our two wonderful sons. After thorough research, we were not able to find interesting and engaging bilingual stories for our kids to enjoy. We started with the ""word for word"" books, but our three-year-old learned them quickly and needed more. So we tried the stories that have separate repeated paragraphs for each language. He lost interest in them, fast.So if you can't find, create!Initially, I wrote a simple story and printed my first ""homemade"" book. My Eureka moment came after seeing how fun it was for my eldest and how quickly he learned. He began repeating and translating what we were reading, and screamed with excitement ""encore Zo et Noé!"" After that, I shared my idea with a few close friends and it blossomed into this project. This book is perfect for children from zero to five years old. Infants, toddlers and preschoolers will enjoy it a lot and have fun with Zo & Noé. It will build up their confidence in languages and keep them interested in learning and challenging themselves.Parents who want to expand their little ones' linguistic skills and expose them to English and French equally will truly appreciate the idea behind this project. It will create an ongoing conversation throughout the day, since the storyline is inspired by kids' everyday routines. OPOL method: One Parent, One Language. We used this approach to teach our children languages and it worked for us. This is one method that we actually use in our daily life, like so many bilingual families: 1 conversation, 2 languages. This book is only the beginning! I have already written additional stories to create a full series of 5 bilingual books with Zo & Noé, each focusing on a different subject.We're also planning one big alphabet book in both English and French.Eventually, if this is successful, we'd like to design new characters for other languages, and re-create the series in other bilingual pairs, like English and Spanish for example.With the help of educational and linguistic professionals, we believe that we can take this even further and set up educational materials that would complement the bilingual series, like playing cards, activity booklets, music. Our possibilities are endless!According to research and professionals, children from zero to six years old have the ability to distinguish different pronunciations, making them more receptive to learning more than one language. Moreover, kids who are multilingual are often at an advantage cognitively, academically, socially, and good at problem solving.The method of teaching languages through stories has always been around. Storytelling is a very effective learning tool. It makes it fun and entertaining, and helps in memorizing words and sentences without even realizing. When you are engaged and enjoying the activity, it creates a positive emotional memory.Stories also help put words in context, simultaneously teaching proper grammar and syntax, and providing full immersion. If you are interested in raising a young reader, check out this article by the NY Times. You can read more about this method of teaching here: https://bit.ly/3cNcSpG and https://bit.ly/3rJ9jFnFirst of all, thank you very much for your support and for taking the time to check out this campaign!To support this project and reserve your copy of the book, please select one of the following perks: The book donations will be sent to Assabil, a Lebanese NGO that promotes reading and free access to culture by creating public libraries and open spaces for cultural exchange for everyone all over Lebanon.It would mean the world to us if you could PLEASE SHARE this project with families, friends and individuals who would be interested in supporting innovative children's books for multilingual kids. Every little bit counts!Hi! My name is Faten, and I'm the creator and the writer of Zo & Noé. I'm an Interior Architect and a Product Designer by training. I have 2 beautiful sons: Zein and Neel. My husband and I are making sure they get the best education we can offer them- hence, this project. We are based in New York and absolutely love the city! Something charming about the city is the different languages you hear everywhere you walk. People always wonder where we're from when they hear us, which is part of the beautiful complexity of being from Lebanon!Marhaba, I’m Hanane Kai. I’m an illustrator and designer based in the mountains of Lebanon. My team, my right hand Maya Akiki, and I made the images you’re seeing here. Like most Lebanese people I speak three languages, so je comprends Zo and Noé when they speak to me. Zo insisted that his color should be yellow, so I couldn’t say no. I’ve illustrated around 20 children’s books, but this one is my first for toddlers. I hope you love it as much as I do!Self-publishing gives the ability for creatives such as ourselves to innovate and bring our ideas to reality, without compromise. However, it is not necessarily easy. It is risky for sure, and requires a lot of time and money to create, print, ship and market. Crowdfunding will not only help me fund this project and self-publish it, but it will also serve as market research. It is a good way to gauge interest and validate the demand for such a book. Furthermore, it will help reach parents who are interested in pushing the idea forward, and join us on this journey to bring Zo & Noé into the hands of the curious little ones.We want to do this right. That's why we are working with an award-winning illustrator, and using a premium printer that requires a minimum of 750 books for any project. Ultimately, printing and delivery are the most expensive costs to complete this book. Printing the book and delivering it by sea takes time. Books will start shipping to backers in August 2021. The story is already written, and the book's design materials are ready (mood board, color palette, characters, etc.), along with all the pages and illustrations. We are now finalizing everything, to have the design file ready for print.  Thank you!! (Français)Un livre bilingue en français et en anglais pour les tout-petits  De quoi parle ce livre ? Voici Zo & Noé.

<p><strong>Story of My Book</strong></p>
<p><i>UnlockED </i>is about how the right education can help each and every child unlock their full potential.<br/><br/>My name is David Pham and I am the author of <i>UnlockED</i>. I wrote this book because I graduated from a business school and I worked in several banks and corporations before I realised that education is actually what I care about the most. Therefore I started teaching and participating in education projects and startups. The reason why education personally interests me is because of my daughter. I started to think about her future and the future of her generation. I was thinking whether the current education system would be fine to maintain or if there is a way to provide her with the world class education suitable for the information age, no matter where we would be living. All of this pushed me to research and think more about the topic.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover stories and insights, for example from the Next School in India, The Big Picture School in Kenya, The Ørestad Gymnasium in Denmark, The Brightworks school in the U.S. or the Think Global School, where during the 3 years of high school study, students go to 10 countries, spread out between 5 continents. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for education and how it can unlock full potential for the generations to come. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you have a clearer picture on what is happening in education around the world and I hope that after reading this book, you can become an advocate, and ambassador to promote the best practices in education in your own country.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about mastery learning and different forms of blended learning. You'll hear stories such as from Himani Bhala, a 7th grader who shared that her passion lays in fashion design. Thanks to an innovative approach of her school, apart from learning academics, she could spend time working on her own passion project throughout the school year. Although in secondary school, as part of the programme, students at her school have real internships, and so she had an opportunity to learn in a real boutique shop and helped the shop by designing real, sellable clothes.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you are not happy with the current state of education and you want to see education to improve.<br/><br/><i>UnlockED</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to parents, teachers or anyone involved or wanting to be involved in innovating education. If you are dissatisfied with the current system of education in the place where you live and you want to do something about it, then this book will be your companion.</p>

It includes financial literacy, cultivating curiosity or self awareness. <br/><br/>Part 3 contains chapters 7-10 and is entirely about new methods in education, such as mastery learning, blended learning or learning styles.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p>Crisis Proof Leadership uncovers what the best leaders do during times of crisis. It would be easy to think that only the strongest, toughest, most cutthroat leaders would thrive in a crisis-filled environment, but that’s not the case. Highly empathetic, focused, values-driven leaders are better able to keep their teams engaged and thriving. Crisis doesn’t define leaders. Instead, the work they do before challenges and obstacles happen make them crisis-proof.<br/><br/>My name is Beth Rashleigh, and I am the author of Crisis Proof Leadership. I was inspired to write this book because in the last year, I’ve worked with so many leaders who were struggling to adjust their leadership style to all the chaos of the pandemic. It got me curious about the topic, and I wondered if there were proven techniques that would help leaders succeed in times of crisis. I found some really amazing ones.<br/><br/>My hope for this book is that it becomes a guidebook and tool kit for leaders. Leadership isn’t always glamorous, and it can be a lonely job. I hope this book helps leaders feel like they have someone in their corner cheering for their success.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll hear stories from successful leaders working in all types of industries, from healthcare to local and federal government to small businesses.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you are currently leading people, want to lead people in the future, or if you want to help and inspire others regardless of your role.</p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Book - Crisis Proof Leadership</h3>
<p>The book is written in three parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction and chapters 1-3. These chapters set up the context for the book and dig into the background of leadership in times of crisis, what leadership is, why people should step into leadership roles, and why understanding how to lead well during crisis is especially critical right now.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 4-6. This section focuses on what you might need to examine about yourself to lead well. Each of these chapters includes exercises and reflection questions that will help you gain clarity about why you do what you do, what you value, how resilient you really are, and how to get the best results. Each chapter is jam packed with activities, self-assessments, and practical tools like discussion planners that you’ll be able to use on the job right away.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters 7-11. This section shifts your focus to behaviors the best leaders demonstrate. Leading a team can be one of the most rewarding jobs in the world but to do it well, you need to come into the role with a service-oriented mindset. These chapters will help you build trust, demonstrate empathy. communicate clearly, and help others grow. Practical tips, tricks, and tools are given every step of the way.</p>

The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs for your signed copies within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies are expected to ship.
 
Other Ways You Can Help
Not everyone can support, but that doesn't mean you can't get something out of it!  I will reward the top 3 people who refer the most backers at the end of the campaign (30 days).
Here's how:

At the top of the campaign page, you will see the ""share"" buttons. Click on the ""chain"" icon to get a custom link just for you. (Note: don't use the URL in the browser window as it won't work to track referrals and you won't get credit)
Copy that link and paste it on your social media, email it to a friend, or text a fellow book lover.
When someone clicks on that link and backs the book, you get 1 entry!

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<i>Engineering A.I. Ethically</i> is about Artificial Intelligence and moral consequences. It explores the cross-section of technology, philosophy, and economy to come up with ethical guidelines for building A.I. responsibly.<br/><br/>My name is Alberto Maria Chierici and I am the author of <i>Engineering A.I. Ethically</i>. I wrote this book because I want to bring A.I. down to earth, explain it in an understandable way, and show the moral problems related to its development. As a data scientist (DS), I want to gather my experience and organize my thoughts around moral decisions in our everyday work for other DSs or engineers who don’t realize their job has plenty of moral decisions to make. It’s not just math and code. For business and policy leaders, I want to give different perspectives on the solutions to the AI ethical problem. Most work concludes that we need regulation and I believe we need to empower individuals to educate themselves and make better moral choices.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover what A.I. really is, how its moral problems are no different from problems humanity already faces, and how to tackle them. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for building a better world with new technologies. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you find your inner moral compass when developing, using, or sharing stories about tech with your community.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about A.I. 101 and its power to influence behavior. You'll read about...<ul>
<li>How the method by which machines learn, while inspired by how humans learn, has some material, spooky limits.</li>
<li>The influence of science fiction and movies on our perceptions of A.I.</li>
<li>A behavioral psychologist’s experience applying the science of influencing behavior commercially.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are passionate about new tech and science-fiction, want to learn more about technology, are a policymaker figuring out what AI is and what you should do about it, and/or a CEO or engineer developing an A.I. application and desire to do it the right way.<br/><br/>Engineering A.I. Ethically is a nonfiction book that speaks to A.I. fans and detractors alike, and makers of A.I. who want to look at morality at work and its societal impact in a new way.</p>
<p>When I publish the book, I plan to donate part of the profits to the <a href=""https://www.humanetech.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Center for Humane Technology</a>.</p>
<h3>The Book - <i>Engineering A.I. Ethically</i>
</h3>The book is written in 3 parts and won't take you too long to read (expected less than 50,000 words).<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction + chapters 1-3. The reader will learn about a brief history of A.I. showing that progress isn't necessarily a straight line. I'll dedicate two chapters to A.I. and Machine Learning 101 in layman's terms, accessible to everyone. Stories from business applications and academics show that A.I. is an engineering artifact, rather than a godlike power to create human-like intelligence.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 4-6. The reader will learn through case studies and stories from professionals and scientists about the limitations of A.I. There are inherent limitations (limits A.I. will always have), and historical limitations (limits given by the current state of technology that will likely be overcome). Readers will also learn morally good, bad, and grey-areas of existing applications of A.I. that they already use on a daily basis or are likely to use in the near future.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters 7-9. The reader will learn about how science fiction can be used to test society’s reaction to future or dystopian scenarios. From fiction to the real world, I’ll share stories about behavioral scientists and lay down the foundations of moral decision-making to help the readers find their inner moral compass.<br/><br/> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs for publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<ul>
<li>The <strong>editor</strong> I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in August 2021.</li>

<li>The<strong> copy editing </strong>for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.</li>
<li>The <strong>launch &amp; promotion </strong>efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this summer.</li>
</ul>
<br/>When I pre-sell 120 copies of my book, I will publish a paperback and ebook. When I pre-sell 150 copies of my book, I will also publish a hardcover edition. When I pre-sell 200 copies of my book, I will publish a hardcover edition and an audiobook.<br/><br/><br/>I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:<ul>

<h3>The Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Poetic Potential: Using Poetry to Unlock Your Voice</i> is the guide for women to find their voice in a society that often doesn’t listen or want to hear them. It explores the themes of healing, empowerment, and activism, showcasing how poetry is the key to women rediscovering their inherent value and power in the world.<br/><br/>My name is Amanda Karch and I am the author of <i>Poetic Potential: Using Poetry to Unlock Your Voice</i>. I wrote this book because, throughout this past year, I have realized how much poetry has impacted my life - increasing my confidence, boosting my public-speaking skills, helping me discover strengths and goals that I didn’t know existed. Through talking to other poets, I have learned that I am not alone in my journey. Countless other people have had similar experiences - with poetry becoming a lifeline, a mental outlet, a place of healing and discovery - and I want to show people the power and potential of poetry. The connection to female empowerment has to do with my own views as a woman on the external world because I believe women need to rediscover and utilize their voice and power to create true change in society.<br/><br/>Through reading this book, I want you to discover the potential and power that poetry has - that it is more than an elitist, inaccessible hobby that few people can do or make use of. But, more than the poetry, I want you to find your voice, confidence, and self-worth as a woman or understand that women have value in society too, if that isn’t how you identify. I hope that I am able to pass on my passion and knowledge of this topic to spread change throughout society, even beginning small with just one person. All it takes is one person to spark a movement and I want this book to be the tool that sparks the flame.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the power of poetry and how women can use it to regain their voice. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>a professor who used poetry as a way to heal from the grief of losing her brother</li>
<li>a poet who uses poetry to help show that patients with Alzheimer’s deserve a high quality of life</li>
<li>a non-profit director who uses poetry to empower incarcerated women to find their voice and feel valued in society</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you have a passion for poetry or writing, if you are an advocate for women’s rights, if you are a creative, and if you have an open mind.<br/><br/><i>Poetic Potential: Using Poetry to Unlock Your Voice</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to women of all ages and their allies - whether you are poets or not - who want to look at poetry and female empowerment in a new way.</p>

Amanda Karch is a senior at Babson College, focusing on data analytics post-graduation in December. She is a published poet and avid writer, honing the entrepreneurship skills from her college through her new path as an author.

Outside of writing, you can find Amanda running on her college’s cross country and track teams, reading multiple books at the same time, or trying to get her dogs to stop barking at everything.For more information, you can connect with Amanda Karch via email at amanda@akkwriting.com and on Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn.
International Preorders
For international preorders, please do the following:

Identify the perk that interests you, e.g. 1 or 2 paperbacks
Select the pink ""Back it"" button to ""Make a contribution"" for the same amount (this choice bypasses the shipping address page)
Use this form to share your mailing address, so I can calculate the international shipping costs and invoice you for that amount via PayPal/Venmo.

Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies are expected to ship.
Other Ways You Can HelpNot everyone can support, but that doesn't mean you can't get something out of it!I will reward the top 3 people who refer the most backers at the end of the campaign (30 days). Here's how:
At the top of the campaign page, you will see the ""share"" buttons. Click on the ""chain"" icon to get a custom link just for you. (Note: don't use the URL in the browser window as it won't work to track referrals and you won't get credit)

Copy that link and paste it on your social media, email it to a friend, or text a fellow book lover.
When someone clicks on that link and backs the book, you get 1 entry!

Please use #PoeticPotential and tag me as well as my publisher, New Degree Press, so we can help amplify your efforts! Tag:Instagram - @akkwriting / @newdegreepressFacebook - @akkwriting / @NewDegreePressThank you so much for all of your love and support!

As with all Blasted Tree print publications, design and quality are of the utmost importance, and so we are holding this pre-sale and fundraiser to build excitement for the books, scale our print runs appropriately, and cover some of the production costs associated with making art books. Rather than follow a traditional publishing model, which involves a lot of overhead and third-party mediation, we feel bringing these titles directly to you—our friends, families, and poetry communities—will be the best way to get these books into print and out to those who want them. We have lots of fantastic perks and bundles on offer in addition to the books, so be sure to check out the one-of-a-kind art contributed in support of this venture, and if you do decide to order a perk, <strong>please make sure you understand our shipping terms and schedule, explained at the bottom of this page</strong>.

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<i>Air Unplugged</i> is set in a futuristic world where on the first day of Ary’s job as a flight nurse, the helicopter flight to an ordinary, everyday call crashes, and Ary finds herself in a world unplugged from the rest of society.<br/><br/>My name is Olga Akopiants and I am the author of <i>Air Unplugged.</i> I wrote this book because of a personal experience I share with the protagonist where I considered, “What’s the worst that could happen?” Through re-imagining the worst case scenario, the main protagonist learned about the beauty of resiliency.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover new life philosophies. But I also hope that you have fun in cheering on the main protagonist in her quest to survive.<br/><br/>On a grander scale, this book is an opportunity to escape our current world of technology and reconsider the benefits and the drawbacks of it all; however, there’s no straightforward answer to that question. Throughout the book, I had a fun time exploring how the future might look with technology available for everyday citizens. <i>Air Unplugged</i> is an exaggerated example of our current world.<br/><br/><br/>THE NOVEL:<br/>The novel begins with red lights, all-seeing phones and advertisements that are convincing on the sensory level. But in an unfortunate tide of events, Ary is thrown into a world that is far from algorithms. It is a world that is not subservient to mankind and demands constant action for one’s survival — that being, nature. Ary was not prepared to live in this world.

Air Unplugged is set in a futuristic world where on the first day of Ary’s job as a flight nurse, the helicopter flight to an ordinary, everyday call crashes, and Ary finds herself in a world unplugged from the rest of society.My name is Olga Akopiants and I am the author of Air Unplugged. I wrote this book because of a personal experience I share with the protagonist where I considered, “What’s the worst that could happen?” Through re-imagining the worst case scenario, the main protagonist learned about the beauty of resiliency.My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover new life philosophies. But I also hope that you have fun in cheering on the main protagonist in her quest to survive.On a grander scale, this book is an opportunity to escape our current world of technology and reconsider the benefits and the drawbacks of it all; however, there’s no straightforward answer to that question. Throughout the book, I had a fun time exploring how the future might look with technology available for everyday citizens. Air Unplugged is an exaggerated example of our current world.THE NOVEL:The novel begins with red lights, all-seeing phones and advertisements that are convincing on the sensory level. But in an unfortunate tide of events, Ary is thrown into a world that is far from algorithms. It is a world that is not subservient to mankind and demands constant action for one’s survival — that being, nature. Ary was not prepared to live in this world. All that she knows is there is an inferior subpopulation of mankind that lives there.You will love this book if you are looking to speculate on what the future could look like and the sociological impacts of technology. You will enjoy this book if you are looking for action mixed with slow philosophical moments. Lastly, you might enjoy this book if you’ve been looking for a relatable read with a strong female presence.Air Unplugged speaks to women or fresh graduates entering their respective careers who want to grapple with the idea of resiliency.Ultimately, I hope that Air Unplugged inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:-What is a good life philosophy to keep for modern graduates?
-How does trauma change us? How can we move past trauma?
-How is technology affecting us?
-How does the business model of healthcare affect medical professionals?

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>The American Crisis: The Secret Behind Student Loans</i> is a book that looks at the student loan debt crisis in a new way. There are many sides to this crisis and, unfortunately, most of the people involved don’t know the full story.</p>
<p>My name is Meghana Boda and I am the author of <i>The American Crisis</i>. I wrote this book because I am interested in topics pertaining to finance, but also the legal aspect of many companies. The student loan debt crisis became an intense passion of mine after I watched a documentary episode on the issue late in the winter of 2020.</p>
<p>I hope that, in reading this book, you will discover certain aspects of the student loan debt crisis that people don’t necessarily want you to know about, and reveal certain paths we can take to better the impact of this crisis in the future. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the student loan debt crisis. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool that helps you take actions that change your life so you won’t be impacted, and/or encourage you to improve the symptoms of this crisis in those around you.</p>
<p>In this book, there are three main sections through which you'll learn about the causes of the crisis, things that are being done right now to fix the crisis, and what you can be doing right now to better the future. You'll hear stories like...</p>
<ul>
<li>Students impacted by the bills passed for student loan forgiveness.</li>
<li>The potential corruption of student loan servicers.</li>
<li>Personal stories of political figures such as Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez.</li>
<li>You will love this book if you are genuinely interested in student loan debt, if you want to get out of the crisis, or if you want to bring about change in your communities.</li>
</ul>
<p><i>The American Crisis: The Secret Behind Student Loans</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to high school/college students, parents of students, and people who were or are involved in the crisis who want to look at student loan forgiveness and student debt in a different way.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Book - The American Crisis</h3>
<p>The book is written in 3 parts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-2. This section focuses on the past — what happened to lead up to the student loan debt crisis. For example, one specific factor is college endowments.</p></li>
<li>Part 2 contains chapters 3-8. This part of the book focuses on the present — what is going on right now in terms of this crisis. Among the main topics addressed in the book are the bills and policies that are being put into place right now and how they are affecting people.</li>
<li>Part 3 contains chapter 9. This last section is about the future — what can we be doing to better the future of this crisis. A large part of this section addresses what the public can do without the help of politicians. Some small actions are definitely worth note-taking.</li>
</ul>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Get</h3>
<p>This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs of publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:</p>

The American Crisis: The Secret Behind Student Loans is a book that looks at the student loan debt crisis in a new way. There are many sides to this crisis and, unfortunately, most of the people involved don’t know the full story.
My name is Meghana Boda and I am the author of The American Crisis. I wrote this book because I am interested in topics pertaining to finance, but also the legal aspect of many companies. The student loan debt crisis became an intense passion of mine after I watched a documentary episode on the issue late in the winter of 2020.
I hope that, in reading this book, you will discover certain aspects of the student loan debt crisis that people don’t necessarily want you to know about, and reveal certain paths we can take to better the impact of this crisis in the future. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for the student loan debt crisis. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool that helps you take actions that change your life so you won’t be impacted, and/or encourage you to improve the symptoms of this crisis in those around you.
In this book, there are three main sections through which you'll learn about the causes of the crisis, things that are being done right now to fix the crisis, and what you can be doing right now to better the future. You'll hear stories like...

Students impacted by the bills passed for student loan forgiveness.
The potential corruption of student loan servicers.
Personal stories of political figures such as Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez.
You will love this book if you are genuinely interested in student loan debt, if you want to get out of the crisis, or if you want to bring about change in your communities.

The American Crisis: The Secret Behind Student Loans is a nonfiction book that speaks to high school/college students, parents of students, and people who were or are involved in the crisis who want to look at student loan forgiveness and student debt in a different way.
 
The Book - The American Crisis
The book is written in 3 parts:

Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-2. This section focuses on the past — what happened to lead up to the student loan debt crisis. For example, one specific factor is college endowments.
Part 2 contains chapters 3-8. This part of the book focuses on the present — what is going on right now in terms of this crisis. Among the main topics addressed in the book are the bills and policies that are being put into place right now and how they are affecting people.
Part 3 contains chapter 9. This last section is about the future — what can we be doing to better the future of this crisis. A large part of this section addresses what the public can do without the help of politicians. Some small actions are definitely worth note-taking.

 
What I Need & What You'll Get
This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs of publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:


The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in December 2021.

The Cover Design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)

The Layout Design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).

The Copyediting for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.

The Launch & Promotion Efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this winter.

I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now:

You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish and a handwritten thank-you note.
Your name will appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book (“with Special Thanks to”).
You will receive early access to the Introduction and some excerpts from my book, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback.
You will have the opportunity to be involved in selecting my cover and title.
You will be invited to join my Author Community and get behind-the-scenes sneak peeks into the publishing process.
And much more!

<h3>Story:</h3>
<p>Poetry and science have a long history of collaboration, and as we live through the urgency of climate collapse - this shared project of communication is paramount. I hope to carry a poetic lens into the Arctic landscape as I set sail with fellow artists and scientists around Svalbard in October.</p>
<p>I can’t say what I’ll witness, and I won’t be able to fathom the scale of the Arctic until I arrive. This is a terrain of deep time and accelerating ice loss.</p>
<p>I received an MFA in Creative Writing from the University of New Hampshire, where I was fortunate to study with Charles Simic. <i>Wonder Tissue</i>, my first full-length collection of poems, won the Airlie Press Prize and was short-listed for a Massachusetts Book Award. I’ve written poetry for NASA as part of a select group of artists who were invited to see the James Webb Space Telescope at Goddard Space Center. It has been my personal project to capture the human experience from ecological and cosmological perspectives. The pulse of this project has certainly increased as we witness the literal and figurative storms of climate collapse, with the Arctic Circle as an epicenter.</p>
<p>I'm so grateful for this opportunity to sail around Svalbard with artists and scientists, and I’d like to share the experience with you as best I can. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What You Get:</h3>
<p>All funding will go toward necessities, as sailing off-grid in the High Arctic will require a lot of preparation, especially for an October trip.</p>
<p>Funding will also go to the perks of choosing to back this project. I’d like to capture the sensory experience of the Arctic for you, be it through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instax pictures (subject to the elements, perishable, like ecosystems)</li>
<li>Sound clips (auditory snapshots of the Arctic terrain)</li>
<li>Video clips (attempts to capture Arctic scale and geological time)</li>
<li>Postcards (grounded in place and time)</li>
</ul>
<p>My fundraising goal is more in the service of engaging with as many people as would like to contribute. If you think it would be cool to get a postcard or audio clip from Svalbard, then join in!</p>
<p>Eventually, I hope the Arctic Circle Residency experience evolves into whatever creative incarnation best fits. I am hopeful for poems. I am hopeful for Arctic dreams.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p><i>Important Note</i>: we will be receiving a final go/no-go decision around September 20<sup>th</sup> so I will be prepared to travel when word arrives. The residency will make a final decision based on travel guidelines and the health and safety of the residents. If the trip is deferred, I will gladly refund contributions and hopefully try again the following year.</p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>The Bitcoin Investor</i> is about standing at the intersection of finance and technology and evaluate and comprehend this exciting new asset class built on the top of blockchain technology.<br/><br/>My name is Amit Kaushik, and I am the author of <i>The Bitcoin Investor</i>. I wrote this book because, in my experience of building an Asset Management Company focusing on Cryptocurrencies, I found a significant lack of framework and tools that an investor needs to understand and evaluate this asset class.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover that blockchain is a foundational technology like the Internet. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for studying about and investing in Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, DeFi, and NFTs. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you navigate the complexity of Cryptocurrencies and the inherent risk of investing in this new and volatile asset class.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about how blockchain can give rise to a new economy built around decentralization, similar to how the Internet gave rise to the information economy, and why this is important in understanding the enormous growth potential of this asset class. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>Marc Andreessen, the visionary who built the Netscape browser kicking off the Internet in the 90s.</li>
<li>Mike Novogratz, the bull of Wall Street, bet big on Bitcoin and Ethereum way earlier than anyone else on Wall Street.</li>
<li>Cathy Wood, the innovation hunter, discovered and invested in Bitcoin in 2015 at about $250 per Bitcoin.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you want to learn about blockchain technology in an accessible manner, become familiar with the value drivers of Cryptocurrencies, and make an informed investing decision in this asset class.<br/><br/><i>The Bitcoin Investor</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to institutional and retail investors who want to look at the cryptocurrencies and investing in a new way.</p>

<h3>The Book - The Bitcoin Investor</h3>
<p>The book is written in 4 parts.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains the introduction + chapters 1-4. This section introduces Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies by drawing parallels between the growth of the early Internet and Bitcoin. In this section, you will learn how traditional financial valuation tools do not work with the early growth stages of foundational technologies like the Internet and blockchain.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 5-7. This section delves into the contrasting value drivers behind an old economy company like Blockbuster and a new economy company like Netflix. New economy companies' products often become more valuable as new customers sign up, a phenomenon known in the economics literature as the increasing marginal returns. This phenomenon can explain how new technology like Bitcoin can have unexpected and exponential growth.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters 8-11. In this section, the reader learns that the seeds of modern decentralized money were sown in the early 80s by a group of Computer Scientists known as Cypherpunks. Satoshi Nakamoto’s Bitcoin design, presented in a white paper in 2008, was a culmination of a three-decade-long effort by theoreticians, programmers, and mathematicians. This section introduces the building blocks of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other blockchain protocols. By the end of this section, the reader should understand the history and technology of these protocols.<br/><br/><strong>Part 4</strong> contains chapters 12-14. This section tackles Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies from an investing perspective. A risk-return analysis of the price history is presented. The readers get a front-seat view of how these assets have arrived at their present state. The exceptional returns have come with enormous volatility. The risks inherent in such returns make it important to understand how to include this asset class in a portfolio.</p>

<li>I love Russian literature. My favorite books include ""The Master and Margarita"" by Bulgakov, ""A Hero of Our Time"" by Lermontov, ""Invitation to a Beheading"" by Nabokov... and of course, ""Dead Souls"" by Gogol. What do all these works have in common? They're absolutely brilliant (though incredibly dark) satire. None of this dense, heavy Tolstoy garbage.</li>
<li>
<strong>Who am I?</strong> I'm a fiction writer whose work has appeared in a few magazines. I've won the 35th ""On the Premises"" contest with a story about God and schizophrenia (it's actually satire as well): <a href=""https://onthepremises.com/issues/issue-35/issue-35-place1/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://onthepremises.com/issues/issue-35/issue...</a>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Who am I to write this?</strong> Probably a bit too big-headed for my own good, but I thought I'd add to Gogol's incredible political satire by 1. Translating it into modern American terms and 2. Not needing to do 30+ years of 1840s Russian political life. It'll work don't worry.</li>
<li>
<strong>Why now?</strong> Because we have a major election coming up, and it seems good timing for a political satire. Better to laugh than to cry, right?</li>

<h3>What is ""Dead Souls?"" Who is Gogol, and why isn't his name spelled ""Google?""</h3>
<p>Dead Souls is a political satire about Pavel Ivanovitch Tchitchikov (Chichikov), a small-time bureaucrat running a big-time scam. He goes from mansion to mansion to buy up the names of dead peasants, and with these names, he plans to take out a loan from the Russian government with his ghostly collateral. It is the ultimate bank fraud scheme. I love it.</p>
<p>Gogol intended his ""poem in prose"" to be in three parts. We have the full first part. He wrote the second part and loved it so much, he decided to burn it and let himself be haunted by its imperfections.</p>

<h3><strong>The Story of Steel in the Blood</strong></h3>
<p>Erick is the Executor of the Geneline Ollson, protector of over nine billion of the Empress’s loyal subjects. He has ruled for three centuries and is preparing his daughter to take his place-but that may happen sooner than he hoped. Accused of treason and the target of a looming civil war, he must find the evidence to clear his family name. But in his search, he uncovers a dark secret that threatens the very place of the Empire of Humanity among the stars.<br/><br/>My name is N.T. Narbutovskih and I am the author of Steel in the Blood, the first book in the Reckoning Cycle. I wrote this book because I have always loved the power of science fiction, its ability to reveal truths about our lives and humanity. I wanted to explore a great story in a compelling universe with multifaceted characters, and I think the themes of this story are particularly relevant to our times.<br/><br/>In reading this book, I hope that you will discover what you believe about the nature of humanity and experience a sense of wonder. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to engage with privilege and rights, escape from the struggle of these things in modern life, and learn alongside Erick about the importance of examining why, or even if, you believe what you do.</p>
<h3><strong>The Universe of Steel in the Blood</strong></h3>The Empire of Humanity has stood for two thousand years. All software source code is encrypted to a single human genome. From the diaspora near the end of the twenty-third century, the Empire spanned a thousand suns in only a thousand years. But then, the Mendicant Uprising made the Empress look inward, and in her wisdom, she decided that the machine intelligences were too dangerous. Despite her best efforts, Empress Titania I could not stop the machines as they genocided entire planets. Finally, she found a way to defeat them and brought stability and peace back to the Empire. For a thousand more years, the Executors built the trade schedules, kept the peace, and the Empire grew wealthy and prospered.<br/><br/>Erick of Ollson has ruled for nearly three hundred years. He has kept the schedules, the factories have run on time, and his people have been safe from the raids of the Others, despite their place on the periphery. He is normally cool-headed and calm, with iron self-control under external stress. He is an adept statesman, knows the rules of the game and where the power is to be found in the seams not filled by the Empress.<br/><br/>His daughter, Bryn, is learning quickly and is proving to be as ruthless in politics as she is in the dojo. She is fiercely loyal to the Ollson Geneline and values her advisors and staff as if they were family. She accompanies Erick to all official Geneline functions as a matter of course. Still, She would go regardless-she has more than a passing interest in Azita, the heir to the Exectorship of Osman.<br/><br/>There has been peace for a millennium, with the Empire running in perfect harmony. The periphery Genelines mine the giant stars. The materials are transformed into goods, luxuries, and necessities, the wealth flowing into the Throneworld-Earth, a planet kept for the Empress alone. But no peace lasts forever.<br/><br/>Erick and his daughter are accused of high treason, breaking the peace, destroying the Empress’s property, and attacking a rival Geneline. Erick has only a few years to prepare before his enemy’s ships appear and plunge him into all-out war. But he believes in the Empire-he knows he can find the proof that will clear his name and present it to the Empress. She will restore his status and his systems. Bryn loves her father but thinks him old and set in his ways. There will be a war, and she will be ready.<br/> <h3><strong>Who’s this for, anyway?</strong></h3> For fans of Dune, The Expanse, and Three-Body Problem, this book is for you! You will love this book if you like grand, sweeping tales, adventure, action, romance, and mystery. Intrigue and politics? Yep. Old and dark secrets? Check. And if you like characters with many dimensions, who discover new ones and face uncomfortable truths... Well, you’ll be right at home!<br/><br/>Steel in the Blood speaks to fans of military science fiction and space opera who want to grapple with the question of right and wrong across a wide range of situations-all through a fast-paced and riveting adventure.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Steel in the Blood inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:<p>What is the nature of loyalty?</p>
<p>Why do you think what you think you think?</p>
<p>Is it better to have stability or freedom?</p> I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers!<br/> <h3><strong>What We Need &amp; What You'll Get</strong></h3> This book will be published with New Degree Press. I set up the pre-order tiers to help cover the costs of publishing my book. Money raised will go towards the following:<p>The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in December 2021.</p>

<p>The Layout Design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).</p>

<h3><strong>About the Author</strong></h3>Nicholas T. Narbutovskih is a military pilot with the United States Air Force. He has served for fourteen years and deployed nine times. He is an avid consumer of science fiction and read Larry Niven’s “Ringworld” at the arguably early age of nine. Ever since, he has been fascinated by the genre’s ability to reveal deep truths through story and metaphor and predict what is probable and possible.<br/><br/>He wrote this book for many reasons. It began as an idle thought experiment into what a stable interstellar empire might look like based on what we know now and how exactly that might come to pass. But the characters, the implications of AI and our use of it, indeed even the stability-instability of a have and have-not system, it all took on a life of its own.<br/><br/>Outside of writing and flying, he is an avid reader and goes through an average of three books a week. He is an involuntarily experienced home-improvement aficionado and randomly bounces between the hobbies of 3-d printing, woodworking, hiking, ultramarathon, triathlon, painting, and skiing (location dependent!).<br/><br/>For more information, you can connect with Nick at nick@narbutov.com and Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.<br/> <h3>International Preorders</h3> For international preorders, please do the following:<p>Identify the perk that interests you, e.g., 1 or 2 paperbacks</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> The biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you.

You will know when the copies are expected to ship.<br/> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> Not everyone can support, but that doesn't mean you can't get something out of it!<br/>I will reward the top 3 people who refer the most backers at the end of the campaign (30 days).

I wrote this book because of my passion for the characters and my wish to share their story with the world. </p><p>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will find the story as inspiring and uplifting as I do. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to learn alongside the characters about the importance of freedom, wisdom, and gratitude amid difficult circumstances.</p><p>You will love this book if you enjoy fantasy, stories with a touch of spirituality, and a thoughtful depiction of political discourse.</p><p><br/><u><strong>The Bell Tolling</strong></u></p><p>The Blood-soaked Sorcerer tyrannizes the land of Icilia with every form of cruelty imaginable, dying his armor red in the blood of innocents. Crushed to pieces under such savagery, the people of Icilia abandon hope and begin to forget the gifts of civilization that had once been their dearest blessings.<br/><br/>Amid this darkness comes light in the form of Lucian aj-Shehathar, the divinely appointed hero of Icilia, and Leader of the Quest of Freedom. Sheltered by love and educated in every ancient art, Lucian has the virtue, magic, and power necessary to cleanse evil from the land. But not alone, for Icilia is vast and the enemy’s claws have penetrated far beyond the surface.<br/>Answering the call of his sacred destiny, Lucian gathers four companions: Malika, Elian, Arista, and Kyros. Each has been forced to drink at the Blood’s well of suffering:<br/><br/>Malika, once crown princess, has spent years in the tyrant’s prisons and years more fleeing from his grasp. Elian cowers, tormented and alone, amid the remains of the long-ago murder of his parents at the Blood’s hand. Arista fears exploitation of the worst sort as she watches the Blood and his governors prey upon her family, the once mighty warrior princesses of the desert.

I wrote this book because of my passion for the characters and my wish to share their story with the world. My hope is that, in reading this book, you will find the story as inspiring and uplifting as I do. I want you to see this book as an opportunity to learn alongside the characters about the importance of freedom, wisdom, and gratitude amid difficult circumstances.You will love this book if you enjoy fantasy, stories with a touch of spirituality, and a thoughtful depiction of political discourse.The Bell TollingThe Blood-soaked Sorcerer tyrannizes the land of Icilia with every form of cruelty imaginable, dying his armor red in the blood of innocents. Crushed to pieces under such savagery, the people of Icilia abandon hope and begin to forget the gifts of civilization that had once been their dearest blessings.Amid this darkness comes light in the form of Lucian aj-Shehathar, the divinely appointed hero of Icilia, and Leader of the Quest of Freedom. Sheltered by love and educated in every ancient art, Lucian has the virtue, magic, and power necessary to cleanse evil from the land. But not alone, for Icilia is vast and the enemy’s claws have penetrated far beyond the surface.Answering the call of his sacred destiny, Lucian gathers four companions: Malika, Elian, Arista, and Kyros. Each has been forced to drink at the Blood’s well of suffering:Malika, once crown princess, has spent years in the tyrant’s prisons and years more fleeing from his grasp. Elian cowers, tormented and alone, amid the remains of the long-ago murder of his parents at the Blood’s hand. Arista fears exploitation of the worst sort as she watches the Blood and his governors prey upon her family, the once mighty warrior princesses of the desert. Kyros gives everything to protect his sister from the abuse of his village in the years after the Blood’s massacre of his family.Tortured, alone, broken—they are hardly the stuff of heroes. But Lucian chooses them, trusting in divine choice and in his own ability to protect them and build their confidence. With his four companions at his side, Lucian embarks on his journey to free his world. He is determined to restore the forgotten laws, heal the tormented, and unite the land behind his banner. But his companions seem too shattered to save anyone, while his people might be too blind to see the light... The Bell Tolling speaks to readers of epic fantasy and political intrigue who want to grapple with political leadership and ethics in a new way.Ultimately, I hope The Bell Tolling inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:
What is the true meaning of freedom?
What does empowerment look like?
How is hope born amid desperate circumstances?
How does the ideal political leader act? How does he treat those who differ from him in appearance and beliefs?
I look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers. I believe discussing political leadership, empowerment, and spirituality will change us all for the better. The Book ItselfThe book is written in 4 parts.Part 1 contains the author’s note, the Preface, the Promise, and Chapters 1-14.

<h3>The Background</h3>
<p><strong>In 2011, after three long years, I completed a novel, 'The Unbearable Stupidity Of Being', and began searching for a publisher. With the characters very much alive in my head, I immediately threw myself into a second, 'Six Degrees Of Stupidity'. Eighteen months later it was finished – just in time for me to become massively distracted by the campaign for Scottish independence and the looming 2014 referendum.</strong></p>
<p>My contribution to that campaign was to take all the absurdity, satire and fantasy I'd developed in those books and adapt it to political comic strip form in order to bring some much-needed humour and colour to the debate. I've created a weekly cartoon ever since.</p>
<p>And the books? Well, at the height of lockdown in 2020 I took another look and was delighted to find that not only were they as much fun as I remembered, they were also something I could be proud of. Six Degrees was slightly more polished and fresher in my mind than its predecessor, so I began the lengthy editing and rewriting process that's taken until now to complete.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p><i>Underemployed graphic designer Tony Boaks creates a coat of arms for Guy LeSnide, a QC (‘like a lawyer, but even more so’) with monumental delusions of grandeur. Before settling his bill however, LeSnide’s delusions turn to madness and he retreats to the fictional English region of Wester – a dense and murky area only accessible by canal.</i></p>
<p><i>Unwilling to let madness be an excuse for non-payment, Tony sets out on an epic quest to track him down, narrowboating into Wester’s heart of darkness and taking the spikey unrequited love of his life, LaFlamme, along for the ride.</i></p>
<p><i>Encounters with a psychotic ventriloquist dummy, a deviant gastrophile and a professional beard-reader are just some of the weirdnesses to expect in this delightfully quirky satire set in a fantastical comic universe.</i></p>
<h3>The Funding</h3>
<p>It's taken years to produce this book. As well as being the writer, I'm also the publisher, editor, typesetter and cover designer. But I'm not asking you to fund that time.</p>
<p>What I'm asking for is the cost of printing and the materials needed to create the additional perks, along with a modest wage to continue the weekly cartoon (which has been mostly without funding since I was released from The National at the start of lockdown) for a few more months. I still believe independence is just around the corner, and this is no time to quit making fun of politicians. (See <a href=""https://gregmoodie.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">gregmoodie.com</a>)</p>
<h3>The Perks</h3>
<p>In return, you can expect a signed first edition copy of the 232-page paperback book (197mm x 132mm, approximately 8"" x 5""), printed in Scotland by Bell &amp; Bain Ltd. Additional perks include T-shirts, hand painted prints and full-size screenprinted acrylic painted canvases, all based on my front cover design. (See images above and click on the individual perks on the right for details.)</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>According to the publisher of my 2018 book 'Cool Scots', satire is a rare breed in Scottish literature. It may be that some books never see the light of day or get the attention they deserve due to the ongoing difficulty artists face trying to fund their work. Your support is vital. Every contribution will help bring this odd little gem to life and show that Scotland can produce genuinely funny satirical fiction.</p>

<h2>Story of My Book</h2>
<p><i>Leading Blind without Vision: The Struggles of Visually Impaired and Blind Individuals that Lead to Their Success</i> is a book about the struggles that people who are blind and visually impaired go through when trying to find and maintain employment. This book will educate the business community on the benefits and value of hiring this population.<br/><br/>My name is Welby Broaddus and I am the author of <i>Leading Blind without Vision: The Struggles of Visually Impaired and Blind Individuals that Lead to Their Success</i>. I wrote this book because I want to tell my story about the struggles and discrimination I faced as a visually impaired individual looking for employment. I also want to lead the charge to inspire a new outlook on hiring the visually impaired, and educate HR professionals, business executives, and business owners on the opportunities of employing those in this talented group of people.<br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book you will discover the value, skill set, and untapped talent that employers will gain by hiring people who are blind and visually impaired. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for recognizing talents and value within others. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you understand the benefits of employing people who are blind and visually impaired.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the Americans with Disabilities Act's guidelines when employing individuals who are blind and visually impaired and how to accommodate this population in the workplace. You'll learn about...</p>
<ul>
<li>The science behind visual impairment- how the brain rewires the senses of people who are blind and visually impaired</li>
<li>Examples of discrimination - such as how one professor was discriminated against during an interview.</li>
<li>Critical thinking skills - how people who are blind and visually impaired are natural problem solvers, as they need to problem solve every day to navigate through a sighted world.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you want to learn more about the benefits of employing people who are blind and visually impaired, if you are hoping to learn how to accommodate an employee who is blind and visually impaired, or if you want to learn how to include employees who are blind and visually impaired into the company’s diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.<br/><br/><i>Leading Blind without Vision: The Struggles of Visually Impaired and Blind Individuals that Lead to Success</i> is a nonfiction book that speaks to business owners, executives, and HR professionals who want to explore the unique qualities and the benefits of hiring people who are blind and visually impaired in a new way.<br/> </p>
<h3>The Book - Leading Blind without Vision: The Struggles of Visually Impaired and Blind Individuals that Lead to Success</h3>
<p><br/><br/>The book is written into 3 parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1, 2, and 3. This section of the book addresses the history of discrimination against people who are blind and visually impaired. You will hear about the unfortunate story of doctor Dr. Mona Minkara who goes to interview at a university, and is subjected to many inappropriate questions during their interview.<br/>Readers will also learn about human senses. You will discover how the brain redirects the senses of a person who is blind and visually impaired to compensate for their vision loss. Lastly, this section covers accessibility technology, and some of the tools that allow this population to perform any job that they are in which they are qualified.<br/><br/>Part 2 contains chapters 4,5,6,7,8, and 9. This section talks about the skills that people who are blind and visually impaired use on a daily basis to move around a sighted world that employers want in their employees. Readers will hear a story about how a blind chef prepares his day to make sure that he is at work on time, and how he stays after to make sure his delivery is placed in its proper place that he will be able to locate it when he needs it.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains chapters 10, 11, 12, 13, and the appendix. This section identifies ways that business owners, executives, and HR professionals can further educate themselves to learn more about the positive asset that people who are blind and visually impaired can bring to their businesses. In this section, Meg O’Connell, Founder and CEO of Global Disability Inclusion, describes what a well-thought-out diversity, equity, and inclusion program looks like.<br/> </p>

Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you understand the benefits of employing people who are blind and visually impaired.In this book, you'll learn about the Americans with Disabilities Act's guidelines when employing individuals who are blind and visually impaired and how to accommodate this population in the workplace. You'll learn about...

The science behind visual impairment- how the brain rewires the senses of people who are blind and visually impaired
Examples of discrimination - such as how one professor was discriminated against during an interview.
Critical thinking skills - how people who are blind and visually impaired are natural problem solvers, as they need to problem solve every day to navigate through a sighted world.

You will love this book if you want to learn more about the benefits of employing people who are blind and visually impaired, if you are hoping to learn how to accommodate an employee who is blind and visually impaired, or if you want to learn how to include employees who are blind and visually impaired into the company’s diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.Leading Blind without Vision: The Struggles of Visually Impaired and Blind Individuals that Lead to Success is a nonfiction book that speaks to business owners, executives, and HR professionals who want to explore the unique qualities and the benefits of hiring people who are blind and visually impaired in a new way. 
The Book - Leading Blind without Vision: The Struggles of Visually Impaired and Blind Individuals that Lead to Success
The book is written into 3 parts.Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1, 2, and 3. This section of the book addresses the history of discrimination against people who are blind and visually impaired. You will hear about the unfortunate story of doctor Dr. Mona Minkara who goes to interview at a university, and is subjected to many inappropriate questions during their interview.Readers will also learn about human senses. You will discover how the brain redirects the senses of a person who is blind and visually impaired to compensate for their vision loss. Lastly, this section covers accessibility technology, and some of the tools that allow this population to perform any job that they are in which they are qualified.Part 2 contains chapters 4,5,6,7,8, and 9. This section talks about the skills that people who are blind and visually impaired use on a daily basis to move around a sighted world that employers want in their employees. Readers will hear a story about how a blind chef prepares his day to make sure that he is at work on time, and how he stays after to make sure his delivery is placed in its proper place that he will be able to locate it when he needs it.Part 3 contains chapters 10, 11, 12, 13, and the appendix. This section identifies ways that business owners, executives, and HR professionals can further educate themselves to learn more about the positive asset that people who are blind and visually impaired can bring to their businesses. In this section, Meg O’Connell, Founder and CEO of Global Disability Inclusion, describes what a well-thought-out diversity, equity, and inclusion program looks like.

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>The curse of democracy is that voting is the only agent of change. But figuring out what's happening in American politics in the midst of constant media exposure and disinformation is exhausting. Instead of succumbing to this disease of attrition, Ballot Boxing explores the trends that shape the political landscape we face today and proves that everyday Americans have the ultimate control over our democracy.<br/><br/>My name is Lucy Santora and I am the author of Ballot Boxing. I wrote this book because of my own roadblocks in voting in the 2020 election and frustration with the partisan coverage of voting rights in the media. I wanted to create something that took the political posturing and heady verbiage out of the equation and focus on reality.  <br/><br/>In reading this book, you will discover how heavily our current political landscape can be influenced by the everyday American--including you. I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for American democracy. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you take charge of your community and wield power through voting.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about how we got to this point and what we can do now that we're here. You'll hear stories such as...<ul>
<li>How Madison Cawthorn went from a college dropout to the youngest congressman and sweetheart of the Republican party;</li>
<li>Why “The Squad” is not some woke phenomenon but actually a domino effect of local groups getting out the vote; and</li>
<li>How your local political sphere is the laboratory for new legislation and new politicians, making local elections even more important for the future of our country </li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are proud to be American, want a non-partisan breakdown of our political landscape, or survived the 2020 election cycle and feel exhausted by the media.  <br/><br/>Ballot Boxing is a nonfiction book that speaks to everyday Americans regardless of political party who want to look at voting and democracy in a new way.</p>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Beyond Honey</i> is a book about honey bees and their impact on our society, including stories about economic, entrepreneurial, and environmental impact. These stories show how these tiny creatures affect our lives for the good. I also share about the benefits and challenges of our interconnected world, specifically the relationship between humans and the environment. <br/><br/>My name is Tierney Monahan and I am the author of <i>Beyond Honey</i>. I'm a beekeeper myself and I've read a lot of books that were manuals, how-tos, and books about bee biology. These books detailed honey bees themselves rather than how honey bees can and do play a role in revitalizing communities, offering alternative income possibilities, and providing hive products that can be used for medicinal purposes.<br/><br/>We have a certain idea about bees, right? They’re either scary and to be feared, or simply the producer of honey, a product that we consume. Of course, honey is amazing and we should appreciate it, but, even beyond that, we miss the core lesson and core truth: we need honey bees for our survival as humans, primarily due to their pollination services which pollinate about one-third of our food source. <br/><br/>I wanted to share inspiring stories about people who are making incredible differences in the lives of diverse populations through beekeeping opportunities. These populations include the incarcerated, formerly incarcerated, former miners, veterans, first responders, urban dwellers, and rural farmers. They are benefiting from training opportunities with honey bees to revitalize their economies, explore new methods of financial stability, or to simply reconnect with nature.<br/><br/>My hope for this book is that I can debunk the myth that honey bees are dangerous and really show that not only are they not as aggressive as people imagine them to be, but also that the impact goes beyond the commercial product of honey that we buy. I aim to prove there is value in working with your hands, working with nature, and working with community. A lot of personal growth and personal reflection happens during beekeeping due to the methodical nature of it. It's very meditative and therapeutic. I hope that this book can highlight stories of people who have collaborated with bees to impact their lives for the better.<br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about the economic, entrepreneurial, and environmental impacts of honey bees. Learn from a number of amazing individuals and organizations on why honey bees are important, what they can teach us, and what lessons we can learn from them. Here are just three stories (of many!) that are shared in the book:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><a href=""https://www.missionbeelieve.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Mission Beelieve</a></strong> (MD): An organization that provides beekeeping training to veterans and first responders. They created the foundation with hands-on workshops and seminars, to help veterans begin to feel some peace, learn a new trade, and connect with the community while embracing the therapeutic and vocational aspects of beekeeping.</li>
<li>
<strong><a href=""http://sustainabilityinprisons.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Sustainability in Prisons Project</a></strong> (WA): An organization that partners with the Washington State Department of Corrections to empower sustainable change by bringing nature, science, and environmental education into prisons.</li>
<li>
<a href=""https://www.utmtsociety.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><strong>Under the Mango Tree Society</strong></a> (India): An organization that works with smallholder farmers in tribal communities on beekeeping with indigenous bees. This leads to conservation of the keystone species of local honey bees, and increases yields and incomes for farming communities through better pollination and diversifying livelihoods.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>All three of these projects train diverse populations in the art and science of beekeeping. It opens a pathway for them, to work on their personal growth and connection with others, and for some, improve their economic situation through alternative income sources. It allows people to focus on something positive and productive, and perhaps even find a deeper meaning to their lives.<br/><br/>You'll love this book if you are interested in: the environment, understanding where your food comes from, the connection between animals and humans, and exploring the need we have for connection.<br/> </p>
<h3>The Book - Beyond Honey</h3>The book is written in four parts, with an introduction and conclusion.<br/><br/><strong>Part 1</strong> contains chapters 1-2 about how human survival is linked to bee survival and how bees can be our teachers. I touch on the need for connection and a framework for rethinking our relationship with bees.<br/><br/><strong>Part 2</strong> contains chapters 4-6 about economic impact. In this section, there are stories about incarcerated students who are contributing to science and cultivating positive self-image through beekeeping. I also share about overcoming trauma and the need for community in healing, especially as it relates to veterans and first responders.<br/><br/><strong>Part 3</strong> contains chapters 7-9 about entrepreneurial impact. In this section, there are stories about revitalizing communities through beekeeping efforts, as well as a discussion on the medicinal qualities of hive products.<br/><br/><strong>Part 4</strong> contains chapters 10-11 about environmental impact. In this section, the focus is on how human involvement affects bees, climate change, and pollination services.<br/> <h3>What I Need &amp; What You'll Receive</h3>

<h3>Who I Am</h3>
<p>I was appointed as Lake County, CA's eleventh Poet Laureate in March of this year and will serve two years in this role. I was elated when I found out I was chosen as the next poet laureate of my home county, an accomplishment I am most proud of and an honor I wholeheartedly respect. I had been a finalist for the 2018-2020 term and spent two years since building momentum in the literary community of Lake County via events, readings, and networking. Only days later after the great news that I was selected as our new poet laureate, the COVID-19 pandemic began to impact our community as officials began closing businesses and ordering our current shelter in place. Now at the end of November 2020 there is no sight of the end of this pandemic just yet. </p>
<p>Despite the pandemic, after announcing my laureateship on social media I received such loving and encouraging messages from friends, family, and writers expressing their faith in my leadership in an uncertain time. Yes, we need to stay physically distant from one another to protect our most vulnerable fellow humans and ourselves but that’s not to say we can’t remain close and connected through our creativity. So I took action right away in my new role, creating virtual readings, open mics, workshops, and promoting my literary community on social media.  </p>
<p>So far, I've created a poetry column in collaboration with the Lake County Bloom, a bi-weekly writers circle with the Lake County Arts Council, a farmers’ market poetry contest with Lake County Farmers’ Finest, a radio show with KPFZ 88.1 FM, and organized and hosted a number of readings and workshop including a reading for the LGBTQ+ community, a reading to raise awareness of  immigrants in detention centers, a rain-themed reading to manifest rain after wildfires; workshops on the topics of writing and self-doubt or reframing trauma, and much more. Since all events are virtual during this time, I am also able to invite guests from other counties, even other states, which brings awareness to others of our rural county and offers a wide array of creative exposure to our locals who may otherwise not be able to experience. </p>
<p>Lake County is fortunate to have a rich, diverse literary community of writers from all backgrounds and experience, genres and styles; from poetry to fiction, non-fiction to memoir and I aim to continue the momentum of cultivating a literary community of inclusivity and diversity by offering and sharing a variety of virtual writing events during COVID-19. Poetry brings us together in the human experience, even in isolation, even in loneliness. There is a sense of resilience and continuity that can be found as a writer if you keep at it and keep working the muscles of memory, of expression, of sharing in supportive spaces. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Why I am Asking for Funding</h3>
<p>Which brings me to this ask: the Poet Laureate program in Lake County is entirely volunteer based and is not financially supported by any entities or organizations and is not financially supported by the county.  I am in the process of applying for various grants but in the meantime, I continue to do all of my planning and events on an unpaid basis and occasionally, I may pay out of pocket to fund contests, writers, etc. So I am opening this up to my local community and communities beyond to contribute any dollar amount to provide funds that will support my work and my ability to pay local writers to co-facilitate workshops or be featured readers at special events! This funding would especially support local writers in this community during the pandemic. Any amount will make a difference. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">What Your Monetary Contribution Will Do</span></h3>
<p><font><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;"">My goal is to raise $1000 and to be completely transparent about how that amount is raised and how it is used. My vision is to be able to support writers in their interests of facilitating writing workshops by being able to pay them for their time, when hosting special readings, I'd love to be able to pay each reader for their time and work, and I'd love to pay a local resident who crafts poetry boxes to be able to put up more in different towns around the lake. As writers, we don't often get paid for what we do and we do it because we absolutely love it but it is nice to be recognized in such a way. </span></font><font><span style=""font-size: 16px;font-weight: 500;"">Any dollar amount you donate will be used to fund all of the above.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>You are sitting in a director’s chair. Or you are in the middle of a scene. Or you are editing footage. But how did you get there? How do you get into the entertainment industry especially if you have no connections? How do up and coming people of color find opportunities in entertainment? All these questions are answered in a book.<br/><br/>My name is Mallika Chennupaty and I am the author of <i>Greenlight: Breaking into Entertainment</i>. I wrote this book because I am deeply interested in joining the entertainment industry, but I don’t know anyone in the industry and I don’t know what I want to do. Furthermore, as a woman of color, there are unique challenges that the industry presents. <br/><br/><br/>My hope for writing this book is two-fold. First, I hope to find the confidence to pursue a career in the entertainment industry. Second, I hope that you unearth the information and self-belief to pursue different paths in entertainment. I am part of the audience that I am writing for: people of color interested in entertainment. I hope this book will be a personal guide to breaking into the entertainment industry as much for you as it has been for me. <br/><br/>I want you to see this book as an opportunity to overcome the fear of stepping outside of your comfort zone, and as a collection of stories/memories/advice for creatives of color from all walks of the industry, including acting, writing, directing and even entertainment reporting. <br/><br/><br/>Greenlight speaks to people interested in pursuing a career in the entertainment industry and anyone who loves hearing stories of others who want to grapple with joining a network-based industry with no connections and being a creative of color in a white-dominated industry in a new way.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that Greenlight inspires reflection and drives change, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>How can you use your self-belief to overcome challenges and follow an unconventional path?</li>
<li>How can you tap into your creativity to tell meaningful stories?</li>
<li>How has the recent shift towards diversity of all sorts in Hollywood reflected in the careers of creatives of color? </li>
<li>How can we uplift and energize creatives of color in an industry where connections pave the way?</li>
</ul>
<p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with all of you, my peers and community!</p>

Over the summer, she is working at Microsoft as a Program Manager Intern while also writing for two magazines, Pulse Spikes and Grain of Salt.

<h3><strong>Meet <i>The Doctor</i></strong></h3>
<p>What pushes your inner darkness?<br/>Do we all have an alter ego who will defend us against the evil in this world?<br/>How far will we go to defend those we love?<br/><br/>My name is Sally Barrilla and I am the author of <i>The Doctor</i>. I wrote this book at first as a personal reflection on myself since, as a victim of bullying, I have always wondered if there was an alter ego of myself who knew how to defend herself from the start. Someone who looked exactly like me but was a total and absolute badass.<br/><br/>As a proud daughter and granddaughter of Spanish-speaking Ecuadorian immigrants, my dream was to bring forth creativity and imagination once my teachers presented me with essays, novels, short stories, and much more. There is so much potential that is brought forth by words.<br/><br/><i>The Doctor</i> is the epic story of a fearless private detective who utilizes passion and determination in her journey to seek revenge against a ruthless doctor and regain some form of peace.<br/><br/>This novel is a psychological thriller full of suspense, mystery, and guaranteed to give you goosebumps. The setting takes place in suburban North Carolina, a town full of sunshine with barely any rain. Our protagonist is Sasha, a bisexual woman who suffered harsh tragedies and was forced to undergo the worst disaster of her life. Her companions are Naomi and Max, two individuals who share similar goals as Sasha: to seek the ultimate revenge. The antagonist is Dr. Jonathan Morgan whose desire to harm innocent children immediately makes him Sasha’s target.<br/><br/>You will love this book if you love thrillers taken up a notch, intense suspense and drama, and mystery that shakes you to your core.<br/><br/>The Doctor speaks to young adults and thriller and horror fanatics who want to grapple with embracing one’s inner darkness and choosing between one’s heart, sadness, or anger to discover if vengeance is worth it or not.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I hope that <i>The Doctor</i> inspires reflection and fruitful dialogue, pressing into engaging questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do our alter egos have a good or bad side? Do we ourselves have those? Which one is more powerful, weaker than the other, or are they equally the same?</li>
<li>During our most vulnerable moments, which emotion is stronger: revenge or moving on? If revenge has the potential to push out our inner darkness then does moving on have the power to keep it inside?</li>
<li>Does every human being have an alter ego? Do we simply have the versions we know, born and raised?</li>
</ul>
<p>I really look forward to exploring these questions and beyond with my readers!</p>

<h3><strong>The Story of The Wildlife Divas Adventure Team</strong></h3>
<p><strong>When encountering a six-hundred pound Silverback Gorilla in the rainforest, you must remember rule number one:<i> Don't RUN!!</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627064542/tl4ewrtnaey2bwf28ljr.png"" src=""""/></i></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is <strong>Lisa M. Randolph</strong>, the author of the children's book,<i> <strong>The Wildlife Divas Adventure Team: Saving Endangered Mountain Gorillas</strong>. </i>The idea of this book came from a decades' long journey from my work with some of the most marginalized, at-risk members of American society, <i>Black Girls.</i>  I could not have foreseen the importance and impact this book would have at this pivotal moment in our country. The timing, impeccable. </p>
<p>I've written this book for several reasons:</p>
<p><strong>LACK OF DIVERSITY</strong>. Representation matters.  Children of color, <strong>African-American girls</strong> specifically, from inner-city neighborhoods, cannot readily find themselves represented on the pages of most children's book. My characters, all African-American, are as never seen before, traveling the seven continents of the world, bringing attention to the plight of critically endangered species and conservation efforts to save them.</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: A book about an animal is eight times more likely to be written than a book about a<i> child of color</i> as the main character. (African, Asian, Hispanic, Indigenous, Pacific Islander)</p>
<p><strong>STEM/STEAM</strong>. The importance of minorities entering into the realm of <i>Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math</i>, cannot be understated. In the near future, the fastest growing segment of the workforce in the  21st century are STEAM related jobs. The future begins now!</p>
<p><strong>FACT</strong>: Only 2.9% of Black Women earn degrees across STEM/STEAM fields. </p>
<p>In my children's book, each member of The Wildlife Divas Adventure Team possesses an element of STEAM.  I feel it necessary and of great importance for Black Girls to see themselves in emotionally healthy, positive roles, in the great outdoors, saving the planet. Preparing, motivating and directing girls to train for high-demand jobs in STEAM fields by example, in the hopes it provides them the freedom to open doors of new opportunities and  careers choices in non-traditional.   By educating a young girl of color, it will uplift her out of poverty and future generations of her family.</p>
<p> </p>

<h3><strong>Mountain Gorillas in the Wild</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Importance of Wildlife Conservation and Endangered Species</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1627064774/ptw9xd8qcntiusk9ux7s.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong><i>Mountain Gorillas, Bwindi Impenetrable National Park, Uganda</i></strong></p>
<p>According to the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature)  Red List of the top 10 most endangered animals on the planet, Mountain Gorillas rank number three on the list.  These majestic beasts, sharing 95-99% DNA with their closest relatives (humans)  live in only three African nations, Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda and Uganda. There are a total of 1004 mountain gorilla left on the entire planet.   Conservation efforts have been stepped up by organizations such as <i>The Gorillas Doctors, The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund</i> and most recently, <i>The Ellen Fund.</i></p>
<p>One of many purposes for <i>The Wildlife Divas Adventure Team</i> children's book (series), is to bring attention to the plight of critically endangered animals, sparking an interest and curiosity in the minds and imagination children from inner-city neighborhoods, unaware of such issues taking place in the world.  My hope is by reading this book and future books in the series, it may spark an interest in non-traditional career choices, such as Conversation, Ecology, Wildlife Sciences, and Zoology, just to name a few. </p>
<p>In addition to STEAM and Wildlife Conservation, the book also includes facts about the country in which they visit, and explores culture, food, music and language, in an excitement filled adventure, with lots of laughs and humor. </p>

One of many purposes for The Wildlife Divas Adventure Team children's book (series), is to bring attention to the plight of critically endangered animals, sparking an interest and curiosity in the minds and imagination children from inner-city neighborhoods, unaware of such issues taking place in the world.  My hope is by reading this book and future books in the series, it may spark an interest in non-traditional career choices, such as Conversation, Ecology, Wildlife Sciences, and Zoology, just to name a few. 
In addition to STEAM and Wildlife Conservation, the book also includes facts about the country in which they visit, and explores culture, food, music and language, in an excitement filled adventure, with lots of laughs and humor.

Risks & Challenges
My biggest challenge with publishing this book has been the death of my husband three weeks ago.  Living in a dual state of emotions, both joy and grief has not been easy. The excitement of my first major publishing accomplishment and delivering the finished book to my backers, has kept me focused. Delivering your books is of the greatest importance to me. 
I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.To add, the risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up to date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies of my book you pre-ordered are expected to ship.

<p><strong><i>Daddy, Tell Me a Story</i></strong> is a book about <strong>purpose</strong>, <strong>legacy</strong>, <strong>leadership</strong> and <strong>community</strong>. In it I share some of the pivotal moments of my father's life and career while sharing insightful life lessons.  After publishing costs, the proceeds from this campaign will be used to support the educational pursuits of students attending Savannah State University (SSU) and Southern University Law Center (SULC) through our family's foundation, <strong>JMN C.A.R.E.S</strong>.</p>
<p>Hi! I am Attorney Nefertara Clark, the author of <strong><i>Daddy, Tell Me a Story.</i></strong>  I am an alumnae of Savannah State University and Southern University Law Center, and so is my father. Fun fact, my mother also attended SSU. That's where she met my father. But, more about that in the book. :-) That's how we arrived at supporting scholars of these illustrious institutions. I wrote this book as a means to share my father's life and legacy while also continuing my parents' legacy of supporting scholars. </p>
<p>The journey of writing the first draft of my manuscript was much more daunting than I expected. You see, I write 40,000 word appellate briefs for clients I've only known for a few months. So, I figured it would be extremely easy to write a 40,000 word book about a man I've known and adored my entire life. That wasn't the case. But, by the grace of God, I have completed my manuscript. </p>
<p>You will laugh, cry and think deeply about the stories you’ll read. You will love this book if you like an interesting story about those who have had unique life experiences. In this book, you should expect to read stories about:</p>
<ul>
<li>My father's decision to stop consuming alcohol,</li>
<li>The threat on his life as a result of courtroom victories for people of color seeking elected office and city jobs, and </li>
<li>His lifelong belief in God and his ability to see the bigger picture. </li>
</ul>
<p>I  believe in God, purpose, community and legacy. In reading this book, it is my prayer that this book will encourage and edify others as they intentionally pursue their purpose. </p>
<p>Please watch my promotional video above and choose your level of support (perk). </p>

<p>Because of academic scholarships, I was fortunate enough to leave not only undergrad, but also  law school without any student loans to interrupt my post graduation financial endeavors.

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>Hi! My name is Jennifer Juvenelle and I'd like to share my story with you. This novel is more than four years in the making, and it's my greatest accomplishment to date. I began writing in the summer of 2016 without knowing or understanding how the life and tribulations of Sophie Greer would shape my life. Now, after all the writing (and rewriting) I'm ready to share the life-altering and sometimes shattering, tale of Sophie Greer in this epic first book of what will become the <strong>Daughter of Belial </strong>series. </p>
<p>Given the expanding nature of the publishing industry, I've decided to self-publish, and now that my book is ready to launch, I plan to ensure it succeeds. This is why I'm running this campaign. Your generous contribution will play a vital role in helping <i>Daughter of Belial </i>reach a bigger audience. To do that, I must hire a professional editor, book designer, book marketer, as well as a distribution company, and run ads prior to and during the launch.</p>
<p>With your support and a lot of hard work, I'm confident this book will make self-publishing history!</p>
<p>Why am I so confident? Because I believe in the story. </p>
<p>Here's a quick blurb to let you in on the action: </p>
<p><i>Sophie Greer, a young consultant for a major mergers and acquisitions firm, wakes up hungover and dumped thinking her worst problem is catching her boyfriend cheating the day before. But things soon go from bad to worse when she's pulled into a complex family drama involving her billionaire boss, Edward Hughes, and his brutish half-brother, Wyatt McGregor. Betrayed by the man who raised her, and mysteriously targeted by the illustrious Hughes family, dark revelations propel Sophie down a wormhole so sinister and vast she may never find her way out. </i></p>
<p><i>Will she discover her true power and save herself, or be crushed beneath the weight of the all-powerful secret Order of Belial? One thing is certain—family history can be deadly.</i></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Looking for reader feedback?</strong> One peer reviewer had this to say: </p>
<p>""In this, her debut novel, Jennifer writes so extraordinarily and exceptionally well, you will surely be taken on a wildly fascinating, and simultaneously horrifying thrill ride. Fasten your seat belt – once you go down this rabbit hole, you will not come back the same. This book is a truly captivating, provocative read.""</p>
<p><strong>Want more?</strong> The most common comparisons from early reader responses that I've received for my writing have been to Gillian Flynn (<i>Gone Girl</i>) and Dan Brown (<i>The </i><i>Da Vinci Code</i>). I'm humbled by their replies and while this story is definitely its own original saga, I'd be honored to stand amongst those bestselling behemoths. </p>
<p> </p>

<h3>Why Your Contribution Matters</h3>
<p>Breaking into the traditional publishing world is like trying to get into a secure military facility on wits and charm alone. The gatekeepers don't take kindly to a brazen newbie who doesn't play by their rules. The ability for an author to self-publish their work gives the power back to the writer, and ultimately, to everyday people like you and me. </p>
<p>This story is not just the tale of a charming young woman who gets kidnapped. It's a rabbit hole that puts you, the reader, smack in the middle of the main character's shoes. You will become Sophie Greer. What does it feel like when everyone around you seems to know you better than you know yourself? You will find out. What exactly is the global elite really up to during their secret society rituals? You will find out. And the answers will churn your stomach. </p>
<p>My book, <i>Daughter of Belial</i>, is not just a suspenseful and entertaining read. It's provocative and triggering. I've always found universal truths in fictional stories make the best reads, and <i>Daughter of Belial</i> is a shining example of that.</p>
<p>With the current mayhem reigning in the world, Sophie Greer's story needs to be told. Because it's not just her story. It's ours. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There are risks associated with any innovative endeavor. Publishing a book without the might of the major publishing houses behind you may be a challenge, but can it be done to great success? Yes! </p>
<p>Having an amazing story is crucial. But after that, what makes someone decide to buy a book? The front cover imagery and back jacket blurb are vital elements to enticing readers to take a chance on a new story.</p>
<p>With those elements and an excellent marketing strategy, <i>Daughter of Belial</i> has the potential to soar to incredible heights. But I can't do it alone. Your contribution will directly impact my ability to hire a fantastic editor and put a strong marketing team in place. </p>
<p>Regardless of whether I hit my intended goal, every dollar raised will go towards the successful launch of this book, and no matter what, it will be released in June 2021!</p>

Hi! My name is Jennifer Juvenelle and I'd like to share my story with you. This novel is more than four years in the making, and it's my greatest accomplishment to date. I began writing in the summer of 2016 without knowing or understanding how the life and tribulations of Sophie Greer would shape my life. Now, after all the writing (and rewriting) I'm ready to share the life-altering and sometimes shattering, tale of Sophie Greer in this epic first book of what will become the Daughter of Belial series. 
Given the expanding nature of the publishing industry, I've decided to self-publish, and now that my book is ready to launch, I plan to ensure it succeeds. This is why I'm running this campaign. Your generous contribution will play a vital role in helping Daughter of Belial reach a bigger audience. To do that, I must hire a professional editor, book designer, book marketer, as well as a distribution company, and run ads prior to and during the launch.
With your support and a lot of hard work, I'm confident this book will make self-publishing history!
Why am I so confident? Because I believe in the story. 
Here's a quick blurb to let you in on the action: 
Sophie Greer, a young consultant for a major mergers and acquisitions firm, wakes up hungover and dumped thinking her worst problem is catching her boyfriend cheating the day before. But things soon go from bad to worse when she's pulled into a complex family drama involving her billionaire boss, Edward Hughes, and his brutish half-brother, Wyatt McGregor. Betrayed by the man who raised her, and mysteriously targeted by the illustrious Hughes family, dark revelations propel Sophie down a wormhole so sinister and vast she may never find her way out. 
Will she discover her true power and save herself, or be crushed beneath the weight of the all-powerful secret Order of Belial? One thing is certain—family history can be deadly.
 
Looking for reader feedback? One peer reviewer had this to say: 
""In this, her debut novel, Jennifer writes so extraordinarily and exceptionally well, you will surely be taken on a wildly fascinating, and simultaneously horrifying thrill ride. Fasten your seat belt – once you go down this rabbit hole, you will not come back the same. This book is a truly captivating, provocative read.""
Want more? The most common comparisons from early reader responses that I've received for my writing have been to Gillian Flynn (Gone Girl) and Dan Brown (The Da Vinci Code). I'm humbled by their replies and while this story is definitely its own original saga, I'd be honored to stand amongst those bestselling behemoths.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The new Triangulation: Habitats anthology of science fiction, fantasy, and horror is within reach. Help us get it across the finish line? </p>
<p>Triangulation is an annual speculative fiction anthology series produced by <a href=""https://parsec-sff.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Parsec</a>, a Pittsburgh-area collective of speculative fiction writers, artists, and fans. Since 2003, the Triangulation series has published quality science fiction, fantasy, and horror. Our editorial staff is made up of volunteers, authors who believe speculative fiction makes the world a brighter place to live. One hundred percent of our income from all sources is used to cover the costs of publishing the anthology.</p>
<p>Beginning in 2019, Triangulation themes have been environmental in nature. The Dark Skies edition concerned light pollution. The Extinction edition was about the loss of biodiversity. This year’s Habitats edition is focused on <a href=""https://imprint-india.org/domains/sustainable-habitat"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">sustainable habitation</a>, ecosystems that provide food and shelter for people in ways that minimize resource depletion and waste production.</p>
<p>We’re presenting stories from authors who have been published in <i>Asimov’s, Analog, Clarkesworld, Strange Horizons, Daily Science Fiction, Beneath Ceaseless Skies, Escape Pod, Best of British Fantasy, and Best of British Science Fiction</i>. <strong>This year we’re also reprinting the classic 1972 Theodore Sturgeon story “Pruzy’s Pot.”</strong></p>
<p>The Habitats edition will contain ~230 pages of science fiction blended with some fantasy and a dash of horror. We have acquired 23 stories and 11 poems. The stories range from a bite-sized 300 words to a full meal of 5,000.</p>
<p>Our authors have created compelling narratives driven by characters required to make hard choices in settings that push the boundaries of imagination:</p>
<ul>
<li>A man learns where he draws the line when it comes to living sustainably.</li>
<li>Time dilation and cold sleep allow a traveler to passively observe humanity for thousands of years.</li>
<li>A gardener looks at the bright side of the zombie apocalypse.</li>
<li>Interested in sustainable housing? Get yourself a SustainaCrock™!</li>
<li>Gregor Samsa’s sister helps her students come to terms with the insects in their roof gardens.</li>
<li>Access to the multiverse has solved the real estate shortage. What could possibly go wrong?</li>

<h3>Story of My Book</h3>
<p><i>Mentor Coaching </i>is a guide to help mentors successfully work with the next generation of leaders. </p>
<p>My name is Terrice Thomas and I am the author of Mentor Coaching. I wrote this book because I was positively impacted by mentors as a young professional, and I would like to help others positively impact a mentee. To be properly prepared for the workforce, people still need coaching on many skills after college that a mentor can provide. <br/><br/>My hope is that, in reading this book, you will discover the importance of mentoring the next generation and how crucial it is for effective leadership. In this book, I hope to instill in you the same sort of passion and excitement that I have for mentoring young adults. Ultimately, I want you to see this book as a tool to help you be a more effective mentor while helping young adults gain personal and professional development. <br/><br/>In this book, you'll learn about effective mentoring techniques and hear best practices across the country from experts in a variety of industries. You'll hear stories such as...</p>
<ul>
<li>Pritika Padhi, HR leader (Mumbai, India) and the origins of “gurus” and other mentor misconceptions.</li>
<li>Morgan Malone, Director of Development (Chicago, IL) and the importance of social impact for the next generation.</li>
<li>Michael Mosby, football coach and nonprofit leader (Memphis, TN) and how coaches can help their players win on and off the field.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will love this book if you are a person that is passionate about social impact and want to be apart of giving back to your community. You will also love this book if you work with adolescents and young adults and want to help them successfully transition into adulthood or if you are a professional wanting to learn effective mentoring techniques.<br/><br/>Mentor Coaching is a nonfiction book that speaks to leaders and mentors who want to look at mentoring and young adults in a new way.</p>
<p><br/><strong>The Book - Mentor Coaching</strong></p>
<p>The book is written into 4 parts.<br/><br/>Part 1 contains the introduction + chapters 1-3. Part 1 explores the history of mentoring and its importance for youth and young adults. It also explains why millennials and Gen Z needs mentors just as much as children. “Adulting” is difficult to do alone and research shows that most students are struggling to make major life decisions alone. <br/><br/>Part 2 contains chapters 4-6. Part 2 provides insights into how to be an effective mentor to young adults. It explores the difference between good mentors and bad mentors and the mentoring vs coaching debate.<br/><br/>Part 3 contains chapters 7-11. Part 3 focuses on personal and professional development of young adults. It gives some of the top skills that business and organizational leaders have listed for success, and how to help mentees gain these skills.</p>

The Editor I will work with to revise and publish my manuscript in December 2021.
The Cover Design of my book. (The mockups you see currently are a placeholder!)
The Layout Design for the interior of my book (physical copy, ebook formats).
The Copyediting for my book to polish the grammar and spelling prior to publication.
The Launch & Promotion Efforts for my book when I ultimately publish this December.
I am also offering some exclusive rewards for people who pre-order my book now: 

You will receive a personally signed copy of my book when I publish and a handwritten thank-you note.
Your name will appear in the Acknowledgments section of my book (“with Special Thanks to”).
You will receive early access to the Introduction and some excerpts from my book, with the opportunity to review it and give me early feedback.

Risks & ChallengesThe biggest challenge with publishing a book is delivering the finished book to the backer, specifically my mailing of the book to you. I have eliminated this risk by building into the campaign the mailing and shipping costs of your signed copies to you within each pre-order tier.The risk of delivering the pre-sale copies of my book is contingent on the publisher we use. I will be working closely with New Degree Press to make sure we get the earliest possible ship date of the signed book copy to you. We will keep all pre-sale backers up-to-date as my book hits each key milestone and publishes. You will know when the copies are expected to ship. Other Ways You Can Help
Not everyone can support, but that doesn't mean you can't get something out of it!I will reward the top 3 people who refer the most backers at the end of the campaign (30 days). Here's how:

At the top of the campaign page, you will see the ""share"" buttons. Click on the ""chain"" icon to get a custom link just for you.
Copy that link and paste it on your social media, email it to a friend, or text a fellow book lover.
When someone clicks on that link and backs the book, you get 1 entry!
