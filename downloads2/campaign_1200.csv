</div><p>Hello everyone.</p><p>As we all know, Monty Oum was a very 
passionate, creative individual, as well as an inspiration to all of 
us. He was a role model to many people out there, inspired so many 
people with his creation and was no doubt, an amazing person. The news 
of his death was a shock for all of his fans and family, and he will be 
missed greatly by them all...</p><p>Nevertheless, Monty would want his fan to use their imagination and creativity to make the world a better, more colorful place.</p><p>The world of Remnant, is an obvious example of this. He had ambitious plans to make things technologically advanced and yet still connected to nature and not completely rejecting the notions of the outdoors. It's undeniable as to how he envisioned a world with so much color, and so much mood. One could say it would also lead into making said world for the fans to also diverge and create on- a stage for the people. And on this stage, we create our Characters to do as they were made to do, and act out the lives of Remnant.

<p><span>     Hello everyone! I've decided to open an Indiegogo campaign for the chance to make my jewelry designing
dreams a reality. Simply put, I love to design jewelry. I've been interested in jewelry since I was a little
girl. While I was in high school, I took a mixed media art class where I learned how to melt down metal to
make pendants, how to cut sheets of metal to create jewelry, and many other craft skills. That class
inspired me to take my creativity and apply it to jewelry making and I've been designing and hand
making jewelry ever since. My interest and love for jewelry was also shared by my aunt. We would go
to bead expos, seeing new designs, checking out the latest trends and would talk for hours about
jewelry when we were together. Unfortunately, she passed unexpectedly before I got the chance to
learn everything I could from her and I never got the chance to fully thank her for helping me grow my
passion.
</span></p>
<p><span>     Currently, I have been trying my best to save the funds I need by myself, but I have encountered
a few obstacles along the way. I spent some time unemployed and had some unexpected and unwanted
doctors visits which depleted a lot of my savings. The part time job I have now doesn’t provide me
with the hours I need to make enough money, so I've decided to use my free time in a much more
practical and constructive way. I am at the point now where I want to take my jewelry making to the
next level. I want to expand my creative knowledge and enhance the products I'm already making. I
have a book filled with designs that I would love to make into a reality. My designs are unique, fun,
and will be fantastic quality. I hand make all of my pieces, so each piece is uniquely different even if it
is one of the same design. All of the money raised in this Indiegogo campaign will go directly towards
buying all of the supplies and the tools that I'll need to make my designs and passion reality. If you
can donate, you will receive the item(s) from whatever tier you decide to donate to. If you can't donate,
but you like my designs, please show your friends and family. Tag, post, tweet etc. Any support would
mean the world to me. Thank you so much for taking the time to read my story and learn about my
passion. </span></p>

</p><p>Hi! Thanks for checking out The Gilded Lily IndieGogo campaign. We 
are so excited to have this opportunity, and are looking forward to 
sharing our craft with the world!</p><p><b>Who we are:</b></p><p>My 
mother, Julie has been designing and planning weddings for over twenty 
years, but has been creative her whole life. At one wedding, she hemmed 
the bride's gown moments before making an extra boutonniere for the 
officiant - who read the ceremony she wrote! Julie has been drawing, 
sewing, designing and crafting things for as long as I can remember, and
 it was her creative lead I was following when I, Kimberly, decided to 
become an Arizona Certified Master Florist. We've been designing 
weddings, tributes and every-day floral arrangements together for years.</p><p><b>What we're doing:</b></p><p>Together,
 my mom and I have a goal: To be able to take people's sentiments, 
hopes, wishes and memories and make them both beautiful and tangible in 
the form of uniquely designed floral arrangements. To make these 
arrangements available to you, we would like to open a flower shop, 
which we will call The Gilded Lily.</p><p><b>Why we're doing it:</b></p><p>We
 are blessed in that our artistic medium is one that is naturally 
beautiful: flowers. What nature does not provide is the sentiment. We 
want your mom to be thrilled that you remembered her birthday with her 
favorite shade of yellow roses. We want your grandfather to bring your 
grandmother a corsage of pink carnations, because that's what he did on 
their first date, and he's loved her ever since. We know we can bring 
these feelings to life for you.</p><p>On a personal note, I want this 
for my mom. In business, we are partners, but in life, she's the one who
 made my prom dress, nursed me when I was sick, changed my son's first 
stinky diaper (so glad it wasn't me - thanks mom!), and has been there 
for me my whole life. Now, it's time to make her dream happen, and I'm 
so lucky to share it with her.</p><p><b>Where it's going to happen:</b></p><p>We
 have a space in historic downtown Kingman, Arizona. It's a great brick 
building with a tin ceiling and fantastic windows, built in the 1920s. 
However, it needs some work. We need to update the electrical wiring, 
and install a flower cooler. And we need to paint over the magenta walls
 in the bathroom. Yikes.</p><p><b>When it's going down:</b></p><p>We're 
hoping to open the first week of February, with our ""official"" grand opening scheduled for March! That doesn't give us a lot of
 time, but we want to be able to serve the community for Valentine's 
Day! If you're thanking your partner for 50 great years, or saying, ""Hey
 baby, you're looking fly!"" to the cute girl in your office, we want to 
be a part of YOUR message.</p><p><b>How to help:</b></p><p>This is a partial rundown of what we need:</p><ul>
<li>Refrigeration unit and insulated panels - to give you the freshest possible product</li>
<li>Electrical contractor - To install the cooler, and bring our wiring up to code<br/>
</li>
<li>Permits - for construction of the cooler, and to open the business</li>
<li>building renovation - paint (lots of paint!), drywall, a door to our cooler, a counter top...</li>

<p>We have worked really hard to come up with creative and worthwhile perks . Please know these perks are offered with the sincerest thanks
 for helping make our dream a reality.</p>
<p>My mom and I have many 
reason for wanting to bring this project to life, but a couple really 
stand out. First, we know that in our area, our talents to make each 
customers' floral vision a reality is unique. Anyone can throw some 
flowers in a vase, but we can show you more. Secondly, and most 
importantly, we're doing this for and with our families. I want my sons 
to be provided for, and feel comfortable expressing themselves, and I 
want my mother to truly be fulfilled in sharing her gifts with the 
world.</p>
<p>So thanks IndieGogo and people of the internet! Can't wait to start sharing our progress with you!</p>
</div><br/></div>","Hi! Thanks for checking out The Gilded Lily IndieGogo campaign. We 
are so excited to have this opportunity, and are looking forward to 
sharing our craft with the world!Who we are:My 
mother, Julie has been designing and planning weddings for over twenty 
years, but has been creative her whole life. At one wedding, she hemmed 
the bride's gown moments before making an extra boutonniere for the 
officiant - who read the ceremony she wrote! Julie has been drawing, 
sewing, designing and crafting things for as long as I can remember, and
 it was her creative lead I was following when I, Kimberly, decided to 
become an Arizona Certified Master Florist. We've been designing 
weddings, tributes and every-day floral arrangements together for years.What we're doing:Together,
 my mom and I have a goal: To be able to take people's sentiments, 
hopes, wishes and memories and make them both beautiful and tangible in 
the form of uniquely designed floral arrangements. To make these 
arrangements available to you, we would like to open a flower shop, 
which we will call The Gilded Lily.Why we're doing it:We
 are blessed in that our artistic medium is one that is naturally 
beautiful: flowers. What nature does not provide is the sentiment. We 
want your mom to be thrilled that you remembered her birthday with her 
favorite shade of yellow roses. We want your grandfather to bring your 
grandmother a corsage of pink carnations, because that's what he did on 
their first date, and he's loved her ever since. We know we can bring 
these feelings to life for you.On a personal note, I want this 
for my mom. In business, we are partners, but in life, she's the one who
 made my prom dress, nursed me when I was sick, changed my son's first 
stinky diaper (so glad it wasn't me - thanks mom!), and has been there 
for me my whole life. Now, it's time to make her dream happen, and I'm 
so lucky to share it with her.Where it's going to happen:We
 have a space in historic downtown Kingman, Arizona. It's a great brick 
building with a tin ceiling and fantastic windows, built in the 1920s. 
However, it needs some work. We need to update the electrical wiring, 
and install a flower cooler. And we need to paint over the magenta walls
 in the bathroom. Yikes.When it's going down:We're 
hoping to open the first week of February, with our ""official"" grand opening scheduled for March! That doesn't give us a lot of
 time, but we want to be able to serve the community for Valentine's 
Day! If you're thanking your partner for 50 great years, or saying, ""Hey
 baby, you're looking fly!"" to the cute girl in your office, we want to 
be a part of YOUR message.How to help:This is a partial rundown of what we need:
Refrigeration unit and insulated panels - to give you the freshest possible product
Electrical contractor - To install the cooler, and bring our wiring up to code

Permits - for construction of the cooler, and to open the business
building renovation - paint (lots of paint!), drywall, a door to our cooler, a counter top...
delivery system - to keep the flowers from rolling around in the back of our van as we're delivering them to you
order processing stuff - a receipt printer, customer management software
And some of what you'll get in return:Flowers on your birthdayFall Flowers!

<p>I always had problems with money and being a freelancer doesn't always help since commissions are hard to get, so my mom has helped me till now with the college fees, rent and everything you can imagine. She's a single parent with minimal wage, and as you can imagine the odds aren't that good for her as well.</p>
<p>We were capable to manage somehow till now, until my computer and my tablet started to break down due to old age and over-use.

<h3>What is WITP?</h3>
<p>WITP was founded in 2013 as a one-time group show of 17 contemporary artists in London. The premise was to bring individual artists together and have them all answer the same question — 'What is the point?"". After two successful years, in 2015 WITP seized an opportunity to exhibit at the Mall Galleries in London, and the show doubled in size to include 35 international artists. The energy from that show resulted in an expansion from an annual show to an artists' community and communication network, with several shows per year, and in early 2016 we launched as a full-fledged corporation limited by guarantee, with an application in process to become a not-for-profit.</p>
<h3>What sets us apart from other arts organisations?</h3>
<ul>
<li>100% of a sale at a WITP exhibition goes straight back to the artist. We do not take a commission.</li>
<li>More than sales, our mission is to foster relationships among artists, galleries, buyers and industry professionals. </li>

The orchard that gives this 
exceptional peppercorns, coffee and cocoa, is about to become a 
supermarket, or the parking that will accommodate its customers. <br/>Worse, 
it is also bringing to its knees work done decades by men who chose the 
long road of agreement with the land rather than an illusory and 
unhealthy control. In this period of great ecological disorder, we must 
consider that each land taken at the expense of nature is itself a 
disaster.

<br/><br/>La familia... For 25 years, the farm has been using ecological and ethical agricultural practices to produce a pepper with exceptional aromas. It incorporates the use of compost, mulches of leaves and plants, with the addition of dolomite, to achieve a natural balance of calcium and magnesium cropland, and that's it.<br/>Harvesting is done manually at full ripeness, which gives a fresh flavor and very fruity for each selected cluster.<br/><br/><table>

From the south of Costa Rica on
 less than a hectare of a quasi wild land is produced some of the most unique, 
fragrant and flavourful peppercorns. Cultivated amongst a citrus grove 
and on land where only natural farming methods have been 
used for more than a quarter century, pepper vines provide habitat for 
birds and a variety of wildlife.
    
The orchard that gives this 
exceptional peppercorns, coffee and cocoa, is about to become a 
supermarket, or the parking that will accommodate its customers. Worse, 
it is also bringing to its knees work done decades by men who chose the 
long road of agreement with the land rather than an illusory and 
unhealthy control. In this period of great ecological disorder, we must 
consider that each land taken at the expense of nature is itself a 
disaster. 
    
    
We need your help in order to acquire this land and save its 
biodiversity.
  We have prepared for you great perks : by participating to this 
crowdfunding, you will get the finest pepper as you already know it, but
 also become the virtual owner of a piper negrum vine, so you can be 
sure to enjoy its benefits for many more years. 
We produced in 2016 only 410 kilos of Peppercorns and because of El Nino we could not make people's favorite white lemon mandarina peppercorns.  
All what's left from the golden spice will be delivered with the perks.
  



""1000 years ago ... peppercorns were worth 10 times their weight in gold""




  








today it is about the same with these very rare peppercorns from Costa Rica


 



Costa Rica: Agroforestry landscape









Your action :

--- planting a seed for the next generations ---





Your support will allow Original NY ltd. the acquisition of the land where its farmers will continue enjoying the fruits of the orchard and thousands of plants and trees will be planted on the planet .


--- by participating in this crow funding, with 8 $  ---


  you are involved in the preservation of a piece of nature where plants, trees, men, insects, animals



and earth live in harmony and produce the best peppercorns and coffee in the world.



Our immediate action will be to send you our very rare peppercorns and plant a tree, a plant 

or a seed to your name in the orchard 


and in Costa Rica where we have many friends in the need of planting.

    
  
  


We do not claim for a fair trade, just an organic, sustainable, intelligent and simply human agriculture which we consider as a normal trade. 

 100% pure is an insurance to eat food produced with much love, zero inputs whatsoever, zero pesticides. as pure as it can get.
100% pure, single estate Original Denis 
warranty the pure origin .

   
   
  
La familia... For 25 years, the farm has been using ecological and ethical agricultural practices to produce a pepper with exceptional aromas. It incorporates the use of compost, mulches of leaves and plants, with the addition of dolomite, to achieve a natural balance of calcium and magnesium cropland, and that's it.Harvesting is done manually at full ripeness, which gives a fresh flavor and very fruity for each selected cluster.



 


   



Drying pepper is alternately sun and shelter for about two weeks,
100% pure Lemon Mandarina White Peppercorns is unique. ""Like a great wine"" white pepper is aged in the native lemon juice of this same soil.

  The unique and natural citrus flavour permeates the mature peppercorns and imparts a golden hue to the corns themselves. Today, 100% pure peppercorns is recognized worldwide for its freshness, taste and nutritional qualities.


   

It has the reputation of being the best peppers in the world. 

Save the orchard and its biodiversity...
650 to 700 pepper plants, the 40 or 50 orange trees, 8 to 10 cacao trees, mango trees and banana trees.
  
   ,Since 2012, Original Denis  sponsors this uncommon farm .
  
  


 
Original Denis is an entrepreneur, artist and ecologist. 

 
 
Note du porteur de projet - FairWind :


""La première fois que j'arrive chez Original Denis, je me dis : ok.. Je viens de rencontrer Mick Jagger reconverti en dealer.""

Il m’a accueilli avec un large sourire plein de bienveillance, le guérisseur venait de rencontrer son malade. Cela faisait longtemps que ma quête de guérison au travers de la nourriture était en stagnation, le moment était tout choisi.Un appart jonché de sachets hermétiques de grande qualité, remplis de je ne sais quelles denrées venues d’ailleurs et conservées tel un trésor. Le tout bien gardé par une légion de dragons de papier, sous le regard bienveillant des anges, de tatie marguerite. Après une succincte présentation réciproque, on passe aux choses sérieuses. Étant grand amateur de café, c’est par lui que je vais découvrir ces produits 100% Pure (concept auquel j’ai du mal à adhérer à ce moment précis). Jusqu'à ce que, première claque... J’ai oublié mon expresso préparé dans les règles de l’art, je suis en train de consommer du café : une nourriture vivante est en train de me raconter son histoire, 

je voyage en pleine jungle amazonienne, et pour pas si cher finalement. Car oui, quand Denis m’annonce les tarifs de ses produits, je me dis qu’on est vraiment dans un luxe délirant venu tout droit des desiderata malsains de quelques richissimes clients.


Bref… Wassai sauvage, bananes séchées, banane-wassai,

 et enfin le poivre… Le roi.


A la fin de cette entrevue, deux sensations s’immiscent dans tout mon être :•	Mon petit corps dis hmmm, c’est bon, mais tu y est allé fort...• Ma petite tête va utiliser toute son énergie et sa créativité pour aider ce personnage à sauver sa production, son poivre, et comme il appelle affectueusement  ses fermiers : ""la familia"".



Ensuite j’ai acheté ma première tablette de chocolat à $100, le doigt dans l'engrenage...


 uhmf… J’ai eu droit à un petit discount… Un cadeau pour un chirurgien qui a sauvé ma vie : 60g de pure cacao

 avec lequel un quart d’ongle suffit à remplir une matinée de douceur et volupté buccales. 

Un quart d'ongle j'ai dit...! Enfin cela en vaut chaque cent. 

Ça y est j’ai compris, ça y est je l’ai fait, et je ne pourrais plus revenir en arrière.

Bref depuis ce jour, je me surprends à suçoter un petit grain de poivre, qui vient réveiller et désinfecter ma bouche,

déguster un petit morceau de wassai sauvage, unique et incroyable,me régaler de bananes séchées, 

d’envisager ma nourriture différemment, et ça je le dois à Original Denis.

April 19th or April 20th, 2016.
I've been creating Light Painting Portraits far wide for decades.   My crew and I Light Painted on
     America’s Got Talent, to rave reviews.  With my friends, I created and crowd funded the portrait photo book The People of Burning Man.  Here are photos I took at the Percona MySQL contention in 2013 and 2015.
Light Painting Portraits
are a rare and incredible art form.  I’ve
been pioneering and expanding this art form. 
This campaign will help me to take Light Painting portraits in places
where it would otherwise be impossible.  With
your help, the studio will be equipped with the best technology imaginable, which
will make for countless magical and fantastical images. 
This can only happen with your help. How you can help
Funding: Your support is vital!  If you can help financially, you'll be bringing this project to life.
Help spread the word:  Sharing the video on Facebook or elsewhere helps the project tremendously.
What We Need


The video spells out most of the items that are needed.  But if you have specific questions about any of the equipment or anything else, feel free to ask.  We've done research into the plans, the equipment, and have already started much of the work.


Here are a few links that are cool.  The Olympus cameras with LiveBulb.  The light painting tools the pixelstick and PixelWhip.  And here are some fun xbox Kinect hacks.  





This is historic!

Picasso was one of the light painting trailblazers.   We are  continuing to trailblaze with this art form... technically, creatively, and socially.  Very often I will light paint somebody and it will be their very first introduction to the craft.  Light painting makes people happy.  :-)   This is a chance to bring this art-form to far more people.
There are many great portrait photographers.  There are a good number of folks experimenting with light painting.  But very few humans on earth can make a fast quality custom Light Painting portrait.  Creating such portraits is profoundly rewarding for me.
    The risk and the glory Why this will work out perfectlyJulian has light painted with countless people over many years at many events.   When Julian and his friend set a goal, they  tend to meet it.

Why this is riskyMuch of this has never been done before.  We will inevitably run into hurdles and will be adjusting course as we go.  Also, the timing is very tight.   In other words, things may not turn out exactly as we think at this point, but one way or another, we will make this stupendous.

My Prius, which I use to drive throughout central Illinois (driving up to 1.5 hours just in one direction) to photograph this project, now suffers from a dead battery (which costs approximately $3,000 to replace).  This fund will be used to purchase a new battery, and any funds beyond will be put towards publishing this series in book form.<span><br/></span><span><span><br/></span>Thank you for taking the time to consider helping not only me, but those who are invisible as well.<span><br/></span>-Lexie Bragg<br/></span><span><span><span><br/></span>Artist Statement:<br/></span>Seeking the Invisible<br/>The dirty looks, the unkind words, these things I have experienced myself, and seen done to others. This is a story that needs to be told. It all comes down to this simple statement: “but you don’t look sick.” this prevailing attitude is one of the key obstacles faced by individuals with what is frequently called an invisible illness. This project attempts to look at the human face of those who suffer from invisible illnesses and invisible disabilities. Through this work, I hope to tell the stories of those who “don’t look sick,” and to examine the fragility of the human body and how our society looks upon people with invisible illnesses.<br/>I started this project because of my own invisible illness and that of my family. However, I still found myself passing judgment on those whose illness I could not see – as well as seeing judgment passed by others about me. This led me to question what it means to be sick, and how this idea shapes the world of those with invisible illnesses, and those who are outside of it.<br/>The human body is something that many of us take for granted. When the body works perfectly, it is something that goes unnoticed. The fact that our heart pumps our blood correctly, that the chemical levels in our brain are equal, or that we are not in constant pain is something that is usually ignored by those who are unaffected by it. The idea that such things could go wrong with our body, and that they eventually will, is something that we choose not to think about. In this project, I attempt to portray some of the unimaginable things that can go wrong with the human body and often with no physical outward signs.<br/>Photographing people with invisible illnesses is not a new idea. Hugh Welch Diamond thought that photographing the mentally ill would aid in curing them, assuming that one could see the illness somehow on the outside. Today, many photographers work to photograph individuals with invisible illness, and to promote the idea that such things are normal and that the people who suffer from them are not different than you or I. However, it is my attempt to investigate the inside world of invisible illness’s that sets my work apart. There is so much more that needs to be explored than a simple labeling of individuals with invisible illnesses. In this work, I attempt to humanize a reality that goes so much deeper than looks.<br/>Finding my models on craigslist and facebook, I arrange to visit with them in their homes and talk with them about their past, their present difficulties and how they cope with their illness. Through two sessions, i develop a portrait of the person and try to capture a glimpse into their life and their illness. By photographing them in their personal surroundings, I try to define the individual person beyond the illness. To photograph a glimpse into their life, we recreate a scene or an action that shows the pain and difficulty of their illness in an attempt to make the invisible visible. These glimpses range from completely structured recreation to straight documentary, depending on the decision made by the model and myself.<br/>A statement is requested from each model, giving them the chance to discuss key elements of their daily lives. Through the camera, I try to document their daily life through an outside perspective. With the addition of a personal statement, this project becomes multi-dimensional, a collaboration between what the world sees and what the person experiences. This is important to help humanize the individuals in the photographs, taking them from simple faces to fleshed out individuals with real-life stories.<br/>These statements, though a crucial part of the project, are set apart from the photographs to lessen the desire to try matching each statement with an individual. This is further done by not including every statement on the wall display. As the project focuses on invisible illnesses, I do not want to give the answer to what is “wrong” with each individual, but instead leave it as much of a mystery as to what one would experience upon seeing them in the real world. When in book form, every statement would be included, though still separated from each correlating photograph. For the act of showing these on the wall display, the statements have been edited to create a more palatable experience. Enough information is given to provide the viewer an inside look, but short enough to allow the viewer to digest the information in a short amount of time.<br/>By working in collaboration with my model through portrait, a personal statement and a glimpse into their daily life, I hope to create a more immersive and truthful body of work. Before we meet, several e- mails or phone calls are exchanged to discuss who I am, what I intend to do, and why. When entering their home, I set aside an hour to talk with them before we begin shooting. This is intended to put the model at ease, as well as to find details that may be important to me as an artist, but are perhaps over looked by the model. Although I normally have a plan of action in mind based on our previous discussions, I allow the session to be very fluid. I am not working to make the photograph say what I want it to say, but to create an image that both the model and myself feel work to answer the search for the invisible.<br/>A very important aspect of this project is the reaction I have received from my models. Every one of them thanked me for doing this project – for taking the time to look at them as people, to see not only beyond their illness, but perhaps to see into the illness as well. It is their praise that reminds me of this project’s importance and relevance.<br/>The human body is incredibly fragile, and it is a fact that we often forget. The core question of this project is the idea of what it means to be “sick,” and how the world reacts to it. Does one need to prove to the world that they are sick in order to receive the respect and care they deserve? How do we want others to react to our invisible illness, and how do we cope in a world where we live with the invisible, and finally, how does one tell the story of the fragility of humanity?<span><br/></span></span></p></div>","Seeking the Invisible is a documentary project that seeks to tell the story of those who suffer from invisible illnesses and disabilities and who feel ignored, over looked and judged.  I have been thanked by countless people-those who suffer from invisible illnesses, as well as those who don't, but even with the importance of this project, I am unable to continue in my current state.

<h3>We need your help!</h3>
<p>Our plan is to construct our sculpture out of Baltic Birch plywood cut by CNC. The wood alone will cost nearly $2,000. We'll also need to transport it to Black Rock City, purchase fabric to sew costumes, and supplies for props and for cinnamon rolls which we'll be serving daily at the shrine in a cult-like ritual. If we fall short of our fundraising goal, we'll be making up the difference out-of-pocket.</p>
<h3>About the artists</h3>
<p>This will be Chris and Andrew's fourth burn, and second major Burning Man art project. We are dedicated to making this sculpture a reality and have the know-how to get it done--we just need some help with financing. Along with Andrew and Chris, we've got a solid build/interactive team including Jennifer Johnson, Adalyn Naka, Jonathan Schoonhoven, and Caroline Whittinghill.</p>

<p><i><strong>T</strong></i><i><strong>he publication accompanying the UFO Visual Lab exhibition​</strong></i></p>
<p>Alternative Facts to dowód w sprawie, która toczy się od wielu lat, na wszystkich kontynentach. Sprawa istnienia UFO nie została rozstrzygnięta, mimo że nieustannie ujawniają się nowi naoczni świadkowie. Popularne przedstawienia istot pozaziemskich zdają się zaciemniać obraz sytuacji. Zwróciliśmy się do tych, którzy widzieli, by przedstawili dowody tutaj, na Ziemi. Oto efekt naszych poszukiwań. Nielinearna historia śladów, znaków, paradoksów fizyki, świateł z nieznanego źródła – na pierwszy rzut oka znajome. Im dłużej jednak patrzysz, im wnikliwiej badasz przykładając do siebie majaczące na horyzoncie rozpikselowane grupy atomów, tym pewniejsze jest zdaje się być tylko to, że jesteś obcy w miejscu, gdzie „wszyscy jesteśmy ludźmi, a Ziemia to nasza planeta”.</p>
<p>Alternative Facts - Skoroszyt hakowy, Zin A4 – 60 stron, Zin A6 – 24 strony, odbitka srebrowa; Nakład: 50 egzemplarzy; Wydawca: Paper Beats Rock; Projekt: Katarzyna Ewa Legendź, Katarzyna Zolich; Partnerzy: Fresh From Poland, Fotobzik</p>
<p>Publikacja towarzysząca wystawie UFO Visual Lab prezentowanej w Galerii Szara Kamienica w dniach 21.05.2017 – 03.06.2017 r. </p>
<p><i>Alternative facts is an evidence in the case that has been going on for a long time now, on all continents. The UFO case is far from being resolved, although eyewitnesses are constantly being revealed. The pop-representations of all things extraterrestrial seem to obscure the true picture of the situation. We turned to those who saw things and made them show us the evidence here, on Earth. Here you have it – the effect of our research. A non-linear narrative of traces, signs, physical paradoxes, lights coming from the unknown sources – all looking pretty familiar, at the first glance. But the longer you look, the more closely you investigate and juxtapose the pixelated atoms on the horizon, the clearer it gets - it is likely that you’re not at home in your own home, that you’re a mere alien to the „place where we are all human, and Earth is our planet”.</i></p>

<p><i><strong>Zine STRING PHOTOGRAPHY by eightsweetlimbs (Grażyna Siedlecka &amp; Nicko Straniero)</strong></i></p>
<p>'String Photography' to pierwszy wspólny projekt Grażyny Siedleckiej i Nicko Straniero w duecie zwanym eightsweetlimbs. Do tego projektu użyliśmy dwóch jednorazowych aparatów fotograficznych związanych sznureczkiem i robiliśmy sobie nawzajem zdjęcia w tym samym momencie, pokazując zupełnie różne perspektywy wybranej dzielnicy Londynu w letnie popołudnie 2014 roku. (Laserowy druk na papierze ksero)</p>
<p><i>'String Photography' is the first of an ongoing series of collaborations between Grażyna Siedlecka and Nicko Straniero as eightsweetlimbs. For this project we used two disposable cameras, tied them together with a string and took simultaneous photos of each other so to reveal diametrically opposed backgrounds of an area in London we were exploring during a summer afternoon in 2014.

Czemu UFO? / Why UFO?

Niezidentyfikowane Obiekty Latające [NOL-e] oraz życie pozaziemskie są motywem który regularnie pojawia się w kulturze, mediach i naukowych dyskusjach od wielu lat.
Unidentified Flying Objects and extraterrestrials have been the themes appearing in the mainstream media and science discussions regularly since many years.
Wydaje nam się niezwykle ciekawym pytaniem: czemu ludzie chcą wierzyć? Jak to możliwe, że tak wielu z nas 'wie' jak wygląda coś, czego istnienie nigdy nie zostało udowodnione? Czemu idea UFO bez przerwy inspiruje artystów do tworzenia powieści, filmów, dzieł sztuki?
We find it extremely interesting: why people want to believe? How come so many of us 'know', how the flying saucers or aliens look like, although no one has ever proved they exist? Why the idea of UFO continuously inspires continuously inspire artists to produce stories, movies, artworks?
Budujemy bibliotekę oraz linię czasu pokazującą niezwykły rozwój mitu UFO na przestrzeni dziesięcioleci.
We are creating a library and a timeline to show detailed evolution of the UFO myth.
Zaprosiliśmy dziesięciu niezwykłych polskich artystów do stworzenia prac na ten temat. Oto oni: Franek Ammer (instalacja i publikacja), Gosia Ćwiech (instalacja fotograficzna), Artur Gołębiowski (ilustracje), Grupa TBX (Paweł Bagiński, Miłosz Cirocki, Wojtek Skrzypczyński - instalacja wideo), Kamil #2 (CGI), Anna Kieblesz (fotografie), Karol Liver (fotografie), Michał Matejko (fotografie i publikacja), Kaja Rata (fotografie), Katarzyna Zolich (wideo footage).
We invited 10 artists to create artworks on this topic: Franek Ammer (art installation and publication), Gosia Ćwiech (photo installation), Artur Gołębiowski (illustrations), Grupa TBX (Paweł Bagiński, Miłosz Cirocki, Wojtek Skrzypczyński - video installation), Kamil #2 (CGI), Anna Kieblesz (photographs), Karol Liver (photographs), Michał Matejko (photographs and publication), Kaja Rata (photographs), Katarzyna Zolich (video footage).

If we can't reach our total financial goal, we have to cut down on the amount of works, publications or promo materials. If we raise more than needed, all extra money will be used for taking UFO Visual Lab project to London and Ukraine!

ZIN ALTERNATIVE FACTS
Publikacja towarzysząca wystawie UFO Visual Lab
ALTERNATIVE FACTS ZINE
The publication accompanying the UFO Visual Lab exhibition​
Alternative Facts to dowód w sprawie, która toczy się od wielu lat, na wszystkich kontynentach. Sprawa istnienia UFO nie została rozstrzygnięta, mimo że nieustannie ujawniają się nowi naoczni świadkowie. Popularne przedstawienia istot pozaziemskich zdają się zaciemniać obraz sytuacji. Zwróciliśmy się do tych, którzy widzieli, by przedstawili dowody tutaj, na Ziemi. Oto efekt naszych poszukiwań. Nielinearna historia śladów, znaków, paradoksów fizyki, świateł z nieznanego źródła – na pierwszy rzut oka znajome. Im dłużej jednak patrzysz, im wnikliwiej badasz przykładając do siebie majaczące na horyzoncie rozpikselowane grupy atomów, tym pewniejsze jest zdaje się być tylko to, że jesteś obcy w miejscu, gdzie „wszyscy jesteśmy ludźmi, a Ziemia to nasza planeta”.
Alternative Facts - Skoroszyt hakowy, Zin A4 – 60 stron, Zin A6 – 24 strony, odbitka srebrowa; Nakład: 50 egzemplarzy; Wydawca: Paper Beats Rock; Projekt: Katarzyna Ewa Legendź, Katarzyna Zolich; Partnerzy: Fresh From Poland, Fotobzik
Publikacja towarzysząca wystawie UFO Visual Lab prezentowanej w Galerii Szara Kamienica w dniach 21.05.2017 – 03.06.2017 r. 
Alternative facts is an evidence in the case that has been going on for a long time now, on all continents. The UFO case is far from being resolved, although eyewitnesses are constantly being revealed. The pop-representations of all things extraterrestrial seem to obscure the true picture of the situation. We turned to those who saw things and made them show us the evidence here, on Earth. Here you have it – the effect of our research. A non-linear narrative of traces, signs, physical paradoxes, lights coming from the unknown sources – all looking pretty familiar, at the first glance. But the longer you look, the more closely you investigate and juxtapose the pixelated atoms on the horizon, the clearer it gets - it is likely that you’re not at home in your own home, that you’re a mere alien to the „place where we are all human, and Earth is our planet”.
Alternative Facts- Hook folder, A4 Zine – 60 p., A6 Zine – 24 p., silver gelatin print; Edition: 50 copies; Publisher: Paper Beats Rock; Design: Katarzyna Ewa Legendź, Katarzyna Zolich; Partners: Fresh From Poland, Fotobzik.

Zine STRING PHOTOGRAPHY by eightsweetlimbs (Grażyna Siedlecka & Nicko Straniero)
'String Photography' to pierwszy wspólny projekt Grażyny Siedleckiej i Nicko Straniero w duecie zwanym eightsweetlimbs. Do tego projektu użyliśmy dwóch jednorazowych aparatów fotograficznych związanych sznureczkiem i robiliśmy sobie nawzajem zdjęcia w tym samym momencie, pokazując zupełnie różne perspektywy wybranej dzielnicy Londynu w letnie popołudnie 2014 roku. (Laserowy druk na papierze ksero)
'String Photography' is the first of an ongoing series of collaborations between Grażyna Siedlecka and Nicko Straniero as eightsweetlimbs. For this project we used two disposable cameras, tied them together with a string and took simultaneous photos of each other so to reveal diametrically opposed backgrounds of an area in London we were exploring during a summer afternoon in 2014. (Laser colour photocopied on normal paper)

<p><strong>Meet Jacques Nkinzingabo</strong></p>
<p>Born 1994 ( One Week before the Genocide against Tutsi in Rwanda ), I lost my father when i was still a baby and my mother left me with my older brother at the age of five to look for a house We could stay in after loosing all we had before the Genocide. For Few Months, I lived the life of an orphan and Street kids at the same time until I met My Mom again. Even so, my mother didn’t have the means to support the family so I went to the streets looking for money and food by myself.</p>
<p>I stumbled upon photography in 2009, seven years into the art and I am glad that accidentally i found my passion, which has now become my career. Whose passion for photography came to me in a class assignment, My school director was looking for a student to help in capturing images around the school for some projects / Events.I found myself volunteering to do the job despite the fact that he knew nothing about the gadget I now held in awe.</p>
<p>I was only 15 at the time. Two years later, I was working for different websites and Newspapers in Kigali as a photojournalist- thanks to the accidental activity.</p>
<p>My motivation comes from telling the Rwandan story away from the stifling images and stories about the 1994 genocide against Tutsi, already in the mainstream media. On completing high school in 2013, I decided to engage fully in photography to change the perspective of Rwanda’s story.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>Why Am I doing a Fund Campaign? </strong></p>
<p>In 2014, Jacques equipped with phones and small cameras, he started teaching simple photography techniques to kids with disabilities in an orphanage. Soon after, the government found host families for the kids and the program came to an end.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471382167/h8m0nklgnsxhbyu3jvej.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In 2015, while working on one of my personal photo projects documenting the lives of ‘Marines’, (street kids based around the Nyabugogo bus station who are known for stealing phones at night) I realised they had the potential to document their own lives.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471382331/bsf8ywjeizs6wqhnz2wi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Whenever they could, they would grab my camera and take pictures of each other. They loved being around  me as the photographer and became very interested in the project. I felt the urge to start teaching them skills to give them the opportunity to show the world around them. Most classes were given at night, when the rest of Kigali was asleep.</p>
<p><strong>I need your help to travel to Germany for the Exhibition and to make Learning for change Globally.</strong></p>
<p>In May 2016, I invited by akume E.V (Association of African Arts Based in Ravensburg , Germany ) for presenting photos  from the workshop of the kids in Germany apart of <strong>The Night of Art Festival </strong>and continue this project with  kids in Germany as and We are looking forward to work with refugees in the future for this Project.</p>
<p>I’ve got money and Support to make our First Exhibition in Kigali on 08<sup>th</sup> September at Germany Culture Center in Kigali but I need your help to make our second exhibition in Germany.</p>
<p>We are looking for support of 2000 USD for my flight to Germany and other needs including Transport, Photo Printing + Framing for the Exhibition and Catalogues for the Exhibition.</p>
<p><strong>What Is Learning For change?</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471382587/yyiysqqcu31ewfcftntf.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Learning4change is an ongoing initiative where Jacques do photography-workshops with the street-kids of Kigali. Aims With Learning for Change is to offer activities and workshops for the homeless kids.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471382946/j3y8icylhaipiydbm2yg.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>A Goal with learning4change is to create education activities, offer opportunities , give them a voice involve in continuous social engagement , improve their lives , to educate , self-sustainable and to empower Street kids and young people without opportunities.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1471383562/dlvmgzidgo8cwtm5vpmf.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong>So why such an interest in street kids?</strong></p>

</div></div>","Meet Jacques Nkinzingabo
Born 1994 ( One Week before the Genocide against Tutsi in Rwanda ), I lost my father when i was still a baby and my mother left me with my older brother at the age of five to look for a house We could stay in after loosing all we had before the Genocide. For Few Months, I lived the life of an orphan and Street kids at the same time until I met My Mom again. Even so, my mother didn’t have the means to support the family so I went to the streets looking for money and food by myself.
I stumbled upon photography in 2009, seven years into the art and I am glad that accidentally i found my passion, which has now become my career. Whose passion for photography came to me in a class assignment, My school director was looking for a student to help in capturing images around the school for some projects / Events.I found myself volunteering to do the job despite the fact that he knew nothing about the gadget I now held in awe.
I was only 15 at the time. Two years later, I was working for different websites and Newspapers in Kigali as a photojournalist- thanks to the accidental activity.
My motivation comes from telling the Rwandan story away from the stifling images and stories about the 1994 genocide against Tutsi, already in the mainstream media. On completing high school in 2013, I decided to engage fully in photography to change the perspective of Rwanda’s story.
Why Am I doing a Fund Campaign? 
In 2014, Jacques equipped with phones and small cameras, he started teaching simple photography techniques to kids with disabilities in an orphanage. Soon after, the government found host families for the kids and the program came to an end.

In 2015, while working on one of my personal photo projects documenting the lives of ‘Marines’, (street kids based around the Nyabugogo bus station who are known for stealing phones at night) I realised they had the potential to document their own lives.

Whenever they could, they would grab my camera and take pictures of each other. They loved being around  me as the photographer and became very interested in the project. I felt the urge to start teaching them skills to give them the opportunity to show the world around them. Most classes were given at night, when the rest of Kigali was asleep.
I need your help to travel to Germany for the Exhibition and to make Learning for change Globally.
In May 2016, I invited by akume E.V (Association of African Arts Based in Ravensburg , Germany ) for presenting photos  from the workshop of the kids in Germany apart of The Night of Art Festival and continue this project with  kids in Germany as and We are looking forward to work with refugees in the future for this Project.
I’ve got money and Support to make our First Exhibition in Kigali on 08th September at Germany Culture Center in Kigali but I need your help to make our second exhibition in Germany.
We are looking for support of 2000 USD for my flight to Germany and other needs including Transport, Photo Printing + Framing for the Exhibition and Catalogues for the Exhibition.
What Is Learning For change?

Learning4change is an ongoing initiative where Jacques do photography-workshops with the street-kids of Kigali. Aims With Learning for Change is to offer activities and workshops for the homeless kids.

A Goal with learning4change is to create education activities, offer opportunities , give them a voice involve in continuous social engagement , improve their lives , to educate , self-sustainable and to empower Street kids and young people without opportunities.

So why such an interest in street kids?
‘Homeless children on the streets of Kigali have very limited chances to improve their lives’. Although I have never been a street kid as such for a longtime, I have my own experience on the streets and spending my time with street kids. Through this program I want to improve the situation of the kids through Photography activities, engagement and workshops because education brings development.

<h3>Why This Project?</h3>
<p>I've been making artist books and prints for over fifteen years. Finally, I'm gathering the tools and equipment I need to have a fully functional home studio. It's been a dream of mine to run a small printing business, and this project is a way for me to come one step closer to making that a reality. </p>
<p>I like making affordable, functional art. I love to send postcards, make tiny books to send through the mail, and create handmade books that people can fill with their own ideas and creative pursuits. I like adding a little joy and beauty into life wherever I can. Your contributions to this campaign will help me get rolling and create more of the little things that make me happy—and hopefully they'll make you and your friends happy, too!</p>
<p>I'm extremely grateful for your contributions, no matter the size. Your support means you believe in me and believe in art, and believe it has an important place in our lives. </p>

</div><div>
<h3>Your Support + Perks</h3>
<p>Your contributions will help me get the tools I need to get this studio running:</p>
<ul>
<li>Metal typefaces ($150 for one typeface to get me going). This is a huge benefit. Without type, I have to have special polymer plates made to print text, and that's a big expense. If I don't intend to use the plates again, it's quite wasteful. But metal type can be reused over and over, for years. Plus, it's at the heart of letterpress printing.</li>
<li>Wood type ($150-250). This is hard to come by, and fairly expensive. It's hard to find complete sets that are in good condition, but I've finally found a good source. I use wood type for posters, for books, and sometimes for image making. A good wood face will last a lifetime. </li>
<li>Drying rack for prints ($135-150). Have you ever lived with a printmaker who has no drying rack? I confess, I've had to string up clotheslines in my living room before, just so I could hang an edition of prints to dry. A tower-style rack will be a big improvement–and preserve the integrity of the prints (and save me from those embarrassing moments when I forget the line is strung up).</li>
<li>Various tools for the press and bindery ($250-400): A book press, book weights, a roller gauge, a type high gauge, spacing material for typesetting, leading, and registration guides. These are things I've been making do without, but to finally be able to purchase them will make printing much more efficient and allow me to work on a larger scale.</li>
<li>Your contributions also cover the cost of this project: materials like cover stock for the calendar, paper for the books, book covers, binder's board, book cloth, cover stock for cards, envelopes, ink, linoleum blocks, the photopolymer plate needed for printing the calendar text, and postage for the mailing of all perks. </li>
</ul>
<p>The photos you see on this page are works in progress (check out the image gallery for more). At this stage, I've created a digital proof of the calendar so that I can create that fancy printing plate with the calendar text, and used the two blocks I've proofed to serve as a map of what the finished image might look like. Now that I have printer's proofs, I can go back and carve a little more from the blocks to get them just right for the final image. What you see pictured is an early artist's proof. The final image will be much more refined.  </p>
<p>Note: Any funds that exceed the goal will help me get more printing gadgets on my wish list, allow me to create more work, and help me with the cost of starting a business. And YES there will be stretch goals. First up: when I reach the first goal of $1500, I'll design a bookplate and send every supporter a set of 15. </p>
<p><i>Pictured below: the model I've made of the 4.5"" x 6"" size handmade book. </i></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>And now for the best part—the Perks: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>The bird lover's 12"" x 19"" wall calendar for 2017</strong>. It's 100% letterpress printed with love, and designed so that at the end of the year, you can trim off the calendar and still have the multi-color print ready to frame and enjoy for years to come. The bird image itself is 8"" x 10"". Printed on heavy stock from the French Paper Company in Niles, Michigan. Each calendar is signed and numbered.  </li>
<li>
<strong>A handmade book that features a cover made from the bird print.</strong> Use it as a journal or a sketchbook. Size is approximately 4.5"" x 6"", so you can easily take it anywhere when you travel. It's hardbound with book cloth and high quality paper, hand-sewn by me. Approx. 160-180 pages for you to fill. Everybody needs a beautiful book to fill with their thoughts. This one is durable enough to last you a long time. </li>
<li>
<strong>Set of greeting cards. </strong>These will also be letterpress printed, with designs similar to the birds on the calendar. I'll create two designs and send you a set of six cards with matching envelopes that you can share with your friends. </li>
</ul>
<p>The best part? <strong>I'll ship by December 17</strong>, so you can give these items away as gifts! (I can only guarantee Christmas delivery to US addresses.)</p>
</div><div><h3> </h3></div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>It takes time and commitment to complete letterpress projects. A calendar can be a tricky thing, but I've been wanting to do one for a long time. I design complex letterpress projects by nature, and I always finish them. You can <a href=""http://www.firebrandpress.org/editions/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">see some of my artist books on my website</a> and see more of what I do. My artist books are held in a number of special collections libraries here in the states (the Library of Congress, Duke University, Washington University, and Vanderbilt, just to name a few), and I've been fortunate to have my work in some libraries and galleries overseas as well. </p>
<p>Letterpress printing is a slow, sometimes rigorous process, but the beauty of the printed page makes it its own reward. I've done <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1201741110/not-just-another-roadside-attraction-a-letterpress?ref=nav_search"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">one other crowd-funded project</a> (in 2011), which allowed me to travel to New Mexico and Texas and create an artist book based on historic places I found that were being salvaged in a way that benefitted the surrounding communities. That project was funded beyond its goal and was completed on time—I'm super grateful to all of its backers, who helped me find some truly inspiring people and places during that time. That book was a ton of fun to make, and I wouldn't have made it if it wasn't for all of my supporters. </p>
<p>I'm one of those people who likes a good challenge. Plus, I'm an Aries. We never give up.</p>

<h3>The Order Anisoptera</h3>
<p>Resilience, metamorphosis......a talent that lay dormant.....a spanner in the works that causes me to rethink how I live and begin to paint again. </p>
<ul>
<li>My name is Samantha Rochard, and I live in Trinidad and Tobago. I am attempting to kick-start a second career, using my artistic talent, to allow me to work with health limitations that I have (don't want to get into that much)</li>
<li>With the help of this campaign funding, I hope to create a series of Dragonfly Paintings, to hold a second solo exhibition (my first was in 2006).   In addition, these images would be used to create motivational merchandise. This would be step one.</li>
<li>Your assistance in funding will go to the purchase of material to create the paintings, and cover minimal expenses while I do so. From the sale of these, I hope to be able to create motivational merchandise to encourage persons to live their dream.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Buy me a cup of coffee or more</h3>
<p>Not sure where you live, but a cup of fancy shmancy coffee in my country is about US$4. Buy me a cup (not that I drink coffee), but each cup can afford me a new canvas.</p>
<ul>
<li>My target is US$4000, enough for canvas, paints, brushes to create 30 paintings, and handle expenses and marketing that come with an exhibition. It would also go toward some living expenses while I create. You will be able to follow my creative process on Facebook or samantharochard.blogspot.com or Instagram.</li>
<li>This will also enable me to continue my Friday Finders Keepers Art Drop (persons hunt for a free 5"" x 4"" painting), and begin sending ""awards"" to individuals on the island who make significant community contributions, with little acknowledgement.

<li>Even if I do not reach my entire goal, the completion of less paintings, and group shows are always possible. Or I can begin the process of creating merchandise from the images completed. The Friday Finders Keepers will continue as long as I can.</li>

The project 

Hello there! 
I'm Sally Viganò, and I'm an artist based in Milano. I usually employ printmaking and glass sculpture techniques for my works and one of my project has been selected by PILOTENKUECHE, in Leipzig (Germany), to be developed during an artist-in-residence program! During this 4 months, from June to September 2016, I will focus upon addictions, especially on gambling and electronic devices addiction.  I'd like to use especially printmaking in order to build installations made of small duplicate pieces. This experience in Leipzig will be an amazing chance for me to develop my artistic research in a real professional way! PILOTENCKUECHE is offering me a collaborative space in which to work, access to research communities, technical assistance and so on. 
It is a chance to share ideas, to discuss my work with other specialist, testing the soundness of my artistic projects and its results in an international context. But it will also means living in an other country for four months, working in a rented studio, so I need YOUR help and support, in order to make this chance real! 
What I need 
 

I would like to raise 2000 € in order to cover: 



100% of the cost of the residency (1500 €) 


Part of a low-maintenance room in Leipzig for four months, which is not included in the residency fee. 

Funds raised beyond my goal will be used to fund: 

100% of the cost of the room 
Part of art materials I need to realize the new pieces, such as paper, ink and plates for engraving

I will be very very happy and extremely grateful!

My artistic research
 
The brain and its structure is the most important element in my research. Printmaking, glass sculpture and installation are my favourite techniques and I use them in order to make the brittleness of the mind visible and to investigate the thin border between reason and no-reason, ordinary routine and obsession. 



In particular, I’m meditating on the concept of ‘connectome’, as studied by the neuroscientist Sebastian Seung (if you want you can see a TED conference about it on YouTube!). His slogan is ‘I am my connectome!’. Our identity and our way of being are influenced by our connectome, the network created by the synapsis we all have inside our brains...
But what happen if this connectome is broken? What if connections doesn’t work anymore? What when our gestures becomes automatic, detached from our reason?
Well… I try to make all of these questions visible, studying the moment in which our mind isn’t ‘connected’ anymore.




My goals in Leipzig

During my time in Leipzig, I’d like to take my reaserch to the next step: the concept of addiction. I’ll study the effects that an obsession could have inside our brains, if there are any, and the addictions’ expression through gestures. Installations like Tutto perso or Touch introduce these themes, but being involved in a residency program could give me the change to develop them in a stronger way. 


The main goal will be create realistic 'installation-places' in which one could lose himself, made from small engraved pieces combines together.

The first month would be committed to study gambling and devices addictions through their compulsive gestures, both theoretically and visually. I would like to discuss the theme with other artists-in-residence in order to enlarge printmaking at other media and create a complete work.
During the second month I’d like to test my data, taking advantages of PILOTENKUECHE studios. I would like to experience other printmaking methods, trying to use them in a unconventional way, such as installations instead of traditional drawings in order to create links between different languages.
The third month will be devoted to get the real work done.
Eventually, the fourth month will be focused on the final group exhibition. This moment will be the main one, in which all the works will be shown and judged. 

Why at PILOTENKUECHE?
Because this residence will allow me to work on the concept within an international context! As a Pilot working in this vibrant community I will be able to  discuss my research with other specialists, discussing  addictions also from a social point of view! The residence is a real studio project with special focus on groups dynamic and provides the participants in experimenting with new forms of cooperation in order to improve and expand an independent and strong research. 







Risks & Challenges
  
PILOTENKUECHE has already accepted my project and I have an actual contract with theme. They guarantee to involve me as an artist in many exhibitions during the residence, actively promoting my work. The final event of the residence will be a big group exhibition, with galleries and museums involved in it.
I’ll take this residency as a real work, a sort of “internship”, which is essential to pursue my carrier, so I guarantee for my commitment and for PILOTENKUECHE as well.

Dogs have been a part of my life since my childhood. I have been a professional photographer for 10+ years. I found the perfect marriage between my love of dogs and my passion for photography. It started at home watching and photographing my own dogs. We currently have five dogs our own at home three of which we rescued from shelters. We also have fostered rescue dogs at our home through various organizations and we currently have one foster at home with us now.</li>
<li>Dogs quickly became one of my most frequent subjects for my photography. Over the last several years I discovered I can use my photography to help dogs in shelters. I started photographing dogs our local shelter in 2011 and has take in over 7000 and photos of dogs since then. I donate my time and photographs to the shelter for them to use in their social media in any other publication or promotions they used to advocate for the dogs that are available for adoption. </li>
<li>I have been reaching out to other shelters nearby to see if I can also work with them to use my photography skills to help the dogs at their shelters as well. For a while now I've been searching for a way use my photography to bring more attention to shelter dogs and help promote adoptions and I think this project is a great step in that direction.</li> <li>This project is the best of both worlds for me and brings together arts and animals. This project demonstrates how our can be much more than just something nice to look at it can be something meaningful that has impact on the lives of other living beings in this case the dogs that resided our local shelter. For this project I will work with our local shelter the Chemung County Humane Society and SPCA to photograph the dogs that reside there and then I will select photographs of 10 different dogs to be made and large 20 x 30 prints which will be framed and hung in partnership with the Chemung County Historical Society and put on display as an art exhibit in their museum. </li>
<li>Visitors to the Chemung County historical Society will be able to see the display and will even be able to contribute to the exhibit because they will have the opportunity to write notes or submit photographs by placing them in drop boxes that will be installed with the photograph displays and then those notes and photographs will be on along with the framed artwork that I provide. </li>
<li>This project is so important to me because while I love dogs of any kind there is nothing like impact you can have on a dog's life by being involved with shelter dogs. Shelter dogs often end up at local shelters for reasons that are completely beyond their control and they don't know why they are there or know what may come next for them. If this project can inspire just one person to take some time to go to the local shelter either in our community or where they're from and take a my their day to interact with the shelter dogs and visit them and give them a few moments of happiness that they might not otherwise have or maybe even meet a shelter dog and adopt and take one home then this project will have exceeded my to hopes and dreams for it. </li> <li>Contributors to this project will help me achieve something that I believe is truly great. It will help spread the word of shelter dogs to the wider public. The support of everyone out there will help me use my artwork in a way I have been able to before and move beyond only sharing photographs of shelter dogs online to having a display that will be open to the public where people can see it up close and personal and get a real sense of knowing these dogs. Hopefully being eligible interact with these images of dogs in this way will inspire people to become more involved in their of local shelters and help these dogs who need them.</li>
</ul> </div> <div> <h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3> <ul> <li>The total cost of this project will be $3200. The costs of the project will go into time spent working with the dogs and photographing them at the shelter, reviewing photography, selecting and editing photographs, making decisions on what photograph will be printed delivering photographs for framing, developing material for promotion of the exhibits, costs of advertising the exhibit, travel, and supplies such as the photograph prints themselves, framing material and services, and construction of drop boxes for the exhibit.<br/>
</li> <li>There are great perks available for anyone who decides to contribute to this campaign. There will be digital downloads available in various sizes. There will be prints of various sizes available. There will be exclusive photographs that are not used in the exhibit available that only contributors will have access to. The framed 20 x 30 prints will be available for contributors after the exhibit has completed its run. </li> <li><p>If the project is only partially funded
then expenses for the exhibit will be reduced by cutting back each area of
expenditures by the percentage not received to fully fund the exhibit. Cuts
will be made in a way to avoid changing the exhibit itself if at all possible.
If absolutely necessary the time spent photography dogs will be reduced to
reflect the new level of funding, the number of prints produced and framed will
also be reduced to reflect the new level of funding.</p></li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>The Impact</h3> <ul> <li>I think one goal everybody has their lives is to make an impact on another person in this world. This project gives the contributors a chance to actually accomplish this goal. If you've ever wanted to have an impact on the lives of others this is a great chance to get involved. This exhibit which you will be a part of through your contributions has the potential to change the lives of the people who see it in the way that they view arts and in the way that they view dogs. This exhibit also has the opportunity to change the lives of the animals that exhibit represents. People who view the exhibit and the dogs exhibit is about have a real chance to make a real-world connection that can change the lives of each individual involved and you as a contributor to be the one to make that happen. </li> <li>I have been professional photographer for over 10 years. I have had pieces published in magazines and newspapers. I have had a gallery exhibits. I have sold individual photography pieces at galleries. I have provided services for individuals taking photographs of their dogs and provide them with prints.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <ul> <li>Photographing dogs can be challenging especially if you want to get high quality authentic photographs of dogs fortunately I have been a professional photographer for over 10 years and been involved in photography for 16 years and my experience photographing dogs has its roots in the very first photographs I took when I first began exporting photography. It's an even greater challenge and photographing dogs when you are specifically working with shelter dogs. I've been photographing shelter dog since 2011 in partnership with the Chemung County SPCA and that is the organization I also partnering with for this exhibit. </li>
<li>Another big hurdle for this type of project can often be finding a space for the exhibit to be on display. Fortunately for me I have a commitment from Chemung County Historical Society for a space to have this display and they are donating this space to me for the length of the exhibit. The Chemung County historical Society is also partnering meet with me in making this project reality. So for the two biggest challenges that a project like this presents I am fortunate to be partnering with two great local agencies that are experts in their field and are going to support me in bringing this project our community.</li> </ul> </div> <div> <h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3> <ul> <li>There are other ways you can contribute to this project other than just making a financial contribution. If you want to make an impact you can share this project using the sharing tools available on Indiegogo. If you like what you see please share it anyway you can online, in social media, on whatever platform you have available to you. You can share in your community. You can share it globally you can share it in traditional media in print. You can share with local groups and organizations that you think would be interested in a project like this. Share it with local museums, share it with local shelters, and share with local arts organizations. The power to make this project a success lies with each and every one of you who looks at his campaign and chooses to either contribute financially or through sharing it with other people you know and I appreciate everything you put into making this become reality.<br/>

<h3>Thank you for taking a moment to visit this special campaign. My name is Amanda McLaughlin though my family and close friends call me Storm, a name my Great Grandfather gave me due to my apparent stubborn and head strong nature as a young girl. Today I am more like a gentle spring rain, yet my ambitions are stilI just as loud and rambunctious. I am a visual and performance artist by trade, event coordinator/producer and this year's Programming Producer for a wonderful East Coast Transformational Gathering named Return to Roots. </h3>
<div>A year ago a dear friend and fellow producer ask me to design a sacred temple for her gathering. That day she initiated a secret ambition I had always wished to develop. Due to funding, the design and concept lay sleeping on the pages of my journal until now. Here I am, putting my hopes out there in the great wide open. Here WE are, and I am asking for your participation at bringing this to life and manifesting it into physical form.  </div>
<div>By your generous donation, you are contributing to an intentional transformational sacred experience. My passion has always been providing safe spaces for others to explore their most true authentic selves. Complete support, without judgement, without limitations. I have been developing, volunteering for, and initiating gatherings and events which allow for others to discover for so long. It is time to expand and BUILD A sacred space I can bring to others. Everyone's journey is different. The Temple of Authentic Willful Expression symbolizes that journey and offers permission to discover.</div> <p>The design is already off to the engineers who are also being inspired to embark on a new artistic endeavor which warms me right up! The magic of the Temple of A.W.E  is already alive and doing it's work! </p>
<p>Now down to Business:</p>
<p>Your contribution will assist in materials, payment for collaborators and transporting the structure.</p>
<p>In return for your donation, I have some beautifully personalized perks to offer you.</p>
<p>ONE of my favorite PERKS is this structure will easily be able to be transported and shared. Meaning, once it exists YOU  may be able to use it for your own personal events! Gatherings, festivals, weddings, shows the possibilities are endless...I couldn't possibly keep this all to myself. I have designed it for the specific intention of sharing!  </p>
<p>Other Perks include Free Tickets and Discounts to Our Return to Roots Gathering, so that you may have the opportunity to experience your contribution. I am also excited to be offering a PERK of one of a kind, just for you painting specifically channeled with intention, tailored to a kindred prayer that is intimately yours to cherish for always, or as a future gift to a loved one! </p>
<p>I can't wait to give back in all of these special ways as a means to express my gratitude for your help in making this sacred space come to fruition!</p>
<p></p>

</div></div>","Hello,
Thank you for taking a moment to visit this special campaign. My name is Amanda McLaughlin though my family and close friends call me Storm, a name my Great Grandfather gave me due to my apparent stubborn and head strong nature as a young girl. Today I am more like a gentle spring rain, yet my ambitions are stilI just as loud and rambunctious. I am a visual and performance artist by trade, event coordinator/producer and this year's Programming Producer for a wonderful East Coast Transformational Gathering named Return to Roots. 
A year ago a dear friend and fellow producer ask me to design a sacred temple for her gathering. That day she initiated a secret ambition I had always wished to develop. Due to funding, the design and concept lay sleeping on the pages of my journal until now. Here I am, putting my hopes out there in the great wide open. Here WE are, and I am asking for your participation at bringing this to life and manifesting it into physical form.  
By your generous donation, you are contributing to an intentional transformational sacred experience. My passion has always been providing safe spaces for others to explore their most true authentic selves. Complete support, without judgement, without limitations. I have been developing, volunteering for, and initiating gatherings and events which allow for others to discover for so long. It is time to expand and BUILD A sacred space I can bring to others. Everyone's journey is different. The Temple of Authentic Willful Expression symbolizes that journey and offers permission to discover. The design is already off to the engineers who are also being inspired to embark on a new artistic endeavor which warms me right up! The magic of the Temple of A.W.E  is already alive and doing it's work! 
Now down to Business:
Your contribution will assist in materials, payment for collaborators and transporting the structure.
In return for your donation, I have some beautifully personalized perks to offer you.
ONE of my favorite PERKS is this structure will easily be able to be transported and shared. Meaning, once it exists YOU  may be able to use it for your own personal events! Gatherings, festivals, weddings, shows the possibilities are endless...I couldn't possibly keep this all to myself. I have designed it for the specific intention of sharing!  
Other Perks include Free Tickets and Discounts to Our Return to Roots Gathering, so that you may have the opportunity to experience your contribution. I am also excited to be offering a PERK of one of a kind, just for you painting specifically channeled with intention, tailored to a kindred prayer that is intimately yours to cherish for always, or as a future gift to a loved one! 
I can't wait to give back in all of these special ways as a means to express my gratitude for your help in making this sacred space come to fruition!

All extra funds will be contributed to experience necessary for bringing the Temple of A.W.E as an offering to next years Burning Man in Black Rock City Nevada, There is SO much to learn! I will be attending this year Producing Tedx Black Rock City's event. I am thrilled and cannot wait to hit the playa and connect with other installation artists! 
 I have high ambitions for developing this into a much, much larger and even more eloquent Art Installation in the future. Please help me take the first step manifesting this dream so that others may experience a sacred space to learn, play, trust and grow within.

<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>Once upon a time is a photography exhibition collaborated by a curator and two talented emerging fashion photographers whose works characterized by its ""storytelling"".</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>The Motivation</h3>
<p>The function of photography is always defined as recording, and most of the audiences seem only notice the aesthetic perception of photography, especially fashion photography. We want to explore the possibility of fashion photography - when the model is no longer the main character, and through the medium of an exhibition, we want every series of the work could become fascinating stories and start to communicate with their viewers.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Exhibition</h3>
<p>We would like all our visitors to be able to read the stories inside works and bring meanings to the images by their understanding through the curatorial actives. We want to challenge the traditional photograph exhibiting method of displaying in a ""white cube"", and explore the new way of exhibiting photographies which can stimulate more interacts. For instance, to combine photography and films, and introduce the visual design run through the exhibition hall with the exhibits. </p>
<p> </p>

</p><p><a rel=""noopener nofollow"">My dear family, friends, and fellow travelers… including those of you whom I do not yet
know. I would like to share with you my latest creation, a book called FLY, MY LOVE, FLY. It was created with one purpose, which is to inspire you to
believe that no matter what you are facing, even if it is difficult or
painful, it’s possible to lead your life with joy, meaning, and purpose. </a></p>
<p>Today I live an inspired life. I love the choices I make and I feel
passionate about my path. I have a beautiful sense of purpose and lead a life
of meaning, but it wasn’t always this way. For many years, I thought that I had
missed my calling. Some experiences broke my heart and turned my life upside
down. When I was 29, I experienced a crushing loss. During the birth of my second
child, my daughter, Meah, there were complications. I was fortunate to survive, but unfortunately, my daughter did not. I have never experienced such intense grief before or since.
I felt every negative emotion imaginable for a very long time. I knew that if I
were to survive I would need to learn to navigate the emotional lows and find
my calm in the midst of this storm of grief. </p>
<p>The period of my recovery from this loss was when I decided to become
mindful in a way I’d never before been: to be present and aware of my thoughts,
words, and actions. With practice, I learned how to keep my heart and mind open,
to love bigger, to give more, and to find beauty in places I’d never imagined
it would be possible to find it. And I healed. Through years of deep inner
work, my sadness and pain taught me profound and uplifting lessons. </p><p>During my healing adventure, I accidentally (sort of) became a painter. Many people have told me that my paintings hold an energy they find healing for themselves. I find painting a meditative experience. When I paint I aim to imbue my art with prayers and affirmations. My art holds images of angels and creatures from the sea around the island where I live with my family.</p>
<p>It is my hope that my book of paintings and writings will inspire my readers to dream and take action to create a life that feels good. I hope
that it reminds you that your dreams matter. They’re precious because
they are a part of you. </p>
<p>I would love for all of you to be a part of this creative process with me. There
is an African proverb that says, ""If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want
to go far, go together."" I would love to do this together with all of you, my
family, my friends, and my tribe around the world I’ve yet to meet! You
have all been my support, my inspiration, my reason for doing what I do and you
will continue to be all of this for me. I am grateful beyond measure to you. </p>
<p>My team is in the final stages of laying out and producing FLY, MY LOVE, FLY. All that is
left is for us in September is to print. We are also in the process of creating a workbook of self-reflective exercises that is a companion to planned workshops based on concepts in FLY, MY LOVE, FLY. Our goal is to have both books available by the
end of October 2016. That’s just around the corner. </p>
<p>Funds raised here will be used primarily for the printing of FLY, MY LOVE, FLY and
the  companion workbook. If we are so blessed as to receive more than what is
necessary for printing, excess funds will be applied to marketing and promoting sales of the books. We
expect that the year ahead will be an exciting one with me engaging in lots of travel to various different events to promote books, paintings, and workshops, all geared toward helping people ""fly.""</p>
<p>I appreciate each and every one of you. In whatever way you are able to help, know that I am grateful.
If you are able to give funds through this campaign in return for one of the many
rewards  I’m offering, I will be so very grateful. I hope that you love and
appreciate these offerings as much as I love and appreciate yours. If you are only able
to give by means of positive thoughts and or prayers, please offer those. Anyone who knows me
knows that I appreciate these more than anything else. Finally, if you would be so
kind as to share this campaign page with as many people as you can, that would be amazing! I
thank all of you in advance for taking this next step with me and for being a
part of this new chapter in my life. Going forward with you on my side means everything to me.
Thank you from the bottom of my heart. </p>

Vallejo Art Walk is the largest monthly event in Vallejo California. Vallejo was hit hard first by the Military closing its base at Mare Island and then the recession. The city was forced into bankruptcy soon after. It fell on rough times as many residents moved and others struggled to stay. Many years later the artists started to move into town and create a new art city. <span style=""font-size: medium;letter-spacing: 0px;"">In 2016 Vallejo California is a haven for artists, musicians, and creatives of all types. Vallejo Art Walk has been a big part of this change and we need your help to grow again.</span>
</h3>
<div><span style=""font-size: 16px;""><p>Vallejo Art Walk is a monthly occurrence in the Downtown Vallejo Arts District. Founded in February of 2014 by artist Sean Murdock and a group of artists willing to give it a try. The Vallejo Art Walk soared to a success. It is held on the second Friday of each month rain or shine. It is not officially an event but a group of people that open and set up on the same night to show off their talent. Most locations are in the central core of the downtown and very walkable but a few are spread out a few blocks in each direction.</p>
<p>Vallejo has seen a surge of artists and creatives moving into the area. The art walk is an event to celebrate and encourage the growth of this culture. The event is not affiliated officially with any city group so it is completely independent and dependent on you the art lovers to come support the artists. Without sales of art nobody can build a career in the arts or stay in one area too long. So it is you who will keep this event happening.</p>
<p>We want this to be artists working with artists to create a place they can feel a bond with, and to have a feeling of being a part of the growth. Many so called art areas in America rely to heavily on city money to create their art areas and that leads to only certain acceptable art projects and hand picked favorites getting the spotlight and rising to the top. An art walk is different. The art walk in most cities has been and should be a level playing field for every artist to shine and meet their fans one on one without galleries or cities getting between them for that one night a month. No commissions to pay, no certain image to uphold, no one but the buyer and the artist setting the mood.</p></span></div>

The city was forced into bankruptcy soon after. It fell on rough times as many residents moved and others struggled to stay. Many years later the artists started to move into town and create a new art city. In 2016 Vallejo California is a haven for artists, musicians, and creatives of all types. Vallejo Art Walk has been a big part of this change and we need your help to grow again.

Vallejo Art Walk is a monthly occurrence in the Downtown Vallejo Arts District. Founded in February of 2014 by artist Sean Murdock and a group of artists willing to give it a try. The Vallejo Art Walk soared to a success. It is held on the second Friday of each month rain or shine. It is not officially an event but a group of people that open and set up on the same night to show off their talent. Most locations are in the central core of the downtown and very walkable but a few are spread out a few blocks in each direction.
Vallejo has seen a surge of artists and creatives moving into the area. The art walk is an event to celebrate and encourage the growth of this culture. The event is not affiliated officially with any city group so it is completely independent and dependent on you the art lovers to come support the artists. Without sales of art nobody can build a career in the arts or stay in one area too long. So it is you who will keep this event happening.
We want this to be artists working with artists to create a place they can feel a bond with, and to have a feeling of being a part of the growth. Many so called art areas in America rely to heavily on city money to create their art areas and that leads to only certain acceptable art projects and hand picked favorites getting the spotlight and rising to the top. An art walk is different. The art walk in most cities has been and should be a level playing field for every artist to shine and meet their fans one on one without galleries or cities getting between them for that one night a month. No commissions to pay, no certain image to uphold, no one but the buyer and the artist setting the mood.
   
What We Need  Banners advertising Vallejo Art Walk on the tops of the light poles in downtown Vallejo A frame sign boards to advertise Vallejo Art Walk to traffic in downtown Vallejo as they drive home from San Francisco leaving the ferry plaza.  Any funds over the goal will go to an advertising campaign in local print media and 4""x6"" Flyers 
   The Impact 
We hope to advertise Vallejo Art Walk to more people from outside the downtown Vallejo area. Vallejo has a great art scene now with many artists but the general population is still hesitant to come downtown. With only a small donation last year and 25 dollars a month in Facebook ads we have kept attendance somewhat steady for 2 years.  This added funding and advertising will boost the event and add to the income of the local artists who truly need it by bringing more customers. Artists need patrons or they cannot continue to make art. It is simple, the artists need to sell to a wider crowd and you can make that happen.


    Other Ways You Can Help Some people just can't contribute, but that doesn't mean you can't help:  Ask folks to get the word out and make some noise about this campaign. Use the Indiegogo share tools!
Tell your friends to attend the Vallejo Art Walk and buy some art from local artists.   And that's all there is to it. We need your help!",0.0,0,"4 Campaigns

<h3>Les buts et objectifs de l'académie!</h3>
<p>Tout le monde connait quelqu'un dans son entourage qui pratique des arts martiaux, ou même que vous en apprenez vous aussi. Mais vous êtes-vous déjà demandé si cet apprentissage est complet? Le monde des arts martiaux a énormement évolué au fil de cette dernière décennie, et cette école va être en avant de cette vague!</p>
<p>Le but principal de ce projet est d'avoir un lieu ou chaque individu peut venir apprendre les arts martiaux afin de se découvrir et de devenir la meilleure personne qu'elle puisse être.  Elle va le faire en se démarquant sur 2 points principaux:</p>
<ul>
<li>les cours théoriques (à voir plus bas)</li>

<h3>Les services offerts dans l'académie</h3>
<p>Voici les diverses disciplines offertes dans l'académie:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Jeet Kune Do</strong>: système d'auto-défense crée par le légendaire Bruce Lee. Un système qui regroupe à la base les éléments de Wing Chun, Boxe, et Escrime européenne.</li>
<li>
<strong>Aikido</strong>: système d'auto-défense utilisée par la police Japonaise où le pratiquant utilise la force de son adversaire pour le maitriser.</li>
<li>
<strong>Kickboxing</strong>: sport de combat où les poings et les pieds tombent comme des pluies torrentielles. Une version sportive du Muay Thai.</li>
<li>
<strong>Systema</strong>: art martial russe utilisant la nature du corps humain comme arme de défense contre tout type d'aggression dans tous les environnements possible.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cours d'introduction aux arts martiaux pour enfants</strong>: Cours d'introduction pour les enfants de 5 à 12 ans dans le vaste monde des arts martiaux. Ne s'attachant à aucune discipline précise, ce cours aura pour but de développer les valeurs principales des arts martiaux pour les enfants de jeune âge.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cours privés</strong>: Vous pourrez avoir une entente avec le professeur de votre choix afin d'augmenter la rapidité de votre apprentissage</li>
</ul>
<p>Mais voici là où les choses diffèrent des autres académies d'arts martiaux... Notre établissement offrira aussi des cours théoriques afin de combler les entrainements pratiques. Quand on parle de cours théoriques, on parle des cours de:</p>

<h3>L'évolution constante vers un empire des arts martiaux!</h3>
<p>L'académie sera en évolution constante et voici un autre aspect qui va le différencier des autres écoles. Sa progression ne sera pas décidée par le fondateur ou les professeurs, mais plutôt par les élèves. A travers un simple système de commentaires et suggestions,  l'académie mettra en action la demande des élèves. La progression de toutes les demandes et projets mis en action seront ensuite mis à la vue de tous les membres afin de voir la progression de leur décision.</p>
<p>Ces demandes peuvent toucher n'importe quel domaine de l'école. C'est à dire que les élèves peuvent faire la demande de nouvelles machines d'entrainements, d'une nouvelle configuration d'une salle, de nouvelles disciplines, nouveaux abreuvoirs d'eaux, ou même d'un nouveau type de savon dans les salles de bains! La création et l'évolution de l'académie appartient à ses membres!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Les salles d'entrainements</h3>
<p>Il y aura des salles pour donner des cours d'arts martiaux, ainsi que une grande salle d'entrainement spécifique à la progression de chaque personne. En plus des instruments de musculation de base, il y aura aussi une panoplie énorme d'outils et machine d'entrainements afin de devenir plus fort, rapide, agile, travailler la stabilité, etc, qui n'existent pas encore sur le marché! Cette salle sera toujours accessible aux élèves.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Mais...ca coûte cher tout ca!</h3>
<p>Ce projet coûte énormement de sous à ces débuts. Le but est d'avoir un minimum pour pouvoir commencer, et ensuite aller de l'avant avec ce qu'on a!

<p></p>
<p>Thank you so much for dropping by and checking out my campaign!</p>
<p>I am an avid illustrator who simply loves, you guessed it, to draw. I specialise in ink and brush illustration. In 2013 I got my BFA in Visual Arts from Emily Carr University in Vancouver, Canada and since then I've been living in Helsinki, Finland expanding my art practice. I love drawing all my favourite dinosaurs, movie, comic and t.v. characters.</p>
<p>My passion for drawing came from watching my grandad sketching landscapes and portraits. Every time he visited us he showed me how to use watercolours, charcoal and other mediums. From all of them I liked watercolour and pencil drawing the most. I slowly started developing my own techniques using ink. Now, I can't let go of my brush and my ink flask. I carry them everywhere I go. I spend hours and hours, day and night drawing. My hobby for drawing became my passion and now I am so happy to say that it has become my profession.  </p>
<p></p>
<p><b>The Campaign:</b></p>

<p>My goal is to raise enough funds to be able to travel to this year's Stan Lee's Comikaze 2016 in Los Angeles, California and have the opportunity to exhibit my work at the Artist's Alley where I will have the opportunity to create and expand my professional network, meet enthusiastic fans as well as to talk people from the industry.</p>

<h2>What is MIGHTY?</h2>
<p><i>MIGHTY will be the first art installation brought to Playa by the People of Color Camp. You can find it at the entrance of our camp at 8:00 and Rod's Road.</i></p>
<p>This year’s Burning Man theme I, Robot asks us to consider the important positions robots and artificial intelligence have taken in our lives. While doing so, we must not leapfrog over the still unrealized acknowledgement of humanity for people of color in our society. MIGHTY is an exploration of what it would look like for radical inclusion to be applied to people of color. </p>
<p>Initial ideas for MIGHTY began by reflecting on the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr's assassination and Afrofuturism.</p>
<p>On April 3rd, 1968 in Memphis, TN, Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his last speech “I've Been to the Mountaintop” in support of the ongoing Sanitation Workers Strike. Eleven days after the deaths of Echol Cole and Robert Walker, 1,300 black sanitation workers and their supporters protested the abusive working conditions, racism, and discrimination by the city. The “I Am a Man” sandwich board posters worn by protesters served as an affirmation against oppression and became the resounding theme of the strike. </p>
<p>MIGHTY serves as a reminder that we must continue to struggle for the full inclusion for people of color in all spaces. Informed by our history we look to the future and will create a platform to uplift each other towards the brilliance of our individual and collective power. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531771974/avnklx6wrpj6thfqplvw.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We envision a future where all people can participate in their fullest expression both on and off Playa. Our observation platform seeks to be a space for elevating people in general and people of color in particular towards a future that allows us all to show up in our full beauty, humanity, and might. We want this to be a space where you can be as you are without the masks we need to wear for our everyday survival.</p>
<h2>Designing &amp; Constructing MIGHTY</h2>
<p>MIGHTY will be made of 3 tiers with a footprint of 30' x 20' x 8'.  Each tier invites you to commune with one another and wonder about the might within you. The third tier will have two wicker thrones, a telescope and the entrance to the slide for a quick return to the ground level. At night the MIGHTY will be illuminated from beneath the structure in a warm white light. </p>
<p>Our San Francisco POC Camp family will host our test build in early August where we will prefabricate all the parts needed to successfully build MIGHTY on Playa.</p>

Returning to Burning Man for her 3rd time, Gina is thrilled to interact with people and art that continuously push the boundaries of human experiences. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531593906/k2unejsycbftbl5xmzan.jpg"" src=""""/><br/>First-time burner, <strong>Adrian Lu</strong> (SF,CA) fully embraces the principles of Burning Man and immediately jumped into this project by leading the architectural planning for MIGHTY. Attracted by the endless ways in which humanity can be deeply explored on Playa, Adrian looks forward to engaging with art that calls into question and challenges that which is accepted as normal. Working on MIGHTY has allowed him to explore the art of architecture and engineering and pushes the boundaries of what he can do in his own work. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531764553/hccrcrytuhqi5t5ng64t.jpg"" src=""""/><br/><b>Marlon Williams</b> (BK, NY) makes his 7th year Burning Man return to connect with community and the sense of joy, wonder, and ritual the Playa provides. He chose to work on this project because he wants to live in a world of radical inclusion, where all people, particularly people of color, are free to express themselves and achieve their highest potential. This project creates the space to glimpse that future so that we can feel energized to change and resist our present reality.  </p>
<h2>Your Donations are MIGHTY</h2>
<p><strong>MIGHTY Materials = $4,500</strong><br/>Plywood, 2 x 4's, washers, nuts, bolts, hex bolts, paint, fabric, lighting, wicker thrones, and a telescope are just some of the items MIGHTY needs to be a safe and spectacular structure. </p>
<p><strong>MIGHTY Transportation = $1000</strong><br/>MIGHTY needs get from San Francisco to Burning Man. That involves renting a van for 2 weeks, gas, and insurance. </p>
<p><strong>MIGHTY Storage= $500</strong><br/>After materials and transportation are taken care of any remaining funds will go towards MIGHTY's new home. MIGHTY will live in a storage unit in Reno</p>
</div><div>
<h2>MIGHTY Impact</h2>
<p>For a variety of reasons people of color attend Burning Man in very few numbers. MIGHTY will serve as a beacon to signal our growing presence on Playa. We wish to express to those that have been on the fence about attending Burning Man that there is a community of people that looks just like them available to support them as they take the leap and prepare to journey to Black Rock City. </p>

Initial ideas for MIGHTY began by reflecting on the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr's assassination and Afrofuturism.
On April 3rd, 1968 in Memphis, TN, Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his last speech “I've Been to the Mountaintop” in support of the ongoing Sanitation Workers Strike. Eleven days after the deaths of Echol Cole and Robert Walker, 1,300 black sanitation workers and their supporters protested the abusive working conditions, racism, and discrimination by the city. The “I Am a Man” sandwich board posters worn by protesters served as an affirmation against oppression and became the resounding theme of the strike. 
MIGHTY serves as a reminder that we must continue to struggle for the full inclusion for people of color in all spaces. Informed by our history we look to the future and will create a platform to uplift each other towards the brilliance of our individual and collective power. 

We envision a future where all people can participate in their fullest expression both on and off Playa. Our observation platform seeks to be a space for elevating people in general and people of color in particular towards a future that allows us all to show up in our full beauty, humanity, and might. We want this to be a space where you can be as you are without the masks we need to wear for our everyday survival.
Designing & Constructing MIGHTY
MIGHTY will be made of 3 tiers with a footprint of 30' x 20' x 8'.  Each tier invites you to commune with one another and wonder about the might within you. The third tier will have two wicker thrones, a telescope and the entrance to the slide for a quick return to the ground level. At night the MIGHTY will be illuminated from beneath the structure in a warm white light. 
Our San Francisco POC Camp family will host our test build in early August where we will prefabricate all the parts needed to successfully build MIGHTY on Playa.
About POC Camp

 
 
 
 
 
 
Founded in 2013 by Nicholas Powers, People of Color Camp is a Melanin kaleidoscope where all hues, all colors, all nations, all religions, and all gender identities are welcome to express their visions. We invite dreams sprung from every corner of the Earth, especially dreams outside of America and those suppressed within it.
POC Camp is an intentional tribe with an eye on recreating our Playa family in the real world.  A living experiment in creating a family outside America’s socioeconomic defaults. We are a foundation for a peaceful future. Come and build with us!

The MIGHTY Team
Gina Tedesco (BX, NY) is known to wear many hats all in the name of getting $#!t done. She became MIGHTY's lead artist when it was suggested that POC Camp should have an observation platform. Being part of the talented team to help bring to Playa POC Camp's first art piece is beyond anything she imagined when she first arrived at Black Rock City in 2015. Returning to Burning Man for her 3rd time, Gina is thrilled to interact with people and art that continuously push the boundaries of human experiences. 
First-time burner, Adrian Lu (SF,CA) fully embraces the principles of Burning Man and immediately jumped into this project by leading the architectural planning for MIGHTY. Attracted by the endless ways in which humanity can be deeply explored on Playa, Adrian looks forward to engaging with art that calls into question and challenges that which is accepted as normal. Working on MIGHTY has allowed him to explore the art of architecture and engineering and pushes the boundaries of what he can do in his own work. 
Marlon Williams (BK, NY) makes his 7th year Burning Man return to connect with community and the sense of joy, wonder, and ritual the Playa provides. He chose to work on this project because he wants to live in a world of radical inclusion, where all people, particularly people of color, are free to express themselves and achieve their highest potential. This project creates the space to glimpse that future so that we can feel energized to change and resist our present reality.  
Your Donations are MIGHTY
MIGHTY Materials = $4,500Plywood, 2 x 4's, washers, nuts, bolts, hex bolts, paint, fabric, lighting, wicker thrones, and a telescope are just some of the items MIGHTY needs to be a safe and spectacular structure. 
MIGHTY Transportation = $1000MIGHTY needs get from San Francisco to Burning Man. That involves renting a van for 2 weeks, gas, and insurance. 
MIGHTY Storage= $500After materials and transportation are taken care of any remaining funds will go towards MIGHTY's new home. MIGHTY will live in a storage unit in Reno

MIGHTY Impact
For a variety of reasons people of color attend Burning Man in very few numbers. MIGHTY will serve as a beacon to signal our growing presence on Playa. We wish to express to those that have been on the fence about attending Burning Man that there is a community of people that looks just like them available to support them as they take the leap and prepare to journey to Black Rock City. 
Shoutouts!
A HUGE thank you to each and every single person who has backed our campaign. Your support brings us closer to making this project a reality. Special shoutouts to POC Camp for letting three people run freely with the idea of an observation platform, Living Cities for contributing to the thought behind this project, H. Scott Roth and 43.60 Studio for their video production, SilkyBlack for his music, Nathalie Larosiliere for bringing our perks to life, and Justin Shirley for adjusting our images.",5.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>The Project</h3>
<p>My name is Chantel Schultz and I am an emerging visual artist in Edmonton, Alberta. I have recently graduated from the University of Alberta with a Bachelor of Fine Arts and have been invited to Salem Art Works as a Young Artist Intern in Salem, NY from May 30 - July 19. I am inviting you to support my project because this opportunity will provide me with access to studio space, networking with other artists, and the uninterrupted time to propel my studio practice as a young emerging artist.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556559688/rbqivgqxplodudt4hye2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As an artist intern at Salem Art Works, I will be responsible for assisting with the daily operations of SAW which include general maintenance of the facilities, assisting with events and exhibitions, and execution of a special project. In exchange for my contributions, I will be provided with room and board, access to studio space, technical support and a complimentary workshop. While at SAW, I have been invited to participate in an outdoor sculpture exhibition at North Bennington Sculpture Park in North Bennington, VT. The sculpture will be on exhibition from June 26 - November 2. </p>
<p>This internship will provide me with room and board but it will not cover travel or material expenses; so I have launched my campaign for $2,650 to cover travel, material and additional living costs. Contributions to this campaign will also help to support the expenses of materials for an outdoor sculpture. As a contributor to this campaign, you will receive original artworks in the form of sculptures, drawings, prints and artwork packages. </p>
<p><strong>Contributors will receive:</strong></p>
<p>Virtual High Five in the form of a GIF, postcards, illustrated kombucha starter kits, small cement sculptures, original drawings, silicone sculptures, prints, nylon sculptures or a discounted artist package.</p>

<p>Lodging = $180</p>
<p>Living costs = $500</p>
<p>Materials = $500</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Your contribution will allow me to travel 4,000 km to this internship! It will also provide me with the materials I need to continue making work to develop my artistic practice.</p>
<p>Residencies and internships provide artists with access to specialized resources, opportunities to exhibit work, offer uninterrupted time and space to develop artistic practice and provide opportunities to connect with other artists in varying stages of their careers.  This internship will provide me with the resources I need to sustain the forward momentum I have cultivated in my final year of the Bachelor of Fine Arts program.</p>
<p>As an emerging artist, it is important that I dedicate myself to establish a routine of working, to expand my connection with other artists, and to build confidence in my practice. As a recent graduate, I have limited assets and resources. I will have to be resourceful with the materials I acquire and seek alternative ways to cover travel and additional living expenses. </p>
<p>With financial relief, this campaign will provide me with the stability and energy I need to further develop a healthy studio practice in a space that affords me the time to do so. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>I will be driving the 4,000 km trek from Edmonton, AB to Salem, NY in order to bring tools and materials to work. The road trip will take me through Alberta, Saskatchewan, North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pensylvania, and New York with major stops in Minneapolis, Chicago, and Cleveland. My car is 12 years old and has been very reliable but travelling this distance may wear it down resulting in unforeseen vehicle hiccups and travel delays. To remedy this, I will need to budget for an emergency fund in case of repair or maintenance and may need support from friends in the United States to provide a safe stop along the way. </p>

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Trude Sojka was born in Berlin, in 1909, from Czech-Jewish parents. She studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Berlin, with the most prestigious teachers of the avant-garde movements of the 1920-1930's. When the war came, she went through at least 4 concentration camps.</p>
<p>In 1946, after surviving the Holocaust, Trude Sojka emigrated to Ecuador to join her only remaining brother. There, she established herself as an artist, depicting her experience during the war, but also providing a message of peace and hope through her original paintings and sculptures, made out of Portland cement and recycled materials. Eleven years after her death, the Terezin Memorial in the Czech Republic (Sojka's family was deported to the Terezin Ghetto), has invited her family to exhibit her artworks, from March to June 2019. The theme is ""Being a Woman and a Holocaust Survivor"", or ""Holocaust and Maternity"", because Sojka gave birth and lost her first child in one of the concentration camps.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541203963/xbvok0mjew78nnj6tca9.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Her daughter (Anita Steinitz) and grand-daughter (Gabriela Steinitz), Director and President of the Trude Sojka Cultural House Corporation in Ecuador, a non-profit cultural foundation, as keepers of her legacy, are trying to make this exhibit abroad come true.</p>
<p>Indeed,Trude Sojka never returned back to her beloved Czech Republic, but we know it would have been one of her most desired wishes. Most of all, we think it is very important to promote her life-story as a symbol of hope and resilience, as many Holocaust survivors who emigrated to Ecuador, and of many Jewish artists who depicted something different from the horrors of the war. Furthermore, for us, this exhibit should act as a cultural bridge, to show that a country as small as Ecuador, with a very special cultural background, can achieve international recognition.<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541203532/tlduo6fgntgqzwxymcep.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>As a non-profit organization, with almost no income, we need to collect funds to finance the shipping and insurance of these valuable and very heavy paintings and sculptures from Quito to Terezin, which will cost about 20 000 dollars.</p>
<p>Besides, we need to pay our trip to the Czech Republic and back to Ecuador, as well  as our stay in Europe, amounting to, at least, 4 000 dollars,</p>
<p>The Terezin Memorial will help us with the exhibit hall and the installation, as well as with publicity and refreshments for the opening.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>We sincerely believe in the power of culture. Artists can transmit a lot more than their feelings, they can radically change prejudices or bring more conscience to other human beings. Transmission involves as well movement, that means the circulation of art through the world. How great it is, for example, to be able to see a Cézanne or to discover a new artist in our own country! How great it is also to know that an artist returns to her country of origin, to her home, even posthumously! How interesting to know that there has been a fusion of cultures (the Ecuadorian and the Czech cultures). What a nice and well deserved act of recognition to a Holocaust survivor!</p>
<p>If we do not reach the goal of 24 000 dollars, the project will fail, and who knows when we will have another opportunity to make this expected exhibit.</p>

<h3><strong>The Impact</strong></h3>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<p>Your help is extremely valuable to us, and perhaps, you too, will be able to appreciate these artworks.</p>
<p>Your generosity will be contributing to universal culture and helping to connect two continents, to keep the memory of the Shoah, in order to prevent other genocides of this type. You will be helping to make the message of peace travel around the world!</p>

</div><div>
<p>We don't want this project to begin and then simply end. We want to open its borderlines, so it can be the first step of a worldwide traveling exhibit, throughout Europe, Israel, United-Stated, and more. Perhaps, with your valuable help, one day it could arrive to your country, city or town!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> The artworks need to be packed inside hard-covered wooden boxes, carried by air and land providing the maximal care and security, until they reach the town of Terezin.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Anita and Gabriela Steinitz need to prepare the printing material, texts, documents, etc. for the exhibit, and plan their trip in order to arrive in Czech Republic beginning March 2019.</p>
<p>If the necessary sum is not collected before January 2019, the whole project will need to be cancelled. We hope that your donation at Indiegogo will help us on time.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1541205237/adwnibmmjijhmnhfcvus.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
</div><div>
<p>Moreover, discrimination, violence and hatred continue to happen in the world every day. The right-wing, white-supremacy politics around the world is very frightening.</p>
<p>Many people believe that Trude Sojka's art can be is part of counter-acting that. So this could the perfect occasion to reminds us about the terror that hate can bring, and transmit the message of survivors like Trude Sojka.</p>

Trude Sojka was born in Berlin, in 1909, from Czech-Jewish parents. She studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Berlin, with the most prestigious teachers of the avant-garde movements of the 1920-1930's. When the war came, she went through at least 4 concentration camps.
In 1946, after surviving the Holocaust, Trude Sojka emigrated to Ecuador to join her only remaining brother. There, she established herself as an artist, depicting her experience during the war, but also providing a message of peace and hope through her original paintings and sculptures, made out of Portland cement and recycled materials. Eleven years after her death, the Terezin Memorial in the Czech Republic (Sojka's family was deported to the Terezin Ghetto), has invited her family to exhibit her artworks, from March to June 2019. The theme is ""Being a Woman and a Holocaust Survivor"", or ""Holocaust and Maternity"", because Sojka gave birth and lost her first child in one of the concentration camps.
Her daughter (Anita Steinitz) and grand-daughter (Gabriela Steinitz), Director and President of the Trude Sojka Cultural House Corporation in Ecuador, a non-profit cultural foundation, as keepers of her legacy, are trying to make this exhibit abroad come true.
Indeed,Trude Sojka never returned back to her beloved Czech Republic, but we know it would have been one of her most desired wishes. Most of all, we think it is very important to promote her life-story as a symbol of hope and resilience, as many Holocaust survivors who emigrated to Ecuador, and of many Jewish artists who depicted something different from the horrors of the war. Furthermore, for us, this exhibit should act as a cultural bridge, to show that a country as small as Ecuador, with a very special cultural background, can achieve international recognition.

 
What We Need & What You Get
As a non-profit organization, with almost no income, we need to collect funds to finance the shipping and insurance of these valuable and very heavy paintings and sculptures from Quito to Terezin, which will cost about 20 000 dollars.
Besides, we need to pay our trip to the Czech Republic and back to Ecuador, as well  as our stay in Europe, amounting to, at least, 4 000 dollars,
The Terezin Memorial will help us with the exhibit hall and the installation, as well as with publicity and refreshments for the opening.
 
We sincerely believe in the power of culture. Artists can transmit a lot more than their feelings, they can radically change prejudices or bring more conscience to other human beings. Transmission involves as well movement, that means the circulation of art through the world. How great it is, for example, to be able to see a Cézanne or to discover a new artist in our own country! How great it is also to know that an artist returns to her country of origin, to her home, even posthumously! How interesting to know that there has been a fusion of cultures (the Ecuadorian and the Czech cultures). What a nice and well deserved act of recognition to a Holocaust survivor!
If we do not reach the goal of 24 000 dollars, the project will fail, and who knows when we will have another opportunity to make this expected exhibit.

The Impact

 
Your help is extremely valuable to us, and perhaps, you too, will be able to appreciate these artworks.
Your generosity will be contributing to universal culture and helping to connect two continents, to keep the memory of the Shoah, in order to prevent other genocides of this type. You will be helping to make the message of peace travel around the world!


We don't want this project to begin and then simply end. We want to open its borderlines, so it can be the first step of a worldwide traveling exhibit, throughout Europe, Israel, United-Stated, and more. Perhaps, with your valuable help, one day it could arrive to your country, city or town!
 
Risks & Challenges
 The artworks need to be packed inside hard-covered wooden boxes, carried by air and land providing the maximal care and security, until they reach the town of Terezin.
Meanwhile, Anita and Gabriela Steinitz need to prepare the printing material, texts, documents, etc. for the exhibit, and plan their trip in order to arrive in Czech Republic beginning March 2019.
If the necessary sum is not collected before January 2019, the whole project will need to be cancelled. We hope that your donation at Indiegogo will help us on time.


Moreover, discrimination, violence and hatred continue to happen in the world every day. The right-wing, white-supremacy politics around the world is very frightening.
Many people believe that Trude Sojka's art can be is part of counter-acting that. So this could the perfect occasion to reminds us about the terror that hate can bring, and transmit the message of survivors like Trude Sojka.
 
Other Ways You Can Help

<h3>Dream Control – The Book</h3>
<p>An art project and book, featuring staged photography, miniature film sets, an Oscar-winning actor (and many more), elucidating texts about a possible future: Explore a story of lucid dreamers and sleepwalkers venturing in an amusement park, run by a shady corporation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Produced by Frank Lassak and the team of Efacts Photography,<br/>in cooperation with Musée de cinéma et miniature, Lyon</li>
<li>Contains museum-quality reproductions of 20 large-scale staged photographs, produced on film, showing the simulated world of an amusement park for sleepwalkers. For the pictures, the museum gave exclusive permission to use selected miniatures from its collection</li>
<li>With accompanying texts (in English, French and German), such as an essay by Julius Deutschbauer and Sina Klein, a fictional story about the future of tailor-made dreaming, and a detailed description of the project and its scientific and philosophical background<br/> </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Story</h3>
<p>Dream Control describes and visualizes both the fascinating and terrifying aspects of an amusement park for sleepwalkers, which – as closer inspection reveals – is a front for a dubious organization, whose true motives are unknown. As such, the book is an invitation for the readers to scrutinize the value and integrity of allegedly life-enhancing services, whose sole purpose is to jeopardize the clients’ ability to lead a self-determined, sovereign life.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>For the first print-run of 150 copies, an investment of approx. 5,000 € is needed</p>
<ul>
<li>20% of this amount comes from our own budget; the remaining 80% (4,000 €) would be crowdfunded.</li>
<li>In return for your support, and depending on the amount you're willing to invest, there are various perks available – from signed copies of the book to limited art prints and more.</li>
<li>If this campaign ends short of 100% of the goal, we will use the accumulated total for a smaller print-run. Thus, your investment will serve a great purpose in any case.</li>
<li>If more than 100% of the campaign goal are coming in, the print-run will be expanded proportionately.<br/><br/> </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>There is virtually no financial risk to this project: the first edition will be printed, regardless of how much money will be gathered in this campaign. The idea is to be able to make a larger print-run, so as to reduce the cost per copy of the book – which makes it more attractive to buy for those who are interested in the subject.</p>
<p>Depending on how much money is gathered in this campaign, the following number of copies will be printed:</p>
<ul>
<li>less than 1,000 €: 30 copies</li>
<li>1,000 € to 2,000 €: 50 copies</li>
<li>2,000 € to 3,000 €: 100 copies</li>
<li>more than 3,000 €: 150 copies<br/> </li>
</ul>
<h3>Sales &amp; Distribution</h3>
<p>The book will be distributed through regular book shops, at the Musée de cinéma et miniatures in Lyon/France, and in art and media outlets throughout Europe. Estimated selling price: 70 €</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>In case you're unable to support this project financially, we would be very grateful if you spread the word about this campaign and share it with your contacts on social media or wherever.<br/>Thank you so much – and sweet dreams!</p>

<h3>Who We Are</h3>
<p>I am a proud member of a  team comprised of individuals who bring their passion for creativity to the conception and realization of unique ideas in the fields of tarot/oracle art and tarot/oracle publishing. Each one of us is an established researcher/professional in their area, and in 2017 we decided to integrate our creative efforts into an enterprise that strives for inventiveness and novelty.  </p>
<p>We started the campaign for the Lenormand-Solitaire Set in order to finally achieve the realization of a great idea - the derivation of a unique Solitaire deck from the images of a traditional Lenormand card set, and the unlocking of the novel possibilities for readings residing in the particular combination.</p>
<h3>What Does the Lenormand-Solitaire Set Contain</h3>
<ul>
<li>A 36-card Lenormand Deck</li>
<li>An 18-card Lenormand-Solitaire Deck</li>
<li>A Booklet with reading scenarios for practice purposes</li>
<li>A specially designed box</li>
</ul>
<p>The <i>Lenormand-Solitaire+ Edition</i> additionally includes a beautiful table cloth that can be used for card spreads.</p>
<h3>What Makes our Lenormand-Solitaire Set Unique</h3>
<p>Our deck is no less exceptional in its attention to detail and the beauty of its illustrations than the most celebrated decks internationally. We strive passionately for artistry and quality, and we are particularly proud of the amazing illustrations of this deck.</p>

<p>What makes this deck truly unique is:</p>

<li>The innovative idea to generate an 18-card solitaire deck from the 36 images of its Lenormand counterpart</li>
<li>Each of the 18 Lenormand-Solitaire cards is comprised of four parts, and every such part carries a fragment from the images of the Lenormand deck</li>
<li>The possibilities arising from this innovative idea are intriguing since the particular layout of the Lenormand-Solitaire cards allows for multiple combination schemes - thus, for additional interpretations (watch the video below)</li>

<h3>About Audrey &amp; The Story Behind the Project....</h3>
<p>I’m Audrey Phillips—a twenty-four year old graduate from Bowdoin College with a degree in Earth &amp; Oceanographic Science and Education. I grew up in Seattle, WA and am an avid doodler, outdoor enthusiast, and aspiring therapist. I’m the youngest of four siblings, which fostered my ability to be an observer and empathetic listener from a young age—I’ve been told time after time that listening to others is my greatest strength and I’ve continued to foster my listening abilities throughout my different job experiences as a guide in the outdoors.</p>
<p>I worked as a wilderness therapy guide in Durango, CO where I took at-risk students ages 13 to 29 years old backpacking for eight days in the Utah desert—and my favorite part of the job was creating emotionally safe spaces for students to share their incredibly powerful stories with such vulnerability and strength. I used these 365 Meaningful Conversation Cards in the field with students was blown away by the conversations I was able to stimulate with students—for example, a group of 18-20 year old men talked about their relationship with their body image and the difficulties around “being a man,” yet wanting to be feminine as well. That’s just one of many vulnerable conversations that was sparked and I learned that humans crave a space to connect deeply, yet the space is very rarely opened up. Overall, my professional experiences allowed me to practice holding space for people sharing vulnerably and listening with an open mind &amp; heart.</p>
<p>I’ve also learned in my personal life the power of sharing vulnerably. The biggest struggle I’ve endured in my life is being sexually assaulted right before heading to college and I didn’t tell anyone about my story for years—instead I sat alone in silence and shame, until my last year of college when I took a leap of vulnerability and wrote about my experience with sexual assault for my college newspaper. I felt exposed, raw and nervous when it was sent all across my campus, but I ended up receiving so many messages from people I’d never even met before telling me that my story was courageous and let others feel less alone. It was a turning point for me—I realized that sharing vulnerably opened me up to connect deeply with others as my authentic self, instead of hiding part of me. After that experience I knew that my calling in the world was to create a way for others to share vulnerably and connect deeply.</p>

<li>Backed in 2017, I raised funds to tour a mobile VR gallery across North America. That was wild.

<h3>MY EXPERIENCES WITH OAXACA</h3>
<p>Here's a quick recounting of my sordid love affair with Oaxaca:</p>
<ul>
<li>As part of my North American bus tour, I drove down into Mexico in January 2017 to engage with Mexican audiences and to escape being in the US for the inauguration out of sheer embarrassment.</li>
<li>On a whim, I stopped in Oaxaca City and fell in looooove.</li>
<li>In fact, I fell so hard that I went back in July 2017 for an artist residency at Obracadobra (<a href=""http://www.obracadobra.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.obracadobra.com</a>). During this residency, I created a VR experience called ""Las Olas"" -- I call it a life cycle fever dream, and it features photography and voice from Lizette Flores (Oax) and music from Cages (Buffalo) and is in both Spanish and English.</li>
<li>I then went back to my bus lifestyle and came back to Oaxaca in October 2017 to exhibit ""Las Olas"" at San Pablo -- a 16th century Dominican convent turned arts space.</li>
<li>I'm planning on heading back this June to work with a team of artists to produce a new VR piece that is going to be dark and scary and intense and is giving me nightmares already. I'm hoping to premiere this piece during Dia de los Muertos 2018, and to leave the piece running to generate additional revenue for this new lab.</li>

With your purchase of a print I will be able to achieve my goals for this coming year and to significantly build upon my recent success.While we've been locked down over the last few months  I've been productively making drawings for this print edition (images of which you can see below) and preparing the drawings, designs and digital files for my textile-works. These works will be an extension of the rugs seen in the attached video and images below. It's my intention however for these new pieces to be wall works rather than rugs this time.Each of the five prints created for this fundraiser is an edition of twenty, signed and numbered on German etching paper, size 29"" x 22"" and priced at $475 CDN each ($350 USD)All funds raised for this project will go directly to production expenses, which I hope to start in fall.   Southbank #1, pigment print on German etching paper 29"" x 22"" 2020  Ihoan,  pigment print on German etching paper 29"" x 22"" 2020  Brasilia,  pigment print on German etching paper 29"" x 22"" 2020  Southbank #5,  pigment print on German etching paper 29"" x 22"" 2020  At Night All Cats Are Grey,  pigment print on German etching paper 29"" x 22"" 2020 Portfolio editions of 2-5 works are also available 2 works - $900 CDN      ($665 USD)3 works - $1350 CDN   ($995USD)4 works - $1750 CDN   ($1290 USD)5 works - $ 2200 CDN   ($1620 USD)Free shipping within Canada Grands Ensemble 1.1 and 1.2 hand-dyed, hand-tufted and hand-carved 100% New Zealand, for for Urban Fabric, Shanghai.",10.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>The ""Stations of the Cross"" are traditionally a series of art pieces chronicling 14 of the last events leading to Jesus' death. They are meant to help us get a fuller understanding of Jesus' suffering on Good Friday. I've been drawing and animating Christian mandalas, which I've found to be helpful in Christian meditation. I think the Christian Church needs more relevant multi-media to help it compete with the emotional power of secular modern media.</p>
<p>There are a couple of reasons to do this project as an IndieGoGo. As an IndieGoGo I can begin marketing and selling the mandalas before they are all completed, which gives us adequate time to spread awareness by Good Friday 2020. It also makes a good IndieGoGo project because it will help to have donations to fund this project, as I will have to prioritize this over other paying projects. And also because perhaps this is a cause you would want to support!</p>

<h3>What You'll get</h3>

<li><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">By funding the project at any level you'll be allowing me to make a video to give away for free to any church, group, or individual to watch on Good Friday, 2020. The video would be a little over an hour, and would be meant to deepen our understanding of Jesus' suffering through meditative, rich animation.  </span></li>
<li>You can purchase one, some, or all of the Stations in poster form. They would be printed on 13""x19"" thick paper. I will send them to you as posters in a poster tube with hanging instructions.</li>

My name is Melanie and I'm a German-Filipina visual artist, currently based on Boracay Island in the Philippines. My journey has taken me to many places: I was born in Germany, grew up in Spain, studied in the UK, lived and taught art in Thailand and the US, and just recently moved back to my home base in the Philippines.</p><p>Through my art practice, I try to explore local and forgotten histories using overlooked surfaces. I am a painter by training, known for my use of driftwood found on the shores of the Philippine islands. </p><p>Over the past few years, I've been particularly interested in the cultural links and shared history of Mexico and the Philippines via the galleon trade. </p><p>Check out my recent work on this topic on my website: <a href=""http://www.gritzkadelvillar.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.gritzkadelvillar.com/</a></p><p> which leads to....</p><p> </p><h3><strong>The reason for this crowdfunding campaign!</strong></h3><p>I'm super excited to share with you that I am one of only two artists (out of more than 200 applicants!) who has been one of two artists selected to do an artist-in-residence program at the Leonora Carrington Museum in San Luís Potosí in Mexico this fall! </p><p>This is an amazing and once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me to spend three months (from mid August to mid November this year) at the Leonora Carrington Museum to develop a research-based art project. </p><p>My time at the museum will culminate with a solo exhibition of my works and findings in one of the museums temporary exhibition spaces. The exhibition will launch in November 2019 and will run until February 2020.</p><p>See some images of the museum: </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560272139/pyed317w9u0jiozyuehc.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560270756/klggkmtfvapjzn1lvvsu.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p>as well as the space designated to my exhibition:</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560271177/vxkpaeopmt1otdfe39eg.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><h3><strong>What the Project is about</strong></h3><p>Using the museum as base to work from, I will be able to explore some of the old mining towns in and around San Luís Potosí. These mining towns formed part of the old trade routes between Spain, Mexico and the Philippines. I want to visit some of these ""ghost towns"" and see how the gold and silver mining industry has impacted the remaining local communities. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1560273503/ngzonttl1lpwkv9nnl5t.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>What traces remain of the mining industry in the local community?

My name is Melanie and I'm a German-Filipina visual artist, currently based on Boracay Island in the Philippines. My journey has taken me to many places: I was born in Germany, grew up in Spain, studied in the UK, lived and taught art in Thailand and the US, and just recently moved back to my home base in the Philippines.Through my art practice, I try to explore local and forgotten histories using overlooked surfaces. I am a painter by training, known for my use of driftwood found on the shores of the Philippine islands. Over the past few years, I've been particularly interested in the cultural links and shared history of Mexico and the Philippines via the galleon trade. Check out my recent work on this topic on my website: http://www.gritzkadelvillar.com/ which leads to.... The reason for this crowdfunding campaign!I'm super excited to share with you that I am one of only two artists (out of more than 200 applicants!) who has been one of two artists selected to do an artist-in-residence program at the Leonora Carrington Museum in San Luís Potosí in Mexico this fall! This is an amazing and once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for me to spend three months (from mid August to mid November this year) at the Leonora Carrington Museum to develop a research-based art project. My time at the museum will culminate with a solo exhibition of my works and findings in one of the museums temporary exhibition spaces. The exhibition will launch in November 2019 and will run until February 2020.See some images of the museum:   as well as the space designated to my exhibition: What the Project is aboutUsing the museum as base to work from, I will be able to explore some of the old mining towns in and around San Luís Potosí. These mining towns formed part of the old trade routes between Spain, Mexico and the Philippines. I want to visit some of these ""ghost towns"" and see how the gold and silver mining industry has impacted the remaining local communities. What traces remain of the mining industry in the local community? What remains of the indigenous cultures today and in what form? It will be interesting to uncover a more local and indigenous voice in contrast to the ""official"" history. Project goalThe goal of my project is to work together with the local communities to help give visual expression and a voice to some of their personal as well as mythological stories they may have from the past. The final exhibition will most likely be in the form of an art installation, mixed media works, and have a video component.Moreover, as part of the residency, I will be able to share my findings and process with the public in the form of an artist talk at the museum. This is ever so exciting!!This residency is really a dream come true: it will allow me to work on the ground with local communities, gather important data on my research topic, and develop my own art practice within the beautiful setting of the museum whilst getting inspired by Leonora Carrington's works! The CatchHowever: the reality of executing a 3-month long art project involves quite a bit of money. This is because, although the museum offers me accommodation during my stay, I will still need to cover all the other expenses for the time I'm in Mexico as well as all production costs of the final exhibition.This means, I can only carry out my project with your help :) Moreover, time is short!!- August is less than 2 months away - and I have to gather sufficient funds beforehand, so let's make this happen!!

<br/>My Story &amp; Motivation :)</h3>
</div><div>
<p>I was born and raised as a child to Vietnamese immigrants who came to this foreign country as contract workers decades ago. Starting a new life with almost nothing, they had to earn a living through heavy manual labor. My parents wanted to make sure we children get to live a better life with less hardship than they had had so they always put our education first and I couldn't be more grateful for that. </p>
<p>Years later, with amazing educational opportunities that were possible thanks to scholarships that I received along the way and great people and mentors that I met, I got to learn about foreign cultures and people, lived in different countries in the world and I now hold university degrees that will ensure me a stable future. </p>
<p>This project is combining my hobby of creating art with my wish to help other children with less opportunities to receive education, so that they can build a future for themselves. While I lived in Japan, through some friends I joined events of Betoaji where we raised funds for children in Vietnam, the home country of my parents. I chose to donate the profit of this project to this particular organization because it targets intercultural exchange on the one side and provides access to education on the other side. I wanted to be sure that even if we only gather a small amount of funds, our contribution could make an impact and reach the children for sure.</p>

<h2>Artastic is an artbook with a cause: it wants to help undiscovered artists shine. </h2>
<p> </p>
<h3><strong>By supporting this project, you'll help more than 90 creators bring their work into the world. </strong></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Hi, my name is Hitomi, or Blizz-Mii, founder and organizer of the Artastic Art Books.</p>
<p>Any artist knows that it's a long ride up the popularity ladder. A lot of artists remain pretty much undiscovered, despite being very talented.</p>
<p>Artastic began with a simple mission: to help undiscovered artists get more exposure. It combines popular and lesser known artists into a single production.</p>
<p>The first book was successfully funded on Kickstarter and released last year, in 2016. (Thanks, everyone!!) Artastic: First Love is the second book in the series, and if all goes well, it will continue Artastic's mission to help undiscovered artists shine!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Do you remember your first love?</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>First love is something that many people hold dear. It evokes a diversity of strong emotions and memories. In this book, you’ll be able to immerse yourself in the many experiences of first love.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Artastic: First Love is an anthology of art, stories, and manga that will tug at your heartstrings. :) </h3>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The biggest challenge will be on the artists and writers completing their works (especially the mangas -- those can take some time). I'm also thinking of using Amazon FBA, which will be a new frontier for me.</p>
<p>I've gone through the actual production of books a couple of times, though, so that should be relatively straightforward. I am working with the same manufacturing company as well.</p>
<p>The previous Artastic book was completed on schedule, so hopefully this book will too!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Disclaimers</strong></p>
<p>* Full disclosure: I am a friend of LGBTQ and encourage the artists in this book to draw/write whatever orientation they wish, as long as it remains PG-13. (There will be no explicit adult content in this book.) If this offends you, please navigate away. I really appreciate you for looking anyway!</p>
<p>* That said, the artists aren’t asked to “represent” any orientation. So please don’t take offense if there isn’t enough representation. I don’t want to impose a quota and limit artists' creativity.</p>

</div></div>","Artastic is an artbook with a cause: it wants to help undiscovered artists shine. 
 
By supporting this project, you'll help more than 90 creators bring their work into the world. 
 
Hi, my name is Hitomi, or Blizz-Mii, founder and organizer of the Artastic Art Books.
Any artist knows that it's a long ride up the popularity ladder. A lot of artists remain pretty much undiscovered, despite being very talented.
Artastic began with a simple mission: to help undiscovered artists get more exposure. It combines popular and lesser known artists into a single production.
The first book was successfully funded on Kickstarter and released last year, in 2016. (Thanks, everyone!!) Artastic: First Love is the second book in the series, and if all goes well, it will continue Artastic's mission to help undiscovered artists shine!
 
Do you remember your first love?
 
First love is something that many people hold dear. It evokes a diversity of strong emotions and memories. In this book, you’ll be able to immerse yourself in the many experiences of first love.
 
Artastic: First Love is an anthology of art, stories, and manga that will tug at your heartstrings. :) 
 



Content

90+ pages
38 full page art pieces
3 short stories (~5 pages each)
3 short manga (~5 to 15 pages each)
4 pages with 4 art pieces
2 pages with 16 art pieces
4 pages of ""My First Love” blurbs by artists
90+ artists (expected)

Specs

A4 size
Softcover, perfect bound
Matte cover

Tentative Release Date: April 2018

 



 

 








 

 
Risks & Challenges
The biggest challenge will be on the artists and writers completing their works (especially the mangas -- those can take some time). I'm also thinking of using Amazon FBA, which will be a new frontier for me.
I've gone through the actual production of books a couple of times, though, so that should be relatively straightforward. I am working with the same manufacturing company as well.
The previous Artastic book was completed on schedule, so hopefully this book will too!
 
Disclaimers
* Full disclosure: I am a friend of LGBTQ and encourage the artists in this book to draw/write whatever orientation they wish, as long as it remains PG-13. (There will be no explicit adult content in this book.) If this offends you, please navigate away. I really appreciate you for looking anyway!
* That said, the artists aren’t asked to “represent” any orientation. So please don’t take offense if there isn’t enough representation. I don’t want to impose a quota and limit artists' creativity.

<p>2nd Floor Rear is an annual multidisciplinary arts festival that celebrates Chicago’s vibrant community of alternative art spaces and DIY creative practices.

</ul></div>","The EU-ONE is an electronic multi-synthesizer musical instrument. The EU-ONE can be played  similarly to how one can play an acoustic instrument. It also allows you to freely change between its sound and play modes. It utilizes Bluetooth so you can change settings easily from your mobile device. Our partners have developed dedicated app so that the instrument can be used to play music and games which makes learning easier and more fun. Additionally, the EU-ONE is foldable so that it increases portability and convenience. Anytime and anywhere, you can enjoy the experience of playing the EU-ONE.We love listening to music and playing musical instruments; therefore our goal is to facilitate enjoyment for our customers through music and instruments. However, there is a steep learning curve and many people give up halfway. In recent years, we have observed the trend of open source and apps becoming very popular. This has led to many innovative products and is the inspiration behind the idea of the EU-ONE.However, the development of the EU-ONE is just the first step. We would like to promote the EU-ONE by opening our design and source codes.   By doing so, everyone can reference, download and modify free of charge. We welcome all music lovers and engineers to assist with designs and create multi-functional musical instruments on this platform together. We hope to attract more app developers to develop a variety of music games and teaching aid apps.

Reseña (Español)
Hola a todos amigos de Indiegogo.
Mi nombre es Manuel López Orozco, tengo 26 Años y vivo en la ciudad de Medellín.


Desde niño comencé mi camino hacia el Arte, siendo la Música la que me ayudó como ruta para formarme primeramente como Persona y segundo poder encontrarme con diferentes escenarios Artísticos y Sociales al rededor de  comunidades cercanas y otras bellas comunidades de Colombia.
Crecí en una comuna fuertemente golpeada por el conflicto armado, la drogadicción y la falta de oportunidades reales para miles de  jóvenes soñadores. 
Fue así como desde temprana edad y con los pocos conocimientos que he ido alcanzando, decidí comenzar mi propio proceso Social Artístico enseñándole a niños, jóvenes y adultos  el cómo soñar haciendo música y Arte,  aportando a su vez la reconstrucción del tejido Social.





Algunos de estos procesos y organizaciones que abalan mi Labor:

Guitarras Andantes  y Percutubos.


Haciendo Tubofonos juntos con Abdulla en Colombia



Corporación casa mia (organización social y cultural)





Colonia de San luis (organización enfocada al trabajo con comunidad desplazada)
legión del Afecto (DPS) Departamento para la prosperidad Social
Mesa de la cultura de la comuna 6 de Medellín


Soy integrante y a la vez vocalista de una propuesta Musical llamada  KoGgi Kroker, en el que interpretamos Música Inédita y con la que hemos podido traspasar y cortar fronteras para unir la gente en pro a la vida y a la esperanza.





Con mi guitarra he podido llegar a territorios de mi ciudad e incluso del departamento y el país, donde por culpa del temor y las secuelas de la guerra ha mucha gente le ha sido casi imposible llegar.



Mi gran amor por las comunidades, sus tradiciones, culturas y pensamientos; han sido el mayor factor motivante  para recorrer y conocer cada día mas cada territorio.

Soy percusionista y toco batería con las manos en una Banda de musica experimental llamada Kerbveros





     ""Bahrein... Un Sueño Posible""
Hace tres años, llegó a mi país y a mi vida un joven viajero llamado Abdulla Faisal,  a quien  hoy por hoy podría decir que es mi hermano, no de sangre pero si de una gran Amistad. 





Al llegar a mi país, pude recorrer con el y enseñarle algunos de nuestros mejores Paisajes Urbanos y Rurales, montañas, fauna y flora y así cumplir poco a poco su gran sueño de conocer Colombia y su verdadera Realidad mas allá de lo que simplemente dicen los medios de comunicación.




Gracias a él, pude saber que existe tambien un País llamado Bahrein, un pequeño País Árabe lleno de cosas hermosas, tradiciones y con una riqueza cultural fenomenal. 





Él también es Músico y posee una Banda llamada Majaz, donde para ambos ha sido un sueño poder tocar juntos allá.
https://www.facebook.com/MajazBH?fref=ts





Desafortunadamente el presupuesto monetario para viajar a un lugar de estos es alto y no he podido reunir suficiente dinero para poder cumplir con este Sueño.

Lo que necesitamos y lo que obtienes
Para este viaje a Bahrein, es necesario recaudar al rededor 3000 Dolares para invertirlos de la siguiente manera:

Tiquetes del avión. ($1900)
La visa ($100)
Las Necesidades básicas ""Comida, Transporte, comprar regalos"" ($1000)
Y el resto, mi amigo Abdulla faisal se hará cargo en su país.

El impacto
Mi viaje a Bahrein, será componiendo una canción de este bello país y poderlo cantar KoGgi Kroker y Majaz juntos, ya sea por video o concierto.
Realizar registros fotográficos y videos de la visita por Bahrein y exponerlo luego en diferentes organizaciones sociales para que el mundo conozca un poco de aquellas riquezas culturales del medio Oriente.
Deseo aprender demasiado de las culturas y tradiciones y mirar la forma de realizar algunas labores sociales con los niños, jóvenes y adultos.
Mejorar mi nivel en el idioma Ingles.
Y no olvidarmos, que será mi primera vez en salir y viajar en toda mi vida.

Riesgos y desafíos
Pienso que el mayor riesgo sería Enamorarme de este país y su cultura, pero vale la pena soñarlo.

Review (English)
Hello to all my friends at Indiegogo,
I’m Manuel Lopez, 26 years old, living in Medellin, Colombia. 

My story begins with my relationship with art, it started when I was a young kid. 
Making music has always been my passion, and it had helped me to become the person I am today. 
Music has not only developed me personally, but also opened a door for me to many art communities and social projects in the beautiful neighborhoods of Medellin and Colombia in general
I decided to dedicate myself at a young age to teach children, youngsters and adults to dream by making music and art, so they themselves can heal the scars of some communities in Colombia.




My history and the Organizations I work with:

Corporation ‘Casa Mia’ (a social and cultural organization) 



Guitarras Andantes  y Percutubos

Making Tubephones with Abdulla in Colombia


Colony of San Luis (focused on working with displaced communities)  
Legion of Affection (DPS) Department for Social Prosperity
Member of the Cultural Office of ‘Comuna 6’ (a neighborhood in Medellin) 


Alongside this I am a vocalist with the artist name KoGgi Kroker, and I play unpublished music through which we have been able to pass and cut borders, and to unite people in favor of life and hope.





With my guitar I have been able to access places in my city, my state, my country,

 
The great love I carry for my communities, its traditions, cultures, and thoughts, have been the main motivation to travel and discover more places every day.
I'm also a drummer and I play drums with my hands in an experimental music band called Kerbveros





‘Bahrein… A Possible Dream’
Three years ago, a young traveler named Abdulla Faisal entered into my country and stepped into my life. Today, I can call him my brother, perhaps not by blood but certainly by the strong friendship we share.





At his arrival in Colombia, I was able to travel with him and show him some of our beautiful urban and natural views: mountains, fauna and flora, neighborhoods in Medellin. This way, little by little, he fulfilled his great dream to get to know Colombia and its true reality. A more profound reality of what Colombia is, beyond that what the media reports about it.




Thanks to him, I learned more about Bahrein as well. A small Arab country that not many people heard of it, yet it's filled with beautiful traditions and a phenomenal culture.




Abdulla is also a musician, and part of a band called Majaz. We share the dream to one day play together in Bahrein.
https://www.facebook.com/MajazBH?fref=ts




Unfortunately the monetary budget for such travels is very high but it's what makes me insist on doing it and fulfil my big dream which is traveling outside Colombia for the first time!


What We Need
I'll need around $3000 for the needs below :
- Flight Ticket ($1900)
- Visa ($100)
- Basic Needs ""Food, Transportation, Souvenirs"" ($1000)
- And the rest will be provided by my friend Abdulla 


The impact
This trip will help me compose a song about this beautiful and infamous country and it will be written by me Koggi Kroker and Majaz together, with a video clip and a concert to perform it.
Make an art gallery and short videos about Bahrain, the arab world, and my visit there, and showcase it in Colombia and introduce them to things they find interesting in the middle east 
I wish to learn a lot from such a distinct culture and traditions, and find my way to introduce something unique and completely new to the arab kids.
Improve my level in English 
And of course, that this will be the very first time for me to travel outside my country in my whole life!
Risks & Challenges

<p>Soline
Scutella was born in Montpellier and has Italian roots. From a very young age,
she has been devouring the books of the family library and she has been
thinking, among other things, of becoming a librarian. Maybe someday, she
thought to herself…</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448213448/esk5svalq5ygx1vmpswm.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p><span>  However, being a traveler at heart,
she preferred to discover the world and its various cultures : as soon as she
turned fifteen years old, she boarded planes and trains as easily as others
would get into their cars.</span></p>
<p><span>  After backpacking around the world
for about twenty years and working for the TV and cartoon industries from 1996 to 2006, Soline
Scutella immersed herself into the world of comic strips and illustration in
2009, from her office located in Angoulême, a south-western town in France. She
hardly leaves her “headquarters”, except in order to join festivals and meet crowds
of curious and enthusiastic readers. </span></p>
<p><span>  On her publishing journeys, she
often comes across talented writers who are sometimes willing to work some time
with her within her own structure she named “Scutella Éditions”.</span></p>
<p><span>  Thus, in 2014, she discovered the
amazing works by Ciou, a painter dedicated to the lobrow movement. Soline and
Ciou met through Arts BD (</span><a href=""http://www.artsbd.fr"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">www.artsbd.fr</a>),
an editorial structure specialized in illustration and graphic arts, which has
enabled the artist to publish silkscreens and posters since 2012. Both women
took up the crazy challenge of revisiting <i>Poucette</i>,
also called <i>Thumbelina</i>, <br/></p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1449166939/owwnrfsmlwubase9rkcn.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

<p>a famous
nineteenth-century tale by Hans Christian Andersen, by means of an
English-French translation with about thirty illustrations in keeping with the
culture of the trash-punk-kawaï movements. Poucette is a little girl born of a
seed. After experiencing many adventures, she turns into the Queen of Flowers.</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448213504/ffinpea3kxrfjhac0hfi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The immersion into the world of this
nineteenth-century fairy tale and Ciou’s interpretation of it lead the reader to
discover a contemporary acrylic and ink painting reviving the wonder and
cruelty of Andersen’s world in a magnificent display of colors, lights and
shadows, not to forget unexpected details which are absolutely mesmerizing. </p>
<p>Entering Ciou’s world implies agreeing to be
emotionally overwhelmed, accepting disturbing unspoken truths, an order
emerging from chaos and an outstanding aestheticism.</p>
<p>This version of <i>Thumbelina</i>
turns out to be completely new and original, complex and thrilling : it
combines contemporary art with nineteenth-century magical extravaganza in an
illustrated, bilingual edition of Andersen’s text, bringing two authors, two
worlds and two periods together, although they are separated by almost two centuries. </p>
<p>A daring wager resulting from a fully conscious choice!
Will you be part of the adventure?</p>

<p><b>Ciou Biography  <br/></b></p>
<p><b><a href=""http://ciou.eu/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">http://ciou.eu/</a></b></p>
<p>Ciou, was  born in Toulouse in 1981, she  actually works and lives in her home town , after living in Bruxelles and Paris.</p>
<p>She succeeded to gain a relevant place in the world of contemporary 
pop art and lowbrow, at a very young age . The exhibit that gave her 
international visibility was in 2004 at the Flux Factory gallery  in New
 York City  with the group show  » Cute and Scary » with confirmed 
lowbrow artists. From there she went on to show in Amsterdam  at the 
Kochxbos gallery, Paris, Barcelona, Brussels, California, Portland, Roma
  , Tokyo, Berlin,  NYC at the Cotton Candy Machine gallery , also 
Seattle with her fist solo show  » Mysterious flowers »  in usa at the 
gallery Roq La Rue in late 2010. She did her fourth solo show at the 
Kochxbos gallery in January 2015 and  always working in several group 
show in USA and Europe.</p>
<p>In the media, the art and life of  ciou was on  Dutch national Tv, 
VPRO  for the international Sarah’s Barbaren documentary. Also she made 
her first book in 2009  » Chat siamois » with the french editor 
Venusdea. « Ciou collected art  » is out now, 144 pages, first art book ,
 edited by Kochxbos Publishers 2014. She is actually working on a new 
 illustrated book,  a new version of Thumbelina by Christian Hans 
Andersen, edited by Scutella in January 2016</p>
<p></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1448213684/ws74pjppwkcv95gaaf1i.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
<p>Suspended between dream and nightmare, her paintings consist of a 
base made of a collage of old papers, taken from old medical books, 
dictionaries, and nature manuals, where she uses acrylic and ink; 
creating her own personal mixed media  . Her Influences are diverses :  
the american vintage culture from the 30′ to the 70′ , the victorian 
style and the european barocco   too  , however she is focused on the 
japanese culture and  japanese traditional  and contemporary art .  Her 
style is  characterized by a line of great expressive force and a 
language where the power of color and deformation of shapes combine to 
make her stroke unmistakable . Ciou creates her  own « necro-kawai » 
cosmology of characters mainly centered around witch-y nature burlesque 
girls and their  strange animal companions.  Her new works feature 
florescent psychedelic colors as a foil for her obsessive black line 
work. Her darkly charming works are creepy in a very playful way, a 
little bit of sweet and a little bit of sour in a friendly and dangerous
 world .</p>

trash-punk-kawaï, en une trentaine d’illustrations inédites et décalées, et en
2 langues (Français et Anglais), le conte du XIXème siècle de Hans Christian
Andersen : <i>Poucette</i> ou <i>Thumbelina</i>, cette petite fille née d’une graine et qui, après moult aventures, se

d’artifice de couleurs, de lumières et d’ombres, de détails inattendus qui vous
hypnotisent littéralement : entrer dans l’univers de Ciou, c’est accepter le

Son premier livre illustré est édité en 2009 sous le titre « Chat

créer un carnet de 12 timbres «  Féérie astrologique » par La Poste.

Ciou popose une adaptation de Poucette de Christian Hans Andersen, édité par
Scutella en 2016.<br/>
Ces influences sont nombreuses, on y trouve aussi bien le vintage américain des
années 30 aux années 70 que le baroque européen et le style victorien du 19ème.
Ciou est avant tout passionnée par l’art contemporain et traditionnel japonais.<br/>
Ciou crée sa propre cosmologie «  nécro kawaï » autour
d’ensorcelantes danseuses burlesques et de leurs étranges compagnons. Ces
travaux récents sont remplis d’arborescences aux couleurs psychédéliques. <br/>

Even though she is French, Ciou is little known to the
French public and the aim of her book <i>Thumbelina</i> is to introduce her wonderful
re-interpretation of this classic childhood tale, <i>Poucette</i> or <i>Thumbelina </i>(or
<i>Tomelise</i> in the first translations)
to the French and wider international public. 

<p>Furthermore, <a rel=""noopener nofollow""><span>the presentation of her storyboard display</span></a><span></span> during the 2016
FIBD will enable children to become familiar on the one hand with Andersen, and

Ciou’s version of Thumbelina dares to combine a
nineteenth century fairytale with the trash-punk-kawaii vision of a
contemporary artist. Thus from an artistic perspective it represents a very
real challenge for both the editor and the author to share with as many people
as possible this very unconventional aestheticism and graphic technique.

<p>Our role is also to raise public awareness of
different forms of art…</p>
<p>… and Scutella Editions is gradually becoming
recognised for its catalogue of amazing books, graphically surprising and
always beautifully produced. The books are invariably hardbacked, bound with

Soline
Scutella was born in Montpellier and has Italian roots. From a very young age,
she has been devouring the books of the family library and she has been
thinking, among other things, of becoming a librarian. Maybe someday, she
thought to herself…



  However, being a traveler at heart,
she preferred to discover the world and its various cultures : as soon as she
turned fifteen years old, she boarded planes and trains as easily as others
would get into their cars.
  After backpacking around the world
for about twenty years and working for the TV and cartoon industries from 1996 to 2006, Soline
Scutella immersed herself into the world of comic strips and illustration in
2009, from her office located in Angoulême, a south-western town in France. She
hardly leaves her “headquarters”, except in order to join festivals and meet crowds
of curious and enthusiastic readers. 
  On her publishing journeys, she
often comes across talented writers who are sometimes willing to work some time
with her within her own structure she named “Scutella Éditions”.
  Thus, in 2014, she discovered the
amazing works by Ciou, a painter dedicated to the lobrow movement. Soline and
Ciou met through Arts BD (www.artsbd.fr),
an editorial structure specialized in illustration and graphic arts, which has
enabled the artist to publish silkscreens and posters since 2012. Both women
took up the crazy challenge of revisiting Poucette,
also called Thumbelina, 





a famous
nineteenth-century tale by Hans Christian Andersen, by means of an
English-French translation with about thirty illustrations in keeping with the
culture of the trash-punk-kawaï movements. Poucette is a little girl born of a
seed. After experiencing many adventures, she turns into the Queen of Flowers.


The immersion into the world of this
nineteenth-century fairy tale and Ciou’s interpretation of it lead the reader to
discover a contemporary acrylic and ink painting reviving the wonder and
cruelty of Andersen’s world in a magnificent display of colors, lights and
shadows, not to forget unexpected details which are absolutely mesmerizing. 
Entering Ciou’s world implies agreeing to be
emotionally overwhelmed, accepting disturbing unspoken truths, an order
emerging from chaos and an outstanding aestheticism.
This version of Thumbelina
turns out to be completely new and original, complex and thrilling : it
combines contemporary art with nineteenth-century magical extravaganza in an
illustrated, bilingual edition of Andersen’s text, bringing two authors, two
worlds and two periods together, although they are separated by almost two centuries. 
A daring wager resulting from a fully conscious choice!
Will you be part of the adventure?



Ciou Biography  
http://ciou.eu/
Ciou, was  born in Toulouse in 1981, she  actually works and lives in her home town , after living in Bruxelles and Paris.
She succeeded to gain a relevant place in the world of contemporary 
pop art and lowbrow, at a very young age . The exhibit that gave her 
international visibility was in 2004 at the Flux Factory gallery  in New
 York City  with the group show  » Cute and Scary » with confirmed 
lowbrow artists. From there she went on to show in Amsterdam  at the 
Kochxbos gallery, Paris, Barcelona, Brussels, California, Portland, Roma
  , Tokyo, Berlin,  NYC at the Cotton Candy Machine gallery , also 
Seattle with her fist solo show  » Mysterious flowers »  in usa at the 
gallery Roq La Rue in late 2010. She did her fourth solo show at the 
Kochxbos gallery in January 2015 and  always working in several group 
show in USA and Europe.
In the media, the art and life of  ciou was on  Dutch national Tv, 
VPRO  for the international Sarah’s Barbaren documentary. Also she made 
her first book in 2009  » Chat siamois » with the french editor 
Venusdea. « Ciou collected art  » is out now, 144 pages, first art book ,
 edited by Kochxbos Publishers 2014. She is actually working on a new 
 illustrated book,  a new version of Thumbelina by Christian Hans 
Andersen, edited by Scutella in January 2016



Suspended between dream and nightmare, her paintings consist of a 
base made of a collage of old papers, taken from old medical books, 
dictionaries, and nature manuals, where she uses acrylic and ink; 
creating her own personal mixed media  . Her Influences are diverses :  
the american vintage culture from the 30′ to the 70′ , the victorian 
style and the european barocco   too  , however she is focused on the 
japanese culture and  japanese traditional  and contemporary art .  Her 
style is  characterized by a line of great expressive force and a 
language where the power of color and deformation of shapes combine to 
make her stroke unmistakable . Ciou creates her  own « necro-kawai » 
cosmology of characters mainly centered around witch-y nature burlesque 
girls and their  strange animal companions.  Her new works feature 
florescent psychedelic colors as a foil for her obsessive black line 
work. Her darkly charming works are creepy in a very playful way, a 
little bit of sweet and a little bit of sour in a friendly and dangerous
 world .

French
Native de
Montpellier, et d’origine italienne, Soline Scutella dévore les livres de la bibliothèque
familiale très jeune et pense, entre autres, à devenir libraire, un jour
peut-être... .

Mais, nomade
dans l’âme, elle préfère découvrir le monde et ses cultures dès l’âge de 15 ans
et saute dans un avion ou un train comme d’autres prennent leur voiture. 

Après avoir
promené son sac à dos dans le monde entier pendant une vingtaine d’années et travaillé
pour la télévision et le dessin animé entre 1996 et 2006, Soline Scutella
plonge dans la bande dessinée et l’illustration en 2009 depuis son QG
d’Angoulême, dans le Sud-Ouest de la France dont elle ne sort que très peu,
sinon pour courir les festivals et rencontrer un public curieux et passionné ! 

Dans ses
pérégrinations d’éditrice, Soline croise souvent la route d’auteurs talentueux
qui, parfois, veulent bien faire un bout de chemin au sein de sa structure
éditoriale indépendante, Scutella Editions.

C’est ainsi qu’elle découvre, en 2014, le travail
étonnant de l’artiste Ciou, peintre affiliée au mouvement nécro-kawaï. 

Par l’intermédiare d’Arts BD (www.artsbd.fr), chez qui
Ciou publie des sérigraphies et affiches depuis 2012, l’éditrice et l’artiste
se rencontrent et prennent le pari un peu fou de revisiter sur le mode
trash-punk-kawaï, en une trentaine d’illustrations inédites et décalées, et en
2 langues (Français et Anglais), le conte du XIXème siècle de Hans Christian
Andersen : Poucette ou Thumbelina, cette petite fille née d’une graine et qui, après moult aventures, se
transforme en Reine des Fleurs.

La plongée dans l’univers de ce conte féérique du
XIXème et l’interprétation qu’en donne Ciou à travers Thumbelina, emmènent le
lecteur à la découverte d’une peinture contemporaine, à l’acrylique et l’encre,
qui ressuscite l’onirisme et la cruauté du monde d’Andersen dans un feu
d’artifice de couleurs, de lumières et d’ombres, de détails inattendus qui vous
hypnotisent littéralement : entrer dans l’univers de Ciou, c’est accepter le
bouleversement émotionnel, les non-dits qui dérangent, l’ordre qui émerge du
chaos, et un esthétisme hors normes.



Notre proposition sur le conte Thumbelina
s’avère inédite et originale, complexe et haletante parce qu’elle allie art
contemporain et féérie du XIXème, dans une vision illustrée du texte d’Andersen,
en 2 langues, le Français et l’Anglais, dans des traductions contemporaines de
l’écrivain : ici se rencontrent, échangent et construisent ensemble deux
auteurs, deux mondes, deux époques, à plusieurs siècles d’intervalle.

En somme, la réinterprétation aux couleurs du
XXIème siècle de l’imaginaire né avant 1900.

Pari audacieux, pari assumé ! En
serez-vous ?

Biographie de Ciou
http://ciou.eu/




Ciou a su se faire une place dans le milieu international du
Pop art contemporain et du Lowbrow.
Sa première grande exposition collective «  Cute and scary » a eu
lieu en 2004, à New york à la galerie Flux Factory. L’international lui ouvre
rapidement ses frontières. 
Elle expose à Amsterdam à la galerie Kochxbos, puis à Paris, Barcelone,
Bruxelles, Californie, Portland, Rome, Melbourne,Tokyo, Berlin, Dublin, Suisse,
ainsi qu’à Seattle pour sa première exposition personnelle américaine « 
Mysterious Flowers » à la galerie Roque La Rue. Elle est représentée par
la galerie Kochxbos à Amsterdam et ses oeuvres sont exposées à la galerie
Cotton Candy Machine à New york. 



Son premier livre illustré est édité en 2009 sous le titre « Chat
Siamois », écrit par Guillaume Bianco. En 2014 elle est sélectionnée pour
créer un carnet de 12 timbres «  Féérie astrologique » par La Poste.
Les originaux du carnet font partie de la collection permanente du musées de la
Poste de Paris. Le Premier Artbook est édité en 2014 par la galerie
néerlandaise Kochxbos. Il retrace dix ans d’expositions et de création. 
Ciou popose une adaptation de Poucette de Christian Hans Andersen, édité par
Scutella en 2016.
Ces influences sont nombreuses, on y trouve aussi bien le vintage américain des
années 30 aux années 70 que le baroque européen et le style victorien du 19ème.
Ciou est avant tout passionnée par l’art contemporain et traditionnel japonais.
Ciou crée sa propre cosmologie «  nécro kawaï » autour
d’ensorcelantes danseuses burlesques et de leurs étranges compagnons. Ces
travaux récents sont remplis d’arborescences aux couleurs psychédéliques. 
Les oeuvres de Ciou mêlent subtilement onirisme et cauchemar, un univers
merveilleusement acide.

L'impact


Ciou, bien que française, est peu connue du public en
France, et le livre Thumbelina a pour objectif de faire découvrir aux lecteurs
français mais aussi internationaux, sa magnifique réinterprétation d’un conte
de notre enfance, Poucette ou Thumbelina (ou Tomelise pour les premières
traductions).
De plus, la présentation de son exposition contée lors
du FIBD 2016 permettra aux enfants de se familiariser avec Andersen d’une part,
et le monde de Ciou, très étonnant, d’autre part. Le rôle d’un éditeur consiste
aussi à faire partager et à donner accès à la culture à tous, petits et grands.


Even though she is French, Ciou is little known to the
French public and the aim of her book Thumbelina is to introduce her wonderful
re-interpretation of this classic childhood tale, Poucette or Thumbelina (or
Tomelise in the first translations)
to the French and wider international public. 

Furthermore, the presentation of her storyboard display during the 2016
FIBD will enable children to become familiar on the one hand with Andersen, and
on the other with the surprising world of Ciou. Sharing and allowing everyone, both young and
old, to have access to culture is also the rôle of the editor.









C’est la première fois que Scutella
lance un tel projet, et en plus sur une plate-forme internationale, c’est donc
une toute nouvelle expérience, surtout pour une petite maison d’édition et son
artiste, toutes deux françaises ! Donc, pardon pour mon anglais probablement
un peu scolaire, et merci de nous soutenir dans cette aventure un peu
folle !


This is the first time that Scutella has launched such
a project, particularly on an international site. So, it is a whole new
experience, especially for a small publishing house and its author, who are both

et les chanceux du côté de Los Angeles peuvent trouver certains des titres du

Risques et défis


Proposer Thumbelina par Ciou, c’est
oser l’alliance du conte féérique du XIXème siècle et la vision
trash-punk-kawaï d’une artiste contemporaine : c’est donc un vrai défi artistique
à relever pour l’éditrice et l’auteure afin de faire partager au plus grand
nombre un esthétisme et une technique graphique hors normes.
C’est aussi notre rôle que de
sensibiliser le public aux différentes formes d’art.

Ciou’s version of Thumbelina dares to combine a
nineteenth century fairytale with the trash-punk-kawaii vision of a
contemporary artist. Thus from an artistic perspective it represents a very
real challenge for both the editor and the author to share with as many people
as possible this very unconventional aestheticism and graphic technique.

Our role is also to raise public awareness of
different forms of art…
… and Scutella Editions is gradually becoming

always beautifully produced. The books are invariably hardbacked, bound with
canvas finish and printed on high-quality paper, in compliance with
environmental protection standards, All of which gives the books a beautiful,
long-lasting finish, and guarantees lifelong pleasure on your library bookshelves!


Le plus gros problème à l’heure
actuelle pour publier de beaux livres, c’est le mode de financement : le
système bancaire classique ne répond pas à la demande de financement de
fabrication du stock, et c’est notamment la raison pour laquelle ma structure
modeste se tourne vers les internautes : vous êtes les meilleurs juges sur
un tel projet, et votre degré d’implication permet de mesurer la cohérence dudit
projet immédiatement.
De plus, pour un artiste, voir les
gens se mobiliser autour de la création de son œuvre, constitue une véritable
reconnaissance de son travail et je suis toujours étonnée de voir à quel point
les auteurs sont sensibles au retour des internautes et plus qu’émus du soutien
généré par le financement participatif.
Les contributeurs sont tout
simplement de formidables mécènes, et vont aider à la naissance et la vie de
l’œuvre.


Today the biggest constraint in publishing beautiful
books is the method of funding. The traditional banking system does not support
the need for funding to produce stock, and that is why my modest structure is
looking to the Internet for support.  You
are the best judges of such a project, and your level of involvement will
enable us to assess immediately the conherence of the project.
Furthermore, when an artist sees people rallying
around and taking an interest in the creation of his work, it is a true recognition
of that work. I am always surprised to
see how sensitive authors are to the participation of Internet contributors,
and how emotional they become when receiving support generated by crowdfunding.
Contributors are quite simply incredible patrons, and they
contribute to the birth and life of an artist’s work.

</ul><p>Thank you<b>!</b></p></div>","The idea of the international street art project Urban Myths is to create a new vision of modern cities through the eyes of their citizens. In summer 2016, prominent street artists from different counties will gather in the heart of Eastern Europe, in Belarus, to create a series of murals based on the dialogue with locals.Who we areWe are a group of activists who seek to bring the street-art to a new level. We see the street-art as not only a change of urban image, but also as a way to create new meaning. That is why we promote ambigous art that evokes spectator’s emotions and makes him/her see numerous phenomenon and problems in a different way.Urban Myths is not a boring municipal project for decorating dull buildings, but a good provoking with elements of slight and positive hooliganism. For the real street-art is a game and claiming for discussion!We would love to see our artworks not just decorating a city, but inspiring its citizens!BackgroundIn autumn 2015, we organized the first international project Urban Myths. During three months  street artists from different countries painted Minsk buildings based on their talks with local activists and modern history. Two of the Minsk murals –Man without Identity and Girl in Embroidered Shirt – for the first time in Belarus history were rated within the top 10 best graffiti of the month in the world.You can watch this TV-report to see the result:
Photo gallery here->

Urban Myths-2016  is a chance to rise and shine in a different way, it’s a chance for collaboration between artists and it’s a chance to improve ourselves and our environment.
The unique part of the festival is in the idea of exploration of local modern history and urban legends by street artists. We hope this is the way to make artworks be contextual and assist locals to develop their own urban identity.

Dates of the festival Urban Myths 2016: May 2016 - June 2016

The money raised will be expensed for 5 huge murals by world-renowed street artists! Calculation is the simplest ever: 5 murals = 5 artists = 5 countries = $12 500 
The budget considers only the most essential points:

artrists’ travel and visa costs
artists’ accomodation
paint and painting tools
lifting equipment rent costs

The more money we raise - the more amazing street-art will be performed!

We already have:

a group of inspired volunteers experienced in organizing similar projects;  
a support from local municipalities;  
an interest in participation of well-known street artists (here are some examples of their works):


 (Deih, Spain)
 (QBic, Russia)



(T-Radya, Russia)

 (Predok, Belarus)

(Hyuro, Spain)

(Mutus, Belarus)

<p>DAYTRIP is a Toronto-based collective comprised of Erich DeLeeuw, Matthew Volpe and Andrew Savery-Whiteway. Their latest endeavour <i>After Frank</i> is a documentation of their pilgrimage from Toronto to Mabou, Nova Scotia to New York City, in search of the iconic photographer Robert Frank. Adopting the canon of the great American road trip, with a specific focus on Canadian ephemera, this project is in part an homage to Robert Frank’s seminal series <i>The Americans</i>, a road map for DAYTRIP’s exploration of Canada. The DAYTRIP collective observes and documents subtle elements of discarded Canadiana, while defining a new precedent for the social landscape of a changing country. Returning to fundamental camera systems, small format Black and White 35mm film, the images are especially immersive and draw the viewer into the captured scenarios as a close voyeur. The exhibition of photographs will feature the launch of Issue No.2 of DAYTRIP’s book series, alongside a short documentary film shot on the journey.</p>

I have been an artist since I could hold a pencil and it has always been my passion. My wife, Monique and I work together at Derek Alvarez Art. We have two little boys, Sam and Grant (Irish Twins) and I wanted to be able to spend as much time with them as possible while still working to provide all they need. Painting on the iPad allows me to continue making art with my boys around me in a non-toxic environment. <br/></p>
<p>We adopted our dog, Charlie Parker, from a shelter in Colorado almost seven years ago and he's like a child to us. My older son Sam adores dogs, ours included, and I thought painting a series of dogs would be fun. Monique had the idea to turn it into a contest where proud pet lovers could submit their dog and story. We received over 50 submissions at last count through our Facebook event.</p>
<p>Congratulations to:</p>Susan Tiss and Ruairi<br/>Leah Cox and Pony Boy<br/>Colette Nicole and Thor &amp; Happy<br/>Cher Heath and Miracle<br/>Nicole Gregory and Roxy<br/>Kelly Laurich and Oliver &amp; Oscar<br/>Lily Carrizosa and Adonis<br/>Frederick Calabrese and Chipper<br/>Jo Martinez and Louie and Alfie<br/>Brock Cruzan and Boo<br/>Kara McMillian and Mr. Gatsby<br/>Adrennia Gates and Brody &amp; Red<br/>Pauline Haas-Vaughn and Pixel<br/>Karyn Garvin and Luke<br/><br/><p>We will donate 10% of the proceeds to Pima Animal Care Center located in Tucson, Arizona, where we call home.<br/></p>
<p>Having a successful campaign will allow us to print the calendars (locally through AlphaGraphics), ship them and get them in at least 1,000 homes by the new year. <br/></p>
<h4>What We Need &amp; What's In It For You...</h4>
<p>We have set our goal to raise $5,000 because this will ensure that we can pay to have 1,000 Pop Dogs 2016 Calendars printed and ready to ship. If we don't reach our goal we'll use the funds to order as many calendars as the funds allow. We will also use a portion of funds for marketing and advertising costs.<br/></p>
<p>As small business owners we are really excited about getting the entire community involved in this project. We have some pretty special perks for businesses and individuals who love and support us here. For example, businesses can sponsor the calendar and have their logo on each one or even retail them during calendar season. Individual supporters can get signed calendars, prints and even the chance to have a custom portrait of their pet painted.<br/></p>
<h4>Making A Difference...</h4>
<p>Our project is important to us because we believe the world needs more art and that it's important to give back. Art provides us with a way to connect to our true selves, beauty and the divine. Art helps us gain a greater understanding of our emotions. Art is a reason to slow down in a fast-paced world, time greatly needed to heal, grow and improve ourselves. We want our sons to be exposed to art and to know there is a way to express themselves -- be it painting, music, dance, gardening, or cooking. Creating is key to living and loving. We want to be examples of thriving artists. <br/></p>
<p>We also always want to remember the importance of sharing and giving back. Pima Animal Care 
Center is committed to providing timely service to residents and 
compassionate care to animals, while working to support public safety, 
find homes for homeless animals and educate the community about 
responsible pet ownership. We know firsthand how much joy a dog can bring to a family and we want to help make this happen for families and pets in our community.</p>

creative element of the things I plan to do while traveling with my
mobile art show. 
</p>
<p>In February of 2015, I was gifted with the greatest inspiration of
my life. The PRmia Trance Art inspiration came, as an answer to a
prayer. I asked for an inspiration that could provide an early
retirement, and the opportunity to travel. 
</p>
<p>It has long been my dream to travel, in a motor home, and make my
living off my creative talents. So, I requested that this new
inspiration be something that I could do anywhere, anytime and with
minimal supplies. The PRmia art, requires only a Sharpie, a piece of
paper, and a laptop!!! How perfect! The idea came instantly and has
turned my whole world around! I have already risked a lot to bring it
to where it is now and am willing to risk even more because I don't
think it wise, to waste an answered prayer. I am stepping out in
faith, risking everything, and going for it! I pray you see the value
in assisting me and thank you, in advance, for whatever way you feel
led to do so.</p>
<p>This fund-raising campaign is important to me because I am wanting
an opportunity to live authentically, and purely, as the artist, and
healer that I am, and to share the healing tools,
talents and visions I've been given.</p>
<p>Although my jewelry, and orgonite creations, are wonderful and
fulfilling to create, the PRmia  trance art drawings are beyond
amazing, in their ability to heal and create peace. The PRmia project
is worthy of my best efforts, my commitment, and my dedication. I
have seen the calming and clarifying effect it has on people. I have
seen its healing and stress-relieving qualities at work. I have
watched the way it delivers messages from Spirit, to those open and
wanting to receive. I want to put the PRmia, as well as my other
healing arts, in front of as many people as possible. I am intent on
sharing it, far and wide, as a way to bless many and provide for my
personal needs at the same time.</p>
<p>That would be one dream come true, and I am certain that from that
dream, I will be led into the fulfillment of another. 
</p>
<p>I am in search of an eventual place to settle where I can
contribute my talents and abilities to a self-sustainable
eco-community that runs on a gifting economy, such as or similar to,
my Recipro City vision. Being out on the road, meeting many different
people, will increase my chances of finding such a place.</p>

<p><strong>""Angie is always creating new art, and these are not
only interesting to look at, but even more fun to color, bringing out
the things that you see in the image. I see something different each
time I look at them, and can choose colors based on how I feel to
best express what I'm seeing. It's very helpful if you have a
creative block, to inspire movement in creativity. I can testify to
it. I will be talking more about this later, because it works in many
ways. This art is special, and so is the artist. I know, Angie is my
wife, and this is just the latest of her mind's creativity. Enjoy!

<p><strong>*REVIEW* by Coloring Isn't Just for Kids</strong></p>
<p><strong>PRmia ART FOR COLORING By-Angie Schuyler. PRmia Art is a
22 page coloring book. Pages are all one sided. The paper is normal
thickness so you may need to add a piece of paper between the pages
for bleed through. The pictures in this coloring book are very
different and unique. I have never seen another coloring book like
this one. I cant wait to be able to sit down and color one of these
pages. A lot of coloring books look alike and or have a lot of the
same designs. If you want something different to color than this
coloring book is for you. Angie started drawing the art for these
coloring books on Feb 12th,2015. She has already created 2 coloring
books, PRmia Art for Coloring and PRmia Art for Coloring Book #2. She
is starting on book 3 and 4 but isn't going to bring those out until
the first 2 coloring books get up and going well but she says she is
prepared for that. Angie has been married to her husband Kevin for 5
years. Between the two of them they have 6 grown children and
(almost) 7 grand kids(one on the way). Angie has 2 pets, One is a
Chinchilla named Ziggy and the other is a male Beta Fish named
Rainbow. Angie is a Holistic Healer and she says she has people who
buy her coloring books just to contemplate the art and seek out
different shapes within it. Some simply like to trace the lines with
their fingers and they say it has a peaceful effect on them. The
healing aspect of the art is very important to Angie.</strong></p>

<p>Should this project be over-funded, I will immediately hire a
financial professional, to handle bookkeeping and taxes. Then I'll
put the extra funds in a trust and start a not-for-profit for the
Recipro City project, which supports organic gardens and sustainable
living projects, as well as the creation of an economy that runs on
the law of reciprocity. Should it be over funded, by a million
dollars or more, I just might buy a particular property I am aware of
that would be the perfect location for my Recipro City style
eco-village / healing center / hermitage.</p><p></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1444139115/dpfyb9gjqpxkqkevztn6.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p><strong><u>What You Get for Offering Your

this page, near the top.</p>
<p><strong><u>The Impact my Vision Can Make</u></strong></p>
<p>I am only one person, yet I have much, in the way of healing
tools, inspiration, advice and vision, to offer the people, who's
paths I'll cross, along my ensuing journey.</p>
<p>I want to teach people, about energy work and the power of Love
and reciprocity, to heal and bring positive change. I want to share
about my experiences with Recipro City, so far. I also want to share
my ideas, for changing our economy into a kinder and gentler system
that cares for the needs of all, and does so in ways that help our
natural environment to heal and flourish.</p>
<p>I want to work, with the people I meet along my way, to continue
my <a href=""http://www.reciproeconomy.org/"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>Recipro City</u></a>
experiment, by encouraging them to start <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/reciproeconomy"" rel=""noopener nofollow""><u>Recipro

<p>I don't have any fancy education credentials to share with you.
Everything I have learned, and have to offer has been gifts of Spirit
or gained from personal experience and expressed through natural
talents. I have spent the past 15 years developing my intuition and
my various artistic expressions. Now, I am embarking on a journey
that will allow me to test my faith, in the way I was inspired by my
hero, Peace Pilgrim.</p>
<p>Peace Pilgrim was a woman who walked all over the US, for 28
years, going only on faith to provide for her, while she traveled
around talking to people about peace. My mission is different but I
know I have the faith to take me down the road!</p>

<p><strong><u><b>TESTIMONIALS</b></u></strong></p>
<p><strong>""That art is transformative is certainly not new.
Religious artifacts and architecture in every culture are a testament
to this. But these are brand new times!........This strikes me as art
that’s meant to be used. Each image should be grasped and
manipulated with dexterity and vigor; they should be wrung out to see
what more might be squeezed from pulp and pits, even as our eternal
thirst seems momentarily quenched. It is the consumer of this art who
paradoxically comes to it as the unmolded clay… "" ~ Author ~
Niels Kunze from his article about the Prmia art ""Where Art
Thou""</strong></p>
<p><strong>~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have found that coloring these awesome trance art pieces
has the ability to help me calm myself. I was feeling anxious, my
mind jumping from one ""must do"" thought to another. I
looked through the pages, searching for the image that appealed to me
most. I turned them this way and that. Suddenly, there it was! Once I
started to color the image, I found myself relaxing, my breathing
slowed and became deep and regular. My mind focused on choosing the
colors and finding the patterns, hidden within the picture, that
spoke to my subconscious mind. This is a wonderful tool to use to
help you wake up your imagination and journey deep into your inner
self.~ Tish Sanders</strong></p>
<p><strong>~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</strong></p>
<p><strong>""I took some of Angie's wonderful drawings and I
colored them in with marker. I cannot tell you how relaxing and
connected they help me feel .. they relieve stress and they allowed
my imagination to soar . I love them....try it .. it is wonderful ..
coloring releases any stress I may be having .. I cannot say enough
about them !! "" ~ Carolyn L'Hommedieu</strong></p>
<p><strong>~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</strong></p>
<p><strong>""Meditate… breathe… and then go grab your
crayons! This is artwork that begs to be defaced. Coloring is the
consummation of this marriage. The doodle-art progeny created are
novelty expressions, akin to your own DNA in their uniqueness. And
when you’re finished, it’s not so much that you’ve really
altered the original– it’s still there, underneath– but it’s
more that you put something of yourself into it, a giving of
self-expression… for the opportunity of claiming that expression AS
Self, tangibly… demonstrably."" ~ Author ~ Niels Kunze, from
his article ""Where Art Thou""</strong></p>
<p><strong>~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~</strong></p>
<p><strong><u>Risks &amp; Challenges</u></strong></p>
<p>I have been preparing for this journey, mentally and emotionally,
for a very long time. As far as going out on the road, the challenges
will depend on the level of funding support I am starting off with. I
am making this journey, regardless of the funding received from this
campaign. It is my hope that I am able to do it in the comfort and
security that comes with having a reliable motor home and a car to
tow behind. If that doesn't happen, I still know that I will be fine.
I am very resilient and no stranger to roughing it, or going without.
I look forward to traveling with abundance, ease and grace. Should
challenges arise I will meet them with faith. Which always gives me
great stories to tell about how Spirit works miracles to take care of
me.</p>
<p>My biggest personal challenge, is in dealing with the bureaucracy
but I have people who will take over that job for me, so I am not
worried about that part.</p>
<p>I am no stranger to RVing. My two boys  raced moto-cross for
several years so I spent every weekend RVing. I also worked several
years, in the 80s, on the production line, in RV plants. I have a
well rounded working knowledge of how the systems within the RV
function. 
</p>
<p>I am no stranger to selling my art, either. I provided for myself
and my kids, while raising them as a single mom, by selling my
jewelry in a wide variety of venues, between 1997 and 2006. Since
then I have continued to, periodically, do arts and craft shows.  I
have also maintained a cleaning business, for the past 8 years, in
which I implemented my energy healing abilities, with physical
cleaning and organizing work. You can find out more, about that and

My name is Angie Schuyler. I am a spiritual, visionary artist,
who's every creation is designed to bring healing to the people who
keep them, and the environment in which they reside. I am the
designer of Mystical Moment Healing Jewelry;
the creator of OrgoneART
and Vitality
Icons, which are orgonite creations that are used as meditation
tools and protection against electromagnetic frequencies (EMF's). I
am also the visionary behind the Recipro City, experimental gifting
economy, idea. My newest inspiration is PRmia
and this campaign is largely aimed at helping me launch this new line
of healing art. 


For all the information you may want, about all my different
artistic creations, my passions, and my projects, please go to my
Mystical Moment website, and follow all the different links across
the top of the page. Each project, or creation, has it's own page.

There is also a series of videos to be found HERE
that will give deeper explanations, of each project and healing and

to where it is now and am willing to risk even more because I don't
think it wise, to waste an answered prayer. I am stepping out in

*REVIEW* by Coloring Isn't Just for Kids
PRmia ART FOR COLORING By-Angie Schuyler. PRmia Art is a
22 page coloring book. Pages are all one sided. The paper is normal
thickness so you may need to add a piece of paper between the pages
for bleed through. The pictures in this coloring book are very
different and unique. I have never seen another coloring book like
this one. I cant wait to be able to sit down and color one of these
pages. A lot of coloring books look alike and or have a lot of the
same designs. If you want something different to color than this
coloring book is for you. Angie started drawing the art for these
coloring books on Feb 12th,2015. She has already created 2 coloring
books, PRmia Art for Coloring and PRmia Art for Coloring Book #2. She
is starting on book 3 and 4 but isn't going to bring those out until
the first 2 coloring books get up and going well but she says she is
prepared for that. Angie has been married to her husband Kevin for 5
years. Between the two of them they have 6 grown children and
(almost) 7 grand kids(one on the way). Angie has 2 pets, One is a
Chinchilla named Ziggy and the other is a male Beta Fish named
Rainbow. Angie is a Holistic Healer and she says she has people who
buy her coloring books just to contemplate the art and seek out
different shapes within it. Some simply like to trace the lines with
their fingers and they say it has a peaceful effect on them. The
healing aspect of the art is very important to Angie.

What I Need..... 

By choosing to support my project, you would allow me to purchase
the things I need, to launch this  and to do business, on the road.
This is my wish list, in order of priority. If I raise less than the
full amount, I will gratefully make do with what I am gifted and
adjust according to necessity and priority.
This is a list with approximate amounts and photographic
representations of the items I am looking to purchase.
*Art show display, with (weatherproof) tent  - $1000.
*Matting and framing, for several of my original drawings so I can
do some gallery shows- $500

*Inventory (coloring books, cards, t-shirts, bags, shoes, posters,
phone covers, etc.; all with my art on it and all for coloring on. -
$2000
*Art Show booth fees, for a year  - $1000

*Transportation and Lodging - this could take one of several different forms.
$1,000.00 if all I do is fix my car to make it safe and reliable,
and I live in a tent or hotel rooms.$4,500.00 if I fix the car and pay it off and still have my lodging be a tent or hotel rooms.
$20,000 would purchase a hauling vehicle and a tent trailer.
$24,500.00 would get me a high mileage motor home and fix and pay
off my car to tow behind.

$34,500.00 will fix and pay off my car, and purchase a low mileage
motor home, in excellent condition.(this would be my ultimate wish)
A motor home or trailer is very important to me.
I like to have my own space. Kind of like a turtle, I like to
carry my home with me, wherever I go. :-) This is an essential for
me. I really need, for my own well-being, to not have to stay in
hotels. I need a space to call my very own.
Should this project be over funded:

Should this project be over-funded, I will immediately hire a
financial professional, to handle bookkeeping and taxes. Then I'll
put the extra funds in a trust and start a not-for-profit for the
Recipro City project, which supports organic gardens and sustainable
living projects, as well as the creation of an economy that runs on
the law of reciprocity. Should it be over funded, by a million
dollars or more, I just might buy a particular property I am aware of
that would be the perfect location for my Recipro City style
eco-village / healing center / hermitage.
What You Get for Offering Your
Support..... 

 I am offering samples of my art, and products made with my art.
You can find all the incentives in boxes along the right side of
this page, near the top.
The Impact my Vision Can Make
I am only one person, yet I have much, in the way of healing
tools, inspiration, advice and vision, to offer the people, who's
paths I'll cross, along my ensuing journey.
I want to teach people, about energy work and the power of Love
and reciprocity, to heal and bring positive change. I want to share
about my experiences with Recipro City, so far. I also want to share
my ideas, for changing our economy into a kinder and gentler system
that cares for the needs of all, and does so in ways that help our
natural environment to heal and flourish.
I want to work, with the people I meet along my way, to continue
my Recipro City
experiment, by encouraging them to start Recipro
Stations, install neighborhood Share Sheds, and organize Share Fairs
and Gifting Markets.

I also want to encourage people to join the  ""I
Love You!"" movement.
I don't have any fancy education credentials to share with you.
Everything I have learned, and have to offer has been gifts of Spirit
or gained from personal experience and expressed through natural
talents. I have spent the past 15 years developing my intuition and
my various artistic expressions. Now, I am embarking on a journey
that will allow me to test my faith, in the way I was inspired by my
hero, Peace Pilgrim.
Peace Pilgrim was a woman who walked all over the US, for 28
years, going only on faith to provide for her, while she traveled
around talking to people about peace. My mission is different but I
know I have the faith to take me down the road!

TESTIMONIALS
""That art is transformative is certainly not new.
Religious artifacts and architecture in every culture are a testament
to this. But these are brand new times!........This strikes me as art
that’s meant to be used. Each image should be grasped and
manipulated with dexterity and vigor; they should be wrung out to see
what more might be squeezed from pulp and pits, even as our eternal
thirst seems momentarily quenched. It is the consumer of this art who
paradoxically comes to it as the unmolded clay… "" ~ Author ~
Niels Kunze from his article about the Prmia art ""Where Art
Thou""
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
I have found that coloring these awesome trance art pieces
has the ability to help me calm myself. I was feeling anxious, my
mind jumping from one ""must do"" thought to another. I
looked through the pages, searching for the image that appealed to me
most. I turned them this way and that. Suddenly, there it was! Once I
started to color the image, I found myself relaxing, my breathing
slowed and became deep and regular. My mind focused on choosing the
colors and finding the patterns, hidden within the picture, that
spoke to my subconscious mind. This is a wonderful tool to use to
help you wake up your imagination and journey deep into your inner
self.~ Tish Sanders
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
""I took some of Angie's wonderful drawings and I
colored them in with marker. I cannot tell you how relaxing and
connected they help me feel .. they relieve stress and they allowed
my imagination to soar . I love them....try it .. it is wonderful ..
coloring releases any stress I may be having .. I cannot say enough
about them !! "" ~ Carolyn L'Hommedieu
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
""Meditate… breathe… and then go grab your
crayons! This is artwork that begs to be defaced. Coloring is the
consummation of this marriage. The doodle-art progeny created are
novelty expressions, akin to your own DNA in their uniqueness. And
when you’re finished, it’s not so much that you’ve really
altered the original– it’s still there, underneath– but it’s
more that you put something of yourself into it, a giving of
self-expression… for the opportunity of claiming that expression AS
Self, tangibly… demonstrably."" ~ Author ~ Niels Kunze, from
his article ""Where Art Thou""
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
Risks & Challenges
I have been preparing for this journey, mentally and emotionally,
for a very long time. As far as going out on the road, the challenges
will depend on the level of funding support I am starting off with. I
am making this journey, regardless of the funding received from this
campaign. It is my hope that I am able to do it in the comfort and
security that comes with having a reliable motor home and a car to
tow behind. If that doesn't happen, I still know that I will be fine.
I am very resilient and no stranger to roughing it, or going without.
I look forward to traveling with abundance, ease and grace. Should
challenges arise I will meet them with faith. Which always gives me
great stories to tell about how Spirit works miracles to take care of
me.
My biggest personal challenge, is in dealing with the bureaucracy
but I have people who will take over that job for me, so I am not
worried about that part.
I am no stranger to RVing. My two boys  raced moto-cross for
several years so I spent every weekend RVing. I also worked several
years, in the 80s, on the production line, in RV plants. I have a
well rounded working knowledge of how the systems within the RV
function. 

I am no stranger to selling my art, either. I provided for myself
and my kids, while raising them as a single mom, by selling my
jewelry in a wide variety of venues, between 1997 and 2006. Since
then I have continued to, periodically, do arts and craft shows.  I
have also maintained a cleaning business, for the past 8 years, in
which I implemented my energy healing abilities, with physical
cleaning and organizing work. You can find out more, about that and
look at some of my references, by clicking the Good
Vibes tab on my Mystical Moment website www.mystical-moment.com/
Other Ways You Can Help
I understand that not everyone is able to help with $s , but that
doesn't mean you can't be a huge help to me.
You can still help, by getting the word out and making some noise
about my campaign The Indiegogo share tools are easy and convenient
to use!

Thank You! Thank You! Thank You! I appreciate, very much, you
taking the time to read and to consider giving your support!




I reserve the right to go
		with the flow and shift directions, as the path unfolds before me.


I Love You ALL!I expect a miracle now!

At the same time this art form gives me ability to say that I’m improving the main historical principal of paintings: exposing three dimensions in two dimensions, this is exactly word by word explaining what I do, in my art.I’m working on 3D art, 2 years already and I want to make huge jump this year in this direction, to start painting huge figures in different dimensions and create huge paintings. I think that this should be the art of the XXI century, we all want to see something new and my soul needs to create something that will encourage people to be better than they are thinking of themselves. I think that art should make world the better place and for me it is very important to show the idea and concept of painting. By Kanye 3D  portraits I want to make some kind of iconography of new age, to mention that this person Kaney West made huge difference.

<p><span>The TextielLab offers a rare blend of old and new technology through access to cutting edge equipment and collection of textiles. We are the only students from the US to ever be accepted to produce projects at this facility. This opportunity is incredibly exciting because there are only a handful of places in the world offering access to computerized textile production equipment to independent artists. For a period of 8 production days, we will each be working with our own dedicated technician and machine. This period is known as development stage, after which point the facility with produce the final body of work. </span></p>
<p>Without this funding our projects will not be possible without a large financial burden put on the group. Even if we hit the $10,000 goal, we will not personally be compensated. Every dollar raised will go directly to seeing these projects succeed from start to finish. More broadly, we see this as an opportunity to pursue our largest projects to date.</p>We hope that with your help we can make this a reality.</div> <div> <h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3> <p> </p>
</div><p><span style=""color: rgb(106, 106, 106); font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif; letter-spacing: 0px; background-color: initial;"">As members of the Textile Technology Research group, we have met on a weekly basis for the last year to continue to move our projects forward, fundraise, organize outside events, and bring notoriety to the group. We are deeply invested in completing these projects, and securing funds for development and production is the final hurdle.</span><br/></p>Once we are at the TextielLab, we will have to tackle language barriers, technical difficulties, time and material constraints. The TextielLab has only quoted us for development costs. Once we determine scale, materiality and finishing, the TextielLab will give us a quote for Production costs. This is a complete unknown. Making this a highly risky endeavor.<div>

Short Summary 
 The TTRG began with Isaac Facio and Heather Mackenzie building interest and collaboration around the nature of craft, research, and invention that strives to create a collective of expertise across the arts and sciences through mentorship, curatorial and technical collaborations, exhibitions, and outreach within the areas of textiles and fiber-based media. The TTRG also includes collaborators Joyce Lee Safe and Erika Rae.


This project has been a year in the making through multiple grant applications, public presentations, symposiums, culminating in an exhibition. With the support of an EAGER Grant from SAIC’s Earl and Brenda Shapiro Center for Research and Collaboration, we were able to fund the initial applications to the TextielLab. The Fiber and Material Studies department has also generously sponsored our accommodations while in Tilburg. 
Responding to her cultural heritage, Melissa Leandro experiments with 
the interlacements between off-the-grid embroidery and jacquard weaving 
in Una Parte de la Multitud,  A Part of the Multitude. Through the 
abstract depiction of landscapes, she maps relationships between 
elements in space, like objects, landmasses, and cultural identities. As
 she invents a unique and technical language of symbols and fractured 
objects, she aims to develop physical translations between weaving, 
embroidery, and drawing. 
Sasha de Koninck studies self-awareness with responsive knitted architecture in textiles for clothing in Garments for Uncomfortable Social Situations. Investigating textile structures, she uses a waffle knit structure to build a three dimensional textile that responds as a pressure sensor. She creates a multisensory experience, through the research and development of smart textile material for the body that is intimate, sensitive and loud. 
Melissa and Sasha have been accepted to produce their projects at the TextielLab in Tilburg, the Netherlands. We are the first US students to be accepted to the TextielLab.

    The Impact 
The TextielLab offers a rare blend of old and new technology through access to cutting edge equipment and collection of textiles. We are the only students from the US to ever be accepted to produce projects at this facility. This opportunity is incredibly exciting because there are only a handful of places in the world offering access to computerized textile production equipment to independent artists. For a period of 8 production days, we will each be working with our own dedicated technician and machine. This period is known as development stage, after which point the facility with produce the final body of work. 
Without this funding our projects will not be possible without a large financial burden put on the group. Even if we hit the $10,000 goal, we will not personally be compensated. Every dollar raised will go directly to seeing these projects succeed from start to finish. More broadly, we see this as an opportunity to pursue our largest projects to date.We hope that with your help we can make this a reality.  Risks & Challenges  
As members of the Textile Technology Research group, we have met on a weekly basis for the last year to continue to move our projects forward, fundraise, organize outside events, and bring notoriety to the group. We are deeply invested in completing these projects, and securing funds for development and production is the final hurdle.Once we are at the TextielLab, we will have to tackle language barriers, technical difficulties, time and material constraints. The TextielLab has only quoted us for development costs. Once we determine scale, materiality and finishing, the TextielLab will give us a quote for Production costs. This is a complete unknown. Making this a highly risky endeavor.

<div><p><span style=""background-color: initial;"">Hello!  My name is Adam Benson.  I'm a visual effects artist, musician, writer and digital paint artist.  I am putting together a calendar based on a series of Pinup Girl drawings that I have done specifically for this reason.  These drawings are the culmination of a years worth of work. The idea to make a calendar came to me when I finished a drawing that I had been working on for several weeks.  I really liked the outcome and I decided to go ahead and make a total of 12 drawings for a 2016 Calendar.  That was in October of 2014.  At the time I knew it would be too difficult to get 12 drawings done in time for 2015, so I've spent most of the rest of the year working on each of these drawings for a pre-2016 release.</span></p></div>

 Once I have the calendars printed and the marketing and sales begin, I will be donating 25% of all proceeds to Breast Cancer and Alzheimer's Disease research.  In the grand scheme of things this could mean several thousand dollars of donations to causes that really need the research support that they deserve.  To be clear, the money raised here is only for printing and marketing costs, the charitable donations will be part of the eventual sale of the printed materials.  Fortunately, the cost of printing should be a drop in the bucket in eventual money raised for these important contributions.  Your donation to this campaign will be a pre-sale of the eventual completed calendar, and thus cover the cost of publishing these globally.  
                                                               This campaign should be very low risk, because copies will be printed no matter how much money is raised here.  I may not get the full 1000 copies printed, but any and all money raised here will be going toward the printing of these calendars.  One of the drawbacks to printing is that the numbers get exponentially smaller the more copies that you get printed, so even if partial funds are raised, the printing costs will still be substantial.  That doesn't mean that they won't get printed, it just means that fewer copies would be printed, and thus less money will be going to charities that need our support.  On the plus side, selling 1000 copies globally should be a non-issue.  The market for pinup girl calendars already exists, and if this campaign is successful, then future copies will be easy enough to procure using money raised from calendar sales.
    


 Even if you don't have the funds to contribute, please spread the word.  I would really like to get these printed for people to enjoy and to raise money for Breast Cancer Research and Alzheimer's Disease Research.  Whether you contribute or not I would greatly appreciate you passing this on to anyone else that you think might be interested!
Thank you very much for your support!",31.0,0,"1 Campaign

TRANSPERSONAL 
PSYCHOLOGY
Transpersonal psychology  Is a
sub-field of psychology that integrates the spiritual and transcendent aspects
of the human experience with the framework of modern psychology. The transpersonal is defined as
""experiences in which the sense of identity or self extends beyond (trans)
the individual or personal”; experiences or events that allow you to live a
bigger and more meaningful reality.
Researchers
of Transpersonal Psychology are concerned with the study of humanity's highest
potential, and with the recognition, understanding, and realization of
unifying, spiritual, and transcendent states of consciousness. Due to its
methodology and contents, Transpersonal Psychology is considered to be within
the framework of Humanistic Psychology and Self-development. It gives us a
different understanding of the psychic, health, illness and self and social
development.
MAGIC TRUFFLES
Magic truffles are edible mushrooms with
hallucinogenic properties that contain the psychedelic compounds psilocybin and
psilocin. 

Dr. Timothy
Leary, Ralph Mentzner, Ram Dass: “The
Psychedelic experience, a manual based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead.” 
This manual
gives you clear steps on how to plan a psychedelic session, and helps you
prepare yourself for a mystical, personal and group experience based on the
tibetan model.
There are
four main points you can achieve with the intake of magic truffles:
  •  A bigger sense of personal power and
intellectual comprehension; sharper intuition of the self and culture; bigger
professional efficiency and fast learning.
  •  A sense of obligation and empathy towards
others as well as the will to help your fellow mates during their process of
rebirth.
  •  Recreational use, aesthetic and sensual
pleasure, interpersonal approach and pure experience.
  •  Transcendence, letting go of  the ego and the space-time limit and mystical
union.

I love traveling as much as photography. Last half a year I spent in Southeast Asia, now my favorite region. I was traveling, doing photos and trying to understand life there. 

When I came back to my native Ukraine I realized that people  are lacking something here.
I often meet people who want to travel but can't because of certain circumstances. They smile to me and tell me that they are envy.
But instead of it I want them to be inspired, I want them to see and to feel what I feel and get their motivation.
 In the Internet you can see lots of travel pictures, but most of them don't have any soul, they are empty. My photos don't look like usual travel photos. I do my best to see through my soul, through my eyes and then, I try to frame what I saw  into my pictures. 

My desire to share everything what I get from traveling and to make people travel, was the reason I started the project.

together international artists, scientists, innovators and educators of all
disciplines who collectively explore remote destinations in the Arctic aboard an ice-class sailing vessel. </p>
<p><b>The mission of The Arctic Circle
Residency:</b> “The Arctic Circle is a nexus where art intersects science, architecture,
education, and activism, -an incubator for thought and experimentation for
artists and innovators who seek out and foster areas of collaboration to engage
in the central issues of our time.”</p>
<p><b>About my work and my intentions
for the residency program:</b></p>
<p>Over the last six months I have
been researching and exploring the notion of the sublime while attempting to
understand and share it through visual art. On a quest to experience the
sublime I have found myself on the ice fields and glaciers of Alaska and in the
depths of the Pacific Ocean.  My
experiences in extreme remote environments provides the inspiration and the
material for my artwork, and conducting work in the Arctic Circle will be the
ultimate landscape to work from. </p>
<p>Not only will I make work
surrounding the sublime, I will also make work that is central to threatening environmental
issues of our time including global climate change (more specifically, the
rapid melting of glaciers), and the disappearance of ecosystems that are home
to a diversity of plants and animals. My most recent piece exhibited in
Singapore, focused on rising sea levels as a result of melting glaciers and its
effects on small-populated tropical islands like Singapore.  </p>
<p>My time in the arctic will be
spent collecting material using video, photography, sculpture, and writing which
I will transform into works of art that will be exhibited and published. While
I plan on creating a video installation and a number of sculptures, I will go
with an open mind to avoid limiting myself. I plan to publish writings about my
work and experiences in the Leonardo Journal of Art, Science and Technology. I
will also participate in collaborations aboard the ship.</p>
<p>Concurrently, as a plant
ecophysiologist, I am interested in studying the flora of the area and
observing how these harsh environmental conditions have shaped the morphology
and physiology of these plants.</p>
<p>Finally, as an educator at the
intersection of art and science, I look forward to collaborating with others to develop ideas for a unique
curriculum to share with future students. </p>
<p>Bringing awareness and appreciation
of the richness, fragility, and the sublime of our planet to others is my
mission and right now it is absolutely critical. This is not only vital for
human kind, but for all species, for all of 
planet Earth. By helping me, you will play a vital role in this mission.

<p>I am trying to raise $7500. </p>
<p>The cost of this prestigious
residency is $13,000. I'm trying to raise $7,500. Of this amount, $6,500  will go towards paying the residency fees and $1000 goes

<p>I am a creative image-maker based in Johannesburg, South Africa,  where I work as a conceptual portraiture and fashion photographer. I am passionate about travel, yoga, the art of storytelling, and unraveling the ""Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything"". And I have my doubts that the answer is 42.</p>

<h3>What is the Arteles Artist Residency?</h3>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1468175722/ei9v9thhh5c3mdypd0ju.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<p>An artist residency is a creative space in which artists can focus on producing a new body of work. The Arteles Creative Center in Finland offers 1-2 month stays at their small holding set in the extraordinary nature of the Hämeenkyrö region, which offers a peaceful environment for inspired thinking. Approximately one hundred artists, writers and researchers from around the world are invited to attend annually. I am very excited to have been selected as one of them!</p>

<h3>My Project: ""Human. Nature.""</h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1468178435/hhzq5erjsn88zdnuuav8.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>During this residency I want to further my studies into human nature, the evolution of mankind and our natural place in the eco-system vs the current detachment that has become a world-wide epidemic.</p>
<p>I first started exploring organic morphology and transformation in the series “Breathe in… Breathe out… Let the human in…” (2015), adding natural elements from the ocean to point towards evolution and the ever-evolving state of the human existence. When you look at the veins in your hand, to those in a leaf, to the cracks in the dessert floor, there is an underlying pattern that connects us all. But it goes even deeper than this.</p>
<p><strong>Consider the human being as a part of the Universe. We are star dust. All matter made up of the very same protons, neutrons and electrons. In fact, you can even picture the atom as a miniature Solar System, with the nucleus playing the role of a Sun orbited by electrons as planets. The pattern of these atoms are repeated within and without the human form, stretching through the very fabric of space-time.</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p>The intention of the proposed work is to make the viewer reconsider his every day existence and place in the natural world.</p>
<p>To this cause I applied to the Arteles residency, as it offers a natural landscape for me to work with. I intend to explore the surroundings, photographing both myself and aspects of the environment fused together to portray our connection. My love for hiking will take me deep into the forests for theses creative sessions. By mounting my camera on a tripod and using the intervalometer setting, I will be able to move around in the landscape to capture myself in the scene. I will also be crafting accessories from the natural materials to introduce into the images.</p>
<p>My visit is during the Autumn, better known in Finland as the “Ruska”. I am hoping for rich colour palettes of reds and golds for this series. Other perks of this season include misty mornings, and the harvesting of wild berries and mushrooms… all which I intend to feature. </p>
<p>Over the last year I have been studying the effects of Automatism, a technique developed during the Surrealist movement that shifted creation from conscious control to chance. This has led to an interest in the spontaneity of in-camera effects, like multiple exposure and motion blur. These techniques will be combined with photo-manipulation in post-production, to create dream-like images illustrating the key concepts from my studies.</p>

<h3>What I Need</h3>
<p>Naturally I am over the moon to have been given this opportunity, especially considering that the institution has granted me 50% funding on the residency fee valued at 970 Euros!

As such I would greatly appreciate your support towards the following budget:</p>
<p>Visa Application €60<br/>International Travel €925<br/>Domestic Travel €100<br/>Residency Fee (50%) €970<br/>Food for 32 days €600<br/>Materials for project €500<br/>Thermal Clothing €250<br/>Microscope Camera €1200</p>
<p><strong>Total   €4605</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please note that to enable Credit Card Payments on this campaign costs and perks have been calculated in US Dollar.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Total $5100</strong></p>
<p>I intend to follow through with the residency regardless of the outcome of the campaign.</p>

</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The Arteles residency will provide me with an opportunity to step away from the city noise into a calm and peaceful environment ideal for reflection and creation. I believe that the concepts I intend to study and illustrate through my work are pertinent to us all, not only on an individual level, but also in light of our shared consciousness.  </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Although I have not previously attended a residency, I hope that this will be the first of many to come. I have built a successful photographic business over the last seven years. My work has received several awards, and I have been published both nationally and internationally. I am also brand ambassador for Photon studio equipment and Vanguard tripods and bags. </p>
<p>I do not foresee many challenges to the project. That said, it is very rainy in Finland in the month of October, but I intend to include the weather into the work come rain or shine. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>I am currently looking for an exhibition space to show the work upon my return.</p>
<p>I appreciate your interest and support, and understand that not everyone can contribute financially.

<br/><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">About the Book:</h3>
<div>_________________________________________________________________________</div>
<div>The Dream Quest was a book that started as a whimsical inking while I was day dreaming on the job. A girl mysteriously making what looked to be the beginning of a great journey through a thick jungle, heading towards a distant mountain. </div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1468298339/climb_1_small_ucvzpz.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div>
<div>Immediately friends and colleagues began to comment on the illustration, and after a wonderful party at a friend's place where I took out my sketch book to show a new friend the progress of what at the time I had envisioned as a graphic novel, it dawned on me that this whimsical fantasy had a lot more to it than just one detailed page of wonder. </div>
<div>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1467558541/SAmple_Book_page_2_apbmij.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<br/>
</div>
<div>Thus after months of dedicating many hours of inking, thinking and dreaming, the story of the little girl on a quest finally has come full circle, and I am eager to turn what is currently several pages of inkings a several more digital pages of inking into a beautiful paperback book that you can have to colour, read and enjoy!</div>

UPDATES: Check the Picture Gallery above for new images!! I have added Segment #2 - The Dive!!!

About the Book:
_________________________________________________________________________
The Dream Quest was a book that started as a whimsical inking while I was day dreaming on the job. A girl mysteriously making what looked to be the beginning of a great journey through a thick jungle, heading towards a distant mountain. 




Immediately friends and colleagues began to comment on the illustration, and after a wonderful party at a friend's place where I took out my sketch book to show a new friend the progress of what at the time I had envisioned as a graphic novel, it dawned on me that this whimsical fantasy had a lot more to it than just one detailed page of wonder. 




Thus after months of dedicating many hours of inking, thinking and dreaming, the story of the little girl on a quest finally has come full circle, and I am eager to turn what is currently several pages of inkings a several more digital pages of inking into a beautiful paperback book that you can have to colour, read and enjoy!




The story is completely wordless as I feel that to for every person who receives this book the dream quest will be different for them, based on their interpretation, and I want to preserve that place of peace where you can travel with the girl, define for yourself what the nature of each out come is, and find yourself, as she finally does, in full circle after completing the book, and perhaps find out something unique about yourself, as the girl does in the process of the journey.

I didn’t want to bulldoze this piece of Milesburg history—this house belonged to Abigail Miles, cousin of the town founder—but I couldn’t save it as a house. After much worrying, dreaming, and drawing, the idea to preserve the façade in concrete was born. That plan has grown to include donating property for Homecoming Park and salvaging a stone fireplace that was hidden in the walls. </i></p><p style=""margin-left:40px;""><i>~ Benjamin Fehl</i></p><p> </p><h3>the journey...</h3><p>This community art project grew out of my graduate studies in both architecture and art.  In both programs I spent a great deal of time exploring the concept of what home means to us; The Crooked House project developed from this.   The real story takes place over a decade of research, planning and hard work. The project involves not only creating a concrete casting of the front of the historic house and repointing the stone fireplace to be a freestanding hearth, but also dedicating the property around where the house stood as a public park—Homecoming Park.  </p><p>I started on this journey back in 2004 as an artist with an idea. Over the years I’ve had the good fortune of gathering a team of volunteers and supporters, known as Friends of The Crooked House.</p><p>These friends have joined me in 1,000s of hours of work—dismantling the house, preserving the façade, repointing a 160 year-old fireplace and excavating the foundation. They’ve donated their expertise, money, materials, the use of heavy machinery, and time to bring The Crooked House to this point</p><p>We have a hard deadline of March 2017 to finish the project. Since 2011, the project has been funded with several small grants, donations, and discounts, as well as using my savings to pay for skilled labor and essential materials.  Slow and cheap has meant the best use of project resources…up to now. </p><p><i>We need your help to purchase the materials to cast the sculpture.</i></p><p> </p><h3><strong>We’re ready to cast it and install.   </strong></h3><p>The finish line is in sight.  <strong>To meet the borough deadline of March 2017</strong>, <strong>we must raise $40,000 for materials to mold, cast and install the sculpture</strong>. It sounds like a lot of cash. But thanks to ongoing grants (since 2011) from the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts, plus a grant from the Puffin Foundation, and generous donations of labor, materials and funds by Friends of The Crooked House, 2/3 of this $120,000 project is already complete. The last hurdle to clear is the purchase of materials to create and install the sculpture. <strong> You can be a patron of the arts, receive a tax deduction for your donation,</strong> <strong>and support arts access</strong> for rural communities by funding some of the materials to cast The Crooked House in concrete. </p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472011979/xickwh6vc7spx7vwse0w.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><h2> </h2><h1>What’s the $40k for?</h1><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472009481/zverd5qmijyo8whqirfw.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p><p> </p><h3>What happens if we exceed our goal?</h3><p>Any funds raised beyond the cost of completing and installing The Crooked House sculpture will be used for Homecoming Park to purchase materials to landscape and secure the park (fencing, brick pavers, trees and plants, park benches…).</p><p> </p><h3>What happens if we don’t meet our goal?</h3><p>All funds donated will be used for the project.</p><p>Benjamin says ""I don’t really want to think about that too much—we have a deadline and must meet it.

I didn’t want to bulldoze this piece of Milesburg history—this house belonged to Abigail Miles, cousin of the town founder—but I couldn’t save it as a house. After much worrying, dreaming, and drawing, the idea to preserve the façade in concrete was born. That plan has grown to include donating property for Homecoming Park and salvaging a stone fireplace that was hidden in the walls. ~ Benjamin Fehl the journey...This community art project grew out of my graduate studies in both architecture and art.  In both programs I spent a great deal of time exploring the concept of what home means to us; The Crooked House project developed from this.   The real story takes place over a decade of research, planning and hard work. The project involves not only creating a concrete casting of the front of the historic house and repointing the stone fireplace to be a freestanding hearth, but also dedicating the property around where the house stood as a public park—Homecoming Park.  I started on this journey back in 2004 as an artist with an idea. Over the years I’ve had the good fortune of gathering a team of volunteers and supporters, known as Friends of The Crooked House.These friends have joined me in 1,000s of hours of work—dismantling the house, preserving the façade, repointing a 160 year-old fireplace and excavating the foundation. They’ve donated their expertise, money, materials, the use of heavy machinery, and time to bring The Crooked House to this pointWe have a hard deadline of March 2017 to finish the project. Since 2011, the project has been funded with several small grants, donations, and discounts, as well as using my savings to pay for skilled labor and essential materials.  Slow and cheap has meant the best use of project resources…up to now. We need your help to purchase the materials to cast the sculpture. We’re ready to cast it and install.   The finish line is in sight.  To meet the borough deadline of March 2017, we must raise $40,000 for materials to mold, cast and install the sculpture. It sounds like a lot of cash. But thanks to ongoing grants (since 2011) from the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts, plus a grant from the Puffin Foundation, and generous donations of labor, materials and funds by Friends of The Crooked House, 2/3 of this $120,000 project is already complete. The last hurdle to clear is the purchase of materials to create and install the sculpture.  You can be a patron of the arts, receive a tax deduction for your donation, and support arts access for rural communities by funding some of the materials to cast The Crooked House in concrete.   What’s the $40k for? What happens if we exceed our goal?Any funds raised beyond the cost of completing and installing The Crooked House sculpture will be used for Homecoming Park to purchase materials to landscape and secure the park (fencing, brick pavers, trees and plants, park benches…). What happens if we don’t meet our goal?All funds donated will be used for the project.Benjamin says ""I don’t really want to think about that too much—we have a deadline and must meet it. If we don’t raise the money, I start applying for loans and continue to apply for grants. (Can you recommend an art-friendly banker?)"" Project History
