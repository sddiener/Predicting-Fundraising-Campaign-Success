<h3>Who Are You and What is Salt Assault?</h3>
<p>My name is Ryan Dombrowski, founder of Doombrowski and creator of Salt Assault. I've been working on tabletop games and video games very heavily for about 3 years now and feel that I finally have something that's ready to be shared with the world. <br/><br/>Salt Assault is a game designed to make people laugh. It lets people feel the power of controlling an argument and putting the icing on top of a successfully won argument with a myriad of insults. It's a game that has been tested to many crowds with abundant laughter every playthrough. You get to tell people to F*** Off, call people names like A**hat, and make people salty. What's not to love?</p>
<p>By helping fund Salt Assault, you will be bringing my childhood dream of producing a card game to life. If this campaign is successfully funded, the game will be able to be printed and distributed across the nation. That would be super awesome. Be warned that if this game is successfully funded, I will probably cry like a little b****.<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1514862119/zmonjhpygsqswlllwrr3.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Why $4000? That's a kind of weird number.</h3>
<p>$4000 is the number needed to print and package the first wave of decks for Salt Assault. When printing games, large quantities are necessary to keep the finished product affordable. I have price checked multiple print shops and am confident that with $4000, I can have enough copies printed to hit a good price point on the finished product. <br/><br/>If you help fund Salt Assault, you will be given instant access to a pdf version of the game. You can print and play right away! Your name will also be included in a special backer section of the Salt Assault game webpage. Copies of the game will also be available at and above the $15 donation mark if the game is successfully funded.<br/><br/>If for whatever reason the $4000 goal is not reached, any funds gained will go into the Doombrowski LLC account to be put towards future game making and distributing endeavors. It's very possible that, depending on the amount gained, I will still find a way to make this game happen. Regardless if the game is printed or not, you will have access to the pdf of the game so you can still print and play it. :)<br/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1514862209/nopm2wx9bxtjqxez6gve.png"" src=""""/></p>

<h3>Sprinkle the Salt</h3>
<p>I love making people laugh. Laughter feels good. This game is a possible way to spread the joy of laughter to the masses.

<h3>What is Lenormand? And who is Little Lulu?</h3>
<p>Lenormand is a 200 year-old card divination system similar to Tarot... but much simpler and more suited to practical everyday life matters!</p>
<ul>
<li>36 card deck featuring simple key images and associated meanings.</li>
<li>No knowledge in Tarot, astrology, or other esoteric systems necessary.</li>
<li>Straightforward and beginner-friendly; penetrating and insightful.</li>
</ul>
<p>Who is Little Lulu though? Vintage Lenormand decks would often come with a small guidebook written by a celebrated psychic or card reader of the time. Little Lulu is a sassy, contemporary homage to these Lenormand sages (both real and fictional) of the past.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What I Need &amp; What Little Lulu Will Deliver</h3>
<p>Little Lulu's Lucky Lenormand is ready to be printed in its first full edition. Yay! But printing a full edition of custom decks in a cost-effective number is expensive... yikes! (See FAQ's)  So to help get Little Lulu out into the world I'm asking for your support:</p>
<ul>
<li>The total budget from start to finish for the first edition of Little Lulu's Lucky Lenormand is $7280. I have already invested $900 of my own funds into the initial design, proofing, and marketing stage. I am hoping to cover the remaining $6780 of printing and production costs through pre-sales and your support of this Indiegogo campaign. </li>
<li>Through this campaign you can pre-order a copy of the Little Lulu Lucky Lenormand first edition for $4 off the retail price. There's also a special ""Game of Hope"" package that presents Little Lulu's Lucky Lenormand in a satin bag with a custom spread cloth, 2 beautiful dice, and rules to the Victorian-era game that the first Lenormand deck was based on!</li>
<li>I have a super big wish goal above and beyond the initial goal... if we can surpass the initial goal and reach the stretch goal too, I may be able to have every copy of Little Lulu's Lucky Lenormand include the dice and game instructions for ""The Game of Hope!"" FINGERS CROSSED!!!</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>I am an artist and Tarot card reader based in Kansas City. I am passionate about the history of cartomancy (the art of reading cards) and designing card decks for a variety of purposes. Little Lulu's Lucky Lenormand is my second completed original deck and will be the first deck I've produced for sale through shops and local retailers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lenormand is an incredibly useful and insightful card system and Little Lulu's Lucky Lenormand reflects a contemporary sensibility with the classic structure of the original deck.</li>
<li>My first complete original deck was The Paris Tarot which I funded a VERY small edition of here through Indiegogo in 2017! Aw... The Paris Tarot is a toddler now!</li>
<li>I am a full-time Tarot reader and artist. I am writing publications on cartomancy as well as designing new decks that are versatile and can be used as playing card games with introspective meditation-style readings. Cartomancy is a living and evolving art form and I'm so grateful to have the opportunity to contribute to its continuation.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>This isn't my first time producing a deck. And the design and proofing process are complete. The booklet and ""Game of Hope"" spread cloth are being finalized now and are set to be ready before the campaign ends. The proof copy of Little Lulu's Lucky Lenormand is a colorful reminder of my initial goal to create a Lenormand deck suitable to use with my own clients! But this is also the largest campaign I have run to-date. So here's what I'm doing to help ensure that I've got my end of the deal covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'm keeping the campaign simple. My goal and focus is to be able to produce the first edition in a cost-effective number so that it may be sold in stores.</li>
<li>I'm researching my best options for packaging and shipping as efficiently and cost-effectively as possible to make sure that delivery doesn't get hung up on my end! Little Lulu has no intention of being Late Lulu.</li>
<li>I've been researching and following project campaigns by fellow card-designers and learning from their successes and challenges. </li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>Little Lulu's Lucky Lenormand can use your support in any capacity! With your help and a little luck, Little Lulu will find her way to those who could use her insight.</p>
<ul>
<li>Please share the campaign with friends and family you think would enjoy it!</li>
<li>Indiegogo has lots of handy-dandy share tools to help spread the word about this campaign.</li>
<li>Give the project a like and a shout out! I truly appreciate </li>
</ul>
</div><p>I am so grateful for all of the love and support I've already received for this project. I hope you will join me and follow-along on Little Lulu's journey! (Yes.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>I am a dedicated tabletop gamer and long time hobbyist who generally finds as much enjoyment in creating fun things as I do playing games. With the accessibility of 3D printers growing daily there has never been a better time to be a tabletop gamer and it is with that thought in mind that I started developing my own range of printable models. I'm a fan of both fantasy and sci-fi games but I decided to start here as I intend to use these tiles myself to create a vault for the Fallout miniatures game and as part of my Alien vs Predator games.</p>
<p>This campaign will contain every tile needed to create awesome looking vaults or spaceships plus some highly detailed scatter terrain to populate your rooms and corridors. To start with there are a total of 29 unique tiles ranging from basic walls and corridors to stairs, doors and balcony pieces.  A further 19 pieces of scatter terrain are currently completed including unique pieces such as a portal (stargate anybody?) and a selection of modular console units. All of the files are tested on a cheap stock Anet A8 printer and are designed to be fully support-less for ultimate ease of printing </p>
<p>Throughout the campaign I will continue to create more tiles and tile variants to expand upon the possibilities of the space-lock system as well as creating more interesting scatter. </p>
<p>As this is my first project I am keeping the project goal low with the aim of developing an ever expanding range of 3D printable products. All funding raised will go towards the development of new models as well as test printing any prototypes prior to release. During the funding period  I will continue to create and test print new tiles and scatter which will all be included as free extras for all supporters, I will also take any requests you have into consideration so that we can work together to create better looking games that people really do want to play.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Space-lock tiles are a system of interlocking modular tiles that dont require any small clips or fragile connectors to stay locked in place. The system supports multi level buildings and can be used to create solid tables without any voids or as a series of winding tunnels and rooms for all manner of modern and science fiction games. The tiles feature an integrated 1 inch square sytem without impacting the quality of the design and have been made to work equally well with both 28mm and 32mm scale miniatures although they can be scaled up or down as desired (I bet they look great printed on a photon at 25% scale now i think about it). So far all of the listed tiles and scatter terrain have been finished guarateeing each supporter will receive a great selection of files for creating truly epic scenery.  </p>
<p>To keep things simple there will be only 3 perks consisting of a early bird personal use perk, a standard personal use perk and a commercial use perk which will allow people to sell their prints for a one off licence fee for as long as they wish which will be ideal for startup printing businesses and larger print companies alike. All 3 perks will include everything that is currently finished plus any new models that are made during the campaign ensuring you get the best possible deal.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561395149/ovadi3c59i6c7jubzx83.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>The following pictures are of the finished tiles and scatter as well as renders of various pieces I have yet to print. All of the tiles are printed with a 0.3 layer height using a 0.4 nozzle on a stock anet A8, all scatter is printed on the same machine using a 0.2 layer height. All of the models have been designed to be printed without supports although the 2 doors and portal has some sagging at the very top of the opening if bridging isn't turned on in the slicer. GW models are included for scale.</p>
<p>One thing to note is that all of the tiles are in their clean and undamaged states although I am currently working on some damaged and alien versions to add more variety which I hope to include in this campaign. </p>

<p>I will continue to update this section with more pictures of the finished prints throughout the funding period as well as an in depth look at each tile and piece of scatter terrain. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>Licence Options</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Space lock terrain will be available with two different licences covering both personal and commercial use.</p>
<p>The personal use licence is ideal if you want to print the files for your own use. This means the files or finished prints can not be profited from in any way including but not limited to selling painted or raw prints, printing the files as part of a service or editing the files or prints in any way.</p>
<p>The commercial licence is aimed at people that wish to sell their epic printed terrain. This does not allow you to profit from or distribute the files, either original or edited versions including modified ""remixed"" versions without prior written permission from myself. With this licence you can print and sell any of the tiles or scatter terrain released during this campaign (including any models released as part of the campaign which are completed after the funding date). The cost of the licence during this campaign is exclusive to this campaign and is a single fee granting you lifetime rights to profit from the printing of all files presented in this campaign. </p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you have any questions regarding the licences please contact me and I will be happy to help.</p>

<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>This project will hopefully be the first of many if all goes well with the end goal of creating a great range of modular terrain and scatter terrain. With your support I will be able to continue creating awesome stuff for enhancing our collective gaming experiences while enjoying doing what I love.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>There will be no risks or major challenges associated with this campaign as I have already done all of the hard work designing the files listed above. After a lot of thought I can only identify a couple of potential challenges although I believe I already have possible solutions for them should they arise.</p>
<p>- Firstly there is the possibility that my printer develops some sort of mechanical problem during test printing. Anybody that owns at least one printer knows that this is always a very real threat but if this does happen I am fortunate enough to have a backup printer should I need it and I am sure one or two of the project supporters would be generous enough to help out too.</p>
<p>- The next potential challenge is with possible delays relating to the creation of future models throughout the campaign. This is a purely theoretical challenge but if one of you suggests a design which proves difficult to create I have decided the best course of action is to move the problem model to the end of the ""to do"" list while I focus on any other outstanding creations. Everything available during the campaign will be uploaded to an online drive for easy access which will be added to as new models are made and test printed, this will stop any outstanding creations from having an effect on the availability of the already finished models.</p>
<p>If there is anything you think I may have missed I would love to hear your thoughts or any questions you might have, I am pretty confident that I have covered all angles but any and all input would be greatly appreciated no matter how minor it may seem.</p>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p> </p>
<p>I understand that not everybody is in a situation where they may be able to contribute financially but even a simple share on social media would be greatly appreciated and it really would help, even reading this is helping out so if you've made it this far thank you!</p>
<p>A lot of people also don't own or have access to a 3D printer so if you know of any commercial printers who would be interested in a licence to sell space-lock terrain I would also really appreciate it if you share this campaign with them to help make these models as accessable as possible for gamers everywhere. </p>
</div></div>","Short Summary
I am a dedicated tabletop gamer and long time hobbyist who generally finds as much enjoyment in creating fun things as I do playing games. With the accessibility of 3D printers growing daily there has never been a better time to be a tabletop gamer and it is with that thought in mind that I started developing my own range of printable models. I'm a fan of both fantasy and sci-fi games but I decided to start here as I intend to use these tiles myself to create a vault for the Fallout miniatures game and as part of my Alien vs Predator games.
This campaign will contain every tile needed to create awesome looking vaults or spaceships plus some highly detailed scatter terrain to populate your rooms and corridors. To start with there are a total of 29 unique tiles ranging from basic walls and corridors to stairs, doors and balcony pieces.  A further 19 pieces of scatter terrain are currently completed including unique pieces such as a portal (stargate anybody?) and a selection of modular console units. All of the files are tested on a cheap stock Anet A8 printer and are designed to be fully support-less for ultimate ease of printing 
Throughout the campaign I will continue to create more tiles and tile variants to expand upon the possibilities of the space-lock system as well as creating more interesting scatter. 
As this is my first project I am keeping the project goal low with the aim of developing an ever expanding range of 3D printable products. All funding raised will go towards the development of new models as well as test printing any prototypes prior to release. During the funding period  I will continue to create and test print new tiles and scatter which will all be included as free extras for all supporters, I will also take any requests you have into consideration so that we can work together to create better looking games that people really do want to play.
 

What We Need & What You Get
Space-lock tiles are a system of interlocking modular tiles that dont require any small clips or fragile connectors to stay locked in place. The system supports multi level buildings and can be used to create solid tables without any voids or as a series of winding tunnels and rooms for all manner of modern and science fiction games. The tiles feature an integrated 1 inch square sytem without impacting the quality of the design and have been made to work equally well with both 28mm and 32mm scale miniatures although they can be scaled up or down as desired (I bet they look great printed on a photon at 25% scale now i think about it). So far all of the listed tiles and scatter terrain have been finished guarateeing each supporter will receive a great selection of files for creating truly epic scenery.  
To keep things simple there will be only 3 perks consisting of a early bird personal use perk, a standard personal use perk and a commercial use perk which will allow people to sell their prints for a one off licence fee for as long as they wish which will be ideal for startup printing businesses and larger print companies alike. All 3 perks will include everything that is currently finished plus any new models that are made during the campaign ensuring you get the best possible deal.

Below are some pictures of the finished pieces as well as a list of everything currently available.
Current tiles consist of:

Balcony corner A
Balcony corner B (inverted)
Balcony straight 
Balcony corner adapter
Balcony floor tile surround (U shape piece)
Ramp straight piece 
Ramp corner piece
Floor with corner post on 1 corner
Floor with corner post on 2 adjacent corners
Floor with corner post on 2 diagonal corners
Floor with corner post on 3 corners
Floor with corner post on 4 corner (crossroad tile)
Wall with corner post left
Wall with corner post right
Wall with 2 corner posts (T-junction)
Corridor corner
Corridor straight 
Corridor with door/ airlock
Room corner
Room wall
Room wall with door
Dead end 
Dead end with ladders
Floor A
Floor B
Floor C
Floor D
Steps tile
Door insert 

Current scatter terrain consist of:

Barrel A
Barrel B
Corner console A
Double console A
Double console B
Single console A
Stacked console A
Cryopod horizontal A
Cryopod standing B
Large desk
Med bay table
Portal
Riot shield large
Riot shield small
Satellite receiver large 
Satellite receiver small
Storage/ shipping container (Hex)
Table A
Table B

The following pictures are of the finished tiles and scatter as well as renders of various pieces I have yet to print. All of the tiles are printed with a 0.3 layer height using a 0.4 nozzle on a stock anet A8, all scatter is printed on the same machine using a 0.2 layer height. All of the models have been designed to be printed without supports although the 2 doors and portal has some sagging at the very top of the opening if bridging isn't turned on in the slicer. GW models are included for scale.
One thing to note is that all of the tiles are in their clean and undamaged states although I am currently working on some damaged and alien versions to add more variety which I hope to include in this campaign. 
 




 
I will continue to update this section with more pictures of the finished prints throughout the funding period as well as an in depth look at each tile and piece of scatter terrain. 
 
Licence Options
 
Space lock terrain will be available with two different licences covering both personal and commercial use.
The personal use licence is ideal if you want to print the files for your own use. This means the files or finished prints can not be profited from in any way including but not limited to selling painted or raw prints, printing the files as part of a service or editing the files or prints in any way.
The commercial licence is aimed at people that wish to sell their epic printed terrain. This does not allow you to profit from or distribute the files, either original or edited versions including modified ""remixed"" versions without prior written permission from myself. With this licence you can print and sell any of the tiles or scatter terrain released during this campaign (including any models released as part of the campaign which are completed after the funding date). The cost of the licence during this campaign is exclusive to this campaign and is a single fee granting you lifetime rights to profit from the printing of all files presented in this campaign. 
 
If you have any questions regarding the licences please contact me and I will be happy to help.

<p>Alternative Facts is fun Ad-Lib Debate Game, a mixture of Who's Line is it Anyway and real world political debates!</p>
<p>In Alternative Facts: The Game you have to convince your friends that you can solve real world problems with purely idiotic suggestions.</p>
<p>You play a grossly under-qualified Spokesperson to the White House who's been summoned to a press briefing to answer some questions from the media.</p>
<p>You're scared and you have no idea what you're supposed to say but WHAT'S THIS? The Commander in Chief has just handed you his personal notes on the issue just as you're facing the media...<br/><br/>Lie, deflect and debate or face getting fired!</p>
<p>110 Cards. Aprox 1 hour playtime. 3+ Players.</p>

<h3>Main Phase:</h3>

<p>At the end of each round all Players (The Media) must discuss and vote together on what was the least convincing argument.</p>
<p>The loser of that round then gets the Newsflash Card, 2 Newsflash Cards and a player is fired (When playing with 6+ Players only 1 Newsflash is enough to get a player fired).</p>

</div></div>","Alternative Facts is fun Ad-Lib Debate Game, a mixture of Who's Line is it Anyway and real world political debates!
In Alternative Facts: The Game you have to convince your friends that you can solve real world problems with purely idiotic suggestions.
You play a grossly under-qualified Spokesperson to the White House who's been summoned to a press briefing to answer some questions from the media.
You're scared and you have no idea what you're supposed to say but WHAT'S THIS? The Commander in Chief has just handed you his personal notes on the issue just as you're facing the media...Lie, deflect and debate or face getting fired!
110 Cards. Aprox 1 hour playtime. 3+ Players.

Main Phase:
At the beginning of each round you draw a Newsflash card and place it on the center of the table, starting with the player least qualified to work in government and going clockwise you each take turns as the White House Press Secretary blindly drawing an Alternative Fact card from the deck.
They must pitch to the other players (the media) using the notes they’ve drawn on their Alternative Facts Card by whatever means they can to support their argument.

At the end of each round all Players (The Media) must discuss and vote together on what was the least convincing argument.
The loser of that round then gets the Newsflash Card, 2 Newsflash Cards and a player is fired (When playing with 6+ Players only 1 Newsflash is enough to get a player fired).
Fired Players now cannot win but still get votes in the upcoming rounds as the media.This continues until there are 2 players left and it moves to the End Phase of the game.. End Phase (2 Players left):
Once it’s down to two players it enters the Political Debate phase of the game.A Newsflash Card is placed in between the final players, the Media now takes turns allocating new Alternative Fact Cards, switching between players changing the direction of their argument as dictated by the Alternative Fact Cards placed in front of them.The Media must change the Newsflash card, moving onto a new topic at their discretion as long as both players have had the chance to answer the Newsflash at least once.First player to laugh loses.
Winner should send their resume to the White House as you’re a damn good Liar!


Why did we feel the need to make this game?
In the current political climate where lying to the media using ""Alternative Facts"" and the active repression of science, logic, reason and compassion is the norm we felt this game helps demonstrate the absurdity of the situation.Hopefully this game can be used to highlight the important role that the media plays in politics and reflects the problems of a government that's grossly under-qualified to lead.
To make this game happen we need to raise enough to pay for the minimum print run and actually get the game into your hands. This is the majority of what the funding will go towards, getting that first run out!
We also need to pay artists and designers to get the game looking nice and pretty!
But the job doesn't end there! Getting the game out there and in front of people takes time and money, we plan on taking this game around to conventions so people can learn about how ridiculous Alternative Facts actually is and help to bring that political discussion into a space that's usually void of Politics.
10% percent of any profits made after costs from this Crowdfund will be donated towards the ACLU and NILC.

There's other ways for you to help promote ACTUAL facts rather than Fake ones, ways you can do this include donating directly to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)For almost 100 years, the ACLU has worked to defend and preserve the individual rights and liberties guaranteed by the Constitution and laws of the United States.

Other than the game itself we're also offering people the chance to put themselves in the final version of the game!
Pledge at the ""Become the News"" level to submit your OWN Newsflash Card to be used in the final copy of the game with your name also displayed on the card.
Newsflash Cards must be 30 words or less and respectful.Newsflash card submissions will be discussed and finalized after the campaign has finished.

(What's your favorite d-Bag fabric? Feel free to let us know in the Comments section!</p><p>Here's some back story:  In the process of fulfilling the 300+ original d-Bag rewards, I set up a relationship with a local Micro-Mass Manufacturer (MMM). This means that as I grow d-Bags will be made 100% in Oakland, CA or Pittsburgh, PA.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, I'll still be making some more unique d-Bags myself, but working with the MMM and the tools that they have access to means that I can start making them at a scale that I could never achieve personally.</p><p>In case you haven't noticed, it's about to be Christmas. So, my question for you is, who wants a d-Bag???<br/><br/>Here's some feedback from the first Kickstarter:</p><p>""My bag arrived today! It's gorgeous and works beautifully! I will no longer confuse my tea-box with my dice box. Nor will I ever not have enough dice at a game. :D"" - ketherian<br/><br/>""Got my bag today. Love it! Even better than I was expecting - so glad I backed this on an impulse."" - Nicola McBlane</p><p>""Received my bag and it is better than I expected. Please keep us posted on future store and sales as I will be considering these for future gifts-some for others, some for me :)"" - SM Moore<br/><br/>""It is gorgeous! So happy with this! It holds a crap ton of dice too! Each side pocket easily holds 12x 16mm d6s (could likely hold 18 or 20) or 36x 12mm d6s. The main compartment will hold an additional 80+ 12mm d6s, and when closed it feels about 80% full and dice stay in their pockets. Amazeballs! Super happy backer here!"" - Danny R<br/><br/>""I just received my bags today. Holy quality batman. These things are gorgeous. Thank you so much, I will cherish these."" - Steven Burge<br/><br/>""I got my bag yesterday and it's SOOOOOOO awesome. I can't wait to show it off on D&amp;D night!"" - phoenixphire24</p><p>""Got my dice bag last week and I'm loving it!"" - Elizabeth Horsebane</p><p>""Bag arrived today and it looks awesome, a majority of my dice fit inside."" - Daisy Ramirez</p><p>Are you an original backer of the d-Bag? Have people envied it? Have they wondered how they could buy their own?<br/><br/>Are you a local game store owner that might want to carry the d-Bags? Stores that carry my d-Bags order more! I just fulfilled a 30 bag order from ONE of our local game stores.</p><p>But here is the thing, distributors, they want at least 60% off the retail price, and I need to pay them storage fees and I still need to do all the marketing. Even if I sell direct to stores they want at least 50% off. In order to do that, I need to increase the scale that I'm making the d-Bags, and that's where this project comes in!</p><p>If a store wants to stock some of my mass produced d-Bags, send them my way!</p><p>I'm really hoping that you'll help me make this a reality!</p><p>PS- Because Kickstarter is now including postage in ""funds raised"" and because of the expense of international postage, I'm not including international shipping as an option here. If you want d-Bags shipped internationally, please contact me at:  thenewdbag@gmail.com</p><p>Risks and challenges</p><p>Since I'm not asking for the full amount to cover the project there might be a chance, I can't pay for the 500 bag break point. If that is the case, I will pay the higher price per bag and just make the number ordered.</p><p>What about the turnaround time? Having worked and been talking with my MMM I know that they can turnaround 100 bags per week, without a problem, and they say they can do all 500 in 2. but I have 5 weeks built in just in case.</p><p>How do you know they will sell in stores?

Most prefer bags, although some like the sort-ability provided by plastic...What if there was a bag that could sort?... well, there is! You can sort dice by set or by types, or whatever you want! No more fumbling for 6d6 or 5d4... just reach into the pocket and grab some!Plus, when it's open, there's a rolling surface in the middle. The d-Bag on top of the project is the prototype I made for my husband for Valentine's Day. Here's what the Black Pleather that I intend to mass produce would look like:The d-Bag solves three common problems faced by gamers:     How do you transport your dice?     How do you organize your dice? AND...     How do you contain your dice rolls?Want to see our product in action? Her's an interview of me at Kublacon in 2016... our first Convention appearance!Now, through this Project, you too can get a d-Bag at a steep Retail Discount, but that means that all orders will be fulfilled in Black Pleather (Henry Ford would be proud). If you want a fancy d-Bag imediately, those are still available at full price at www.getadbag.com (or you can get one by purchasing it here, again, with you're discount!). If we reach full funding, we'll add another type of bag. ALL BACKERS WILL BE ABLE TO CHOOSE FROM ALL BAGS AVAILABLE AT THE END OF THE PROJECT.$0-$3,000 - Black Pleather$3,000-$6,000 - Green Paisley Stripe (see fabric shot at bottom of page)$6,000-$9,000 - d's in SPaaaaCE (see fabric shot at bottom of page) $9,000-$12,000 - ???? (What's your favorite d-Bag fabric? Feel free to let us know in the Comments section!Here's some back story:  In the process of fulfilling the 300+ original d-Bag rewards, I set up a relationship with a local Micro-Mass Manufacturer (MMM). This means that as I grow d-Bags will be made 100% in Oakland, CA or Pittsburgh, PA.Don't get me wrong, I'll still be making some more unique d-Bags myself, but working with the MMM and the tools that they have access to means that I can start making them at a scale that I could never achieve personally.In case you haven't noticed, it's about to be Christmas. So, my question for you is, who wants a d-Bag???Here's some feedback from the first Kickstarter:""My bag arrived today! It's gorgeous and works beautifully! I will no longer confuse my tea-box with my dice box. Nor will I ever not have enough dice at a game. :D"" - ketherian""Got my bag today. Love it! Even better than I was expecting - so glad I backed this on an impulse."" - Nicola McBlane""Received my bag and it is better than I expected. Please keep us posted on future store and sales as I will be considering these for future gifts-some for others, some for me :)"" - SM Moore""It is gorgeous! So happy with this! It holds a crap ton of dice too! Each side pocket easily holds 12x 16mm d6s (could likely hold 18 or 20) or 36x 12mm d6s. The main compartment will hold an additional 80+ 12mm d6s, and when closed it feels about 80% full and dice stay in their pockets. Amazeballs! Super happy backer here!"" - Danny R""I just received my bags today. Holy quality batman. These things are gorgeous. Thank you so much, I will cherish these."" - Steven Burge""I got my bag yesterday and it's SOOOOOOO awesome. I can't wait to show it off on D&D night!"" - phoenixphire24""Got my dice bag last week and I'm loving it!"" - Elizabeth Horsebane""Bag arrived today and it looks awesome, a majority of my dice fit inside."" - Daisy RamirezAre you an original backer of the d-Bag? Have people envied it? Have they wondered how they could buy their own?Are you a local game store owner that might want to carry the d-Bags? Stores that carry my d-Bags order more! I just fulfilled a 30 bag order from ONE of our local game stores.But here is the thing, distributors, they want at least 60% off the retail price, and I need to pay them storage fees and I still need to do all the marketing. Even if I sell direct to stores they want at least 50% off. In order to do that, I need to increase the scale that I'm making the d-Bags, and that's where this project comes in!If a store wants to stock some of my mass produced d-Bags, send them my way!I'm really hoping that you'll help me make this a reality!PS- Because Kickstarter is now including postage in ""funds raised"" and because of the expense of international postage, I'm not including international shipping as an option here. If you want d-Bags shipped internationally, please contact me at:  thenewdbag@gmail.comRisks and challengesSince I'm not asking for the full amount to cover the project there might be a chance, I can't pay for the 500 bag break point. If that is the case, I will pay the higher price per bag and just make the number ordered.What about the turnaround time? Having worked and been talking with my MMM I know that they can turnaround 100 bags per week, without a problem, and they say they can do all 500 in 2. but I have 5 weeks built in just in case.How do you know they will sell in stores? I've started working with my local retail stores, and they have all sold the bags successfully. As I'm writing this, one store just ordered 50!I've also sold directly to consumers at conventions. I generally sell one d-Bag for every 10 people who attend the convention!What if the Fabric store doesn't get the fabric? This is unlikely to happen, as I have been in talks with them and on my world they will order and hold the fabric for me.

<p>Prior to launching GMC Games, my business partner and I diligently worked on the concept and design of the release of GMC Games, flagship board game GameDay Football®.

<p>Fall and football can be overwhelming for people that don't fully grasp gridiron football yet find themselves at a multitude of football events and parties. Our friends and family took-part in some friendly competitive mock play and found themselves totally engaged in game play.  Being able to play GameDay Football® board game with and among football fans brings back classic face to face interaction- something we don't see as often with the advent of solitary electronic video games. </p>
<p>Join us now, right at the very start of this magical journey and help us reach the End Zone! Your contribution will help us upgrade game pieces and create new and challenging plays on and off the football field. </p>

<p>Gameday Football® “The ultimate football ownership game” (GDF) tailored after American Football, combines the fun and fanfare that governs the sport. Gamers become the player, own multiple teams, build multiple stadiums and celebrate like the ultimate fan. In playing GDF a player will experience the nuances that come with the game, flags will be thrown, violations will be given, endorsements will be earned, and rules will be pushed to the limits by your opponent’s eager, to get your player ejected and sent to the locker room. </p>
<p>While playing GameDay Football® you get to experience first-hand what it’s like to own a team and play on the gridiron. Gamers roll the dice, acquire a state and let the games begin! Each owner that buys a state can, erect a field, buy and develop a stadium and increase the stadiums value by adding on concessions, parking, luxury boxes, and 5-star restaurants all in the form of individual flags. </p>
<p>GameDay Football® becomes even more exciting when a gamer gets a player on the field. This game of strategy has no alliances- the winning goal is to score 21 points via touchdowns and have the most revenue. With each roll of the dice, GDF is filled with many twists and turns that could either elevate your game or leave you in turmoil. Whether it’s landing on the spinning wheel, picking up the money from the league fines and penalty fee’s when landing on the tailgate box, or facing the fate of the draw when pulling from one of the four game cards placed around the board. Another benefit while playing GameDay Football® is that when a player rolls the dice and it lands on two “G’s” representing the GameDay Football® logo, the player advances around the field to the start and gets to roll the red GDF bonus dice. Depending on what the player rolls, that player will get that value plus $1000 dollars.</p>
<p>GameDay Football® gameplay will raise your football IQ, bring out your competitive nature and give you the thrill of victory.</p>
<p>Game designed for 2 to 5 players ages 13 and over.  </p>

<h2>Short Summary</h2>
<p>Hello I’m Felix Joy and I’m proud to present my first solo playing cards - The Split. This Deck is an encapsulated form of minimal, typographic and graphic design styles.</p>
<p>The designing has been done through testing and tweaking to find the best style.</p>
<p>A single typeface and minimal design ensures cards areas to read and gives a unique twist to traditional style.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1500990915/qnf2sqmwwjgzdqo2kvwp.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;"">** Card Colors may differ slightly because of different light settings**</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>The Split Deck truly represents its name with a split design as you can see in the card. I wanted the design to be minimal and restrictive, so complex patterns have not been included in this series, but a bold and simple approach have instead been introduced.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1501277382/gygsd1wqnpzywsonuofi.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Hello I’m Felix Joy and I’m proud to present my first solo playing cards - The Split. This Deck is an encapsulated form of minimal, typographic and graphic design styles.
The designing has been done through testing and tweaking to find the best style.
A single typeface and minimal design ensures cards areas to read and gives a unique twist to traditional style.

 
** Card Colors may differ slightly because of different light settings**
 
Design
The Split Deck truly represents its name with a split design as you can see in the card. I wanted the design to be minimal and restrictive, so complex patterns have not been included in this series, but a bold and simple approach have instead been introduced.


I have created a test deck and printed to ensure meticulous testing of how the card plays, holds, the way your eyes are drawn to each element and the hierarchy of each.
As not only a designer, but also a playing card fan, I wanted to create a series of playing card decks that stands out from the others in my collection, and share with you all a new experience of card playing.
Using a modern approach to design, the goal was to develop a look that is totally new and fresh. The Split Playing Cards are luxury for the modern cardician.

Colors 
I have used the standard playing colors, i.e., Red and Black for this edition as it is the most basic colours for playing cards. In future I will be introducing more vibrant and playful colours to the collection.


Faces
The faces, inspired by typographic and minimalisitc approach, look completely clean but with same split branding which is black and red splits respectively.



Quality & Handling
After we established the look, we focused on the feel. The true mark of a card is how it handles. The Split Deck will be printed by the United States Playing Card Company on the highest quality card stock available. The deck will be with the legendary Air Cushion Finish to provide for the smoothest spread, fans, and shuffles. 


Pricing

We started to describe it. The task wasn’t easy at all. Some places in the story have been rewritten twice or even three times. For the finalization of our work we asked Matt to help us. As a native English speaker Matt made a real impact to our story from the literature point of view (thanks Matt! ) </p><h3>
<br/>Production</h3><p>From the very beginning I was trying to make the game nice looking and easy to play. It’s not very convenient to store the game in a big box, so we placed everything into an A5 format box. I was surprised by the fact that professional typography is an absolutely unknown world for me. Luckily my wife’s brother Roman helped me with the preparation of all the materials for print (thanks Roman, without you there were no chances that this project would get on paper).<br/>Facing all the problems I realized that it’s impossible to put all the ideas I have in just one game. I wish I could make a second part of the game and continue the story, adding more interesting characters and unexpected plot pivots. <br/>My task is to make the game alive and to let it be loved by players all over the world. </p><h3>Overview</h3><p>The game Long trip adventure “Escape from Orodor” is the first of a series games based on Throw and go system. Together with your characters you have to go a long way full of adventures and dangers. It is not an easy goal to reach the end. To survive, you will need to look for supplies and fight with creatures that inhabit this dangerous world. LTA games are perfectly compatible with each other and allow you to combine sets, creating unique combinations of heroes, artifacts, creatures and fantasy worlds. The game has no age restrictions.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554726079/v3biti8fxz2np4jetimv.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3><strong>Game Details</strong></h3><p> </p><h3>Heroes</h3><p>LTA game is a role-playing game. The player will have to play the role of some hero or a group of heroes. Each character is depicted on a character card. It has the character’s name, the amount of his/her Strength, Agility (his/her Protection), Accuracy and Health bar. On the same card there are fields of hunger and, cell of fatigue and the cell of poisoning. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554726328/wrazu10lcapgpv5pb8f6.png"" src=""""/></p><h3>Movement on the global map and time measurement</h3><p>Any journey begins with the first step. First, drop a d6 dice and mark on the map how far your heroes have advanced. The campaign has begun.</p><p>Note that the global map is divided into segments (from one digit to another). It will be described later. The way is unpredictable. Maybe the weather is good and sunny or maybe the heroes have got into a storm. One and the same road can take different amount of time.</p><p>In order to find out how much time the move took for your heroes, roll d6 and mark on the timeline how many hours it took to pass this segment of the path. It’s up to the player to decide when the journey should be started (where will be the mark on a timeline).</p><h3>The Book of the Day and the Book of the Night</h3><p>When you marked on the timeline table how much time you havespent to pass your way on the map, you will find out what time it is now. Daytime lasts from 4 to 20 (let’s just call it “day”). From 20 to 4 it is the nighttime (let’s just call it “night”). During daytime you can easily hunt and find berries without fear of meeting dangerous creatures. But a beautiful light and safe forest looks quite different at night. Night is a dangerous time to walk through theswamp, because you can’t see the path. At night, you should not wander around the cemeteries and disturb the dead. The Book ofthe Day and the Book of the Night will tell you where your heroesare and what is happening to them. Look at the segment of thepath your heroes are. Open the Book of the Day (if it is the day at the moment) or the Book of the Night (if it is night) on the paragraph that relates to the segment of the path on which your heroes are located. Here you can find a description of the area and specialrules applicable to this area.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554726638/ld74vmozhvsbmqjy7mqz.png"" src=""""/></p><h3>Decks of cards</h3><p>In the game, there are 2 basic decks of cards (Day and Night) withcards of creatures that heroes can meet and events that can occur with the characters on their path. There is also a deck of items consisting of various things that heroes can find. In The Book of the Day and the Book of the Night you will often find an instructionto take a card from the corresponding deck. The absence of such instruction means that the terrain is more or less safe. But sometimes heroes decide to search the current terrain, for example, to find something valuable (food, supplies, treasures or artifacts). If you want to perform a research in this area, take the corresponding Day or Night card. In one turn, you can search the terrain only once.</p><h3>The Deck of the Day and the Deck of the Night</h3><p>In the daytime the player is relatively safe. The chance to meet a dangerous creature is much lower than at night. In the daytime it’s easier to find supplies or to hunt. In the daytime, you will often meet neutral creatures with which you can interact. At night everything changes. Creatures that get out of their shelters are more dangerous at night. You can’t find supplies at night and rarely meet peaceful creatures. Consider this when you decide to travel at night.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1554726922/fsehxeduy3lbd0m0j4e4.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>The Deck of items</h3><p>You will find a lot of items during your adventures. Sometimes you will find new items defeating your enemies, sometimes you will find something by searching the area.</p><p>When you need to check what kind of item you’ve just found take a card from the Deck of items. Items that you found can be stacked next to you to use them later. You will find the description of theitems in the cards, but we’ve tried to make it obvious.</p><p>For example, potions allow you to restore a health or strength amount, armor increases protection, and weapons increase the chance to inflict damage to the enemy.</p><p>• Potions are disposable cards that a player can use any time (even in combat). After using the card, you must return the items back into the deck and shuffle it.</p><p>• Shield is a card that allows the player to gainadditional protection against enemy attacks. After each successful attack of the enemy, roll the D20 and compare its value with the value.</p><p>on the shield card. If the score on the dice is less than or equal to the value in the card, you have successfully repelled the attack with the shield. Shield is a reusable card, however it can’t be used with a two-handed weapon.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1556106777/f99csdwtulzekn2o4o9w.jpg"" src=""""/></p><h3>The Enemies</h3><p>Sometimes your heroes meet enemies on their way. Cowardly goblins, fearless undead or giant trolls - they all pose a danger to the heroes. In the Deck of the Day or Deck of the Night you can find creature cards. Creature cards show what kind of creature you have met, its strength, defense, accuracy (if the creature has a ranged attack), the health bar and special rules applicable to<br/>these creatures. Also there is the “bag” icon on the card, which shows how many items you can loot from the creature, if you defeat it (if you defeated several creatures, you take as many items as the creatures you defeated accordingly).</p><h3><strong>How to Play</strong></h3><div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q4nDtKInNH0?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div><p> </p><p style=""text-align: center;""><strong>We really need your support to bring this game to life in a way that we couldn't without your help.<br/>Thank You for taking the time to read through this and we hope you enjoy this game.</strong></p></div>","-What are we going do tonight? - Create a tabletop game, buddy. My cousin is 5 years older than me.

ProductionFrom the very beginning I was trying to make the game nice looking and easy to play. It’s not very convenient to store the game in a big box, so we placed everything into an A5 format box. I was surprised by the fact that professional typography is an absolutely unknown world for me. Luckily my wife’s brother Roman helped me with the preparation of all the materials for print (thanks Roman, without you there were no chances that this project would get on paper).Facing all the problems I realized that it’s impossible to put all the ideas I have in just one game. I wish I could make a second part of the game and continue the story, adding more interesting characters and unexpected plot pivots. My task is to make the game alive and to let it be loved by players all over the world. OverviewThe game Long trip adventure “Escape from Orodor” is the first of a series games based on Throw and go system. Together with your characters you have to go a long way full of adventures and dangers. It is not an easy goal to reach the end. To survive, you will need to look for supplies and fight with creatures that inhabit this dangerous world. LTA games are perfectly compatible with each other and allow you to combine sets, creating unique combinations of heroes, artifacts, creatures and fantasy worlds. The game has no age restrictions.Game Details HeroesLTA game is a role-playing game. The player will have to play the role of some hero or a group of heroes. Each character is depicted on a character card. It has the character’s name, the amount of his/her Strength, Agility (his/her Protection), Accuracy and Health bar. On the same card there are fields of hunger and, cell of fatigue and the cell of poisoning. Movement on the global map and time measurementAny journey begins with the first step. First, drop a d6 dice and mark on the map how far your heroes have advanced. The campaign has begun.Note that the global map is divided into segments (from one digit to another). It will be described later. The way is unpredictable. Maybe the weather is good and sunny or maybe the heroes have got into a storm. One and the same road can take different amount of time.In order to find out how much time the move took for your heroes, roll d6 and mark on the timeline how many hours it took to pass this segment of the path. It’s up to the player to decide when the journey should be started (where will be the mark on a timeline).The Book of the Day and the Book of the NightWhen you marked on the timeline table how much time you havespent to pass your way on the map, you will find out what time it is now. Daytime lasts from 4 to 20 (let’s just call it “day”). From 20 to 4 it is the nighttime (let’s just call it “night”). During daytime you can easily hunt and find berries without fear of meeting dangerous creatures. But a beautiful light and safe forest looks quite different at night. Night is a dangerous time to walk through theswamp, because you can’t see the path. At night, you should not wander around the cemeteries and disturb the dead. The Book ofthe Day and the Book of the Night will tell you where your heroesare and what is happening to them. Look at the segment of thepath your heroes are. Open the Book of the Day (if it is the day at the moment) or the Book of the Night (if it is night) on the paragraph that relates to the segment of the path on which your heroes are located. Here you can find a description of the area and specialrules applicable to this area.Decks of cardsIn the game, there are 2 basic decks of cards (Day and Night) withcards of creatures that heroes can meet and events that can occur with the characters on their path. There is also a deck of items consisting of various things that heroes can find. In The Book of the Day and the Book of the Night you will often find an instructionto take a card from the corresponding deck. The absence of such instruction means that the terrain is more or less safe. But sometimes heroes decide to search the current terrain, for example, to find something valuable (food, supplies, treasures or artifacts). If you want to perform a research in this area, take the corresponding Day or Night card. In one turn, you can search the terrain only once.The Deck of the Day and the Deck of the NightIn the daytime the player is relatively safe. The chance to meet a dangerous creature is much lower than at night. In the daytime it’s easier to find supplies or to hunt. In the daytime, you will often meet neutral creatures with which you can interact. At night everything changes. Creatures that get out of their shelters are more dangerous at night. You can’t find supplies at night and rarely meet peaceful creatures. Consider this when you decide to travel at night.The Deck of itemsYou will find a lot of items during your adventures. Sometimes you will find new items defeating your enemies, sometimes you will find something by searching the area.When you need to check what kind of item you’ve just found take a card from the Deck of items. Items that you found can be stacked next to you to use them later. You will find the description of theitems in the cards, but we’ve tried to make it obvious.For example, potions allow you to restore a health or strength amount, armor increases protection, and weapons increase the chance to inflict damage to the enemy.• Potions are disposable cards that a player can use any time (even in combat). After using the card, you must return the items back into the deck and shuffle it.• Shield is a card that allows the player to gainadditional protection against enemy attacks. After each successful attack of the enemy, roll the D20 and compare its value with the value.on the shield card. If the score on the dice is less than or equal to the value in the card, you have successfully repelled the attack with the shield. Shield is a reusable card, however it can’t be used with a two-handed weapon.The EnemiesSometimes your heroes meet enemies on their way. Cowardly goblins, fearless undead or giant trolls - they all pose a danger to the heroes. In the Deck of the Day or Deck of the Night you can find creature cards. Creature cards show what kind of creature you have met, its strength, defense, accuracy (if the creature has a ranged attack), the health bar and special rules applicable tothese creatures. Also there is the “bag” icon on the card, which shows how many items you can loot from the creature, if you defeat it (if you defeated several creatures, you take as many items as the creatures you defeated accordingly).How to Play We really need your support to bring this game to life in a way that we couldn't without your help.Thank You for taking the time to read through this and we hope you enjoy this game.",7.0,1,"1 Campaign

<p>Divination has followed humankind throughout  our existence.  The ancient Celts had Ogham.  The Norse used Runes.  Even older still the Greeks, Chinese, and other cultures practiced osteomancy or Reading the Bones.  There are many ways the human race has sought explanation or to tap into a divine intuition and higher consciousness.  A querent may gain insight into a situation or question by a standardized ritual with a deck of specialized playing cards called Tarot cards.  This unique deck of cards typically is made up of 78 cards which are divided into two sections.  The trump cards number twenty two in count but start with the number zero or the Fool card.  These twenty two cards are called the the Major Arcana.  The other section of fifty six cards make up the the Minor Arcana.  These cards would also represent a standardized deck of playing cards used in present times for games like Bridge or Poker.  This unique Tarot deck contains 21 additional cards called the Elder Arcana, including lesser known cards like the Chance, Primeval Forest,  Healer, and The Messenger cards.</p>

<p>Updates will be provided weekly and backers will be given exclusive images as the tarot deck is being completed.  This is a unique way for contributors to see ultimately the birth of this project in its entirety from the initial stages of ink and charcoal drawings to full color images.</p>

<p>At the beginning of time, nothing existed but for a strong life force. Over millennia, this force gradually accumulated, intertwined and grew into an enormous, wondrous tree at the edge of the world. This tree called the ""Tree of Life"", then created soil, stone, and water from which every living being in this world was born.</p>
<p>As time passed, these living beings evolved, expanded and created their own societies of which the major races are the Humans, Elves, Angels Demons, and Werebeasts. The Tree of Life saw all these struggling young races and chose to provide them with the absolute power over this world, the power of ""Neokami"" with which you can create, destroy and manipulate all living beings. But the Tree of Life loved all races equally and wanted them to compete fair and square, so every 1,000 years a fighting competition is held. There, Champions from each race collects ""Blessings of Life"" to use as a key to get the ""Neo-seed"", the source of godly power and with it plant a new powerful tree that will become the ""Neokami"".</p>

<h2><b>                           </b></h2>
<h2><b>- The story -</b></h2>
<p> </p>
<p>My name is Ann Dolidze. I work as a psychotherapist.</p>
<p>I have many passions including reading, writing, traveling, social studies and animals. At the age of 25, I decided to challenge myself : create the books I have always dreamed of reading. For 5 years I did not stop writing, I kept a blog and wrote several books. <i>The soul of France speaks to you</i> is the first project that I decided to expose to the general public.</p>
<p>With <i>The Soul of France</i>, I set myself the goal to make you discover the French culture in such depths, that after reading the book you will know this culture in a way that only the French could know it until this day.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561537113/ebwg31fqmrz4tbyrgxzy.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p>In order to offer you the most incredible of experiences, I intended to bring up all the following elements:</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>The beauty</u></h3>
<p>Our inner child's soul is fond of cards. They are miniature paintings that we can take anywhere with us. The final cards will be printed in gold on the edges. The title “The Soul of France speaks to you” on the box and on the book will be golden too.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561537424/ielyjfeb2ycnr6cuphc4.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>The game</u></h3>
<p>The cards can be drawn alone, surrounded by our loved ones or with people we have just met. On a day off, on a bus or at a party. The draw is a surprise, which character would like to address us today?</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>The knowledge</u></h3>
<p>I have noticed that it’s not by reading massive books that one keeps more information in mind. It seems essential to me to offer historical knowledge in accordance with the reading habits related to our time: synthetic, fast and intense. My goal is to present you life summaries. Free to you, depending on your interests, to delve in the history of your favorite characters according to the media that you like the most.</p>

<h3><u>The Emotion</u></h3>
<p>Each figure has experienced something exceptional. Each figure embodies and symbolizes an aspect of life that we all have experienced in different forms and at different levels.</p>
<p>These modern poems could be song lyrics.</p>
<p>When we draw the cards together, we can also discuss the different notions: ""And you Laura, what does Power mean to you?"" ""Marc, would you like to reach a power as great as that of Napoleon?”</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>The wisdom</u></h3>
<p>Every day we wonder about ourselves. It is always good to congratulate ourselves on the beautiful aspects we are manifesting, and to remember that it is sage to take into consideration certain universal wisdoms for the good of all.</p>
<p>These are suggestions, free to us to welcome them or not, to take them seriously or not.</p>

<strong> </strong>- La grande question -</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Dans l’histoire de l’humanité, nous n’avons jamais autant voyagé qu’à notre époque. La plupart d’entre nous a visité plusieurs pays et fait la connaissance de personnes venant des quatre coins du monde. Nous avons accès à une multitude de renseignements sur différents pays et leur culture via internet.<br/>Et pourtant que savons-nous vraiment sur les 197 pays que comporte notre terre ? Que ce soit nos pays voisins ou ceux d’autres continents ? </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<h2> - Mon histoire -</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>Je m’appelle Ann Dolidzé. J’exerce le métier de psychothérapeute.</p>
<p>J’ai plusieurs passions, parmi elles : la lecture, l’écriture, les voyages, les sciences humaines et les animaux. A l’âge de 25 ans, j’ai décidé de me lancer un challenge fou : créer les livres que j’ai toujours rêvé avoir lu. Pendant 5 ans je n’ai pas cessé d’écrire, j’ai tenu un blog et rédigé plusieurs ouvrages. <i>L’âme de la France vous parle</i> est le premier projet que j’ai décidé d’exposer au grand publique.</p>
<p>Je me suis fixée comme défi avec <i>L’âme de la France</i>, de vous faire découvrir la culture française dans une profondeur telle, qu’à la fin de la lecture de ce livre, vous allez connaître cette culture comme seuls les français pouvaient la connaître jusqu’à ce jour.</p>

<p>Traduction de la 4ème de couverture:</p>
<p>A travers 40 cartes à messages magnifiquement illustrées, partez à la découverte des trésors que recèle ce pays. Un livre vous délivrera les secrets d’histoire de ses captivants personnages. Du nord au sud, de ouest en est les origines de ses traditions et de ses œuvres vous seront révélées. Chaque figure vous offre une poésie. Recevez la beauté de ces mots. Sentez votre cœur vibrer.

<p>Notre âme d’enfant affectionne les cartes. Ce sont des tableaux miniatures que nous pouvons emmener partout avec nous. Le contour des cartes ainsi que le titre <i>""L'âme de la France vous parle"" </i>sur le coffret et sur le livre seront imprimés en or.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3><u>Le jeu </u></h3>
<p>Nous pouvons tirer les cartes seul, entouré de nos proches ou de personnes dont on vient de faire la connaissance. Dans le calme, dans un bus ou dans une soirée. Le tirage est une surprise, quel personnage voudrait s’adresser à nous aujourd’hui ?</p>
<p> </p>
<h3><u>La connaissance </u></h3>
<p>J’ai remarqué que ce n’est pas parce que nous lisons de gros livres que nous gardons plus d’information en tête pour autant. Il me semble essentiel de vous offrir des connaissances historiques en accord avec les habitudes de lecture liées à notre temps : synthétique, rapide et intense. Mon objectif est de vous présenter des résumés de vies. Libre à vous, selon vos intérêts de creuser en profondeur l’histoire de vos personnages préférés selon les médias que vous affectionnez le plus.</p>

</div></div>","- The story -
 
My name is Ann Dolidze. I work as a psychotherapist.
I have many passions including reading, writing, traveling, social studies and animals. At the age of 25, I decided to challenge myself : create the books I have always dreamed of reading. For 5 years I did not stop writing, I kept a blog and wrote several books. The soul of France speaks to you is the first project that I decided to expose to the general public.
With The Soul of France, I set myself the goal to make you discover the French culture in such depths, that after reading the book you will know this culture in a way that only the French could know it until this day.
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In order to offer you the most incredible of experiences, I intended to bring up all the following elements:
 
The beauty
Our inner child's soul is fond of cards. They are miniature paintings that we can take anywhere with us. The final cards will be printed in gold on the edges. The title “The Soul of France speaks to you” on the box and on the book will be golden too.
 

 
The game
The cards can be drawn alone, surrounded by our loved ones or with people we have just met. On a day off, on a bus or at a party. The draw is a surprise, which character would like to address us today?
 
 
 
The knowledge
I have noticed that it’s not by reading massive books that one keeps more information in mind. It seems essential to me to offer historical knowledge in accordance with the reading habits related to our time: synthetic, fast and intense. My goal is to present you life summaries. Free to you, depending on your interests, to delve in the history of your favorite characters according to the media that you like the most.
 
       The List

The painted caves – The heritage
 French wine – L’ivresse
 Héloïse and Abélard  – The couple
 The angel shark – The threat
 100 years war – The conflits
 Jeanne d’Arc – The conviction
 Jean de la Fontaine – The morality
 Nostradamus – The futur
 Molière – The comedy
Jean-Jacques Rousseau – The confession
Denis Diderot – The knowledge
Philippe Pinel – The madness
Marie Antoinette – The superficiality
Storming of the Bastille – The revolt
Napoléon – The power
Grasse – The perfume
Louis Pasteur – The progress
Claude Monet – The landscape
Madame Bovary – The insatisfaction
Lumière brothers – The innovation
Claude de Bussy – The originality
Camille Claudel – The passion
Caroline Otéro – The irresistible
Gustave Doré – The perfectionism
Coco Chanel – The elegance
Victor Hugo – The involvement
Eiffel Tour – The greatness
Céleste Mogador - The scandal
Pétanque – The friendliness
Les poilus – The hardness
Jacques-Yves Cousteau – The exploration
Simone de Beauvoir – The equality
The little prince– The childhood    
Joséphine Baker – Crazy years
Jean moulin – The resistance
Robert Doisneau – The memories
Claude Lévi-Strauss – The differences
Abbey Pierre – The solidarity
Paul Bocuse – The gastronomy
The Mont Blanc – The purity

 
The 40 figures in this list are introduced in chronological order. Beside their name, discover the title of the poem that accompanies them. You do not know most of the figures? It's perfect! I'm glad you will learn a lot!
 

 
 
The Emotion
Each figure has experienced something exceptional. Each figure embodies and symbolizes an aspect of life that we all have experienced in different forms and at different levels.
These modern poems could be song lyrics.
When we draw the cards together, we can also discuss the different notions: ""And you Laura, what does Power mean to you?"" ""Marc, would you like to reach a power as great as that of Napoleon?”
 
The wisdom
Every day we wonder about ourselves. It is always good to congratulate ourselves on the beautiful aspects we are manifesting, and to remember that it is sage to take into consideration certain universal wisdoms for the good of all.
These are suggestions, free to us to welcome them or not, to take them seriously or not.
 
 
Who is the box for?
 

 

All the travel, history and poetry lovers.
All the France lovers.
Anyone who would like to visit or already has visited France.
All those who would like to offer a sublime souvenir of France.
The French expatriates who would like to share the culture of their own country.
The grown-up children of the French diaspora who would appreciate this tool of    transmission.
Anyone interested on personal development.
Anyone whose favorite movie category is: biopics.
Anyone interested on having an original experience.

 
The box will be available in both French and English versions.

<p>Don't be fooled by the simplicity of such a task because there are 8 different cryptocurrencies to play and 4 auction types for each cryptocurrency. At the start of Crypto, each player is dealt a set amount of cards depending on the number of players in the game. Each card represents a certain cryptocurrency and its individual auction type. For example, the first player may play a Bitcoin Vickrey Auction where every player secretly selects the amount they are willing to pay and reveals it at once. Whoever reveals the highest price pays an amount equal to the second highest bidder. </p>
<p>The three other auction types are:</p>
<p>The English Auction: The price starts at $0 and rises until someone accepts a price first.</p>
<p>The Dutch Auction: The price starts at an above average price set by the auctioneer and decreases until someone accepts a price first.</p>
<p>The Fixed Price Auction: The auctioneer sets a fixed price on the cryptocurrency and then it is auctioned in clockwise order.</p>
<p>Beware though, because every coin must be bought when it is auctioned. If you set a fixed price auction too high, you'll be the one paying for it.</p>
<p>A round ends when the fifth card of a certain cryptocurrency is played. The most played cryptocurrency gets an added valuation of $30 million (gold coin), the second most played gets an added valuation of $20 million (silver coin), the third most played gets an added valuation of $10 million (bronze coin), and the rest get no added valuation. You can then choose to sell your own bought cryptocurrency to cash out now or hold on to them in hopes of greater future valuation.</p>

<p>Watch out, because as the game goes on, event cards become crucial. The four event card are Rumors, Hacks, Sell-offs, and Hard Forks, each with a unique effect on overall gameplay.</p>

<h3>The Inventor/Founder</h3>
<p>Hi! I'm Rob; Founder of Dynamic Dimenzions and inventor of GRIDLOCX and CLICK! I reside in Newport News, VA, and work as an IT Security Manager. I faithfully and honorably served 20 years in the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy. I retired from the Navy, as a highly-decorated Sailor, June 2001. During my last two tours, I discovered my creative talents in writing and inventing. To date, I've created three patents and 300+ innovative, mixed genre patent concepts and numerous mixed genres of novel concepts. I am presenting (2) board games for this crowdfunding to help expedite pushing them through the hurdles associated with upcoming full production runs.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1611261871/o90lndlpsthnjzegu2vb.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""> </p>
<h3>Above and beyond </h3>
<p> Your contribution enables the launch of the board games and supports the funding goal that reduces cost, to make it more affordable at the introductory inception. Most of all, your contributions will enable the creation of more products that will eventually help those affected by the pandemic should they sign up for the COVID Campaign which is aimed at helping those financially crashed by creating legitimate, small-scale businesses they can run from the comfort of their home.  </p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Not included; my new Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) “VIRA Shield 2000” (VS2000)/Patent pending #63,024,837; submitted to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on 05/14/2020. Plans are to launch the VS-2000 in January 2021.</p>
<h3>Goal</h3>
<p>My goal is to help 100k people become millionaires and another million generate a recurring income! More in-depth info  on my website: <a href=""http://www.STITCHUZ.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.STITCHUZ.com</a></p>
<h3><strong>Business Support</strong></h3>
<p> Dynamic Dimenzions (STITCHUZ parent) launches mid-December. Due to COVID, I am launching my contingency plan, which assists those unemployed in starting their own legitimate business. Your support alone, kickstarts the boardgames; which ignites a self-sustaining business platform and mega job creator! I've already launched a strong marketing campaign on STITCHUZ.com, under “COVID Campaign.”   As I push more new, innovative products to the market, I am able to share more cost savings to those affected by the pandemic and enable them to put food on the table, pay bills, and still have enough money to restock their next order. This is nothing more than simply sharing, by drastically lowering my profit margin others can profit as well in these trying times. </p>
<p>  Dynamic Dimenzions is a product creator that pushes recurring new products; starting with GRID-LOCX and CLICK! So, when you support this campaign, you are not just supporting a small project and founder but up to millions who can benefit from selling these and future products.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>  We need to raise $420,000USDs for GRID-LOCX and CLICK! GRID-LOCX and CLICK! are not your standard flat board games; they have expanded layer decking (with GRID-LOCX), and moving components (with CLICK!) increases costs to manufacture. Due to the manufacturer's loss of time and wages, when setting up a small production run; this production effort becomes more costly. The cost listed below is for both games and is based on a 9.6K production runs per game.</p>
<p><strong>NEW GRID-LOCX</strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1611260561/a6y1n6ja1yiwep0nece9.png"" src=""""/></p>

<p><strong>A taste of the high-level rules:</strong> First; decide on the play level (long or short). If you have a hot head in the game, they can opt to play the extended version while others play the short version. This alone adds more excitement, and you really don’t know how the game will end, but that’s the excitement! Next, in a round-robin fashion, each player rolls the regular dice. The person with the highest number goes first.  The game is driven by plucking from the deck, following the instruction on the cards, and advancing around the board. There’s also: ""PICK’em &amp; GO!"" And ""Hold-em!"" These are additional ways to play; in strategic or stealth mode, but not so fast; because as you advance, an opponent can land on your chip and put you in a holding pattern (onboard) until you draw a REGRID card that allows you to go back to the farthest start point.  This game demands your attention because if you are not alert you could easily lose!</p>
<p><u>There are 3 ways to win: </u>(1) Card or dice your way off the board, (2) Collect all of one player's move pieces and, (3) attaining seven Wild Cards</p>
<p><strong>Next, I’ll introduce you to the playing cards: </strong></p>

<p><strong>A taste of the high-level rules:</strong> First; decide on the play type (center or outbound). This adds more excitement, and you really don’t know how the game will end! Next, in a round-robin fashion, each player rolls the dice. The person with the highest number goes first. The game is driven by plucking from the deck, following the instruction on the cards, and advancing around the board but not so fast; because as you advance, the player can land on your move piece and block your move piece from advancing around the board. There are times when a skillful player may lock you in until the game is almost over, so you have to be skillful and tactful in placing your moving pieces and covering down on them as you advance around the board. The card or dice will determine how many clicks to the right; you spin the board to align your outer circle colors with the center colors. With Click! You also have the option of playing the game with the player holding cards to strategically plot to win, but not so fast because the middle platform is constantly spinning, so you have to have a very watchful eye as the clicks come and go! Like GRID-LOCX, the game is designed so that new players can join in at any time during the game.</p>

<p><i><strong>GRID-LOCX and CLICK! </strong></i>are amazing board games. They possess advanced designs and hold endless tactical and skillful possibilities that test the player's creativity and their strong desire to win! With both games, you can play for fun or become even more skillful when playing the games with cards in hand because it gives you an even more strategic advantage in plotting your way to victory! </p>
<h3><strong>Roughly, funds will be used in the following capacity: </strong></h3>
<p>$8,000.00/Mold</p>
<p>$288,000.00/Full production run 9.6K each boardgame (to include Packaging, Assembly, Final Prototyping)</p>

<p>$TBD/Crowd Fees</p>
<h3><strong>Sufficient Funding</strong></h3>
<p>With the right funding, we will push both GRID-LOCX and CLICK! to the forefront of tabletop gaming and make them household brands. Once on store-shelves, it is important to us that GRID-LOCX and CLICK! remains affordable and within reach for the majority of low to mid-level family budgets. The best way to achieve this is to use full-scale manufacturing to make the parts. However, the tooling necessary for full-scale manufacturing is a labor-intensive and costly process, requiring a huge upfront investment. Here is the best part... You can help get GRID-LOCX and CLICK! get through the hurdles of manufacturing and be one of the first to get your very own GRID-LOCX or/and CLICK! simply by contributing! Imagine your family members' faces when you come home with one of these games and surprise them!</p>
<h3>Perks</h3>
<p>Please take a look at some of the many cool rewards we have for my backers! I want my work in your hands and homes, so every pledge of $3 or more is all it takes! If you're compelled to contribute more, we've created some entertaining pledge experiences for your enjoyment. Our perks are copywritten, so outside of this campaign, you can only get them from our website.</p>
<h3>Overfunding<br/> </h3>
<p>Should we exceed our goal, we'll stretch our creativity toward more production runs to support our COVID Campaign and continue to lower costs for the COVID businesses we support during the pandemic, so we can sustain as a mega job creator! The products listed become a part of the product line and products that we share. Your contributions help us reach our goal of being able to brand GRID-LOCX"" and CLICK! and sustain others that are less fortunate.</p>
<p>  I am currently wrapping up a new novel ""The Mirror in the Mirror,"" a horror/inspirational and SCI-FI novel in which ""GRID-LOCX"" and CLICK! are played and part of the plot.</p>
<p>  Also, additional funds will be used to ensure that everyone who contributes $150+ receives an autographed soft copy of ""The Mirror in the Mirror"" and its printed cover on (1) postcard, (1) wallet-size card, and (1) bookmarker. </p>

<p>  Dynamic Dimenzions is a global enterprise launch so the success of these games ignites a global outreach. The success of this project will one day contribute to the economic growth of the U.S. on a major scale and globally on a smaller scale. As the inventor of GRID-LOCX, I am ecstatic about the issuance of the patent in October of 2020 as well as the pending patent for CLICK which should be released soon.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
</div><div><p>There is low to no risk for this project. The unforeseen risks are unpredictable taxes and unpredictable overseas shipping costs associated with bulk shipping.  With 25 plus years in the civil sector as a contractor and functioning in program and project management, I don't foresee any challenges that can't be easily and expeditiously mitigated with focus. </p></div><div>

</div></div>","The Inventor/Founder
Hi! I'm Rob; Founder of Dynamic Dimenzions and inventor of GRIDLOCX and CLICK! I reside in Newport News, VA, and work as an IT Security Manager. I faithfully and honorably served 20 years in the U.S. Army and U.S. Navy. I retired from the Navy, as a highly-decorated Sailor, June 2001. During my last two tours, I discovered my creative talents in writing and inventing. To date, I've created three patents and 300+ innovative, mixed genre patent concepts and numerous mixed genres of novel concepts. I am presenting (2) board games for this crowdfunding to help expedite pushing them through the hurdles associated with upcoming full production runs.

 
 
 
 
 
Above and beyond 
 Your contribution enables the launch of the board games and supports the funding goal that reduces cost, to make it more affordable at the introductory inception. Most of all, your contributions will enable the creation of more products that will eventually help those affected by the pandemic should they sign up for the COVID Campaign which is aimed at helping those financially crashed by creating legitimate, small-scale businesses they can run from the comfort of their home.  
NOTE: Not included; my new Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) “VIRA Shield 2000” (VS2000)/Patent pending #63,024,837; submitted to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) on 05/14/2020. Plans are to launch the VS-2000 in January 2021.
Goal
My goal is to help 100k people become millionaires and another million generate a recurring income! More in-depth info  on my website: www.STITCHUZ.com
Business Support
 Dynamic Dimenzions (STITCHUZ parent) launches mid-December. Due to COVID, I am launching my contingency plan, which assists those unemployed in starting their own legitimate business. Your support alone, kickstarts the boardgames; which ignites a self-sustaining business platform and mega job creator! I've already launched a strong marketing campaign on STITCHUZ.com, under “COVID Campaign.”   As I push more new, innovative products to the market, I am able to share more cost savings to those affected by the pandemic and enable them to put food on the table, pay bills, and still have enough money to restock their next order. This is nothing more than simply sharing, by drastically lowering my profit margin others can profit as well in these trying times. 
  Dynamic Dimenzions is a product creator that pushes recurring new products; starting with GRID-LOCX and CLICK! So, when you support this campaign, you are not just supporting a small project and founder but up to millions who can benefit from selling these and future products.

What We Need & What You Get
  We need to raise $420,000USDs for GRID-LOCX and CLICK! GRID-LOCX and CLICK! are not your standard flat board games; they have expanded layer decking (with GRID-LOCX), and moving components (with CLICK!) increases costs to manufacture. Due to the manufacturer's loss of time and wages, when setting up a small production run; this production effort becomes more costly. The cost listed below is for both games and is based on a 9.6K production runs per game.
NEW GRID-LOCX

GRID-LOCX and Components


A taste of the high-level rules: First; decide on the play level (long or short). If you have a hot head in the game, they can opt to play the extended version while others play the short version. This alone adds more excitement, and you really don’t know how the game will end, but that’s the excitement! Next, in a round-robin fashion, each player rolls the regular dice. The person with the highest number goes first.  The game is driven by plucking from the deck, following the instruction on the cards, and advancing around the board. There’s also: ""PICK’em & GO!"" And ""Hold-em!"" These are additional ways to play; in strategic or stealth mode, but not so fast; because as you advance, an opponent can land on your chip and put you in a holding pattern (onboard) until you draw a REGRID card that allows you to go back to the farthest start point.  This game demands your attention because if you are not alert you could easily lose!
There are 3 ways to win: (1) Card or dice your way off the board, (2) Collect all of one player's move pieces and, (3) attaining seven Wild Cards
Next, I’ll introduce you to the playing cards: 
The card on the left is the face cards duplicated on one side of all the cards and slightly resembles the games, box cover.

This card is used to exit the game. When drawn, you can begin moving your piece from the board, even if you are in the middle of the game.

When drawn, this card allows you to use the spinner to determine your next action on the board.

When drawn, this card allows you to use the spinner two times to determine your next action on the board. It also allows you to miss a turn should you spin a not so rewarding readout on the dial.

When drawn, this card allows you to move one of your pieces from your opponent's holding area and put your piece back in play by placing it in the farthest start area. 

This card, when drawn, is used to advance (8) spaces around the board. When drawn, you move your piece forward, (8) spaces.

When drawn, this card directs you to roll the dice the number of times conveyed by the (X).  

When drawn, this card directs you to roll the dice several times as conveyed and multiply the number of moves identified by the (X).  

This card, when drawn, cause you to lose a turn and pass to an opponent. It also allows them an opportunity to get ahead because they have the opportunity to roll twice.

This card, when drawn, allows you to snatch a player wild card. Should you collect 7 Wild cards such as the next card during the game, you instantly become the winner!

Retain (7) of these and instantly win! 

This card, when drawn, causes you to move backward on the game board. 

When drawn, this card causes you to lose a turn, and the game continues from the person the card is passed to, and the game continues in a round-robin fashion. 

When drawn, this card allows you to roll the special dice, which will allow you to either advance around the board or move your furthermost piece back to start. 

When drawn as stated, this card causes you to lose a turn and move to the next player in the round-robin.

When drawn, this card allows you to snatch two pieces from various opponents, holding areas, and hold them in your holding area. Collect all of one opponent's pieces, and you instantly win the game.

This adds more excitement, and you really don’t know how the game will end! Next, in a round-robin fashion, each player rolls the dice. The person with the highest number goes first. The game is driven by plucking from the deck, following the instruction on the cards, and advancing around the board but not so fast; because as you advance, the player can land on your move piece and block your move piece from advancing around the board. There are times when a skillful player may lock you in until the game is almost over, so you have to be skillful and tactful in placing your moving pieces and covering down on them as you advance around the board. The card or dice will determine how many clicks to the right; you spin the board to align your outer circle colors with the center colors. With Click! You also have the option of playing the game with the player holding cards to strategically plot to win, but not so fast because the middle platform is constantly spinning, so you have to have a very watchful eye as the clicks come and go! Like GRID-LOCX, the game is designed so that new players can join in at any time during the game.
*** NOTE: Cards are still under design

$8,000.00/Mold
$288,000.00/Full production run 9.6K each boardgame (to include Packaging, Assembly, Final Prototyping)
$4,000/Marketing campaign
$4,000/Advertising campaign
$4,000/Product marketing sampling
$800/Design Graphics Unlimited - No royalty design
$2,000/Product final tabletop testing
$8,000/Perk Incidentals (Product/Shipping/handling, editing, publishing, and printing)
$12,000/Bulk overseas shipping and local distribution (depending on shipment size)
$3,000/Multilingual instruction translation
$TBD/Crowd Fees
Sufficient Funding
With the right funding, we will push both GRID-LOCX and CLICK! to the forefront of tabletop gaming and make them household brands. Once on store-shelves, it is important to us that GRID-LOCX and CLICK! remains affordable and within reach for the majority of low to mid-level family budgets. The best way to achieve this is to use full-scale manufacturing to make the parts. However, the tooling necessary for full-scale manufacturing is a labor-intensive and costly process, requiring a huge upfront investment. Here is the best part... You can help get GRID-LOCX and CLICK! get through the hurdles of manufacturing and be one of the first to get your very own GRID-LOCX or/and CLICK! simply by contributing! Imagine your family members' faces when you come home with one of these games and surprise them!
Perks
Please take a look at some of the many cool rewards we have for my backers! I want my work in your hands and homes, so every pledge of $3 or more is all it takes! If you're compelled to contribute more, we've created some entertaining pledge experiences for your enjoyment. Our perks are copywritten, so outside of this campaign, you can only get them from our website.
Overfunding 
Should we exceed our goal, we'll stretch our creativity toward more production runs to support our COVID Campaign and continue to lower costs for the COVID businesses we support during the pandemic, so we can sustain as a mega job creator! The products listed become a part of the product line and products that we share. Your contributions help us reach our goal of being able to brand GRID-LOCX"" and CLICK! and sustain others that are less fortunate.
  I am currently wrapping up a new novel ""The Mirror in the Mirror,"" a horror/inspirational and SCI-FI novel in which ""GRID-LOCX"" and CLICK! are played and part of the plot.
  Also, additional funds will be used to ensure that everyone who contributes $150+ receives an autographed soft copy of ""The Mirror in the Mirror"" and its printed cover on (1) postcard, (1) wallet-size card, and (1) bookmarker. 
  The Impact

  Your contribution has a significant impact on the launch of the games because it allows us to lower production costs. And most of all, it helps those signed up for the COVID campaign by offering more products for their new businesses.  
  Dynamic Dimenzions is a global enterprise launch so the success of these games ignites a global outreach. The success of this project will one day contribute to the economic growth of the U.S. on a major scale and globally on a smaller scale. As the inventor of GRID-LOCX, I am ecstatic about the issuance of the patent in October of 2020 as well as the pending patent for CLICK which should be released soon.
Risks & Challenges
There is low to no risk for this project. The unforeseen risks are unpredictable taxes and unpredictable overseas shipping costs associated with bulk shipping.  With 25 plus years in the civil sector as a contractor and functioning in program and project management, I don't foresee any challenges that can't be easily and expeditiously mitigated with focus. 
Other Ways You Can Help
If you are one of the over 16 million or more people out of a job; we understand that you may not be able to contribute, but if you have access to the internet you can help spread the word about the Indigogo campaign and even more so; the COVID campaign for those eager to get back on their feet. Thanks in advance for any way that you can help push this campaign forward and make some noise about GRID-LOCX and CLICK!, by using your Indiegogo share tools! Thanks for your time. Take care and stay safe!
SHIPPING:
To provide the best GRID-LOCX and CLICK! Backer experience, we offer a great discount on shipping and handling for backers in the U.S. We continue to work through global shipping hubs worldwide to offer all of our backers' customs, friendly shipping without any additional VAT/duties costs. The shipping fee will be charged as you place your pledge, based on the package's actual costs. We will collect the delivery information at the end of the campaign and ship your rewards from our warehouse once production is completed, and the products have been shipped to us. The shipping fee is sorted into roughly (3) zones:
Zone A ($10 USD): USA, France, United Kingdom, Japan, China, Macau, and Hong Kong.
Zone B ($10): Europe: Germany, Republic of Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Switzerland, Austria, Denmark, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Czech Republic, Canada, and Australia.
Zone C ($10-15): Rest of the world.
We cannot guarantee delivery to PO Box. 
All bulk customs fees will be billed to me; no extra payment should be apart from the pledge you make. Bear in mind that these are just estimates and that costs may be based on weight increases due to your final pledge selection.

We are proud to be able to offer you a three-year warranty on any defective parts. The returns of parts will be handled through our website. You must submit a copy of the paperwork received with your perks shipment for validation. When sending the product, please send a SASE big enough to ship the product without damage.  
RULE BOOK
We are still researching the cost to have the instructions translated into various languages, but for now, we will say that the rulebook for the game will be available in English, Spanish, Chinese, and French! You will be able to access other language rule books we have translated in pdf after the campaign ends.

ECO FRIENDLY

As an environmental contributor, during the pre-production process, the plan is to ensure we use environmentally friendly parts but keep in mind that it may not be feasible to make the game 100% environmentally friendly due to the complexity of the game. In any case, there is a commitment to continual environmental safety. Where we see that we can “Go Green” will assess that avenue. Our focus is on creating a safe and healthy environment for our products and our users.
GLOBAL PROJECTIONS

 
To gain a stronghold in the market, we will project GRID-LOCX and CLICK! to the world in a total retail, network, and wholesale setting. We quickly expand across the globe through various external website campaigns into a bigger market segment in record-breaking time. Our networking strategy enables the transition of GRID-LOCX and CLICK! into higher, more respectable market shares when networking on a global stage, when translating the instructions into various languages. This allows GRID-LOCX and CLICK's a major push in the Continental United States (CONUS) and outside the Continental United States (OCONUS).
EXPENSES BY THE NUMBERS

To date; $50,000 has been exhausted in GRID-LOCX and CLICK! from personal checking, personal savings, business checking, business savings, Roth, and 401K. No business debt or equity has been established. Funding has been used for: market sampling, research, and development, business researches, product sampling, invention prototyping, product testing, business planning, novel editing, self-publishing, printing, framing.
Bottom line: We are 100% committed to the GRID-LOCX and CLICK! campaign. Please help spread the word about the GRID-LOCX and CLICK! campaign! Your generosity and enthusiasm in sharing our link with friends, family, groups, forums, and websites, and telling everyone you meet who has an interest in board games, in general, will make a huge difference. We need each person who may be interested in pledging to know about this campaign in plenty of time so they can join in too, and we can make our ambitious GRID-LOCX and CLICK! campaign a big success!
The BIGGER PICTURE!
Please remember that by pledging to this campaign, you are directly helping to support the creation of jobs for those financially crushed by the pandemic because GRID-LOCX and CLICK! will eventually be sold by people who are financially affected as they join our COVID Relief Campaign that we are running on our website. Based on the success of the Indiegogo campaign and COVID campaign, we believe we will be able to meet and exceed all goals in record time. 
Thanks so much for your support!",57.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi! My alias is Joozey, also known as RPGPapercrafts. I'm a paper engineer, artist and developer, as well as a dungeon master and an author of D&amp;D adventures and supplements.</p>
<p>I started this campaign to help fund the production and assembly process of pop-up maps for tabletop role-play games. Technology has reached a point where custom made pop-up books can be produced again without intense labor, and I want to take advantage of that for the tabletop community. But printing, cutting and assembling still is not cheap! So I need your help to make pop-up maps a reality.</p>
<p>Your contribution would help me immensely in my quest. You're not just funding this map, but help show that pop-up maps can be a feasible product. You help me keep going on this path!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The goal I need to reach is 1500 euro. Roughly half of this budget will be spend to printing, cutting and creasing all the parts of the map. The other half covers the cost (my time) into assembling all the maps, sending them to you, designing new maps, writing updates, and more.</p>
<p>So what do you get out of this? Well, that depends on the tiers you choose! I've set up a variety of tiers with additional options. Buy one or more maps in digital blueprint, a do-it-yourself box, or fully assembled! Plus, you can choose for summer, autumn and winter editions of the map. </p>
</div><div>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>If this campaign succeeds, we will have pop-up scenery available on the market. These landscapes are relatively cheap, add another level to your table games, super easy to store, and brings that unique feeling of paper-based role-play games.</p>

</div></div>","Short Summary
Hi! My alias is Joozey, also known as RPGPapercrafts. I'm a paper engineer, artist and developer, as well as a dungeon master and an author of D&D adventures and supplements.
I started this campaign to help fund the production and assembly process of pop-up maps for tabletop role-play games. Technology has reached a point where custom made pop-up books can be produced again without intense labor, and I want to take advantage of that for the tabletop community. But printing, cutting and assembling still is not cheap! So I need your help to make pop-up maps a reality.
Your contribution would help me immensely in my quest. You're not just funding this map, but help show that pop-up maps can be a feasible product. You help me keep going on this path!
 

What We Need & What You Get
The goal I need to reach is 1500 euro. Roughly half of this budget will be spend to printing, cutting and creasing all the parts of the map. The other half covers the cost (my time) into assembling all the maps, sending them to you, designing new maps, writing updates, and more.
So what do you get out of this? Well, that depends on the tiers you choose! I've set up a variety of tiers with additional options. Buy one or more maps in digital blueprint, a do-it-yourself box, or fully assembled! Plus, you can choose for summer, autumn and winter editions of the map. 

 
The Impact
If this campaign succeeds, we will have pop-up scenery available on the market. These landscapes are relatively cheap, add another level to your table games, super easy to store, and brings that unique feeling of paper-based role-play games.
For the past six months I've publicized my research and work on social media.

<h3>Trial and Errors: 4 years of designing and testing</h3>
<p>Makiavelia is the result of 4 years of work and is the result of many iteration. In fact the current version of the game is number 16.2 (16 version, second edition). The game has been tested from 4 players up to 10 players, with board game fans and people who never played board games before. These play-testers provided every time good feedback so as to improve the game and I'm hoping to receive more feedback in the future once the game is published to improve potential future editions and / or expansions.</p>
<p>Here are pics of play-testers trying version 16.1:</p>

<h3>What People Say</h3>
<p>Here are reviews from people who played the game (slightly edited grammatically):</p>
<p><strong>Chatchanis </strong>said: ""<i>Makiavelia is a good combination of strategy, teamwork, betrayal, and game-play. It has a good player number and duration, which suits party game for casual player or those who play board games regularly like myself. I'm looking forward to the final edition of the game.</i>""</p>
<p><strong>Jade</strong> said: ""<i>This game is great fun! Besides tactics, the design of this beautiful card game really catches the eye and the design is always aesthetically pleasing. It's a diplomatic game, with many different ways to play out your strategies. And you can discover the hidden personality of the players throughout the game also.</i>""</p>
<p><strong>Iris </strong>said: ""<i>I’m not a big fan of board games normally, but even for beginners like myself, Makiavelia is very gripping, unconventional, unpredictable, fun and yet challenging. You need team work, strategic mind and wittiness. One of the positive aspects of this game is it’s for all age groups starting from early teens to pensioners. Different players will respond differently to the game, but all will have fun!

<h3>What We Need</h3>
<p>Makiavelia is the culmination of 4 years of work, from first concept, to designing and testing. I spent the last few months perfecting the game’s rules and feedback to improve the game, leading to the very first tangible copy of Makiavelia. Today, I decided to go a step further and bring the game to more people as a final product, hoping more people can enjoy the game as much as me and my friends did.</p>
<p>In order to do so, however, I’ll need your help. The minimum required quantity is <strong>1,000 copies</strong>, and before fully investing in the production, I want to ensure enough people are committed to buying Makiavelia. If together we can raise <strong>6,000 USD (about 170 copies of the game sold)</strong>, then I can complete the investment and proceed to launching the full production of Makiavelia.</p>
<p>After the sum is collected, the production will take about a month to finalize. I decided to work with a factory near home, in Bangkok, to work closely with the printer and ensure the product meets the quality standards I am aiming for. This ought to be a quality product too, as my wish is to deliver to you the best version of Makiavelia.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533960749/ud4kccf2edwn50e2e6ws.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The next step will be to contact distributors and share the Makiavelia goodness with as many people as possible. Should we exceed the target significantly, then I will increase the production to issue Makiavelia in other languages.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this project goes beyond Makiavelia: depending on the initial success of this funding, it could mean more adventures: as designer and producer, I have more projects in the pipeline and we could grow my publishing company “Othergames” to bring more fun and exciting games to your tabletop.</p>
<h3>Pre-order</h3>
<p>With Indiegogo, you get the opportunity to pre-order Makiavelia. I will send you the box immediately after manufacturing is complete, which means it should be with you by November.</p>
<p>You may <strong>pre-order a single box set</strong>, which comes with a desktop wallpaper set, of which the download link will be sent to your email address.</p>
<p>If you're a shop, organisation or if you wish to make a collective order for you and some friends, you may <strong>pre-order a 5 box set</strong> or a <strong>10 box set</strong>, in which case you will receive them free of shipping costs, saving up to an estimated 28%.</p>
<p>In either cases, your contribution will be printed in the rule-book among the list of co-founders of Makiavelia.</p>
<div><h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3></div>
<div>
<p>Maybe you can't contribute to this project. Maybe you're not that into tabletop games. That's okay.</p>
<p>However, maybe some of your friends, family or community members are! So here's what you can do to help:</p>

<li>
<strong>Send a tip!</strong> among perks, you have the option to donate 1 USD to support the project or a 3 USD with Makiavelia wallpaper set as a gift.</li>

<h3>About the Author</h3>
<p>Hi! My name is Benjamin and I’m the developer and designer of Makiavelia. Since my teenage years I was never content with simply playing board games, but always wanted to make my own modified versions. It always remained a hobby, until 4 years ago, when the idea of making Makiavelia became an obsession.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1533371681/t2sxsaqtnaoy2edlteql.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Why did I want to make Makiavelia? Well it’s a combo of various game mechanics and themes I love, but with some unique elements that I was missing in every other games. First I wanted a backstabber’s game, but not one where the winning player is sure to win. In Makiavelia, victory is never assured and the odds could turn around at any time. Second I wanted to have a card-combination strategy game which can be played in many ways, but that isn’t too difficult to play and where players do not need to buy an endless amount of collectible cards. Finally, I wanted a social game, where people get time to be together and collaborate or betray one another, but all in good fun.</p>
<p>If Makiavelia is well received, the I will continue producing. I have few games in draft and I’m already working with some Hollywood production companies to make more versions of Makiavelia, using your favorite movie and series. I let you guess which ;)</p>
<h3>Risks and challenges</h3>
<p>4 years of work on Makiavelia have led to perfecting the game through testing and feedback.</p>
<p>The primary goal and associated risk, is to ensure there are enough committed buyers to proceed to production. The project is first and foremost to bring Makiavela to life.</p>
<p>The second risk lies with delivery. Although I am confident about the manufacturer being able to deliver a quality product on time, there’s always a chance of delay. I’d hate have backers waiting.</p>
<p>The third risk concerns distribution, since the minimum production is 1000 boxes, it makes only sense to try to share Makiavelia through board game distributors. There’s a risk this process may last longer than expected and that Makiavelia doesn’t make it on time of Xmas in local board game shops.</p>
<p>However, the sooner we find backers to support Makiavelia, the lower will be all these risks</p>

<h3>What is Shadow?</h3>

<p>Shadow is a trick-taking card game for 2-8 players.

The quest of the players to navigate from the starting point, across the map, pass through unexpected obstacles, take a few advantages, and reaches the finish line first. The game offers <strong>multidimensional </strong>experiences ranging from <strong>geographical education</strong>, <strong>suspense</strong>, <strong>tactics</strong>, <strong>logical moves</strong>, and so <strong>much excitement</strong>. Each experience develops the brain and keeps the mind highly enlightened.</p>
<p>Our achieved goal is to create interactive, fun, adventurous, and educational content in a single board game. Yay! we did it. </p>
<p>We will continue <strong>creating more boards</strong> in this <strong>game collection</strong> to contain <strong>many countries</strong> and all the <strong>continents</strong>. They will all be tailored to the same amount of excitement, fun, and learning for all age groups. <br/>Though all the boards will have the same concept of the country's map and city activities, each will create a very <strong>unique learning pattern</strong>, <strong>rules</strong>, and <strong>iconic playing objects </strong>and so much more. Please subscribe so we can reach you when these boards are available in the market. </p>
<p>We are passionate about this game because we see the <strong>advantage </strong>of it <strong>bonding families </strong>and <strong>building friendships </strong>through <strong>interaction</strong>, <strong>learning</strong>, and <strong>discovering</strong> new things that we all love.</p>
<h3><strong>About The Game</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Round The Country</strong> is designed to create fun and learning for players. The game board has the map of the <strong>United States of America,</strong> and <strong>other countries</strong> for <strong>other board designs</strong> and quest paths from the starting point to finish. Players navigate across the states through the paths by rolling the dice. Along the path, the players will face setbacks, suspenseful activities, questions, and intellectual responses from drawn playing cards.</p>
<p><strong>More boards will be added to the collection </strong>by <strong>August 2021</strong> with <strong>different countries</strong>, each with its unique rules, activities, and learning.  </p>
<p>Each gameboard comprises a glossy finished surface, <strong>TWO</strong> dice, <strong>TWENTY </strong>poker-sized<strong> </strong>playing cards, <strong>FOUR </strong>playing objects (<strong><i>we are converting these objects to country's iconic figures</i></strong>), and a <strong>playing manual</strong>. </p>
<p>The board is a <strong>.078inch</strong> thick paper board, <strong>24inches </strong>long x <strong>18inches </strong>wide, and when folded, it is <strong>12inches </strong>x <strong>9inches, </strong>the size of a notebook.   </p>

<h3><strong>HOW TO PLAY THE GAME</strong></h3>
<p>The game is so easy to play but requires deep thinking, collaboration, and good decision-making to win the opponent(s). Two or more players can play it at the same time.</p>
<p>There are<strong> 64 landing positions</strong> between the start and the finish points on the board. Each position is given a color-coded circle number on the board starting from 1 to 64.</p>
<p>There are <strong>FIVE color-coded circles </strong>along the traveling paths<strong> </strong>on the board. Players are required to start at home location <strong>1</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>The Educative Attributes:</strong> One of the first things players would learn playing this game is the ease of identifying the states and their respective capital. Because it is fun to play, players will easily and quickly learn about great locations in the country, learn about key activities in major cities, and the game cards are packed with interactive activities to engage the players in dialoguing and exchanging thoughts for a victory. <strong>Parents </strong>will find <strong>teaching </strong>their children <strong>very</strong> <strong>easy </strong>and <strong>fun</strong>. They can teach their children about any country by simply playing the game continuously.  Do not miss out on the updated boards and boards with other country's maps.  This game also has some elements of <strong>math</strong>, <strong>history</strong>, <strong>geography</strong>, and other <strong>interesting facts about countries.   </strong></p>

<p><strong>The Fun Side:</strong> Now, let's get down to the grand scheme of things. This is the part we are excited to share with you. This game will have you so excited from the start, it is full of suspense, as you think you are heading to the finish line, you might be in for a big setback. You will never know what is coming your way, lol!  </p>
<p>There are <strong>FIVE </strong>(5) <strong>categories </strong>of <strong>cards </strong>on the board, each can quickly change your path to victory. Each time a player lands on a circle, depending on the color of the circle, the player draws a card of the same color with the circle he or she landed on. The player has to follow the instructions on the card as stated.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620500145/foj40fhgcm1ncszghflz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The <strong>Green Cards </strong>cards are mile credits a player would earn for doing the right things similar to everyday commute in the real world. Green cards can give you the advantage of reaching the finish line faster, but there is no guarantee. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620435896/pvez3ixw8choeijbhym7.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The <strong>Red Cards</strong> could slow you down or divert players in their race to the finish line. Players will need to respond logically and tactically to veer around the country. Perfect answers are not the only prerequisite for points, but the <strong>more accurate</strong> and <strong>logical a player's answers </strong>are, the <strong>higher the chances to earn more points</strong> that will advance the farther. It is up to the players to make the call how close answers. Every answer and point can be challenged reasonably. But certainly, the <strong>wrong answer has a consequence</strong>. So players must engage and dialogue well enough with each other throughout the playtime. Players do not have to be too quick to give answers but have to be confident of their responses. The players should note that some instructions will <strong>require looking up explanations in books and asking someone else. </strong>This game could take the players to research h<strong>istories</strong>, <strong>geographic </strong>materials, and other <strong>academic </strong>information.  </p>

<p> </p>
<p>The <strong>Gray Cards</strong> are game instructions to <strong>exempt</strong> players or <strong>minimize </strong>the impacts due to other <strong>harsh </strong>instructions. The player with the gray card can only hold it for a certain period of time and can use it anytime within the frame of time he or she possess the card.  </p>
<p>There is a <strong>secret</strong> <strong>pathway </strong>but you have to work so hard to earn it. This will not be shared here because it is a secret you have to discover by yourself when you play the game. The <strong>trick changes</strong> for every game, so<strong> it remains a secret</strong>. </p>
<p>The <strong>Brown Cards</strong> are generally setbacks, and players cannot avoid all of them. You have to hold your breath until you have moved past the brown positions. </p>
<p><strong>Yellow Cards</strong> are a <strong>consequential assessment</strong> of players as the game progresses.  </p>
<p>We are overexcited about how the combination of the cards creates an integrated mental and emotional excitement and fun, finesse, suspense, and so much unknown expectations throughout the playtime.  </p>

<h3><strong>Children's Board</strong></h3>
<p>We are advancing a special board designed for children. The <strong>children's board </strong>will <strong>create </strong><strong>additional learning</strong> and even <strong>more fun-filled experiences</strong>. Children will be able to <strong>learn </strong>about many <strong>countries</strong>, <strong>animals </strong>common to countries, <strong>places</strong>, basic <strong>histories</strong>, <strong>tourisms</strong> and many more.

</ul></div>","Taking notes or keeping track of your game is a tricky issue. Campaign Journal helps documenting your game so it is neat, tidy and easy for you to look for pieces of information later.  Campaign Journal is a faux-leather cover binding, filled with booklets specially designed to help you document your games, whether you’re a GM or a player. We have two editions for the product: GM Edition and Player Edition. The GM Edition contains booklets for documenting your:

Setting: for writing about the history of your setting, pantheon and cosmology, creating a world map, describing your regions, organizations and explaining the technology present in your setting.

Campaign: for documenting your plot, the background of your campaign, where it’s placed in the world, who the player characters are, the regions and locations where the story takes place, recurring NPCs, enemies, important organizations and rewards.

Adventure: has space for writing the dates of your adventure, the background or context, the goals, quests, locations, events, encounters and rewards. Finally you can document your encounters with XP, difficulty, participants, description, rewards and a squared grid to draw where the encounter takes place.

NPCs: you can describe your created characters with a portrait, residence, appearance and equipment, stats, occupation and history, mannerism, talent, abilities, useful info, interactions with others, ideal, bond, and flaw or secret.

Locations: lets you define a big settlement, with its appearance, government, defense and recurring NPCs; and several places within that settlement, with their placement, appearance, notable NPCs, hooks and a squared grid to draw the layout of the place.

Dungeon: is perfect for creating your dungeon, describing its placement, major enemies, minor enemies, NPCs, background of the dungeon, a squared grid to draw the layout of the dungeon and space to describe what the different rooms in it contain.
 The Player Edition has the following booklets:

People: for describing the different NPCs and PCs you encounter, with their residence, description and miscellaneous information.

Places: here you can write about the places you go, their placement within the settlement or the world, the NPCs there, and miscellaneous information.

Campaign Notes: is the booklet you will use most during play, with space to write the date of the session, to-do, important things to remember, rewards you got in the session, additional notes, and brief space to write about people you meet, places you go.
 Each and every one of these booklets can be removed from the cover binding, rearranged, replaced, etc, so you can use the same cover for different games changing your set of booklets, or add more booklets if you need them (for example, if you have a lot of NPCs and need another booklet).  
Has different pockets for storing your game props or tools, like maps, initiative cards, spell cards, printed stat blocks, letters for the players, etc.

System-agnostic, so it can be used for any tabletop RPG game, to take your notes or prepare your campaign.

Stylish design, resembling an antique book.

Comfortable to store all the material you need for your game.

Easy to fill in and for taking orderly notes.

Reusable, you can use the cover for different games just changing the set of booklets.

High quality paper of 106 gsm weight; it doesn't ghost or bleed with most pens.
 What does 'system-agnostic' mean? It means it can be used with any Tabletop RPG game. We have identified the common features in several games, and Campaign Journal's content is designed to help you prepare, decument and play your favorite game in a way that's easier for you.All Tabletop RPGs have settings, people, locations -every setting has a universe -or universes that has stories and people living in it. We have special prizes for you if you decide to pledge to our campaign. Here is the list of rewards according to each tier:  Campaign Journal is created by Francita and Pablo, under the brand Brynlis by francita. We are a couple of designers from Chile, very passionate about tabletop RPGs, so we decided to put our skills to design products for us players, to make our games more interesting.

<h3>THE IDEA</h3>
<p>The idea for such a deck started when I started using simplistic decks. But they always had a problem, they couldn't be or weren't marked. So i set out to create a deck that would be simple, MARKED, as well as handle like butter. Magicians know how powerful and useful gaffs like Double  backers and duplicate cards are, so thats what aspire to deliver.</p>
<p>ALSO, they look absolutely breathtaking in motion, due to the boxes, as you see in the trailer, making them perfect for cardistry!</p>
<ul>
<li>Simplistic back design best for performing magic, cardistry, as well as Card games.</li>
<li>Luxury stock and gaffs makes it perfect for Performers.</li>
<li>Square design looks great in cardistry</li>
<li>FULLY MARKED</li>
<li>Pre-stacked in mnemonica order </li>
<li>Limited edition 1 of 1000 decks, no reprints ever.</li>
</ul>
<p>An idea as such can only be funded with YOUR help. Every dollar helps. Support this project and help Supreme playing cards come to life.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Heres a little breakdown for where your contribution will be going.</p>
<ul>
<li>The production price for the decks is about 4000$ Plus there is Handling fees, Plate fees, as well as Packaging and storage fee, and very little profit for me.</li>
<li>All this equates to around 4500$ for printing the decks. Thus the goal is $5000, the extra 500$ being shipping charges compensation.</li>
<li>If we don't complete the funding goal within the 45 day period, no one will be charged.</li>

ALSO, they look absolutely breathtaking in motion, due to the boxes, as you see in the trailer, making them perfect for cardistry!

Simplistic back design best for performing magic, cardistry, as well as Card games.
Luxury stock and gaffs makes it perfect for Performers.
Square design looks great in cardistry
FULLY MARKED

Limited edition 1 of 1000 decks, no reprints ever.

<h3>Who we are</h3>
<p>My name is Denys and together with my friends I have been dealing with social services for many years. We have successfully organized various social projects aiming at the improvement of youth position in our society, implementing non-formal education and inspiring the rise of social values in lives of young people. </p>
<p>My friends and I have created a very cool game which kills two birds with one stone. To be more exact, you will definitely have fun playing and it will also give you a chance to check up on friends, old mates or acquaintances who you have lost touch with. </p>
<p>You will need to call a person from your contacts who will be able to give a correct answer in order to play or even win the game.</p>
<h3>About the game</h3>
<p>Do you know which of your friends, acquaintances or just random people from your contact list is keen on music, geography, sports, films and cartoons or other areas of life?</p>
<p>Are you ready to compete with your friends and prove that your contacts are the best?</p>
<p>If ‘yes’, then <strong>this game is what you need</strong>!</p>
<p>If you usually play with your closest friends and yet you miss those who are far away this is your solution. The need to unite friends is exactly what inspired us to create “The Contacts: call or lose”. We tried it and it turned out to be much more fun than we expected! </p>
<p>This game can be played <i>at parties, at home with family, at school, while traveling outside the city or anywhere else</i>. Just make sure you take your phone and the game cards.</p>
<p>We bet you will have fun!</p> <p>There are 500 questions from completely different areas of our life in “The Contacts: call or lose”.  For example, ‘Which Italian city is built on water?’ or ‘Which movie characters speak Banana language?'</p>
<p>It doesn't really matter whether you know the answer or not ( you will actually see the answer when you take a card ha-ha). You just need to choose the right person to call and ask. </p>

<p>In this fast-paced, engaging game, players take on the role of conspiracy theorists and compete against each other to explain their theories about the world around them. </p>
<p>With over 200 cards in the game the possibilities for new random stories is virtually endless, an ideal party game for players who like comedy and story-telling.</p>
<p>We are looking to gain further support in this game to make sure as many people as possible have the chance to get a copy of It's Just A Theory when it is produced and enjoy playing the game as much as we and our play testers have done.</p>

<p>Download the alpha print and play file and rules to try it yourself from our <a href=""http://www.itsjustatheorycardgame.co.uk/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">website</a></p>
<p>Players work against each other to create a conspiracy theory, using ‘'Fact'’ cards that contain concepts or objects which can be used to form conspiracy theories. In a round, one player is the lead conspiracy theorist who will begin a theory using one of their ''Conspiracy'' cards. The lead conspiracy theorist then uses their pool of ""Fact"" cards to move the story in certain directions with the aim of allowing them to finish their theory by playing a ''Propaganda'' card. The more “Fact” cards they play in a chain the more points they score.</p>
<p><strong>How to Interrupt</strong></p>
<p>There are several interruption mechanisms available in It's Just A Theory</p>
<p>1) If the current Lead Conspiracy Theorist mentions the contents of another player's card, either as part of their theory or in response to a question (player's may question the Lead Conspiracy Theorist at any point), they may take over the theory.</p>
<p>2) If a player believes they have a better theory or explanation to the current ''Fact'' or ''Propaganda'' card. Other players may then vote to allow the challenger to take over the theory or not.</p>
<p>3) Playing a ''Greater Conspiracy'' card. If the theme of the most recent ''Fact'' card matches a green Conspiracy card with the ''Greater Conspiracy'' watermark in a player's hand, they may play this card immediately to take control of the theory. Doing this the player can now restart the theory from this ''Greater Conspiracy'' card.</p>
<h3>How to Win</h3>
<p>The winner of a round is the player who plays their Propaganda card ending the theory. Points are scored by finishing theories with more points awarded for every card in the finishing players uninterrupted chain. </p>

<p><strong>Unique Conspiracy Crafting Card Game</strong></p>
<p>It's Just A Theory is a unique spin on the story telling mechanic using outlandish ideas based on real 'conspiracy theories'.</p>
<p>We enjoy story telling card games and RPGs. It’s Just A Theory uses features we love from such games like Once Upon A Time to provide a new, fresh, easier to play, version of the story telling concept. It’s Just A Theory couples the story telling mechanic with a voting system, which creates a fun, dynamic party game that can easily lead to hilarious conversations and debates. We feel this system of voting coupled with interrupts and debates allows for the game to be played by a wide range of people, from seasoned story tellers, to people interested in the concept of conspiracy theories. </p>
<p><u>To summarise; It’s Just A Theory is unique as it combines collaborative story telling with voting, which means you have to convince others of your conspiracy theories, as well as yourself.  You're guaranteed to have hours of fun playing this game.</u></p>
<p><strong>Easy to Learn, Quick to Play</strong></p>
<p>It's Just a Theory can be played within minutes of opening the box. We've designed the core rules to be as simple as possible whilst retaining an interesting and challenging depth to the game. The rules allow for players of all skill levels to quickly learn and play the game, whilst also challenging veteran players to develop new strategies. (i.e. knowing what card a player may be alluding to in their challenge and providing alternate explanations to retain play).</p>
<p><strong>Initial print exclusive Content</strong></p>
<p>As our first group of loyal backers, you will be entitled to a unique set of rewards with your game. </p>
<p><strong>Play Tested Extensively</strong></p>
<p>The game has been play tested for over a year by the designers and friends and blind play testers over 200 times. But don't take our word for it, check the comments or even download the Beta copy.</p>
<p> <strong>Replayable</strong></p>
<p>The game has a vast number of cards that can be used in a multitude of combinations, meaning that you can pick it up and have a fun game each time you play it, with new and exciting theories told every time.

<p>We are a small independent games company based in the United Kingdom with a desire to create fun, unique and entertaining games. We founded early 2016 by a few friends with a passion for board gaming. This is our first game which we hope you enjoy playing as much as we do</p>
<p> </p>
<p><u><strong>How It Started</strong></u></p>
<p>It's Just A Theory started by accident, in an attempt at procrastination whilst one of the creators was writing their thesis. He quickly he needed help and enlisted long-time friends to aid in development of the game concept.  </p>
<p>After a few weeks the basic idea for It's Just A Theory was formed and an initial deck (on pen and paper) was developed. The developers were eager to gain other views and naturally headed to the local pub with friends, to do some serious play testing. The best part of this session was that one of the play testers genuinely thought this was a Print and Play game that already existed saying ''But this seems like a proper game.'' From this it was decided to Kickstart the game to share it as widely as possible with other board game enthusiasts.</p>
<p>The development of this game has been a great learning curve for us and allowed us to engage with so many great people, all enthusiastic about boardgames and development. We really love It's Just A Theory and really enjoy story-telling card games. One of the key pieces of inspiration for this game has been the amount of fun we've had playing Once Upon A Time and we'd really like to share the great concept of story-telling games to others with a fresh update.</p>

<p><u><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></u></p>
<p>We have spent nearly 2 years play-testing and designing of the game itself.</p>
<p>In terms of risk associated with the project, we freely admit we are new to game development and it has been a steep learning curve.</p>
<p>Fortunately the boardgame design community is very friendly and open and have provided useful feedback and help with how to minimise the risk and deliver a high quality game to you.</p>
<p>We see the risk in this game as minimal, and the most significant of these being delays in time associated with when production will start. This is because we are designing over 200 unique cards. Whilst we have the concepts for well over 200 cards ready, as seen on our alpha deck, we need to finalise the art work for the 200 cards. <br/>We have already made ~50 of these cards which we have been putting around our social media platforms to gain feedback to optimise. But we admit there is a risk in delays in the process of conceptualizing and getting our artist to design every card to a high standard that we like and would be proud to put out to you. <br/>Of course during the campaign we will still work on this and keep you updated as to the state of card design.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we will provide you with a high quality product and hope you enjoy playing It's Just A Theory as much as we have designing it.</p>
</div></div>","We are already funded on Kickstarter and finalising designs for production process.

 
In this fast-paced, engaging game, players take on the role of conspiracy theorists and compete against each other to explain their theories about the world around them. 
With over 200 cards in the game the possibilities for new random stories is virtually endless, an ideal party game for players who like comedy and story-telling.
We are looking to gain further support in this game to make sure as many people as possible have the chance to get a copy of It's Just A Theory when it is produced and enjoy playing the game as much as we and our play testers have done.


Download the alpha print and play file and rules to try it yourself from our website
Players work against each other to create a conspiracy theory, using ‘'Fact'’ cards that contain concepts or objects which can be used to form conspiracy theories. In a round, one player is the lead conspiracy theorist who will begin a theory using one of their ''Conspiracy'' cards. The lead conspiracy theorist then uses their pool of ""Fact"" cards to move the story in certain directions with the aim of allowing them to finish their theory by playing a ''Propaganda'' card. The more “Fact” cards they play in a chain the more points they score.
How to Interrupt
There are several interruption mechanisms available in It's Just A Theory
1) If the current Lead Conspiracy Theorist mentions the contents of another player's card, either as part of their theory or in response to a question (player's may question the Lead Conspiracy Theorist at any point), they may take over the theory.
2) If a player believes they have a better theory or explanation to the current ''Fact'' or ''Propaganda'' card. Other players may then vote to allow the challenger to take over the theory or not.
3) Playing a ''Greater Conspiracy'' card. If the theme of the most recent ''Fact'' card matches a green Conspiracy card with the ''Greater Conspiracy'' watermark in a player's hand, they may play this card immediately to take control of the theory. Doing this the player can now restart the theory from this ''Greater Conspiracy'' card.
How to Win
The winner of a round is the player who plays their Propaganda card ending the theory. Points are scored by finishing theories with more points awarded for every card in the finishing players uninterrupted chain. 
The winner is the conspiracy theorist who has the most points at the end of the game. So don your tinfoil hat, open your third eye, ensure your subcutaneous xenoestrogen injection unit is charged and prepare to discover truths you did not know about the world, and remember:

<h2>Game of Choice - A Party Game (17+)</h2>
<p>Game of choice is a party game that will keep you and your friends entertained for hours upon end. Here's the run-down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each player is dealt 9 scenario cards.<strong> </strong>For example, <strong>""Funnel a fifth of Orloff wearing assless chaps.""</strong>
</li>
<li>Each player anonymously hands the dealer a scenario card. </li>
<li>The dealer chooses which scenario card he/she would rather do, and the player who handed that card to the dealer wins a point. The first player to reach seven points lives happily ever after (<strong>A.K.A. wins the game</strong>).</li>

<h2>How It Works (In Detail)</h2>
<h3>Step 1:</h3>
<p>Each player is dealt nine cards (three awesome, three awful and three neutral). </p>
<p><b>Awesome Cards..</b></p>

<h3><strong>Step 2:</strong></h3>
<p><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">The dealer rolls an obnoxiously large die to set the category. Just like the scenario cards, the category can be <strong>awesome, awful or neutral. </strong></span></p>
<h3>Step 3:</h3>
<p>Each player anonymously hands the dealer a card of their choosing based on the category rolled. (hint: the strategy of the game is to accurately guess which card your dealer will choose, so if Mike hates crusty couch pizza, <strong>DON'T</strong> give him crusty couch pizza!)</p>
<h3>Final Step!</h3>
<p>The dealer assesses his/her cards then reads all of them out loud. After some thought, the dealer states which scenario he would rather do and awards a point to the player who handed him/her that card. The first player to seven points<strong> </strong>lives happily ever after <strong>(A.K.A. wins the game)!</strong></p>
<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>About two years ago Sierra and I <strong>(a.k.a the team)</strong> randomly stopped what we were doing, sat down and decided we were going to come up with a slam dunk (awesome) idea. After about an hour of thinking really, really hard, Game of Choice was born. </p>

<p><strong>Why Game of Choice? </strong>There are so many new inventions that don't really make much of a difference in the world, and so few inventions that do the simple job of making people laugh. The days of sitting down with our friends and family to play hilarious card games seem to be dwindling down, but we think its about time to reignite that flame. </p>
<p><strong>How long did it take us?</strong> 510 hilarious scenario cards aren't something you think of overnight. In fact, it took us about two years to have each card finished (keep in mind, our standard for awesome and awful cards was pretty high). Once the game was finished, we sat down and decided that the best way to raise the money we needed (and get the word out) was to launch an Indiegogo campaign.</p>

<h2>RISKS &amp; CHALLENGES</h2>

<p>GP is a relatively simple game to put together (it took about 15 minutes to put it together from scratch when we did it manually).

<p>With this in mind we decided to keep the rewards tier as simple as possible. This is because we want to fulfill our rewards as soon as possible, and get GP out there.</p>
<p>It will be our first shot at productionizing the process, so we are both anxious and hopeful. Our chosen producer has a good track record of productionizing toys so that does make us feel very confident.</p>

WHATS IN THE BOX
1 plastic mould table 
dimensions: 28"" long, 20"" wide, stands at 7""
rubber finishes on grip handles



3 plastic mould pieces each team:1 runner      - the piece that can score touchdowns


2 blockers - pieces that can drop the opposition runner

 
LOOK AND FEEL OF GP

Gridiron PowerRun (GP) is a table game much like Foosball but for American Football except in GP you control free-moving pieces on the table. Because of the GP table's rounded bottom, you do this by simply tilting the table around and the pieces move, its really that simple to maneuver. 
 
 
The pieces are rigged with a propulsion mech that allows them to move forward and turn when the table is tilted. Just hold the handles and tilt the table, and make the pieces 'run' around the field. Its very intuitive gameplay.

Propulsion mechanism

Some of the design features GP has:

Simple yet instantly recognisable table
round knob at the bottom for tilting gameplay
unique tilting gameplay. Just tilt the table to move the pieces
pieces move and turn on table and turn just like real players running and turning on a field

 
THE GAMEPLAY OF GP 

There are two sides: offense and defense.  Each side has a total of 3 pieces: 1 runner and 2 blockers. 
 

To play a game:

Place the pieces on the table at the appropriate yard line, and the objective is simple: get your runner to the end zone first before any opposition pieces.  
Avoid any of your pieces being tackled - that is a down, play switches at the yard line
Avoid any of the defense pieces reaching your end zone firstin this case it is a down and play switches at 50yard line

GP has many options to play. You can play:
1 vs 1 - the easiest . Just two pieces on the table. This is best for practicing to play GP.
2 vs 2 - this is medium level difficulty. Typically a down/touchdown lasts a couple of minutes.
3 vs 3 - hard difficulty level. 
You also have options to change the ball size for each piece, a heavier ball being faster but more difficult to control.
You have the option to change platform size for the blockers (the platform is the ring that the ball is in, and the piece stands on). This allows you to have greater flexibility with the blockers in terms of using heavier balls.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>We are Jacob and Kirra Sundese, a board game developing team and loving young parents of a beautiful 2-year-old boy! Dungeon Dash is a new and exciting board game that quite literally puts the ""F"" in ""Fun"". We have tested this game with friends and strangers as close as down the street and as far away as Nigeria and it has never failed to deliver a good time. It is the first of many games we have to offer in our new board game company, Knee Slapper Games. Our games stand out from others because we don't recycle last years' new board game with a ""twist"". Every game and Dungeon Dash especially offers a whole new and fresh experience. </p>
<p>The board game industry has a huge responsibility of delivering games to the people that bring friends and family together to create memories especially during times of hardship. We feel they have been slacking and the latest games are less than half of what they could be, letting everyone down. We are here to pick up the slack and deliver guaranteed fun to your table. </p>
<p>Dungeon Dash is just a sneak peek of what we have to offer, we range from effortless fun to exciting adventure games that regardless of the length of time, they will have you glued to the edge of your seat the entire time. </p>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>We need $10,000 to accomplish our goal of purchasing enough inventory to kickstart our company and direct to consumer advertising to get this game to every table! </p>
<p>Perks!</p>

<li>$50 - Donation</li>
<li>$30 - Pre-order Dungeon Dash</li>
<li>$100 - Joining our affiliate program</li>

<p>If we don't reach our goal we will still use all the money to purchase inventory to sell and help fund more games till we can afford to buy the games at our targeted low price to be able to maximize profits. Regardless we won't stop till Dungeon Dash is on everyone's table!</p>
<h3>​The Impact</h3>
<p>What we want Dungeon Dash and Knee Slapper Games to bring to the world is to change the way people look at board games. Some too many people don't appreciate board games because there are very few that are the right kind of fun. We want people to undoubtedly want to play our games because of the undeniable fun. </p>
<p>We are a board game company that is for the people, a company that means what they say and produces nothing but board games you didn't know you needed.</p>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Our biggest risk is honestly to not reach our goal because the process will take much longer. The best way to overcome this hurdle would be to: </p>
<ul><li>Start a print and play contest<ul><li>contestants will purchase and print Dungeon Dash, submit a video of them and friends playing on a printable version to enter to win $200 every month.</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>Our biggest challenge is proving to everyone that they should buy Dungeon Dash and that it is different from other games. We will overcome this by:</p>

Risks & Challenges
Our biggest risk is honestly to not reach our goal because the process will take much longer. The best way to overcome this hurdle would be to: 
Start a print and play contestcontestants will purchase and print Dungeon Dash, submit a video of them and friends playing on a printable version to enter to win $200 every month.

Our biggest challenge is proving to everyone that they should buy Dungeon Dash and that it is different from other games. We will overcome this by:
Direct to consumer social media advertising

<p>If the last 18 months have taught us anything, it’s that we need, want, and value human connections like never before. </p>
<p>Being around people and socializing is something we as a society have taken for granted. But then, with the onset of a global pandemic, social distancing, and never-ending lockdowns, everything changed. The pandemic not only affected our confidence, but it had a devastating effect on our mental health.</p>
<p>I wanted to address this dilemma before the world faced a global pandemic of mental illness. I aim to provide people with their very own personal psychotherapist, mentor, or counselor, a practical tool for people to keep close and use whenever needed.</p>
<p><strong>Emotional Collidescope,</strong> The Introspection Deck of cards, is a holistic resource to help support, nurture, and improve mental wellbeing. By harnessing the power of human connections, I hope to foster a safe space to express feelings, thoughts, and emotions.</p>
<p>I drew inspiration for the original concept from Sigmund Freud’s Three Levels of Mind: conscious, preconscious, and subconscious. His theory formed the basis of my in-depth set of questions. </p>
<p>The intentions of these cards are a starting point to take a deep dive into understanding self-awareness, emotional intelligence, and compassionate listening. With 90 cards of introspective questions and <strong>Klecksography</strong> accompanying the deck, this experience allows individuals to immerse themselves in therapeutic artwork to enhance their emotional interpretations. </p>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>With over 20 years in the field, and finding more time this past year to center and focus my attention to long-time dreams, I was able to create this fun and welcoming Tarot deck.</p>
<p>I have been the sole operator of my own online metaphysical business for the last three years. Since crafting shows and many events were canceled over this past year, it had a lot more time to focus on the things that I really wanted to share. I enjoy tarot the most out of my practice and business so I wanted to create a deck that would be great for all levels of readers. It has images friendly enough for very young readers, and is based off of the familiar Rider Waite Smith deck that will familiar to practiced readers. </p>
<p>Being able to publish this deck will certainly help to direct the future of by business and how I hope to do much more in the way of teaching, writing and creating for my field. </p>

<h3>What I Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Let's break this down:</p>
<ul>
<li>I am asking for $13,500 to have this deck printed. I have chosen a wonderful American company to print my deck and booklet.</li>
<li>This is a 78 card complete Tarot deck with guidebook. The cards are a ""standard tarot size"" at 2.78"" x 4.78"". They are made of high quality paper and laminated for protection and durability. They will have a satin gloss finish allowing for an easy shuffle and keeping the integrity of the cards. It is held in a custom 2 part box with ISBN and a bar code for those wishing to purchase wholesale.  </li>
<li>The more you are able to support the more perks you get. I realize that Tarot decks are a very personal thing, so if you wish to support without receiving a deck, I am happy to give you a recorded reading once funding is met. The perks from there only increase with stickers, decks, and matching journals. </li>
<li>This is an all or nothing campaign, so any amount to help reach my goal will be forever appreciated. </li>

<p>At the moment, the only challenges I face are timing and Covid-19.

<h3>The Team</h3>
<p>Creator - My name is Hayley Harper. I'm a writer, entrepreneur and a natural storyteller, and I have always had a love for human psychology. The ultimate question, are murders born or raised? The Curious Crimes game was created out of frustration, I was booked to go onto my very first escape room, for which I was overly excited. A day of puzzle-solving, playing Sherlock. And then the pandemic happened. We went into national lockdown. Escape room cancelled, my heart, broken. So I looked online for something similar, and the choices were, either an expensive 6 part crime that would cost almost $180 to complete or something online where you worked your way around. I couldn't find what I was looking for. So I decided to make my own. I posted it to friends and family and they LOVED it! And so Curious Crimes was born. </p>
<p>Melvyn Goodinson - Graphic Designer and all-round creative wizz. Over 10 years experience working with global companies, recently self employed. Melv discovered his passion for design at an early age, I think he was born with a 2b pencil in his hand. Bringing Melvyn on board was the best decision, he has created something wonderful. </p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<ul>
<li>With people on lockdown around the UK, this is the perfect addition to any weekend night. The does not contain any graphic images, foul language or anything that would upset a child, we make all of our games fun for the whole family. </li>
<li>We are already making great sales on our website, pre-order for our first case, The Case of The Last Birthday is picking up fast!</li>
<li>This entire project came about because we were booked to go to an escape room (I was very excited) and then we went into another national lockdown, the escape room was cancelled. So I decided to write my own and sent it to friends and family, and they loved it.</li>
</ul>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We have spoken with factories, and they have assured us that the preparation we have taken, we are likely to hit those key milestones. </p>
<p> I will communicate any such issues if they arise, along the way. This process should be really straight forward. That said, we are in the unexplored territory with Covid-19, which has already created both production and shipping delays, so we do ask for understanding if necessary.</p>

<p><strong>September- </strong>Campaign Ends, order is placed with our manufacturer in China.</p>
<p><strong>October- </strong>We work with our manufacturer to finalize project specifications.</p>

<h2>Risk and Challenges.</h2>
<p>This is our first card game on Indiegogo. We are diligent with our email responses and work very hard to deliver our product on time. We will do whatever it takes to not disappoint our backers. That said, there are always risks. Gachamo will be our first game manufactured in China. Because of this there is always a possibility that the overseas shipping could be delayed. Rest easy knowing that we will keep all our backers up-to-date with the status of the project every step of the way.</p>
<h2>Special Thanks.</h2>
<p>We are fortunate to have a super supportive circle of friends and family who believe in our venture. This little corner of our Indiegogo is dedicated solely to these great folks! We thank you!</p>

<h3>What is it?</h3>
<p>Counting Sleep is a fast-paced, family-friendly card game where players compete during a charity gaming marathon in order to stay awake the longest. Use cards to boost yourself, hinder your competitors or change the rules completely - but most importantly, <strong>don't pick up the sleep cards!</strong></p>
<p>This campaign has been set up to fund the production of the game and the backer rewards only, and all profit after manufacturing costs will go directly to <a href=""http://www.specialeffect.org.uk"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">SpecialEffect</a>.</p>
<h3>Go on...</h3>
<p>You and your fellow players have decided to participate in a Charity Gaming Marathon, however, you're all vying to steal the glory and be the one who stays awake the longest, leaving your 'team-mates' snoring loudly in their beds. In order to achieve this feat of endurance and emerge victorious, you're going to have to keep yourself awake whilst making everyone else feel sleepy.....veeeery sleeepy.</p>
<p>Using the cards in the deck you can play items on yourself or others to focus on keeping yourself alert, sabotage your competitors or a mix of both. Each time the game changes, the rules do too so be sure to keep an eye on the #NowPlaying deck!</p>
<p>Each turn involves three stages:</p>
<p><strong>1. Deal with any card that has been played in front of you (either by yourself or someone else)</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Draw a card from any available draw piles on the table (there might be more than one!)*</strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Play a card on yourself, someone else or to the discard pile.*</strong></p>
<p>(*You can do step 2 &amp; 3 either way around)</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504535597/ltovvvrxstkiukiewb9f.png"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>Here come's the risky part: each card has a number on the back. This number indicates the likelihood of the card being a Sleep card. If you draw a Sleep card your turn ends and that number gets added to your current hours slept. When all 10 Sleep cards have been drawn, the game ends - turn over your sleep cards and reveal who will take the glory with the least amount of hours slept!</p>
<p>Counting Sleep is suitable for 2 - 10 players of all ages and abilities. Play tactically if you're a strategist, play it safe if you're the cautious type or simply cause as much chaos as you can before the last sleep card is drawn.</p>
<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>We are three avid gamers (video and card) who feel passionately about raising money for SpecialEffect. We are all currently ambassadors for the charity and are part of a team who take part in a 4-day gaming marathon for them every year. </p>
<p>One of us had a great idea for a card game, and decided that they'd like to develop the idea into a product but with all profits going to the charity. From there we have honed the idea to make what we think is a great way to spend an afternoon!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>The minimum amount needed to fund Counting Sleep has been calculated according to the handy pie chart below! We reached this figure by factoring in manufacturing costs (based on minumum order quantities) of the game itself along with the rewards we think you're going to love as well; as making sure that each level leaves us with enough to send a donation to SpecialEffect.</p>
<p>We have also factored in £700 worth of contingency which will go towards any unforeseen costs due to changes in supplier or manufacturing processes beyond our control. Anything left from this contingency will be donated directly to SpecialEffect.</p>
<p style=""text-align: center;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1504904905/rgnicemesrltojxtugxt.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>In exchange for your support in getting this project off the ground you will recieve exclusive backer rewards which we're really very proud of, and hope you'll love as much as we do! Depending on the level you choose to back us at, these include stickers, t-shirts, limited edition nightcaps and your very own 6"" plush Winston the Sheep, who you may recognise from our video above!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>As well as netting you a copy of the game which we have poured our heart and soul into over a period of several years, and any rewards you choose, your contribution will make a difference to people's lives in real-time by allowing us to send money to SpecialEffect. </p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We already have some excellent suppliers lined up to help us out and have prototypes of some of our perks. We are trying to work with ethical and independent suppliers as much as we can, however, we recognise that sometimes life gets in the way of good intentions and occassionally agreed deals fall through. In order to mitigate the impact of this as much as we can, we already have back-up suppliers scoped out and a contingency budget to cover any extra costs we may incur.</p>
<p>There are minimum order quantities for various items we will be including in this campaign, and there is a risk we will not raise enough in order to meet those quantities. In order to avoid this happening, we have chosen to use the fixed funding model for this campaign, which means that if we do not reach the minumum amount outlined above, the campaign will not go ahead and no one will be charged.</p>
<p>Being a team of three, we realise that we're only small, but we are also mighty! In the event that one of us is unable to continue to commit to the project, we feel that the remaining members are well equipped enough to continue with minimal disruption by making the whole team aware of all the moving parts involved in the process, and giving them access to any online accounts that are required.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>We understand that times are hard, and you may be unable to contribute your money to this campaign - however, if you feel you'd still like to help you can do so by shouting about us from the rooftops!* </p>
<p>Every share on social media means the world to us and only takes a few seconds. There are even social media sharing buttons at the top of this page which will do all the heavy lifting for you.</p>
<p>If you are an event organiser and feel that you would like to offer us some space at your event to demonstrate Counting Sleep, a supplier who thinks they can offer us a deal we can't refuse, or if you feel you can help us out in any other way please feel free to get in touch with us by emailing <strong>info@countingsleepgame.co.uk</strong></p>

Back in the early 1990’s, I was first introduced to our favourite fantasy football game; back when the internet, mobile phones, and plastic miniatures where a thing of the future. When, therefore, I was lucky enough to save up enough pocket money or pester my parents hard enough, I would be able to buy a new shiny metal team to play badly with my friends. </p><p>These days, most miniatures are plastic or resin, and I’m totally fine with this. The details, and the ability to convert and kitbash these miniatures is fantastic. But a part of me longs for the cool and weighty feel of a metal miniature and the small chance of lead poisoning from licking too many paint brushes!</p><p>It is this longing for a weighty feel to my modern miniatures which has driven me to design and develop this new and unique project. Not only do these products produce a satisfying weighty feel, they also give a premium look to one of the most overlooked aspects of finishing your miniatures. Read on to find out more about this project, I hope you like it.</p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607522729/no7amq4qfg1hbs5jj9hh.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p>These heavy metal bases give you total customisation control over your order. Ordered as Race Specific Perks you can specify three main areas of choice:</p><p><strong>1. Base Finish.</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620936456/qob1hbqj9cfvmlzgdwbj.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>These metal bases come in six distinct finishes. Antique Silver, Antique Bronze, Antique Gold, Metallic Black, Classic Black and Shiny Gold. Antique Silver, Antique Bronze, and Antique Gold give an old and used feel and, because they are quite natural in colour, they can really help your miniatures stand out. Classic Black is a deep black with a satin finish, not too glossy and not to matte. This variant gives a very familiar feel to those of us who like to finish our miniatures with the classic black base; simple and elegant. Metallic Black is a high gloss variant and looks to be a more of a very dark grey, almost like a gun metal and gives a very 'Beskar' feel.</p><p><strong>2. Colour Rings.</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1618826078/beucln6002glgx4bafye.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>In addition to the finish of the metal, you can also choose (or not) to install a single colour ring into each base. This ring is designed to do one of two things:</p><ol>
<li>Identify the ‘positional’ aspect of your miniature. It’s a popular way to help identify your miniatures while in play, such as red of blitzer, yellow for catcher and so on.</li>
<li>If you are not interested in highlighting the positional nature of your miniature, then perhaps pick a colour that matches your teams kit colour, to really give it a premium and finished look. Perhaps you don’t want any colours at all? This is not a problem, simply select ‘none’ and you’ll receive yours without colour.</li>
</ol><p><strong>3. Base Sizes and Details.</strong></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620936489/sfaj5pbpfpyu7xqsexcq.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>The three types of bases available are designed for 25mm, 32mm and 40mm miniatures. On the underside of each base is an indicator for prone and stunned statuses. When you install your miniature to the base, you can set it up to help indicate the status of the miniature when placed down on the pitch.</p><p> Another perk of using these metal bases is that top heavy miniatures that are prone to falling over are now less likely to do so.</p><p>The 25mm and 32mm base also fit perfectly with my previous Ball Carrier Tokens.</p><p>Star Player packs come with a choice of size for each base. The team packs come with choices of base size for miniatures that I believe need a choice; 'big guy' positions for example.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1608645232/utbempeyfsyftv9jsgxw.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Detailed below are some example setups I have made to give you an overview of the possibilities available. As mentioned previously, you can customise your order to the exact personal requirements. Either using the colour rings to denote positions of the players, or perhaps to highlight a colour that is already used in the paint job you have, or plan to produce for your team. You can also opt to order your bases without any colour fill at all - the choice is yours every step of the way.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1620936530/d8xwoejz9gyyhvjgshqt.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p> </p><p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1607529477/dzi2zxp2vhcdbakjt9st.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p><p>Like most things in this hobby of ours, there are many ways to achieve what we want. Some of you may want to retrofit/upgrade these bases into your existing miniatures, and some will build a new team with these in mind. I plan to produce a set of detailed instructions (and perhaps videos) for you all as part of each pledge. A printed booklet maybe? Below is a very brief overview of how you might want to install these bases.</p><p><strong>New Team Installation</strong></p><p>Installing these metal bases to a new team presents multiple ways of achieving the same result. This way probably depends more on what you are used to doing with your miniatures than anything else.</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Pre Painting. This way involves attaching the miniature to the base before painting it. This gives you an opportunity to create a good solid bond and allows you to add basing materials, such as sand, to create mud etc. To keep the base clear of any paint during the painting process I would highly recommend masking off the base with masking tape, or whatever your preferred method.</p><p><strong>2. </strong>After Painting. This way you would paint your miniature before installing it to the base. This way means no need to mask off the base, like the above option recommends. Once the miniature is installed you would then just need to finish the basing by gluing in the sand and static grass etc.</p><p>All the metal bases have a recessed area (0.75mm) across the top of the base, by design. This creates a barrier so that, when you are applying the glue for the sand and static grass, it stops it from overflowing into the positional colour ring area. It also means that the miniature has an area for the feet to grab onto because this area has a sandblasted texture. Glues love these areas and it helps produce a very tight bond.</p><p>You can also choose to install the base with edge-to-edge basing. See the picture above to see how this works. It will give you that classic look that we are all used to.</p><p><strong>Retro Installation</strong></p><p>Carefully clipping out your old base, you can then clean up their feet to create a new surface for gluing. I recommend you scuff the base of the feet to help create a good bonding surface. Once you have freed your miniature from your old base you can do one of two things: </p><p><strong>1. </strong>Glue the miniature to the new base <strong>(taking care to line-up for Prone/Stunned)</strong> and then add the basing details after, such as mud/sand and static grass etc.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Produce your base first, so before you stick the miniature to the base, you can glue in the sand and static grass. Once this is done, you simply glue the miniature as the last step.</p><p>During the testing on the prototypes I produced, I found that <strong>option 1</strong> works really well. You have a clean metal surface for your glue to take a good hold of your miniature. I then filled the textured basing area with glue, then poured over the sand to create the mud texture. This gave me lots of control and make the miniature sit perfectly and formed a very strong bond. Then it was just a case of waiting for it to dry, and then finishing the base painting as you would any other miniature. </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1610454247/imtaeipzsd2t3ebv7c4r.jpg"" src=""""/></p><p>Once you have selected and customised your first base pack from the homepage, you then have the option to not only include some of the amazing previous products you'll see below, but also to include additional base packs at a <strong>discounted price</strong>.

Moreover, with its cunningly designed shape, it fits snugly into the most crowded of cages or scraps. If the ball is loose on the pitch, simply flip the token to indicate it's up for grabs.

It’s through Charlie Victor that I engage with the local, domestic and international tabletop Fantasy Football family and the wargaming community. Everything I make is for the fans of the game we play; nothing gives me greater pleasure than seeing my products on the pitch and across the table.</p><p>I’m 41, a self-employed designer with 23+ years of design industry experience, living in Leicester, UK with my wife, Elen, and our two young children, Sasha and Nikita. I love to eat good food, watch good films, see good friends, and roll terrible sequences of dice.</p><p>In 2015 I founded the Leicester Blood Bowl League (LBBL) and served proudly as Commissioner for five seasons. Like Charlie Victor itself, it was born from a desire to bring together like-minded folk and make the hobby bigger, better and bloodier! After handing over the reins in 2018, Charlie Victor has launched four successful Indiegogo campaigns and firmly established itself within the Fantasy Football community.</p><p>One of the highlights of the LBBL was designing high-quality ‘loot’ for each coach completing a season: from dice to dog tags, poker chips to bribe coins. As with every Charlie Victor product, the quality, playability, and desirability of these items was paramount, and they quickly became both club favourites and highly sought after by collectors.</p><p>Ultimately, I just love to design cool, and I want the whole hobby to be enhanced as a, my goals remain the same: to have fun, make cool stuff, and grow the hobby.</p><p>As a design fanatic, I like to think I have a feel for what good design should look like and how it should perform.

Apologies for any inconvenience these issues have caused, i'm just as frustrated by them. Cheers, Duncan.I’m old school, and I’m happy to admit this. Back in the early 1990’s, I was first introduced to our favourite fantasy football game; back when the internet, mobile phones, and plastic miniatures where a thing of the future. When, therefore, I was lucky enough to save up enough pocket money or pester my parents hard enough, I would be able to buy a new shiny metal team to play badly with my friends. These days, most miniatures are plastic or resin, and I’m totally fine with this. The details, and the ability to convert and kitbash these miniatures is fantastic. But a part of me longs for the cool and weighty feel of a metal miniature and the small chance of lead poisoning from licking too many paint brushes!It is this longing for a weighty feel to my modern miniatures which has driven me to design and develop this new and unique project. Not only do these products produce a satisfying weighty feel, they also give a premium look to one of the most overlooked aspects of finishing your miniatures. Read on to find out more about this project, I hope you like it.These heavy metal bases give you total customisation control over your order. Ordered as Race Specific Perks you can specify three main areas of choice:1. Base Finish.These metal bases come in six distinct finishes. Antique Silver, Antique Bronze, Antique Gold, Metallic Black, Classic Black and Shiny Gold. Antique Silver, Antique Bronze, and Antique Gold give an old and used feel and, because they are quite natural in colour, they can really help your miniatures stand out. Classic Black is a deep black with a satin finish, not too glossy and not to matte. This variant gives a very familiar feel to those of us who like to finish our miniatures with the classic black base; simple and elegant. Metallic Black is a high gloss variant and looks to be a more of a very dark grey, almost like a gun metal and gives a very 'Beskar' feel.2. Colour Rings.In addition to the finish of the metal, you can also choose (or not) to install a single colour ring into each base. This ring is designed to do one of two things:
Identify the ‘positional’ aspect of your miniature. It’s a popular way to help identify your miniatures while in play, such as red of blitzer, yellow for catcher and so on.
If you are not interested in highlighting the positional nature of your miniature, then perhaps pick a colour that matches your teams kit colour, to really give it a premium and finished look. Perhaps you don’t want any colours at all? This is not a problem, simply select ‘none’ and you’ll receive yours without colour.
3. Base Sizes and Details.The three types of bases available are designed for 25mm, 32mm and 40mm miniatures. On the underside of each base is an indicator for prone and stunned statuses. When you install your miniature to the base, you can set it up to help indicate the status of the miniature when placed down on the pitch. Another perk of using these metal bases is that top heavy miniatures that are prone to falling over are now less likely to do so.The 25mm and 32mm base also fit perfectly with my previous Ball Carrier Tokens.Star Player packs come with a choice of size for each base. The team packs come with choices of base size for miniatures that I believe need a choice; 'big guy' positions for example.Detailed below are some example setups I have made to give you an overview of the possibilities available. As mentioned previously, you can customise your order to the exact personal requirements. Either using the colour rings to denote positions of the players, or perhaps to highlight a colour that is already used in the paint job you have, or plan to produce for your team. You can also opt to order your bases without any colour fill at all - the choice is yours every step of the way. Like most things in this hobby of ours, there are many ways to achieve what we want. Some of you may want to retrofit/upgrade these bases into your existing miniatures, and some will build a new team with these in mind. I plan to produce a set of detailed instructions (and perhaps videos) for you all as part of each pledge. A printed booklet maybe? Below is a very brief overview of how you might want to install these bases.New Team InstallationInstalling these metal bases to a new team presents multiple ways of achieving the same result. This way probably depends more on what you are used to doing with your miniatures than anything else.1. Pre Painting. This way involves attaching the miniature to the base before painting it. This gives you an opportunity to create a good solid bond and allows you to add basing materials, such as sand, to create mud etc. To keep the base clear of any paint during the painting process I would highly recommend masking off the base with masking tape, or whatever your preferred method.2. After Painting. This way you would paint your miniature before installing it to the base. This way means no need to mask off the base, like the above option recommends. Once the miniature is installed you would then just need to finish the basing by gluing in the sand and static grass etc.All the metal bases have a recessed area (0.75mm) across the top of the base, by design. This creates a barrier so that, when you are applying the glue for the sand and static grass, it stops it from overflowing into the positional colour ring area. It also means that the miniature has an area for the feet to grab onto because this area has a sandblasted texture. Glues love these areas and it helps produce a very tight bond.You can also choose to install the base with edge-to-edge basing. See the picture above to see how this works. It will give you that classic look that we are all used to.Retro InstallationCarefully clipping out your old base, you can then clean up their feet to create a new surface for gluing. I recommend you scuff the base of the feet to help create a good bonding surface. Once you have freed your miniature from your old base you can do one of two things: 1. Glue the miniature to the new base (taking care to line-up for Prone/Stunned) and then add the basing details after, such as mud/sand and static grass etc.2. Produce your base first, so before you stick the miniature to the base, you can glue in the sand and static grass. Once this is done, you simply glue the miniature as the last step.During the testing on the prototypes I produced, I found that option 1 works really well. You have a clean metal surface for your glue to take a good hold of your miniature. I then filled the textured basing area with glue, then poured over the sand to create the mud texture. This gave me lots of control and make the miniature sit perfectly and formed a very strong bond. Then it was just a case of waiting for it to dry, and then finishing the base painting as you would any other miniature. Once you have selected and customised your first base pack from the homepage, you then have the option to not only include some of the amazing previous products you'll see below, but also to include additional base packs at a discounted price. All team races are available and include the ability to customise them to your own personal preference. All additional add ons do not incur any additional shipping costs; a great opportunity to make huge savings!Add-on perks can be purchased at the checkout when you complete your order. They do not require any additional shipping costs (apart from Human Team Tokens, Space Hulk and Hero Quest) and are highly discounted; a perfect time to make savings and pickup items you may have missed out on previously.The ball. For some of us it’s the be-all and end-all of the game. For others it simply gets in the way of a good punch-up. Nevertheless, it’s important that we know where the ball is at any given point in the match. This token has been designed to fit easily around your player's base, be that 25mm or 32mm in size. Moreover, with its cunningly designed shape, it fits snugly into the most crowded of cages or scraps. If the ball is loose on the pitch, simply flip the token to indicate it's up for grabs. Never again will you forget who’s holding the ball (and scrag them).Produced in a Metallic Black finish with punchy enamel fill colours for clarity and is compatible with both 32mm and 25mm miniature bases and has a built in scatter template.Bribery! Such a wonderful thing. If you have deep enough pockets you can really gain an advantage with these. Foul to your heart's content safe in the knowledge that you can just pay off the referee should they have the temerity to try to enforce the rules.Be careful though as referees can be greedy, and you may need more than one to convince them to look the other way. So spend these valuable coins wisely.You can track your spending by turning each one over after use. The bloody tears on the reverse side of each coin will be a dead giveaway as to its status.Try not to roll too many ones…Produced in antique gold plating and coloured enamel.Nobody, and I mean NOBODY, bribes as hard as goblins do. They are masters at it. Which is just as well as they're terrible at everything else! They work hard to subvert the rules, so much so that the little buggers stole the original bribe coin die stamps and produced their own versions, with some very dubious amendments! They have even tried to dodge showing if they have used them at all - very sneaky stuff - the gits!Never fear though, because the bloody tears reverse side always gives away the status of the bribe.Produced in antique bronze plating and coloured enamel.A beautiful translucent D16 in blood red with white infill colour icons, and a 16mm D6 in bright white with blood red colour infill. This D16 is a custom-made dice, and the icons will be part of the dice mould. This means no laser engraving is required; just crystal-clear designs with solid colour fill.The dice that started it all! Now referred to as Legacy Casualty Dice and can be used with all rules prior to the 2020 release. Two dice, one 6-sided engraved 16mm opaque white die and the other an 8-sided engraved red die. The dice design shows clearly what the result is. No fumbling about getting the two numbers mixed up etc. The dice show you the result instantly. Should you require more information detailing the seriousness of the injury, you will be able to reference the handy, high quality reference card included with each set of dice.Being the coach of a fantasy football team is a difficult and frequently violently curtailed career choice. Some are better than others at dealing with the stresses of coaching a team, prowling the sidelines, barking orders and questioning the calls and parentage of the referee. Sometimes they go a little too far…Assuming all is well, this coach coin shows your head coach where they belong; in the dugout. Should they go too far and have to be removed from the game just for politely suggesting at knifepoint that the ref lets their poor little chainsaw back on the pitch then simply turn this coin over to show your coach has left the dugout.With any luck, they'll recover from their 'security escort' in time for the next match…Produced in antique silver plating and coloured enamel.Every game of fantasy football starts with a kick-off. The referee flips the coin after a coach has picked a side. Heads or Tentacles? There are even myths about coaches rolling dice to see who kicks and receives.Well, no more! I’m very proud of this coin, confident that it is at least the equal of any fantasy football community produced coin in existence. A quality item for a momentous choice - kick or receive?Produced in antique silver plating.HOW TO ORDER THESE NEGATRAIT BANDS AS PART OF YOUR PLEDGE:1.

It’s through Charlie Victor that I engage with the local, domestic and international tabletop Fantasy Football family and the wargaming community. Everything I make is for the fans of the game we play; nothing gives me greater pleasure than seeing my products on the pitch and across the table.I’m 41, a self-employed designer with 23+ years of design industry experience, living in Leicester, UK with my wife, Elen, and our two young children, Sasha and Nikita. I love to eat good food, watch good films, see good friends, and roll terrible sequences of dice.In 2015 I founded the Leicester Blood Bowl League (LBBL) and served proudly as Commissioner for five seasons. Like Charlie Victor itself, it was born from a desire to bring together like-minded folk and make the hobby bigger, better and bloodier! After handing over the reins in 2018, Charlie Victor has launched four successful Indiegogo campaigns and firmly established itself within the Fantasy Football community.One of the highlights of the LBBL was designing high-quality ‘loot’ for each coach completing a season: from dice to dog tags, poker chips to bribe coins. As with every Charlie Victor product, the quality, playability, and desirability of these items was paramount, and they quickly became both club favourites and highly sought after by collectors.Ultimately, I just love to design cool, and I want the whole hobby to be enhanced as a, my goals remain the same: to have fun, make cool stuff, and grow the hobby.As a design fanatic, I like to think I have a feel for what good design should look like and how it should perform. This led me to launch my first Indiegogo campaign for my Casualty Dice which successfully funded in under 24hrs and went on to raise 946% of the original goal. Click the image to see the full details on its project page:My next crowdfunded project was the highly successful Coins of Corruption. This project celebrated the darker side of the game of fantasy football, funding was achieved in under just 2hrs and went on to raise £8,965.00 - 326% of its original goal. To say I was pleased with how the community responded to this untested concept would be a huge understatement and I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who backed the project, including those who purchased the limited remaining items after the project had been delivered to backers. Click the image to see the full details on its project page:My third crowdfunded project was the most successful to date - Human Team Tokens. The aim of that campaign was to produce stunning and unique items for human teams found in the fantasy football universe. Funding was achieved in under only 7 minutes and went on to raise £16,007 - 400% of its original goal and unlocking every stretch goal. As with all of my projects to date, they are untested concepts within the community, and I was incredibly humbled that so many backers came forward to help me fund the vision and concept of race specific team tokens. More of these team tokens will be launched in future, so please keep your eyes peeled for it!My fourth project was a direct result of new rules coming into the community and required a complete redesign of the Casualty Dice. Switching from a D6/D8 to a D6/D16 was a big jump and the community came forward to help me launch this Indiegogo campaign for my Casualty Dice 2020, which successfully funded in under only 20 minutes and went on to raise £7,055 - 587% of it's original goal. Click the image to see the full details on its project page:I just love to design cool stuff, no matter how small or large the idea. I get a real kick out of seeing people using products I have created, and this is where I hope you, the community can come in and help my vision for this metal base system to become a reality.If you have backed any of my projects previously you will know that I’m fanatical about only producing premium quality items. This is reflected in what you received as a backer, and that quality WILL be provided again in this, and future Charlie Victor projects.This project does not aim to break any technological bounds, nor does it pretend to be anything other than an opportunity for me to bring my design ideas to life, and for you in the community to have fun with them. It’s in my nature to share and I very much want to share this with you.I’m deliberately using die casting and enamels because, despite it being more expensive, it’s by far the best quality finish and has an increased longevity over any other type of production process.I’d like to be honest and upfront that there ‘may’ be changes to items in the campaign after it’s finished. This will ONLY ever be for improving the design and atheistic, never to make anything cheaper or easier for me. If you know me well enough you will know I’m a bit of a fanatic and I’m only interested in making the items the best they can be. I hope you can put your trust in me to deliver the very best items and come aboard and back the campaign and make it a reality.Please also refer to the FAQs for this campaign. I have filled it with typical questions and answers, some of which may answer your queries. If you have a question not covered by the FAQs, don’t hesitate to get in touch as I’ll be happy to help you.I like to think I’m a trusted member of the fantasy football community and I value that trust immensely. I responsibly managed the finances of the previous campaigns I produced and delivered to thousands of backers around the world. I have produced these types of products in the past, so I’m very confident in completing this campaign to the high standard you’ve come to expect from me and my brand. I think the point I’m trying to make is you can trust in me to deliver this project to you; my reputation depends on it.There aren’t any challenges that haven’t already been overcome. I have the production moulds completed, and I’m using a trusted supplier that can produce the quantities I need. I’ve completed these projects previously and understand the challenges of shipping products across the world. I’m 100% confident that I’m equipped to deliver this project. I aim to start shipping to backers in September 2021, or earlier if possible.Please consider backing this campaign and if you do choose to do so, please also consider spreading the word to as many people as you can – this is critical to a successful campaign. After previous campaigns have closed, I had many people message me wanting to purchase the campaign's perks. It’s great to have these people come forward, but even better if they back the campaign in the first instance as this helps unlock more stretch goals. If, however, you choose not to back this campaign then please feel free to let me know why. Feedback, good or bad, is important to me. This support would be very much appreciated and could make all the difference in the future.Thank you for taking the time to read my campaign, and I hope you choose to help me succeed in this passion project of mine. Should you have any questions please do not hesitate to ask; I'll be ready and waiting to answer them.Cheers!Duncan",39.0,0,"5 Campaigns

Good luck with any of those.If you back this project you will help create a landmark book and setting, as grand as any mega-dungeon or city-state that has come before, but with a dark and foreboding edge of grimdark survival horror.What We Need & What You GetThe book is already over half-written, with the general shape of the city spelt out and many of its locations already described.What we need at this point is time, time to devote fully to finishing the book, commissioning extra art and cartography and running through editing and other passes to polish up the book as a whole.
£3,000 to cover previous work paid for and to cover the time spent to finish development.
Any further funds to go towards additional art and cartography.
Even if I don't reach my final goal, what funds are contributed will ensure a final product is produced, just not with the same amount of time or quality devoted to it as I would prefer.
Stretch goals will provide additional conversions of monsters and non-player-characters for additional systems such as Lamentations of the Flame Princess and Mork Borg. The base book will have rules for 5e D&D and my 'Grimdark' rules-set for the same.Other stretch goals might include handouts, adventures, free Postmortem Studios material and more.The ImpactThis is, I think, a landmark project with an unprecedented level of detail to it. A landmark in more than one way, I think it will influence other settings and campaign books in the future, and you can be a part of it.I have crowdfunded several projects in the past:
A regular scholarship program for underprivileged artists.
A history book.
Three RPG games.
I always deliver, even when problems arise and projects are delayed, with good communication and compensation where I feel it's necessary.I want your help to add another, major, successful project to the list.Risks & ChallengesNo project is without risk, and we're not a large company. We've definitely had some issues with projects in the past, but we've always pulled through it to provide a product.I do suffer from severe clinical depression, which comes and goes in severity, but can make my capacity for work severely lessened. I have factored this in, giving myself enough time to deliver, regardless.I do have existing commitments that also eat into my time, running paid, streamed games online regularly. August is relatively free of that commitment and again has been factored in. I have cleared my desk of virtually all interruptions from this project (another reason I need the money to pay for the gap in production).I have, in the past, had problems with bottlenecks from using a single artist, writer or other assistant professionals. This time I have been sure to include a variety of artists in the project, and the majority of the artwork is already complete.Other Ways You Can HelpIf you can't contribute, you can always share the project on social media, mention it in your videos or invite me onto your channel or podcast to help me promote the crowdfunder and talk about the project itself. Whatever I can do to help you help me, let me know.",2.0,0,"11 Campaigns

<p>Within this book you will also find a details of the state of the great magickal powers in this era: the Order of Reason, preparing for their metamorphosis into the Technocratic Union and riding upon the great beast of Empire; the Council of Nine, now merely eight, caught in infighting and looking for a new peer; and the Crafts, the manifold practices of magick across the world, who fight to save their peoples from conquest and exploitation.</p>

<p>In addition, <strong>Victorian Mage</strong> includes an examination of life as a magus in the stratified society of Imperial Britain and the wider empire; rules reflecting the difference in how magick works during this age, when the Consensus of the Technocracy has yet to enfold the globe; and a gazetteer of the Victorian world, touching on cultures and conflicts across the globe as empires struggle for dominance and the masses struggle simply to survive.</p>

<p>After that primary goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of this Victorian world, possibly expanding into Storyteller and player tools and accessories, as well as a possible rules companion. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we can use to explore these scenarios and challenges.</p>
<p>Beyond those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done — build a community invested in each other's stories and shared imaginations. Every person who participates is joining with the goal of bringing this game into the world, and that common goal is a magickal binding element that we can't help but want to share. When you back this project, you join us on this journey and become part of our own secret cabal.</p>

<p>All participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. Once the campaign meets the funding target, then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your contribution will only be kept if we achieve our funding target.</p>
<p>In thanks for your support, we offer perks based on your level of funding pledged. The Perk descriptions outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that perks including the deluxe hardcover may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.</p>
<p>This Indiegogo campaign builds upon three core Perks:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<strong>Supporter</strong> - Choose this Perk if you want to support the campaign, but aren't interested in either the PDF or deluxe hardcover version of Victorian Mage at this time. You can select Add On perks with this reward, and you'll have full access to the post-campaign Pledge Manager, should you wish to update your options in the future.</li>
<li>
<strong>Victorian Mage PDF</strong> - Choose this Perk if you're staying digital - either saving trees or saving shelf space. This Perk is built around the <strong>Victorian Mage</strong> PDF, and you can select any Add On perks and have full access to the post-campaign Pledge Manager.</li>
<li>
<strong>Victorian Mage Deluxe Hardcover</strong> - Choose this Perk if you're interested in the limited edition Deluxe Hardcover version of this book. This Perk also includes the PDF version, and you can select any additional Add On perks and will have full access to the post-campaign Pledge Manager.</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don’t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this Victorian Mage campaign, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Qualified Retailers can contact <u>theonyxpath@gmail.com</u> to confirm your retailer status and gain access to this special Retailer Perk to get 5 copies of the Deluxe Hardcover book and Storyteller Reference Screen at a retail-specific discount to sell in-store.</p>

<p><strong>VICTORIAN MAGE PDF VERSION</strong> - The digital version of <strong>Victorian Mage</strong>, fulfilled by our partners at DriveThruRPG.com. Indiegogo contributors will receive a redemption link for an early version, before it goes on sale to the public. This initial ""Backer Version"" will be used to get feedback from the fans to make the final version the best that it can be. When it has been updated to the final version, it will be automatically added to your DriveThruRPG library and available for download at your convenience.</p>
<p><strong>VICTORIAN MAGE </strong><strong>DELUXE HARDCOVER VERSION</strong> - The main goal of this campaign is to fund the creation, production, and print run of a beautiful deluxe edition of the game. Note that all Perks that include the Hardcover version also include the PDF version as a bonus. Additional shipping charges are automatically added to your pledge by Indiegogo, based on your delivery location.</p>
<p><strong>MANUSCRIPT PREVIEW E-MAILS</strong> – Every Wednesday during the course of the campaign, we will be e-mailing all contributors a link to download a preview of the current draft manuscript. We'll be sending these out in sections, but by the end of the project, contributors will be able to read the ENTIRE current manuscript for <strong>Victorian Mage</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>DISCOUNTED PRINT-ON-DEMAND OPTION</strong> –  For <strong>Victorian Mage</strong>, you will have the option of using DriveThruRPG.com’s Print-On-Demand service to purchase a physical, printed copy directly from their PoD partners at a discounted rate (this cost is <u>not</u> included in your pledge, and you do not need to increase the cost of your contribution to use this option). When the PoD versions are available to order (which will be some time after the book has gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the book from DriveThruRPG.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your Perk rewards.</p>

<p>As we increase the overall funding and support for the project, we’re able to add additional resources to the project, expand the rewards listed, and add in new offers and opportunities. Each Stretch Goal will have a target that, once reached, will add or expand upon a supplemental project. We will continue to build on this list when we achieve these targets during the campaign. Whenever we achieve a stretch goal, the image will be updated to reflect the achievement.</p>
<p>In addition, any funds generated in our Pledge Manager until May 24, 2021 will be included in the Stretch Goal Funding Target total, so some Stretch Goals could be unlocked after this campaign concludes!

<p>When you pledge to a reward tier that includes the <strong>Victorian Mage</strong> deluxe hardcover edition, Indiegogo will automatically calculate additional shipping costs based on your location.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, international shipping has become increasing expensive and is often prohibitive to non-US backers. Several contemporary publishers have decided to discontinue international shipping completely. For this project, Onyx Path wants to keep all options open to our customers, though shipping costs will reflect the expense. Please be aware that you are responsible for additional import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.</p>
<p>If you live outside of the US, here are your options for obtaining a physical copy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pledge to the campaign at $35+ contribution tier to get have the discounted print-on-demand redemption link included as part of your Perks. (see Reward Descriptions, above, for more details).</li>
<li>Though the deluxe edition will be printed in limited quantities, any excess stock from the print run will possibly be made available through re-sellers online. You can wait and see if it's possible to purchase at that time.</li>
<li>Pledge to the campaign at the $5 Supporter tier to get included in the manuscript preview e-mail list. Later, you can buy the PDF and/or Print-on-Demand when eventually released.</li>
<li>Contact your local game store and encourage them to back at the the Retailer Tier for this campaign, and then make sure you're put on a preorder list!</li>
<li>Look into a freight forwarding service that can give you a US-based shipping address, get packages delivered to it, and then forwarded to you.</li>
<li>If you don’t mind the high shipping costs, pledge to the appropriate reward tier and pay for shipping now! We'll send your package at the same time we fulfill domestic rewards.</li>
</ul>

<p>After the campaign is over we'll launch BackerKit, our post-campaign pledge manager, and invite the contributors to confirm their perks via survey. This allows you to confirm your perks and add on anything that you might have missed, as well as possibly increasing your pledged reward tier, should you choose to expand your perk selection. This option will give international backers additional time to investigate shipping options, should they choose, knowing they can confirm a physical reward at a later date. Funding collected in BackerKit after the campaign <u>WILL</u> count toward any announced campaign Stretch Goals!.</p>

<p><strong>Risk</strong>: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: We have successfully shipped many crowdfunded projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each campaign. The text for Victorian Mage is finished and some initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.</p>
<p><strong>Risk</strong>: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: Shipping costs have continued to rise over the past few years, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to increase the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.</p>
<p><strong>Risk</strong>: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong>: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous crowdfunding campaigns and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several projects months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards on schedule. That being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Indiegogo as well as in our regular weekly Monday Meeting Notes blog at <a href=""http://www.theonyxpath.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.theonyxpath.com</a></p>
<p><strong>ADDITIONAL TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS</strong></p>
<p>By backing this Indiegogo project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:</p>
<p>ARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL &amp; CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.</p>
<p>REWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.</p>
<p>ADDRESS CONFIRMATION &amp; DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Indiegogo and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we’ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.</p>
<p>DIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements. If you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.</p>

The Order of Reason spreads its wings, and the world burns.
We tell ourselves this is for Enlightenment. We tell ourselves this is for the greater good. We tell ourselves this is for humanity.
We lie to ourselves.
The great engines of the Empire are all-consuming beasts, heedless of anything but their own hunger — for riches, for lives, for land. Everything falls before their advance. Nations are ground to dust. Histories torn apart and set aflame. Treasures seized and their secrets plundered.
We will chain the world and all its magickal wonders.
Who will stop us?

 
Victorian Mage provides advice and material for running your Mage: The Ascension 20th Anniversary Edition chronicles amid the tumult of the Victorian era, as the Order of Reason rises to power and the Traditions falter.

Within this book you will also find a details of the state of the great magickal powers in this era: the Order of Reason, preparing for their metamorphosis into the Technocratic Union and riding upon the great beast of Empire; the Council of Nine, now merely eight, caught in infighting and looking for a new peer; and the Crafts, the manifold practices of magick across the world, who fight to save their peoples from conquest and exploitation.

In addition, Victorian Mage includes an examination of life as a magus in the stratified society of Imperial Britain and the wider empire; rules reflecting the difference in how magick works during this age, when the Consensus of the Technocracy has yet to enfold the globe; and a gazetteer of the Victorian world, touching on cultures and conflicts across the globe as empires struggle for dominance and the masses struggle simply to survive.

 

This Victorian Mage Indiegogo campaign is designed to enable us to create a deluxe hardcover edition of this supplement, designed to match the look and feel of our other 20th Anniversary Editions, and specifically the Mage: The Ascension 20th Anniversary Edition. 
We want to create a deluxe edition with a leatherette-style cover featuring the title of the book on the spine, 200+ full color interior pages, and a silk ribbon bookmark. The cover will featured an embossed image of the Victorian Mage logo. Exceptional funding will allow us to further develop the setting and provide additional materials for play.

The Mage: The Ascension 20th Anniversary rulebook is required to make full use of the rules and options presented in Victorian Mage.


The manuscript is written, awesome artists are being contracted, and layout templates are being built. An amazing digital PDF product will be created with this material. With your help we will be able to take it a step further and produce a deluxe hardcover version of Victorian Mage for Mage 20 fans and collectors. The main goal and primary focus of this Indiegogo campaign is the creation of this limited-edition book.
After that primary goal, we hope to gain additional funding to explore more of this Victorian world, possibly expanding into Storyteller and player tools and accessories, as well as a possible rules companion. The greater our funding for this project, the more resources we can use to explore these scenarios and challenges.
Beyond those campaign-specific goals, we hope to do what our games have always done — build a community invested in each other's stories and shared imaginations. Every person who participates is joining with the goal of bringing this game into the world, and that common goal is a magickal binding element that we can't help but want to share. When you back this project, you join us on this journey and become part of our own secret cabal.


All participants who would like to make this project happen can pledge their support and add to the overall campaign total. Once the campaign meets the funding target, then we will have funded the project and it will become a reality. Your contribution will only be kept if we achieve our funding target.
In thanks for your support, we offer perks based on your level of funding pledged. The Perk descriptions outline the various rewards reflecting various levels of support pledged. Please note that perks including the deluxe hardcover may automatically add additional charges to cover shipping expenses.
This Indiegogo campaign builds upon three core Perks:


Supporter - Choose this Perk if you want to support the campaign, but aren't interested in either the PDF or deluxe hardcover version of Victorian Mage at this time. You can select Add On perks with this reward, and you'll have full access to the post-campaign Pledge Manager, should you wish to update your options in the future.

Victorian Mage PDF - Choose this Perk if you're staying digital - either saving trees or saving shelf space. This Perk is built around the Victorian Mage PDF, and you can select any Add On perks and have full access to the post-campaign Pledge Manager.

Victorian Mage Deluxe Hardcover - Choose this Perk if you're interested in the limited edition Deluxe Hardcover version of this book. This Perk also includes the PDF version, and you can select any additional Add On perks and will have full access to the post-campaign Pledge Manager.

Also, we love retailers, but modern publishing methods don’t always make it easy for them to get books into their stores. With this Victorian Mage campaign, we have created a special Reward Tier just for you. Qualified Retailers can contact theonyxpath@gmail.com to confirm your retailer status and gain access to this special Retailer Perk to get 5 copies of the Deluxe Hardcover book and Storyteller Reference Screen at a retail-specific discount to sell in-store.


VICTORIAN MAGE PDF VERSION - The digital version of Victorian Mage, fulfilled by our partners at DriveThruRPG.com. Indiegogo contributors will receive a redemption link for an early version, before it goes on sale to the public. This initial ""Backer Version"" will be used to get feedback from the fans to make the final version the best that it can be. When it has been updated to the final version, it will be automatically added to your DriveThruRPG library and available for download at your convenience.
VICTORIAN MAGE DELUXE HARDCOVER VERSION - The main goal of this campaign is to fund the creation, production, and print run of a beautiful deluxe edition of the game. Note that all Perks that include the Hardcover version also include the PDF version as a bonus. Additional shipping charges are automatically added to your pledge by Indiegogo, based on your delivery location.
MANUSCRIPT PREVIEW E-MAILS – Every Wednesday during the course of the campaign, we will be e-mailing all contributors a link to download a preview of the current draft manuscript. We'll be sending these out in sections, but by the end of the project, contributors will be able to read the ENTIRE current manuscript for Victorian Mage. 
DISCOUNTED PRINT-ON-DEMAND OPTION –  For Victorian Mage, you will have the option of using DriveThruRPG.com’s Print-On-Demand service to purchase a physical, printed copy directly from their PoD partners at a discounted rate (this cost is not included in your pledge, and you do not need to increase the cost of your contribution to use this option). When the PoD versions are available to order (which will be some time after the book has gone to print), you will receive links to purchase these versions of the book from DriveThruRPG.com. You DO NOT need to take advantage of this PoD offer as it does not affect in any way your Perk rewards.


When selecting your Perk, you are able to add on these additional options. Each can be added to your DriveThruRPG.com digital library via a special redemption link that will be sent out as part of our perk fulfillment plan.


MAGE: THE ASCENSION 20TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION PDF (+$20) - Available from our partners at DriveThruRPG.com, The M20 rulebook is required to make full use of the rules and options presented in Victorian Mage.

M20 HOW DO YOU DO THAT? PDF (+$10) - Unlike any previous Mage sourcebook, How Do You DO That? strips away the series' trademark ambiguities and deals straight-up with the raw rule systems behind Mage's magick rules, Dividing a multitude of uncanny feats into 10 general categories.
M20 GODS & MONSTERS PDF (+$10) - This compendium of companions, divinities and beasts presents dozens of characters and creatures for your M20 saga.

VICTORIAN MAGE STORYTELLER REFERENCE SCREEN (+$20) - A sturdy, three-panel screen featuring a collage of Victorian Mage art on the outer side, and a selection of charts and other reference info on the inside to make running a Victorian-focused M20 game session a little bit easier. This Perk can only be added to contributions that include the deluxe hardcover (and thus include shipping).


As we increase the overall funding and support for the project, we’re able to add additional resources to the project, expand the rewards listed, and add in new offers and opportunities. Each Stretch Goal will have a target that, once reached, will add or expand upon a supplemental project. We will continue to build on this list when we achieve these targets during the campaign. Whenever we achieve a stretch goal, the image will be updated to reflect the achievement.
In addition, any funds generated in our Pledge Manager until May 24, 2021 will be included in the Stretch Goal Funding Target total, so some Stretch Goals could be unlocked after this campaign concludes! Only those backers who have pledged to this Indiegogo campaign will have these bonus rewards added to their Perk rewards list, however.

When you pledge to a reward tier that includes the Victorian Mage deluxe hardcover edition, Indiegogo will automatically calculate additional shipping costs based on your location.
Unfortunately, international shipping has become increasing expensive and is often prohibitive to non-US backers. Several contemporary publishers have decided to discontinue international shipping completely. For this project, Onyx Path wants to keep all options open to our customers, though shipping costs will reflect the expense. Please be aware that you are responsible for additional import duties, taxes, and brokerage fees, and that we must comply with international law and cannot mark your reward as a gift or as a zero-value item.
If you live outside of the US, here are your options for obtaining a physical copy:

Pledge to the campaign at $35+ contribution tier to get have the discounted print-on-demand redemption link included as part of your Perks. (see Reward Descriptions, above, for more details).
Though the deluxe edition will be printed in limited quantities, any excess stock from the print run will possibly be made available through re-sellers online. You can wait and see if it's possible to purchase at that time.
Pledge to the campaign at the $5 Supporter tier to get included in the manuscript preview e-mail list. Later, you can buy the PDF and/or Print-on-Demand when eventually released.
Contact your local game store and encourage them to back at the the Retailer Tier for this campaign, and then make sure you're put on a preorder list!
Look into a freight forwarding service that can give you a US-based shipping address, get packages delivered to it, and then forwarded to you.
If you don’t mind the high shipping costs, pledge to the appropriate reward tier and pay for shipping now! We'll send your package at the same time we fulfill domestic rewards.



After the campaign is over we'll launch BackerKit, our post-campaign pledge manager, and invite the contributors to confirm their perks via survey. This allows you to confirm your perks and add on anything that you might have missed, as well as possibly increasing your pledged reward tier, should you choose to expand your perk selection. This option will give international backers additional time to investigate shipping options, should they choose, knowing they can confirm a physical reward at a later date. Funding collected in BackerKit after the campaign WILL count toward any announced campaign Stretch Goals!.


Risk: This game isn't created at all even though the goal is reached.
Solution: We have successfully shipped many crowdfunded projects and more are headed to completion as you read this. All those projects have taught us how the various pieces of the process works, and we have increased our ability to judge the various stages of delivery better with each campaign. The text for Victorian Mage is finished and some initial interior artwork has been contracted, so the development process is well underway.
Risk: Shipping costs soak up pledges that were meant to enable the creation of the book.
Solution: Shipping costs have continued to rise over the past few years, but we are aware of that and were able to find ways to work with shippers to bring down those costs - unfortunately, only to some extent as we have also needed to increase the shipping charges- both methods allowing us to be sure that shipping doesn't eat up the pledge money supposed to go to printing.
Risk: The game will take a long time to produce and anger the backers.
Solution: We've learned many, many lessons with our previous crowdfunding campaigns and we're becoming much better at estimating the various pitfalls that will delay a project. We were able to deliver the PDFs for our last several projects months before the estimate, and our recent campaigns have delivered rewards on schedule. That being said, backers need to be aware that they are enabling a process, and not a pre-order opportunity, and things do sometimes run slower than we want or anticipate with that process. We've found that an open flow of communication between us and the backer community is vital so once the project funds we will deliver Updates on progress once a month (or more, as needed) via Indiegogo as well as in our regular weekly Monday Meeting Notes blog at www.theonyxpath.com
ADDITIONAL TERMS & CONDITIONS
By backing this Indiegogo project, you have agreed to the following additional terms and conditions:
ARTWORK, DESIGN, MATERIAL & CONTENTS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. Onyx Path shares artwork, design, descriptions and manuscript contents with the understanding that changes may occur in the creation of the final product based on further development, available resources and materials, and the nature of the creative process.
REWARDS REQUIRING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REQUIRE TIMELY RESPONSE. Some rewards, particularly limited Special Rewards such as art model descriptions, character names, and custom design work, require input from the reward backer. For these rewards, the backer must respond within 6 weeks of the information being requested (most likely by BackerKit pledge manager survey, occasionally by direct e-mail) in order to maintain the project development and manufacturing timeline. Onyx Path will make a strong effort to acquire this information, but should the backer not provide it in a timely fashion, all parties agree that Onyx Path can move forward on the project without the information or using an appropriate substitution and the respective backer will consider the reward obligation fulfilled in full for payment or donations pledged and collected on the part of Onyx Path. The simple fact is that we cannot delay the production of the product due to a unresponsive backer, that's just not fair to the others who have supported this project.
ADDRESS CONFIRMATION & DELIVERY OBLIGATIONS. If you confirm your pledge prior to final address confirmation and initiation of distribution notification via email, you agree that our responsibility to you is to ship your order as entered into our pledge manager system, that title and risk passes to you upon delivery to a common carrier for such shipment, and you are responsible for import duties or any other duties that may be payable to the relevant tax authorities, providing correct address information and ensuring this address is deliverable by normal methods. Failure to confirm mailing address prior to final request and distribution notification will be taken as agreement that all obligations have been met and no further action or effort is required on the part of Onyx Path. We will attempt to alert you via the methods provided by Indiegogo and/or BackerKit, primarily e-mail, prior to distribution of rewards to avoid any issue, but once we’ve made all reasonable efforts, we must move on with other business and will be unable to make exceptions.
DIGITAL REWARDS. You will be notified by BackerKit when digital rewards become available to you. Typically, these will be links to load PDF titles into your account library on DriveThruRPG.com. The links from BackerKit must be activated within 90 days to ensure the titles are added to your library, after which the links may expire and Onyx Path may not be able to provide replacements. If you do not accept these terms, please do not pledge on this project but instead wait for the general release.",43.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><i><strong>Street Masters </strong></i>is a 1-4 player cooperative miniatures board game inspired by classic beat ‘em up &amp; fighting video games. Featuring highly detailed miniatures, unique decks for fighters &amp; enemies, custom dice, and lightning-fast gameplay, <i><strong>Street Masters</strong></i> lets players match up powerful fighters against villainous organizations in a wide array of exciting stages!<br/><br/>Designed by Adam Sadler and Brady Sadler (<i>The Walking Dead: No Sanctuary, Warhammer Quest: The Adventure Card Game, Heroes of Terrinoth</i>), the game offers modular and elegant gameplay set in a unique world of street brawling action that combines the concept of a tactical combat board game with the flexibility of an intricate card game. Focusing on modularity and action, with fighters, bosses, rivals, allies, and stages forming a “sandbox” for players to mix-and-match, <i><strong>Street Masters</strong></i> allows you to create truly epic showdowns!<br/><br/>The game offers both an action-packed “Arcade Mode” where players completely customize their experience with any combination of fighters, bosses, and stages, as well as a narrative campaign “Story Mode,” where the fighters’ victories, defeats, and choices help upgrade their decks and unravel the lore of the game. A game plays in approximately 20-30 minutes per player.<br/> </p>

</div></div>","Street Masters is a 1-4 player cooperative miniatures board game inspired by classic beat ‘em up & fighting video games. Featuring highly detailed miniatures, unique decks for fighters & enemies, custom dice, and lightning-fast gameplay, Street Masters lets players match up powerful fighters against villainous organizations in a wide array of exciting stages!Designed by Adam Sadler and Brady Sadler (The Walking Dead: No Sanctuary, Warhammer Quest: The Adventure Card Game, Heroes of Terrinoth), the game offers modular and elegant gameplay set in a unique world of street brawling action that combines the concept of a tactical combat board game with the flexibility of an intricate card game. Focusing on modularity and action, with fighters, bosses, rivals, allies, and stages forming a “sandbox” for players to mix-and-match, Street Masters allows you to create truly epic showdowns!The game offers both an action-packed “Arcade Mode” where players completely customize their experience with any combination of fighters, bosses, and stages, as well as a narrative campaign “Story Mode,” where the fighters’ victories, defeats, and choices help upgrade their decks and unravel the lore of the game. A game plays in approximately 20-30 minutes per player.

<p>1870, Paris. After the first book about Captain Nemo and his submarine “Nautilus” raised great interest in public, Jules Verne is publishing the ending of the story about the mysterious captain. Right before his death, Nemo says that he will enclose his scientific findings and autobiography in a small unsinkable container: ""The last one of us left on the Nautilus will throw that container into the sea, and it will drift wherever the waves take it."" Right after that, Nautilus is destroyed. Although someone could think that the whole story is just a fantasy of Jules Verne, in private conversations the author admits that the characters are real. And now we can prove it!  </p>
<p>We have found the “unsinkable container” and it is now up to you to reveal the secret of Captain Nemo and find the lost traces of his scientific findings!</p>

<p>Designed and commanded by Captain Nemo, The Nautilus submarine was ""a masterpiece containing masterpieces"". One of the masterpieces is without any doubt the unsinkable secret container, whose drawings our team was lucky to receive from the mysterious Captain Nemo.  Our brave team of engineers and designers worked very hard to make the mechanics as well as the aesthetics of the box worthy of its legendary ancestor.</p>
<p>In accordance with the instructions that Captain Nemo left as a legacy, Nautilus Cluebox consists of 116 individual parts making it our most complex project so far. The puzzle is made with loving care out of birch wood and wood oil and assembled with care by hand.</p>

<p>Every backer is important to us, regardless of location. The reality is that shipping and sales taxes are expensive. To offset this we worked with our shipping partners to get the best conditions for our Indiegogo supporters. Here are the conditions that we can offer to different regions.</p>
<p><strong>European Union</strong></p>
<p>For the EU backers, your rewards will be sent duty-free from within your region - there will be no additional customs charge.  </p>
<p><strong>United States</strong></p>
<p>Considering our previous experience we are going to improve the shipping time to the US. To achieve that, we will use express shipment to the US distribution center without increasing the shipping price. US rewards will also be sent duty-free from within your region - there will be no additional customs charge. </p>
<p><strong>Australia</strong></p>
<p>Australian backers will also get duty-free express shipping to distribution center in AU with no additional customs charge. </p>
<p><strong>Canada</strong></p>
<p>The rewards to Canada will be sent from the distribution center in US. Please consider taxes that might apply for shipment from the US. </p>
<p><strong>All other countries</strong></p>
<p>We cannot guarantee customs-friendly shipping in areas outside of the US, AU and EU. There may be additional duties and/or fees charged by your country’s governmental agencies and/or shipping partners. Those fees are solely your responsibility, and we can neither cancel a shipped pledge nor will we pay those fees. In the event that a package is returned or destroyed due to the non-payment of such fees, your pledge will be considered fulfilled.</p>
<p>Approximate shipping prices are listed in the table below, but subject to change based on the pledge size. </p>

<p>This is our second Indiegogo Campaign and the third Cluebox that we will produce. We have delivered thousands of clueboxes to over 30 countries. Having gained valuable experience last year and starting the campaign this year in July we are even more confident in our ability to deliver the Cluebox to our backers before Christmas 2021. In the unlikely scenario that unexpected delays arise, we will maintain clear and open communication with our supporters to keep them informed.</p>

The Cluebox is an intriguing challenge. It's difficult to solve, satisfying to hold, and beautiful to display.  


 

 

1870, Paris. After the first book about Captain Nemo and his submarine “Nautilus” raised great interest in public, Jules Verne is publishing the ending of the story about the mysterious captain. Right before his death, Nemo says that he will enclose his scientific findings and autobiography in a small unsinkable container: ""The last one of us left on the Nautilus will throw that container into the sea, and it will drift wherever the waves take it."" Right after that, Nautilus is destroyed. Although someone could think that the whole story is just a fantasy of Jules Verne, in private conversations the author admits that the characters are real. And now we can prove it!  
We have found the “unsinkable container” and it is now up to you to reveal the secret of Captain Nemo and find the lost traces of his scientific findings!

 

Designed and commanded by Captain Nemo, The Nautilus submarine was ""a masterpiece containing masterpieces"". One of the masterpieces is without any doubt the unsinkable secret container, whose drawings our team was lucky to receive from the mysterious Captain Nemo.  Our brave team of engineers and designers worked very hard to make the mechanics as well as the aesthetics of the box worthy of its legendary ancestor.
In accordance with the instructions that Captain Nemo left as a legacy, Nautilus Cluebox consists of 116 individual parts making it our most complex project so far. The puzzle is made with loving care out of birch wood and wood oil and assembled with care by hand.

 


Professor Schrödinger - a famous Austrian physicist - forgot his cat in a box, while studying the problems of quantum mechanics. We are sure that the cat is still alive, and you must save it!

Secret space size: 1,5 x 4,5 x 8 cm
Play time: 45-60 min    


 
Davy Jones is the sea devil who locks away the wandering souls of all sailors who lose their lives at the sea.  We are sure that you are the one, who will finally be able to open the locker, release the souls and defeat Davy Jones.

 Box size: 11 x 11 x 12 cm
Secret space size: 1 x 4,5 x 6cm

Size: 10,5 x 6 cm
Our Kryptos can be easily reset and the secret word can be set to any word up to 6 letters.
Secret space size: 2 x 2 x 8 cm

 

 
Tin Woodman's Heart is a mechanical box with a lock and resettable combination key from three words. The key to open the box is a sentence combined out of 3 words, which can be changed. You can make it romantic and set the key as ""I love you"" or you can set it as a fun message e.g. ""I love beer"". There are 8 options/words on each wheel and you can use the possible combinations and set the key sentence that suits you the best.

Every backer is important to us, regardless of location. The reality is that shipping and sales taxes are expensive. To offset this we worked with our shipping partners to get the best conditions for our Indiegogo supporters. Here are the conditions that we can offer to different regions.
European Union
For the EU backers, your rewards will be sent duty-free from within your region - there will be no additional customs charge.  
United States
Considering our previous experience we are going to improve the shipping time to the US. To achieve that, we will use express shipment to the US distribution center without increasing the shipping price. US rewards will also be sent duty-free from within your region - there will be no additional customs charge. 
Australia
Australian backers will also get duty-free express shipping to distribution center in AU with no additional customs charge. 
Canada
The rewards to Canada will be sent from the distribution center in US. Please consider taxes that might apply for shipment from the US. 
All other countries
We cannot guarantee customs-friendly shipping in areas outside of the US, AU and EU. There may be additional duties and/or fees charged by your country’s governmental agencies and/or shipping partners. Those fees are solely your responsibility, and we can neither cancel a shipped pledge nor will we pay those fees. In the event that a package is returned or destroyed due to the non-payment of such fees, your pledge will be considered fulfilled.
Approximate shipping prices are listed in the table below, but subject to change based on the pledge size. 

 (*) We will add approximately 1 EUR for each additional product or add-on, it will depend on the country and product type
Risks and Challenges
This is our second Indiegogo Campaign and the third Cluebox that we will produce. We have delivered thousands of clueboxes to over 30 countries. Having gained valuable experience last year and starting the campaign this year in July we are even more confident in our ability to deliver the Cluebox to our backers before Christmas 2021. In the unlikely scenario that unexpected delays arise, we will maintain clear and open communication with our supporters to keep them informed.",21.0,0,"2 Campaigns

</ul><p><strong>Our commitment to functionality</strong> - From the first model we designed we made a commitment that everything we created would be with gameplay in mind. Each of our buildings has a fully modelled playable interior and our peg system allows for easy separation and reattachment of sections. As well, passageways and floor areas have been modelled to accommodate standard 1” bases, so you’ve always got enough space to move your figures about. We also try to include as many nooks and crannies and other surface areas for figures to perch on, hide in, and otherwise take advantage of the design of the model.</p><p><strong>Printer Friendly</strong> - All our models come with built in supports and are designed to be printed on an FDM printer and will fit on any standard 8""x8"" (200mm x 200mm) printer bed. We've carefully tested wall thickness, overhangs, potential bridging issues and other 3D printing pitfalls and have incorporated the most efficient way to print each part into our final .stl files.</p><p> </p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605758298/jfvnenszvia8aetssvtz.png"" src=""""/></p><p><i>The following is our artist's conception of what the various stretch goals and Encounter Sets will look like.

This campaign raised almost $180,000 on Kickstarter, and we're happy we can now bring it over to Indiegogo InDemand so that other tabletop gaming hobbyists can take advantage of this first chance at the new files. Please take a look below at the core sets we have available, plus all the stretch goals and Encounter Sets that may come with your pledge level. This campaign has three basic reward tiers: Bronze, Silver and Gold. Each of these reward tiers includes the three main core sets plus the new modular sets, as well as the stretch goals associated with that tier (see below for the infographic). In addition to the Bronze, Silver and Gold reward tiers, we are also offering the three core sets as individual pledges (plus their associated stretch goals). By far the most impressive building in town is The Last Hearth Inn, an interconnected set of buildings replete with detailed interiors, and a veritable hive of floors, rooms, suites and hallways. The Inn comes with two great halls, a private banquet room, thirteen floors total of interior playable space, forty-two (!) rooms, suites, and hallways, 'fog of war' covers for internal rooms, multiple stairways, balconies, as well as hidden rooms. Stretch goals will complete the Inn compound by adding kitchens, a coach house, an innkeepers' cottage and more. Check out the video below showing several of the inn's features. The Last Hearth Inn is famous for being the last safe place to rest in this dangerous land. Here gather the adventurers that seek fame and fortune in the unknown lands that surround the town. In this inn they prepare for the challenges ahead of them, meet strange characters, learn of quests and finally recharge after their latest exploits.
  The Torbridge is a 3D-printable modular bridge system, with ramps, spans, as well as a 3 to 5 story fort that attaches to the bridge. Build it as big as you want, add another story, or even a second fort (or a third!). Stretch Goals will add ruined sections, a drawbridge and more.  The Torbridge has plenty of room for fighting on the causeway, in the fort and even in hidden areas.The Torbridge, dominating the waterline, defends the only river crossing into the mountains and the Wightwood beyond. Check out this video giving you more details on how the Torbridge works. Rivalling the Last Hearth Inn in scale is the impressive bridge-fort know as the ‘Torbridge’. This imposing bridge serves as the first and last line of defence for this isolated town. It is here that the hoards of Orelog were turned back and thwarted from razing the town by the stalwart defenders of the town, the Knights of the Barrage.
   The Fighting Pits have a 'VIP' seating area, three entrances, several 'coward's nooks', a judge's podium, barracks, animal pens, a three-story building on the back, betting booths and concession stands. Inside is a 16"" diameter fighting area and a two rank deep seating area for spectators. 

 Ah the infamous fighting pits of Torbridge Cull, where the brave and foolhardy test their skill and courage against man and beast alike. If you happen to be passing through town, such a spectacular displays of pageantry and martial prowess should not be missed.

 

 
Start laying out the town and surrounding farms using our new sets of modular roads and riverbeds. For a more filled out tabletop, add in stone walls and hedge rows wherever you want. 

As with our previously released Modular Sets, these new sets will utilize our Battlegriplocking system.

Beyond the grand structures of the Last Hearth Inn, The Torbridge and the Fighting Pits lies the rest of the town. It is a downtrodden and forgotten place, once full of promise but now a backwater to all but those interested in exploring the unknown beyond the frontier. Stretch goals are classed in three categories and are available depending on your chosen reward tier. 



Bronze tier backers get only Bronze rewards, Silver Tier backers get both Bronze and Silver, and Gold Tier backers gets all three.
 

Backers of the ‘Torbridge Cull’ reward tiers will receive all three core buildings (the Last Hearth Inn, the Torbridge, the Fighting Pits), plus sets of modular roads, rivers, walls, and hedges, plus unlocked stretch goals appropriate to the tier they choose (Gold, Silver or Bronze). The image below shows what has been unlocked according to your tier level.

Dark blue (""Tierra del Fuego"") - cold, no sun.
Gray (“Seattle"") - usually cloudy or rainy.
Green (“Miami”) - usually sunny.

Red (“Phoenix”) - usually hot.
Then roll for weather. But if the die lands “cocked” or goes off the table, *weird* weather happens – pick the most different die and roll THAT one instead!There are eight weather symbols:

Snowflake - Cold. Roll again, and if you get another snowflake it is actually snowing!

Lightning - Stormy, with wind and rain. Roll again, and if you get more lightning, it is a *bad* lightning storm.

Raindrops - Rain. Roll again, and if you get more rain it’s rain all day.

Swirlies - Windy. Roll again to see what goes with the wind. Another “wind” result means *powerful* wind on a clear day.

Clouds - A cloudy day. Roll again – if you get a warm result, it’s warm, and if you get a cold or rain result, it’s a bit chilly.

<h2>Closing the orders</h2>
<p>I left the campaign up as ""InDemand"" after the campaign ended, and we have indeed had some latecomers join in the fun, so that went well. However, InDemand's fee structure doesn't really work for a small project like this in the long tail (you basically pay ~30 € every month straight off the top), and most of us probably don't love IndieGoGo quite enough to just have 98% of the payments go into their expenses, so it makes more sense to close that down now that we're only drawing in one or two people a week.</p>
<p>The nature of the project is inherently such that you're not really missing much by not getting to participate; everything we're doing here is ultimately going to become more or less free. If you just want to give me money, you can do that on my website directly. And if you're just really into the idea of the <i>Coup Workbook Partials</i>, email me about it and we'll work something out.</p>
<hr/>
<h2>Funding was successful!</h2>
<p>We have found the planned-for amount of backing, and the project is currently being worked on. Check the recent update posts for how the work is progressing.</p>
<p>The Indiegogo platform allows us to keep selling the project after the funding period, so I'm leaving the pitch and the perks up for now; the world's a big place and surely many people haven't even heard about this yet. The nature of the Muster project is more about funding a common weal than me selling something to you, so there's no <i>really</i> good reason to keep giving me money now that we've reached our funding goal. Here are the best arguments for contributing more anyway:</p>
<ul>
<li>Join up on the lowest level to get project updates in email. I'll be reporting on the project's progress regularly, so if you're interested, this is the easiest way to keep up to date on it over the coming months.</li>
<li>If you think the project looks promising and I should be given more money for it, I appreciate the sentiment. I could use a bit more money for the art budget (basically, more money = more elaborate visuals for the book, as I haggle for more work out of the art team), but mostly you should just give me more money because I like seeing the number bars go up. Makes me feel loved.</li>
<li>
<i>Muster</i> will be put out as a free PDF (creative commons license is the current thinking), but if you'd like to join a common print run, I'll be doing some POD later for those who like paper books. You can join the pre-order as an addon Perk after selecting any of the basic perks. It's entirely feasible to print it yourself once it's finished, of course; could be cheaper, what with the postages.</li>
<li>My backer incentive program is a kinda-collectable series of digital campaign material from our on-going old school D&amp;D campaign <i>Coup de Main</i> — it's discussed in more detail in the campaign pitch below. While you can barter for these with campaign backers later on, joining the campaign is the most straightforward way to get in on the ""fun"". I imagine that the <i>Coup Workbook Partials</i> will be released to the wild at some point in like Q2 of 2021, but we'll see.</li>
<li>At this writing I still have one Name Level slot open, so the window is open for one more ""special order"". Just saying, in case you have a fun idea for what <i>Muster</i> should be.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>So yeah, I basically recommend joining up on the lowest level just for the campaign update convenience. Assuming I remain productive over the coming months, we should see some regular progress on this over the next half year or so. Probably going to be some previews and invitations to discourse on how the project should shape out, and so on — could be interesting.</p>

<img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605859367/btfu5ngr4jcwrthtedfy.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;margin-right:1em;""/><h2>The Campaign Pitch</h2>
<p>I think that old school <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i> is a unique jewel of a game, one of the few 20th century games that will stand the test of time. The rpg hobby has produced a limited number of truly unique visions, but the adventure game with neutral referee, player-directed events and anti-dramatist wargaming ethos surely qualifies. As hobbyists know, a more story-oriented ""GM as storyteller"" paradigm sidelined this game relatively early in the history of the hobby, so the jewel here is just a bit obscure, not exactly touted front and center, but nevertheless it shines; over the last decade, the OSR movement has proved amply how the core proposition of the game remains as vital as ever.</p>
<p>However, I also think that the wargamey D&amp;D is somewhat poorly documented textually. People love to publish their campaign rules, and there's a long history of official publications to pick and choose from, but actual teaching texts are a bit sparse on the ground. If anything, the focus on mechanical rules has detracted from analytical understanding and arguably encouraged the loss of wargaming ethos in favour of a thin understanding of the game. Figuring out the real game (the one behind the mechanics, the actual method) is still largely a matter of oral tradition and mentorship via actual play.</p>
<p>I remember how big of an impact Matt Finch's <a href=""https://www.lulu.com/content/e-book/quick-primer-for-old-school-gaming/3019374"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Quick Primer for Old School Gaming</a> was for me specifically because it was an attempt at taking a step back and discussing not only what the rules are, but also what the method behind the rules was. My D&amp;D theory might not match his in all particulars, but ""Rulings, not rules"" was and is a decisive truth. This is how old school D&amp;D should be taught: not by describing the game mechanics of an individual campaign, but by establishing a theory of what the game is attempting to accomplish, and by what methods.</p>Ideally, what I'd like there to be is a book that could teach old school D&amp;D to newcomers (with prior rpg experience or not) in a way independent from a specific product line. Something I could give to a new player to look over at home, and perhaps be inspired to try. A book about what's great and desirable about the game, and how to draw that out, rather than a book of equipment prices and spell lists.<p><i>Muster: A Friendly Primer to Challengeful Dungeoneering</i> would be that book.</p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605862620/bw7uvccvphnoyvyvczbs.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/><h2>We Can Make It</h2>
<p>I'm not a D&amp;D kid; the game was considered primitive and outdated in our local scene in my teens, while unified-mechanics universal skill systems (descendants of <i>Runequest</i>, basically) were all the rage. I well remember how thoroughly irrelevant AD&amp;D 2e and Mentzer Basic seemed to me in that creative context. Much later on, the game basically won me over on theoretical, technical merits: as I learned more about challengeful adventure gaming over the '00s (mainly at <a href=""http://www.indie-rpgs.com/forge/index.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">the Forge</a>, if that says anything), the things older D&amp;D was trying to do started to click for me until I realized that it wasn't accidental at all; these people were <i>actually trying to play</i> with a grand vision very similar to what I was interested in accomplishing in the field. I wasn't pushing D&amp;D forward so much as I was taking it back.</p>
<p>I've developed a pretty strong take on old school D&amp;D over the last 15 years or so, enough so that I'm putting myself forward as somebody who maybe should write up some of my insights in a structured way. My game is:</p>
<ul>
<li>very <strong>challenge-focused</strong>, with real wins and losses front and center. Glory and disappointment abound in a way similar to sports or other challenging activities.</li>
<li>very <strong>wargamey</strong> in the simulative sense: the game is about maneuvering in the fictional world rather than manipulating formal game mechanics like in a boardgame; the latter exists boldly, as it does in D&amp;D, but in service to fun and powerful simulation rather than independent of it.</li>
<li>
<strong>egalitarian</strong>, with the campaign conceived as a joint operation more than the GM's personal power-trip. The referee is a functionary of the process; maybe primus inter pares, but nevertheless fundamentally equal.</li>
<li>
<strong>creative</strong> rather than consumerist; we are the authors of our own activity, perhaps informed by others via various books, but never beholden to the Official Rules from distant masters.</li>
<li>
<strong>authentic</strong> rather than ritualistic; the grand purpose of a D&amp;D campaign is to game out the implications of the campaign set-up rather than replicate the GM's expectations of what D&amp;D adventuring is ""supposed to be"". We discover the truth via play.</li>
</ul>An essential vision for this project is that <i>Muster</i> will be a free, probably Creative Commons licensed booklet that anybody can pick up off the 'net and do whatever with. I'll see about putting it out in some format that actually makes it easy to modify it so you can outright make it your own; I can't imagine another GM having <i>exactly</i> the same ideas on how the game plays, but perhaps you can distill your own dao of D&amp;D from mine and have a snappy primer for inducting new players for your campaign, too!<p>The campaign is on all-or-nothing funding, calculated for some art budget and a modest ransom for the author. We can do some printing to get the book out in physical format as well if you're into that, but the basic plan would be to create something useful and then release it out there to hopefully be utilized lots and lots by hobbyists in need of this sort of pedagogical material.</p> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605863937/mmebryaavc4oa3on5mfc.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/><h2>Product Details</h2>
<p>I envision <i>Muster</i> as a neat little booklet. Maybe home-printed when it falls into your hands, probably with some underground (read: authentic) aesthetics, but essentially as low-threshold and inviting a read as I can manage.</p>
<p>Historically when D&amp;D tries to be friendly and welcoming, it often goes in the direction of childish and cartoony, but that's not what I'm thinking here. <i>Muster</i> should be a bit like a current-day minis wargame rulebook: clean and easy to read, light layout and generally adult aesthetics and concerns. The message is that the game is fun, yes, but also a serious endeavour, and exciting for intellectual and emotional reasons that go beyond superficial whizz-boom video game aesthetics. It is a bit grim, because it is about a game of dungeon commando warfare, but it's the intellectualized grimness of the wargame armchair, somewhat distant from the human reality of violence.</p>
<p>I got the clever idea of having one of my long-time gaming friends, Sipi, illustrate <i>Muster</i>; this is very appropriate, as Sipi — and his 7th level Fighter-Condottiere — has played a critical role in developing our playstyle over the years, so he understands the creative agenda in play here as much as anyone. Plus, I like his grungy gamer-sketching-while-bored style more than calculated commercial illustration.</p>In practical terms I'm envisioning Muster as a 30–50 page booklet/PDF. It has not been written yet (we're seeking funding to justify the writing commitment here), but the topic and scope — the agenda — are very clear: a book that you can read alongside a rules text (e.g. <i>Swords &amp; Wizardry</i> or <i>LotFP</i> or <i>Mentzer Basic</i> or whatnot) as a study guide and come away with an enhanced, inspired understanding of what makes the game so great, and how to play it well. Here are a few cornerstone elements that the manuscript will cover:<ul>
<li>What is the joy, the promise of the game? Connect the reader to the tradition of wargaming, explain why the praxeology of the art of war is relevant to general human interests, and how this nobility underlies the play of D&amp;D. It is a deeply philosophical thing, and the game's creative ambition is so majestic that one cannot help but be inspired.</li>
<li>How the game's underlying methodical structures, distinct from its formal game mechanics, structure and drive play. This is the real meat in terms of ""how to play"", I feel; understanding player roles and responsibilities,  establishing and resolving challenges, rulings-based organic resolution processes, the role that formal game mechanics have to play, is foundational to playing the game purposefully.</li>
<li>A frank overview of the textual history of D&amp;D and its relevance for this playstyle; given that you like what's suggested here, what game texts might be particularly useful accompaniment in developing your own campaign?</li>
<li>Practical advice on how to go about setting up your own campaign, and how to maintain it long-term. Envisioning this process as less about selecting a game text to commit to, and more as a process of creative self-expression where you wield texts as tools.</li>
<li>How to be a good character player, as opposed to referee, in this kind of campaign. The game offers some magnificent opportunities for being an active and influential participant, yet it is easy to fail to grasp these opportunities for want of knowledge of how to participate well.</li>
</ul> <img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1605902844/i9mhugabg3dpwb8t2dcr.png"" src="""" style=""float: left;""/><h2>I Have Excellent Backer Incentives</h2>
<p>As you can see from the backer tiers, I did put in a limited deluxe option for anybody wanting to be a boss backer. I was thinking that while I'm not interested in like printing a hardcover prestige edition of <i>Muster</i> (easy money, but I think it's not that kind of book) for you, what I <i>can</i> do is make sure you get the old school primer you can actually use: I'll edit you a personal edition of the book.</p>
<p>So how this works is that I'll get you into the early access studio critique team, you get to tell me where you disagree with Muster the way it's shaping out, and I'll dual edit my version and your version of the primer side by side. We can call yours the ""Tobias Whale edition"" or whatever; you choose whether to keep it private or make it available to others. This won't be an entirely different manuscript, but I will do all the actual work on it, and you'll find that as long as you know what you want, we can create the old school primer with the theory, phrasing and emphasis that you can personally underwrite. Something that you can give your players and honestly say that you agree with every word. Even if you love setpiece scenes or something dumb like that, I'll still write it for you.</p>
<p>I don't know if anybody's interested in something like this, but if you are, there's no reason why I can't create a couple of alternate primer texts while working on Muster. As all the overhead elements of the project are shared, it doesn't make that much of a difference for me to develop some forks — it's just a bit more manuscript text, as layouts and illustrations and such are all shared. Could be fun!</p>
<h3>Coup Workbook Partials</h3>
<p>Here's the real zinger in the backer incentives department, though:</p>
<p>When I first conceived of the <i>Muster</i> project last summer, I didn't have any idea at all of what to offer backers aside from the finished primer. That was the basic idea, after all.</p>
<p>However, one of the things I did start doing back then (and a major reason for why it took me half a year to move on the actual crowdfunding affair) is my new online voice chat D&amp;D campaign, <i>Coup de Main in Greyhawk</i>! Here, have some representative links:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://www.arkenstonepublishing.net/isabout/2020/06/07/new-on-desk-23-coup-de-main-in-greyhawk/#0-coup-de-main-pitch"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">The campaign pitch from last summer</a></li>
<li>A fairly legible <a href=""https://www.arkenstonepublishing.net/isabout/2020/07/05/new-on-desk-27-high-tier-coup/#1-aspirational-design-in-coup-de-main"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">strategy essay on ""aspirational design""</a> of high-level old school D&amp;D</li>
<li>
<a href=""https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSZm7xAXnAEfqAg10R7G6mxJS3XQgdw4NG-e2lcuXQaAMWIOQ0Jka4lrOFEyFjlvKUxit-DnY0pZvVr/pub"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">One of my campaign rules workbooks</a> that we amass and add to as the campaign progresses</li>
</ul>
<p>(The Coup campaign is very much still on-going, by the way; the campaign supports English-language play, and while participation has been stable, we can certainly accommodate some visitors. Let me know if you're interested in checking the campaign out, we're friendly and open to new faces.)</p>
<p>So what I realized recently is that although I started the Coup campaign as a general way of getting back into old school campaigning after a break of a couple of years, we've actually managed to develop quite a bit of interesting campaign cruft over the last half year. The campaign rules are sort of loosely adapted Basic, except I'm applying everything I know of game design to fill the campaign with fun and expressive mechanical ideas that support my vision of wargamey D&amp;D rather than distracting from it. I feel that this is top-shelf stuff.</p>
<p>My idea is that while I'm not interested in (or ready to) developing a complete manuscript on the Coup, as the campaign is still developing, it wouldn't be at all premature to distribute some ashcans — alpha playtest manuscript material. I've written quite a bit of Coup stuff for internal campaign use over the last months; clean it up a bit in editing and I believe it can be a potent source of inspiration for other GM's wrestling with similar concerns.</p>
<p>My quirky and (hopefully) fun idea of how to do this is as follows: if the crowdfunding campaign reaches its goal, I'll revise my campaign notes into a series of short 3–10 page ""workbook partials"" — essays on specific campaign topics — and everybody gets some in proportion to their contribution; say 1 issue per 5 € contributed or so. I'll publish a list of topics later, but there'll be class write-ups for both classic and new classes, magic systems, my takes on basic systems like chargen and combat, and more. In fact, here are some quick high-lights:</p>
<ul>
<li>I took the Mentzer Immortals rules for divinities, coupled it with some Gygaxian Greyhawk ideas for how gods work, and developed a hell of an interesting chassis for how to mechanize divine powers better. Side benefits in revising divine magic for Clerics and developing xianxia style divine Cultivation rules for Monks or whomever.</li>
<li>I recently wrote up my first original class for the campaign, the ""Hedge Mage"" (or ""Witch"", I'm sort of undecided on which name I like more). It's conceptually in-between modern D&amp;D Sorcerer, Warlock, Psion and Artificer, except cooler. Very much a ""magic is an Art"" statement capable of standing toe to toe with the Wizard's ""magic is Science"" truth.</li>
<li>Our character generation system has become hilariously entertaining with the addition of things like boneyard levels (roguelike players know where I'm at) for discarded character seeds, functional multiclassing for all, actually game-relevant stat-based XP bonus mechanics and all kinds of other fun stuff. We're really rocking the idea that generating a new character should be a fun dice-lottery with surprising and inspiring outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fun part here is that because there'll be a bunch of these workbook partials, you'll get to trade for the whole set with others who got a different set from the gacha machine. A bit of a trading card collection affair among presumably like-minded people, so who knows, it might be a chance to get to know some new people. So everybody gets the whole set if you want it, regardless of how much funding you contribute; I'm not suggesting that my campaign workbooks are worth like a hundred euros or whatever the total nominal price comes to.</p>
<p>I hope the idea comes across there; I can work out some sample drafts later on what the workbook partials would look like, but think 'zine, ashcan stuff; simple, text-oriented, intended for expert referees capable of parsing technical shorthand for ideas they can use. I myself love this kind of authentic and information-dense stuff, so I think you'll enjoy it as well.</p>

<p>This is the first time I'm trying out crowdfunding as a publishing approach, so I hope the project seems as reasonable to you as it does to me. I have plenty of experience with the practicalities of writing and publishing — it's basically my job, this isn't my first rodeo — so I'm not worried about being able to write up a modestly-sized book like <i>Muster</i> if it gains your favour. I'd presumably draft the thing out over the winter and finish up over next year, barring major distractions. Ideally it'll be a fun, successful little project that can work as a starting point for writing up some more old school D&amp;D stuff later on.</p>
<p>(If the above pitch inspires any questions or suggestions on how to be more appealing, please do critique the campaign. I'm not exactly on my natural ground with this sort of social media crowdfunding stuff.)</p>
<p>I'm actually mostly concerned about the marketing penetration of the campaign in the current-day hobby scene, being as how scattered and diffuse it all is. If you like what you're seeing, or simply deem it curious, please help out by telling about the campaign to your friends and communities. I'm not very good at social networking myself, signing up for a new forum is often the work of years, so I'm actually worried that I don't really have a sufficiently high profile in the scene for anybody to notice the campaign. I'm cool with you all checking out this proposition and deciding that it's not good return for the money, but having it fail because nobody notices would make me sad.</p>
<p>Beyond these initial concerns, though, we'll have to see how things go — how much interest you have in this thing. There's some potential for expanding the project in terms of stretch goals and such, open it up to more ambitious vistas, but perhaps we'll see first whether a Friendly Primer to Challenging Dungeoneering is deemed useful. If you have your own ideas and wishes for where to take this thing, do let me know; this campaign is basically me opening the doors to the idea of developing some stuff in the old school field, so I'm obviously interested in what you view as useful and meaningful to publish. However this goes, we'll have learned something.</p>
</div></div>","Closing the orders
I left the campaign up as ""InDemand"" after the campaign ended, and we have indeed had some latecomers join in the fun, so that went well. However, InDemand's fee structure doesn't really work for a small project like this in the long tail (you basically pay ~30 € every month straight off the top), and most of us probably don't love IndieGoGo quite enough to just have 98% of the payments go into their expenses, so it makes more sense to close that down now that we're only drawing in one or two people a week.
The nature of the project is inherently such that you're not really missing much by not getting to participate; everything we're doing here is ultimately going to become more or less free. If you just want to give me money, you can do that on my website directly. And if you're just really into the idea of the Coup Workbook Partials, email me about it and we'll work something out.

Funding was successful!
We have found the planned-for amount of backing, and the project is currently being worked on. Check the recent update posts for how the work is progressing.
The Indiegogo platform allows us to keep selling the project after the funding period, so I'm leaving the pitch and the perks up for now; the world's a big place and surely many people haven't even heard about this yet. The nature of the Muster project is more about funding a common weal than me selling something to you, so there's no really good reason to keep giving me money now that we've reached our funding goal. Here are the best arguments for contributing more anyway:

Join up on the lowest level to get project updates in email. I'll be reporting on the project's progress regularly, so if you're interested, this is the easiest way to keep up to date on it over the coming months.
If you think the project looks promising and I should be given more money for it, I appreciate the sentiment. I could use a bit more money for the art budget (basically, more money = more elaborate visuals for the book, as I haggle for more work out of the art team), but mostly you should just give me more money because I like seeing the number bars go up. Makes me feel loved.

Muster will be put out as a free PDF (creative commons license is the current thinking), but if you'd like to join a common print run, I'll be doing some POD later for those who like paper books. You can join the pre-order as an addon Perk after selecting any of the basic perks. It's entirely feasible to print it yourself once it's finished, of course; could be cheaper, what with the postages.
My backer incentive program is a kinda-collectable series of digital campaign material from our on-going old school D&D campaign Coup de Main — it's discussed in more detail in the campaign pitch below. While you can barter for these with campaign backers later on, joining the campaign is the most straightforward way to get in on the ""fun"". I imagine that the Coup Workbook Partials will be released to the wild at some point in like Q2 of 2021, but we'll see.
At this writing I still have one Name Level slot open, so the window is open for one more ""special order"". Just saying, in case you have a fun idea for what Muster should be.

 
So yeah, I basically recommend joining up on the lowest level just for the campaign update convenience. Assuming I remain productive over the coming months, we should see some regular progress on this over the next half year or so. Probably going to be some previews and invitations to discourse on how the project should shape out, and so on — could be interesting.
 


The Campaign Pitch
I think that old school Dungeons & Dragons is a unique jewel of a game, one of the few 20th century games that will stand the test of time. The rpg hobby has produced a limited number of truly unique visions, but the adventure game with neutral referee, player-directed events and anti-dramatist wargaming ethos surely qualifies. As hobbyists know, a more story-oriented ""GM as storyteller"" paradigm sidelined this game relatively early in the history of the hobby, so the jewel here is just a bit obscure, not exactly touted front and center, but nevertheless it shines; over the last decade, the OSR movement has proved amply how the core proposition of the game remains as vital as ever.
However, I also think that the wargamey D&D is somewhat poorly documented textually. People love to publish their campaign rules, and there's a long history of official publications to pick and choose from, but actual teaching texts are a bit sparse on the ground. If anything, the focus on mechanical rules has detracted from analytical understanding and arguably encouraged the loss of wargaming ethos in favour of a thin understanding of the game. Figuring out the real game (the one behind the mechanics, the actual method) is still largely a matter of oral tradition and mentorship via actual play.
I remember how big of an impact Matt Finch's Quick Primer for Old School Gaming was for me specifically because it was an attempt at taking a step back and discussing not only what the rules are, but also what the method behind the rules was. My D&D theory might not match his in all particulars, but ""Rulings, not rules"" was and is a decisive truth. This is how old school D&D should be taught: not by describing the game mechanics of an individual campaign, but by establishing a theory of what the game is attempting to accomplish, and by what methods.Ideally, what I'd like there to be is a book that could teach old school D&D to newcomers (with prior rpg experience or not) in a way independent from a specific product line. Something I could give to a new player to look over at home, and perhaps be inspired to try. A book about what's great and desirable about the game, and how to draw that out, rather than a book of equipment prices and spell lists.Muster: A Friendly Primer to Challengeful Dungeoneering would be that book. We Can Make It
I'm not a D&D kid; the game was considered primitive and outdated in our local scene in my teens, while unified-mechanics universal skill systems (descendants of Runequest, basically) were all the rage. I well remember how thoroughly irrelevant AD&D 2e and Mentzer Basic seemed to me in that creative context. Much later on, the game basically won me over on theoretical, technical merits: as I learned more about challengeful adventure gaming over the '00s (mainly at the Forge, if that says anything), the things older D&D was trying to do started to click for me until I realized that it wasn't accidental at all; these people were actually trying to play with a grand vision very similar to what I was interested in accomplishing in the field. I wasn't pushing D&D forward so much as I was taking it back.
I've developed a pretty strong take on old school D&D over the last 15 years or so, enough so that I'm putting myself forward as somebody who maybe should write up some of my insights in a structured way. My game is:

very challenge-focused, with real wins and losses front and center. Glory and disappointment abound in a way similar to sports or other challenging activities.
very wargamey in the simulative sense: the game is about maneuvering in the fictional world rather than manipulating formal game mechanics like in a boardgame; the latter exists boldly, as it does in D&D, but in service to fun and powerful simulation rather than independent of it.

egalitarian, with the campaign conceived as a joint operation more than the GM's personal power-trip. The referee is a functionary of the process; maybe primus inter pares, but nevertheless fundamentally equal.

creative rather than consumerist; we are the authors of our own activity, perhaps informed by others via various books, but never beholden to the Official Rules from distant masters.

authentic rather than ritualistic; the grand purpose of a D&D campaign is to game out the implications of the campaign set-up rather than replicate the GM's expectations of what D&D adventuring is ""supposed to be"". We discover the truth via play.
An essential vision for this project is that Muster will be a free, probably Creative Commons licensed booklet that anybody can pick up off the 'net and do whatever with. I'll see about putting it out in some format that actually makes it easy to modify it so you can outright make it your own; I can't imagine another GM having exactly the same ideas on how the game plays, but perhaps you can distill your own dao of D&D from mine and have a snappy primer for inducting new players for your campaign, too!The campaign is on all-or-nothing funding, calculated for some art budget and a modest ransom for the author. We can do some printing to get the book out in physical format as well if you're into that, but the basic plan would be to create something useful and then release it out there to hopefully be utilized lots and lots by hobbyists in need of this sort of pedagogical material. Product Details
I envision Muster as a neat little booklet. Maybe home-printed when it falls into your hands, probably with some underground (read: authentic) aesthetics, but essentially as low-threshold and inviting a read as I can manage.
Historically when D&D tries to be friendly and welcoming, it often goes in the direction of childish and cartoony, but that's not what I'm thinking here. Muster should be a bit like a current-day minis wargame rulebook: clean and easy to read, light layout and generally adult aesthetics and concerns. The message is that the game is fun, yes, but also a serious endeavour, and exciting for intellectual and emotional reasons that go beyond superficial whizz-boom video game aesthetics. It is a bit grim, because it is about a game of dungeon commando warfare, but it's the intellectualized grimness of the wargame armchair, somewhat distant from the human reality of violence.
I got the clever idea of having one of my long-time gaming friends, Sipi, illustrate Muster; this is very appropriate, as Sipi — and his 7th level Fighter-Condottiere — has played a critical role in developing our playstyle over the years, so he understands the creative agenda in play here as much as anyone. Plus, I like his grungy gamer-sketching-while-bored style more than calculated commercial illustration.In practical terms I'm envisioning Muster as a 30–50 page booklet/PDF. It has not been written yet (we're seeking funding to justify the writing commitment here), but the topic and scope — the agenda — are very clear: a book that you can read alongside a rules text (e.g. Swords & Wizardry or LotFP or Mentzer Basic or whatnot) as a study guide and come away with an enhanced, inspired understanding of what makes the game so great, and how to play it well. Here are a few cornerstone elements that the manuscript will cover:
What is the joy, the promise of the game? Connect the reader to the tradition of wargaming, explain why the praxeology of the art of war is relevant to general human interests, and how this nobility underlies the play of D&D. It is a deeply philosophical thing, and the game's creative ambition is so majestic that one cannot help but be inspired.
How the game's underlying methodical structures, distinct from its formal game mechanics, structure and drive play. This is the real meat in terms of ""how to play"", I feel; understanding player roles and responsibilities,  establishing and resolving challenges, rulings-based organic resolution processes, the role that formal game mechanics have to play, is foundational to playing the game purposefully.
A frank overview of the textual history of D&D and its relevance for this playstyle; given that you like what's suggested here, what game texts might be particularly useful accompaniment in developing your own campaign?
Practical advice on how to go about setting up your own campaign, and how to maintain it long-term. Envisioning this process as less about selecting a game text to commit to, and more as a process of creative self-expression where you wield texts as tools.
How to be a good character player, as opposed to referee, in this kind of campaign. The game offers some magnificent opportunities for being an active and influential participant, yet it is easy to fail to grasp these opportunities for want of knowledge of how to participate well.
 I Have Excellent Backer Incentives
As you can see from the backer tiers, I did put in a limited deluxe option for anybody wanting to be a boss backer. I was thinking that while I'm not interested in like printing a hardcover prestige edition of Muster (easy money, but I think it's not that kind of book) for you, what I can do is make sure you get the old school primer you can actually use: I'll edit you a personal edition of the book.
So how this works is that I'll get you into the early access studio critique team, you get to tell me where you disagree with Muster the way it's shaping out, and I'll dual edit my version and your version of the primer side by side. We can call yours the ""Tobias Whale edition"" or whatever; you choose whether to keep it private or make it available to others. This won't be an entirely different manuscript, but I will do all the actual work on it, and you'll find that as long as you know what you want, we can create the old school primer with the theory, phrasing and emphasis that you can personally underwrite. Something that you can give your players and honestly say that you agree with every word. Even if you love setpiece scenes or something dumb like that, I'll still write it for you.
I don't know if anybody's interested in something like this, but if you are, there's no reason why I can't create a couple of alternate primer texts while working on Muster. As all the overhead elements of the project are shared, it doesn't make that much of a difference for me to develop some forks — it's just a bit more manuscript text, as layouts and illustrations and such are all shared. Could be fun!
Coup Workbook Partials
Here's the real zinger in the backer incentives department, though:
When I first conceived of the Muster project last summer, I didn't have any idea at all of what to offer backers aside from the finished primer. That was the basic idea, after all.
However, one of the things I did start doing back then (and a major reason for why it took me half a year to move on the actual crowdfunding affair) is my new online voice chat D&D campaign, Coup de Main in Greyhawk! Here, have some representative links:

The campaign pitch from last summer
A fairly legible strategy essay on ""aspirational design"" of high-level old school D&D

One of my campaign rules workbooks that we amass and add to as the campaign progresses

(The Coup campaign is very much still on-going, by the way; the campaign supports English-language play, and while participation has been stable, we can certainly accommodate some visitors. Let me know if you're interested in checking the campaign out, we're friendly and open to new faces.)
So what I realized recently is that although I started the Coup campaign as a general way of getting back into old school campaigning after a break of a couple of years, we've actually managed to develop quite a bit of interesting campaign cruft over the last half year. The campaign rules are sort of loosely adapted Basic, except I'm applying everything I know of game design to fill the campaign with fun and expressive mechanical ideas that support my vision of wargamey D&D rather than distracting from it. I feel that this is top-shelf stuff.
My idea is that while I'm not interested in (or ready to) developing a complete manuscript on the Coup, as the campaign is still developing, it wouldn't be at all premature to distribute some ashcans — alpha playtest manuscript material. I've written quite a bit of Coup stuff for internal campaign use over the last months; clean it up a bit in editing and I believe it can be a potent source of inspiration for other GM's wrestling with similar concerns.
My quirky and (hopefully) fun idea of how to do this is as follows: if the crowdfunding campaign reaches its goal, I'll revise my campaign notes into a series of short 3–10 page ""workbook partials"" — essays on specific campaign topics — and everybody gets some in proportion to their contribution; say 1 issue per 5 € contributed or so. I'll publish a list of topics later, but there'll be class write-ups for both classic and new classes, magic systems, my takes on basic systems like chargen and combat, and more. In fact, here are some quick high-lights:

I took the Mentzer Immortals rules for divinities, coupled it with some Gygaxian Greyhawk ideas for how gods work, and developed a hell of an interesting chassis for how to mechanize divine powers better. Side benefits in revising divine magic for Clerics and developing xianxia style divine Cultivation rules for Monks or whomever.
I recently wrote up my first original class for the campaign, the ""Hedge Mage"" (or ""Witch"", I'm sort of undecided on which name I like more). It's conceptually in-between modern D&D Sorcerer, Warlock, Psion and Artificer, except cooler. Very much a ""magic is an Art"" statement capable of standing toe to toe with the Wizard's ""magic is Science"" truth.
Our character generation system has become hilariously entertaining with the addition of things like boneyard levels (roguelike players know where I'm at) for discarded character seeds, functional multiclassing for all, actually game-relevant stat-based XP bonus mechanics and all kinds of other fun stuff. We're really rocking the idea that generating a new character should be a fun dice-lottery with surprising and inspiring outcomes.

The fun part here is that because there'll be a bunch of these workbook partials, you'll get to trade for the whole set with others who got a different set from the gacha machine.

I myself love this kind of authentic and information-dense stuff, so I think you'll enjoy it as well.

Outside of combat, it uses a d10 dice system, where players roll a number of dice equal to their skill or base stat and succeed by having a minimum number of dice meet or exceed a target number. In this system, a die result of 1 or 10 are special. Each unmodified roll of 1 is a critical failure, and subtracts 1 from the result of the lowest die that met the target number. Rolling an unmodified 1 and not having enough successful dice to accomplish the task results in a critical failure. Each unmodified roll of a 10 ""explodes"", meaning that an additional dice is immediately added to the character's dice pool.

The unmodified 1 subtracts 1 from her lowest succesful roll, turning the 6 into a 5. This would normally mean a failure, and a critical failure because of the 1 result.

Not only will raising this money help our team focus more on the development and mechanics, but it will also help give our game the visual edge we desire. While we are asking for $5,000, that money is the bare minimum needed to get the book out the door while continuing to work on this game in our spare time between our other jobs. In reality, we need $30,000 in order to fully afford all the art and production costs for the book. Any additional money raised after that first $30,000 will go towards a split between staff wages, thus allowing us to work more full time on the game, and stretch goal production costs.

Ultimately, we suggest checking out the videos above for an in depth lesson. However, the short version looks something like this:</p><p> </p><p>The god Ze’Quarius created the world and everything in it. Through his exploits, he also created the Demi-Fauna, Demi-Planar, and humans. After 1,000 years of coexistence, the Demi-Fauna grew tired of Ze’Quarius’ favouritism of the humans and disregard of the Demi-Fauna and thus waged war against him. This war, called the War of Dethronement, lasted 10 years and ended with the Demi-Fauna sealing  Ze’Quarius in a mountain. However, during his final moments, Ze’Quarius cursed the Demi-Fauna to only ever birth women. </p><p> </p><p>After the War of Dethronement, the Demi-Fauna sought to subjugate the humans and make them their slaves. Humanity struggled for 50 years during what became known as the Subjugation Wars. However, through their tenacity and the dwindling Demi-Fauna numbers due to the curse, humanity eventually prevailed and enslaved the Demi-Fauna. </p><p> </p><p>Due to a plague known as the Mage Blight, humanity banned the use of magic and further discriminated against the Demi-Fauna, after which Asstoria settled down and knew peace for the first time since the War of Dethronement.</p><p> </p><p>Then, 73 years after the Mage Blight plague ravished the land, the world was thrown into war once again. An army of Slimes and Mimics, creatures thought weak and beyond concern, rose up and sieged war against the world. Humanity was powerless to stop them and faced extinction. However, six Demi-Fauna rose up and, using magic they learned in secret, defeated the Slime-Mimic armies, slaying the Mimic Queen and driving the Slime Queen into hiding. </p><p> </p><p>With the Slime-Mimic war won, the 6 Demi-Fauna heroines were knighted as Dames and given rewards for their valiant efforts. With the prestige of the 6 Dames, many Demi-Fauna saw life improve. Many Demi-Fauna, especially those similar to the Dames, found themselves welcomed to live their lives in peace and seek their own happiness. The magic ban was also lifted due to the important role magic played in the fight against the Slime-Mimic armies.</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593475796/oc3kxysw8jqvepeetdii.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593475817/lk5rfah7scscjdl9mvn5.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1592530959/ddwop0eu3tqtdzcqz4yp.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593475848/ky6vuj90fq93klusrh0x.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593475886/clbwgeee1fv01oepvkjb.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593475906/uglmao4fb6kigstoycp6.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593475937/bit9rqplojfzp0hizej3.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593475966/s6nh0n2c4bs2zhvedicz.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593475988/pslcwgmexinfe4chnbni.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593476007/gjjop2ui4ui7jdiwrntt.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1592530700/lmundl90z0fpq0prsfjy.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1598554777/byniedakuvnpvhmpk2lt.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599057880/fa3bmvxqhfagyntb3lyx.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1599923569/vlt3eu9tar9ylyeszprb.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601417554/u8t4zdottaszx6b8uj4b.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1601938550/mwii2gyw2ltbya7xjiab.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593476231/usjbuj4fcji72gzqhs5d.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593476253/gedaygmhwr1hasxeaune.png"" src=""""/><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1593476286/mmg9ataj79k7m4kg1puk.png"" src=""""/></p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1592541860/ejuopvscsgknu4k8nugi.png"" src=""""/></p><p>Please note that shipping costs are <strong>NOT</strong>  included in the prices and will be charged after the campaign is over.

<p>As a new player, DM and a Neurodivergent player - I struggle to remember all the finer details of the game, and from both sides of the DM screen it makes life easier if everyone can see the rules quickly and easily - no flipping through a bulky Player Handbook!</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Too much time on remembering rules?</strong></h2>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1571574139/ssafhlb8dmbzen40pmut.png"" src=""""/></p>

</h2>
<p>I found that due to inexperience of new players, and things like Object Permanence issues, Short Term Memory loss and concentration problems that can come with Neurodiversities - Cheat Sheets got forgotten, or lost among the chaos of the gaming table, and went unused - leaving ""Can I do this, How does this work, Oh man am I dead?"" to be common utterances at the table.</p>
<p>And so, the Player Screen was born.</p>
<p>For this first version of the Player Screen I went with the most important and universally relevant information regardless of Race or Class.</p>

<p>Currently, I've limited rewards to 1000pcs for the initial print run, but if we smash the goals I will add more!!</p>
</div><div>
<p>With this project, the art is finished, samples have been ordered and look great!.<br/>The only risks we foresee is possible slight delays at port when the boxes of screens arrive, and individual postal services in your country of destination.<br/>Shipping from Australia can be expensive, so I've only added a handful of countries - If yours isn't there let me know and I can work out the shipping costs and add it to the campaign!</p>
<p>All parcels will be shipped with basic tracking as standard.</p>
<p>I've worked very hard to make this project the best it can possibly be, and I am using the best services i have available within my budget to ensure they get to you!</p>

<p>The Shrouded Crypt: A Spooky One-Shot Adventure!<br/>To celebrate all this, I teamed up with Nadia from Go Play Brisbane and Shared Sagas Podcast to create a custom adventure centered around my spooky set of Paper Minis and a basic plotline that we put our heads together on, that she turned into an INCREDIBLE adventure that all backer get a digital copy of the module.</p>
<p><u>All backers get a BETA copy of the adventure AND the minis!</u><br/>If you tuned in for our Launch Party you've seen the adventure and hopefully want to run it for your group!</p>
<p>One of our Stretch Goals is to produce a full edited and laid out version of the adventure which all backers will receive 3 months before anybody else does!!</p>

</div></div>","The 5e Player Screen was born of necessity.

As a new player, DM and a Neurodivergent player - I struggle to remember all the finer details of the game, and from both sides of the DM screen it makes life easier if everyone can see the rules quickly and easily - no flipping through a bulky Player Handbook!
 
Too much time on remembering rules?

Problem solved!

I found that due to inexperience of new players, and things like Object Permanence issues, Short Term Memory loss and concentration problems that can come with Neurodiversities - Cheat Sheets got forgotten, or lost among the chaos of the gaming table, and went unused - leaving ""Can I do this, How does this work, Oh man am I dead?"" to be common utterances at the table.
And so, the Player Screen was born.
For this first version of the Player Screen I went with the most important and universally relevant information regardless of Race or Class.
Krystina Arielle reviews the 5E Player Screen prototype!


Looking at the prototype of the #dnd 5E screen by @ShaunSunday_Art now crowdfunding on indiegogo https://www.indie https://t.co/C6P2hEJ4iO— Krystina Arielle ? (@KrystinaArielle) October 30, 2019


Krystina took her screen to be in the Library Bards new music video!So cool!!

Dungeon Masters Forge does a great review of the Player Screen!
https://twitter.com/DMsForge/status/11947437143...

Picked up mail today and RAN home because I knew what was in it! If you haven't seen this, you need to check out the #DnD5e Player Screens by @ShaunSunday_Art. Love the idea, art, and execution, and this is just a prototype ? 
 
The left hand panel features the things you can do on your turn, and a reminder to TRY ANYTHING! - It's a collaborative game, the DM has the last say, but the sky is the limit!
The center panel has the experience points/level up table, Death Saves and how they work, as well as Darkvision, Currency Conversion and Exhaustion.
The right hand panel has a list of conditions and how they apply to you - Poisoned/Petrified/Invisble etc.
The front of the screen features art of a ferocious mimic by me!
The screen is really low profile - 148mm x 630mm (3 x A5 size panels) - so this means you aren't hidden from the DM and can roll over or beside the screen with ease.
It's made with a sturdy 2.8mm chipboard, UV printed with a laminated coating - so it's just like a proper DM screen in weight and quality!

Currently, I've limited rewards to 1000pcs for the initial print run, but if we smash the goals I will add more!!

With this project, the art is finished, samples have been ordered and look great!.The only risks we foresee is possible slight delays at port when the boxes of screens arrive, and individual postal services in your country of destination.Shipping from Australia can be expensive, so I've only added a handful of countries - If yours isn't there let me know and I can work out the shipping costs and add it to the campaign!
All parcels will be shipped with basic tracking as standard.
I've worked very hard to make this project the best it can possibly be, and I am using the best services i have available within my budget to ensure they get to you!

<p>Beset at sea! Curse-infected pirates strike at the characters, seeking blood and valuables on the waves. Can the beleaguered adventurers repel the attack and root out the source of demonic piracy in these waters?<br/><br/>Curse of Blood Lagoon features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sailing, broadsides, and boarding parties!</li>
<li>Cursed pirates!</li>
<li>Several hooks that can bring player characters to the adventure</li>
<li>“The Isle of the Sea God’s Lament”, to which any island in The Lost Lands (or in your campaign) can play host</li>

<p>Casey W. Christofferson has written a fantastic new island-adventure set in the seas of the Lost Lands. Recommended for 4-6 characters of levels 4-5, Curse of Blood Lagoon brings swashbuckling, cannon fire(!), infectious pirates, undead, and a chance to reverse a curse to your gaming table.</p>

<h3>The Project </h3>
<p><a href=""https://www.froggodgames.com/product-category/uncategorized/d20-33-5/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Necromancer Games</a> projects on Indiegogo are simple, focused, and short.</p>
<ul>
<li>Short in duration (2-3 weeks)</li>
<li>Fast delivery of PDF once funding is completed</li>
<li>Limited to a single title</li>
<li>Have options priced between $5-$30</li>
<li>Stretch goals and project bonuses (if any) affect the principle reward only (usually both the PDF and the softcover).</li>
<li>Are the only guaranteed method to get the premium* print copy (NOTE: the softcover versions  in this printing will not be sold on our website: see FAQ for explanation).</li>
<li>Have a simple fulfillment process that does not use Backerkit</li>
</ul>
<p>*Premium means heavyweight glossy interior pages enhancing the art and color elements. The  thick, glossy cardstock brings out the vibrant color of the cover illustration. These are the nicest softcover books we have ever sold and we only print a title this way once.</p>
<p>Any reprint would use print on demand service that, although nice, do not approach the quality of our INDIEGOGO funded books.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613857642/jwrcmuxztbej3mydzbwb.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p><strong>Why the Tiny Print Run?</strong></p>
<p>Since 2012 our crowdfunding approach has been extravagant in every way. Ambitious with massive page counts, plus numerous add-on options and stretch goals. All supporting a primary title itself as many as 990 pages.</p>
<p>This has resulted in Kickstarter's with memorable pledge rewards that include top-quality hardcover books with sometimes dozens of stretch goal bonuses and add-on extras. These are awesome AND they are expensive to buy for customers like you because they are very expensive to make for publishers like us.</p>
<p><strong>Why not use Kickstarter?</strong></p>
<p>We will still be using Kickstarter, frequently, for our large-scale projects, but we hear the request for less expensive options for our products all the time, especially smaller, faster-paced adventures that can be completed in 2-3 sessions.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613857679/du1bjyty2p68gt6xbmui.png"" src=""""/></p>
<h3>Product enhancements tied to project success </h3>
<p>During the funding period for Blood Lagoon and after the funding goal is met we will  improve the delivered product based on additional sales. There are no special tiered collectors editions or add-on purchase extras. Thus, as total project funding increases, the better the final product will be for everybody.</p>
<p>Examples of improvements made to earlier products:</p>
<ul>
<li>Additional commissions for interior color art specific to the adventure. </li>
<li>The previous Indiegogo project added 2 interior art pieces and 3 extra creature illustrations for its appendix.</li>
<li>Downloadable Options designed for popular virtual table-top software (The rewards for both How Orcus Stole Christmas! and In Vino Gigantus included the new creature/NPC tokens and player maps). </li>
<li>High-resolution files of illustrations to share with players at the table.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Project Delivery</h3>

</div></div>","Beset at sea! Curse-infected pirates strike at the characters, seeking blood and valuables on the waves. Can the beleaguered adventurers repel the attack and root out the source of demonic piracy in these waters?Curse of Blood Lagoon features:

Sailing, broadsides, and boarding parties!
Cursed pirates!
Several hooks that can bring player characters to the adventure
“The Isle of the Sea God’s Lament”, to which any island in The Lost Lands (or in your campaign) can play host
Zombie pirates!
A variety of monsters and a curse to avoid!
Rum!
Refugees to rescue!
Crazy fruit!

Casey W. Christofferson has written a fantastic new island-adventure set in the seas of the Lost Lands. Recommended for 4-6 characters of levels 4-5, Curse of Blood Lagoon brings swashbuckling, cannon fire(!), infectious pirates, undead, and a chance to reverse a curse to your gaming table.

The Project 
Necromancer Games projects on Indiegogo are simple, focused, and short.

Short in duration (2-3 weeks)
Fast delivery of PDF once funding is completed
Limited to a single title
Have options priced between $5-$30
Stretch goals and project bonuses (if any) affect the principle reward only (usually both the PDF and the softcover).
Are the only guaranteed method to get the premium* print copy (NOTE: the softcover versions  in this printing will not be sold on our website: see FAQ for explanation).
Have a simple fulfillment process that does not use Backerkit

*Premium means heavyweight glossy interior pages enhancing the art and color elements. The  thick, glossy cardstock brings out the vibrant color of the cover illustration. These are the nicest softcover books we have ever sold and we only print a title this way once.
Any reprint would use print on demand service that, although nice, do not approach the quality of our INDIEGOGO funded books.

Why the Tiny Print Run?
Since 2012 our crowdfunding approach has been extravagant in every way. Ambitious with massive page counts, plus numerous add-on options and stretch goals. All supporting a primary title itself as many as 990 pages.
This has resulted in Kickstarter's with memorable pledge rewards that include top-quality hardcover books with sometimes dozens of stretch goal bonuses and add-on extras. These are awesome AND they are expensive to buy for customers like you because they are very expensive to make for publishers like us.
Why not use Kickstarter?
We will still be using Kickstarter, frequently, for our large-scale projects, but we hear the request for less expensive options for our products all the time, especially smaller, faster-paced adventures that can be completed in 2-3 sessions.

Product enhancements tied to project success 
During the funding period for Blood Lagoon and after the funding goal is met we will  improve the delivered product based on additional sales. There are no special tiered collectors editions or add-on purchase extras. Thus, as total project funding increases, the better the final product will be for everybody.
Examples of improvements made to earlier products:

Additional commissions for interior color art specific to the adventure. 
The previous Indiegogo project added 2 interior art pieces and 3 extra creature illustrations for its appendix.
Downloadable Options designed for popular virtual table-top software (The rewards for both How Orcus Stole Christmas! and In Vino Gigantus included the new creature/NPC tokens and player maps). 
High-resolution files of illustrations to share with players at the table.

<p>This adventure is designed for a group of 4-6 characters of levels 5-7 playing the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. While functional as a standalone module, this adventure is designed to be the first adventure in a series exploring the workings and reasons of a deity of the Lost Lands referred to as the Nameless One and her most faithful servant, “the Walking Stick Man” as they try to recover ancient words of power and stir forces lost and forgotten.<br/>This adventure starts in the settlement of Chesmire, though can be moved around with little difficulty and placed in any campaign world with only minor changes, namely the addition or use of an ancient lost or near lost pantheon. The reason for the placement in this area is easy access to the adventure “Sorcerer’s Citadel” from Quests of Doom, which should be played following the events of the second adventure in this series as a return to the feelings of normalcy while still maintaining references to the ancient pantheon on which these adventures are focused via the statue of Mocham.</p>
<h3>Adventure Summary</h3>Long ago, the neolithic pantheon was the primary pantheon and Dagon was not yet a demon lord. This was a time of great power, when gods still spoke the Language Eternal freely and rewrote reality as they saw fit. Dagon had many coastal temples, such as this one, that over the millennia have sank beneath the surface taking their priesthood with them. As Dagon fell, so did the priests that still venerated him in these sunken temples. Those devout enough received blessings on sacred relics within the temples to adapt them to their new home. The blessing to do such at this temple was twofold as Dagon bestowed upon the Eye of Dagon, a 5,000 gp diamond that was kept on display in this temple, the ability for them to survive underwater and upon the temple walls itself he granted the power to <strong>SUSTAIN</strong>. The temple has been found a few times over the years, most notably by a Xill seeking a safe nest and a Xorn who arrived drawn to and seeking to devour the Eye of Dagon, but it has remained untouched by human hands since Dagon, and the temple, fell.<br/>A few weeks ago, a shopkeeper named Tryn was expanding her underground storerooms on the edge of town and broke into this ancient temple beneath the town. The laborers she hired vanished with screams as the passage opened, leaving Tryn to report the incident to Elder l Sabratha who sent for adventurers from Port Manden and placed militia to prevent anyone or anything from entering or leaving the business.<br/>After arriving in town, the characters are intercepted by an older man who appears blind with a walking stick before they get to Elder Sabratha. He requests they retrieve an ancient tablet from the dungeon that they are headed to and offers some odd items in return. Elder Sabratha arranges payment with the characters for clearing and securing the area but does not know the walking stick man if asked.<br/>Inside the tunnels, warnings are scrawled on the walls despite no one entering. As the characters plunge farther in, they face off against aberrations and find objects unseen for centuries that are being activated in ways unused by modern society. Upon returning to the surface, the walking stick man is waiting in the house for them to retrieve the tablet and make good on his offers. The guards do not recall anyone entering other than the party if asked. Elder Sabratha is ready with payment in town and offers the party to stay the night with her to recover before setting out again. In the morning, Tryn offers a 10% discount on all items in her shop for the next week to the characters, if nothing was stolen from her of course.<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1612910098/vbh2vhho021zhbjllvcz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p><strong>Barbarian - Oath of the Black River</strong></p>
<p>You have drunk of the waters of the Black Rivers, and now you serve as one of its many avatars. While one day you will die and be called to cross it to the afterlifes, no one, neither living or dead, shall escape your grasp.</p>
<p><strong>Bard - College of Siday</strong></p>
<p>The Sidays of your people fuel your storytelling and enhance your songs. As a keeper of the legends who have come before, it is your duty to preserve them for future generations, and to make new ones with your allies as you face dangers worthy of song.</p>
<p><strong>Cleric - Volcano Domain</strong></p>
<p>The awe-inspiring power of the volcano fills you. Life granting. Land breaking. Whether you face heroes or villains, mortal race, land spirit or vicious monster, show them the wrath of the fiery mountains as you bring it crashing down on them.</p>
<p><strong>Druid - Circle of Tides</strong></p>
<p>The tide has called to you, and you have taken its teachings into you. Eternal, ceaseless rhythms crashing upon the shore are your symbol, and whether they bring loved ones home, or break the will of iron willed sailors, it matters not. Through the tide, all will know balance.</p>
<p><strong>Fighter - Kawal</strong></p>
<p>It is not enough to simply be hit once, but to stand strong against the second. It is not enough for you to simply be at the battle, but to drive all harm away from your allies. Your enemies are not enough to stop you. And through your discipline, they will not even slow you.</p>
<p><strong>Monk - Way of Kaluluwa</strong></p>
<p>If a mortal is made of spirit and body, to learn the art of one or the other leaves you half complete. To learn both would be hard, but would leave you whole. Fight not as one, but as two, as you rain the power of physical and spiritual might down upon your enemies.</p>
<p><strong>Paladin - Oath of Blood</strong></p>
<p>Blood is what binds one soul to another, what binds one soul to a purpose, what binds one soul to a people. To what ends, it matters not. To what justice or injustice it may bring, it matters not. It is through your sacrifice, through your blade, that will see your chosen loyalty bear the fruit of victory.</p>
<p><strong>Ranger - Mangangayaw</strong></p>
<p>In the open sea, you have trained to turn any misstep, any mistake, any flaw found in your opponent into your key to victory. An ambush is no stranger to your repetoire of tactics, but it is through the constant rhythm of the fight, and taking joy in the folly of your foes, where you find yourself most at home.</p>
<p><strong>Rogue - Graverobber</strong></p>
<p>You were warned plenty of times about the dangers of theft this vile, but you knew you had all the world to gain by ripping a necklace or a weapon from a corpse who could no longer use it. Bad luck on your part that the first few things came with curses. Even worse luck for others when those curses became your boons.</p>
<p><strong>Sorcerer - Diwata Bloodline</strong></p>
<p>Be it birth, blessing, or luck, you possess in you the lifeblood of nature, granting you extraordinary sorcerery. No matter the reason, you are marked as being one of the spirits who make up the world. And in time, perhaps you can command power that so many venerate and fear.</p>
<p><strong>Warlock - Moon Eater Patron</strong></p>
<p>You have taken a bargain of power with one of the five great and terrible monsters who inhabit this world. From them, you have found power in their great malice. And through them, you have gained access to power to destroy, kill, and rend the heavens themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Wizard - Mentala</strong></p>
<p>You have discovered newfound power in the language of magic. In those arcane sigils you have discovered greater steps of power, and have devoted yourself to mastering them. You seek not to master one school or another, but to master the act of containing great magic, and letting it loose in new and devastating ways.</p>

<h3>Why fund Sina Una specifically?</h3>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Sina Una has been largely inspired by three main factors. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">First, there has been a call for more diverse themes in tabletop gaming, which has only grown in recent years. By representing these cultures and mythos respectfully we can start to expand our idea of fantasy and what that word means when we create worlds and characters. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">The second is to become an easy to access compendium for all of our research on precolonial Philippine mythology, as sourcebooks on the subject are few and far between. Not only will this allow TTRPG players to have a reference for another world to play in, but those interested in the concept of precolonial Philippine mythology will have a master list for every sourcebook we learned and took from.</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-family: benton-sans, Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;"">Which brings us to our third and main inspiration: a connection for Filipinos to find themselves in a heritage somewhat lost to time, and to feel comfort in playing a character that reflects that discovery. This book creates a piece at tables that makes inclusivity in gaming more tangible.</span></p>
<p>Filipino mythology is largely forgotten, with it being mostly passed by oral tradition and then swept under the rug by colonization. Most sources for it are also easily accessible only in the Philippines and we’re trying to bring them all over the world. Sina Una means “those who came first,” a homage to the fact all sources from this book are pulled from precolonial Philippines, honoring the indigenous people of the islands and shining a spotlight on their beautiful tales.</p>
<h3>Where is funding going?</h3>
<p>Main amounts of funding will go to paying our writers and ourselves for the time and effort it takes to research the source material to then fuse with fantasy. This allows the book to continue being made in high morale, meaning content inside will be written with the best intentions. The rest of the funding will go to properly format pages for layout, and shipping and handling.</p>

<p><strong>$50000 - Third Goal</strong></p>

We will also be adding in one more magic item and one more spell in our book.</p>

<p>The Islands of Sina Una is a project spearheaded by Lucia Versprille, the founder of Monstrous Incantation (@M_Incantation). After discovering inspiration in old mythology from her heritage, she began to seek out more information about stories and mythos from the Philippines. Eventually leading to directing a team of other interested artists, writers, and players.</p>
<p>Soon after Joshua Mendenhall or (@HTTPaladin) was sought out, beginning as the main graphic designer and layout artist for the book. Quickly though, his longtime passion for TTRPG shone through in his strength with mechanics and storytelling, and Lucia appointed him Co-Director.</p>

Barbarian - Oath of the Black River
You have drunk of the waters of the Black Rivers, and now you serve as one of its many avatars. While one day you will die and be called to cross it to the afterlifes, no one, neither living or dead, shall escape your grasp.
Bard - College of Siday
The Sidays of your people fuel your storytelling and enhance your songs. As a keeper of the legends who have come before, it is your duty to preserve them for future generations, and to make new ones with your allies as you face dangers worthy of song.
Cleric - Volcano Domain
The awe-inspiring power of the volcano fills you. Life granting. Land breaking. Whether you face heroes or villains, mortal race, land spirit or vicious monster, show them the wrath of the fiery mountains as you bring it crashing down on them.
Druid - Circle of Tides
The tide has called to you, and you have taken its teachings into you. Eternal, ceaseless rhythms crashing upon the shore are your symbol, and whether they bring loved ones home, or break the will of iron willed sailors, it matters not. Through the tide, all will know balance.
Fighter - Kawal
It is not enough to simply be hit once, but to stand strong against the second. It is not enough for you to simply be at the battle, but to drive all harm away from your allies. Your enemies are not enough to stop you. And through your discipline, they will not even slow you.
Monk - Way of Kaluluwa
If a mortal is made of spirit and body, to learn the art of one or the other leaves you half complete. To learn both would be hard, but would leave you whole. Fight not as one, but as two, as you rain the power of physical and spiritual might down upon your enemies.
Paladin - Oath of Blood
Blood is what binds one soul to another, what binds one soul to a purpose, what binds one soul to a people. To what ends, it matters not. To what justice or injustice it may bring, it matters not. It is through your sacrifice, through your blade, that will see your chosen loyalty bear the fruit of victory.
Ranger - Mangangayaw
In the open sea, you have trained to turn any misstep, any mistake, any flaw found in your opponent into your key to victory. An ambush is no stranger to your repetoire of tactics, but it is through the constant rhythm of the fight, and taking joy in the folly of your foes, where you find yourself most at home.
Rogue - Graverobber
You were warned plenty of times about the dangers of theft this vile, but you knew you had all the world to gain by ripping a necklace or a weapon from a corpse who could no longer use it. Bad luck on your part that the first few things came with curses. Even worse luck for others when those curses became your boons.
Sorcerer - Diwata Bloodline
Be it birth, blessing, or luck, you possess in you the lifeblood of nature, granting you extraordinary sorcerery. No matter the reason, you are marked as being one of the spirits who make up the world. And in time, perhaps you can command power that so many venerate and fear.
Warlock - Moon Eater Patron
You have taken a bargain of power with one of the five great and terrible monsters who inhabit this world. From them, you have found power in their great malice. And through them, you have gained access to power to destroy, kill, and rend the heavens themselves.
Wizard - Mentala
You have discovered newfound power in the language of magic. In those arcane sigils you have discovered greater steps of power, and have devoted yourself to mastering them. You seek not to master one school or another, but to master the act of containing great magic, and letting it loose in new and devastating ways.

enquiries welcome.     Above: A sample set of 10x Mixed Theme Sprues, painted by Golem Painting Studio. The panels are 5cm x 5cm in dimension, and are reversible so as to have ""wall"" details on the front sides, and ""roof"" details on the rear sides of the panels.  What We Need & What You GetOur plastic terrain kits in this funding campaign are intended to be compatible with a wide range of small scale Tabletop Wargames and Tabletop Roleplay games, primarily scales of between 6mm and 15mm.At 6mm scale, the buildings that can be constructed represent grand cathedrals and awesome mega-arcologies, whilst at 15mm scale the buildings represent more conventional gothic style buildings and industrial units.We have already created a prototype plastic mould to test the tooling company we intend to use to produce the rest of our plastic scenery range, and have established that they are capable of the quality we require, with a fast turnaround time (it took just 3 weeks to produce the prototype mould tool).We have many designs for more plastic scenery pieces already sculpted, but without a crowdfunding campaign it would be too expensive for us to afford to put them all into production, so your interest and support at this stage means we can bring many more designs and themes to retail... and your gaming tables!So, as we cross stretch goals, we'll be unlocking more models, some of which can be seen below... The Terrain KitsNote that we can still take feedback on the stretch goal scenery designs in this crowdfunding campaign, so we can (if customers request) modify the sculpts by adding different details (etc) before they are cast up and sent out.Stretch Goal #4 also involves adding more details to the currently featureless sides of two of the panels on the Mixed Theme Sprue - again, the specific details put on those panels could be modified on requests from project backers.   Above: Ten Mixed Theme Sprues  Above: Scenery panels used with 15mm scale models. Above: Scenery panels used with 6mm scale giant robot models. Above: Scenery panels used with 6mm scale vehicle, aircraft and infantry models. Above: Scenery panels chopped up to make ruins.  Initial Offering -

<p>Hanging on by a thread. You snuck past a giant spider along the way but now want to arm yourself, hearing monsters ahead. You need some wood for a sturdy club.</p>
<div data-id=""20520094""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1530807271/opcybqpg0zilk0xdweyh.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>You could gather your strength at a shrine or distract the feasting goblinoids to steal their food. No wood that you wanted, but you’ll use the shrine – hunger isn’t the biggest threat to your survival now.</p>

<p>Finally, some wood! You could fashion a weapon from these branches. But you are weak – gathering the wood, then crafting the club would tire you out. Instead you decide to rest up and to face the upcoming monster with your bare hands.</p>
<div data-id=""20520125""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1530807276/pbriyouvmrhh76jsox6l.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>You are short on time – another encounter could yield resources, but if time gets to 0 the monster would ambush you. You decide not to risk it and face the monster.</p>

<p>You face your foe. The unfortunate wretch trapped in these caverns has long gone mad with despair.</p>
<p>Your gamble not making a weapon paid off! The Survivor’s Special effect would disarm you, wasting all resources you would have spent on the weapon.</p>
<p>You didn’t have to go into the fight blindly – you could Scout the monster and knew what to expect. It would cost resources but would provide certainty.</p>

<p>In Combat you will spend effort to wound your enemy. Good thing you feel strong after stopping at that shrine!<br/><br/>You would be in trouble encountering an armoured monster - dealing with that using just your fists would lead to a quick defeat.</p>

<p>Unbroken has been designed to be played regardless of how strapped for time or company you might be. All you need to get it to the table is a small space, 20-30 minutes of free time and just one player - YOU. </p>
<div data-id=""20591414""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1530807280/suisouivifpa0et8aajq.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>Some games have add-on solo modes. Some allow you to play versus a virtual opponent. Unbroken doesn’t settle for the fact that you’re playing solo - it celebrates it. The survival story you’re telling is that of individual triumph in the face of adversity, and it has been crafted to be enjoyed in exactly this way.</p>
<div data-id=""20591423""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1530807281/rvptn7r3pjov1mw3fa78.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>Unbroken is won by careful planning and calculated risk. There are several strategies you can go for including a focus on skills, trickery or different weapon upgrade trees. Your approach will determine your success much more than the limited luck element. Every game you will learn how to best prepare for the challenges of the dungeon. Every next game you will be a little better at surviving. </p>
<div data-id=""20591453""><figure style=""margin: 0px;""><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://indiegogo-media-prod-cld-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1530807282/dlgppaid9qoj0kvgh7qx.jpg"" src=""""/></figure></div>
<p>Do you spend your resources to find out more about the coming dangers or do you hedge your bets and go in blind? Do you risk looking for food to not starve even if you might be ambushed by a monster? There are many difficult decisions in Unbroken and these will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering if you made the right one. </p>

</div></div>","Test your survival skills in the dark fantasy world of Unbroken. You are the only one left alive after your group was ambushed by monsters - now you must avenge your friends and reclaim your freedom. Quick to learn, easy to set up and playable in a brief 20-30 minutes, the game will challenge you to make the right decisions or fall victim to the many dangers of the monster-infested caverns.Plan wisely and take calculated risks - you do not have much and must use every resource at your disposal to prevail. Each journey in the dark is unique as you play as one of four different characters and face a variety of monsters and encounters. Your character gets better with experience and so will you - Unbroken is a game that encourages and rewards repeated plays to refine your strategies.                                               
 
 
 
 
             
 





Hanging on by a thread. You snuck past a giant spider along the way but now want to arm yourself, hearing monsters ahead. You need some wood for a sturdy club.

You could gather your strength at a shrine or distract the feasting goblinoids to steal their food. No wood that you wanted, but you’ll use the shrine – hunger isn’t the biggest threat to your survival now.

Still a bit of time left - you push on, looking for another encounter.

Finally, some wood! You could fashion a weapon from these branches. But you are weak – gathering the wood, then crafting the club would tire you out. Instead you decide to rest up and to face the upcoming monster with your bare hands.

You are short on time – another encounter could yield resources, but if time gets to 0 the monster would ambush you. You decide not to risk it and face the monster.

You face your foe. The unfortunate wretch trapped in these caverns has long gone mad with despair.
Your gamble not making a weapon paid off! The Survivor’s Special effect would disarm you, wasting all resources you would have spent on the weapon.
You didn’t have to go into the fight blindly – you could Scout the monster and knew what to expect. It would cost resources but would provide certainty.

In Combat you will spend effort to wound your enemy. Good thing you feel strong after stopping at that shrine!You would be in trouble encountering an armoured monster - dealing with that using just your fists would lead to a quick defeat.

Your victory is rewarded! Which weapon upgrade tree will you choose? Which skills will aid your struggles? There are two more truly dangerous monsters to defeat before you are free of this accursed place!


Unbroken has been designed to be played regardless of how strapped for time or company you might be. All you need to get it to the table is a small space, 20-30 minutes of free time and just one player - YOU. 

Some games have add-on solo modes. Some allow you to play versus a virtual opponent. Unbroken doesn’t settle for the fact that you’re playing solo - it celebrates it. The survival story you’re telling is that of individual triumph in the face of adversity, and it has been crafted to be enjoyed in exactly this way.

Unbroken is won by careful planning and calculated risk. There are several strategies you can go for including a focus on skills, trickery or different weapon upgrade trees. Your approach will determine your success much more than the limited luck element. Every game you will learn how to best prepare for the challenges of the dungeon. Every next game you will be a little better at surviving. 

Do you spend your resources to find out more about the coming dangers or do you hedge your bets and go in blind? Do you risk looking for food to not starve even if you might be ambushed by a monster? There are many difficult decisions in Unbroken and these will keep you on the edge of your seat wondering if you made the right one. 

Unbroken is built on a flexible system that is centered around a variety of characters to play and monsters to combat. We already have great designs in mind for expansions that we will start working on in full after the campaign. We can’t wait to have the community’s input on the new content! 

We are so certain that you will like Unbroken that we are happy to offer an unconditional full refund (including shipping) within 30 days of you receiving the game. Go ahead, dive in. We know you will love it!

Not only will you help the site, but you'll also receive membership privileges and a bunch of great roleplaying PDFs!RPGnet is the top independent web site for tabletop roleplaying games. The heart of our site is one of the most talked-about forums in the industry — with 12,000 active members and 19 million posts. We also publish several gaming reviews every week and a few columns. Finally, we maintain a constantly expanding catalog of roleplaying products that currently indexes 20,000 games and supplements, 2,000 magazines, and 36,000 articles.All of this costs money, so in 2013 we decided to turn to crowdfunding to encourage readers to become members, to support the site. The drive was successful, so we've turned into a yearly tradition.In years past, the membership drive has enabled us to restore the search function, move the machines to a cloud platform, revise our reviews system, improve review browsing, enhance mobile access, improve security, and upgrade column tagging.This year, we've got a variety of awesome PDFs thanks to our generous product sponsors:

The Well, from Shoeless Pete Games.

They Came from Beneath the Sea! and Pugmire: Pan's Guide for New Pioneers from Onyx Path Publishing.

Princess of the Universe, from Fantasy Heartbreaker.

Colonial Gothic and Fairyland, from Rogue Games.

TimeWatch, from Pelgrane Press.

Though ads and affiliations pay some of our costs, we are picky about which ads and ad networks we use, so that we can maintain high-quality ads that are likely to be of interest and that won't distract (or annoy!) our readers. We've opted out of high-value ads that include audio, that expand, or that are placed as interstitials between pages. We forbid dating ads, gambling ads, gold-farming ads, political ads, and certain other categories of advertising. As a result, we occasionally ask RPGnet readers to become members, in order to help support the community.

And you must be quick, because the Necromancer is stirring again, and the Fate of Ventar, the real one, is yet to come! An Old School SettingEverything you’ll find in Tyrnador screams “old school”.The latest iteration of the Savage Worlds rules were fine-tuned and adapted, where necessary, to give you the perfect high fantasy dungeon-crawling experience.In this game you’ll find dozens of Edges, gear, spells and a handful of setting rules specifically tailored for this goal.But Tyrnador isn’t just about dungeon crawling (or hex-crawling in the wilderness): the setting is very flexible and can be used for more narrative adventures and investigative scenarios if you want.The setting is also designed to handle high-level games, with a simple but robust Stronghold management system, which begins to be useful very early in the adventurers’ lives, and extensive rules for crafting and magical research.So… a lot of stuff packed into a few pages!You can download a free Quickstart for Tyrnador here! This game references the Savage Worlds game system, available from Pinnacle Entertainment Group at www.peginc.com.

Every card is meticulously designed, carefully illustrated, and packaged into a fun custom design tuck box.Above picture shows a closeup of the 3 BREW METERS (left) and brew timeline (far right).

I’m Jan Van Damme, the creator of Mob Treasure. Making this book allowed me to combine my love of treasure hunts, history, mythology, interactive narratives and mysteries. The idea came from a rare treasure hunters journal that I was lucky to get a hold of. The manuscript contained maps, letters and descriptions of “visions” the author had about the lost money of Dutch Schultz. As many before me, I caught the treasure hunting bug. I searched for clues in newspaper microfilms from 1935 at a library. </p><p>     For Mob Treasure, I captured the gritty look and feel of the historical ephemera. The puzzles and story convey the excitement I felt during my personal hunt. With seasoned escape room designers and talented artists on board, we're bringing this legend back to life in puzzle book form. I'm proud of what we've created, and are excited to bring you the thrills that Mob Treasure has to offer. Your contribution will fund the changes, updates and tweaks needed for completion. </p><p>     Please share this project with your friends on your socials. Thanks! </p></div>","The missing treasure of New York City beer baron Dutch Schultz has captivated countless treasure hunters.

I’m Jan Van Damme, the creator of Mob Treasure. Making this book allowed me to combine my love of treasure hunts, history, mythology, interactive narratives and mysteries. The idea came from a rare treasure hunters journal that I was lucky to get a hold of. The manuscript contained maps, letters and descriptions of “visions” the author had about the lost money of Dutch Schultz. As many before me, I caught the treasure hunting bug. I searched for clues in newspaper microfilms from 1935 at a library.      For Mob Treasure, I captured the gritty look and feel of the historical ephemera. The puzzles and story convey the excitement I felt during my personal hunt. With seasoned escape room designers and talented artists on board, we're bringing this legend back to life in puzzle book form. I'm proud of what we've created, and are excited to bring you the thrills that Mob Treasure has to offer. Your contribution will fund the changes, updates and tweaks needed for completion.      Please share this project with your friends on your socials. Thanks!",7.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Summary</h3>

<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>

<h3>Introducing new battlemap creation software for tabletop RPGs</h3>
<p>Have you always wanted to make your own slick-looking full-color battlemaps, but just don’t have the time or patience to learn to use a sophisticated image editing application like Photoshop or Gimp? Or perhaps you tried anyway but found it too difficult and/or time-consuming?</p>
<p>Have you tried existing mapping software and been frustrated with the learning curve, the cost, the interface, and/or been disappointed by the results?</p>
<p>If the answer to any or all of those questions is “yes”, then my brand new MapForge application is probably just what you’ve been searching for.</p>
<h3>What makes MapForge special?</h3>
<p><strong>Easy to use</strong></p>
<p>MapForge will be very easy to use. A GM should be able to start making maps on Day 1 after watching a brief tutorial video, without even bothering to read the User Manual. By extension, they should never feel like they need to re-learn the software, even if it’s been many months since they last used it.</p>
<p><strong>Support for Add-Ons (both free and commercial)</strong></p>
<p>Make your maps using top-notch professional Add-On content, or using your own content, or a mix of both.</p>
<p><strong>Low-cost/Inexpensive</strong></p>
<p>I’m making the software itself very affordable, so that you’ll have plenty of money left over to purchase a good selection of content Add-Ons.</p>
<p><strong>Versatile</strong></p>
<p>Although it’s primarily intended for creating battlemaps (in any genre), the program will provide enough flexibility that, given the right content, you’ll also be able to create other types of maps, ranging from area maps to deep space. You can use the software to make high-resolution maps for printing, or lower-resolution maps for use in your favorite <a href=""http://battlegroundsgames.com/links/#anchor6"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">virtual tabletop software</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Gorgeous and user-friendly interface</strong></p>
<p>The user interface for MapForge is thematically generic, but very attractive and modern. And it should appeal to you whether you’re the type who prefers to click on buttons and choose menu commands to get things done, or of you’re the power-user type who likes to use hotkeys to get things done that much quicker.</p>
<p><strong>Cross-platform</strong></p>
<p>Whether you’re a Windows user or a Mac user, MapForge has you covered. And if you have a MapForge license and someday decide to switch platforms, you can just request a new license code for the new operating system, free of charge.</p>
<p><strong>High-quality results</strong></p>
<p>The output is crisp, detailed, and (optionally) high-resolution. Many of the image filter effects produce results that are indistinguishable from high-end image editing software such as Photoshop.</p>
<p><strong>Empowering, but with a shallow learning curve</strong></p>
<p>MapForge will help you unleash your creativity. It’s not intended just for the artistically or technically gifted. It will allow anyone, regardless of their art skills or technical skills (or lack thereof), to create gorgeous, detailed battlemaps. With MapForge, you’ll be able to produce Photoshop-like effects such as bevels, drop-shadows, strokes, glows, blurs, and color adjustments without the steep learning curve that producing such effects normally requires.</p>
<p><strong>Offers a free level of use</strong></p>
<p>You’ll be able to use MapForge to make nice maps even if you haven’t purchased a license. Even use free and commercial Add-Ons without a license (though commercial Add-Ons will require registration). I hope that MapForge will earn a place in your mapping toolbox, and I’m optimistic that you’ll find it so useful that you will want to get a license eventually, in order to unlock the software’s full potential.</p>
<p><strong>Quicker Map Creation</strong></p>
<p>With MapForge, I want to help GMs <i>reduce</i> their session prep time, not increase it. You shouldn’t have to spend several hours or even days creating a decent map for your game session. Using keyword searches and tags, you’ll find that elusive content you’re searching for in no time. My goal with MapForge is to enable you to whip up a great map in under an hour. Sometimes even two maps.</p>
<p><strong>And the most important element of all...FUN!</strong></p>
<p>Other map-making programs on the market can be a real chore to use. It just feels too much like work. MapForge intends to make map-making FUN! Because if you aren’t having <i>fun</i> exercising your god-like GM powers of creation, you’re doing it wrong.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1511966590/haqf8koso5wbsdmlwt1k.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The initial inspiration for this project came from using commercial mapping tiles for tabletop RPGs. I found that the tiles themselves looked fantastic, but that the actual act of putting together a map layout, particularly for large layouts, was painstaking and rather tedious, even though I happen to be well-versed with a professional image editing program (Photoshop).</p>
<p>GMs who want to print out map tiles that they purchase online or create themselves aren't the only ones affected by this ""technical barrier to entry"". Many people nowadays use virtual tabletop (VTT) software to play RPGs remotely, but VTTs are far from optimal map-making tools. They can be wonderful for having a few objects on the map that the players can interact with, but crafting entire map layouts from dozens or even hundreds of map elements is hardly their forte, and the time and effort required to do so would be inordinate.</p>
<p>So I decided to create an easy-to-use computer program that would be the best possible tool I could dream up for the task of stitching together pre-made map tiles and and then populating them with decorative elements (e.g., furniture, treasure, debris, etc.) to suit a GM's particular needs. I'm calling the program <strong>MapForge</strong>. It is intended to allow anyone, regardless of their art skills (or lack thereof), to create gorgeous, high-resolution battlemaps.</p>

<p><strong>Who Is MapForge For?</strong></p>
<p>MapForge is for any GM who wants to create a drool-worthy tactical-scale battlemap for any genre of RPG. It's also suitable for tabletop miniature games and wargames.</p>
<p><strong>What MapForge Isn't</strong></p>
<p>If you've tried other mapping software and been frustrated with the learning curve and/or the results, that may be because the software tried to be too many things, and ended up not excelling at any one thing.</p>
<p>• MapForge is <i>not</i> a general-purpose mapping app; you probably won't be using it to map out continents or entire worlds. It’s narrower in scope, focusing primarily on tile-based and grid-based mapping at tactical combat scale (typically 1” = 5 ft., or 1 hex = 3 feet).</p>
<p>• MapForge is <i>not</i> a general-purpose paint program, nor a CAD program. It’s more of a layout and design tool, intended for anyone to use, not just the artistically or technically gifted.</p>
<p>• MapForge is also <i>not</i> just a simple “texture-stamping” program. Some of the features are geared towards producing Photoshop-like effects without the steep learning curve that producing such effects normally requires. The software will (eventually) allow you to create maps by drawing rooms and corridors with straightforward drawing tools (with optional snap-to-grid functionality) and then applying ""styles"" to the walls and floors, including special effects like bevels, glows, strokes, blurs, and drop shadows, and (optionally) textures (e.g. stone, brick, cement, cobblestones, etc.). Some ""general purpose"" styles will come included (pre-configured) with the app, while other styles you will create or tweak yourself to achieve a very specific look.</p>

<p>To ensure that great content would be available for use in the program, I formed an alliance with some of my favorite content creators in the field of mapmaking for RPGs. All of them are A-list artists who are well known and respected in the map-making community. They, too, saw the need for such a program, and decided to add their support. Collectively, their published work comprises a vast library of top-notch content that should cover the indoor and outdoor battlemap needs of most RPGs.</p>

<p>In addition to the Perk rewards, during this campaign you may pledge for the following additional items. Simply increase the amount of your pledge by the cost of the Add-On/s you desire. A post-campaign survey will be sent to collect additional information and clarify exactly what items you pledged for.</p>
<p>The bulk of the proceeds from Add-On sales will go to the artists. But if we can collectively show them that the added convenience of the MapForge Add-On format will earn them more sales, it will validate one of the program's principal reasons for existing.</p>
<p><i><strong>IMPORTANT! All content Add-Ons are strictly for ""Personal Use Only"" EXCEPT those that are clearly marked as approved for publishing or commercial use (there are 6 such Add-Ons listed on this page, and another 3 free Add-Ons).

<p><i>Be sure to watch the ""MapForge Add-On Preview"" video (see the Gallery), as it may help you figure out which Add-Ons you want. The name of the currently-displayed Add-On is shown in the upper right corner of the screen.</i></p>
<p><strong>Offerings from Battlegrounds Games:</strong></p>
<p><i><strong>Use MapForge on a 2nd computer:</strong></i></p>
<p>Add $5 to your pledge if you would like to use MapForge on a 2nd computer <i>that you own</i>. This is only for backers who are getting a MapForge license and/or paid content Add-Ons. This one-time setup fee is a flat rate, and covers all Add-Ons you get now or in the future. It is being offered so that no one has to buy a 2nd license for themselves or purchase a 2nd copy of their Add-Ons. You may NOT use this allowance to permit someone else the use of your paid Add-Ons.</p>
<p><i><strong>Gifting a MapForge license to a friend:</strong></i></p>
<p>Add $30 to your pledge (at any pledge level) to get an additional MapForge license for a friend. When the email survey goes out at the end if this campaign, be sure to include your friend's email address so that I can get them their license code. You can even order more than one license to gift, if you desire. Note that any content Add-Ons that you get for yourself will not also be applied to your friend's license.</p>
<p>For your convenience, there is a custom <strong>Pledge Calculator app</strong> that you can download: See <a href=""https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/mapforge-battlemap-creation-software-for-rpgs-rpg/x/17813835#/updates/1"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">this Update</a>.</p>
<p>As MapForge's userbase grows, additional Add-Ons will be developed and released in the future, both from the above content providers and from others that will want to service the MapForge community. The above selection of Add-Ons is just the ""first wave"", and should be more than enough for the time-being. A ""second wave"" of content development is expected to begin in February 2018, and it will stress non-fantasy genres much more.</p>
<p>If by chance you have already purchased some of the above content in the original PDF or PNG format, you should be able to use it in MapForge, albeit without some of the added convenience provided by the Add-On format. Some of the content providers might be willing to allow free registration of the respective Add-Ons to customers who've already purchased their content in its original format and can show proof of purchase.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>MapForge will offer a free level of use, so it will be usable even by those who have not purchased a license (albeit with a reduced output resolution and a few other limitations). This should allow the MapForge userbase to grow very rapidly, which in turn will make the platform more appealing to content publishers, who may want to make their wares available in MapForge.</p>
<p>In addition to using content from pre-packaged Add-Ons, MapForge will also allow you to use your own artwork (either created by you, or downloaded from elsewhere, such as the <a href=""http://www.dundjinni.com/forums/default.asp"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">Dundjinni user forums</a> or <a href=""http://rpgmapshare.com/modules/g2/main.php"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">rpgmapshare.com</a>) via drag-and-drop.</p>

<p>I don't expect too many people to back this project on faith alone. Many of you have likely been disappointed by prior map-making software, so a healthy degree of skepticism is expected. That is why I am making the MapForge Beta release publicly available. Download the software and try it out for yourself, in order to evaluate it. Take the program for a spin to see if this is going to be what you want/expect it to be.</p>
<p>Click <a href=""http://www.mapforge-software.com/MapForge_Beta_Release_3_Win.zip"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> to download MapForge Beta Release 3 for Windows (Zip, 26.6 MB)</p>
<p>Click <a href=""http://www.mapforge-software.com/MapForge_Beta_Release_3_Mac.zip"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> to download MapForge Beta Release 3 for Mac OS X (Zip, 38.3 MB)</p>
<p>Note that the software does not come with mapping assets included, so be sure to download the content below.</p>
<p>Click <a href=""http://www.mapforge-software.com/Free_Add-Ons_for_MapForge.zip"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">here</a> to download 10 free content Add-Ons for MapForge (Zip, 1.54 GB)</p>
<p>Some users have reported errors when all the Add-Ons are loaded/active at once. Simply disabling the Halls of Nys Add-On (the biggest Add-On of the 10, and thus the most memory-intensive) should help prevent out-of-memory errors.</p>
<h3><strong>Technical Tips:</strong></h3>
<p><i><strong>All users: </strong>If you see a message asking that you please install ShockWave, don’t. Shockwave is <strong>not</strong> required. Most likely, you have not heeded one or more of the instructions provided below. MapForge is entirely self-contained, meaning you don’t need to install any additional software or frameworks. If you see a message to that effect, ignore it; the problem lies elsewhere (contact me for troubleshooting assistance once you’ve tried all the suggestions below).</i></p>
<p><i><strong>Mac OS Sierra (or High Sierra) users:</strong> This Beta Release is not code-signed, and therefore Mac OS’s Gatekeeper feature will not allow the program to launch unless you first follow the “special measures” mentioned <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/battlegrounds/mapforge-battlemap-creation-software-for-tabletop/posts/1824745"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">here</a>. If you launch MapForge and it immediately starts asking you for files it can’t locate, it’s a sign that you have not properly followed those one-time instructions.</i></p>
<p><i><strong>Windows users:</strong> It's recommended that you unzip the downloaded file using the built-in Windows unzipping utility, rather than a third-party tool, and to not attempt to launch MapForge from within the uncompressed Zip file. Don't install MapForge in your Programs directory. If you want to launch MapForge from your desktop, don't simply move the executable there. It needs to reside in the same folder it comes in so that it can access the Support Files, Xtras, etc. Instead, drag an <strong>Alias</strong> of the MapForge app to your desktop. Users with Windows 10 64-bit OS are advised to run MapForge as an administrator and in 32-bit compatibility mode. Norton Security Suite might false inform you that ""MACAddress.xtra"" is a harmful file. Ignore that warning, it's a false-positive.</i></p>
<p>I advise everyone to read the included ""MapForge Hotkeys"" document, since by doing so you'll discover lots of stuff you can do that you wouldn't otherwise know about.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Any maps produced using this Beta Release that incorporate other artist's artwork should not be used commercially or published.</p>
<h3>Features</h3>
<p>• Quickly assemble existing map tiles into a large map layout. The maximum canvas size of 12,000 x 12,000 pixels allows for a 60x60 inch map at 200 dpi resolution (that's 5 square feet, which is probably bigger than your gaming table!).</p>
<p>• Support for layers (to adjust the stacking order of items on a map) and for grouping together assets (for greater organization).</p>
<p>• Randomization features for textures (to avoid repeating patterns) and for placed items (e.g. randomly scatter trees, automatically varying their size and rotation).</p>
<p>• Media Types: Tiles, Tile Overlays, Items, Drawn Shapes (e.g. walls and floors, with optional textures)</p>
<p>• Adjust the location, scale, rotation, and opacity of any placed Item.</p>
<p>• Toggle between Day &amp; Night versions with the click of a button (with Add-Ons that support this feature).</p>
<p>• Ability to mark Items that should only appear on the GM version of a map (e.g. room key numbers, traps, secret doors, etc.).</p>
<p>• Easily apply bitmap filters, for special effects such as Bevel, Glow, Drop Shadow, Stroke, Color Adjustment, Brightness/Contrast, etc. to individual assets, or to entire layers at once.</p>
<p>• Convenience of the MapForge Add-On format: The software will know how large each tile should be (in grid squares), where the exits are, what tiles can be placed next to it and connect properly, and will make it easy to find content via tags and keyword searches (note that much of this functionality is planned for after v1.0).</p>
<p>• Export the entire map, or just the part you want.</p>
<p>• Compile an Inventory of the Tiles used to create a map layout. Useful for GMs who want to plan out their layouts of Dwarven Forge (or similar) 3D tiles.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>The risk factor on this project is minimal, as the software is about 90-95% finished. The only rewards that could be considered ""risky"" is the two Stretch Goals described above, though I don't foresee any technical problems after having completed the research &amp; planning phases.</p>
<p>All rewards for this project are digital downloads, so shipping is neither a factor nor an added expense. Battlegrounds Games has over a decade of experience distributing software and content packs.</p>
<p>If there should be a delay in delivery, it will most likely be related to completion of a handful of content Add-Ons. Forty of the fifty planned Add-Ons have already been completed, so only 10 Add-Ons have yet to be created. The program will be released along with all the Add-Ons have been completed to date, so that backers can start using the software right away, and any remaining Add-Ons can be delivered piecemeal as they are completed.</p>
</div></div>","Introducing new battlemap creation software for tabletop RPGs
Have you always wanted to make your own slick-looking full-color battlemaps, but just don’t have the time or patience to learn to use a sophisticated image editing application like Photoshop or Gimp? Or perhaps you tried anyway but found it too difficult and/or time-consuming?
Have you tried existing mapping software and been frustrated with the learning curve, the cost, the interface, and/or been disappointed by the results?
If the answer to any or all of those questions is “yes”, then my brand new MapForge application is probably just what you’ve been searching for.
What makes MapForge special?
Easy to use
MapForge will be very easy to use. A GM should be able to start making maps on Day 1 after watching a brief tutorial video, without even bothering to read the User Manual. By extension, they should never feel like they need to re-learn the software, even if it’s been many months since they last used it.
Support for Add-Ons (both free and commercial)
Make your maps using top-notch professional Add-On content, or using your own content, or a mix of both.
Low-cost/Inexpensive
I’m making the software itself very affordable, so that you’ll have plenty of money left over to purchase a good selection of content Add-Ons.
Versatile
Although it’s primarily intended for creating battlemaps (in any genre), the program will provide enough flexibility that, given the right content, you’ll also be able to create other types of maps, ranging from area maps to deep space. You can use the software to make high-resolution maps for printing, or lower-resolution maps for use in your favorite virtual tabletop software.
Gorgeous and user-friendly interface
The user interface for MapForge is thematically generic, but very attractive and modern. And it should appeal to you whether you’re the type who prefers to click on buttons and choose menu commands to get things done, or of you’re the power-user type who likes to use hotkeys to get things done that much quicker.
Cross-platform
Whether you’re a Windows user or a Mac user, MapForge has you covered. And if you have a MapForge license and someday decide to switch platforms, you can just request a new license code for the new operating system, free of charge.
High-quality results
The output is crisp, detailed, and (optionally) high-resolution. Many of the image filter effects produce results that are indistinguishable from high-end image editing software such as Photoshop.
Empowering, but with a shallow learning curve
MapForge will help you unleash your creativity. It’s not intended just for the artistically or technically gifted. It will allow anyone, regardless of their art skills or technical skills (or lack thereof), to create gorgeous, detailed battlemaps. With MapForge, you’ll be able to produce Photoshop-like effects such as bevels, drop-shadows, strokes, glows, blurs, and color adjustments without the steep learning curve that producing such effects normally requires.
Offers a free level of use
You’ll be able to use MapForge to make nice maps even if you haven’t purchased a license. Even use free and commercial Add-Ons without a license (though commercial Add-Ons will require registration). I hope that MapForge will earn a place in your mapping toolbox, and I’m optimistic that you’ll find it so useful that you will want to get a license eventually, in order to unlock the software’s full potential.
Quicker Map Creation
With MapForge, I want to help GMs reduce their session prep time, not increase it. You shouldn’t have to spend several hours or even days creating a decent map for your game session. Using keyword searches and tags, you’ll find that elusive content you’re searching for in no time. My goal with MapForge is to enable you to whip up a great map in under an hour. Sometimes even two maps.
And the most important element of all...FUN!
Other map-making programs on the market can be a real chore to use. It just feels too much like work. MapForge intends to make map-making FUN! Because if you aren’t having fun exercising your god-like GM powers of creation, you’re doing it wrong.
 

The initial inspiration for this project came from using commercial mapping tiles for tabletop RPGs. I found that the tiles themselves looked fantastic, but that the actual act of putting together a map layout, particularly for large layouts, was painstaking and rather tedious, even though I happen to be well-versed with a professional image editing program (Photoshop).
GMs who want to print out map tiles that they purchase online or create themselves aren't the only ones affected by this ""technical barrier to entry"". Many people nowadays use virtual tabletop (VTT) software to play RPGs remotely, but VTTs are far from optimal map-making tools. They can be wonderful for having a few objects on the map that the players can interact with, but crafting entire map layouts from dozens or even hundreds of map elements is hardly their forte, and the time and effort required to do so would be inordinate.
So I decided to create an easy-to-use computer program that would be the best possible tool I could dream up for the task of stitching together pre-made map tiles and and then populating them with decorative elements (e.g., furniture, treasure, debris, etc.) to suit a GM's particular needs. I'm calling the program MapForge. It is intended to allow anyone, regardless of their art skills (or lack thereof), to create gorgeous, high-resolution battlemaps.

Who Is MapForge For?
MapForge is for any GM who wants to create a drool-worthy tactical-scale battlemap for any genre of RPG. It's also suitable for tabletop miniature games and wargames.
What MapForge Isn't
If you've tried other mapping software and been frustrated with the learning curve and/or the results, that may be because the software tried to be too many things, and ended up not excelling at any one thing.
• MapForge is not a general-purpose mapping app; you probably won't be using it to map out continents or entire worlds. It’s narrower in scope, focusing primarily on tile-based and grid-based mapping at tactical combat scale (typically 1” = 5 ft., or 1 hex = 3 feet).
• MapForge is not a general-purpose paint program, nor a CAD program. It’s more of a layout and design tool, intended for anyone to use, not just the artistically or technically gifted.
• MapForge is also not just a simple “texture-stamping” program. Some of the features are geared towards producing Photoshop-like effects without the steep learning curve that producing such effects normally requires. The software will (eventually) allow you to create maps by drawing rooms and corridors with straightforward drawing tools (with optional snap-to-grid functionality) and then applying ""styles"" to the walls and floors, including special effects like bevels, glows, strokes, blurs, and drop shadows, and (optionally) textures (e.g. stone, brick, cement, cobblestones, etc.). Some ""general purpose"" styles will come included (pre-configured) with the app, while other styles you will create or tweak yourself to achieve a very specific look.
 

To ensure that great content would be available for use in the program, I formed an alliance with some of my favorite content creators in the field of mapmaking for RPGs. All of them are A-list artists who are well known and respected in the map-making community. They, too, saw the need for such a program, and decided to add their support. Collectively, their published work comprises a vast library of top-notch content that should cover the indoor and outdoor battlemap needs of most RPGs.

In addition to the Perk rewards, during this campaign you may pledge for the following additional items. Simply increase the amount of your pledge by the cost of the Add-On/s you desire. A post-campaign survey will be sent to collect additional information and clarify exactly what items you pledged for.
The bulk of the proceeds from Add-On sales will go to the artists. But if we can collectively show them that the added convenience of the MapForge Add-On format will earn them more sales, it will validate one of the program's principal reasons for existing.
IMPORTANT! All content Add-Ons are strictly for ""Personal Use Only"" EXCEPT those that are clearly marked as approved for publishing or commercial use (there are 6 such Add-Ons listed on this page, and another 3 free Add-Ons). Pledging at the ""Publisher/Commercial"" pledge level does NOT give you the right to use other Add-Ons in commercial or published projects.

Offerings from Battlegrounds Games:
Use MapForge on a 2nd computer:
Add $5 to your pledge if you would like to use MapForge on a 2nd computer that you own. This is only for backers who are getting a MapForge license and/or paid content Add-Ons. This one-time setup fee is a flat rate, and covers all Add-Ons you get now or in the future. It is being offered so that no one has to buy a 2nd license for themselves or purchase a 2nd copy of their Add-Ons. You may NOT use this allowance to permit someone else the use of your paid Add-Ons.
Gifting a MapForge license to a friend:
Add $30 to your pledge (at any pledge level) to get an additional MapForge license for a friend. When the email survey goes out at the end if this campaign, be sure to include your friend's email address so that I can get them their license code. You can even order more than one license to gift, if you desire. Note that any content Add-Ons that you get for yourself will not also be applied to your friend's license.
For your convenience, there is a custom Pledge Calculator app that you can download: See this Update.
As MapForge's userbase grows, additional Add-Ons will be developed and released in the future, both from the above content providers and from others that will want to service the MapForge community. The above selection of Add-Ons is just the ""first wave"", and should be more than enough for the time-being. A ""second wave"" of content development is expected to begin in February 2018, and it will stress non-fantasy genres much more.
If by chance you have already purchased some of the above content in the original PDF or PNG format, you should be able to use it in MapForge, albeit without some of the added convenience provided by the Add-On format. Some of the content providers might be willing to allow free registration of the respective Add-Ons to customers who've already purchased their content in its original format and can show proof of purchase.
 
MapForge will offer a free level of use, so it will be usable even by those who have not purchased a license (albeit with a reduced output resolution and a few other limitations). This should allow the MapForge userbase to grow very rapidly, which in turn will make the platform more appealing to content publishers, who may want to make their wares available in MapForge.
In addition to using content from pre-packaged Add-Ons, MapForge will also allow you to use your own artwork (either created by you, or downloaded from elsewhere, such as the Dundjinni user forums or rpgmapshare.com) via drag-and-drop.
 

I don't expect too many people to back this project on faith alone. Many of you have likely been disappointed by prior map-making software, so a healthy degree of skepticism is expected. That is why I am making the MapForge Beta release publicly available. Download the software and try it out for yourself, in order to evaluate it. Take the program for a spin to see if this is going to be what you want/expect it to be.
Click here to download MapForge Beta Release 3 for Windows (Zip, 26.6 MB)

Note that the software does not come with mapping assets included, so be sure to download the content below.
Click here to download 10 free content Add-Ons for MapForge (Zip, 1.54 GB)
Some users have reported errors when all the Add-Ons are loaded/active at once. Simply disabling the Halls of Nys Add-On (the biggest Add-On of the 10, and thus the most memory-intensive) should help prevent out-of-memory errors.
Technical Tips:
All users: If you see a message asking that you please install ShockWave, don’t. Shockwave is not required. Most likely, you have not heeded one or more of the instructions provided below. MapForge is entirely self-contained, meaning you don’t need to install any additional software or frameworks. If you see a message to that effect, ignore it; the problem lies elsewhere (contact me for troubleshooting assistance once you’ve tried all the suggestions below).
Mac OS Sierra (or High Sierra) users: This Beta Release is not code-signed, and therefore Mac OS’s Gatekeeper feature will not allow the program to launch unless you first follow the “special measures” mentioned here. If you launch MapForge and it immediately starts asking you for files it can’t locate, it’s a sign that you have not properly followed those one-time instructions.
Windows users: It's recommended that you unzip the downloaded file using the built-in Windows unzipping utility, rather than a third-party tool, and to not attempt to launch MapForge from within the uncompressed Zip file. Don't install MapForge in your Programs directory. If you want to launch MapForge from your desktop, don't simply move the executable there. It needs to reside in the same folder it comes in so that it can access the Support Files, Xtras, etc. Instead, drag an Alias of the MapForge app to your desktop. Users with Windows 10 64-bit OS are advised to run MapForge as an administrator and in 32-bit compatibility mode. Norton Security Suite might false inform you that ""MACAddress.xtra"" is a harmful file. Ignore that warning, it's a false-positive.
I advise everyone to read the included ""MapForge Hotkeys"" document, since by doing so you'll discover lots of stuff you can do that you wouldn't otherwise know about.
Disclaimer: Any maps produced using this Beta Release that incorporate other artist's artwork should not be used commercially or published.
Features
• Quickly assemble existing map tiles into a large map layout. The maximum canvas size of 12,000 x 12,000 pixels allows for a 60x60 inch map at 200 dpi resolution (that's 5 square feet, which is probably bigger than your gaming table!).
• Support for layers (to adjust the stacking order of items on a map) and for grouping together assets (for greater organization).
• Randomization features for textures (to avoid repeating patterns) and for placed items (e.g. randomly scatter trees, automatically varying their size and rotation).
• Media Types: Tiles, Tile Overlays, Items, Drawn Shapes (e.g. walls and floors, with optional textures)
• Adjust the location, scale, rotation, and opacity of any placed Item.
• Toggle between Day & Night versions with the click of a button (with Add-Ons that support this feature).
• Ability to mark Items that should only appear on the GM version of a map (e.g. room key numbers, traps, secret doors, etc.).
• Easily apply bitmap filters, for special effects such as Bevel, Glow, Drop Shadow, Stroke, Color Adjustment, Brightness/Contrast, etc. to individual assets, or to entire layers at once.
• Convenience of the MapForge Add-On format: The software will know how large each tile should be (in grid squares), where the exits are, what tiles can be placed next to it and connect properly, and will make it easy to find content via tags and keyword searches (note that much of this functionality is planned for after v1.0).
• Export the entire map, or just the part you want.
• Compile an Inventory of the Tiles used to create a map layout. Useful for GMs who want to plan out their layouts of Dwarven Forge (or similar) 3D tiles.
 

The ""Artist Sampler Bundle"" contains the following Add-Ons:

GS 3 and Bandit Camp, from Lord Zsezse Works

Dark Crypts, from Black Scrolls Games

King's Road Country Highway, from Heroic Maps

Dungeon Blanks MapForge Special Edition, from DungeonArts

Fantasy Furniture Tokens, from Studio Wyldfurr

Slap-Down Town: Village, from Gabriel Pickard

Mines, from Steve Gaudreau

Instant Dungeon Dressing, from Bogie

Kepli's Tree Pack, from Kepli (duh!)

 
The ""Commercial/Publisher Bundle"" contains the following Add-Ons (which are all approved for use in published/commercial projects):

Fantasy, from Steve Gaudreau

Sci-Fi, from Steve Gaudreau

Mines, from Steve Gaudreau

Cemetery & Ceremony, from Steve Gaudreau

Instant Dungeon Dressing, from Bogie

Kepli's Tree Pack, from Kepli (duh!)

 
The ""Mapping Basics"" Add-On is based on Corey Macourek's work (you know, the professional cartographer who works on Paizo's GameMastery line of battlemats?), and will be included with every Perk in this campaign that includes a MapForge license. It will later be sold separately for $6. This Add-On allows for use in published or commercial products.
 

I have an established track record developing virtual tabletop software for over a decade, with over a hundred releases to date. As a software developer, I have a reputation for being accessible, communicative, open to feedback and criticism, and prolific. I've always provided timely technical support to all users of my software. In short, I deliver, I'm in this for the long haul, I have an established reputation to uphold, and I'm passionate about my products.
 

MapForge v1.0 is just weeks away from release. The Beta version just made its debut when this campaign launched. It is being made available to everyone (not just backers), to maximize user feedback.
Anyone is welcome to track the development progress of MapForge and its Add-Ons at any time by visiting the MapForge Trello board. It is updated regularly.
 

The bulk of the money raised by this crowdfunding campaign will pay for the development time that I have estimated it will take to complete the MapForge software and the Add-Ons that will be released for it.
Any significant overfunding will hopefully also enable me to fulfill two Stretch Goals from the original Kickstarter campaign that the initial funds proved to be insufficient for:
1. The Donjon Support Stretch Goal, explained in this video.
2. To develop the free Crucible utility app that will allow users to create their own Add-Ons for MapForge. There are plans in place (and permission has been secured) for porting an existing massive library of content called the CSUAC to MapForge's Add-On format.
 

I need your support to help me complete the development of MapForge. Help me create the most useful mapping program to visually enrich your RPG game sessions while reducing your prep time. GMs already have plenty of work they need to do to prepare for each game session. Making maps should not eat up most of that time.
Whether or not you choose to make a pledge to this campaign, I would greatly appreciate it if you could mention this project to friends or family members who might be interested. I've made it easy to do so; just click on one of the buttons below. Help spread the word far and wide.


Last but not least, I'd love it if you would follow Battlegrounds Games on any or all of these social media sites, so you can stay apprised of all the latest news and developments. And consider signing up to the MapForge mailing list.

Since then they have become very popular with the community and a common sight in leagues and tournaments around the world.</p><p>The rules for our favourite fantasy football game are, however, changing and due to come into force at the end of 2020. This fundamental change means that the original Casualty Dice are now only applicable to the older rule sets. The new rule set now means we need a new 16-sided &amp; 6-sided dice to continue enjoy killing and maiming each other on the field of play! </p><p>I will end by simply saying that using a set of dice for one specific purpose is great fun. I love to roll dice and actively look forward to getting to use them against my opponent, and I'm sure you will too!

Don’t worry, you can pre-order the Casualty Dice on my store page now! Just follow the link here to my store and make your order. Once production is complete I will then ship out your order. Estimated shipping date is January 2021.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Welcome to the Casualty Dice: 2020 campaign page. Read below to find out more about this new Fantasy Football crowdfunding campaign.My original Casualty Dice campaign launched in 2017 funded in under 24hrs and went on to raise 946% of the original goal. Since then they have become very popular with the community and a common sight in leagues and tournaments around the world.The rules for our favourite fantasy football game are, however, changing and due to come into force at the end of 2020. This fundamental change means that the original Casualty Dice are now only applicable to the older rule sets. The new rule set now means we need a new 16-sided & 6-sided dice to continue enjoy killing and maiming each other on the field of play! I will end by simply saying that using a set of dice for one specific purpose is great fun. I love to roll dice and actively look forward to getting to use them against my opponent, and I'm sure you will too! I have poured all of my creativity, energy, and love for fantasy football, into these dice and I hope you can be part of the journey to bring them to the community for all to enjoy for years to come. Producing dice can be very expensive; particularly when every side of the dice has a custom design. More sides = more cost.The plan is to produce a new set of dice: a beautiful Translucent D16 in blood red with white infill colour icons, and a 16mm D6 in bright white with blood red colour infill. The D16 will be a custom-made dice, and the icons will be part of the dice mould. This means no laser engraving is required; just crystal-clear designs with solid colour fill.I've always felt that dice should communicate to you and your opponent the result with immediacy and clarity. Good, simple and clean design does just that and that's what I will be producing for this project. The dice icons are designed specifically with a medical theme in mind, exclusively using the red and white colours.The D6 icons are work in progress. The new (unreleased) rules now show a minus and plus to the stats of the injured player. There is a small grey area that needs to be clarified before I release the new updated icons, so watch this space for news on this.I will be producing 100 Limited Edition Black D6's which will arrive in addition to the base D6 + D16 combo you see above. Only 100 of these will be produced and come at no extra cost over the base set, so well worth backing quickly to take advantage of this offer.  Fancy being Immortalised for all eternity? Then this is the perk for you! You'll receive the base D16 & D6 set, plus a Limited Edition Black D6; already amazing! Check this though, you'll also have your likeness conceptualised and illustrated into an apothecary character of your very own, This card will match perfectly and sit with the existing cards you find in this campaign.You'll have input into your characters look, traits, race and so on. This is a fantastic way to pick up all the available goodies of the campaign and also have an awesome and memorable card to your pledge; a very personal way to contribute to this community driven campaign. But that's not all! In addition to all of the above you'll also receive a high resolution digital file for your very own personal use AND this Perk has FREE SHIPPING! As with my previous casualty dice project, the dice came with fantastic playing cards which represented your team’s Apothecary or the Traveling Apothecaries. I can confirm these will come with every set of dice ordered as standard. I will also be producing a brand new reference card to help us all get used to the new way of hurting each others team members!Shortly before the launch of this campaign, I sent out a four question survey to all the backers/customers of Charlie Victor Products. That survey revealed concerns that the rules might change and render the new casualty dice useless. I subsequently want to confirm that I will not produce the dice from this campaign until the rules for 2020 are confirmed. This may delay the delivery of the pledges, but it will 100% mean that you receive dice that will be compatible with the updated rules. I hope this goes some way to reassure you that you will receive a fantastic and relevant product, that you can enjoy for years to come.Add-on perks can be purchased at the checkout when you complete your order. They do not require any additional shipping costs (apart from Human Team Tokens) and are highly discounted; a perfect time to make savings and pickup items you may have missed out on previously.Every game of fantasy football starts with a kick-off. The referee flips the coin after a coach has picked a side. Heads or Tentacles? There are even myths about coaches rolling dice to see who kicks and receives.Well, no more! I’m very proud of this coin, confident that it is at least the equal of any fantasy football community produced coin in existence. A quality item for a momentous choice - kick or receive?Produced in antique silver plating.Being the coach of a fantasy football team is a difficult and frequently violently curtailed career choice. Some are better than others at dealing with the stresses of coaching a team, prowling the sidelines, barking orders and questioning the calls and parentage of the referee. Sometimes they go a little too far…Assuming all is well, this coach coin shows your head coach where they belong; in the dugout. Should they go too far and have to be removed from the game just for politely suggesting at knifepoint that the ref lets their poor little chainsaw back on the pitch then simply turn this coin over to show your coach has left the dugout.With any luck, they'll recover from their 'security escort' in time for the next match…Produced in antique silver plating and coloured enamel.A High-Quality Embroidered Patch for the 'FAS' - the Foul Appreciation Society! This patch is produced to a high standard and comes with an iron-on material on the reverse. I plan to slap mine onto my favourite shirt and show the world just how “foul” I am!The dice that started it all! Now referred to as Legacy Casualty Dice and can be used with all rules prior to the 2020 release. Two dice, one 6-sided engraved 16mm opaque white die and the other an 8-sided engraved red die. The dice design shows clearly what the result is. No fumbling about getting the two numbers mixed up etc. The dice show you the result instantly. Should you require more information detailing the seriousness of the injury, you will be able to reference the handy, high quality reference card included with each set of dice.I love ogres! But sometimes they just will not go and thump that opposition player, damnit! To show that your teams ogre is not responding to your clear instructions, I’ve developed this soft silicone ring so it can be placed over the ogre to show its current state of mind – Bonehead.It’s been designed with the miniature in mind; a soft, durable ring that will not damage your paint job (assuming you have one!). Let’s just hope you don’t have to use it that much.Bribery! Such a wonderful thing. If you have deep enough pockets you can really gain an advantage with these. Foul to your heart's content safe in the knowledge that you can just pay off the referee should they have the temerity to try to enforce the rules.Be careful though as referees can be greedy, and you may need more than one to convince them to look the other way. So spend these valuable coins wisely.You can track your spending by turning each one over after use. The bloody tears on the reverse side of each coin will be a dead giveaway as to its status.Try not to roll too many ones…Produced in antique gold plating and coloured enamel.Nobody, and I mean NOBODY, bribes as hard as goblins do. They are masters at it. Which is just as well as they're terrible at everything else! They work hard to subvert the rules, so much so that the little buggers stole the original bribe coin die stamps and produced their own versions, with some very dubious amendments! They have even tried to dodge showing if they have used them at all - very sneaky stuff - the gits!Never fear though, because the bloody tears reverse side always gives away the status of the bribe.Produced in antique bronze plating and coloured enamel.To help you understand what is included in this pack a glance, here is a quick summary.Team Icon TokenKicked TokenReceived TokenScore Tokenx3 Unique Re-Roll TokensOgre Bonehead BandOgre Stunned/Prone TokenFAME TokenTeam Apothecary TokenBall Carrier Token32mm Coach Miniature (in Resin or Metal)Wizard TokenKegs Token (with built in bottle opener)Human Team PatchTeam Dice (x2 D6)Team Block Dice (x3 D6)Dice CupDice MatDice & Token BagCharlie Victor Backer PatchThat’s a total of 22 incredibly unique items coming your way.

Produced to the usual premium standards you’ve come to expect from Charlie Victor. Keyrings are just the start, in the future I plan to produce more diverse merchandise. For more details on this range checkout the store page.Keyring inspired by the 1986 classic ‘Aliens’ by James Cameron, this keyring details the UA 571-C Sentry Guns HUD used to defend the Colonial Marines position within Hadley's Hope on LV-426. C & D guns were the last defence against the Aliens, covering a corridor intersection. Originally cut from the theatrical release of the movie but included in the Special Edition, it makes for one hell of a scene.This double-sided keyring reflects both guns in those scenes, and includes the accurate details of the rounds remaining, barrel temperatures and seconds of fire left on each weapon. Produced in Black Zinc Alloy with punchy enamel colour fill at 60mm x 30mm in size and weighing in at 61 grams.The Indiegogo platform now enables you to buy add on perks (4) when you purchase your chosen main perk (1).

We design and manufacture enduring objects that spark a sense of wonder. To preorder the Tetra Puzzle and bring it to life, click Back This Project. Or scroll on for more details. What makes the Tetra Puzzle special? It's a captivating and mysterious challenge to understand and unlock. It activates your spatial reasoning and manual dexterity skills in a way that's immersive and deeply engaging — some people call this a flow state, we call it Puzzle Time™. On first glance the Tetra Puzzle might seem fairly straightforward; in reality it's anything but intuitive. Solving it requires focus, attention, and an exploratory mindset that's innately gratifying. It pushes your boundaries — if only a little bit — and invites you to learn something new.The Tetra Puzzle is a joy to keep coming back to. The weight of the object is satisfying, and the simultaneous movement of all four pieces remains enchanting even after you've mastered it. Stuck on a call? You'll reach for the Tetra.Beyond its allure as a meditative object, it's incredible to watch friends discover the magic for themselves. Whether or not you provide hints is up to you.The Tetra Puzzle is a little sculpture. When it's not in your hands, it's a beautiful object to display on a desk, shelf, or coffee table. The pyramidal form evokes ancient architectural wonders, and the trisected faces of each side feel at once familiar and otherworldly. What is it? How does it work? What is it made from? Why does it exist? Composed of four identical pieces of stainless steel, the Tetra Puzzle’s components fit together to form a four-sided pyramid (or tetrahedron) with sculpted edges and contours.It's surprisingly hefty for its small frame, weighing 1.5 lbs and measuring 2.9"" W x 2.7"" L x 2.5"" H.The Tetra Puzzle is available in two different finishes: Stainless Steel or Vapor Black. The Stainless is classic, reflective, and showcases the metal in its natural state. 'The Vapor Black is a coating that is applied to the stainless steel called physical vapor deposition (or PVD). It's super-durable, matte in texture, and a sleek and beautiful alternative for those drawn to the dark side.After you've fully gotten the hang of it, you can progress to spinning it atop your finger. (No just kidding, this is an animated GIF created in post-production. Please don't try this at home.)The Tetra Puzzle is the culmination of five years of designing and developing mechanical puzzles. We're confident it's our most engaging, shareable puzzle yet, and we're very excited for you to experience it firsthand.Design and Manufacturing ProcessThe story of the Tetra Puzzle starts with our friends Nate and Damein at Revision. In January of 2020 they sent us a 3D printed prototype of a new puzzle they had been working on, and we were immediately blown away.We have been designing and manufacturing these types of puzzles for years now, but this one was unlike anything we had ever experienced.

We immediately asked if they would consider working with us to release it as a Craighill product, and they agreed.Similar to our Venn Puzzle, the Tetra is a simultaneous movement puzzle—all four pieces have to open and close at the same time in order for it to budge at all.

<p>The MapForge map-making software continues to evolve. What initially began as a tool for making quick and easy top-down tactical-scale maps for tabletop RPGs has gradually grown to also support hex-tile-based area/regional mapping, edit Donjon-generated maps to customize them to your exact needs (or create your own custom dungeons from scratch), and more recently (thanks to <a href=""https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/battlegrounds/isometric-map-making"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">a Kickstarter campaign</a>) to allow the creation of isometric maps.</p>

<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>All rewards for this project are digital downloads, so shipping is neither a factor nor an added expense. Battlegrounds Games has over a decade of experience distributing software and content packs.</p>
<p>All of the third-party content being ported to MapForge's Add-On format already exists, so there won't be any delay in getting that content from each provider.</p>
<p>Now that I've already produced well over 100 MapForge content Add-Ons, I have a very solid grasp of how long porting content to MapForge format takes, and I continually strive to further streamline the process, for faster turnaround.</p>
<p>In short, this is an extremely low risk campaign, and one with a quick delivery date. Please be sure to try out the free version of the software prior to pledging.</p>
</div></div>","The MapForge map-making software continues to evolve. What initially began as a tool for making quick and easy top-down tactical-scale maps for tabletop RPGs has gradually grown to also support hex-tile-based area/regional mapping, edit Donjon-generated maps to customize them to your exact needs (or create your own custom dungeons from scratch), and more recently (thanks to a Kickstarter campaign) to allow the creation of isometric maps.
Now I'd like to offer mapping content tailored specifically for the oft-ignored Post-Apocalyptic genre, because GMs of post-apocalyptic tabletop RPG games need maps, too! Unfortunately, quality Post-Apocalyptic mapping content is very hard to find.
You should be interested in this campaign if you're a Game Master (or plan to be) for any of the following RPGs:

Deadlands: Hell on Earth
Darwin's World
Exodus
Morrow Project
RIFTS
Aftermath!
Twilight: 2000
Broken Earth
GURPS After the End (Wastelanders)
or other Fallout-like RPGs

Pick your game and Dized takes you through it step by step. You get just the information you need to start playing right away. You learn all you need to know about the game– but at a better pace. No info dump, no rules you can’t use yet.
 

 
That means you can go to your friendly local game store, buy a new title, and start playing immediately.


 

Forgot something or need to look something up? Enter the Rule Lookup Tool. We digitize and cross-reference rule books into small, manageable chunks. We’re also working on a powerful search tool which can answer your questions with a few taps. The content will always be up to date and publisher approved.


Our first batch of titles includes something classic, something aimed at families, and a couple of titles for the more demanding hobby gamers. We have plans for hundreds of games, but filling our library in a reasonable time frame is a resource-heavy process: that’s why we need your help to make it happen!

</h3><p>This game is a culmination of the love that I have for card games, role playing games, true crime and horror. My interest in killers, of all kinds, started at a young age. I grew up just outside Philadelphia and my dad had so many stories to tell. His dealings with Angelo Bruno (head of the Philly Mob), meeting Charles Manson, to leading us to believe that my childhood home was owned by Jeffrey Dahmer's uncle. There has always been one question that I have always wanted to understand: What is the one thing that causes someone to cross the line and become a killer? Many of us fit the common classification, but never cross the line...why? So as I have dug in and really researched these horrific stories I found the passion to create this game.</p><p>It is not only a card game, but a compendium of killers that you may/may not know.

</ul></div>","This game is a culmination of the love that I have for card games, role playing games, true crime and horror. My interest in killers, of all kinds, started at a young age. I grew up just outside Philadelphia and my dad had so many stories to tell. His dealings with Angelo Bruno (head of the Philly Mob), meeting Charles Manson, to leading us to believe that my childhood home was owned by Jeffrey Dahmer's uncle. There has always been one question that I have always wanted to understand: What is the one thing that causes someone to cross the line and become a killer? Many of us fit the common classification, but never cross the line...why? So as I have dug in and really researched these horrific stories I found the passion to create this game.It is not only a card game, but a compendium of killers that you may/may not know. This has always driven my own curiosity to learn and discover more. As we continue to create expansions and grow the list of killers included it becomes a collectible trading card game.                                  Killers - the card game is a collectible card game currently featuring 25 unique killer cards, 25 victim cards, and 4 unique scenario cards for the base game. The Organized Crime Expansion adds an additional 70 killers, 20 weapons, and 10 scenario cards.The base game is for 2-5 players, but will increase with expansions.To win the game be the player that reaches 10 kills first or has the last killer standing.We are looking to hit our funding goal of $3000 to fulfill the quality manufacturing and production of new cards. This will also enable us the ability to have some stock so we can start sharing the fun at some of the local horror expos that we will be attending.In addition to the perks that we are already offering we will have some amazing stretch goals:

Inspired by my online art classes, I designed it as a fun way to bring friends and family together through the ageless art of cartooning.Who's it for?This is a game for kids and BIG Kids (that's you adults!) who like to doodle and get creative. You can play on your own, or together with friends and family.I wanted to give more people the chance to experience my fun approach to being creative!  Whether you're a young artist, a keen doodler or perhaps haven't drawn in a long time... the game is designed to spark and inspire your imagination! You don't have to be an artist!This is about using your imagination and making simple drawings to create some serious cartoon laughs.I've taken the best Topics from my weekly Cartoon Club classes, plus the funniest Ideas for characters, captions and crazy objects and put them together in the game for you.  The game rules are even illustrated to make it easy for people who are visual learners like me.  
1. The goal
Your aim is to draw the most fun and creative scene on a single sheet of paper. A picture filled with characters, captions and crazy objects telling a story based on a Topic.
 2. Get Set UpIt's easy to set up: grab a sheet of paper and a pen or pencil for each player. You'll also need a timer (like on your phone). Use any other pens, markers or colours you like.3. Choose Game TypeDecide on the type of game you'll play. You can play a quick, standard or long game. The more rounds you play, the more challenging the game! Feel free to change the time per round if all players agree.4. Select a Topic cardSelect a Topic card and read it out loud for the table. Each player will draw their scene based on this Topic for the entire game. These are the best topics from my online class with images to inspire and questions to get your creative juices flowing! 5. Pick an Idea cardTurn over one Idea card for the table. You can use this as inspiration for drawing on your Topic. Interpret the Idea card as freely as you like. Expand on it as much as you like. You’ll turn over a new Idea card with each drawing round to spark your imagination.6. Choose your Creative ChallengeBefore drawing the round, each player must choose to do one of the following:a) Use the Idea cardb) Steal an idea (you’ve seen someone else draw after round one)c) Get creative (and use your imagination!)7. Time to DrawStart the timer and begin drawing. Draw as much as you like in the time allowed. 8. Vote for your FavouriteStop and look at everyone’s picture. Each player casts one vote for the picture they think is the most fun and creative for that round. You'll claim Creative Challenge points every time someone votes for your picture.9. Add to your pictureGrab a new Idea card for the table and repeat the same steps with every round. Keep adding more characters, captions and crazy objects to your picture until you’ve completed all drawing rounds. Don't forget your Topic! The more you draw the funnier your picture becomes!10. The Winner!By the end you'll have a picture filled with characters, captions and crazy objects telling your very own story on the Topic. The most creative picture wins as voted by you and your fellow Cartoon Clubbers!More Ways to use the Game...The game's super fun to play even if you don't keep score. There are lots of ways to use it whether as a game or drawing activity - you'll spark limitless new creations!✔️ Family games night or Party game✔️ Play online with friends✔️ Get inspired to doodle on your own                               ✔️  Homeschooling creative activity                             ✔️ Challenge yourself with a daily doodle      ✔️ Start your own Cartoon Club! I promise you're going to be surprised at just how creative you can be!Don't think you can draw? ....Try my Introduction to Cartooning Online Course! It's the perfect way to discover your inner cartoonist. If you want to not only improve your drawing skills but also create your own cool characters and draw fantastic cartoon scenes, this is the course for you! The course will be available in July 2021 - in time for summer - so if you want to spend some time getting creative over the holidays, now's your chance!
 

 
 Who's the online course for?The course is aimed at both beginners, who have not done a lot of cartooning before, as well as keen doodlers who want to develop their own style. The course is based on my Cartoon Club for Kids class (ages 8-12) and Discover Your Inner Cartoonist (adult) class. So no matter your age, if you enjoy putting pen to paper, you're going to be surprised at just how creative you can be! What will you learn?✔️ The fun way to be drawing simple cartoons in no time ✔️ How to capture great expressions on faces                                 ✔️ Show action and motion in your characters                                 ✔️ Use lettering, bubbles and shapes to draw words                                 ✔️  Design your own cool characters                                 ✔️  Create a fun, fulled cartoon scene                                 ✔️  Make your characters pop with colour Course Content How's it different?This cartooning course is more than just a step-by-step instruction on how to draw cartoons. I’ll explain how I approach each drawing, how I play with ideas to design interesting characters, and the types of questions I ask myself when my drawing isn't quite working out how I want. My goal is to give you the skills to be creative with your drawing and build confidence to solve challenges when you’re working on your own. Wondering if the course is right for you? Try the FREE Course Taster! If you want to see what the course is like, grab your pencil and try the Course Taster. It's one full cartooning exercise from the section on Capturing Expression.  It's about 20 minutes long and all you need is a pencil and paper. I promise it’s fun - I think you’ll be surprised at what you'll produce! What are people saying about Cartoon Club?What do you learn by cartooning? How can you help children get off screens? What's it like learning to draw as an adult? How can kids build a creative mindset? How can you nurture young artists? Check out what other parents and students are saying about Cartoon Club:   The following is a list of the shipping prices. Note for our USA backers we can only ship to the contiguous USA (we cannot ship to Alaska, Puerto Rico, Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands and the U.S. Virgin Islands).  Unfortunately we cannot ship to P.O. boxes as the packages are too large and there is too great a risk of them being bounced back.The chart below reflects the cost to send 1, 2 or 3 copies of a Cartoon Club Original Game.  Note if you buy additional add-on items then your shipping cost will rise according to the number of copies you buy. We’re happy to be working with our partners in Canada who will be manufacturing our game. Me and the Team want to do a great job delivering you, our backers, a fantastic quality product! Plus by manufacturing in North America we’ll significantly decrease our lead-time and your game won’t have to travel half way around the world to reach you. That means great quality, less risk, friendly for the environment and more doodling time for you!The conservative estimated delivery date for the Game is December 2021 but we think that date will be moved up to be sooner (we'll keep you posted if you'll get your games sooner!).  The Online Course will be available in July 2021.  Due to logistics some backers may receive their games before others depending on their location. Terms & ConditionsBy pledging to this project you acknowledge that the final look, materials and content of the rewards are subject to change and may differ from what is presented in the project.

If you do not log into confirm your pledge in the system within 3 weeks of our notification by email to confirm your pledge, you agree that we have fulfilled our obligations to you in full for the payment or donations received. If you confirm your pledge after the deadline has elapsed then it will be at our discretion as to whether or not we refund or ship your pledge.

After that date we will not be able to process refunds. Any ""no reward"" pledges will not be refunded. We are always happy to refund pledges if for some totally unforeseen reason the game or course can't be delivered at all.

We’d always liked to play card games and talked before about creating one together. During the period when the European borders were open for a while, we went on a hiking trip in Switzerland. One evening, with our feet up and a beer in hand, we decided to ‘walk the talk’ and come up with our own card game. We had thought about it for a while and many ideas and game mechanisms did pass the table that night. At the end of the brainstorm we felt we were onto something.

Although it was our first game to create, we were committed and went to work in our evening hours. It was a challenging process which required a lot of imagination but the interesting part was that hidden talents surfaced. Koen turned out to be quite skilled at drawing so he was promoted to chief design officer. After two months, we were quite satisfied with the game mechanism and initial designs. We created an initial prototype and we started to play with dozens of friends to test our game. Looking back, this is the best thing we could have done as they gave us a lot of new input to digest. At this point, we were still very much focused on the game mechanism rather than the design itself. And as you can see below… quite lame, right? Still, the play testers seemed to like it so it gave us confidence to sail ahead and focus on the design itself!</p><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1626111067/bwlpcetsulqpphvywixp.png"" src=""""/></p><p>During these months, our designer Koen started to draw and digitalise the first designs.

The largest part of our time was focused on creating the unique designs and to make sure the rules were written as simple and clearly as possible (which turned out to be quite a challenge…).

It was a challenging process which required a lot of imagination but the interesting part was that hidden talents surfaced. Koen turned out to be quite skilled at drawing so he was promoted to chief design officer. After two months, we were quite satisfied with the game mechanism and initial designs. We created an initial prototype and we started to play with dozens of friends to test our game. Looking back, this is the best thing we could have done as they gave us a lot of new input to digest. At this point, we were still very much focused on the game mechanism rather than the design itself. And as you can see below… quite lame, right? Still, the play testers seemed to like it so it gave us confidence to sail ahead and focus on the design itself!During these months, our designer Koen started to draw and digitalise the first designs. And the rise of King Fridge, First of His Name, The Cool King of Food, Sir of the Spoiled and the Fresh... Allright, let's stick with King Fridge.  February 2020 - A few months passed playing the game over and over again with different prototypes. The largest part of our time was focused on creating the unique designs and to make sure the rules were written as simple and clearly as possible (which turned out to be quite a challenge…). Each iteration we took the opportunity to test the game with a different group of play-testers and so the cycle repeated. Slowly but steadily, the game came to life…June 2021 - Who could have imagined!? Almost 6 six years after our first hike together, we have a card game in our own hands and ready to share with you. We have poured a lot of time and energy into this project and we are super excited to now finally share this game with you. With your support, we can realise this dream and give you an early copy of our first ever card game called King Fridge. We are committed to bring you many more card games in the future as we fell in love with the game creation process. Thank you for reading, your support and considering to add us to your game collection!Greetings from the Kingdom of the Netherlands - Koen, Niels, Sjoerd & DennisAll cards in the Kingdom of King Fridge, stretch goal additions still excluded",25.0,0,"1 Campaign

It contains numerous gory descriptions and situations that go beyond the ordinary style of swords &amp; sorcery fiction and are more what one would expect in horror fiction. There is a dark element in most sword &amp; sorcery fiction, which we embrace as a part of that literary genre, but <i>The Fiend of Turlin’s Well</i> unquestionably crosses over from the swords &amp; sorcery approach of “dark-by-implication” into the horror genre of “look-into-the-dark.” Many of our fans have asked for adventures like this one, but by the same token we don’t want to surprise or ambush fans who expect a pure swords &amp; sorcery genre adventure. If you’re interested so far, then by all means, please read on …</p><p><strong>The Basics</strong></p><p>The Fiend of Turlin’s Well seems like an ordinary city adventure at the beginning, set in the Turlin’s Well District of the City of Bard’s Gate, but gets darker and stranger as events move on. An unknown troublemaker is progressing from vandalism to kidnapping to murder, and the district’s civil order starts to come unraveled as the city watch remains helpless to stop the very visible crimes. The adventure is for introductory-level characters (level 1-2), but the players should be experienced; the courses of action aren't obvious enough for beginning players.</p><p><strong>Spoiler Alert: For the GM Only</strong></p><p>Torad Yarog, the Fiend, is not only a doppelganger with multiple personalities, he is also the captain of an inter-dimensional ship and a favored cultist of the Demon-Princess Teratashia, Mistress of the Gaps between realities. Hunting him down leads the characters to an old manor house in the city filled with gruesome evidence of the Fiend’s crimes, and clues that allow them to pursue the truth onward to the Death-Ship of the Roach Princess (soon to be released via Indiegogo).</p><h3> </h3><p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613594586/y2lf6ntktzgun5moqxbr.png"" src=""""/></p><p><strong>About Pathfinder</strong></p><p>We are not publishing a full Pathfinder version of The Fiend of Turlin's Well. However, we have given permission for Michael Russell's patreon to prepare a set of conversion notes for the adventure after the Indiegogo. If you plan on running the adventure for Pathfinder using these notes, you will need a copy of the adventure itself (in either version) to refer to.</p><p><strong>Death-Ship of the Roach Princess</strong></p><p>The Fiend of Turlin's Well has a companion adventure by Matt Finch that can be used as either the prequel or sequel. There are two interrelated things happening, and the order in which the characters encounter them isn't vital.

It contains numerous gory descriptions and situations that go beyond the ordinary style of swords & sorcery fiction and are more what one would expect in horror fiction. There is a dark element in most sword & sorcery fiction, which we embrace as a part of that literary genre, but The Fiend of Turlin’s Well unquestionably crosses over from the swords & sorcery approach of “dark-by-implication” into the horror genre of “look-into-the-dark.” Many of our fans have asked for adventures like this one, but by the same token we don’t want to surprise or ambush fans who expect a pure swords & sorcery genre adventure. If you’re interested so far, then by all means, please read on …The BasicsThe Fiend of Turlin’s Well seems like an ordinary city adventure at the beginning, set in the Turlin’s Well District of the City of Bard’s Gate, but gets darker and stranger as events move on. An unknown troublemaker is progressing from vandalism to kidnapping to murder, and the district’s civil order starts to come unraveled as the city watch remains helpless to stop the very visible crimes. The adventure is for introductory-level characters (level 1-2), but the players should be experienced; the courses of action aren't obvious enough for beginning players.Spoiler Alert: For the GM OnlyTorad Yarog, the Fiend, is not only a doppelganger with multiple personalities, he is also the captain of an inter-dimensional ship and a favored cultist of the Demon-Princess Teratashia, Mistress of the Gaps between realities. Hunting him down leads the characters to an old manor house in the city filled with gruesome evidence of the Fiend’s crimes, and clues that allow them to pursue the truth onward to the Death-Ship of the Roach Princess (soon to be released via Indiegogo). About PathfinderWe are not publishing a full Pathfinder version of The Fiend of Turlin's Well. However, we have given permission for Michael Russell's patreon to prepare a set of conversion notes for the adventure after the Indiegogo. If you plan on running the adventure for Pathfinder using these notes, you will need a copy of the adventure itself (in either version) to refer to.Death-Ship of the Roach PrincessThe Fiend of Turlin's Well has a companion adventure by Matt Finch that can be used as either the prequel or sequel. There are two interrelated things happening, and the order in which the characters encounter them isn't vital. If you would like to sign up to receive a notification when we launch the Indiegogo for Death-Ship of the Roach Princess, click here.The Project Frog God Games projects on Indiegogo are simple, focused, and short.
Short in duration (2-3 weeks)
Fast delivery of PDF once funding is completed
Limited to a single title
Have options priced between $5-$30
Stretch goals and project bonuses (if any) affect the principle reward only (usually both the PDF and the softcover).
Are the only guaranteed method to get the premium* print copy (NOTE: the softcover versions  in this printing will not be sold on our website: see FAQ for explanation).
Have a simple fulfillment process that does not use Backerkit
*Premium means heavyweight glossy interior pages enhancing the art and color elements. The  thick, glossy cardstock brings out the vibrant color of the cover illustration. These are the nicest softcover books we have ever sold and we only print a title this way once.Any reprint would use print on demand service that, although nice, do not approach the quality of our INDIEGOGO funded books.Why the Tiny Print Run?Since 2012 our crowdfunding approach has been extravagant in every way. Ambitious with massive page counts, plus numerous add-on options and stretch goals. All supporting a primary title itself as many as 990 pages.This has resulted in Kickstarter's with memorable pledge rewards that include top-quality hardcover books with sometimes dozens of stretch goal bonuses and add-on extras. These are awesome AND they are expensive to buy for customers like you because they are very expensive to make for publishers like us.Why not use Kickstarter?We will still be using Kickstarter, frequently, for our large-scale projects, but we hear the request for less expensive options for our products all the time, especially smaller, faster-paced adventures that can be completed in 2-3 sessions.Product enhancements tied to project success During the funding period for The Fiend of Turlin's Well and after the funding goal is met we will  improve the delivered product based on additional sales. There are no special tiered collectors editions or add-on purchase extras. Thus, as total project funding increases, the better the final product will be for everybody.Examples of improvements made to earlier products:
Additional commissions for interior color art specific to the adventure. 
The previous Indiegogo project added 2 interior art pieces and 3 extra creature illustrations for its appendix.
Downloadable Options designed for popular virtual table-top software (The rewards for both How Orcus Stole Christmas! and In Vino Gigantus included the new creature/NPC tokens and player maps). 
High-resolution files of illustrations to share with players at the table.
