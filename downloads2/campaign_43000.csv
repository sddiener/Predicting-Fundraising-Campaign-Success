<p>Working out, walking, running or cycling can be uncomfortable and hazardous to your phone when you want to keep it on you.  </p>
<p>The large smartphones of today are not suitable for armbands due to discomfort, bulky or stiff construction and weights of over half a pound. Pockets can be loose or poorly positioned causing your phone and personal items to fall out or bounce around.  </p>
<p>With our vast experience in designing cutting edge athletic apparel and workout gear, it made absolute sense to design the perfect wearable. A secure, ergonomic and stylish solution whether you're in the gym, on the field or the streets!  </p>
<p>One of our most praised features on our best selling tights was our smartphone pocket. We felt this sophisticated solution needed to be independently upgraded.  </p>
<p>It had to be adaptable to the moving body at all levels of intensity. Comfortable yet durable materials that would mold to your form in motion. </p>

<p>The Kik clip is going to change your life... kinda.</p>
<p>The Kik Clip is the coolest shoe accessory you ever need to own. How many of us are guilty of shoving our feet into our shoes? How often have we seen our kids struggle putting on their shoes? The critics say that kids and adults should untie and tie their shoes. Really? When is the last time that happened? At the end of the day, sometimes it's just the little things we do that make our life easier and that is exactly what the Kik Clip is all about. I am a father of three and I want to say I have some experience as a parent and this product is for me as much as it is for my kids.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576096378/wgdzkx9aqa6okasgjppo.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now I asked myself would it be nice if all my kids have their shoes untied ready to put on and then fully tie them back on? Of course! Unfortunately this isn't my reality</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576096461/tybjyogksyxhjnkgiwqj.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>and I know it isn't for a lot of other people. Through this whole process of designing the Kik Clip I realized what a useful product it could be for everyone. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1576096535/pvjyosz0fxjwl8neeemc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Seniors will love how easy it is to use the Kik clip. No more balancing and fidgeting to get the foot in, with the Kik Clip slips right in. I have also received feedback from Physical therapists who have said this would make many of their patients life much easier. The bottom line: This products works, and more importantly, you and everyone who uses it will benefit. My hope and wish is to get this to market and share this with the world.</p>
<p>I need your support to make this a reality. Thank you for taking the time to read my campaign! Hopefully we can bring this product to reality! Just FYI the two colors we are providing will be Red and Yellow.</p>
<p><strong>Risks and challenges</strong></p>
<p>The budget is the biggest obstacle. I need to be able to cover the mold cost which is the biggest cost of the project. The challenge of bringing in a new product is proving to the consumer that this is something they can use and benefit from.</p>

At the end of the day, sometimes it's just the little things we do that make our life easier and that is exactly what the Kik Clip is all about. I am a father of three and I want to say I have some experience as a parent and this product is for me as much as it is for my kids.
 

 
Now I asked myself would it be nice if all my kids have their shoes untied ready to put on and then fully tie them back on? Of course! Unfortunately this isn't my reality
 

 
and I know it isn't for a lot of other people. Through this whole process of designing the Kik Clip I realized what a useful product it could be for everyone. 
 

 
Seniors will love how easy it is to use the Kik clip. No more balancing and fidgeting to get the foot in, with the Kik Clip slips right in. I have also received feedback from Physical therapists who have said this would make many of their patients life much easier. The bottom line: This products works, and more importantly, you and everyone who uses it will benefit. My hope and wish is to get this to market and share this with the world.
I need your support to make this a reality. Thank you for taking the time to read my campaign! Hopefully we can bring this product to reality! Just FYI the two colors we are providing will be Red and Yellow.
Risks and challenges
The budget is the biggest obstacle. I need to be able to cover the mold cost which is the biggest cost of the project. The challenge of bringing in a new product is proving to the consumer that this is something they can use and benefit from.",3.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3> </h3>
<h3><strong>The products</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The London bag</strong></p>
<p>This is the first bag we designed and it's your go to travel bag. It is created to fit most airlines cabin measurements being 55cm x 35cm x 20cm. We wanted to make it as large as possible within the cabin restrictions, so you can bring everything you need on your trip.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567710882/qkoadsorkfapknxj3nes.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The bag is padded to protect your items and has a strong YKK zipper.</p>
<p>In the front, we have kept it super simple and just added the Lemon Suite logo in a tone-in-tone color.</p>
<p>On the back, you will find a pocket where you can easily store magazines and items you want to be able to reach quickly. We have also added a sleek strap to place the bag on your suitcase.</p>
<p>Inside there is a padded space for your laptop. On the other side, we have placed a fanny pack for your important items. It serves as a pocket inside the bag and is easily removed and doubles as an extra bag. You can take it out if you want to have your important belongings on you during the flight or use the fanny pack on your trip.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567710943/szpc0lovhqgjme1n4pxl.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>You can get the London bag in green or black.</p>

</div><div>
<p>The Berlin bag is perfect for those who prefer to travel with a trolley. Most airlines allow a small bag to accompany your trolley - this is what we aimed for. It is also a perfect size bag to use on trips and in everyday life. Besides all your important items like wallet, keys and phone, it also holds a water bottle and a light sweater or scarf.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567711022/peygaxipujgdy3yx83bf.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>It has the Lemon Suite logo on the front and the back features a pocket held together with magnets. This is great for items you want to have within quick reach, like your phone or keys. </p>

<p>Inside the bag, you will find a pocket with a zipper for your smaller items. The bag is padded to protect your items and to keep its shape even if you havn’t filled it up.</p>

<p>You can get the Berlin bag in black or green.</p>
<p>Measurements: Length 26cm, height 19cm, width 8cm. The adjustable shoulder strap can be 68-113cm.</p>
<p><strong>The Paris bag</strong></p>
<p>The Paris bag is an even more simplified version of the London bag. We have created this for those of you, who want the bag to take up as little space as possible.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567711219/s95kbc3aesdmdqq1alwc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Completely basic, it has the Lemon Suite logo on the front, is securely closed with a sturdy zipper and features one zippered pocket on the inside. It is unlike the large travel bag not padded, but it is created in the same durable material.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567711258/ubxff6z8p3i95nrf2uys.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>The Paris bag is available in black and green.</p>
<p>Measurements: Length 55cm, height 35cm. The shoulder straps are 65cm. </p>
<p><strong>The Copenhagen tote</strong></p>
<p>The Copenhagen tote is the perfect companion on trips - and in life. It takes up no space and when you have been shopping or want to take off your jacket, you can pack it into the tote and have your hands free. We have created this in a super cool see-through fabric, which is durable and soft.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567711338/eucmzkk0pddsmnoc4n3g.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We chose to create the tote in white because of the different effect in the material. You can also go with the black version, as seen here. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567711354/nnpainqd0aajmqgllwqr.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Copenhagen tote is larger than the average tote bag, measuring: Length 48cm, height 49 cm and the shoulder straps are 55cm.</p>
<p><strong>The Amsterdam pouches</strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1567711442/kv5n8t1yq2a8plallqxx.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p>The Amsterdam pouches come in a set of 3 different sizes. They are brilliant to pack loose items or toiletries into. They can be used alone and with any of the bags. We especially love to use it with the see-through small tote, because it hides the items you don’t want people to see - and you get to show off the pouch. The pouches are only available in black with white logo. </p>

<p><strong>The Tokyo packing cubes</strong></p>
<p>The Tokyo packing cubes come in a set of 3 different sizes. They are great for the organized packer and make everything easy to find in the large travel bag, the large tote and in any suitcase. We have added the logo and a see-though net, so you don’t have to open it to locate which items is in which organizer. The packing cubes only come in black.</p>

<h3> </h3>
<h3>Shipping &amp; customs information</h3>
<p>We do not have control over international shipping charges. International shipping rates may vary depending on your delivery location and the product you select due to the difference in size and weight. This fee will be calculated based on the shipping country you’ve selected.</p>
<p>If our shipping carrier attempts delivery to you and the package returns to our warehouse (either because you’re not there, the wrong address was provided, or you moved without telling us), it will be the buyer's responsibility to pay the shipping fee to reship the order. When you receive your tracking number, please keep an eye out for the package.</p>
<p>Backers may have to pay additional import duties or other applicable taxes to the concerned authorities upon receipt of their goods - depending on the import policies of their respective countries. The duties and tax rates vary from country to country. If you wish to learn about the duties and taxes applicable to your shipment, you may want to check with the customs and border protection authority of your country.</p>
<p>All products are being shipped from Denmark.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Risks &amp; challenges</h3>
<p>Although many crowdfunding projects have come up with their best, there are always variables. Depending on how many backers support our product, the situation for manufacturing and transportation may vary. We have prepared a number of plans for that situation, and we will choose to ensure that our products arrive in a stable manner as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If we don’t reach our goal of sales for a product, we may have to find a different factory, which might slightly change the denier in the fabric or the colors. We have a very strong attention to detail and quality and we will make sure that the end product lives up to expectations before shipping it out. We will of course keep all our backers updated in every step we take.</p>

Measurements: Length 55cm, height 35cm, width 20cm. The shoulder straps are 67cm.
The Berlin bag 


The Berlin bag is perfect for those who prefer to travel with a trolley. Most airlines allow a small bag to accompany your trolley - this is what we aimed for. It is also a perfect size bag to use on trips and in everyday life. Besides all your important items like wallet, keys and phone, it also holds a water bottle and a light sweater or scarf.

The soft shoulder strap is adjustable so you can wear it exactly as you prefer.  

It has the Lemon Suite logo on the front and the back features a pocket held together with magnets. This is great for items you want to have within quick reach, like your phone or keys. 

Inside the bag, you will find a pocket with a zipper for your smaller items. The bag is padded to protect your items and to keep its shape even if you havn’t filled it up.

You can get the Berlin bag in black or green.
Measurements: Length 26cm, height 19cm, width 8cm. The adjustable shoulder strap can be 68-113cm.
The Paris bag
The Paris bag is an even more simplified version of the London bag. We have created this for those of you, who want the bag to take up as little space as possible.

Completely basic, it has the Lemon Suite logo on the front, is securely closed with a sturdy zipper and features one zippered pocket on the inside. It is unlike the large travel bag not padded, but it is created in the same durable material.


The Paris bag is available in black and green.
Measurements: Length 55cm, height 35cm. The shoulder straps are 65cm. 
The Copenhagen tote
The Copenhagen tote is the perfect companion on trips - and in life. It takes up no space and when you have been shopping or want to take off your jacket, you can pack it into the tote and have your hands free. We have created this in a super cool see-through fabric, which is durable and soft.

We chose to create the tote in white because of the different effect in the material. You can also go with the black version, as seen here. 

The Copenhagen tote is larger than the average tote bag, measuring: Length 48cm, height 49 cm and the shoulder straps are 55cm.
The Amsterdam pouches

The Amsterdam pouches come in a set of 3 different sizes. They are brilliant to pack loose items or toiletries into. They can be used alone and with any of the bags. We especially love to use it with the see-through small tote, because it hides the items you don’t want people to see - and you get to show off the pouch. The pouches are only available in black with white logo. 

The pouch features a large Lemon Suite logo going around both sides of the pouch.


Measurements: Small: 21cm x 15cm. Medium: 26cm x 20cm. Large: 35cm x 27cm.
The Tokyo packing cubes
The Tokyo packing cubes come in a set of 3 different sizes. They are great for the organized packer and make everything easy to find in the large travel bag, the large tote and in any suitcase. We have added the logo and a see-though net, so you don’t have to open it to locate which items is in which organizer. The packing cubes only come in black.




Measurements: Small: 24cm x 17cm x 10cm. Medium: 32cm x 27cm x 10cm. Large: 39cm x 32cm x 10cm.
 
Time line
February 2019: Prototyping development

October 2019: End of Indiegogo campaign
October 2019: Gather information from backers about color choices and shipping information 
November 2019: Production begins

Future goals
In Lemon Suite, our dream is to expand the collection of simple and stylish products, that make life easier on the go. We are looking to create the bags in the colors of the season and to expand with a well-designed backpack  - of course without compromising neither style nor practicality. 
 
Shipping & customs information
We do not have control over international shipping charges. International shipping rates may vary depending on your delivery location and the product you select due to the difference in size and weight. This fee will be calculated based on the shipping country you’ve selected.
If our shipping carrier attempts delivery to you and the package returns to our warehouse (either because you’re not there, the wrong address was provided, or you moved without telling us), it will be the buyer's responsibility to pay the shipping fee to reship the order. When you receive your tracking number, please keep an eye out for the package.
Backers may have to pay additional import duties or other applicable taxes to the concerned authorities upon receipt of their goods - depending on the import policies of their respective countries. The duties and tax rates vary from country to country. If you wish to learn about the duties and taxes applicable to your shipment, you may want to check with the customs and border protection authority of your country.
All products are being shipped from Denmark.
 
Risks & challenges
Although many crowdfunding projects have come up with their best, there are always variables. Depending on how many backers support our product, the situation for manufacturing and transportation may vary. We have prepared a number of plans for that situation, and we will choose to ensure that our products arrive in a stable manner as soon as possible.
If we don’t reach our goal of sales for a product, we may have to find a different factory, which might slightly change the denier in the fabric or the colors. We have a very strong attention to detail and quality and we will make sure that the end product lives up to expectations before shipping it out. We will of course keep all our backers updated in every step we take.",21.0,0,"1 Campaign

A minimum of £16000 will be required to locate and rent suitable workshop premises in Mombasa, the workshop will be equipped with benches, lockers, air conditioners, extractor fans, toilet and washing facilities, extra facilities will be installed as and when required. Creche accommodation will be provided near, or ideally, adjacent to the workshop. The creche will be a priority adjunct to the business and will be equipped and staffed accordingly.
All staff, both production and careers will be paid a good living wage (Ks360 per hour) enabling  them to rent good quality and secure accommodation, A one bedroom apartment costs Ks13/15 per month, A two bedroom apartment costs Ks15/20 per month, A three bedroom apartment costs Ks20/25 per month. Power, water and connectivity will be afforded by wages. A major concern for all parents is the education of their children, this will be one of my priorities also. Education, books, uniforms and school outings will be afforded by employees wages. The creche facilities, lunch and tea breaks for staff and children will be provided free.
I will arrange health insurance for each employee. A pension plan will be set up for each employee. Tax is factored in @ Ks2000 per week. These three items sum approximately Ks4000 and will deducted from the employees wages. I will install a bonus scheme based on productivity. The working day will be from 7.30am to 12 noon, 1pm to 5.30pm. with two 15 min. tea breaks. Five days per week with an option of working Saturday morning 8am to 1pm. The basic working week will be 45 hours, this x Ks360 = Ks16,200 per week. Regardless of any elevated costs re. tax etc. I will guarantee a minimum wage of  Ks12, 200 per week. This figure will provide a standard of living commensurate with  a Western middle class standard.
I intend to create a content, prosperous workforce as an exemplar.",0.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>Hello, I am Jacky Wong, the CEO and founder of <strong>HEDONE</strong>. When I look back at my childhood, by far my favorite memories are of me spending each summer holiday, alongside my father, in his watch factory. It was the foundation of my future career in horology and the catalyst for my fascination for creating unique timepieces. With my father’s encouragement, after leaving education I joined the watch industry and have been immersed in it for over 15 years.</p>
<p>During this time, I observed that the affordable watch sector became very stale, and you could say way too conventional. Many existing brands release very similar designs, and there's far too much repetition of design content and features. End users often buy into a brand, or follow a designer label, and the actual aesthetics and function of the timepieces often becomes the secondary concern. The Logo on the watch, or the brands name in identifiable lettering can blind the purchaser to inferior quality products and mass produced movements. I want to correct that, and bring back affordable, beautiful watches that are truly a joy to own.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1578230576/pxcd0vnme74tzm1qetmy.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Watches should be works of art, both aesthetically and mechanically. The balance of these two factors and then the emotion they offer the wearer are the key factors that I truly want to bring to the market. I have therefore set a goal for myself and my team of horologists. We will offer an affordable, truly desirable, high quality, and inspirational timepiece to the market. It will instill in the wearer a sense of pride in wearing the product, and to balance this, it will reassure them of the mechanical accuracy, reliability and workmanship involved in its conception.</p>
<p>All HEDONE watches will be assembled, finished and quality assured by our own master watch makers. Every aspect of the production, from the initial concept and design stages right through to the final packaging and shipping to clients will be overseen by myself. I truly love my work, and I am very proud of the products we produce and the team I have assembled to create them.</p>

<h3><strong>COSMIC DUALITY - OUR INSPIRATION:</strong></h3>
<p>We have one philosophy that has inspired and governs everything we do at HEDONE. Yin and Yang are the basic factors of parity that govern natural law. It is the motive force of all life cycles that breed, develop, mature, decline and die. It Isn't just a philosophy though, it inhabits everything from Mathematics to Science, the Arts and Medicine. Yin and Yang do not exist on their own, both parties co-exist, because of the existence of the other. Yin and Yang shows us how seemingly opposite or even contrary forces may actually be complementary to each other and interconnected, The Yin-Yang philosophy says that the universe is composed of forces of dark and light, sun and moon, male and female.</p>
<p>Its concept and teachings are at least 3,500 years old, and it has been recorded they were discussed in the ninth-century BC text known as the 'I Ching' (or 'Book of Changes') and to this day influences the philosophies of Taoism and Confucianism. The iconic Yin-Yang symbol is related to the ancient method used to track the movements of the sun, moon, and stars. Yin is usually characterized as a feminine inward energy. It's still, dark, and negative. Yang is characterized as outward energy, masculine, hot, bright, and positive. Their co-existence and balance are what guide is in everything we do at HEDONE.</p>
<p>With Yin and Yang as our inspiration, we have created our PHILOSOPHE watch range, in initially just two designs, with both incorporating elements of Yin and Yang.</p>

<p>HTD was born as a small independent company in the watch-industry after Federico Del Guerra and Federico Zulian, two Italian designers met during their studies.</p>
<p>The common passion for watch-making brings them soon to deal with the recurrent idea of doing something in this branch, and to bring new turmoil in the watchmaking industry in Italy.</p>

HTD Horological Tools Department
We are based in Florence. The Heart of Italian Watchmaking, 
Take something to drink and a comfortable seat, we introduce ourselves and explain the history and the motivations driving the creation of Horological Tools. 
HTD was born as a small independent company in the watch-industry after Federico Del Guerra and Federico Zulian, two Italian designers met during their studies.
The common passion for watch-making brings them soon to deal with the recurrent idea of doing something in this branch, and to bring new turmoil in the watchmaking industry in Italy.

The parts are designed, assembled and serviced in the territory of Florence, thanks to experts and to the best hands that the workshops of the local artisans have to offer. This means that the quality remains at first place.

 

 
Hesagraph is the first official collection for HTD. This fills us up with pride, especially seeing how much hard work it has cost us and our partners


The inspiration is clearly that of motor racing from the '50s, '60s and '70s: dirty, rough, and reckless, but that have been able to give to the world the courage of precise and refined heroes.
Exactly as our watches, which cut the curve of time clean as razors.

<h3>ABOUT FIRLE </h3>
<p><strong>“A powerful heritage design honouring traditional watchmaking. Painstakingly sculpted using the finest materials.” </strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590139180/boirq2gnkedl8g3vsz2t.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Firle Watches takes its name from the Old English word fierol, meaning oak-covered land - a name that carries strength and integrity and a name that embodies our British heritage and landscape. The coastline that surrounds us here can often be fierce and powerful. These are the days we most look forward to – they force us to escape, and they bring with them possibility.</p>
<p>The fine movements in our watches are every bit as rugged, powerful and beautiful as the ocean and landscape from which we draw our inspiration. Firle watches are for admirers of mechanical perfection, lovers of adventure - and lovers of life.</p>
<p>In much the same way, we believe our timepieces will come to embody the story of those who wear them. They are designed to be with you for the whole journey.  </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>OUR PROMISE </h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590139225/uzm6agussghlvxti4taq.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>At Firle, we are passionate about the Ocean, it's the source of our inspiration and it's a place that provides us with a huge amount of joy. We believe it is the responsibility of both consumers and companies to minimise our impact on the environment. Which is we have decided to donate £5 from the sale of every Firle timepiece to the charity Plastic Oceans. Plastic Oceans is a leading ocean clean-up initiative that aims to reduce the amount of plastic pollution in our oceans through science, sustainability and education.

<h3>INTRODUCING THE SENNEN AUTOMATIC  </h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590139289/glsa2roqtsz6pjujcq5u.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>A modern tribute to classic timepieces, offering a rich collision of design, with dials that embody the powerful colours of the mighty Cornish coast and a case honouring the elegance of vintage pocket watches.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590139321/ayfphc38he1ywxhaqa8u.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>ABOUT THE SENNEN AUTOMATIC</h3>
<p>Firle's debut model, the Sennen Automatic, is a wristwatch that takes design inspiration from some of the best watchmakers in the world such as FP Journe, IWC, Cartier, Laurent Ferrier, and H. Moser.</p>
<p>The Sennen takes its name from the Cornish Cove located on mainland England’s most westerly point - Land's End. Exposed, it takes a battering from the most extreme conditions. The result is one of the most beautiful, contrasting landscapes in the world. Sennen and Cornwall have, in my eyes, always been a place of staggering beauty and power. A haven which as a surfer, or a nature lover, you can get completely lost in. Ultimately, it is a place of inspiration and reflection. This captivating coast provided me with a space to create the framework and design for the Sennen Watch by Firle. </p>
<p> </p>
<h3>FEATURED ON </h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590139352/iyg74sjfudagxokpy6sh.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<h3>THE DESIGN​  </h3>
<p>The Sennen Automatic's design is entirely unique; every part of it designed with absolute intent to create an incomparable piece.  </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590139421/thz4owrdglki1kcgd39d.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE CASE -</strong> The Sennen Automatic case features a beautifully rounded 41mm case, modelled after traditional pocket watches produced by watchmakers like Waltham and Breguet. </p>
<p>Seeing rounded cases is rare nowadays, this could be due to the difficulties in trying to create a flawless transition between lug and case. This was a detail that took me many months to perfect -a seemingly impossible task but it was vital for me to do this as I believe rounded cases are the embodiment of exceptional design. Not only does a rounded case ensure comfort, but it is a wonderfully simple expression of nature.</p>
<p>The 41mm 316L stainless steel case could only be perfected if it were entirely polished.  Which I feel combined with its shape, exudes traditional watchmaking values and transports you back to the era of classic pocket watches.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590139480/wecwpxffv0xovxlv22sz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE CRYSTAL -</strong> Committed to the utmost quality, the Sennen features an extremely high-grade scratch-resistant double-domed sapphire crystal, rather than the more common single-dome sapphire or mineral glass. This ensures that the watch can be viewed from any angle without creating any distortion of the dial. Furthermore, double-domed sapphire crystal increases the light luminosity on the dial, which creates a magnificent, radiant effect.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590139523/y5pzskq75bta8x6v7ciz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE CASE BACK -</strong> The Sennen features an open case-back revealing the beautiful STP1-11 movement through a flat high-grade sapphire crystal. The case-back is held in place via six titanium screws. Furthermore, the watch is water-resistant up to 10ATM - 100 Meters / 330 Feet.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590139566/gtlghc88mjmjuqru4rjx.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>THE DIAL -</strong> I wanted the dials to reflect the deep, saturated colours of the rugged coastline that I’ve come to love. The eerie blacks of the rock formations, the deep blues of the Atlantic Ocean, the whites of the sea foam and sand, and the greens that cover the coastline.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590139600/mfez71dtrlw22znmm1fk.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The only way to truly replicate the vivid depth of these tones was by using enamel on the dial surface. Not too dissimilar to the grand feu method of enamelling, the enamel used on the Sennen uses a mixture of enamel glaze and fine glass compounds, which are repeatedly applied, heated and polished to achieve a perfect finish. The enamel provides the rich colours and the glass provides a shine comparable to the sun reflecting off the ocean. All of these different elements, weighted and balanced to perfection, finish off the classic yet modern design of 'The Sennen'.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590139634/ygpdosicuy2xcflwrt2g.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p>This laborious project has taken me four years to complete, the necessary amount of time to create a watch in which every component is custom designed. From the unique case and lugs right down to the hand-placed indexes and Assegai inspired hands, every part of the Sennen was been pored over until it was perfect. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590139717/y2bykjfvgemfiv79fhmz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590139691/lcmhu2zy6bhjqjyexnzc.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>You might find similar, but you will not find the same design features on any other watch. This is what truly makes the Sennen a special, unmatched timepiece.  </p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>THE MOVEMENT </h3>
<p>The Sennen is powered by the Swiss-made calibre: STP1-11, an exquisite movement, specially selected for its thinness and quality. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590139747/huskyrvmj8bjdrzndwhp.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The STP1-11, at only 4.6mm, is one of the thinnest automatics on the market, allowing the Sennen to remain incredibly slim with a case thickness of 10.4mm, or 11.7mm with the double-domed sapphire crystal. This ensures it sits extremely well on the wrist, without being at all cumbersome.</p>
<p>The STP1-11 is a high precision movement that operates at 28'800 vibrations per hour, 4 Hz and offers a 44-hour power reserve. The movement has a Perlage finish, and the rotor has a Côte de Geneve finish engraved with the Firle logo.   </p>

<h3>OUR STORY </h3>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1590140294/yrmyaw25rrgk8zn12i84.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><i><strong>“For four years I have been tirelessly working to make this dream a reality. I believe I have achieved my goal of an exquisite, expertly crafted watch and an honest brand.”</strong></i></p>
<p> </p>
<p>In recent years, the watch industry has become oversaturated with supposed minimalist, ‘Bauhaus’ inspired quartz watches featuring low-cost and low-quality components. Consumers are, understandably, drawn to these watches because of affordability -a factor not commonly found in the watch industry.</p>
<p>Many of these brands centre around extravagant marketing, which promotes affluent and idealistic lifestyles that are simply unattainable for the average consumer. The visions fed to customers do not match their brand offering.</p>
<p>I have to admit; I was fooled by this too. However, I soon realised there was a much more beautiful and honest way of doing things, which would honour the essence of watchmaking.</p>
<p>After taking a closer look at the watch industry, I realised there was a massive gap in the market between the low-cost, low-quality offerings and the exorbitantly priced, good-quality brands.</p>
<p>This pushed me to start thinking about the sort of watch that the industry was lacking.</p>
<p>I was inspired by the need to create an honest and timeless brand, incorporating world-class components of highly complex mechanics, yet which falls into an affordable price bracket.</p>
<p>Through my research, I became infatuated with mechanical movement. I firmly believe that mechanical watches are the only timepieces worth owning. A smooth sweeping second hand on the surface and an intricate marvel of interactions going on within the watch case that completely capture the imagination. I have dreamt about designing and creating a truly exceptional timepiece that does not represent a symbol of grandiosity but is a testament to the true art of watchmaking.</p>

</div></div>","ABOUT FIRLE 
“A powerful heritage design honouring traditional watchmaking. Painstakingly sculpted using the finest materials.” 

 
Firle Watches takes its name from the Old English word fierol, meaning oak-covered land - a name that carries strength and integrity and a name that embodies our British heritage and landscape. The coastline that surrounds us here can often be fierce and powerful. These are the days we most look forward to – they force us to escape, and they bring with them possibility.
The fine movements in our watches are every bit as rugged, powerful and beautiful as the ocean and landscape from which we draw our inspiration. Firle watches are for admirers of mechanical perfection, lovers of adventure - and lovers of life.
In much the same way, we believe our timepieces will come to embody the story of those who wear them. They are designed to be with you for the whole journey.  
 
OUR PROMISE 

 
At Firle, we are passionate about the Ocean, it's the source of our inspiration and it's a place that provides us with a huge amount of joy. We believe it is the responsibility of both consumers and companies to minimise our impact on the environment. Which is we have decided to donate £5 from the sale of every Firle timepiece to the charity Plastic Oceans. Plastic Oceans is a leading ocean clean-up initiative that aims to reduce the amount of plastic pollution in our oceans through science, sustainability and education. (More can be found on Plastic Oceans and our £5 promise at the bottom of our campaign).
 
 
INTRODUCING THE SENNEN AUTOMATIC  

 
A modern tribute to classic timepieces, offering a rich collision of design, with dials that embody the powerful colours of the mighty Cornish coast and a case honouring the elegance of vintage pocket watches.
 

 
ABOUT THE SENNEN AUTOMATIC
Firle's debut model, the Sennen Automatic, is a wristwatch that takes design inspiration from some of the best watchmakers in the world such as FP Journe, IWC, Cartier, Laurent Ferrier, and H. Moser.
The Sennen takes its name from the Cornish Cove located on mainland England’s most westerly point - Land's End. Exposed, it takes a battering from the most extreme conditions. The result is one of the most beautiful, contrasting landscapes in the world. Sennen and Cornwall have, in my eyes, always been a place of staggering beauty and power. A haven which as a surfer, or a nature lover, you can get completely lost in. Ultimately, it is a place of inspiration and reflection. This captivating coast provided me with a space to create the framework and design for the Sennen Watch by Firle. 
 
FEATURED ON 

 
THE DESIGN​  
The Sennen Automatic's design is entirely unique; every part of it designed with absolute intent to create an incomparable piece.  

 
THE CASE - The Sennen Automatic case features a beautifully rounded 41mm case, modelled after traditional pocket watches produced by watchmakers like Waltham and Breguet. 
Seeing rounded cases is rare nowadays, this could be due to the difficulties in trying to create a flawless transition between lug and case. This was a detail that took me many months to perfect -a seemingly impossible task but it was vital for me to do this as I believe rounded cases are the embodiment of exceptional design. Not only does a rounded case ensure comfort, but it is a wonderfully simple expression of nature.
The 41mm 316L stainless steel case could only be perfected if it were entirely polished.  Which I feel combined with its shape, exudes traditional watchmaking values and transports you back to the era of classic pocket watches.  
 

 
THE CRYSTAL - Committed to the utmost quality, the Sennen features an extremely high-grade scratch-resistant double-domed sapphire crystal, rather than the more common single-dome sapphire or mineral glass. This ensures that the watch can be viewed from any angle without creating any distortion of the dial. Furthermore, double-domed sapphire crystal increases the light luminosity on the dial, which creates a magnificent, radiant effect.  
 

 
THE CASE BACK - The Sennen features an open case-back revealing the beautiful STP1-11 movement through a flat high-grade sapphire crystal. The case-back is held in place via six titanium screws. Furthermore, the watch is water-resistant up to 10ATM - 100 Meters / 330 Feet.  
 

 
THE DIAL - I wanted the dials to reflect the deep, saturated colours of the rugged coastline that I’ve come to love. The eerie blacks of the rock formations, the deep blues of the Atlantic Ocean, the whites of the sea foam and sand, and the greens that cover the coastline.  
 

 
The only way to truly replicate the vivid depth of these tones was by using enamel on the dial surface. Not too dissimilar to the grand feu method of enamelling, the enamel used on the Sennen uses a mixture of enamel glaze and fine glass compounds, which are repeatedly applied, heated and polished to achieve a perfect finish. The enamel provides the rich colours and the glass provides a shine comparable to the sun reflecting off the ocean. All of these different elements, weighted and balanced to perfection, finish off the classic yet modern design of 'The Sennen'.  
 


 
This laborious project has taken me four years to complete, the necessary amount of time to create a watch in which every component is custom designed. From the unique case and lugs right down to the hand-placed indexes and Assegai inspired hands, every part of the Sennen was been pored over until it was perfect. 
 


 
You might find similar, but you will not find the same design features on any other watch. This is what truly makes the Sennen a special, unmatched timepiece.  
 
THE MOVEMENT 
The Sennen is powered by the Swiss-made calibre: STP1-11, an exquisite movement, specially selected for its thinness and quality. 

 
The STP1-11, at only 4.6mm, is one of the thinnest automatics on the market, allowing the Sennen to remain incredibly slim with a case thickness of 10.4mm, or 11.7mm with the double-domed sapphire crystal. This ensures it sits extremely well on the wrist, without being at all cumbersome.
The STP1-11 is a high precision movement that operates at 28'800 vibrations per hour, 4 Hz and offers a 44-hour power reserve. The movement has a Perlage finish, and the rotor has a Côte de Geneve finish engraved with the Firle logo.   
 


 
 
THE STRAPS   
 All of our Sennen Automatic watches come with either:
1. A faux crocodile print leather strap (genuine leather)  or 
2. A smooth Italian leather strap (genuine leather)


 
 
THINKING OF ADDITIONAL STRAPS?   

 
VINTAGE COWHIDE STRAPS (sold separately)
The Sennen Automatic can also be beautifully paired with our Vintage Cowhide Straps, which are designed to show signs of ageing and distress -perfect for giving your watch a rugged look and feel. A characteristic I am personally fond of. Please note these are not included with the watch but can be ordered separately.
Available in Cognac (pictured on the left) and Light Brown (pictured on the right).  
 


 
 
TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS


 
 
PACKAGING​ 

 
We believe the initial presentation of your watch is extremely important. We also felt if we built something well enough, you would want to keep it – which is a more sustainable approach.
Our presentation boxes are crafted from veneered Oak and MDF.  The inside of our boxes are lined using a luxury grey felt and are stamped with our gold foil Firle logo.
Firle watches come with a beautifully illustrated user guide and a 2 or 5 warranty card.
We wanted to take a more sustainable route with the rest of our packaging – our strap boxes, user guide, warranty card, shipping boxes, packaging tape and labels are all 100% recyclable.
Our promise to reduce as much plastic as possible is implemented all along the way: our watches don’t arrive with dust stickers and our packaging filler and label pouches are also all 100% biodegradable/compostable.     
 

 
 
WARRANTY
Firle watches are made to last long into the future.
The Sennen Automatic timepieces have been made using the highest quality components and materials by our rigorous and skilful manufacturers.
Firle Watches are guaranteed against any manufacturing defects for a period of 24 months from the date of purchase. Please note the warranty does not cover any damage on any part of the watch resulting from abnormal use, lack of care, negligence, accidents, incorrect use of the watch and non-observance of the directions provided by Firle Watches.
No. 001 WARRANTY
No. 001 Sennen Automatics come with an exclusive 5-year warranty.
All Firle watches will be personally inspected before shipment and will be accompanied with a Firle warranty card.
 
 
OUR STORY 

 
“For four years I have been tirelessly working to make this dream a reality. I believe I have achieved my goal of an exquisite, expertly crafted watch and an honest brand.”
 
In recent years, the watch industry has become oversaturated with supposed minimalist, ‘Bauhaus’ inspired quartz watches featuring low-cost and low-quality components. Consumers are, understandably, drawn to these watches because of affordability -a factor not commonly found in the watch industry.
Many of these brands centre around extravagant marketing, which promotes affluent and idealistic lifestyles that are simply unattainable for the average consumer. The visions fed to customers do not match their brand offering.
I have to admit; I was fooled by this too. However, I soon realised there was a much more beautiful and honest way of doing things, which would honour the essence of watchmaking.
After taking a closer look at the watch industry, I realised there was a massive gap in the market between the low-cost, low-quality offerings and the exorbitantly priced, good-quality brands.
This pushed me to start thinking about the sort of watch that the industry was lacking.
I was inspired by the need to create an honest and timeless brand, incorporating world-class components of highly complex mechanics, yet which falls into an affordable price bracket.
Through my research, I became infatuated with mechanical movement. I firmly believe that mechanical watches are the only timepieces worth owning. A smooth sweeping second hand on the surface and an intricate marvel of interactions going on within the watch case that completely capture the imagination. I have dreamt about designing and creating a truly exceptional timepiece that does not represent a symbol of grandiosity but is a testament to the true art of watchmaking.

Many tried to create a device called smartwatch. As we think, there is no one in the world, who figured out, what a smartwatch should be.First of all, we have got an idea! We haven't made any prototype, yet. But we believe, that we can do it. You can check below, who we are.We think, a true smartwatch should be still a WATCH. A watch with physical face, true hands and beautiful look. It should last years, and works at least couple of days. Classic look and couple of smart functions - this is the key. We don't need another device for browsing/gaming/writing/talking and consuming. It should be really extension, which should seamlessly connect with our other devices (phones/computers etc). We plan to create interfaces for iOS/Android/Windows and web interface to sync watch without the phone around.We are starting this campaign to get funds to speed up our research and prototyping. If we will succeed with fully working prototype, we will start to raising funds for production start. We have called it be-watch, because it will BE a WATCH, in first place,Below You can see some of first attempts to create a model.Our Dream. Below You can see, what is our DREAM.  A Watch is a jewelery. There are some companies, that seems to understand this. Unfortunately most of smartwatches are simply ugly.Creating hybrid watch face, with e-ink display below, extended by classic watch face materials, will allow to make extraordinary looking watch.  Maybe we can use many materials to create watch...   From the beginning we were excited to project a device, which will seamlessly integrate with Your life.  Technology.We want it to look like a watch. And most of all; we want it to show the hour! Instantly. A watch MUST provide its name function. And it should work as long as classic watch. Raising your wrist couple of times to see an hour? Blaaaah...First, It MUST BE a watch! Second: it can do smart things.Our smartwatch will last for years and will always look great, never geeky or childish.   Actual trend shows, that producers want to give us little smartphones on our wirsts. Fact is, that We need only limited information at such small screen. There is no need to change layout of watch hands, if there is a beautiful one. We be There is no need to display distracting information. We need classic look with smart extensions for Your smartphone.  Our device will work with every smartphone...

</h3>
<p>
</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Hundreds of millions travel each year by air, rail, land and sea. Until now, packing and protecting valuables, toiletries and other travel necessities meant placing most (if not all) items into a bag where they are loose, can break, or are difficult
to find.<span>  Liquids spill and soil other articles,
and sometimes, leak through the bag onto clothing and other travel items. Added to that, is the need for several bags because
toiletries and other necessities won’t fit into just one bag or case. </span></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src="""" src="""" style=""""/>Introducing the Travel Chest, a brand new way to pack, organize and protect
valuables and necessities during travel and at home (a product of <b><i><a href=""http://www.myfavoritethings-u3i.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">“My Favorite Things By K. Louise™.”</a></i></b><span>).   With this innovative product category in the luggage industry there is:<br/></span></p>
<ul><li>
<span>No more wrapping bottles to keep them from
breaking or cracking.</span> <br/>
</li></ul>
<span></span><ul><li><span>No more travel items scattered inside the suitcase or lost in a bag.  </span></li></ul>
<ul><li><span>And most importantly, no more having to pack
several bags to accommodate all needed toiletry, health, grooming, and beauty
products.</span></li></ul>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><br/></h3>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">The Travel Chest is built to last.<br/>
</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Its name, <a href=""http://media.wix.com/ugd/dac0fa_f02799295c1a4fdcb0ce90d2a229854d.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Travel Chest</a>, infers that it's more than just a travel case or bag.  It’s a premier travel system that provides
the space and convenience of organizing and packing important travel valuables
and necessities for both long and short trips. 
The Travel Chest makes the packing and travel experience easy and
complete. </p>
<p>The Travel Chest prevents liquids from
spilling, and all items from shifting, breaking, cracking or being crushed
during every mode of travel.  Compared to
existing travel cases or bags marketed today, the Travel Chest holds both
trial/travel-sized items, as well as some full-sized items.  Deep compartments allow items to stack and
stay secure during transport.  <br/></p>
<p>The chest is made of a lightweight ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) material, is durable, has waterproof properties, is stress-crack resistance, and when full, can
weigh between only 3 and 7 pounds depending on <a href=""http://media.wix.com/ugd/dac0fa_b920af0e968e430e819537bc2030f02d.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">contents</a>.<br/></p>
<p>The removable foam insert is made of an expanded polyethylene (EPE) material that is flexible, 
durable, cushioning and has a high-load capacity.  Other characteristics
 include impact, bacteria, mold, grease, chemical, oil
and solvent resistance. It is soft
enough to provide flexibility, but dense enough to provide cushion for 
even the
heaviest of items.  It can also hold up to extended periods of moisture.<br/></p>
<p><br/></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Attractive, stylish and can be custom designed <br/>
</h3>
<p>The Travel Chest currently comes
in two sizes (large and small) which fit conveniently in any size luggage.  <br/></p>

<br/><h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Users and uses of the Travel Chest</h3>
<p>The Travel Chest can be
enjoyed by men, women and children of all ages who travel by air, rail, land or sea.  Some <a href=""http://media.wix.com/ugd/dac0fa_61a3bf334ef445b888910cef74c9d8a5.pdf"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">uses</a> include:</p>

<p>One of the greatest benefits of using the Travel Chest is that it is an amazing space saver. It takes up little space in a packed suitcase.  It can hang in an opened or closed position from any door handle, closet rod  or shower rod.  It can sit neatly on a bathroom countertop or shelf.  Or it can sit in a dorm room or in a tractor trailer sleeper in a small area.<br/></p>

basic purpose is to hold toiletry and sundry items for everyday health, grooming

are many options on the market today for packing toiletries, however, they don’t
provide the added protection and organization as the Travel Chest.<span> </span></span><br/><br/><p>To
bring the <i><b>“My Favorite Things By K. Louise™”</b></i> Travel Chest to market, I am
seeking contributions totaling $150,000.00 USD (one hundred and fifty thousand
dollars) to build inventory for sales via the company website, retail and Amazon.com, for licensing agreements, marketing, branding, as well as funding for packaging and distribution.  The Travel Chest has been issued a provisional utility patent by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), and we will be applying for full patent protection in the U.S. and internationally.<br/></p>

discounts are the main perk of the Travel Chest.  This includes discounts for families who
travel and carry individual luggage, traveling employees, and other groups and
organizations.  As a bonus, every 100<sup>th</sup>

</div></div>","Packing and protecting valuables and travel necessities has never been so easy.




Hundreds of millions travel each year by air, rail, land and sea. Until now, packing and protecting valuables, toiletries and other travel necessities meant placing most (if not all) items into a bag where they are loose, can break, or are difficult
to find.  Liquids spill and soil other articles,
and sometimes, leak through the bag onto clothing and other travel items. Added to that, is the need for several bags because
toiletries and other necessities won’t fit into just one bag or case. 
Introducing the Travel Chest, a brand new way to pack, organize and protect
valuables and necessities during travel and at home (a product of “My Favorite Things By K. Louise™.”).   With this innovative product category in the luggage industry there is:

No more wrapping bottles to keep them from
breaking or cracking. 

No more travel items scattered inside the suitcase or lost in a bag.  
And most importantly, no more having to pack
several bags to accommodate all needed toiletry, health, grooming, and beauty
products.

The Travel Chest is built to last.


Its name, Travel Chest, infers that it's more than just a travel case or bag.  It’s a premier travel system that provides
the space and convenience of organizing and packing important travel valuables
and necessities for both long and short trips. 
The Travel Chest makes the packing and travel experience easy and
complete. 
The Travel Chest prevents liquids from
spilling, and all items from shifting, breaking, cracking or being crushed
during every mode of travel.  Compared to
existing travel cases or bags marketed today, the Travel Chest holds both
trial/travel-sized items, as well as some full-sized items.  Deep compartments allow items to stack and
stay secure during transport.  
The chest is made of a lightweight ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) material, is durable, has waterproof properties, is stress-crack resistance, and when full, can
weigh between only 3 and 7 pounds depending on contents.
The removable foam insert is made of an expanded polyethylene (EPE) material that is flexible, 
durable, cushioning and has a high-load capacity.  Other characteristics
 include impact, bacteria, mold, grease, chemical, oil
and solvent resistance. It is soft
enough to provide flexibility, but dense enough to provide cushion for 
even the
heaviest of items.  It can also hold up to extended periods of moisture.

Attractive, stylish and can be custom designed 

The Travel Chest currently comes
in two sizes (large and small) which fit conveniently in any size luggage.  

There are nine popular colors and patterns that match most luggage sets sold in the world today.  However, corporations, organizations, schools, athletic teams and other institutions can order the Travel Chest in their custom colors and designs with quantities of 500 or more.  
The removable foam insert comes in six colors to accent the outer chest for added style and customization. 


And for that extra special touch, personal monograms, corporate logos, school mascots, as well as family crests can be added for ultimate in customization.                    
                
Users and uses of the Travel Chest
The Travel Chest can be
enjoyed by men, women and children of all ages who travel by air, rail, land or sea.  Some uses include:


Gifts for all holidays and special
occasions 

Dorm rooms and showers

Corporate giveaways

Purchase giveaways (e.g., RV sales, packaging for multiple-item gifts, etc.)

Professionals whose work requires
overnight stays (e.g., firemen, medical)
Long-haul and short-haul truck drivers


Sleepovers

Gym, spa, pool, beach or park

Traveling athletic teams

Camping, boating, recreational vehicle
trips

Daily use in home bathrooms

Home use to protect valuables

One of the greatest benefits of using the Travel Chest is that it is an amazing space saver. It takes up little space in a packed suitcase.  It can hang in an opened or closed position from any door handle, closet rod  or shower rod.  It can sit neatly on a bathroom countertop or shelf.  Or it can sit in a dorm room or in a tractor trailer sleeper in a small area.

Competitors of the Travel Chest 
A toiletry case or bag of
some kind is used by passengers regardless of their mode of transport.  While travel cases
and bags come in a wide variety of sizes, shapes, colors, and styles, their
basic purpose is to hold toiletry and sundry items for everyday health, grooming
and beauty needs.  The most common competitors of the Travel Chest include the:





                                                                  

Use of contributions to the Travel Chest campaignContributions to the Travel Chest campaign will provide funding for a product that gives travelers the best organization
and protection of their packed valuables and necessities. There
are many options on the market today for packing toiletries, however, they don’t
provide the added protection and organization as the Travel Chest. To
bring the “My Favorite Things By K. Louise™” Travel Chest to market, I am
seeking contributions totaling $150,000.00 USD (one hundred and fifty thousand
dollars) to build inventory for sales via the company website, retail and Amazon.com, for licensing agreements, marketing, branding, as well as funding for packaging and distribution.  The Travel Chest has been issued a provisional utility patent by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), and we will be applying for full patent protection in the U.S. and internationally.


Quantity
discounts are the main perk of the Travel Chest.  This includes discounts for families who
travel and carry individual luggage, traveling employees, and other groups and
organizations.  As a bonus, every 100th
Travel Chest ordered receives one free.  Customized MFT luggage tags and/or a MFT engraved nickel-plated key charm is added to each order.

Passenger travel in 2014
in the U.S. included over 640 million by air, 252 million by rail, 410 million
by bus, 20.3 million by sea, and over 16.7 billion miles traveled by road.*  And according to trade group, Airlines
America, air travel for the summer 2015 alone will reach over 222 million. For each passenger a bag or case was used.  (*Sources: U.S. Department of Transportation and Amtrak at September 2014) 
 Risks and challenges to consider

The
Travel Chest is designed by Tetrafab Custom Cases in Floyd Knobs, Indiana and manufactured in China.  The foam insert is manufactured by Clark Foam Products Corporation in Bolingbrook, Illinois with a plant in Louisville, Kentucky.  The assembly and distribution are conducted in Bolingbrook, Illinois.  Foreseeable risks and challenges could
include manufacturing or shipment delays. 



Our promise to each contributor
U3I
will go above and beyond the call to ensure that Travel Chests are received as
promised.  One way to mitigate delays
will be to have shipments made in smaller quantities in order to receive as
many as possible in shorter time frames. 
Also, if necessary, use air shipping.With regard to quality control, Tetrafab’s
promise:

“We pride ourselves on a
100% satisfied client base. Our impeccable quality control is a major
contributor to our reputation as an industry leader in custom case design and
production. Our QC team is on-site at the plants inspecting both the raw
materials, and finished products to a military standard ensuring that zero
defect products are delivered to our customers. If a single issue is found in
an inspection sample, the entire production run gets checked by hand because we
are fully committed to perfect quality.
Our average customer
relationship is more than eight years, and we are proud of that. Our dedication
to quality is one of the reasons why we enjoy such a high client retention
rate. We 100% guarantee that you will be satisfied with our custom cases.
That’s our promise, our mission statement, and our oath to each and every one
of our customers.”
U3I
will conduct an additional inspection on each Travel Chest to ensure that
zippers open and close properly, the body has held its shape, foam insert fits
securely, rubber feet are properly adhered, the handle, hook and inside pocket
are secure, and all hardware is connected properly.  

In reference to Clark Foam Products Corporation:
""A company dedicated to fabricating
 foam products for many industries since 1951.  As then, Clark Foam is 
now a leader in new foam products, innovative cutting techniques, and 
computer designed foam products that are more efficient and at less cost
 to a wide spectrum of manufacturers.

We started this century at a new 80,000 square foot facility in 
Bolingbrook, Illinois and added 35,000 square foot facility in 
Louisville, Kentucky with state-of-the-art cutting equipment that can 
produce intricate shapes and sizes in a wide variety of foams, blended 
rubber and vinyls, natural sponge rubber, and synthetic fiber."" 


Other ways you can help
U3I
understands that there are less expensive and viable solutions for transporting
valuables and toiletries, and the Travel Chest (while appropriately priced) is slightly
more expensive than the shower caddy or other toiletry bags.  If this is not a solution for you, please use
your social media and other contacts to let your family, friends and associates
know about the Travel Chest.  This could
very well be the travel solution they’ve been looking for.  Indiegogo share tools can also be very helpful.

<p>The original Tallboy Tee offers the best fit for the tall man.

<p><strong style=""font-weight: bold;"">Fit</strong><br/>Featuring longer length and longer sleeves, we just dare you to try and shrink this bad boy in the wash. The hood is larger and sits taller for an unrestricted range of motion. Sleeves are slim fitting and comfortably hug the arms.<br/></p>

<p><strong style=""font-weight: bold;"">Fabric</strong><br/>We take durability seriously. Tallboy Hoodies and Sweaters are made with anti-pilling treated fabric. 'Pilling' is the formation of small balls of fibers that can gather on the surface after extensive use and washing. This treatment stops this from ever happening so your hoodie stays looking fresh wash after wash.<br/></p>

<strong style=""font-weight: bold;"">Design</strong><br/>We take a different approach to design to create a look that complements a taller frame. The inner pocket is lifted, allowing the wearer to comfortably rest their hands while maintaining an upright posture. To create a proportioned look we have doubled the upper back panel to square off the shoulders. <br/>

<p>As a tall boy (6'3), finding clothes that fit is an ongoing problem. Tees are always too short, shirts are often too baggy and sleeves are never long enough.</p>
<p>In 2013 I launched 'Tallboys Apparel' with the aim of filling this void in the market and I developed my first product, the 'Tallboy Tee'. The t-shirt was longer in length, had a fitted chest and slim sleeves. A product that vertically gifted men across the globe now know and love because of its great fit and make quality.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1472030546/nick-bball_opteip.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>This year I want to bring you more Tallboys gear! I’ve worked with some incredibly talented people to re-imagine a selection of wardrobe essentials, based on the reviews and feedback I’ve received over the years. With no compromise on fabric or make quality, each piece is designed to last so you can feel comfortable, stand tall and look great.In order to manufacture the complete range of styles and colors, I'm going to need your help. With your pre-orders, we can reach the manufacturer minimums and make the Tall Basics range a reality. In return for your support, I am offering exclusive discounts on the entire collection. </p>
<p>A big thank you to everyone that has supported Tallboys over the years. I couldn’t have got this far without you.</p>

<p>We've been delivering to customers for over 3 years now, manufactured 6 times and now stock in the US, Canada and Australia to deliver faster than ever.</p>
<p>Timely order fulfillment is a huge priority. Our manufacturer is ready to start production as soon as we reach our goal. With freight and fulfillment already organised, items will start to ship in December. Unfortunately we can’t guarantee the items to arrive before Christmas but if you are buying it as a gift for that tall friend/family member, we can provide you with a voucher which is redeemable on the website  for their choice of color and style. </p>
<p>Delays can happen from time to time. If for any reason there are hiccups with the production or delivery, you will be the first know. As a pledger, you can expect frequent updates regarding the campaign and our progress.</p>

Looking forward to seeing what you guys produce in the future and a big thanks from Australia!"" – Jordan W.

Available in Crew and V-Neck


The original Tallboy Tee offers the best fit for the tall man. Unlike regular T-shirts that are usually too short or too wide, they are specifically designed to complement a tall frame and encourage great posture. With long wear in mind, they are made with comfort stretch fabric designed to maintain shape wash after wash.







FitMade with extra body length, you can say goodbye to the awkward exposure of the male midriff for good. They also feature slim sleeves and a fitted chest, to keep you looking proportioned.



FabricThe cotton fabric contains a small amount of spandex providing a 'comfort stretch'. This allows for a slim fit design with an unrestricted range of motion and avoids stretching out of shape after repetitive use and washing.

DesignTallboy Tees are not only designed to fit, but complement a taller frame. The unique shape creates a proportioned look so you can feel comfortable, stand tall and look great. 
See further below for sizing and dimensions.








Tallboy Sweaters are specifically designed for a tall physique and built to last. The fabric is thick, soft and treated so it won't pill. Each section is tailored and shaped to fit in a way that feels comfortable and encourages great posture. With no visible branding, they layer well with jackets and coats.





FitFeaturing longer length and longer sleeves, we just dare you to try and shrink this bad boy in the wash. The crew neck collar is made from durable rib fabric that will maintain shape after extensive use. The sleeves are slim fitting and comfortably hug the arms.

FabricWe take durability seriously. Tallboy Hoodies and Sweaters are made with anti-pilling treated fabric. 'Pilling' is the formation of small balls of fibers that can gather on the surface after extensive use and washing. This treatment stops this from ever happening so your hoodie stays looking fresh wash after wash.

DesignThe body length and neck opening are designed to pair seamlessly with a Tallboy Tee and the upper back panel is doubled to square off the shoulders. Free of any visible branding, they also layer well with coats and jackets.

See further below for sizing and dimensions.










Tallboy Hoodies are specifically designed for a tall physique and built to last. The fabric is thick, soft and anti-pill treated.

FitFeaturing longer length and longer sleeves, we just dare you to try and shrink this bad boy in the wash. The hood is larger and sits taller for an unrestricted range of motion. Sleeves are slim fitting and comfortably hug the arms.

DesignWe take a different approach to design to create a look that complements a taller frame. The inner pocket is lifted, allowing the wearer to comfortably rest their hands while maintaining an upright posture. To create a proportioned look we have doubled the upper back panel to square off the shoulders. 


See further below for sizing and dimensions.









Tallboy Short Sleeves are the everyday versatile wardrobe staple. With no visible branding, they are suitable for formal settings or to be worn casually. Designed for durability, they are made with 100% cotton to ensure ultimate comfort and breathability.

As a tall boy (6'3), finding clothes that fit is an ongoing problem. Tees are always too short, shirts are often too baggy and sleeves are never long enough.
In 2013 I launched 'Tallboys Apparel' with the aim of filling this void in the market and I developed my first product, the 'Tallboy Tee'. The t-shirt was longer in length, had a fitted chest and slim sleeves. A product that vertically gifted men across the globe now know and love because of its great fit and make quality.

This year I want to bring you more Tallboys gear! I’ve worked with some incredibly talented people to re-imagine a selection of wardrobe essentials, based on the reviews and feedback I’ve received over the years. With no compromise on fabric or make quality, each piece is designed to last so you can feel comfortable, stand tall and look great.In order to manufacture the complete range of styles and colors, I'm going to need your help. With your pre-orders, we can reach the manufacturer minimums and make the Tall Basics range a reality. In return for your support, I am offering exclusive discounts on the entire collection. 
A big thank you to everyone that has supported Tallboys over the years. I couldn’t have got this far without you.

<p>Have you ever had a non-stop day that started at the gym/yoga studio, went straight to work and meetings, then to cocktails and dinner? </p>
<p>Have you ever packed your suitcase to the gills and kicked yourself at the end of the trip because you barely wore 1/2 of what you packed? </p>
<p>I'm no stranger to these scenarios but I found a way to fix them.</p>
<p>I am a mom, yoga teacher, fundraiser, amateur aerialist and I'm always looking for ways to reduce the amount of stuff I have. I love to express myself through fashion but most days can't be bothered to pick out new clothes. </p>
<p>I love that the <a href=""http://www.karmatrik.com"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Karma Trik</a> is 1 simple item that can be worn 15 ways, allowing us to express our mood and adjust to our surroundings in seconds. It lightens our closets, our suitcases, and our spirits. </p>
<p>The Karma Trik has no buttons, zippers, or straps that would constrain us. It fits the body and mood we are in at any moment. We don't have to fit into the Karma Trik.</p>
<p> It fits us. </p>

We change venues, moods, and sizes. Why shouldn't our clothes change with us? 


We can help women declutter and lighten their closets in a tangible way, while lightening the psychic weight that 'stuff' can cause as well. 
Funding this campaign will put this magic little garment into production and start helping more women lighten their lives. 
It's important we think about what we consume and this little garment that can be worn 15 ways helps remind us that we can use things we already have and don't need to accumulate more. 





Why Karma Trik? 
Have you ever had a non-stop day that started at the gym/yoga studio, went straight to work and meetings, then to cocktails and dinner? 
Have you ever packed your suitcase to the gills and kicked yourself at the end of the trip because you barely wore 1/2 of what you packed? 
I'm no stranger to these scenarios but I found a way to fix them.
I am a mom, yoga teacher, fundraiser, amateur aerialist and I'm always looking for ways to reduce the amount of stuff I have. I love to express myself through fashion but most days can't be bothered to pick out new clothes. 
I love that the Karma Trik is 1 simple item that can be worn 15 ways, allowing us to express our mood and adjust to our surroundings in seconds. It lightens our closets, our suitcases, and our spirits. 
The Karma Trik has no buttons, zippers, or straps that would constrain us. It fits the body and mood we are in at any moment. We don't have to fit into the Karma Trik.
 It fits us. 






Funding this campaign will scale up Karma Trik production from a kitchen floor to an employee owned co-op manufacturer in North Carolina. This will allow Karma Trik's reach to grow into retail stores. It will also allow for production of more patterns/colors, and development of more versatile products. 






   give your LOVE, You get Karma Trik  the supply chain is set up so you will receive your Karma Trik in two months after supporting, receiving your perks in time for MOTHER'S DAY
the $50K goal was arrived at by believing that if 1,000 people wanted a Karma Trik, the company would have traction, a working supply chain, and then the ability to move forward with confidence into the market. Your funding goes directly into the production of your Karma Trik. $50 will get you one Karma Trik More fun offers detailed in 'Perks'
If goal isn't reached, your money will be refunded











Who gets the LOVE?
 
Why have 15 things when we can have 1? Living simply has become the goal of many mindful, eco-conscious citizens of the world. 
Gandhi said, ""Live simply so that others can simply live."" The Karma Trik is made responsibly on a sustainable supply chain. The fabric is made using 15 recycled plastic bottles that were collected in Haiti. 


With child labor, sweat shops, and overseas production responsible for so much of the fashion industry, it is critical to me that the Karma Trik be made in America by adults being paid fairly. 

I took sustainability as a core mission right to the fabric source and partnered with Thread. A Certified B Corporation, Thread makes fabric from bottles collected from the streets and neighborhoods of Haiti and Honduras. Those bottles are collected, processed into flake, and then shipped to the US where it is made into fabric - supporting a network of over 3,500 income opportunities.




   shake & kiss...
...the dice. 
This campaign will help clarify whether or not the product is right for market as is or whether I need to iterate. I'm ready to evaluate this objectively and move forward accordingly. If I learned anything at MIT, it was to listen to what users want and answer their needs. If the Karma Trik doesn't solve the problem of too much stuff by lightening your load with its versatility, I will reevaluate and listen to your feedback. 
I am totally confident in the supply chain and my partners. So I will listen to you to make Karma Trik the best it can be. 
   you love this, but ....

you can't contribute now. That's cool, check out the perks and see that there's even a $3 option. You can still help by sharing this campaign with your friends.

<h3>Carabiner Eyewear presents Carabiner Sunglasses for the outdoor lifestyle.</h3>
<p>Carabiner Eyewear presents our new Carabiner Sunglasses: perfect for the outdoor lifestyle!</p>
<p>The functional and innovative design is not only patented by our inventor and CEO Sam Shapiro — it’s already been implemented, licensed, and sold under the <i><strong>Columbia Sportswear</strong></i>  sporting goods brand.</p>
<p>The thing that makes Carabiner Sunglasses unique is <u>literally</u> in the name: a built-in carabiner.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502135681/qnw7agsqdp0bsxpr0485.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3><i><strong>""What’s a carabiner,"" you ask? </strong></i></h3>
<p>A carabiner is basically a D-shaped metal ring with a spring catch on one side. And our sunglasses have one built in to them, unlike any other sunglass on the market today!</p>
<p>We’ve all seen the carabiner keychains. And in their most common usages, carabiners are used for climbing, grappling, fishing, boating, and mountaineering. While you <i>yourself</i> can’t hang from our awesome built-in sunglass carabiners (<i><strong>duh!</strong></i>) — you <u>can</u> use our carabiner to hang your Carabiner Sunglasses just about anywhere they'll fit! </p>
<p>Pretty amazing, if we do say so ourselves. And we do say so. </p>
<p>So did Columbia Sportswear.</p>
<p>We hope you agree!</p>
<p>This patented clip design makes it easy for busy, active people everywhere to hang your sunglasses from your belt loop, fisherman's vest, beach bag, gym tote, duffle bag, laptop bag, bicycle, keychain, hunting gear, household hooks, shirt straps, or backpack. (Basically, just about anywhere!)</p>
<p>Our innovative carabiner design isn’t all we have to offer, either: the fit is great, and the lens technology is top-of-the-line in terms of glare reduction and polarization for your outdoor lifestyle. Our CEO Sam Shapiro has a proven track-record when it comes to leading successful brands like Eye Deals Eyewear and Paws N Claws Eyewear, among others. As we said: he even licensed this patent to Columbia Sportswear, an international sporting goods brand. You'll learn more about Sam, our company, and our product's quality, below.</p>
<p>We are currently offering three color choices in our unisex Carabiner Sunglasses: black on black, electric blue, black, and grey, and dark brown with gold accents. </p>
<p><i><strong>Sunglass Size: 64-17-125. </strong></i></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502135695/vp8ok9f5boj5h8evqgtk.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<h3>Tough stuff for tough people.</h3>
<p>Durable, lightweight, and high-quality. That just about sums up our Carabiner Sunglasses. The sleek wraparound design is a style staple in athleisure wear and it's a must-have for all sporty types whether you're camping, fishing, hunting, running, or taking photos. But the quality of the frames and lenses is top-notch, too.</p>
<p>Our lens technologies feature a hard coat, 100% UVA and UVB blocker, and the polycarbonate lenses come in multiple colors with more soon to come. They are polarized with anti-glare technology. These polarized lenses are also high-definition, enhancing color and contrast while protecting those precious eyeballs! </p>
<p>The frames are awesome, too. We will feature double-injected molding with soft-rubbered temple tips and nice, strong nose padding for security and comfort during high-intensity activities. (Or just while lounging at the lake.)</p>
<p>Choose from three color combos: all black, black/grey/blue, or brown and gold.</p>
<p>Outdoor enthusiasts -- and those who just enjoy a good pair of sunglasses -- may love our wraparound style and quality lenses, but the key selling point is in our special, patented carabiner design (protected by US Patent <i>#7,938,533.</i>) The exclusive built-in carabiner permits men and women on the go to clip sunglasses just about anywhere for easy access and storage. </p>
<p>Don't lose your sunglasses ever again!</p>
<h3><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1502135710/wwo1nm3xnucgi1s0rllx.jpg"" src="""" style=""""/></h3>
<h3>It’s just that simple. Clip ‘em and go.</h3>
<p>With Carabiner Eyewear, you won’t have to worry about misplacing those darned sunglasses anymore!</p>
<p>Whether you’re surfing the beaches of Malibu, hiking the Appalachian trail, camping in Yosemite, birdwatching in Pennsylvania, fishing at your local pond, or being a tourist in your own city, Carabiner Sunglasses utilize a mindful, purposeful design that is well-suited for people on-the-go. </p>
<p>From photographers and rock climbers to campers, hunters, fishers, beachgoers, dog-owners, busy parents, absentminded teens, truck drivers, obstacle race competitors -- and even American Ninja Warriors like our friend and brand model Mike Shuck (pictured below,) Carabiner Sunglasses are a design you can cling to!</p>
<p>At the pool? Clip 'em to your tote bag. Need a break from snowboarding? Hang them while you enjoy a drink at the ski lodge. Clouds setting in while you fish? Clip 'em to your tackle box or your fishing vest. Busy people need useful things to help them stay organized while living everyday life -- whether that everyday life involves bouldering, book-worming, big game hunting, or beach-going.</p>
<p>There is a huge market out there just waiting to be served their next pair of quality-crafted, sensible sunglasses for the fit and functional, outdoorsy life.</p>
<p>There are about:</p>
<ul>
<li>50-million fishermen in the U.S.</li>
<li>6 million climbers.</li>
<li>12 million skiers.</li>
<li>41 million campers.</li>
<li>15 million boaters.</li>
<li>331 million people who visit national parks each year.</li>
<li>145 million Americans who participate in outdoor recreation each year.</li>
<li>Countless folks who misplace their shades.</li>
</ul>
<p>And 37 different brands that sell carabiners for fishing and climbing.</p>
<p>We're just the first brand to do it for eyewear.</p>
<p>Listen, the outdoor industry is booming. We're going to be part of that and we want <i><u><strong>you</strong></u></i> to join us. Let's make the great outdoors great again!</p>
<p>Consumers spend about $887 billion annually for outdoor recreation. This has generated 7.6 million jobs in 2016, plus $65.3 billion in federal tax revenue in recent years, and $59.2 billion in state and local tax revenue -- and these figures are <i><u>annual</u></i>!</p>
<p>But ... full disclosure? You don't even <i>*have*</i> to be an active, outdoorsy person to love our shades ... you just have to be someone who is sick of misplacing your go-to sunnies! </p>
<p>#Truth.</p>

<p>People need sunglasses. People like sunglasses. (And, in fact, about 25% of Americans use the internet to purchase their sunglasses, just like we're urging you to do today!)</p>

<p>And, well ... if you <u><i>still</i></u> worry you'll lose them, our consumer-friendly price point is low enough that you can purchase a backup pair or two. Or three. Just in case. </p>

We are looking for trend-setting, sporty, outdoorsy contributors like you to fund our Carabiner Sunglasses campaign. Please consider backing us -- and don't worry, we'll tell you why: 

Innovative, inventive, and useful product
Patented, sleek design
One-of-a-kind carabiner component
Quality lenses
Proven company track-record
Functional, purposeful, utilitarian, and fun
... and we are the only carabiner shades allowed on the market, due to our exclusive patent!


Carabiner Eyewear presents Carabiner Sunglasses for the outdoor lifestyle.
Carabiner Eyewear presents our new Carabiner Sunglasses: perfect for the outdoor lifestyle!
The functional and innovative design is not only patented by our inventor and CEO Sam Shapiro — it’s already been implemented, licensed, and sold under the Columbia Sportswear  sporting goods brand.
The thing that makes Carabiner Sunglasses unique is literally in the name: a built-in carabiner.

""What’s a carabiner,"" you ask? 
A carabiner is basically a D-shaped metal ring with a spring catch on one side. And our sunglasses have one built in to them, unlike any other sunglass on the market today!
We’ve all seen the carabiner keychains. And in their most common usages, carabiners are used for climbing, grappling, fishing, boating, and mountaineering. While you yourself can’t hang from our awesome built-in sunglass carabiners (duh!) — you can use our carabiner to hang your Carabiner Sunglasses just about anywhere they'll fit! 
Pretty amazing, if we do say so ourselves. And we do say so. 
So did Columbia Sportswear.
We hope you agree!
This patented clip design makes it easy for busy, active people everywhere to hang your sunglasses from your belt loop, fisherman's vest, beach bag, gym tote, duffle bag, laptop bag, bicycle, keychain, hunting gear, household hooks, shirt straps, or backpack. (Basically, just about anywhere!)
Our innovative carabiner design isn’t all we have to offer, either: the fit is great, and the lens technology is top-of-the-line in terms of glare reduction and polarization for your outdoor lifestyle. Our CEO Sam Shapiro has a proven track-record when it comes to leading successful brands like Eye Deals Eyewear and Paws N Claws Eyewear, among others. As we said: he even licensed this patent to Columbia Sportswear, an international sporting goods brand. You'll learn more about Sam, our company, and our product's quality, below.
We are currently offering three color choices in our unisex Carabiner Sunglasses: black on black, electric blue, black, and grey, and dark brown with gold accents. 
Sunglass Size: 64-17-125. 

Tough stuff for tough people.
Durable, lightweight, and high-quality. That just about sums up our Carabiner Sunglasses. The sleek wraparound design is a style staple in athleisure wear and it's a must-have for all sporty types whether you're camping, fishing, hunting, running, or taking photos. But the quality of the frames and lenses is top-notch, too.

Busy people need useful things to help them stay organized while living everyday life -- whether that everyday life involves bouldering, book-worming, big game hunting, or beach-going.
There is a huge market out there just waiting to be served their next pair of quality-crafted, sensible sunglasses for the fit and functional, outdoorsy life.
There are about:

50-million fishermen in the U.S.
6 million climbers.
12 million skiers.
41 million campers.
15 million boaters.
331 million people who visit national parks each year.
145 million Americans who participate in outdoor recreation each year.
Countless folks who misplace their shades.

<p>The fact that the best friends of the girls are diamonds, today everyone knows. Although in fact very few people really think about the benefits associated with the acquisition of diamonds. Thus, the most obvious advantage of such an acquisition is that you can not imagine a better gift than a diamond. Such a gift will win the heart of a loved one or make an impression on a business partner. And in any case, the presented diamonds will tell you about your taste, generosity and serious attitude. When buying diamonds, you get the opportunity to become the owner of exclusive jewelry and spend 2 or even 3 times less money than you have to pay when buying jewelry in the store. The quality of the diamond that you bought separately will exceed the quality of the stones displayed in the shop window in the form of jewelry.

<h3>What Is Jeenger</h3>
<p>Jeenger is made of a diverse set of folks with curious mind. We are keen to use technology and simplicity to improve overall quality of life of people worldwide. </p>
<p> 95% (~7 billon) of people in the world are effected by poor posture. Jeenger, a simple - yet technologically-advanced t-shirt - is designed to help gradually improve posture and resulting quality of life. Designed with ultra-light embedded sensors, Jeenger provides comfort and helps you enjoy your day while effortlessly enhancing your posture! </p>
<p>With your support of our funding campaign - by ordering a Smart T-Shirt for yourself or those you care about, Jeenger will make an outsized impact on the human well-being!</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>How It Works</h3>
<div><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/mzs7LW8RET0?autohide=1&amp;controls=1&amp;showinfo=0""></iframe></div></div>
<p> </p>
<p>We developed our product with two goals in mind: efficiency and simplicity. The Smart T-shirt has embedded sensors and a smart chip. An intuitive application helps you track your progress and compete with friends.</p>
<p>Bluetooth connection allows you to easily setup the chip: a short tap on the chip turns it on and a 3-second tap will shut it down. Sensors and the chip are two parts of one solution and work together. The chip takes measurements of the posture (information from the sensors)  every 5 seconds. When you slouch, sensors are stretching out, sending the signal to the chip. If you do not come back to upright position within 10 minutes - the gentle vibe (supplemented by an app notification) will remind you to mind the posture. If you correct your posture before 10 minutes pass, the chip starts taking measurements in the normal regime. </p>
<p>Yes, it is exactly that simple.</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>How It Is Better</h3>
<p>Our solution is more advanced than that of our competitors. Most devices out there have an inbuilt two-axis accelerometer that measures deviation from correct posture in vertical dimension only. Jeenger Smart T-shirt has a reversed T-shaped panel of conductive ink sensors that measure deviation from correct posture in both vertical and horizontal dimensions.</p>
<p>This makes our technology  more precise and smarter: it catches more variations of bad posture than the available posture trackers. And visa versa - Jeenger will not disturb you when your posture is good even if you are not in vertical position, for example, when you are exercising. For better understanding, let’s take a look at these examples: </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544390211/c2310mzmc9rc1vhxvrui.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Jeenger Smart T-shirt is more than a personalized high-precision posture correcting device. First and foremost, it is a comfortable t-shirt! Designed on material you'll love, our t-shirts are about to be essentials that you would want to wear everyday, with a focus on modern design, enduring style and top-notch quality. Jeenger has merged fashion and technology.  </p>

<h3>Where We Are &amp; What We Need</h3>
<p>After two years of product development, three prototypes, and fifty beta-testers, we are ready to finalise our Smart Posture T-shirt design and go into production! An early stage hardware startup is an existing yet costly journey, and to bring Jeenger to life we need your help.</p>
<p>With this Indiegogo campaign, we aim to raise EUR 35,000. We will use these funds to finalise the smart chip design and manufacture the first batch of the Smart T-shirts for our backers. </p>

<h3>Why We Do What We Do</h3>

Our answer was - and still is: We want it to write that we helped millions of people become healthier and happier. Yes, at Jeenger, we are aggressive about our ambition. </p>

<p>Thank you for being a part of our incredible journey to bring Jeenger to life! Please help us to make some noise about Jeenger campaign and tell your friends about us (you can use Indiegogo sharing tools in the top right corner of this page). Together we can make a difference!</p>
</div><p> </p></div>","What Is Jeenger
Jeenger is made of a diverse set of folks with curious mind. We are keen to use technology and simplicity to improve overall quality of life of people worldwide. 
 95% (~7 billon) of people in the world are effected by poor posture. Jeenger, a simple - yet technologically-advanced t-shirt - is designed to help gradually improve posture and resulting quality of life. Designed with ultra-light embedded sensors, Jeenger provides comfort and helps you enjoy your day while effortlessly enhancing your posture! 
With your support of our funding campaign - by ordering a Smart T-Shirt for yourself or those you care about, Jeenger will make an outsized impact on the human well-being!
 
How It Works

 
We developed our product with two goals in mind: efficiency and simplicity. The Smart T-shirt has embedded sensors and a smart chip. An intuitive application helps you track your progress and compete with friends.
Bluetooth connection allows you to easily setup the chip: a short tap on the chip turns it on and a 3-second tap will shut it down. Sensors and the chip are two parts of one solution and work together. The chip takes measurements of the posture (information from the sensors)  every 5 seconds. When you slouch, sensors are stretching out, sending the signal to the chip. If you do not come back to upright position within 10 minutes - the gentle vibe (supplemented by an app notification) will remind you to mind the posture. If you correct your posture before 10 minutes pass, the chip starts taking measurements in the normal regime. 
Yes, it is exactly that simple.
 
How It Is Better
Our solution is more advanced than that of our competitors. Most devices out there have an inbuilt two-axis accelerometer that measures deviation from correct posture in vertical dimension only. Jeenger Smart T-shirt has a reversed T-shaped panel of conductive ink sensors that measure deviation from correct posture in both vertical and horizontal dimensions.
This makes our technology  more precise and smarter: it catches more variations of bad posture than the available posture trackers. And visa versa - Jeenger will not disturb you when your posture is good even if you are not in vertical position, for example, when you are exercising. For better understanding, let’s take a look at these examples: 

Jeenger Smart T-shirt is more than a personalized high-precision posture correcting device. First and foremost, it is a comfortable t-shirt! Designed on material you'll love, our t-shirts are about to be essentials that you would want to wear everyday, with a focus on modern design, enduring style and top-notch quality. Jeenger has merged fashion and technology.  

 
Who We Are (Our Team)
We are a team of four. Together, we have all the expertise and experience to reach the project goals: engineering, marketing, fitness&health, business administration, finance, and entrepreneurship:


Tetiana: IESE MBA Class 2019, entrepreneur, lawyer, posture expert

Cedric: PhD, engineer, researcher, entrepreneur

Alexander: private equity investment manager

Owen: IESE MBA Class 2019, project director, business development and strategy manager


Clearly, it is not only four of us, but many other talented and passionate people who have helped and us during this journey. No one succeeds alone. And as a Thank-You, we imprinted names of Jeenger supporters on our logo. All two hundred sixty names. We thank each&everyone of you!


 
Where We Are & What We Need
After two years of product development, three prototypes, and fifty beta-testers, we are ready to finalise our Smart Posture T-shirt design and go into production! An early stage hardware startup is an existing yet costly journey, and to bring Jeenger to life we need your help.
With this Indiegogo campaign, we aim to raise EUR 35,000. We will use these funds to finalise the smart chip design and manufacture the first batch of the Smart T-shirts for our backers.

<p><strong>When will you receive your perk?</strong></p>
<p>Receiving your perk(s) often takes time! Selecting a perk as a part of your contribution is not the same thing as buying something online. The estimated delivery of perks is mentioned, and if the forces of nature are with us, we might be able to surprise you faster than that!</p>

<p><strong>How can you change your shipping information?</strong></p>

<p><strong>How do I select my perk details (e.g. t-shirt size, color)?</strong></p>
<p>If your perk asks for you to select an option, such as a shirt size or print name, please chose an option and contact us directly with your choice. In that case we can confirm it or offer another option if your first choice has been claimed, as each piece is very limited.</p>
<p><strong>Can you change your perk?</strong></p>
<p>Each contribution made is recorded as a separate contribution with a separate perk. If you would like to receive a new perk, you can do this in a separate contribution. If you'd like to upgrade your existing perk or select a different perk, please contact us. </p>
<p><strong>Can you claim multiple perks?</strong></p>

Established by Estonian-born mother and daughter creative duo, the unique, upcoming label fuses an assortment of colors and themes inspired by the hidden corners of the World.  The project is a  collaboration between textile laborers that go back generations, enthusiastic futurists and helping hands which prove to be instrumental in the overall craftsmanship that defines Relax Baby Be Cool. Tailor-made, using only high quality materials and mixing them with fabrics that carry in them stories and legends further contributes to the modern touch and exceptional quality that makes Relax Baby Be Cool what it is today.  
 

         
 The first Batik collection 'The Empire State of Mind' was designed using printed Indonesian Batik sarongs, that are locally worn in ceremonies as well as in every-day life. Made from 100% cotton with eye-catching colors and leather detailing, crafted with cool air, impressive attention to detail, and above all, passion.
Emphasizing the importance of the prints and the history behind them, all of the pieces are accompanied by the mythical tales portraying  the beliefs, the traditions and the way of life of the lost generations.
Beautiful, striking hues and atypical patterns that are accentuated through relaxed silhouettes, no-fuss cuts, and timeless clean Northern lines reflect the label’s aesthetics.
All collections are handmade, exclusive and limited due to a definite amount of each print and color.
             
 
“From the henna hands in the bright stalls of Jakarta, in the torn mochila over Singapore and Amsterdam, through the blue eyes of relentless seas with Estonian roots of knowledge and experience, Sparked from a situation, ironed with love, touched by the hands of a little magic, and pushed by the mountain.”
 
                    
 
What We Need & What You Get

Our aim is to find the gems from the clutter and give them a new life. 
With the incredible flight and unexpected success, we are also experiencing the constant need to grow and expand, and to keep up with our imagination. For that, we need more hands,     more heads and more support.
We are pushing our way to the map.
 
    
 
With a bit of help we can show our appreciation for our partners in the far corners of the world, keep making great fashion and continue to spread the word.
 
             
 
'relax baby be cool' strives to keep the local craftsmanship alive and supports the growth of new generation artists. Everything has a cost tho and as much as we would love to just give away all our creations we put great stress on fair trade and equal rights. 
We are looking for more great minds to support our project and share our views.
 
       
 
We want to keep the Batik collection alive by changing patterns and designs, but keeping the legends. Currently working on our new collection, with more fabulous memoirs and myths entwined in the materials we use. The additional couture as well as ready-to-wear future capsule collections will be combined with different exotic textiles and will consist of ageless, stand-out statement pieces that have a meaning and leave an impression. We are all about seeing and creating things a bit differently.
Future plans include generating more jobs in developing countries, highlighting the importance of fair trade, introducing more unacknowledged artists and maybe even opening our own concept store.
We dream big.
In exchange for the help, we would like to share with you our favorite pieces from our Batik collection for prices you can't find anywhere else and lifelong benefits that will live as long as 'relax baby be cool'.
For smaller contributions we have handmade jewellery and accessories all created by us and in collaboration with talented artists across the globe to have a meaningful gift for each and every one of our supporters
Chose your favorite perk and feel free to get in touch in case of any inquiries.

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hey! My name Is Olivier and I'm a 17 year old student. I've always dreamt on studying in the United States but as some of you may know, the tuition is very expensive and financial aid is rarely given to foreign students. I've decided that if I really wanted to achieve my goals, I would have to get out of my comfort zone and try to do things on my own!</p>
<p>After one month of thinking, researching, designing and e-mailing App designers, the project is finally on it's way to become a real thing! It only needs a last thing; funding!</p>

<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>After contacting several App design companies, I've found a trustworthy brazilian App Designer called Markezure (<a href=""https://markezure.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://markezure.com/</a>). We've agreed on a 15.000 R$ (4.050 US$) budget for the whole app design, If this project gets funded all the money will be used to pay the app designer and for marketing of the App. Regarding marketing, I have a relative that runs a e-marketing company (<a href=""https://www.gamned.com/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.gamned.com/</a>) and would help me promote the App if it ever got funded.</p>

<p>Everything starts in 2018 with a classic motorcycle and the idea of ​​customize it to create an actual design that could match functionally and aesthetically the bikes in the actual market. From the beginning this project was a challenge, each step and new process were incredibly exciting.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1531758763/illymtqbzmgylphgor9o.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>During those months this project became the lifestyle I was looking for, BELMONT RECLAIM and the N 63º19' motorcycle were born. Once the bike was completely finished I was very surprised to see the interest it raised, it definitely was an eye-catcher. But I wanted to go further, I had found a lifestyle I was passionate about and I wanted to share it with as many people as possible <strong>developing affordable products</strong> that could transmit the essence of the brand, this was an even bigger challenge.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544031952/twxvrt8nuv8vlwk7auif.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>I am passionate about fashion and accessories that allow us to express ourselves and externalize our personality. Coincidentally, while I was looking for accessories to capture BELMONT character, my watch, a basic model that accompanied me everywhere during 6 years, almost an extension of my body, fell to the ground and broke. It was going to be very difficult to replace it. I spent some time mourning it until I decided to look for a replacement and at that moment I saw there was <strong>a good market opportunity</strong>:</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544032044/qyd02xlem5bdo47dhvy9.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>That's when, together with Aaron Cuenca (CMO), we began to <strong>investigate the market</strong> in depth and the traditional watch companies and we discovered that <strong>the structural costs could be reduced in a significant way</strong>. It definitely was a good opportunity and I put myself to capture the essence of <strong>BELMONT</strong>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544032356/ftm2ryvvgqse82fdh73o.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>I started to experiment and <strong>evaluate design processes</strong>, <strong>production processes</strong>, <strong>different suppliers and manufacturers</strong> and, finally, I found something that could really reach my expectations and I chose the 4 watch designs that would compose the first BELMONT watches collection inspired on the N 63 º19' motorcycle based on four watch designs, and <strong>here is one them</strong>.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544032747/awgfhdygo0rvvwyumbyt.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>We developed <strong>several samples</strong> until we finally found <strong>the perfect balance</strong> between design, materials and mechanics and still maintain low product costs!!</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1544032852/ufsdmvzimpofyxmw4nc2.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Once we got 100% sure of the quality of the samples we ordered <strong>a small batch</strong> of our new watch designs to ran <strong>a small market test</strong> and it worked pretty well, we almost ran out of stock very quick.</p>

</div></div>","Everything starts in 2018 with a classic motorcycle and the idea of ​​customize it to create an actual design that could match functionally and aesthetically the bikes in the actual market. From the beginning this project was a challenge, each step and new process were incredibly exciting.

During those months this project became the lifestyle I was looking for, BELMONT RECLAIM and the N 63º19' motorcycle were born. Once the bike was completely finished I was very surprised to see the interest it raised, it definitely was an eye-catcher. But I wanted to go further, I had found a lifestyle I was passionate about and I wanted to share it with as many people as possible developing affordable products that could transmit the essence of the brand, this was an even bigger challenge.

I am passionate about fashion and accessories that allow us to express ourselves and externalize our personality. Coincidentally, while I was looking for accessories to capture BELMONT character, my watch, a basic model that accompanied me everywhere during 6 years, almost an extension of my body, fell to the ground and broke. It was going to be very difficult to replace it. I spent some time mourning it until I decided to look for a replacement and at that moment I saw there was a good market opportunity:

That's when, together with Aaron Cuenca (CMO), we began to investigate the market in depth and the traditional watch companies and we discovered that the structural costs could be reduced in a significant way. It definitely was a good opportunity and I put myself to capture the essence of BELMONT.


I started to experiment and evaluate design processes, production processes, different suppliers and manufacturers and, finally, I found something that could really reach my expectations and I chose the 4 watch designs that would compose the first BELMONT watches collection inspired on the N 63 º19' motorcycle based on four watch designs, and here is one them.

We developed several samples until we finally found the perfect balance between design, materials and mechanics and still maintain low product costs!!

Once we got 100% sure of the quality of the samples we ordered a small batch of our new watch designs to ran a small market test and it worked pretty well, we almost ran out of stock very quick.
Now it's time to offer you the BELMONT ASPHALT CHRONO at INDIEGOGO!

We are a small team of true adventurers that love surf, motorbikes and hiking. 


The first step we took before taking the pencil was to establish some basic objectives, the foundations on which we would structure the BELMONT collection.

The next step was to develop the design. 

Once we got the concept we started the 3D modeling.

Then we created the 2D drawings and we send them to our manufacturing partner to validate the engineering and develop the prototypes.

During the samples development we defined the technical specifications of the ASPHALT CHRONO.


Finally we could set a complete timeline defining all the steps until our backers product reception.


We have invested months of work to define and verify that the company structure is the adequate. We have also developed a very good relationship with the manufacturer of our watches, a very professional partner with experience in the industry. We have also spent months developing samples to be sure of what kind of problems can appear in the future and we have prepared a quality control plan to prevent them.
We are prepared to deal with the product shipping since we have the logistic side of the structure under control thanks to Shipius, our logistic partner has work many years hand to hand with Amazon. We have experience in the online sales because our CMO is a powerful reference in the online sales strategy sector.
We are committed to keep our backers informed all the time during production with periodic updates of the process with images of the finished parts of the product, assembly processes, etc.
If at any time there is a setback during this process and we can not comply with the schedule, we ensure to keep our backers informed.
Our goal is to create a brand that could last over the time and we will do whatever it takes to keep our promise and deliver watches that exceed your expectations.

That's why we craft biodegradable t-shirts and singlets that make you look and feel great. Made from bamboo, all of our fibers are sustainably grown on plantations owned and run by local communities in Bali and Portugal. And for each Nooboo piece you buy, we plant one tree in our sustainable Nooboo Bamboo Forest in Indonesia. Wake up with a fresh dip in your wardrobe and let the tailored fit enhance your natural beauty. Nooboo fashion essentials are designed for superior performance, combining modern day style and everyday good vibes.  Nooboo fashion essentials are good for you, the planet and the people we share it with. All you have to do to help is simply ordering a shirt. You cool. The earth cool. Everybody cool.Explore the world leaving no trace. Nooboo 100% bamboo basics are 100% biodegradable.Go natural, all the way. At least, we did—even with our dyes. The coloring takes up to two weeks and but hey! It looks and feels so good.Nooboo bamboo is not only bursting with natural goodness, it is extremely durable too. It simply lasts longer and always remains in style.For every Nooboo piece sold, we plant one tree in our sustainable Nooboo Bamboo Forest in Ubud, Indonesia.Bamboo grows up to one millimeter per minute and once it’s chopped down, it simply regrows. This is why bamboo plantations use only a little soil.Take a breath of fresh air. Bamboo generates more oxygen and removes more carbon dioxide from the air than trees.Thanks to bamboo’s sustainable nature, we are saving 3,500 liters of water per shirt. That’s the same as having 100 showers, without missing one.Who needs fertilizers? Nooboo bamboo gets all of its nutrients and energy from the soil.Nooboo bamboo is naturally resistant against pests. All it needs to grow is water and a daily dose of tender loving care.Wake up with a fresh dip in your wardrobe. Nooboo fashion essentials are designed to enhance your natural beauty.Keep your cool, naturally.  Whether you need to perform for work or play, Nooboo bamboo keeps you cool when it’s hot—and hot when it’s cool.Whatever the day brings, Nooboo bamboo draws moisture away from your skin into the fibers, keeping you dry and in style.Exercise in any position, at any temperature. No sweat. Nooboo bamboo absorbs three times more than any cotton does.Smell fresh, even when you’re not. Nooboo bamboo is naturally resistant against bacteria and therefore, leaves no odor.Let nature give you a much-needed hug. Nooboo bamboo’s soft texture feels like a second skin. Yes, we did your laundry. Once. But only because bamboo tends to shrink after the very first wash and we wanted you to enjoy a seamless first fit.Nooboo bamboo works naturally for all, bringing special benefits to those with sensitive skin and allergies.   Enjoy the sun safely.

<p>VIXA Superspeed is a specially designed mechanical watch that pays tribute to the legendary racer Ayrton Senna and commemorates the upcoming 27th anniversary of Senna's untimely passing.</p>
<p>We incorporated elements of real racing cars into the design of VIXA Superspeed, inspired especially by the race cars driven by Senna, from his 1971 PORSCHE 917K to his 1988 McLaren MP4/4. The Superspeed is a memorial and celebration of a life lived at full speed.</p>
<p>Senna is gone, but his legend lives on.</p>

We incorporated elements of real racing cars into the design of VIXA Superspeed, inspired especially by the race cars driven by Senna, from his 1971 PORSCHE 917K to his 1988 McLaren MP4/4. The Superspeed is a memorial and celebration of a life lived at full speed.
Senna is gone, but his legend lives on.
 

 
 

 
Inspired by real cars, VIXA Superspeed incorporates multiple race car elements. Its curves and angles are reminiscent of a race car’s sleek lines and its craftsmanship and intricate mechanical movement speaks to its luxury quality. It looks fast even while standing still and it lets you feel the spirit of racing and the thrill of speed every time you wear it.
 

  
 
With different straps and bezels, VIXA offers watch lovers the chance to customize their own VIXA Superspeed. You can personalize your watch to suit any mood and every occasion. One watch that changes with your personal style whenever you choose.
 

 

 
 
 

 
VIXA Superspeed watch is carefully crafted with high quality components. The case is made from 316L stainless steel and is water resistant to 10 meters and can endure extreme temperatures and high-intensity pressure.
 

 

 
 Sapphire glass 
Sapphire glass is known for its clarity and hardness. It is one of the hardest substances on earth other than diamond. This means it is virtually scratchproof and perfectly clear, which is why we chose it to be VIXA's crystal.  
 

 
High-tech Strap
VIXA Superspeed straps are made of a high-tech material - fluorine rubber in the bottom layer and cowhide at the surface layer. This enables wrist comfort, flexibility and extreme durability at the same time. 
 

 
All straps are equipped with a quick-change system, such that you can easily change the strap in seconds. 

 

 
316L Stainless Steel
316L Stainless Steel is a high grade anti corrosion material and it is also the industry standard for top quality luxury watches.
 

 

 Delicate Caliber Design 
Equipped with a Miyota mechanical movement with automatic winding, VIXA Superspeed is a robust, reliable, and precision time keeper.

In college I was given the opportunity to go out and design and create many engineering and art projects. Armed with the universities CNC Mill and 3-D Printer, I was able to build numerous robots, create many 3-D printed models and even a few functional projects such as the box for one of my other passions, card games, as featured in my pitch photo.

I started by developing a business plan what will allow me to slowly begin using my skills to give back to the STEM community. This plan consists of three major parts:</p>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li>Develop a product that is in demand: lets face it 3-D printed stuff is cool, but what is even cooler is being able to have it customized and created before your eyes. Currently I am working on designs for several niche markets including: jewelry, gaming accessories, reproduction of archaeological findings from digital scans, and custom designed and manufactured robotics parts. In each of these fields I have been exploring options and needs of consumers and have determined that they each have potential. Additionally I have the support of a local artist, because lets face it, even the best engineers need a little help.</li>
<li>Sell My product: I have been working with small local businesses to build relationships and trust that will lead to distribution of my products to a wider market. This includes a craft jewelry shop and a local game shop that would love to sell a range of customized and standard design products. In addition to regular retail orders, I would offer my services as a free lance artist and designer to do work on commissions. This would allow me to make one of a kind art you can hold.</li>
<li>Give back: I have gained so much through my universities extracurricular activities and I feel that it is my responsibility to give back to the STEM community that has provided me with so much. The majority of the profits gained through this endeavor would then be donated to local STEM organizations that are educating our next generation of engineers and scientist. </li>

Having worked on it nearly two years they are just about ready and we are more excited than ever !   Beautiful & unique sacred geometric Naamika designs which support our awareness and consciousness in the beautiful form of divine jewelry in sterling silver 925 and 14k gold.

All are unisex, made of the finest natural materials and love! **in the picture first collection: Empress ring ( giving and receiving ) Source- finding the source of characteristic that serves no longer**  My name is Naama and I am the designer and founder of Naamika spirit to matterFive years ago I started practicing Geomancy, a way to feel & co-create with the earth consciousness . This means I can feel and heal energy lay lines within the earth , water, trees, people and more. With this technique I started receiving beautiful visions of sacred geometric symbols and signs in my mind, after a year or so I would see that these symbols already exist in the Kabala, Buddhism, Crop circles and so on ..this was super exciting realizing its a  UNITED CONSCIOUSNESS!! I researched each symbol on emotional and mathematical level as well as physical. I understood and experienced the meaning of each symbol. They all support a different precise personal growth process in a most magnificent away. These are Energy Enhancing Tools for Personal Growth !Our First Jewelry collection 'OF THE EARTH' was made three years ago in a SUSCSSFULL ISRAELI CROWD FUNDING PROJECT and it has been amazing hearing and seeing the waves of effect in peoples life's. We were offered to sell them on Israelis national airline El-AL, covered in the Israeli Magazine 'WOMAN', and have over thousands of clients worldwide ! **in the picture first collection Flower of the Heart 2D & 3D - to open heart chakra / enhancing love frequency**  HOW NAAMIKA'S SYMBOLS WORK Energy = ElectricitySacred Geometry:  A precise mathematical equation when used correctly can create dimension of harmonious healing shapes and figures. Universal patterns of sacred geometry design everything in our reality. This mathematical proportion is also referred to as Phi, Golden ratio ,Fibonacci or God's equation since it is found in all of nature: the spiral of the shell, flower, wave as well as in our human face and bodily proportions. Since ancient times it has been used to build temples, pyramids , great architecture and art. This equation brings harmony to our mind, body and soul creating a strong energy effect within our system.   
 
 Sterling silver and 14k gold are the best electric conductors and energy is electricity, with the combined shape of vision designed in perfect proportions and shapes they create maximum divine healing. The process is very natural in a soft and loving way, letting the energy of the symbol travel in your system to empower you to your inner self.  When wearing Naamika's healing symbols you receive support in connection to self. Hearing and feeling your heart and mind clearer and better. This allows you to create meaning full changes in your life from within. We all go through the same human processes in different and various ways. We believe that when we love and understand our self better we can love and have greater compassion for the rest. These  EMPOWRING TOOLS  work by strengthening our energetic field in a precise way in a precise journey that is offered by the specific NAAMIKA sacred geometric form.

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">Seglinge Brand</h3>
<p>Seglinge is a new watch brand coming from Finland, Europe. Seglinge wants to offer high quality and well designed watches with competetive prices. Our first watch model, Seglinge Benjamin chronograph, is designed really carefully without no compromises, because we wanted the watch to look great and wear perfectly. And we think that we did it, since our 40mm chronograph feels and looks really good on the wrist.</p>
<p>We work directly with a big watch manufacturer and we offer watches directly to the consumers, so you don't pay extra to the middleman. We use high quality Seiko watch movements and high quality watch parts, since we want to give value for the money to the consumers.</p>
<p>Our vision is to build a long lasting brand and expand the watch collection in the future. We use Indiegogo as a launch platform, since we want to launch the brand directly to the end consumers and therefore we can make these great launch offers too.<br/><br/>Seglinge name comes from small island, which is located in Åland archipelago between Finland mainland and Åland main island. Seglinge is a place where you can relax, enjoy the nice scandinavian summer and refreshing sea climate. There you can forget the busy city life for a moment and it's also a place, where you can create great designs, since you get really good spirit there. Seglinge - it's like a bliss.</p>

</div></div>","HOW IT STARTEDJeremy is a videographer based in Singapore and has shot several watch
adverts, approached by Jay, a long time friend who is in the luxury watch industry and both share great passion for watches. With the same believe that luxury watches currently in the market could be made more affordable, Norns Watches is created and decides to launch its first series Norns Avigate, an affordable luxury watch through Indiegogo.

BRAND NAME


Norns
is a Norse mythological being who controls
the destiny of gods and men. And that the 3 most prominent of Norns are Urðr
(fate), Verðandi (present) and Skuld (future).
                                          
The
name Norns was chosen for it symbolizes control and destiny and also the
entities, Urðr (fate), Verðandi (present) and Skuld (future). It represents, what we at Norns
Watches want to produce - a reliable watch, within your control for the present
and future.AFFORDABLE LUXURY


A
luxurious, high quality mechanical automatic watch at an affordable price is no longer beyond
reach, with your help, it is going to become a reality. 
The
watch is made of premium grade material and parts comparable to Swiss watches, packaged with a great
looking design. It truly embodies what we are set to deliver to you.
Norns
first watch series; Avigate is made and designed to suit both female and male
for every occasion.MENTIONED BY

WHAT IS AN AUTOMATIC WATCH?Norns Avigate is an automatic watch, requiring no batteries. The watch is powered by the motion of the wrist and no manual winding is needed. The energy is stored and created by the rotor,  a metal disc plate that spins with motion. This can only be achieved with precise engineering, workmanship and design.MOVEMENTThe movement chosen to power the watch is a Miyota Automatic 8215 Japanese Movement. It is a workhorse that will last for decades and known to be comparable to Swiss ETA movement, but at a much affordable price. We’ve also positioned the circular date window to the 6 o’clock position, improving the aesthetics and design.PROCESS

In
order to find the perfect material
for our watch, we did a thorough research on different materials used by big watch
brands. We then made and went through many rounds of revisions before coming out with a design we are truly satisfied with, striking a perfect
balance between quality and affordability.We also managed to find a reputable watch manufacturer that is able to produce our desired watches in good quantity with quality assurance.

<p><strong>FABRIC</strong><br/>If you have tried and believe that the Modal fabric is comfortable, you are up for a treat!

Luckily after months of research and many failed prototypes, 7 different prototypes to be exact... we found the perfect design and fabric! 

We are excited to introduce the fabric MicroModal. This fabric is incredibly smooth, breathable and cool to the touch. This in a combination with the revolutionary U-Shape design on the front. The function of this design is to hold your package in place during your active day as well as cozy weekends. 

Both of these in a combination with our signature waistband that is by far the softest on the market has led us to one of the best and most comfortable underwear designs that you will ever wear. Drum roll, please... The Answer! 


You will find everything from fabric to design details under this headline. A quick overview is presented on the picture below. 

 
FABRICIf you have tried and believe that the Modal fabric is comfortable, you are up for a treat! These bad boys are made from MicroModal, a skin friendly natural fiber made from sourced beech-wood. It is 3x softer than cotton unlike its older sibling Modal which is only twice as soft.* 

*The softness is measured according to the Kawabata method. Kyoto University, Japan. Cotton/Lenzing Modal 50/50 %.
 
GSMWith 180 GSM (180g/m2) you have one of the highest quality fabrics for underwear on the market, and while it’s thick and soft don’t forget that it is incredibly breathable and cool to the touch, which makes it the perfect choice of fabric for intimate wear.

 
TRIPLE STITCHBeside your crazy late nights and stressful mornings the triple stitch attachment will be there to support you even when you’re a bit clumsy. 
 WAISTBANDThe waistband fabric, something most companies don’t talk about is something that we value extremely high, simply because you should be informed about everything when it comes to something so intimate. We use a blend of polyamide, polyester & elastane which is incredibly soft, durable yet flexible. You will not feel it, only see it. TAGLESSOur underwear is tagless, but worry not! All the information you need is printed directly on the fabric in high quality.THE BEST PARTYou will look at your best in every situation!""Nothing is sexier than a confident man with a smile!"" - Every Youtube video about this topic. As standard, you will have the red to choose, with our signature red waistband. However, if we reach our stretch goal of Stretch of $10000 we will add an second color and if we reach the stretch goal of  $15000 we will be able to add third colors, Further updates, and a poll will be posted once we reach our regular goal.  We are currently offering The answer in Black & Black and Blue & black without reaching our stretch goal.

The signet ring is a modern classic that can be styled for weddings, engagements or other milestone moments such as professional and academic achievements like graduations and promotions. It's the ideal piece for a family crest, monogram or to capture and commemorate a loved ones profile, a meaningful emblem or corporate logo. OUR PRODUCTWe work solely with aircraft grade titanium (Ti 6Al-4V, Grade 5 alloy) because of its strength, durability and beauty - but also as an attractive and affordable alternative to white gold and platinum. Titanium offers endless design possibilities that will never tarnish.Titanium is our core competence and medium. It inspires us every day. All of our titanium rings are made to order at our workshop in Montreal, Quebec (Canada). We believe in our material and craftsmanship - we will never import bulk product to offload cheaply. Our experience tells a story and we want your moment to be part of it. Our rings are made to last. OUR PEOPLEDavid, a Master Craftsman, has been designing and milling titanium rings for over 18 years. With a pioneering spirit, he helped build and manage the most prominent and successful titanium ring company currently in operation.Now teaming up with his brother to build EdwardBrothersTitaniumRings.com, an online store that will revolutionize the way titanium rings are designed and marketed, the Edward Brothers are intent on building an interactive consumer site that will ultimately give guests the freedom to choose and design their own rings. OUR GOALThe aim of this Indiegogo campaign is to help the Edward Brothers raise much needed funds to complete the customization features of their consumer web site and to cover shop costs. These funds will be used to complete their vision and maintain their fully functional workshop.  Edward Brothers are open for business and need your help to remain operational - in an environment where they can ply their trade without prejudice, on an ethical platform, honorably, equitably and with a humbling respect for this craft. We operate with the belief that everyone should be able to access popularly priced, fine titanium jewelry.  Once used by the world's leaders, monumental men and in important houses, the signet ring played an important role in business and daily life as a seal to authenticate official documents. Signet rings bore a distinctive marking such as a coat of arms, monogram or crest, easily identifying it to a particular family, club or organization.From ancient times to today, signet rings offer a singular style and flair that Edward Brothers would like to popularize once again. Please support us on our journey, join our community and reward yourself by sharing our legacy with a one-of-a-kind signet ring where you too can start a family tradition. OUR PERKSWe will take virtually any image and translate it to our freshly designed signet ring, exclusively on Indiegogo. 1. Monogrammed Signet RingTo thank you for backing us, we'll custom mill a monogrammed signet ring bearing three (3) alphabetic characters.  We offer a choice of two font styles for your personal monogram. 2.

Not only does this mean pledging for one of our awesome watches, but sharing the story with a friend. We are going to do everything we can to spread the word in a variety of ways.  We hope through the use of social media and blogs we can drive enough outside traffic to our page which will result in us reaching our funding goal.  If you could do something as simple as tweeting about our page, or just sharing this page to your Facebook page, it can really go a long way. Simply click the Facebook and Twitter tabs at the top of the page.If funded, how will you fulfil the orders?We've tweaked the initial prototype, finalised our design, purchased the models and selected a manufacturer that has a great reputation in the industry.  Once Indiegogo releases the funds, we can pay the initial deposit to begin production.  Production time takes roughly 30 days depending on the quantity of the order.  Our team will then ship the orders to our awesome backers! We have experience with shipping software and thermal printers which should make for a very smooth process. Risks and challengesThe challenges for Winner Watches will be getting the word out, and convincing people to participate. With so many great projects to choose from, we hope ours will stand apart from the rest. To reach as many people as possible, we are asking friends, families, and various blogs to help spread the word.Once the funding is in place, the challenge will be producing on a large scale. Depending on outside help is difficult, but we have been dealing with a manufacturer for months and have established a solid relationship, which has has given us a lot of confidence in them. Now we're here, on IndieGogo, with a fully functional prototype that looks amazing. We just need one more thing... your support!",6.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p>So, apart from the renowned workhorse movement being the Seiko NH 35A and classic <strong>British </strong>vintage design, we have used the material form an original DC-3 aeroplane to make the metal tags which you see on the dial.  </p>
<p>So for watch enthusiasts &amp; aviation lovers we are giving people the opportunity to wear a piece of history. Each watch will be made with a metal tag in the 6 hour position made from the wing of a 1940s DC-3, with the plane identification number <strong>NC - 16007</strong> engraved onto the tag itself !</p>
<p>So, we really need your support to bring this project to life !</p>

<p> One of the longest-used airliners ever, the Douglas DC-3 nears 80 years in the air as an aviation icon.</p>
<p>​The Douglas DC-3 is universally recognised as the greatest airplane of its time, some would argue that it is the greatest of all time……..</p>
<p>The Douglas Aircraft Company built the ""Douglas Commercial 3"" and was based on the 1933/34 Douglas DC-1 and DC-2.  Design work began in 1934 and he DC-3 debuted in the mid-1930's as an aviation rock star.</p>
<p>THE FIRST FLIGHT December 17, 1935, was a sunny but cool afternoon in Santa Monica, California. The holidays were coming and spirits were high in the Douglas Aircraft Company. It was another ordinary day at Clover Field, a big polished propeller caught the sun’s light as it began to turn.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1595857636/onriqmthdjssu0vb673f.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Slowly it revolved and then a belch of blue-white smoke appeared. The engine roared into life, and the propeller was lost in its own motion. A second propeller came to life. For a few minutes, the engines roared and then the plane began to move forward.</p>
<p>With its two powerful propeller engines it revolutionised the travel industry by cutting typical coast-to-coast flight time across the United States from 25 hours to just 18.</p>
<p>​Pilots, both military and civilian, loved the DC-3. It took off easily, cruised comfortably at 185 mph at 10,000 feet, and had a ceiling of 23,200 feet and a low stalling speed (67 mph). Pilots said it landed itself, and it had a cruising range of 1,500–2,100 miles.</p>
<p>When production of the DC-3 ended in 1945, more than 13,000 of them had been built. The DC-3’s ease of handling and maintenance, its facility at taking off and landing on short runways, and its remarkable reliability combined to keep it flying in many regions of the world into the 21st century.</p>

<p>Watch designer Terrence Ray has been designing timepieces for a number of years and has worked in joint collaborations and designs with a number of watchmakers. Terrence was the designer for the Aston Martin tourbillon, designed as timepiece to celebrate the release of the new Aston Martin Valkyrie super car and presented to the design director of Aston Martin himself at their headquarters in Gaydon, Warwickshire.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1595860666/g6cij5kszqhlanb21i5a.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Passionate about watches, Terrence Ray from a very early age had a keen interest in timepieces and at the age of just ten travelled half way across London on his own, taking 2 bus rides in order to purchase his first timepiece, and form that moment on Terrence became a bit of a collector of unique timepieces. So it goes without saying that Terrence later on in life became interested in Horology and subsequently gravitated towards designing watches himself.</p>
<p>Terrence Ray has now launched the new vintage STROND brand, with the release of the eagerly anticipated DC-3 Series.</p>

</div></div>","The new STROND brand is inspired by the classic beauty of 1930's aviation, and allows the owner to fall in love with a wonderful era of design. LIMITED EDITION 


We got our inspiration from the classic instrument panels of the WORLD FAMOUS Douglas DC-3 aeroplane made famous over over the last 80 years, and in films such as ""Raiders of the lost Arc"" and flown by James Bond in the film ""Quantum of Solace"" !
So, apart from the renowned workhorse movement being the Seiko NH 35A and classic British vintage design, we have used the material form an original DC-3 aeroplane to make the metal tags which you see on the dial.  
So for watch enthusiasts & aviation lovers we are giving people the opportunity to wear a piece of history. Each watch will be made with a metal tag in the 6 hour position made from the wing of a 1940s DC-3, with the plane identification number NC - 16007 engraved onto the tag itself !
So, we really need your support to bring this project to life !


 
CLASSIC VINTAGE STYLING  ! 
 

 
WEAR THE HISTORY ! 
 


The very tag on your new DC-3 timepiece is made from the very wing of a 1940s DC-3 taken from the top part of the plane wing !

We feel that it is nice to be wearing a piece of history and hope you can support us in bring this project to life, as there will be more classic designs and even more utilising of classic 1930's - 1940's vintage aircraft in our timepieces ! 
Classic styling, with a generous 42mm case, automatic 24 JEWEL movement, all stainless steel , sapphire glass and comes with a vintage Italian leather strap & a vintage canvas strap !

The thought, detail and passion that went into the design of the DC-3 is what makes this watch stand out.
Firstly the concept drawings  for the new STROND range were created.

 
 
 
 
 
CAD images (computer designed images) were created and used as a reference for the prototypes.

And of course, the original 1930's airplane skin used to make the dial tag makes this watch stand out !

 


 
Anti glare reflection.... 
The sapphire glass front also benefits from a AR (anti reflection) coating, which is a really useful feature, and together with the super luminous hands makes for great look.

 One of the longest-used airliners ever, the Douglas DC-3 nears 80 years in the air as an aviation icon.
​The Douglas DC-3 is universally recognised as the greatest airplane of its time, some would argue that it is the greatest of all time……..
The Douglas Aircraft Company built the ""Douglas Commercial 3"" and was based on the 1933/34 Douglas DC-1 and DC-2.  Design work began in 1934 and he DC-3 debuted in the mid-1930's as an aviation rock star.
THE FIRST FLIGHT December 17, 1935, was a sunny but cool afternoon in Santa Monica, California. The holidays were coming and spirits were high in the Douglas Aircraft Company. It was another ordinary day at Clover Field, a big polished propeller caught the sun’s light as it began to turn.

 
Slowly it revolved and then a belch of blue-white smoke appeared. The engine roared into life, and the propeller was lost in its own motion. A second propeller came to life. For a few minutes, the engines roared and then the plane began to move forward.
With its two powerful propeller engines it revolutionised the travel industry by cutting typical coast-to-coast flight time across the United States from 25 hours to just 18.
​Pilots, both military and civilian, loved the DC-3. It took off easily, cruised comfortably at 185 mph at 10,000 feet, and had a ceiling of 23,200 feet and a low stalling speed (67 mph). Pilots said it landed itself, and it had a cruising range of 1,500–2,100 miles.
When production of the DC-3 ended in 1945, more than 13,000 of them had been built. The DC-3’s ease of handling and maintenance, its facility at taking off and landing on short runways, and its remarkable reliability combined to keep it flying in many regions of the world into the 21st century.
 

 
James Bond 007 flies the Gooney Bird 2008, a Gooney Bird helped James Bond get out of a jam........Fans of the Bond film ""Quantum of Solace,"" may recall actor Daniel Craig in the cockpit of a beat-up DC-3 fighting off a Marchetti plane......see the video clip below.

Indiana Jones flies the DC-3
Back in the 1980s, a DC-3 served another movie franchise hero. In ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,"" Indy flies from New York to Newfoundland to the Azores and Europe on his quest for the Holy Grail.

Watch designer Terrence Ray has been designing timepieces for a number of years and has worked in joint collaborations and designs with a number of watchmakers. Terrence was the designer for the Aston Martin tourbillon, designed as timepiece to celebrate the release of the new Aston Martin Valkyrie super car and presented to the design director of Aston Martin himself at their headquarters in Gaydon, Warwickshire.

Passionate about watches, Terrence Ray from a very early age had a keen interest in timepieces and at the age of just ten travelled half way across London on his own, taking 2 bus rides in order to purchase his first timepiece, and form that moment on Terrence became a bit of a collector of unique timepieces. So it goes without saying that Terrence later on in life became interested in Horology and subsequently gravitated towards designing watches himself.
Terrence Ray has now launched the new vintage STROND brand, with the release of the eagerly anticipated DC-3 Series.

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I am Isabella Zanconato, 35 years old, a normal person that works in a Banks and that, during the isolation two months period due to COVID 19, I started thinking to create something that could embrace the sustainability and diversity matters. We are living in the same Planet that we have to respect and I think that doing sport with sustainable and really comfortable clothes will be have a plus value. Since May 2020 I started approaching PADEL (is a racket sport similar to tennis) and due to the lack of nice and comfortable and sustainable sport clothes I decided to build up and develop an eco-sustainable sports brand, 100% made in Italy (design and manufacturing). The additional plus value are the fabrics because they are made with ECONYL sewing thread, regenerated from pre and post consumer waste materials such as fishing nets, carpet fluff, rigid tulle, etc; materials that reached the end of their life cycle and which, instead of being disposed in a landfill, are recovered and regenerated through a complex physico-chemical breakdown process. At the launch of the project I would like to focus mainly on Women who want to play sports with the feeling of having a second skin without the annoying sensation of tight clothes. With the project I will create suitable outfit for all types of bodies because everyone has the right to play sports and feeling comfortable and confident.

This is why we tried to minimise the size of the Crewband and keep it light. You will be agile and free, but always safe - this is our premise.We also wanted to create a device that can be worn 24/7, without first having to attach it to your safety vest or jacket. The energy efficiency we achieved allows for up to 2 days of complete darkness, after which you might want to charge your Crewbands using any light source available to you - even a lamp will suffice.Want to try the system first?Our apps are free of charge, so you can download and try them out any time. If you want to test the system first, simply connect to your fitness tracker or smartwatch. That's right, you can also use them as safety wristband. Of course, the connection stability and range will depend on the hardware you use, and we cannot speak for how good it will be.There is a solution for this as well, your very own Crewband.The start of Team Crewbands.After thorough testing in rivers, lakes and the sea, we decided to talk to professional sailors and fellow developers. Their feedback encouraged us to proceed and make this product real.During the Vienna Race of the Austrian Sailboat Racing Series, we showed the prototype to sailing professionals and enthusiasts. They did not only like our product, but also our presentation - especially the part where they got to throw one of us in the water constantly.As we are ocean enthusiasts, we had to tip our hat to one of the great oceanographers. We mean this quite literally, which is why we wear red beanies - which you can purchase as well, check out our rewards.You made our day and helped fund the project!Help us to grow even bigger and get your Crewband with the special Kickstarter discount!                                       Prototypes Timeline Risks and challengesWe have been working on Crewbands for over a year and developed the key parts such as the electronic, watertight wristband and Android (available) and iOS app (awaiting approval any day now). The founding team are experts in their field and know the necessary steps to bring Crewbands to the market.To gain more real life experience with the quality and reliability of a Crewband, the next step is to conduct a big test round with sailing experts over several month in different conditions. This may lead to insights that make changes to the current version necessary.However, we know that life is not always fully predictable and there might be unforeseen troubles waiting for us on the road to mass production. We have a great network of industry partners and other startups that have manufactured products before. We will further leverage this network to ensure we can bring our Crewbands to life and into your hands.The main challenges we see are:Bluetooth Range: To prevent false alarms, a good bluetooth connection reliability is key. We will put a lot of effort into optimising the connection range in specialised laboratories to ensure a good user experience.Watertightness: Packing so much technology in so little space at this price point challenges our goal to make each Crewband safe to dive with up to 10m.

<h3><u>OUR HISTORY AND STORY</u></h3>
<p>Kwame Baah Brand's founder, George Kwame Baah, grew up in Ghana under impoverished conditions. He was blessed to make it to the USA as an adult, where he attended university and got a job as an engineer. Whenever he visited his family in Ghana, his desire grew to find a sustainable avenue to help raise them out of poverty. Recollecting his childhood experience of making his own shoes from recycled tires, he was inspired to begin a shoe company. His vision was to design shoes and employ men and women in Ghana to handcraft them for the US market. Thus, in 2011, Kwame Baah Brand was founded with the mission to provide sustainable, economically just employment for skilled artisans in Ghana. We blend contemporary designs with traditional fabrics from Ghana, producing quality handcrafted footwear and accessories that are comfortable, stylish, durable, and affordable. We source all our leather from US suppliers and Italy. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1570152669/pr8lktf8kumgxnp4rf8g.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Kwame Baah trains artisans from George's hometown, Akim-Oda, and nearby regions to make sandals and accessories following George's own designs. Currently we have eleven artisans that handcraft our designs at our workshop in Ghana. The living wage that this job provides for our employees has enabled them to improve their lives in significant ways. Many have been able to provide their children with quality education, and some have rebuilt marriage relationships that had been eroding due to financial hardship. </p>
<p>We need to produce closed-toe footwear to allow continuous operation throughout the year. Your support in helping us to obtain the remaining mold and last will help continue this life-improving ministry. We are grateful to all those who will contribute to this campaign, enabling us to keep lifting people out of poverty in Ghana.  </p>

<u><strong>About our fabric- </strong></u>Kente waving process:</h3>
<p>Kente is an Akan word meaning basket, but the Akan also refer to the material as “nwentoma,” meaning woven cloth. Kente is made by weaving cotton thread in a loom. The material is itself a remarkable product of art and engineering as well as a significant part of Ghana’s history and culture. Kente is very expensive cloth and for many centuries it was mainly worn by royalty. The cost is mainly due to the intricate process of weaving, which takes much time and human energy. A strip of Kente cloth (similar to the width and length of a graduation stole sash) could take an entire day’s work by the most skilled craftsman! The way Kente cloth is woven and the types of patterns that are created are both wonders to behold. </p>

<h3> </h3>
<p>Often, stories, ideas, or proverbs are expressed through the Kente cloth.Every color has meaning, so the way they are used in various patterns, sometimes in combination with the Adinkra symbols, work together to express a specific idea, often with multiple layers of meaning. Below are some of the meanings associated with many of the common colors in Kente cloth;</p>
<p>black: maturation, intensified spiritual energy</p>
<p>blue: peacefulness, harmony and love</p>
<p>green: vegetation, planting, harvesting, growth, spiritual renewal</p>
<p>gold: royalty, wealth, high status, glory, spiritual purity</p>
<p>grey: healing and cleansing rituals; associated with ash</p>

<p><i>Rubber inner tubes</i>. As kids, we <i>loved</i> them. We spent <i>hours</i> playing with them. But where are they now? They’ve all but disappeared, and no one has looked to improve upon them. Today’s cheap, plastic vinyl tubes lack durability, are hard to inflate, and seldom last more than a few hours before they burst. Most are very toxic, are a huge waste of money, and continue to pile up in our landfills.</p>
<p><img alt=""One of the Übertüb kids enjoying a stack of tubes"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1353653/files/20150403190431-3tubes-kid.jpg?1428113071"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
And so, entrepreneurs <i>Scott McCrindle</i> and <i>Steve Miller</i> bring you the <strong>Übertüb</strong> (pronounced Ubertube). It’s the classic rubber inner tube - <i>reinvented</i>, <i>re-engineered</i>, and <i>re-designed</i> for you and your family. Our <i>patent-pending</i>, recessed valve system makes <i>rapid inflation</i> and <i>deflation</i> a snap. Take it <i>anywhere</i> and pack it up with <i>ease</i> in the quick-dry mesh storage sack! It’s extremely <i>durable</i>, so you’ll never have to worry about it bursting or the seams coming apart.

<p>And for the first time ever, you can have a rubber <strong>Übertüb</strong> in <i>color</i>! We’ve worked with leading engineers to develop a durable <i>colored rubber</i>. This brings a whole new level of awesomeness and fun to the <strong>Übertüb</strong>! Re-discover this simple, awesome, and <i>timeless</i> toy with your friends and family!</p>
<h2>And For a Short Time, Get An Übertüb At Wholesale Pricing!</h2>
<p>By <i>contributing</i> your support, you can be one of the <i>very first</i> to get an <strong>Übertüb</strong>. This is a <strong>limited-time opportunity</strong> to <i>own</i> this, award-winning, innovative, and ground-breaking product at a <i>huge discount </i>over retail pricing. We are making the medium size available first, and the other two sizes will be available as stretch goals once we've met our initial target - more on this later.</p>
<p>Proceeds from the campaign will help us complete the final work required to get these tubes off the assembly line–injection moulds and tooling, materials research and development, quality and safety testing, legal and regulatory compliance work, and retail/e-commerce packaging design.</p>
<h2>What Makes the Übertüb Different From The Plastic Vinyl Inflatables?</h2>
<p>We‘ve re-thought the classic rubber inner tube we all know and love in a multitude of different ways. Finally, an end to low-quality inflatable outdoor products that leave us all feeling deflated.</p>
<h3>Easy to Inflate and Deflate</h3>
<p><img alt=""Watch how our patent-pending valve system makes the Übertüb exceedingly simple to use"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1336338/files/20150329112634-benefits-valve-stack.gif?1427653594"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>We’ve designed a valve system that allows you to use just about whatever you have on hand to inflate your tube. A gas station air pump, your portable air compressor, a foot/hand pump, or even our easy-to-use manual inflation tool will quickly do the trick. A check valve keeps all the air inside your <strong>Übertüb</strong> while you screw on the convenient cap that locks all the parts in place.</p>
<p>
</p><div class=""campaignStoryVideoWrapper""><iframe class=""embedly-embed"" height=""326"" src=""https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F5medTjLGr7I%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D5medTjLGr7I%26feature%3Dyoutu.be&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F5medTjLGr7I%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=64da7ba9305b45b68029ce9f0c7e4d75&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube"" width=""580""></iframe></div>
<p></p>
<p>You will never again have to struggle to <i>deflate</i> your tube. Just unscrew the valve assembly and all the air rushes out, allowing you to quickly roll up your <strong>Übertüb</strong>, or fold it <i>flat</i>. A 42” tube deflates in mere <i>seconds</i> so you’ll be off and ready to go. Your old inner tube sure didn’t do <i>that</i>!</p>
<h3>Durable and Dependable</h3>

<p>Constructed using <i>industrial-strength</i> butyl rubber, your <strong>Übertüb</strong> is ready for just about <i>any</i> punishment that you or your kids can dish out. We’ve tried all kinds of ways to destroy it and the <strong>Übertüb</strong> just keeps coming back for more abuse. Every part of the product is designed and crafted with quality in mind. These are <i>built to last</i>–just like the old days.</p>
<h3>Multiple Color Choices</h3>
<p><img alt=""All three sizes of the Übertüb"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1353662/files/20150403191608-3-tubes-in-stands.jpg?1428113768"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>The old carbon-black tubes were pretty darn good, but they looked a bit <i>drab</i>. Not anymore! The <strong>Übertüb</strong> is available in <i>several colors</i> of rubber. We’ve worked with leading rubber compounding companies to produce a UV-stable, durable, and safe recreation-specific colored material. Now you can have it <i>both</i> ways–real <i>rubber</i> and your favorite color, too.</p>
<h3>Convenient Storage and Portability</h3>
<p><img alt=""The Übertüb folds up and packs away flat"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1336359/files/20150329114250-3deflated-tubes-mesh-bag.jpg?1427654570"" src="""" style=""""/></p>
<p>With no trapped air inside, your <strong>Übertüb</strong> slides easily into the <i>included</i> quick-dry mesh bag and it’s ready for next time. Its small packed size makes it a breeze to toss into a suitcase, load in a trunk, or stow it wherever you want. Storing and transporting your <strong>Übertüb</strong> just became a whole lot more <i>convenient</i>.</p>
<h3>Safer, More Comfortable Valve</h3>
<p><img alt=""The Übertüb flush valve looks awesome and won’t ever jab you"" class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://images.indiegogo.com/file_attachments/1336364/files/20150329114641-blue-tube-plain-680x420.jpg?1427654801"" src="""" style=""""/></p>

Rubber inner tubes. As kids, we loved them. We spent hours playing with them. But where are they now? They’ve all but disappeared, and no one has looked to improve upon them. Today’s cheap, plastic vinyl tubes lack durability, are hard to inflate, and seldom last more than a few hours before they burst. Most are very toxic, are a huge waste of money, and continue to pile up in our landfills.

And so, entrepreneurs Scott McCrindle and Steve Miller bring you the Übertüb (pronounced Ubertube). It’s the classic rubber inner tube - reinvented, re-engineered, and re-designed for you and your family. Our patent-pending, recessed valve system makes rapid inflation and deflation a snap. Take it anywhere and pack it up with ease in the quick-dry mesh storage sack! It’s extremely durable, so you’ll never have to worry about it bursting or the seams coming apart.

And for the first time ever, you can have a rubber Übertüb in color! We’ve worked with leading engineers to develop a durable colored rubber. This brings a whole new level of awesomeness and fun to the Übertüb! Re-discover this simple, awesome, and timeless toy with your friends and family!
And For a Short Time, Get An Übertüb At Wholesale Pricing!
By contributing your support, you can be one of the very first to get an Übertüb. This is a limited-time opportunity to own this, award-winning, innovative, and ground-breaking product at a huge discount over retail pricing. We are making the medium size available first, and the other two sizes will be available as stretch goals once we've met our initial target - more on this later.
Proceeds from the campaign will help us complete the final work required to get these tubes off the assembly line–injection moulds and tooling, materials research and development, quality and safety testing, legal and regulatory compliance work, and retail/e-commerce packaging design.
What Makes the Übertüb Different From The Plastic Vinyl Inflatables?
We‘ve re-thought the classic rubber inner tube we all know and love in a multitude of different ways. Finally, an end to low-quality inflatable outdoor products that leave us all feeling deflated.
Easy to Inflate and Deflate

We’ve designed a valve system that allows you to use just about whatever you have on hand to inflate your tube. A gas station air pump, your portable air compressor, a foot/hand pump, or even our easy-to-use manual inflation tool will quickly do the trick. A check valve keeps all the air inside your Übertüb while you screw on the convenient cap that locks all the parts in place.



You will never again have to struggle to deflate your tube. Just unscrew the valve assembly and all the air rushes out, allowing you to quickly roll up your Übertüb, or fold it flat. A 42” tube deflates in mere seconds so you’ll be off and ready to go. Your old inner tube sure didn’t do that!
Durable and Dependable



Constructed using industrial-strength butyl rubber, your Übertüb is ready for just about any punishment that you or your kids can dish out. We’ve tried all kinds of ways to destroy it and the Übertüb just keeps coming back for more abuse. Every part of the product is designed and crafted with quality in mind. These are built to last–just like the old days.
Multiple Color Choices

The old carbon-black tubes were pretty darn good, but they looked a bit drab. Not anymore! The Übertüb is available in several colors of rubber. We’ve worked with leading rubber compounding companies to produce a UV-stable, durable, and safe recreation-specific colored material. Now you can have it both ways–real rubber and your favorite color, too.
Convenient Storage and Portability

With no trapped air inside, your Übertüb slides easily into the included quick-dry mesh bag and it’s ready for next time. Its small packed size makes it a breeze to toss into a suitcase, load in a trunk, or stow it wherever you want. Storing and transporting your Übertüb just became a whole lot more convenient.
Safer, More Comfortable Valve

At long last – a tube with a valve that doesn’t jab you while you’re swimming or sliding down a snow-covered hill. The entire valve assembly is flush and contoured with the inside surface of the Übertüb. And it looks really slick to boot. What’s not to love?
Multi-Season Fun

Why pack away your Übertüb when it gets cold outside? Many of us remember hurtling ourselves down the snow-covered hills, bouncing harmlessly off jumps and bumps. Get your kids (young and old) outside in the winter to enjoy some healthy outdoor play.
Personalize or Repair

Make your Übertüb your very own. With a variety of instant-stick rubber patches in a variety of shapes, colors, and sizes, your tube will be one-of-a-kind. And while we have every confidence in our product’s durability, if you do somehow manage to spring a leak, simply fix it. Why throw away what can easily be made new again?
Recyclable
Designing for the environment is a key Übertüb company value. Every step of the manufacturing process has been designed to have a minimal impact on the environment. We even offer a replacement warranty…so if you ever find a way to destroy your Übertüb, we’ll take it back, and reprocess the rubber to produce new products. We are always thinking of ways to leave things a little better than we found them. And that means re-thinking how we build our product so that we remove waste from the equation.

Our corporation is founded on the idea that providing quality recreational equipment to kids young and old helps to promote wellness and happiness. We also have plans to establish or work with agencies that help encourage people to become more active and to get outside.

 Risks & Challenges 
We have worked very hard to line up quality manufacturers and suppliers to build the Übertüb. But bringing even the simplest of products to market is not without its challenges.

<p>Women of all sizes and shape have found the bungee strap one of the most loved things about NORB. If you have ever worn a range bag with a shoulder strap, you have probably experienced the frustration of it sliding off. This is where I started with the NORB series design. I wanted a strap that was thin enough to sit ""in"" your shoulder, much like a bra strap, comfortable either cross body or side carry, durable enough to handle and distribute the weight of all the gear, taking stress off your body while walking. Viola - the bungee strap was born and once you try it I think you too will be pleased with the result.</p>

<p>The NORB (No Ordinary Range Bag) series is designed around the busy lifestyle of women with jobs, kids, errands, training and range time.

<i>Is it a range bag or a concealed carry bag</i>?  </p>
<p>Why not both?  <span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">There are many women who carry the NORB original daily. The concept behind the NORB series was to create a bag that made range time for women easier while also being less obvious. Although conceal carry handbags look great, they typically can't handle the weight of all your range gear. With the NORB series, you get the best of both worlds: durable enough for all your gear AND stylish enough to be your every day conceal carry bag, too. </span></p>

</div></div>","Why lug around a purse AND a range bag?
Simplify your life with just one bag that is durable enough to handle all your range gear and fashionable enough to carry every day!



NORB-C (No Ordinary Range Bag - Compact)

 With your help and support, the NORB-C, will be headed to production.  The NORB-C is the newest range bag in the OffHand Gear series, and on this indiegogo page you will find details about NORB-C and exclusive rewards for your support.  For more information on the original NORB or other OffHand Gear products, please visit the website at www.OffHandGear.com.   



NORB-C has been on the design table for the last year. With prototyping now done, I am ready to add it to the line up and create a NORB series of bags. The original NORB ( No Ordinary Range Bag ) has been on the market for over a year and has been thoroughly tested and reviewed.  The NORB range bag is considered a unique, innovative product for female gun enthusiasts, and NORB-C will bring a smaller, more everyday option to the series.


NORB-C is the next step in creating an entire line of bags and gear designed completely around the needs and comfort of women.Casual shooters and professionals alike use, abuse and love the original NORB. After months of consistent use I have received emails from ladies about how impressed they are with the durability and functionality of NORB.  The same thought out design and materials will be used in the making of NORB-C. 


500 denier Cordura fabric from Kryptek Outdoor Group is water resistant 
Signature bungee strap
Brushed nickel metal hardware
Water resistant zippers
Built in range pads using SlipNot or tricot fabrics
Heavy duty Velcro
Military grade sewing
Made in the USA


 American made products for women that make self-protection and training easier and more comfortable.


 


Women of all sizes and shape have found the bungee strap one of the most loved things about NORB. If you have ever worn a range bag with a shoulder strap, you have probably experienced the frustration of it sliding off. This is where I started with the NORB series design. I wanted a strap that was thin enough to sit ""in"" your shoulder, much like a bra strap, comfortable either cross body or side carry, durable enough to handle and distribute the weight of all the gear, taking stress off your body while walking. Viola - the bungee strap was born and once you try it I think you too will be pleased with the result.





The NORB (No Ordinary Range Bag) series is designed around the busy lifestyle of women with jobs, kids, errands, training and range time. The NORB original bag stays slim while having room for a wallet, touch up makeup, hair ties, phone and of course all your range gear; magazines, ammo, eye and ear protection and even your cleaning kit!! 
No, there isn't room for the kitchen sink, but who needs one of those at the range?




Use it for the range or everyday... 
let the NORB series fit your busy lifestyle!

While the NORB-C is designed to hold less than its big sister - it still has plenty of room for your pistol (full size or compact), ammo, extra magazines, eye protection, phone, credit cards, keys, personal items, makeup bag & even a small tablet.










Is it a range bag or a concealed carry bag?  
Why not both?  There are many women who carry the NORB original daily. The concept behind the NORB series was to create a bag that made range time for women easier while also being less obvious. Although conceal carry handbags look great, they typically can't handle the weight of all your range gear. With the NORB series, you get the best of both worlds: durable enough for all your gear AND stylish enough to be your every day conceal carry bag, too. 








The perks in this Indiegogo campaign include the ability to choose which NORB is best for you.  If you are looking for a range bag that fits all your gear into one bag then NORB is the bag for you. If you are looking for something smaller for those quick trips, the NORB-C is the perfect choice.         
Your lifestyle. Your Range Bag.




The goal of $6700 on this project will provide all the materials and labor necessary for the first production run of NORB-C in the standard Kryptek Typhon fabric.  If and when the goal is exceeded, backers will receive an exclusive look at fabric choices and have the ability to vote on which fabric will be added to the series.




Once additional fabrics are voted on and added to the project, backers choosing the NORB-C reward level will have the choice between the standard Kryptek Typhon or the additional fabric choice(s) for their reward. 




Hello, my name is Sandi and I am the owner/designer of the OffHand Gear brand of products.  When I started this journey 3 years ago, it was with a strong desire to bring new, innovative women's products to the firearms industry. Not just pink colors on men's products, but actually designed to fit us women and our lifestyles. I started the company by designing three fun, USA made ladies t-shirts. Since then, I have expanded the brand to include quite a few more t-shirts, the NORB series and a selection of AR15 hand guards. In the future, I look forward to bringing you more products that are currently in design/development stage.  I hope you, the supporters, enjoy the brand, continue to use my products and above all else, find OffHand Gear makes your training easier, more frequent and even fun!







My suppliers and sewing partners are some of the best in the business and I have a solid working relationship with them. With NORB-C being the second bag in the series,  I do not foresee any issues with the delivery timeline.
I look forward to shipping your order and hearing how NORB has changed the way you feel about range bags. 
Thank you!
Sandi

<h3 style=""text-align: center;"">FAQ</h3>
<p><b>1. When can I choose the color of MySunBag?</b></p>
<p>We will send out a survey during the campaign in which you can
select your color. If you've purchased more than one MySunBag, you can choose
different colors! <br/>However MyParella comes in white only. </p>
<p><b>2. When will I receive MySunBag Original?</b></p>
<p>We can guarantee the first delivery to be shipped by mid-July.</p>
<p><b>3. How do I fill MySunBag with sand?</b></p>
<p>The double layered lining inside functions as a shovel, making it
easy to fill the bag with sand. Spread it on
the ground and collect the sand by pulling the lining up.</p>
<p><b>4. How do I empty MySunBag from the sand in the end of use?</b></p>
<p>Easy! Turn MySunBag upside down, grab the handle at the base of the bag and tip out the sand. </p>
<p><b>5. What is MyParella?</b></p>
<p>MyParella is a beach umbrella with a pole divided in to 3 parts. We nicknamed it MyParella (combining parasol and a beach umbrella).</p>
<p><b>6. </b><b>Does
MySunBag work with all beach umbrella size? </b></p>
<p>Yes, *all types of beach umbrellas up to 2m diameter will stand and hold, but only Myparella will be secured in a strong
wind. Hang the handles of MySunBag on the hook, attached to Myparella
pole. </p>
<p>*Make sure to take the tip at the end of the
pole out. </p>
<p><b>7. Can I play with the kids, lean or sit on MySunBag when
it full with sand?</b></p>
<p>Yes. Sure you can!</p>
<p><b style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">8. What kind of material is MySunBag made of?</b><br/></p>
<p>MySunBag is made from D600, a durable polyester fabric that is commonly used in the military industry. The inner bag is a 100% polyester.</p>
<p><b>9. Can I wash MySunBag using a laundry machine?</b> <br/>
Of course! The inner bag is easy to wash. But as for MySunBag a few grain
of sand will dry the day after and you can tip them off easily again anytime. We
don’t recommend machine wash to wash out sand. </p>
<p><b>10. Can you ship international?</b></p>
<p>Yes, we can ship worldwide.</p>
<p><b>11. Can I become a distributor?</b></p>
<p>Yes.  Please send us a private message
and we will get back to you. </p>
<p><b>12. Do you have a patent?</b></p>
<p>Yes. MySunBag is trademarked and registered
design in: Australia, Europe and Israel and soon pending
registration in the US. We will protect our Patents / brands / images /
retailers / resellers to the fullest extent of the law.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<p></p>
<h3 style=""text-align: center;""><b>Risks &amp; Challenges</b></h3>
<p></p>
<p>MySunBag is the first product in a series of exciting beach
accessories. This is our 1st Crowdfunding campaign and by demand we will <span style=""font-family: 'Benton Sans', Helvetica, sans-serif;letter-spacing: 0px;background-color: initial;"">Springboard a family of colorful and functional products under
the brand name ""creationb"" to use anywhere and anytime.</span></p>
<p>Along the process of development of creating
MySunBag we have realized it cannot be MySunBag without its MyParella.</p>
<p>Our challenge is to deliver up to 10,000 units of MySunBag kit before
the end of July 2016, without delay. </p>
<p>That's the only risk really.  </p>
<p>We believe that <b>everyone should have their own stylish portable shade </b><br/></p>

How it all began



In September 2014, my friends and I went camping for a weekend at the beach
and tried to set up a beach umbrella that kept on falling. We took a fabric bag and filled it with sand, using it as a strong base to anchor the beach umbrella. It worked! And inspired me to develop
and design a multi-purpose bag. 




The Design Process


The development process was fun and full of excitement. I sought to create a light, a durable product that is stable in a strong wind. 
In December 2014, Helek studio (textile design experts) and I started working together by testing three models of potential designs for MySunBag. 

The best design was made of a strong fabric with a rounded base which gave stability. It was able to hold a beach umbrella pole at various angles with a minimum amount of sand. 







In early 2015 we conducted field tests on the beach to test the bag's strength, using large and small beach umbrella adjustments to withstand strong winds.
By mid-2015 we had the final prototype. Meanwhile we concentrated
on customizing the perfect beach umbrella which we named MyParella, to fit into
MySunBag & with a special hook to secure it we are
ready to go!



MyParella 










MyParella together with MySunBag make a portable sun-shade kit.  Turning your day at the beach into an enjoyable and protected experience. 

Available now in three colors:


Red  


Yellow



Baby Blue






Reaching above 5,000 backers we select 3 different color Play

Choosing color will be at the end of the campaign!





· Just take MySunBag and go!













FAQ
1. When can I choose the color of MySunBag?
We will send out a survey during the campaign in which you can
select your color. If you've purchased more than one MySunBag, you can choose
different colors! However MyParella comes in white only. 
2. When will I receive MySunBag Original?
We can guarantee the first delivery to be shipped by mid-July.
3. How do I fill MySunBag with sand?
The double layered lining inside functions as a shovel, making it
easy to fill the bag with sand. Spread it on
the ground and collect the sand by pulling the lining up.
4. How do I empty MySunBag from the sand in the end of use?
Easy! Turn MySunBag upside down, grab the handle at the base of the bag and tip out the sand. 
5. What is MyParella?
MyParella is a beach umbrella with a pole divided in to 3 parts. We nicknamed it MyParella (combining parasol and a beach umbrella).
6. Does
MySunBag work with all beach umbrella size? 
Yes, *all types of beach umbrellas up to 2m diameter will stand and hold, but only Myparella will be secured in a strong
wind. Hang the handles of MySunBag on the hook, attached to Myparella
pole. 
*Make sure to take the tip at the end of the
pole out. 
7. Can I play with the kids, lean or sit on MySunBag when
it full with sand?
Yes. Sure you can!
8. What kind of material is MySunBag made of?
MySunBag is made from D600, a durable polyester fabric that is commonly used in the military industry. The inner bag is a 100% polyester.
9. Can I wash MySunBag using a laundry machine? 
Of course! The inner bag is easy to wash. But as for MySunBag a few grain
of sand will dry the day after and you can tip them off easily again anytime. We
don’t recommend machine wash to wash out sand. 
10. Can you ship international?
Yes, we can ship worldwide.
11. Can I become a distributor?
Yes.  Please send us a private message
and we will get back to you. 
12. Do you have a patent?
Yes. MySunBag is trademarked and registered
design in: Australia, Europe and Israel and soon pending
registration in the US. We will protect our Patents / brands / images /
retailers / resellers to the fullest extent of the law.


Risks & Challenges

MySunBag is the first product in a series of exciting beach
accessories. This is our 1st Crowdfunding campaign and by demand we will Springboard a family of colorful and functional products under
the brand name ""creationb"" to use anywhere and anytime.
Along the process of development of creating
MySunBag we have realized it cannot be MySunBag without its MyParella.
Our challenge is to deliver up to 10,000 units of MySunBag kit before
the end of July 2016, without delay. 
That's the only risk really.  
We believe that everyone should have their own stylish portable shade

<p><strong>MIND THE GAP</strong> <strong>WATCHES</strong> was started by me, entrepreneur and watch lover Ryan Twomey. I was fed up with constantly seeing minimalist watches that had unoriginal dressy/ luxury designs, low quality materials, and excessive retail mark-ups. I wanted a watch built to match the casual/laid back sense of style that I and so many others enjoy. So, I set out to build Mind the Gap watches with <strong>4 things in mind: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Casual appeal FIRST then professional</strong></li>
<li><strong>High quality materials/movement </strong></li>
<li><strong>Fairly priced (half of what our competitors cost)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Contemporary, urban design</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1498278852/rblshwki9niuexdrzdnv.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Mind The Gap watches are built for the people who would rather kick back with some friends and order a pizza than go to a nice dinner. Our watches boast a texture on their faces similar to that of the grip tape on a skateboard giving it an urban, familiar feel. The bracelets have shoestring aglets on the end to compliment the urban style of the watches. The name pays homage to the the London underground which is the inspiration behind the brand. The unique style sets itself apart from other minimalist watches. The price is unbeatable and the quality is unmatched. </p>
<p>Even though our watches and bracelets are crafted to be casual, they still will look great in a professional and even classy setting when you need them to.<strong> (scroll down to see all the styles)</strong></p>

<p>You might be thinking to yourself, How can we afford to sell $120 watches for $55?</p>
<p>Well. Basically by being honest, not greedy, and selling a product for a value of what it's actually worth rather than it's perceived worth. There is nothing proprietary about our methods; we just wanted to save you as much as possible. Also, having a single owner helps too!</p>
<p>We are going to work hard to continue this in the future by nixing things like expensive ad campaigns so we can consistently deliver our product at an affordable price.</p>
<p><strong>We remove unnecessary mark-ups which sometimes can be upwards of 1000%!</strong></p>

<p>In keeping with<strong> our philosophy for quality and affordable prices</strong>, we negotiated hard with our suppliers to make sure we get the<strong> best possible prices</strong> for all the materials and parts we use in our watches. We then passed these cost savings directly to you, our Indiegogo supporter! </p>

<p>I created this brand to <strong>help</strong> the people like me express their true style with a fashionable casual watch. The principles that this brand is built on are to be <strong>honest</strong>, <strong>transparent</strong> and to give a <strong>fair price</strong> to everyone. We will never increase our prices just to increase our profits. We didn't only do this for us. We did this for you because we understand. We put every penny we had into starting this company, into the research and development, designs, and plenty of samples making sure it would be perfect for you. </p>
<p> We hope we did a good enough job! If not, please let us know how we can improve. We will be happy to answer any questions you may have!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>Most of the proceeds from this campaign will go into creating a whole line of quality, popularly priced watches. Your money will make it possible for young professionals to look good and make impressions on people during the most financially vulnerable time in their lives.</p>
<p>Along with this, if we raise</p>
<ul>
<li>$15,000-20,000 --&gt; 10% of all the proceeds from the bracelets will be donated to the Wounded Warrior foundation and to programs that help with the rehabilitation of our troops.</li>
<li>$20,001-50,000 --&gt; 15% of all the proceeds from the bracelets will be donated to the Wounded Warrior foundation and to programs that help with the rehabilitation of our troops.</li>

<li>&gt;$100,001--&gt; 50% of all the proceeds from the bracelets will be donated to the wounded warrior foundation and to programs that help with the rehabilitation of our troops.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are a company that believes in helping others when we can, so we are going to take advantage of this opportunity and not only help save you money but also improve the lives of our military men, women and their families around the country.</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>Every company has obstacles to overcome and even though we are such a young company, we still have our fair share. One obstacle is the wait time. It takes 30 days for the production order to be finished so the sooner we raise the funds, the sooner we can place the order and the sooner you will get your watch! Our main obstacle, though, is the funding needed to cover the initial minimum order which is why we have come to Indiegogo! We will place the order as soon as possible so we can get your watches shipped to your door on time!</p>
<p>Also we will need your help to keep the momentum going once the campaign ends so we can keep providing these watches to the people who need them!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>If you can't contribute but you want to support us, share us with your friends and family to get the word out! Any little contribution works; even if it's you just telling one friend, we would be forever grateful! We need as many people as possible to get the word out and make some noise about this campaign. We want you to<strong> BE A REBEL</strong> with Mind The Gap Watches and <strong>set yourself apart from the crowd.</strong></p>

*Drop a comment with the Country or State you are from. At the end of the campaign we are going to select TWO people who comment to win a second watch for free! (1 random, 1 for the furthest order)
MIND THE GAP WATCHES was started by me, entrepreneur and watch lover Ryan Twomey. I was fed up with constantly seeing minimalist watches that had unoriginal dressy/ luxury designs, low quality materials, and excessive retail mark-ups. I wanted a watch built to match the casual/laid back sense of style that I and so many others enjoy. So, I set out to build Mind the Gap watches with 4 things in mind: 

Casual appeal FIRST then professional
High quality materials/movement 
Fairly priced (half of what our competitors cost)
Contemporary, urban design



Mind The Gap watches are built for the people who would rather kick back with some friends and order a pizza than go to a nice dinner. Our watches boast a texture on their faces similar to that of the grip tape on a skateboard giving it an urban, familiar feel. The bracelets have shoestring aglets on the end to compliment the urban style of the watches. The name pays homage to the the London underground which is the inspiration behind the brand. The unique style sets itself apart from other minimalist watches. The price is unbeatable and the quality is unmatched. 
Even though our watches and bracelets are crafted to be casual, they still will look great in a professional and even classy setting when you need them to. (scroll down to see all the styles)



We have purchased the molds, solidified our designs, and received our samples. Now, all we need to do is start manufacturing, which is where you come in! We have been in contact with the manufacturer for months and have created a strong relationship. Once we raise enough to cover the initial manufacturing order we will be able to bring these watches to life for you! We are offering 10 different watch variations just so we can make sure we have a style you can enjoy. All the while you take on zero risk. If we do not reach our goal we will refund all money to all of our awesome backers!
We have everything ready and the only missing piece we have left is you! We are prepared to fulfill all of our orders on time. We have a history with shipping in bulk from other businesses and we will be able to get these watches sent out effectively and efficiently!

RETAIL PRICE: $75 | EARLY BIRD PRICE: $55, Savings: $20-$85 (27%) |INDIEGOGO PRICE: $65, Savings: $10-$30 (15%)
Did I mention.... FREE DOMESTIC SHIPPING?
Four face designs: 

MTG(001) - Black 
MTG(002) - White 
MTG(003) - Red 
MTG(004) - Grey

Three band types

Tan genuine leather
Black genuine leather
Black solid stainless steel











 
 
BRACELETS

 
If you are unfamiliar with what a ""perk"" is or how Indiegogo works, please check out this link!
https://support.indiegogo.com/hc/en-us/articles... Basically, you are placing a pre-order for the watch and once I receive enough pre-orders, I will be able to fund the initial production order and you will get your watch, if I don't reach my goal you get your money back!

You might be thinking to yourself, How can we afford to sell $120 watches for $55?
Well. Basically by being honest, not greedy, and selling a product for a value of what it's actually worth rather than it's perceived worth. There is nothing proprietary about our methods; we just wanted to save you as much as possible. Also, having a single owner helps too!
We are going to work hard to continue this in the future by nixing things like expensive ad campaigns so we can consistently deliver our product at an affordable price.
We remove unnecessary mark-ups which sometimes can be upwards of 1000%!

In keeping with our philosophy for quality and affordable prices, we negotiated hard with our suppliers to make sure we get the best possible prices for all the materials and parts we use in our watches. We then passed these cost savings directly to you, our Indiegogo supporter! 




 


Built to look casual first then professional.
Urban minimalist design
European inspiration
Fair value price
Case diameter is the perfect size built to fit any size wrist (40mm)
Unique bracelet accent piece

There are many things that separate us from the competition but those are just a few! We have created the perfect blend of affordability and quality. 


Case Material: 316 low carbon, surgical grade stainless steel with Ion Plating
Case diameter: 40mm 
Face diameter: 34mm
Bezel width: 3mm
Band Material: 316L solid stainless steel or Genuine leather
Band width: 20mm
Buckle width: 25mm
Buckle material: 316L surgical grade solid stainless steel
Window material: hardened crystal mineral glass
Movement: Precision Japanese Quartz Miyota 2115
Water resistance: 5ATM (swimming, showers and light water use)

Japanese quartz watches are equipped with innovative and powerful features. Overall, Japanese quartz watches are known for accuracy and precision. In fact, they were used as the official timekeeper in many Olympic events.
Because they don’t have as many mechanical-moving parts, quartz watches last (almost) forever and require no maintenance (other than changing the battery every 3-5 years).
We are also so confident in our watches that we are proud to offer a two year manufacturer warranty!

Easy pull pin release makes switching out bands a breeze, even the stainless steel!

<h3>Why We Started This Company</h3>
<p>We started Trax Supply Co. with a mission. To create a brand of apparel that helps both the consumer AND the environment. You shouldn't have to make sacrifices on either end, and we're here to prove that.<br/><br/>We live in a time now where companies thrive in a ""fast fashion"" industry of cheap clothes and huge amounts of waste, leading to huge pollution for the environment. In the United States alone it's estimated that we throw away over 15 MILLION POUNDS of clothing each year. Not to mention the huge amounts of water used and carbon emitted during the manufacturing process.</p>
<p>Trax Supply Co. aims to answer the call for quality without the sacrifice of eco-friendly. Everything from our fabrics (<a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-dietz/organic-cotton-sustainable-fashion_b_3562788.html"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">organic cotton</a>, <a href=""https://theswatchbook.offsetwarehouse.com/2015/01/29/what-is-recycled-polyester/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">recycled polyester</a>, and <a href=""http://www.merino.com/wool/the-fibre/merino-wool-explained/"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Merino Wool</a>) to the ink we use (discharge, a water-based ink meaning no PVC plastics in our dying processes) to the box that ships to your door (a lovely 100% recycled kraft paper)</p>
<h3> </h3>
<h3>Why We Started This Campaign</h3>
<p>Which brings us to our Indiegogo campaign, and how you can help make that message a greater reality. We are launching our MerinoWear Collection through this campaign. These shirts are incredibly well fit for any environment or occasion, be it at the gym or on the road.</p>
<p>But being a small start-up, we don't have the budget for beginning inventory. This is where you come in. On top of being able to help us launch, you will also be given a substantial discount, getting our titular MerinoWear Shirts for $15 compared to their retail of $25 (some companies get away with charging $70 for these shirts. How, we don't know.)</p>
<p> </p>
<h3>What is the Merino Collection?</h3>
<p>Our Merino Wool shirts are designed to keep you cool and comfortable in any environment. Merino Wool has amazing moisture-wicking properties that come in handy on hot summer days, as it pulls the sweat off of your body to evaporate, while it's temperature regulating means you keep in body heat during colder days. This makes it a perfect fabric for odor-resistance and incredibly useful for those looking to handle any weather. Our Canadian-manufactured Merino Wool is sustainably sourced and at the end of its long life, the fabric is biodegradable which leaves less of a hassle on the environment!</p>
<p>The current collection of Merino Wool shirts features our Unisex Short Sleeve, Women's Short Sleeve, and Unisex Long Sleeve.</p>

<p> </p>
<h3>Other Fabrics We Use</h3>
<p>We also produce two other blends for our products. Our Graphic Tees and Sweatshirts are an eco-Blend, made up of 50% RECYCLED polyester, 37% ORGANIC cotton, and 17% rayon. Our Tank Tops are a unique yet useful Bamboo-Blend, made up of 70% viscose bamboo and 30% ORGANIC cotton. The Bamboo-Blend is naturally moisture-wicking, much like our MerinoWear fabric, and will keep you cool on any adventure.</p>
<p>These two fabrics are not only comfortable and a higher quality than most common/mainstream fabrics, but they are more environmentally friendly and sustainably sourced!</p>

<h3>The Impact - Eco-Friendly, Wallet-Friendly</h3>
<p>The textile and apparel industry is the second biggest contributor to waste and pollution. Not to mention the plastics, water waste, and other environmentally harmful chemicals that go in to the production of these clothes. That is why eco-blends and sustainable sourced/crafted apparel is the future of the clothing industry. We embody our message through our products and processes, and eliminating the waste and harmful compounds of today's garments while raising the bar for consumer quality is how Trax Supply Co. aims to set a precedent for the clothing industry.</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>As we said before, being an incredibly small company means we cannot right now afford the large investment of starting inventory and equipment. With your contributions though, these beginning challenges will be overcome and we can establish an inventory and purchase the necessary equipment to run daily operations fluidly and efficiently!</p>
<p> </p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways to Help Us</h3>

By giving us any bit of support, you show us that our message matters!</p>

The Impact - Eco-Friendly, Wallet-Friendly
The textile and apparel industry is the second biggest contributor to waste and pollution. Not to mention the plastics, water waste, and other environmentally harmful chemicals that go in to the production of these clothes. That is why eco-blends and sustainable sourced/crafted apparel is the future of the clothing industry. We embody our message through our products and processes, and eliminating the waste and harmful compounds of today's garments while raising the bar for consumer quality is how Trax Supply Co. aims to set a precedent for the clothing industry.
 

Risks & Challenges
As we said before, being an incredibly small company means we cannot right now afford the large investment of starting inventory and equipment. With your contributions though, these beginning challenges will be overcome and we can establish an inventory and purchase the necessary equipment to run daily operations fluidly and efficiently!
 

Other Ways to Help Us
Regardless of if you can or can't purchase one of our perks, we still are incredibly thankful for any amount of help you can give us! Whether it's SHARING our campaign on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, etc., or simply getting the word out about our brand by word of mouth, we appreciate any bit of help! By giving us any bit of support, you show us that our message matters!
We truly hope you believe in our mission as much as we do, enough to help us grow and expand and further our efforts to creating eco-friendly, quality apparel.",4.0,0,"1 Campaign

<p><strong>A CLASSIC CHRONOGRAPH REBORN</strong></p>
<p>Inspired by the chronographs of the 70s where racing and the smell of burning asphalt was a staple. These watches were easily distinguishable from other vintage models. A glance at the owner’s wrist was enough to see the model he was wearing. Many classics were made during this period, and it is time to bring them back with a modern twist.</p>

<p>A symmetrical watch is the key design feature we wanted. We etched our trademark ""<strong>M</strong>"" on the crown to remind us that the watches we create are for the true gentleman. Every detail is essential. With a 10mm thick case, we made sure we got the size of the buttons right. With soft push reflex buttons and a crown with a 90 degree catch, you can be sure setting of the time and usage of the stopwatch function will be precise and accurate. </p>

</div></div>","A CLASSIC CHRONOGRAPH REBORN
Inspired by the chronographs of the 70s where racing and the smell of burning asphalt was a staple. These watches were easily distinguishable from other vintage models. A glance at the owner’s wrist was enough to see the model he was wearing. Many classics were made during this period, and it is time to bring them back with a modern twist.
 

 
THE PANDA AND REVERSE PANDA 
We are pulling out something that has worked and was coveted by many in years gone by. As a matter of fact, it never went out of style. The Panda and Reverse Panda dials are icons in their own right. 
 

 
 


 

 
WHAT WE BELIEVE IN : AFFORDABILITY: Under $200 on Indiegogo. Delivering directly to the customer, we pass the savings to you with radical transparency in a quality watch.  PRACTICALITY: A precise, handmade watch good enough for everyday use. Functional and wearable in all situations. DESIGN: Beautifully crafted for timelessness in a vintage design. No funky shapes or colors. Just a classic timepiece.
 
 
 
WHY A CHRONOGRAPH?
We wanted to create a classic racing chronograph watch that captures the elegance and speed of a racing champion. The Ranomo Chronograph embodies the soul and adrenaline rush of conquering impossible speeds.
 

 
Providing affordable watches with quality is what Monsieur Watches aim for with each series. Ranomo is coined with two words in mind ""Racing and Monochrome"". The bold, classic and rounded features symbolise racing around bends on a track. The monochromatic look is characterised by the black and white choice of dials in this iconic series. The Panda and Reverse Panda dials will always make one take a second look, and that's exactly what we want to emulate with our rendition of a classic.
 

 

 
 
RANOMO CHRONOGRAPH REVERSE PANDA (Japanese Miyota 0S21) features a date function at the 6 o'clock position. The hour and minute hands are illumed and finished with a mirror polish.

<p>The Minder alerts you and others if you are standing too close when out in public. It helps to enforce and train social distancing skills for people getting out into public who have a hard time remembering to keep a safe distance from others, such as people with dementia. </p>
<p><i><strong>Just put it on and turn it on. </strong></i></p>
<p>The Minder is simple to use. It senses when you are closer than 6 feet (2m) to someone and gives a gentle reminder to keep a safe distance. No phone needed.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://goodrobot.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Minder_put_on_both.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Easily swap between the lanyard and clip. You have options on how to wear it.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://goodrobot.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Minder_Assemble_Lanyard_FAST.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>The Minder uses a state of the art infrared distance sensor to track when something is in front of you. It can see changes of distance smaller than one inch (about 1cm) and works well in most environments including sunlight.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://goodrobot.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Minder_explainer_a_short.gif"" src=""""/></p>

<p>Don’t worry, The Minder is not the annoyer. It ignores when you are using your phone, standing closer than 3 feet (1m) to other things, or if someone is just walking by you.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://goodrobot.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/minder_ignore.gif"" src=""""/></p>

<p>We have been working on The Minder for months and are ready with a production design and to produce it locally in the USA. One thing we have learned during the pandemic is that the manufacturing supply chain for making most consumer products does not work well during times like this. When launching new products, you need to be at a factory to check things as they come off the production line to insure quality. On the other hand, we need jobs here. When developing The Minder we looked at all of the different technologies to scale The Minder quickly and locally but keep the costs competitive.</p>
<h3>Developing The Minder</h3>
<p>The idea for The Minder started out as a wearable to help you know when you are touching your face, but we saw that more people were interested in something to help enforce good social distancing when in public. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://goodrobot.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Minder_Development_Phases_sm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>First we hacked together a working prototype to test the parts we wanted to use and get it tested out.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://goodrobot.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Minder_Rough_proto.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p>After that we developed a design for the circuit and the board layout.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://goodrobot.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Minder_Board_Layout.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Had a batch of PCBs (printed circuit boards) made to do a small run of that. </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://goodrobot.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Minder_PCBA_in_Board_Vice_sm.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>From there we focused on the casing design and making it good for manufacturing.</p>
<p> </p>

<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://goodrobot.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Minder_PCB2Casing_ASM.gif"" src=""""/></p>

<p>The resin printing which uses UV cured urethane based resins gives us very precise output without using injection molding. This means we can improve the design and quickly iterate the casings using the same materials and processes as the final product without any lead time.

<h3>Bringing it all together, modular manufacturing.</h3>
<p>We think that local production of small to medium batches of products is the way to go. We've recently seen examples of what happens with expensive and proprietary manufacturing equipment when factory technicians are unable to travel to repair it in person. We avoid this by creating modular production cells using commodity or open source hardware. We built it so we can easily service it. It also reduces the first costs to set up a factory and the cost of growing production capacity.</p>
<p>This means that creating new products is less expensive by reducing the sunk costs of starting production and reducing the time of having products in hand. </p>
<p>Producing products on demand avoids the largest risks of managing a hardware company: inventory and lead times. Software now iterates quickly, making small changes constantly. Companies like Tesla have gone a step further, iterating hardware by enabling constant design improvements introduced at the production level. We bring the same approach to consumer electronics, getting products to market faster and at smaller batch volumes using local production while being cost competitive. We plan to start here in Georgia and will grow geographically, bringing jobs to people across the country and globally while making things needed by their neighbors not someone halfway across the world. </p>
<p>How many jobs can you help create? Roughly for every 1000 units we sell a month, it will create a full time job within Good Robot. That isn't something you get when buying from a traditional retailer that sells mostly imported products. </p>

<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://goodrobot.tech/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Minder_Jon_200.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Good Robot was founded by Jon Buford, an industry veteran in consumer products and industrial automation. He found himself in his home town in Georgia, USA when the COVID-19 hit. Using his mechanical and electronics design skills, he developed The Minder with the help of friends and family both there and abroad. </p>
<h2>Risks and Challenges</h2>
<p>The biggest risk and challenge right now is just the general uncertainty we are all dealing with. The team is doing everything to stay healthy. We've created a supply chain we control very closely and have options for alternate suppliers for most anything. We are keeping the operations small, but we will design the production facilities and systems to make social distancing part of the process as we grow. None of us really know how the current situation will come out, but we are taking all precautions we can to avoid unnecessary risks. </p>
<p>On the other hand, we have reduced the normal production startup risk that is part of hardware products by developing the product to the production stage using the same methods and materials as the final manufacturing. This avoids the big jump found when transitioning from prototype to production. We designed our production to be modular to make it possible to ramp up to almost any volume needed within months with a gradual increase in production equipment and workers that grows together. By eliminating the geographic jump, we have avoided the traditional back and forth and inevitable misunderstandings and time to resolve those that are part of traditional manufacturing.</p>
<p>The targets of 100 units in September and 1000 units in October are ones we can hit with our existing equipment and team. We do feel that we have put enough testing in to grow our manufacturing resources over that time to support orders that we are able to get from this campaign and deliver them by December. </p>

</div></div>","The Minder alerts you and others if you are standing too close when out in public. It helps to enforce and train social distancing skills for people getting out into public who have a hard time remembering to keep a safe distance from others, such as people with dementia. 
Just put it on and turn it on. 
The Minder is simple to use. It senses when you are closer than 6 feet (2m) to someone and gives a gentle reminder to keep a safe distance. No phone needed.

Easily swap between the lanyard and clip. You have options on how to wear it.

The Minder uses a state of the art infrared distance sensor to track when something is in front of you. It can see changes of distance smaller than one inch (about 1cm) and works well in most environments including sunlight.


Don’t worry, The Minder is not the annoyer. It ignores when you are using your phone, standing closer than 3 feet (1m) to other things, or if someone is just walking by you.

If you need to get close something but don’t want to turn off The Minder, just wave your hand to pause notifications. 

 

We have been working on The Minder for months and are ready with a production design and to produce it locally in the USA. One thing we have learned during the pandemic is that the manufacturing supply chain for making most consumer products does not work well during times like this. When launching new products, you need to be at a factory to check things as they come off the production line to insure quality. On the other hand, we need jobs here. When developing The Minder we looked at all of the different technologies to scale The Minder quickly and locally but keep the costs competitive.
Developing The Minder
The idea for The Minder started out as a wearable to help you know when you are touching your face, but we saw that more people were interested in something to help enforce good social distancing when in public. 

First we hacked together a working prototype to test the parts we wanted to use and get it tested out.

After that we developed a design for the circuit and the board layout.

Had a batch of PCBs (printed circuit boards) made to do a small run of that. 

From there we focused on the casing design and making it good for manufacturing.
 

 

Normally we would send this design to manufacturers overseas to get quotes for production costs, but, pandemic. Instead, we are taking this opportunity to build up local manufacturing using technology that fits creating small factories that can make tens of thousands of things a month. 
Making The Minder

The Minder will be the first product from Good Robot. We are establishing our manufacturing system that is both scalable and allows for flexible production. At the core of our manufacturing are two basic technologies: Resin 3D Printing and Open Source PCBA equipment.

We can have different colors, test new features, and even make one-off customized plastic with your name or your cat’s photo on it.

A multi-functional tool that keeps you informed so you can focus on riding without being distracted!No matter if you are going for a quick ride or you are planning a tour over several days, Motobit Sentinel is always there to join you and provides you valuable riding and road information with strong vibrations so you do not need to take your eyes off the road.Motobit Sentinel provides various information about what's ahead of you. Ranging from radar controls, road and traffic information, or sudden weather changes: there is a lot of useful information to benefit from while riding. You decide what to get informed! With the support of Motobit you can challenge ALL the roads: Stay safe and get notified if you are approaching a curve too fast based on YOUR PERSONAL riding behavior!How can Motobit Sentinel know how I ride my motorcycle you ask?Our algorithms analyze the data provided by the sensors of Motobit Sentinel and your smartphone to understand how you usually approach curves! Approaching speed, cornering speed, lean angle, braking deceleration and road geometry are just some of the information used to determine your personal riding behavior.A single tour with curvy roads provides all needed information for Motobit to define YOUR PERSONAL riding behavior. Your profile will grow with you and gets more accurate the more you ride!Combine YOUR PERSONAL riding behavior with a detailed road database and you get an expert motorcycle riding companion always with you. Never be surprised of challenging curves and unknown road sections: Moments like “This was a close one!” are a thing of the past! Motobit Sentinel does not only increase your riding safety,  but it also helps to AVOID fines too: set a personal speed limit tolerance for each road type and get notified if you exceed it.It is easy to overlook a speed limit, but Motobit Sentinel has got you covered!If something unexpected happens, you can alert your emergency contacts with a simple touch of the easy-to-reach button on Motobit Sentinel.A text message with your position will be sent to your emergency contacts, that can come to help you or alert the rescue forces so that you can get support as soon as possible.With Motobit Sentinel you can be sure to never lose your friends while riding in a group!Connect several Motobit Sentinel devices and define a maximal distance. As soon as one of your group members exceeds this distance, other motorcyclists of the group will be informed.Do you know that every time that you take your eyes away from the road to check your dashboard, smartphone, or navigation system you are riding blind for almost 2 seconds? At 90 kph this is equal to riding blindfolded for around half a football field!For this reason, Motobit Sentinel is designed to inform you through powerful vibrations, so that you can keep your eyes on the road while riding.If you are wondering if your smartwatch can do the same, forget it! We have developed dozens of prototypes and found a solution that is powerful enough to be perceived no matter which motorcycle you ride!Do you have tight racing gloves or are used to wear a watch or a bracelet while riding?Do not worry: Motobit Sentinel is designed to be used in many positions, with a strap, a clip, or as it is: Simply put Motobit Sentinel in your jacket pocket, attach it to your trousers' belt or kidney belt and continue to enjoy riding with maximum comfort while Motobit Sentinel is watching your back!Accompanying the Motobit Sentinel is the Motobit app.Connect Motobit Sentinel to your smartphone with the latest Bluetooth 5.0 technology built-in the device to have access to all its features and much more.In the Motobit app, you can find a resume of your rides with a detailed analysis made possible by our advanced algorithms, ready to be shared with your friends or other motorcyclists.Moreover, through the Motobit app, you will have the possibility to update the software of Motobit Sentinel to receive also future features.If you are still asking yourself why you should choose Motobit Sentinel instead of using or combining different tools such as a smartwatch or a navigation device?Check out how Motobit Sentinel stands out in comparison with other devices, that are commonly used by motorcyclists.We designed Motobit Sentinel with one goal: TO IMPROVE YOUR SAFETY while motorcycling.It does not matter which motorbike you ride or for how long you have been on the road, Motobit Sentinel will watch your back during all your future rides. Motobit Sentinel will come with an interchangeable silicone strap using a 22mm quick-release mechanism as well as a detachable clip for maximum comfort. For charging purposes, a USB cable using a magnetic connector also comes in the box. That's all you need to getup and running! We are passionate motorcyclists, just like you.As much as we love motorcycling, we realized how dangerous it can be.Intending to improve motorcycle safety for everyone, we founded motobit GmbH.Since the start of this project, a lot of things happened: we got incubated in Science Park Graz, one of the most important high-tech startup incubators in Austria, and received public support for our research work from both FFG and AWS, two of the biggest nation-wide research funding institutions.We found new motivated team members who share our passion.We hit the road a lot on our Ducati Scrambler and Kawasaki ER-6n to test both the Motobit app and Motobit Sentinel (and had a lot of fun doing it).We made a lot of new friends that helped us to bring Motobit Sentinel a step further with their suggestions and feedback.It was a long journey that glued us together even stronger to become motorcyclists to make motorcycle riding safer!Ride safe,Alessio & NickAs being motorcyclists ourselves, we know what a risk is.This is our first crowdfunding campaign but we are working on Motobit Sentinel for more than two years and have already taken many measures to mitigate risks.We have already found a European manufacturing partner for Motobit Sentinel as well as a logistic partner for fulfilling the shipment of the perks.Moreover, we have already developed an Android version of the Motobit app, that is available in the countries of Austria, Germany, and Italy and can count of more than 2000 active users.We are committed to the highest standards of excellence in safety and transparency alike. We will keep backers updated at every step of the way, and in case any changes, delays, or other incidences occur; we will inform our backers immediately and honestly.  We have different communication channels open for every backer or any person who is interested in our safety solution.

After analyzing the cost of production and packaging. The product will be sold in pairs, in red, blue, black, green, orange, purple, and pink. We are looking to raise $7,500 to manufacture 1,000 pieces of this wrist rest.   Jose T, NYC“Due to daily use of my PC, working my home-based business online, I tend to have discomfort on my right wrist. I learned about the wrist support tool from WRISTELITE from a very good friend of mine. He told me about the benefits of the technology that’s being used to make this product so unique and worth the money to invest in. I wasn’t convinced until I actually bought it and tried it for myself. And I have to “write” (say)… while I’m using it at this moment… what a relief!” Georges J, Switzerland“It’s comforting for computer users to know that wristelite would be beneficial in minimizing carpal-tunnel syndrome as well as tendonitis. This should be the primary focus of the info on the other site. Good day to you and your staff sir.” Bruce W, NYC“Hello, I host a talk show here in New York City. We like your product. We’d like to talk about it on the show. We may even want to give out multiple quantities of them to viewers as giveaways. Please let us know if you’re interested in working together on this.”  As with most crowdfunding projects, there may be some unexpected circumstances and or scenarios; but our team is fully prepared to take on any challenges by virtue of our full preparedness and crowdfunding experience. If we do run into any logistical challenges so significant that may delay us, we will be sure to keep all our contributors in the loop  In addition to supporting this project with your donation, you can also show your support by sharing a link to this campaign on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and any other social media platforms you use. The more people that are aware the more it will make this campaign a success.  NOTEWristelite.com does not make any medical claim as to cure or prevent Carpal Tunnel Syndrome or other repetitive motion injuries. In as much as this product has been proven to elevate and stabilize the hand during use. It is no substitution for proper seat height and back positioning on the part of the user. Moreover, if the user already suffers from a moderate to the severe case of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome or any similar conditions, it strongly recommended to seek the services of a professional physician.",47.0,0,"1 Campaign

<h3>Short Summary</h3>
<p>Hi I'm Hugo Moreno a software engineer who recently got into the trend of using A.I for various purposes. It occurred to me that maybe A.I could be used to translate sign language after I saw a YouTuber go through a rather odd experience in a McDonald's drive through:  I thought that it wasn't really inclusive but I had to think bigger.</p>
<p>The fact is there is a lot of people, around 5% of the worlds population, that are hard of hearing, so I though of a device that will help them communicate not just in one scenario but everywhere, like a universal translator, for all deaf people, and help reach towards a society that's more inclusive.</p>
<p>Imagine if you can be the founding stone that brought something of value, not just another device, but a life-changing-wearable that sparked hope and inclusiveness into the world, to be rewarded in kind knowing you helped millions and brought awareness while making this planet a better place to live for a huge minority!</p>
</div><div>
<h3>What We Need &amp; What You Get</h3>
<p>Ok, so,  how much exactly do we need?  We estimated that about 5000 dollars in order to build the prototype, if that sounds a lot let me explain exactly why that amount:</p>
<p>First things first, the suppliers: this device will use a dedicated mobile CPU from a smartphone supplier, as you can tell by now (you may ask why don't we just release an app?) the software will run differently depending on the hardware its run into, that means we had to contact several suppliers of mobile CPU's that can help us, so that everyone gets the best experience possible, equally, and flagship phones are pretty robust at running this sort of applications, but not everyone has a cutting edge flagship phone, so we are trying to make it accessible by using these components for an specific function.</p>
<p>It will also need cameras: yeap, again the ones you will usually found in a smartphone! Now you won't exactly take video whit this device,  so high resolution shouldn't be an issue right? Well yes and no, while we don't exactly need the best resolution,  we do need variable focal distances lenses, so that it can run detection at short and medium distances and still translate.</p>
<p>Also research and development: creating any device takes a lot of money not just creating it but receiving the parts, the manufacturers won't let you buy just one or two! They require a bulk order: if you order a few pieces from china, most likely they will sell you 50 at the time, minimum order. Again that's for one component, imagine one that is around 60-80 dollars, and you have to buy 100, you can see how things starts to add up the cost of research and development.</p>
<p>We want to be fully transparent with what we receive from you, so every order of components will have a screenshot of the amount spent on it.</p>
<p>Now what would you receive from funding a prototype? you may ask, why not just wait till you can buy it later?, well you get to be the one who actually make this happen, and we intend to reward you fully for it.</p>
<p>We want to keep things simple, for helping us realize our vision and help mankind, we want to offer you a discount coupon up to 40% ,depending on your contribution amount,  for the final product, also no matter your contribution, if you want to buy it, your version will be a limited edition with a special logo engraved on the device with your name on it. </p>
<p>A special accessory pack that has the wrist straps and neodymium magnetic holder will also be included in the ""Champion of the People"" supporter gift pack.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1613760525/notha6sakpc9kpojm4ly.png"" src=""""/>The logo shows a sound wave with a negated symbol all single lined to form a face, and a hand displaying the ""thank you"" gesture in sign language.</p>

<p>This is  a design for the magnetic holster, it will detach from the back and be able to stick to any metal surface, we designed it this way so that the 4 points attachment will never create a sag effect on your shirt, all while being compact and not noticeable that your wearing it in your shirt, apart from the weight of course, and the separation improves possible thermal dissipation issues (we are obsessed with thermals!) between the device and your skin isolating you from prolonged use heat, like any electronic device would.</p>

<p>we will also ship you with a couple of NATO style wrist straps in the pack</p>
<p>We really hope to reach our funding goals, but even if we don't, we will figure out how to reach the maximum level of completion possible with the amount given</p>
</div><div>
<h3>The Impact</h3>
<p>The main differentiating factor is the flexibility this product bring to the end user, since you can use it anywhere or with anything, a deaf person can easily communicate at the airport, or at a restaurant for example</p>
<p>If you think of it, look at how hard it would be if you try to express yourself without sound in any environment and you will see that its in the simplest of scenarios that this device will make the real impact, whether is at a bank or simply asking for help</p>
<p>Sign language requires both hands (with a few exception of gestures) so having a device that can be set everywhere comfortably, allows for ease of operation, also it can be used in conjunction with other devices like your phone, your laptop, or any device that accepts voice as an input, like an Amazon Echo</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Risks &amp; Challenges</h3>
<p>We can resume our challenges in two ways the software side and the hardware side</p>
<p>From the software point of view, training such a large dataset takes time but we can find ways to speed up the process more efficiently, without loosing quality of detection, such challenges are already on the way of being worked on</p>
<p>From the hardware side, the main challenge is getting the parts from the suppliers, and after that setting up a Research and development team to integrate every piece into a fully functional prototype</p>
<p>The main risk lies within budget constraints that limits the user experience, and possible hardware limitations for such a demanding task, universal translators exist, but gestures are way more difficult, that's why we need the right hardware and the fastest and lightest software possible to make it work, so far we have proven it to work, finding if its scalable to thousands of gestures we still need to find out, but even then, if we found a bottleneck we can engineer a solution, that's the risk with innovation, the good thing is that is precisely on these bottlenecks that ingenious solutions are found and a breakthrough happens, ""necessity is the mother of all inventions""</p>
</div><div>
<h3>Other Ways You Can Help</h3>
<p>So you have reach this far and we already like you for it, thanks for taking your time to hear us, if you want to contribute but you don't have the money to do so, maybe you can help us by bringing awareness that we exist and we are trying to make a difference,  share it with someone that may like the idea and contribute, help comes in many forms, and we accept all of them, remember to use the Indiegogo share tools, and once again thank you for time ;)</p>

So the conception of the highly useful wristband was brought to life. It offers two ways for users to wear GoPro cameras on the wrist for instant access while traveling or engaging in activities.

Why you need it?

hybrid strap is the perfect addition to your GoPro. It can be used for a variety of  situations. First of all, it is comfortable and convenient to bring with you to everywhere and capture immediately

While existing wristbands are not flexible enough for some action like selfie... hybrid strap can quickly unlock and use it as a safety hand strap! 



More flexible to take great photos & videos!





Unlock both sides to become a camera standDetails

hybrid strap is compact, stylish, and highly useful in action photography



Compact buckle with matte finishing




Elastic strap with two different textures



Elastic material with large range of size adjustment. Fits wrists from 140 - 210 mm


*Prototype by 3D printing for illustrate the concept only. The finishing of actual product will be meticulous



Comparison with existing solutions












Unlike many wristband straps, hybrid strap can quickly unlock so that it can be used as a safety hand strap. It allows users
to place their GoPro in a variety of positions to quickly facilitate the
capture of on-the-go photos in almost any situation with ease.  Users can quickly shift back and forth between
camera positions for the greatest flexibility in photography. Just like the gesture of how we use other camera!

<b></b><p><b>Q: </b>Does It Work With My Smartphone?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> Currently, Apple has incorporated NFC capabilities into their devices but restrict the usage to their Apple pay feature. There are cases and add-ons to make iPhones compatible.</p>
<p>Many newer android phones, windows phone, and more are now NFC enabled. We've tested these watches with the Samsung Note 2 and 4 and Samsung Galaxy S5.</p>
<p><b>Q: </b>How Durable Is The Watch?</p>
<p><b>A: </b>Here is an <a href=""http://youtu.be/yTxZkAOsuwo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">EXTREME TORTURE TEST</a></p>
<p><b>Q: </b>Is it water resistant?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> It not meant to withstand more than splashes.</p>
<p>In the <a href=""http://youtu.be/yTxZkAOsuwo"" rel=""noopener nofollow"">Torture Test</a>, we found that when submerged in water, it will stop working but when it dries off then it'll work again</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>Q: </b>What is the operating distance?</p>
<p><b>A:</b> Near Field Communication means that you need to be close to a device. It depends on the device. Approx 2-5cm<br/><b>Q: </b>What is the thickness?</p>
<p><b>A: </b>7.7mm -<b> </b>9.3mm Depending on the model. The watch is much thinner than most watches.</p>

Risks and Challenges
Risks:
There are very minimal risks. If you were to purchase a watch, it is guaranteed that you'll receive one. Why? Because, though it is slow, we can already manufacture these watches.
Challenges:
Production speed: We don't know if our production rate could keep up with potential demand.
Also, with not enough funding, manufacturing speed and may not allow us to stock up on our product after our campaign.   
FAQs (Sorted A-Z)
Q: Does It Work With My Smartphone?
A: Currently, Apple has incorporated NFC capabilities into their devices but restrict the usage to their Apple pay feature. There are cases and add-ons to make iPhones compatible.

<h3>So, what's the story?</h3>
<p>While I was born and brought up in India, I went to a small liberal-arts college in upstate New York for my undergraduate education. Though my time in the States was not quite like my favorite teenage Hollywood film of the time, American Pie, I had an absolutely amazing time and made some lifelong friends. Several of my friends would visit India each year and end up going to Jaipur. My guy friends would often out-shop my gal friends, buying many block-printed shirts from tiny stores and artisan villages, where they were available for affordable prices. They would then flaunt these spicy shirts over the weekend, when we were grilling and chilling, tailgating or Sunday-fundaying.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Therefore, during my time in America I gained a deep appreciation for Indian textiles as I saw how fabrics such as gingham, madras, seersucker and others, with roots in India, had found their way to clothing brands such as Vineyard Vines and Chubbies, that were popular amongst my friends.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>In the Western World, hand-made textiles from India tend to be quite expensive and are reserved for expensive fashion labels. However, through Mangrove Supply, we aim to flood the mass market with insanely cool, hand crafted Indian fabrics in the form of vibrant weekend-wear so you can have access to the real deal. It’s impossible not to have a great time wearing these shirts, we dare you to try.</p>

<p>The Journey to the Iconic Halocline Dive Watch</p>
<p>I began this journey as an enthusiast with a dream! Most of us thumb through Facebook groups and other forums looking at watches for hours. Then spending several more hours researching the watches that we have seen in the many posts we viewed. As enthusiasts we always look at these watches and think of what we would do different had we designed that watch. And if you are like myself, you might also have a sketch pad with hundreds or maybe even thousands of watch sketches. This is where you could say Iconic Timepieces was born. A very rough birth as you can see, but this was the beginning!</p>
<p>As you can see, the Halocline went through many transformations before landing on the final design.</p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1602790073/m0nzvnsvzz1it4mcu0y9.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p>Being a member of the Microbrand Watch Community, I wanted to get the community involved. I wanted to include them on the design process. So I began posting this very rough sketch on Facebook and asking the community for their feedback. At this point the Halocline began to transform into what it is today. We went through many design aspects as well as colorways and hand options. I took all the suggestions and created enough to send out for prototypes. We even went through a few name changes before settling on the Hampton Bay. We landed on Hampton Bay because Hampton is my middle name, and Bay because it is a classy looking dive watch design. We thought we had the final name in place as you can see on the prototypes and we went with Hampton Bay, however, we decided to change the name once again to avoid any issues in the future from other brands that have used the name Hampton Bay on their watches. After all Iconic Timepieces is all about bringing the market something unique, so the model name should be unique as well. We landed on Halocline because of the beauty of seeing the layers transition from crystal clear to foggy and dense, much like the dials fading from solid colors to the icy white in the center. In the end we feel this name better suits this unique timepiece. </p>
<p>The Prototypes Arrive</p>

<p>Best of the Best</p>
<p>I wanted to share this experience with my follow watch enthusiasts because most of us don't get to see all the moving parts on the back end. It is very easy to criticize watch designs when you don't know all that goes into bringing a watch from concept to reality. This is where the real work begins. From finding the right manufacturing and supply chains to communicating your concept to having your prototypes come out correctly. I will say that being a community member and knowing what the consumer and myself see as quality does give Iconic Timepieces an advatage because quality and price point are key factors in bringing this dream to the market.  </p>

<p>Halocline</p>
<p>Halocline, vertical zone in the oceanic water column in which salinity changes rapidly with depth, located below the well-mixed, uniformly saline surface water layer. Especially well developed haloclines occur in the Atlantic ocean, in which salinities may decrease by several parts per thousand from the base of the surface layer to depths of about one kilometre (3,300 feet). In higher latitudinal areas of the North Pacific in which solar heating of the surface waters is low and rainfall is abundant, salinities increase markedly with depth through the halocline layer. Pycnoclines, or layers through which water density increases rapidly with depth, accompany such haloclines inasmuch as density varies directly with total salt content.</p>

<p>My name is David Ramirez and I am totally passionate about watches.</p>
<p>I am particularly obsessed by vintage watches: made with the very best materials and with almost magically constructed automatic mechanisms, unfortunately these works of art have also always had a correspondingly high price, only within reach of a small, privileged group of people.</p>
<p>During my long career in the watchmaking sector, I kept thinking that there had to be some way to share my passion and create a high quality “vintage” watch at a more affordable price. Finally, when I’d discovered all the ingredients to make it happen, Tempore Lux watches was born, with a clear objective to offer timepieces of the highest quality at a fair price.</p>

<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>“But David, how can you create a high quality watch at such an affordable price?”</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://media.giphy.com/media/W1SREagIk8lNGfUVzs/giphy.gif"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Quite simply: by employing direct distribution, going from the brand straight to the final customer. By eliminating all the (expensive) middlemen, we realize huge savings for you, our customers. In this way, we can offer you a high quality watch at a much lower price.</p>

<p>After an extensive search I found the perfect graphic design team and we started creating the first sketches.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Finding a factory that could guarantee the quality we wanted was not an easy task either, but finally, after rejecting several companies, we found a manufacturer in Hong Kong that provided us with the high quality that we demanded and we started to manufacture the first prototypes.</p>

<p>Primary to Tempore Lux is ensuring an extremely high quality in every aspect of its timepieces. It is why we have taken as much time and effort as necessary to select exclusive components of the highest quality for each of our watches. </p>

<p><strong>The case is 316L stainless steel brushed surgical grade</strong>, the standard of high-end swiss watch brands.</p>
<p><strong>The ceramic bezel</strong> is of an exceptional quality, extraordinarily hard and resistant to scratches. This will keep your watch looking like new for years, avoiding the horrible micro scratches that you get with metallic bevels. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561930021/xfpjgfpltyhjgh59tfrz.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>The Crystal is made of Sapphire with anti-reflection treatment AR COATING</strong>, practically unbreakable and resistant to scratches.</p>
<p>For the luminescence of our watches we have chosen the highest grade of the famous Swiss brand RC Tritec. Its <strong>Super-Luminova BGW9</strong> is the preferred choice by the manufacturers of high-end diver watches, due to its great visibility in the dark and its characteristic blue tone. In our watches, BGW9 is incorporated in the hands, hour markes and in the bezel.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The true nature of a watch is what is inside: the mechanism is the heart that gives life to these magnificent machines. And when it comes to the internal aspects of a watch, there are no better pedigrees than the Swiss or Japanese movements.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561930473/dd3vqhfznylg94kybl0u.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>After much study and debate, we concluded that the SEIKO/TMI brand mechanisms offered the high quality, precision and durability that we required. More affordable than comparable Swiss movements, the SEIKO/TMI mechanisms also had a price-point that still met our goal of creating high quality watches at an fair price. </p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>For the V ONE series we opted for the Premium Mechanical Sll NE15: </strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561930553/rjun6w299dvg1vhukqnb.png"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The<strong> SEIKO SII NE15</strong> is a high-performance automatic movement that has more than <strong>50 hours of power reserve at 21,600 vibrations per hour (3Hz), 24 rubies and also supports manual load.</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>For the V ONE CHRONOGRAPH series the Premium Chronograph Sll VK64 Meca Quartz:</strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561930656/nurmyjksditsalheauql.png"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The <strong>SEIKO VK64</strong> is a hybrid mechanism between quartz and mechanical, with two different modules working together. The hour and minute functions (it has no seconds hand) are controlled by a quartz precision movement, while the chronograph functions are performed by a mechanical module; in this way, it works like an automatic chronograph mechanism.</p>
<p> </p>
<p> </p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561938722/ex1m8fenpzdrorxl9m0p.jpg"" src=""""/></p>

<p> </p>
<p><strong>For the V ONE series the Swiss Automatic SELLITA caliber SW200-1: </strong></p>
<p><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561938968/yvzymk3qhtut11z0381m.jpg"" src=""""/></p>
<p> </p>
<p>A  real pillar of Swiss watchmaking, the SW200-1 is precise, reliable and  robust. The SW200-1 is well able to equip all types  of watches, from the most sports-orientated to the most elegant.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>For the V ONE CHRONOGRAPH series the Swiss Automatic Chronograph SELLITA caliber SW510-BH: </strong></p>
<p><strong><img class=""lazy"" data-src=""https://c1.iggcdn.com/indiegogo-media-prod-cld/image/upload/c_limit,w_695/v1561939054/fjlcd2avnrpsly9d74mm.jpg"" src=""""/></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p>The  SW510 BH is the «bicompax» version of the SW500. The SW510 therefore offers a traditional chronograph layout. Quick setting of the date is activated via the crown.</p>

</div></div>","Inspired by the magnificent classic diver watches of the 60’s and 70’s, Tempore Lux watches has journeyed into the past and united tradition with the most modern of timepiece technologies.
Now, after 3 years of meticulous design, we are ready to present our premiere collection of watches: the VINTAGE ONE.
 

 
The VINTAGE ONE is a robust diver watch that is waterproof to 300m (1,000ft) depth. Its 44mm brushed solid steel 316L case features a unidirectional ceramic bezel and sapphire crystal with AR COATING anti-reflection treatment. The hands, hour markers and bezel markers are filled with Superluminova BGW9.
 

 
The VINTAGE ONE comes in two versions: 

 V ONE series with a Seiko Premium Mechanical SII NE15 automatic mechanism
 V ONE CHRONOGRAPH series with a Premium Chronograph VK64 Meca-Quartzmechanism (also from Seiko)

 

 


 
 

 
My name is David Ramirez and I am totally passionate about watches.
I am particularly obsessed by vintage watches: made with the very best materials and with almost magically constructed automatic mechanisms, unfortunately these works of art have also always had a correspondingly high price, only within reach of a small, privileged group of people.
During my long career in the watchmaking sector, I kept thinking that there had to be some way to share my passion and create a high quality “vintage” watch at a more affordable price. Finally, when I’d discovered all the ingredients to make it happen, Tempore Lux watches was born, with a clear objective to offer timepieces of the highest quality at a fair price.
 
 

 
 
 
“But David, how can you create a high quality watch at such an affordable price?”
 

 
Quite simply: by employing direct distribution, going from the brand straight to the final customer. By eliminating all the (expensive) middlemen, we realize huge savings for you, our customers. In this way, we can offer you a high quality watch at a much lower price.
 
 

 
 
After an extensive search I found the perfect graphic design team and we started creating the first sketches.
 

 
Finding a factory that could guarantee the quality we wanted was not an easy task either, but finally, after rejecting several companies, we found a manufacturer in Hong Kong that provided us with the high quality that we demanded and we started to manufacture the first prototypes.
 

 
 

 
 
Primary to Tempore Lux is ensuring an extremely high quality in every aspect of its timepieces. It is why we have taken as much time and effort as necessary to select exclusive components of the highest quality for each of our watches. 
 


 
The case is 316L stainless steel brushed surgical grade, the standard of high-end swiss watch brands.
The ceramic bezel is of an exceptional quality, extraordinarily hard and resistant to scratches. This will keep your watch looking like new for years, avoiding the horrible micro scratches that you get with metallic bevels. 
 

 
The Crystal is made of Sapphire with anti-reflection treatment AR COATING, practically unbreakable and resistant to scratches.
For the luminescence of our watches we have chosen the highest grade of the famous Swiss brand RC Tritec. Its Super-Luminova BGW9 is the preferred choice by the manufacturers of high-end diver watches, due to its great visibility in the dark and its characteristic blue tone. In our watches, BGW9 is incorporated in the hands, hour markes and in the bezel.
 
 

 
The V ONE and V ONE CHRONOGRAPH share the same case and dimensions:
 

The back casing is fastened with six screws for the V ONE and threaded for the V ONE CHRONOGRAPH.
 

 
 
 

 
 
The true nature of a watch is what is inside: the mechanism is the heart that gives life to these magnificent machines. And when it comes to the internal aspects of a watch, there are no better pedigrees than the Swiss or Japanese movements.
 

 
After much study and debate, we concluded that the SEIKO/TMI brand mechanisms offered the high quality, precision and durability that we required. More affordable than comparable Swiss movements, the SEIKO/TMI mechanisms also had a price-point that still met our goal of creating high quality watches at an fair price. 
 
For the V ONE series we opted for the Premium Mechanical Sll NE15: 
 

 
The SEIKO SII NE15 is a high-performance automatic movement that has more than 50 hours of power reserve at 21,600 vibrations per hour (3Hz), 24 rubies and also supports manual load.
 
For the V ONE CHRONOGRAPH series the Premium Chronograph Sll VK64 Meca Quartz:
 

 
The SEIKO VK64 is a hybrid mechanism between quartz and mechanical, with two different modules working together. The hour and minute functions (it has no seconds hand) are controlled by a quartz precision movement, while the chronograph functions are performed by a mechanical module; in this way, it works like an automatic chronograph mechanism.
 
 

 
 
For the V ONE series the Swiss Automatic SELLITA caliber SW200-1: 

 
A  real pillar of Swiss watchmaking, the SW200-1 is precise, reliable and  robust. The SW200-1 is well able to equip all types  of watches, from the most sports-orientated to the most elegant.
 
For the V ONE CHRONOGRAPH series the Swiss Automatic Chronograph SELLITA caliber SW510-BH: 

 
The  SW510 BH is the «bicompax» version of the SW500. The SW510 therefore offers a traditional chronograph layout. Quick setting of the date is activated via the crown.
 

 
Details of the V ONE dial:
 

 
 
 

 
 
 
Tempore Lux straps and bracelets are made from the highest quality materials, providing both elegance and durability.  
 

 
Three options are offered: 
 

316L stainless steel bracelet MESH (Milanese) with double safety folding clasp, solid and elegant.
 

 
 
High quality Italian leather strap with buckle closure in 316L steel, the preferred choice for luxury watch brands.
 

 
 
High quality rubber strap with buckle closure in 316L steel, the rubber straps are the most used in Swiss watchmaking for theirs excellent quality.
 

 
With your Tempore Lux watch you can choose between an Italian leather strap, a steel mesh bracelet or a black rubber strap, but you can also buy additional pieces. 
 

 
Our leather straps and rubber straps have a quick-change system, allowing you to change straps in seconds with just one finger. Effortlessly change the style of your watch at any time!

Traditionally, designing, manufacturing and marketing a high quality watch like the V ONE would require sums of money and risks that were beyond the reach of an artisan team like ours.
Thanks to crowdfunding, we now have the opportunity to perfect and fine-tune our product. With the support and collaboration of hundreds or thousands of people like yourselves, it is possible to bring a product of love like this to market.
With your backing we can make our dreams – and yours – a reality!

<span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;"">Reveal's founder, Terry Omata, is from Seattle, WA. He developed a passion for social responsibility when he took his first job with the non-profit organization, Teach for America. There he taught and coached kids from all walk of life. Helping children reach their full potential was one of his most rewarding experiences and helped shape the way he looks at the world around us.</span>
</div>
<div><span style=""letter-spacing: 0px;""><br/></span></div>
<p>After teaching, Terry was offered the exciting chance to get involved in a career in consumer electronics.  For the last decade, he and his team members have designed, developed, and helped produce audio accessories for some of the largest retailers and brands around the globe. </p>
<p>So why are we doing this?  After watching countless products roll off

</div></div>","MORE THAN JUST HEADPHONES
IMAGINE A WORLD WHERE:

Every purchase you make directly improves someone's life…
Non-profits are just as important as for-profits... 
The biggest fashion statement is a social statement…




Reveal was founded with a mission to design products that reveal organizations making a difference.  Our new Headphone Collection connects you to your music and the causes you care about such as hunger, AIDS, education, reforestation and clean water.
Here at Reveal, we are a team of idealistic, product design and manufacturing experts who love music and have a mission beyond producing the next product that everyone will simply ""consume"".   
By supporting Reveal, you are supporting not only these cool headphones, but the idea of changing the way people give back.   With your help, we can keep innovating cool products in the audio space and design the next generation of earphones and speakers that are inspired by great causes.    


5 COLORS, 5 CAUSES, 5 AMAZING NON-PROFITS


 

783 million people worldwide do not have access to clean, drinkable water, and 1 out of every 5 deaths of children under 5 is due to a water-related disease.  Water For People has the goal of complete water coverage for every family, every school, and every clinic. For every pair of blue headphones pledged, you provide 2 weeks of clean water for a family.

     

76% of children with AIDS are not receiving the treatment needed to survive.  Keep a Child Alive believes that every child has the right to health care. For every pair of red headphones pledged, you provide 5 days of medicine and care to a child with AIDS. 
              



34 million children suffer from acute malnutrition worldwide. Action Against Hunger is committed to ending hunger by feeding those in need in over 40 countries.  For every pair of orange  headphones pledged, you provide 5 days of therapeutic food for a malnourished child.  
               




12-15 million hectares of forest
are lost every year (36 football fields per minute).  American Forests has battled this by
planting more than 46 million trees worldwide since 1990. 
Every time a tree is planted, our environment improves and the air is cleaner.  For every pair of green headphones pledged, you plant FIVE trees.           









773 million people worldwide are illiterate.  Room to Read promotes literacy and gender equality in education by building schools, establishing libraries, publishing children’s books, and training educators.  For every pair of black headphones pledged, you provide 5 books for children in Asia & Africa.


WHY HEADPHONES FOR CHARITY?
               

In today's digitally connected world - chic, high performance headphones are not just an audio device, but also a fashion accessory people do not leave home without.  Reveal Headphones are an effortless way to express your personal style AND show solidarity with a cause you believe in.

We see a big void in the audio and technology industry of products that give back.  We love audio and technology accessories, but feel that there is a great opportunity to change the industry that we work in.
Our team members have helped many major brands and retailers produce audio products, but this time we're excited to be making them for you and the causes you care about.  Rest assured, our years of expertise allows you to get the best quality product while raising money for some of the top rated non-profits around.
Each eye-catching color headphone has been matched to a specific cause and metric that will be carried out by the charity.  See how YOU will be making a difference by pledging today:





BRING ON THE PERKS!When
you join us in changing the world by pledging for one or more headphones,
you'll receive the following perks:
Crowdfunding with Indiegogo allows us to maximize the amount of donation to the nonprofits in comparison with selling in brick and mortar retail stores.  Yes, that's right.  More goes to the nonprofit and the people in need.  More reason to act right now!  Our vision of cool audio products making the world a better place will become a reality with your support spreading the word on Indiegogo today.REVEAL NOISE ISOLATION PERFORMANCE HEADPHONESThese badboys have been developed with fashion and performance in mind.  Here are just a few key specs that make these your next perfect pair of headphones:
Dynamic Stereo Sound
Compatible With All Devices 
Lightweight Design Ideal for Everyday Wear 
Rubberized Soft Touch Cable and Housing 
Sealed in-ear Construction Design to Block Out External Noise
Flat Chord Helps Prevent Tangling
Extra Earbud Cushions (multiple sizes included)
OUR SCHEDULEWe have had plenty of high demands from big box retailers and major brands to produce the best possible product with on-time delivery.  So rest assured, we will do the same for you:PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD & SHARE!We are allocating a very small part of your pledge towards our marketing budget for this project, because we want the money to go where it is best used – our partner charities.That means we can use every ounce of help we can get from you and anyone you know.  Please contribute or if that is not possible, you can still help us by sharing it with others via Facebook, Twitter, Email, Smoke Signals, or however you want!

WHO WE ARE


Reveal's founder, Terry Omata, is from Seattle, WA. He developed a passion for social responsibility when he took his first job with the non-profit organization, Teach for America. There he taught and coached kids from all walk of life. Helping children reach their full potential was one of his most rewarding experiences and helped shape the way he looks at the world around us.


After teaching, Terry was offered the exciting chance to get involved in a career in consumer electronics.  For the last decade, he and his team members have designed, developed, and helped produce audio accessories for some of the largest retailers and brands around the globe. 
So why are we doing this?  After watching countless products roll off 
the assembly line, we realized there was a genuine need for an audio brand
 that was more than just specs and functionality; a brand that would 
help bring enjoyment to listeners, and also help changes lives.
Risks & Challenges


We’ve been a part of the crowdfunding contributing side before and believe us: we understand that putting your hard earned money toward a crowdfunded venture can be “risky.” 
But rest assured, manufacturing and delivering quality earphones is our expertise and we've been doing it for years for other major brands and retailers.  And we've thoroughly vetted all our non-profit partners, making sure that your pledges go to helping people and our planet.
Everything from manufacturing to fulfillment is in line and ready for us to hit GO!  So let’s get this project funded and start changing lives.

I struggled with moving forward because I thought that I was too young or unable to really make an impact in my surroundings through fashion. Now as a blogger, international spoken word champion(poet), and college freshman double majoring in fashion design &amp; business marketing, I began to ask God to take my hands and amplify my purpose on this earth.

<p>So our mission with TrimX, was to empower people to re-gain control over their body. Why are we saying re-gain? Well because life, work, kids, friends can quickly take all of our time, which gives you limited time to train. This means that when you do, it better be at it's best.</p>
<p>More effective, more results, and more powerful!</p>

<p><strong>2. Are the gel pads reusable?</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align: left;"">The most compelling results were obtained following a 10-week, triple-blind, placebo-controlled study.

<p style=""text-align: left;"">In addition, the results demonstrated that both groups lost the same amount of overall fat.

</div></div>","Following up on the previous technologies out there, we wanted to create a tool that would enhance workout benefits - more energy, lower adipose (fat) tissue and an increase of the lipolytic activity. We worked tirelessly to introduce you TrimX the world’s first fat spot reduction wearable technology clinically proven to allow you to gain control over your body.Simply put, TrimX is your tool for trimming while exercising because sometimes training 2-3 times a week is just not enough to get rid of the stubborn fat. In fact, as we age, some areas accumulate fat which becomes harder to lose. Over the last 12 years, we elaborated, analysed, tested, retested, and proved with 4 clinical trials that fat spot can be reduce with electric activity. It doesn't require a high volume of energy to activates your lipolytic activity, As a matter of fact, after 15-25 min (more or less) that's when you start to experience fat loss when exercising. The only thing you need with TrimX to make it work is gel pads that allows you, at the same time, to targets the stubborn fat  zones you want to get rid of. 


 
We've presented the technology to few medias out there, because like most of you, they weren't convince that it had proven results or that it just works.
Read their comments below to know what they really thought afterwards. 

 
On the other hand, we know those mentions aren't enough. Clearly, you need more proof and so did we, because we are soooo used to being told that there isn't a miracle tool for effective fat-burning.  It's absolutely TRUE! There's isn't, none, nada! What is real and working is EXERCISING! That's how we developed TrimX, as a tool to incorporate in your daily workout routine to -only- maximise fat loss. Read: lipolytic activity. 
 
Below 
-
You can listen to our testers from the 4th clinical trial.
p.s. Don't trust us, listen for yourself!
 



So our mission with TrimX, was to empower people to re-gain control over their body. Why are we saying re-gain? Well because life, work, kids, friends can quickly take all of our time, which gives you limited time to train. This means that when you do, it better be at it's best.
More effective, more results, and more powerful!



 

TrimX uses non-invasive gel pads to send very-low electric current into targeted fat zones. 
1. Does it hurt?
- No, in fact you barely feel it when you're not working out, so when you do you don't feel anything at all. 
2. Are the gel pads reusable?
- Of course you can use each of them up to 20 times, even more if you put the spray on it. (included in the box)
3. After how many days-weeks should I start seeing results?
- Results from the clinical trials showed that you start really noticing a difference after 5 weeks and then it's a little like a snowball, it keeps on increasing over time. Some men even lost more than 3 inches in less than 10 weeks.
 
Here's a little video explaining how it works. Quite simple indeed.

Safety
EFS is a proven and hazard-free technology, widely supported by many studies. In fact it has its origins in medicine. Our product has been vetted by Health Canada and their USA and Europe equivalent will soon do likewise. We always make sure our products comply with the highest quality and safety standards and are therefore completely safe to use.
Delivery
The delivery of the products in Canada, USA, Australia, South Korea and Europe is planned to start in June 2017.

If you have kids, you know those sweethearts can be messy! If you take just one minute of ""me time"" you will return to find them coloring on walls, painting with Vaseline, or simply dumping out toys all over the house. As a mother of four young kids I've been there! I am still there. :) 


 We have a revolutionary, patent-pending product. We've tested prototypes. We've lined up the manufacturing. Now we just need your support to help fund the first production run.
Mother May I bins are unique because they are easy for adults to open, but not for kids.




Our childproof bins are a great way to control access to things like markers, scissors, detergent pods, or treats. You can even use them for toys to keep them organized, limiting the mess to one bin at a time.
There is nothing like this on the market today. Crazy, huh?  How it works... Our patent pending product requires two adult-sized hands to open. The buttons on the lid are spaced further apart than what a child-sized hand can reach. Even if a child uses two hands to press two of the buttons, the other set of buttons will keep the lid secure.


Mother May I bins give you control well beyond other childproofing products on the market.




Toy Storage It is time to rethink toy storage and organization. 

Traditional toy bins don't keep toys organized. It might take 30 minutes to organize toys into separate bins and 30 seconds to undo it all!  


Many of us resort to boxing up toys and storing them out of sight where they may as well be thrown away. 


Or we just give up on organization and throw everything into one large toy chest. Good luck finding Mr. Potato Head's arms or Barbie's clothes. 

Our childproof bins let you keep toys organized and available without giving up on a clean house.


Markers, Crayons, Scissors etc.
Childproof bins are the best way to keep crayons, markers and pencils off your walls and in your control.


Detergent pods

""Calls to poison control centers increased 17% from 2013-2014... More than 22,000 children, mostly under age 3, were exposed to laundry packets"" - Laundry packet poisonings increase in kids - CNN April 2016.
Doctors strongly suggest parents keep these products out of the reach of children.  Our bins are the perfect addition to your childproofing safety plan.

TV remotes
OK kids, who took the remote? Seriously, where is the remote? You have 15 chew toys, why do you always go for the remote!?

<p><strong>Knowledge gives us the warm fuzzies</strong><br/>What's not to love about an intelligent jacket that keeps you warm and toasty all over? </p>
<p>For those who may be teetering on the edge of like and love, we've put together some frequently-asked-questions about the 2Degree Jacket and our answers to them.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How long will it keep me warm?</strong><br/>A: Users can expect from the 2Degree Jacket:<br/>- 2 hours at the maximum setting<br/>- 3-8 hours during temperature regulation (depending on outside temperature and user setting)<br/>- 10+ hours at lowest setting</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the temperature range for the 2Degree Jacket?</strong><br/>A: Our jacket has been tested down into the 30s (that's degrees Fahrenheit). We continue to collect data and refine the final design for optimal comfort in the first release. </p>
<p><strong>Q: This jacket won’t work for me on the ski slope/construction site/North Pole.</strong><br/>A: First, that wasn’t a question. Second, we designed the 2Degree Jacket with fashion in mind.

That's why our team of engineers and designers spent months developing the 2Degree Jacket's advanced electronics and heating technology and styling it to look smart.  The resulting product delivers the ideal combination of smart and good-looking: The sleek 2Degree Jacket links to the user's iPhone or Android mobile device to automatically maintain its temperature. Be warm and look good at the same time. Get on board early with 2Degree by helping us bring this product to the market.     A jacket that looks great on the town or at the officeWe collaborated with one of the top fashion schools in the country to combine our sophisticated thermal control technology with the latest fashion trends to produce a jacket that looks as great as it functions. 2Degree keeps you warm on the inside and hot on the outside.             2Degree Jacket Color Options:     Fabric: Light weight, waterproof, premium faux leather designed for apparel and accessories. Available in S, M, L, XL and XXL sizes for men and women. Advanced heating that works like graphene, but on steroidsWe worked with GrafTech International, a global graphite technology company, to develop our patent-pending heating system that marries the best in flexible, breathable and rugged technology with superior heat distribution. The electronics are undetectable to the user. The combination provides an unprecedented user experience of controlled, uniform warmth without the bulk and hotspots of other heated garment options.                         2Degree features the most advanced control system ever used in a heated garment. It dynamically controls power to deliver a precise heating level. All of this is made possible by a powerful microprocessor paired with Bluetooth® connectivity.The jacket monitors internal jacket temperature, external temperature, and the weather for optimal user comfort. Advanced algorithms determine the level of heating needed.     Advanced battery technology delivers all-day power for the jacket and your phone via a USB charging port. These batteries are distributed throughout the jacket, becoming almost invisible to the wearer. Most importantly, charging takes place via our patent-pending hanger and does not require the battery to be removed: you simply hang the jacket, and it charges.          
 




 

                                            
 

 


 
Knowledge gives us the warm fuzziesWhat's not to love about an intelligent jacket that keeps you warm and toasty all over? 
For those who may be teetering on the edge of like and love, we've put together some frequently-asked-questions about the 2Degree Jacket and our answers to them.
Q: How long will it keep me warm?A: Users can expect from the 2Degree Jacket:- 2 hours at the maximum setting- 3-8 hours during temperature regulation (depending on outside temperature and user setting)- 10+ hours at lowest setting
Q: What is the temperature range for the 2Degree Jacket?A: Our jacket has been tested down into the 30s (that's degrees Fahrenheit). We continue to collect data and refine the final design for optimal comfort in the first release. 
Q: This jacket won’t work for me on the ski slope/construction site/North Pole.A: First, that wasn’t a question. Second, we designed the 2Degree Jacket with fashion in mind. Fall through spring, it's perfect for getting around town in style, such as shopping, dining al fresco or walking to work. The 2Degree Jacket is not designed for industrial or sub-zero applications; however, we're pretty sure it's going to be on everyone's holiday wish list, so we'll make sure the big guy at the North Pole gets the heads up.  
Q: What if my phone is taken by aliens?A: Really? Aliens? Luckily for you, your jacket can still work without your phone, just not in ""temperature control mode."" The 2Degree Jacket can be adjusted manually to a low or high heat setting. You're on your own with regards to smart phone hostage negotiations with Martians. Maybe give them a 2Degree Jacket in exchange?
Q: When do I select my reward jacket gender, size and color choice?A: At the conclusion of the successful Indiegogo campaign, you will be contacted with details and instructions regarding your selection.

Backpack technology has stagnated over the past years, as most designs are highly redundant and don't offer unique features. We believe that with our model we can offer the market something unique, innovative and really useful.  tinyurl.com/jbxcu49   Our Needs We believe that with just $500 we can develop a fully functional prototype for our product design. It will inlcude the following features:
 Wall Mounting Mechanism
Fold-able Table
Electroluminescent look achieved through LED Tape
Power Bank for charging your laptop/cell phones on the go. 

    The Impact 
The Lytpack is not just a concept; it’s a design that’s ready to be built and marketed to individuals. For 500 dollars, we’ll be able to create a fully-functional prototype to show to investors. Ultimately, Lytpack has the potential to capitalize on the rapid growth of the backpack industry by being a valuable, innovative and marketable consumer product.
Risks & Challenges Our backpack design is extremely unique, which is why while developing this prototype we might face some engineering challenges. But here at #Team Lytpak our co-founders have a strong engineering background and have our college engineering/technical faculty and resources on our side to help us face these challenges. 
    Other Ways You Can Help We understand everyone can't fund our project, but there are other ways to help. You can always vote for our design entry for the U-Ignite Competition and help us bring our idea to life.

</p><p>The Cuckoo clock has a long 
history, and the traditional cuckoo clock has existed since the early 1900's. 
People have adored the cuckoo clock's style for more than 100 years, but no one 
has made it as a wrist watch, until now!</p>
<p>Now watch maker SeaHope has 
partnered with a Japanese Toy factory, combining precision technology to create 
the First Wearable ""Cuckoo Watch""!</p>
<p>With amazing technology, 
making a thumb sized remote control robot (smaller than 35mm high) and utilizing 
special micro technology for this project, The Cuckoo Watch is a product no
